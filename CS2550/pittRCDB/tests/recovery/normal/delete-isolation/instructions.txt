test case: delete-isolation
description:
  verifies that a user can delete and recreate the same table several times in one transaction
  verifies that deleted tables are restored on the abort of a transaction
instructions:
  delete existing tables with "rm -rf tables"
  run "./pittRCDB roundrobin ./tests/recovery/normal/delete-isolation/delete-isolation-abort.txt"
  delete existing tables with "rm -rf tables"
    run "./pittRCDB roundrobin ./tests/recovery/normal/delete-isolation/delete-isolation-no-abort.txt"
expected behavior:
  after first operation, table should contain 4 records
  after second operation, table should contain 1 record
  after a transaction executes a delete, values which existed in that table before are no longer visible to it
  the only values the transaction may see in that table are those which it has itself inserted after the latest delete
