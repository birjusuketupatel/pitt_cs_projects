test case: large-txns
description:
  stress test where multiple large transactions to a single table are aborted
instructions:
  delete existing tables with "rm -rf tables"
  run "./pittRCDB roundrobin ./tests/recovery/benchmark/large-txns/with-abort.txt"
  delete existing tables with "rm -rf tables"
  run "./pittRCDB roundrobin ./tests/recovery/benchmark/large-txns/no-abort.txt"
expected behavior:
  both scripts dump state of all tables after execution
  entries may be in a different order, but all tables should contain the same values
