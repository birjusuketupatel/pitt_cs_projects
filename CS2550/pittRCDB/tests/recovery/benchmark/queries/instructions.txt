test case: queries
description:
  stress test where inserts, updates, and deletes to multiple tables are aborted
  runs queries on table to ensure that index structures are still working
instructions:
  delete existing tables with "rm -rf tables"
  run "./pittRCDB roundrobin ./tests/recovery/benchmark/queries/with-abort.txt"
  delete existing tables with "rm -rf tables"
  run "./pittRCDB roundrobin ./tests/recovery/benchmark/queries/no-abort.txt"
expected behavior:
  both scripts execute the same queries, and should give the same results
