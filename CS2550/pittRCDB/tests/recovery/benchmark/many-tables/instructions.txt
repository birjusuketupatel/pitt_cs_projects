test case: many-tables
description:
  stress test where inserts, updates, and deletes to multiple tables are aborted
instructions:
  delete existing tables with "rm -rf tables"
  run "./pittRCDB roundrobin ./tests/recovery/benchmark/many-tables/with-abort.txt"
  delete existing tables with "rm -rf tables"
  run "./pittRCDB roundrobin ./tests/recovery/benchmark/many-tables/no-abort.txt"
expected behavior:
  both scripts dump state of all tables after execution
  entries may be in a different order, but all tables should contain the same values
