The data shows that the least recently used algorithm performs very well on this dataset.
I ran the trace.1 file on the LRU and OPT algorithms at the memory splits specified for each of the 4 memory configurations.
OPT performed significantly better than LRU when the cache was a limited size (16 frames). However, at larger cache sizes, their results were similar.
In the largest case, when the cache contained 1024 frames and each page was 4 MB in size, their results were identical for each run.

Also, while OPT took about 10 seconds to run, LRU completed almost instantly.
Each memory access to the LRU cache is an O(1) operation, but for OPT, evictions took O(n) time, where n is the size of the cache.
