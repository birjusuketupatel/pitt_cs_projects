An almost reliable data transfer protocol.
Implemented all required portions, as well as extra credit 1, 2 and 3.

To print debug info, set the PRINT_DEBUG option in rt_rcv.c or rt_srv.c to 1 and recompile the code.

To use our protocol, set the REALTIME_PROTOCOL flag in rt_rcv.c to 1.

To use UDP only (for extra credit 2), set the flag to 0.

To use our dynamic protocol (for extra credit 3), use rt_srv_ec and rt_rcv_ec.

We include video streamed with our protocol, as well as a video streamed with raw UDP.
In case there is an issue with the videos in the .zip they are also available at:
