Alright everyone I’m proof that they are not just trying to censor big voices like info wars. I made a tweet to kate leth because she’s making an “anime” and I simply said something along the lines of “hey calling your cartoon an anime is false and you calling it an anime is taking a giant shit on the Japanese culture.” When I tried finding the tweet it was no where to be found. Everyone please support the fight against censorship. If they are willing to censor something big like infowars and something as small like myself who only as 25 followers, who pointed out something obviously to a sjw who through a hissy fit when I did so, whose to say that they won’t censor everyone in between. Info wars you now have my full support. Before I was just standing back letting others fight. NOW IM IN! LETS DO THIS! Hey bud what’s up like your news/style/intellect/fortitude/give-em hell bro and if you are ever in the Ozark area and are in need of a down straight up got your back white boy look know further just give me a call @ 2397757114.  Text me I don’t answer my phone too often.  Owen l was looking forward to meeting you steve quail Tom horn extra in Branson Mo. but I can’t make it stuck in Naples Florida until Monday.  Hey when those phony fagots on punk tube shut you guys down it sucked but I knew that minute that second it would be a big mistake and make Alex a martyr I hope the choice of words about fagots punks and pussys upsets the fagots punks and pussys and this channel or whatever it is is a platform for God fearing people.  I don’t have to tell you Yah doesn’t like fagots or cowards punks or pussys just saying.  It is good to see Alex putting his money where his mouth is another words he stoped talking about it and started being about it and that was good stuff with  Rubio Give-emHELLI believe the biggest threat to happiness on earth is the NWO movement.  I think the biggest thing we need right now is informing of others what is going on, and then taking action.  Right now, we still need more truth spread.  I like what people like Alex Jones is doing.  I want to know which organization I can donate to that will help spread truth but it has to be in bitcoin, because that's what I have and actually, I have a terminal illness and I will not be needing it. I don't have any family to give it to either.

If this sounds like a scam, then there is nothing I want from anyone or any contact information, just a website of an organization that is doing what I am asking for so I can check them out. Best to DM me. ~ThanksYou people actually follow this shit?Thousands of US-bound migrants storm Guatemala-Mexico border (VIDEO) https://www.rt.com/usa/441774-us-bound-migrants-guatemala-mexico/I don't know if you guys are on facebook much, but their is a very popular news page (with many different ones) called NowThis. It is geared towards the left crowd. They put this video out today, and it starts with "If you ever heard anyone say 9/11 was an inside job, it was because of this guy."  And then I heard from the Joe Rogan show that they was another purge of many pages that were anti establishment that no one really knew b/c it was on mainstream media. I put both videos below.

# Edit: I think they are just making sure their are no doubts what they did. The comments on the video says it all.I'm about to get my license, how much is it to add me (16) to my parents car insurance? Don't give me anything like, It's different for everyone." I know. Just tell me what you are payingI miss the chat storm that would usually fire up when the video of Alex giving the beat down to Frank, runs.

*We need your support Frank!*

*Frank!* ***FRAAAAAAAAAAAANK!***

Those where the days. :'(Even though we're sure that the Infowars is backing up all their text and videos, I am wondering if anyone out there is making duplicates and redundant duplicates of all their articles and keeping it in a safe archive we can all access it? I think this would be a very useful resource. Infowarsstore.com should start to offer USB drives with all of their published text content (if that's even possible). Or a flash drive with all of Alex's documentaries. We just need to get organized.

This might have to take several hundred people to carry out, if we're going to do it from the outside. It would also be nice to be able to locate things—even ones that have been taken down or retracted—chronologically and in the context of categories.Alex went on a pretty wild rant after the guilty verdicts on the manifort and Cohen trials.  I know he was frustrated but was he drunk too? Or just that tired? He sounded a little incoherent at times.

Insurance Question?
Insurance Question?


Cheap car insurance for an 18 year old?
 I'm hearing so many different things. Some people say you can use part of your parents' no claims to bring down the price, but I can't find any sites online who say that. Does anyone know of any cheap places or best companies to try by phone to get a realistic car insurance quote for an 18 year old?    Thanks in advance."


How can I find out if someone has made a claim against my car insurance?
 Back in December I was involved in a very minor fender bender. The guy was a total jerk about it I didn't want to deal with him so I told him to go to insurance. He kept threatening me with an insurance claim even though thats what I agreed to anyway. I stopped all contact with him because he just wanted money out of my pocket.   With my policy, I am given one free at-fault accident. This would fall under that, and my premium should not go up because of this.   Today I got my renewal notice, and my insurance premium will be decreasing this month.    I was never contacted by my insurance company, and I can't find the information on my online account with the company. Does this mean he didn't file a claim? Is there any way I can find out if there's any claims against my policy without calling the company?   Most claims stick for at least 5 years, and I would just like to know if there's anything against me in case I ever need to change providers.   Thanks!"

Why are NADA values so much lower than Kelley Blue Book Values?
 I've got a 96 Honda Accord EX V-TEC Coupe. I was recently in an accident and it wasn't my fault. My car is probably going to be totaled. The KBB values are accurate as to what my car would sell for retail in my area. If the insurance company goes by this value I make out good. The NADA values are so out of range their comical. If insurance goes by these values I'm screwed and I'll be forced to buy a pos junk mobile. The crazy thing is, theres probably thousands of 96 Accords but there's only about 3 other 96 Honda Accord EX V-TEC Coupe's for sale in the entire country and the price ranges from $6k-9K which is in line with KBB values. The prob is there so far away and theres only 3 so I don't have much to base values on. Should I go to my local dealerships and ask them what they'd sell the car for so I have something to back me up?"

Life Insurance Tax Deductions?
 ***OK** I think LB06029 is on the right track, but to clarify..... I heard that a business owner can put pre-tax money into a life insurance policy and get a deduction against their income from the business as a result. Meaning, A business owner has an extra 100K from the business, so they put it into a life insurance policy that acts like a pension plan."

No name cheap auto insurance for new driver? Please?..?
 My friend is 19 and she got her license less than a year ago. She has a car and is paying $200 per month on it and she needs insurance or she'll lose her car. However, every company out there wants her to pay between 400 and 600 dollars a month. Is there any cheap no name insurance that she can get? Anything less than 400 would be great..preferably between 200 and 300..but she'll take what she can get. Oh and she has gotten a ticket for speeding and she can't get on her moms insurance. She needs basic full coverage. Please help.."


Should I put commuting on my insurance?
 Hi, I work at Tesco near my house, 15 mins bus away. I work Monday to Saturday and I hardly take my car to work as I take the bus everyday. However, sometimes maybe 2-3 times month when I genuinely feel like, I may take my car to work, should I include commuting in my insurance even though I drive to work very rarely and I mostly either walk or take the bus to work? Because at the moment I have put social and pleasure only."


Hitting a car.. insurance policies?
 so back in April this year I hit someone s car and caused damage to the back of the person s car, he took my licence number and details then said he will contact his insurance to make a claim and then they will contact me I waited for a call from his insurance company or him but didn t get any call. After 8 months I got a call from his insurance company saying that the man has made a claim and want his car fixed so I asked for the reason for waiting 8 months and what was written in the claim but they said that they were not sure. I asked them to send me details about what is written in the claim and what is expected of me so they said it will be send by mail to my house. I originally had photos of the accident and the man s licence but I lost all my photos a while ago.   my question is should I be worried about this and why they waited months before complaining?  also is it possible for them to be involved in other accident and want to make it like it was because of my accident?  I contacted my insurance company and they said there are experts to check if the damage is recent or old but I still don t feel confident about it"

These are all of the articles I think are about this story. I do not select or
sort articles based on any opinions or perceived biases, and neither I nor my
creator advocate for or against any of these sources or articles. It is your
responsibility to determine what is factually correct.
Dang. It is complete. 😰😢Twitter IS actually in San Francisco. It on the Embarcadero. I'm surprised it took so long. People are loosing their f'ing mind out here since the election. I have one family member who won't even talk to me anymore. They now have suspended infowars both periscope accounts I would be willing to buy one of those usb drives if they ever sold them at infowasstore.com. but only if its super loaded with content.Hard copies are underestimated and underused. We certainly don't want them to back it up on iCloud hahaha.Did you guys all hear that they delisted the app? On playIs this supposed to be a joke? FmlAlso, I'm not Russian, I'm Mexican. In this russophobia climate I thought I'd have to make this clear. The frogs in Florida are gay. Why won't msm pick this up!?!?'vWho cares what porn he likes. 

But fuck alex jones forever. I hope he loses everything he's ever cared forThat's all you take from this ? Man, it must be sad being you.Is this on real.video?No one gives a shit, rot in Hell Alex Jones.

I’ve never read Alex Jones nor watched any of his video presence on the internet. A friend told me he was an extremist. Believe me that I know nothing about him. That said, I think banning him from the internet is a slippery slope. This is the beginning of real fascism. Trust me.

The whole world can see your number and some of the not so eloquent language in your message.It is on real.video @ https://www.real.video/5830425498001Hello,

I'm sorry if this doesn't interest you but over at /r/MHOC we are having a general election (they happen once every 6 months) and I would love it if you could spare a minute and vote. I'm a **National Unionist Party** candidate in this election standing in **East Midlands**.

If you want a party that truly represents you in the Commons and will stand against the Marxism and globalism which is plaguing the Commons then I suggest you vote for the National Unionist Party. We are a strongly Eurosceptic party, and will help deliver Brexit to the United Kingdom. Our members are brought together by traditionalism, conservatism and a love of this union. We proudly stand against attacks to the monarchy, Trident and on our proud traditions.

Unfortunately we are the **only** right wing party left in /r/MHOC as both the [Conservatives](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/213320202044178432/218841880429854721/Conservatives.png) and UKIP have sold out to the [left](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/213320202044178432/218857665512603648/NUP.png ) The UKIP leader has voted to [abolish the Lords and voted for secularisation](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/213320202044178432/218856109010714626/ukip3.png)! He is an [open](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/213320202044178432/218838476404031488/ukip-flag.png) liberal and cannot be trusted! While the Tories [enabled the far left to get into government by rejecting to support a deal with right wing bills](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/213320202044178432/218847764283523072/Tory_RSP.png )! Can we trust these parties to run Britain? No!

Help us restore Britain to its former glory and vote National Unionist Party in the General Election!

The National Unionist Party are standing in seven constituencies:

- Strathcylde and the Borders

- North and West Yorkshire

- Greater Manchester

- East Midlands

- Thames Valley

- Cornwall and Devon

- Kent and East Sussex

Feel free to post feedback in the comments. This is an undergraduate project however, so I was unable to go into the level of depth or complexity that I would have liked.I just want to know one thing. Somebody please tell me. Did Donald Trump reverse executive order 13603 as layed out by Obama or not?Did I miss something in school? Or is it for Inforwars or something?  Why? Did I miss something in school? Every single "i" in every word in every story is capitalized. Why is that? What is the point? I just have to say this since I am in class, im a veteran who is now a college student and what i see everyday here on campus is very sad. No wonder why our great country is going down the path of no return. I mean we have safe spaces and the whole nine yards I would never would i have believed it had i not started going to school and seeing it for myself.
