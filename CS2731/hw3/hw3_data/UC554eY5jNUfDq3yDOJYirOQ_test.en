* **Stuff on destiny's playlist**: We all watch destiny, so there's really not much point in posting stuff that most of us have already heard

* **Super popular stuff**: Songs don't have to be underground with only 20 views, but i'd rather avoid really popular songs that everyone has already heard of. There's no point in setting specific limits so use your judgement [](/NoTears)

* **Please limit the number of songs per post to 5**: several people suggested limiting the number of songs and I agree, it makes going through the comments easier and also requires more thought on which songs you pick

* **Try not to repost from the last thread**: Do a quick ctrl+f to see if someone already posted the song here or in the previous thread.

[](/Abathur)I think I remember destiny talking about project veritas and how they have cut an interview so that they look like the ones that have asked the questions first. Maybe I'm misremembering, but if I'm not, can someone link me the vod of it? Pointless question obviously, about as likely as JF winning the lawsuit.I vaguely remember watching a Destiny clip in which someone (a fan?) was calling in and they started yelling and ended the call going REEEEE (and possibly something about Mr. Mouton but I can't remember) 

Anyone know what I'm talking about? He should be shamed for being blatantly unfair when it comes to debates, either by shutting out any real intellectual opposition to the alt-right, or by rigging debates by pitting three alt-righters against one leftist, with biased "moderator" RaceWarsky joining in the dogpile.
[X-post from /r/facepalm:](http://reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/7uhgd2/dutertes_official_spokesperson_without_fake_news/)

I never wanted to take down anyone more than the Right. Those ugly short fat fucks. Those bountiful small brains. The intelligence of a literal retard. It honestly fucking hurts knowing that I'll never deplatform them, make them get a job at Mcdonalds, and laugh as Trump gets impeached. I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance to them deplatformed. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would God create something so fucking stupid? To fucking tantalise us? Fucking laugh in our faces!? Honestly guys, I'm just not fucking daijoubu anymore. Fuck.Over here we have a shared lines. These lines are owned by the government and all ISP's can offer on these lines. It makes it so that we have a choice between a lot of ISP's. In my postcode i can choose between 12 ISP's ranging from €22 per month for 20 down and 2 up up to €60 for 400 down and 40 up. 

I think there are a few main advantages to this way of offering services compared to the "free market". 

- The safekeeping of quality to all 
- The guarantee that there will not be a monopoly
- The safeguarding of competition
- The market is quite easy to enter

to expand a bit on these points I would like to look at the past of this system. When internet first became available the state had a company that offered internet as well, named KPN. This company has since been privatized completely, but in the beginning it made sure that there would not be a monopoly and the first mover advantage companies have would be mitigated. Also by having this baseline of service there would always be an option for people to choose from that has the bare bones. More and more competition arose the state moved away from this and privatized the company. The fact that this company existed made it so that the landscape would always be diverse and the fact that it is relatively easy to enter the market. To be an ISP in the Netherlands you dont need to lay down lines and the infrastructure because it is state owned. Healthcare works kinda in the same way over here
 
I just wanted to give some more information on how a free market can work while the government works for the peopleI've been seeing a multiplication of comments and posts of people that are becoming very afraid/anguished because of A.I. It seems the fear being promoted by Hawking and other usurpers is taking its toll, even among free thinkers of this sub.

You don't need to believe I know what I'm talking about. Just look at and assess the evidence I'm proposing here. And let me set the record straight.

Consciousness isn't secreted by the brain. The materialistic existential worldview has, for all intents and purposes, been falsified by science. See the [Princeton Noosphere](http://noosphere.princeton.edu/) results, [Rupert Sheldrake's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnA8GUtXpXY) statistical experiments, [Pear](http://www.princeton.edu/~pear/), anything coming out of the [Institute of Noetic Sciences](http://www.noetic.org/), or indeed [quantum mechanics itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_choice_quantum_eraser).

Therefore a computer can't be conscious. Anyone who thinks the [hard problem of consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness) can be solved with transistors and electronic circuits (or even by looking inside the physical brain) is therefore provably delusional.

AI won't move beyond highly-specialized tasks, at least in your lifetime, and that of your children and grand-children. 

Also, realize this: The internet is comparable to only 2 technologies before it: writing, and the printing press. All 3 have similarly decreased the cost of acquiring (and thus producing) ideas/knowledge. 

In the first 2 instances, this has allowed for new eras of truth, peace and prosperity to emerge (an order of magnitude faster each time). There is no reason to believe it will be any different this time. 

Sure, there are central planners that want an evil “new world order”. But they are crude and vulgar, and they will fail.

Finally, you have strictly nothing to fear, as [nothing can ultimately harm you.](https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5tdzyh/if_you_realize_all_your_sensory_experiences/)

Peace my friends.Does Destiny really ban all the people he claims he will, or is it just a big meme?He says that when he was a zygote that he wouldn't have wanted to be terminated. But the fact is that zygotes don't have wishes or desires, it's literally just some tissue. Infact, it's doesn't even make sense to say that you, as a person, ever were a zygote as persons are wholly psychological constructs and zygotes lack any of the prerequisites necessary for psychological facts to arise. 

Also, he says that the cutoff point should be at conception because any other cut off point will be arbitrary. But why does it necessarily need to be arbitrary? Why can't aim cut off point that is reasonable in the greatest amount of cases possible.Hi, I don't know if this point has been raised before here, so I'm sorry if I'm repeating something.

If I understood Destiny correctly, then he argues that at the moment of conception a human life is created, aborting which would be murder and therefore wrong.

Accepting for now that a zygote is a human worthy of equal moral consideration, wouldn't it still be a self-defence situation?

Over a nine-month period the fetus causes the mother considerable suffering. Nausea, pain, stress, emotional imbalance, being unable to work, weight gain and many more, usually ending in a several day hospitalization. These are to be expected even if everything goes well. But the potential for harm is a lot greater if not everything goes well. According to Wikipedia (complications of pregnancy) 31% of mothers suffer from long term health problems after pregnancy. And of course 0.023 percent (in the us) die during child birth.

My argument is, even if the zygote is to be considered a full fledged human albeit without any cognitive abilities, it is infringing on the rights of the mother so substantially, that self-defence is warranted.

When it comes to self-defence Destiny argued for using lethal force against someone who invaded his house to steal a saxophone. He argued stealing is a very serious offence to his rights. The value of the stolen goods is not just the money it costs, it's also the life-time you have to sacrifice at your job to make that money.

Now to draw the analogy to the pregnancy. The intruder - a human being, but let's say unconscious - in this case is not just in your house; the intruder is in your own body. And this intruder is not just indirectly taking your life-time by stealing a saxophone. The intruder is harming you, hurting you, impairing you, threatens your career, making you gain weight, causing psychological damage and sends you to the hospital, where you have a 31% chance of getting long term health problems and 0,023% chance of not even surviving.

You can't call the police on this intruder, you can't hide from them, you can't run away. There's no taser, no bat, no martial art you can use. All you have is the metaphorical gun 'abortion'. I argue, If you can pull the trigger on a thief, you can pull the trigger on this intruder for sure.It's from 2016 but Tonkas camera look like it's from 1999 https://youtu.be/rdwraRl26jcSo I've been trying to remember what it's called when you defend a narrative using other elements in the narrative, when the criticism is on the author.

Rules: You have to spend equal love-making time with each person in your chosen groupHello Destiny,

I was a fan of yours a long time ago, back in the SC2 days. I drifted away at some point, either when I lost interest in SC2 or when you swapped to LoL (I can't recall which). I recently rediscovered your YouTube channel and was very surprised to see it full of philosophical content. You were a very different person back in the day. I've now watched many of your debates and I'm really enjoying them as background entertainment. In many respects I think we share similar philosophies and values, and particularly the willingness to change our opinions, but furthermore the desire to be challenged in order to refine the opinions we hold. 

Since it seems that you do this for fun, I thought that I might present an argument that I am making myself (though I won't claim it's unique). I'm curious to know what your response to these arguments would be.

The issue I'm discussing today is your pro-life position on abortion. I'll preface this immediately by saying that I don't view us as opponents here in any respect: politically I am 100% satisfied that abortion is merely legal, and despite your philosophical position you've made it clear that you consider legalizing it pragmatic. This is a purely philosophical argument I'm making for my own entertainment, and hopefully yours too. In fact, personally I don't take the humanness of a fetus into consideration at all when considering how moral it is to terminate them, but I expect my rationale for this would be difficult and time-consuming to explain, and in the end it may just boil down to a fundamental difference in our core values that cannot be reconciled.

**Point 1: Can a zygote really "reciprocate"?**

This point is perhaps more of a question than an argument. I've picked up bits and pieces about your concept of reciprocity, which I personally find extremely agreeable. I've not yet seen a video where you go deeply into that subject, so it's possible I'm filling in the blanks incorrectly. I recently saw you argue that a zygote is covered by your concept of reciprocity merely by being human, and I can't help but feel a little bit lost by this conclusion. A zygote certainly has no brain, so are you affording it human rights merely *hoping* that it will one day be able to reciprocate? Personally, I would have thought that not even a small child is capable of moral reciprocity, and so I wouldn't find it philosophically hard to justify giving no moral consideration even to an infant. At least up until a certain age, which is pretty fuzzy and difficult to measure. Are there any of your videos in particular you might recommend that I watch in order to further understand this concept?

**Point 2: "Categorization fallacy"**

Categorization fallacy is a phrase I've just now coined for the sake of this argument, so you won't have any luck Googling it. Having said that, I feel that it must represent a known cognitive bias or fallacy, for which I simply do not know the name. Unfortunately for this reason I'll have to try and describe it myself before I can tie it back into my arguments against your position on abortion.

(see edit at the end of the post)

What I'm calling categorization fallacy is the human tendency to label, organize, and categorize things that lie on a continuum. This is perhaps nowhere clearer than in biology, where every animal is part of a specific family such as mammals, reptiles, avians, and so on. I'm assuming evolution is something you have at least a passable understanding of. Mammals evolved from reptiles, but they didn't do it overnight: there may have been millions of generations of creatures in between the time when a reptile first started to evolve hair and the time when we would call them mammals. Every single generation along the way would have been almost immeasurably different from the previous one, which makes it impossible to define a specific point when reptiles became mammals, and yet we agree that it definitely did happen somewhere along the way. Even today, the platypus and echidna represent living edge-cases where we have agreed to shoehorn a creature into the mammalian category despite it continuing to lay eggs.

I believe this fallacy applies obviously in society as well. Mentally, physically, and emotionally there's effectively no measurable difference between someone the day before and after their 18th birthday, and yet we have felt obliged as a society to arbitrarily decide that this is the distinction between a child and an adult, either as a matter of convenience or compulsion. 

I hope I've explained this concept well enough, because it's a pretty important part of my argument and I don't know that I have the philosophical expertise to properly define why it is a cognitive bias or a fallacy.

Bringing this back to the issue at hand, whilst there's no doubt that the act of being birthed is a logically arbitrary time to decide that something has become a human, I don't believe your definition is valid either. You've said it yourself that the reason you take this belief is because it's the only 'clear' and non-arbitrary moment we can point to, and you're not wrong, but I'd argue that the need to have a clear-cut moment to point to is a fallacy born of the human bias towards seeking discrete categories. In fact, I think the only philosophical positions that need to define a clear-cut moment of humanity are religious positions that seek to imbue us all with a soul.

If perhaps the most profound distinction between humans and the majority of the animal kingdom is self-awareness, I believe you could argue that modern studies suggest humans don't really begin to be human until 15-24 months after birth. It probably sounds absurd, but I think that you could reasonably argue that the morality of killing a one-year old child is roughly equivalent to that of killing a cat, or the cattle that we eat every day!

Pragmatically, I would argue that defining a child to be human at the moment of birth is logical. Not because the child undergoes a profound change in that moment, but because it's a moment that is very easy to mark, which many in society already agree with morally, and it is early enough that terminating one day before birth is still at no risk of harming anything that is self-aware. In short, it's a moment that's both convenient and safe.

**Point 3: A contrived thought experiment**

Once again visiting the notion that you become yourself at the moment of conception -- the idea being that you are your DNA -- perhaps you'll consider the following a contrived thought experiment. It may be real sooner than you think!

Natural conception occurs when a sperm fuses with an ova. Science produced its first cloned sheep in 1996, and though I don't believe it's been done, conceptually the same process could be used to produce human clones. If you're not familiar with the process, I believe the gist of it is that a donor ova has its nucleus removed and substituted with the nucleus of a cell from the animal to be cloned (but I'm no expert). When would a human conceived this way become a human, according to your position? The day the parent was conceived? The day the nucleus was swapped out? The day the clone zygote was implanted within a womb? I believe all three of these cases present their own edge-case issues that you're unlikely to be able to solve with a simple and clean definition.  

The day the parent was conceived? Maybe it's just me, but that seems somewhat absurd.  

The day the clone zygote was implanted within a womb? There's no physical difference between a zygote before or after the moment of implantation (to my knowledge at least), so your definition has now become a matter of convenience rather than objectivity.

The day the nucleus was swapped out? Well now you're no longer attaching your concept of humanity to the moment your DNA originated, but instead to the moment you first became a measurably distinct entity with a complete set of human DNA. This is probably the most tenable argument in my view, but it's still not perfect. Biologists today have been experimenting with processes that revert skin cells into embryonic stem cells, and if this could hypothetically be advanced to a point where a cell could be reverted back into a functional zygote, then you'd be capable of cloning someone without ever swapping out a cell nucleus. And you might think that's not a problem because it's still a measurably distinct entity, but I'm not so sure: a cell is not just distinct just because it's detached from the other cells around it (see blood cells or cancer cells). A baby produced this way could still be grown within the womb, but in my view would be philosophically similar to the budding that plants do, where the distinction between parent and child is not really possible to make for quite some time.

I hope you enjoyed this read as much as I enjoyed writing it.

**Edit**: I think the concept I'm trying to explain with this "categorization fallacy" concept is possibly an unusual application of the Continuum Fallacy, or the Sorites Paradox.Were feminists really to blame for the grid girls being banned, or was it just the world moving forward? I didn't see any large movements against grid girls prior to the ban and the whole thing seemed like a completely independent decision on Liberty Media's part because, to be honest, it's a bit of a silly tradition in the first place with no real future in sight. But now I see *everybody* screaming about feminists with regards to the situation and it seems to be because of a single woman's [(clearly)](https://twitter.com/rebeccageldard/status/958718387361861633) vitriolic tweets. Being a grid girl isn't a very large or permanent gig in the first place, and is typically done as a way to get started in the world of modeling. But please, feel free to discuss below and correct me where I'm wrong. :-)  
EDIT: Also, is the word 'ban' really accurate? Seems like Liberty just decided not to have them anymore since they don't align with the brand's values.These guys like Andy Warski, JF, and Braving Ruin are all fucking insufferable. They gossip just as much as they bitch about Destiny and others talking shit about them, and they're entirely disingenuous. Like Tonka saying he never called Destiny a pedophile, when he called him one like ten times in one stream. Then later in that stream, Andy straight out calls him a pedophile after saying "oh no, we meant that he has pedophilic tendencies". Like I said, I don't care for Destiny, but I've enjoyed reading this sub in the hopes that I can watch them all fall.

TL:DR I emailed Destiny because I would like to share my views on free will and determinism.

I already did a write up of my position in a comment, and it's possible what I have already done is more concise. If the text below looks too long, maybe just read the [original comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/7eu3i3/determinism_debate_with_chat/dq8tim5/) instead. 

He suggested that I make a new post, so I took the opportunity to try to expand on the first post a bit. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Chaos is a ladder", Little-finger, Chaos, Free Will, and Determinism:

What is really involved in the question of free will vs pure determinism?

Although it might be interesting to discuss the nature of consciousness and the mind as it relates to this question, at it’s fundamentals, the discussion does not start as a question of the mind. Pure determinism is a claim about causality, about time. How does the universe move from one moment to the next? Is the next moment completely determined by the previous one?

Physically, if time operates a certain way, in a completely deterministic way, then it seems like the debate is over before it started. It is very difficult to imagine that time and causality would operate one way in general, but would then later break the rules for conscious minds.

What I hope to do here is to frame the discussion in terms of time. How does time work? In order to think about time, I would suggest that we assume that time is something analogous to a computer, or at least a computation, moving the universe from one state to the next.

Therefore, with this analogy, we can speculate about the different ways the computer might work, and what implications that would have for the question of free will vs determinism.

I think the best two word description of the position I want to advocate, is “hard compatibilism”. I think the one state of the universe does cause the next, but if you look at the math involved with what this might look like, I don’t think it follows to say this process would precludes the possibility of free will.

So, there are some building blocks to getting to this position. The first one I have already covered, thinking of time as a computation.

The next is the idea of chaos. Chaos is a word that many people understand, but maybe fewer people know the scientific definition. For example, many people know that chaos is related to mess, or disorder, or “randomness” perhaps. That isn’t really what it means though. To say something is chaotic is not a claim about how messy it is, and it’s important to speak carefully when describing it as random, because that is only correct in a limited sense.

Saying something is chaotic is a claim about sensitivity and amplification. A good example is something like a Lorenz system. For example, you can run a Lorenz system on a computer, and follow a particle moving around in the system. Running these experiments, you will find that very small differences in starting position are amplified as the system runs.

You can use many many bits to get to get an extraordinarily tiny floating point difference between two points, and observe the system evolve for a long time. The two points might seem to follow an identical path, but it’s the nature of a chaotic system to amplify differences. That tiny tiny change is slowly bubbling up, and eventually the two paths will dramatically diverge.

As Littlefinger once said, “Chaos is a ladder”. What does that mean? It means that chaos is basically an opportunity for information to change scale. Something is chaotic when the state of a system at a microscopic level can climb the ladder and become macroscopic, relative to the system.

What does this mean for determinism? Well, basically it means it’s really hard. There are some processes that exist that are chaotic, and in any such system it’s basically guaranteed that minute things smaller than we can detect are being amplified and will change the outcome.

One good example is a lottery ping pong ball machine. I think I once asked my Dad if it was possible to predict who was going to win the lottery. Lottery ping pong balls are a great way to build an intuition about chaos, because the chaos comes from the shape of the balls, so he took the opportunity to explain how difficult that is.

Each time two balls collide any minute angular difference in position is transformed into a difference in trajectory. That means the further the ball travels after the collision, the more it amplifies the original difference.

Keep in mind as you continue to shake the box, they collide more than once. So this amplification is multiplied, and then that is multiplied, and it's exponentially amplified the more collisions there are. Like interest compounding.

Just shaking a box of ping pong balls will exponentially (or more) amplify the most minute possible differences in original position. So in order to properly describe the end result of something so sensitive, you need every input no matter how minuscule.

It was made clear to me that, to deterministically and accurately simulate the result of this kind of ping pong ball mill (or box), one would need to simulate the entire observable universe. Not every star as a point mass, every particle. Every particle has gravity, and if one particle changes position across the universe, if the mill was allowed to run for a long time, eventually that perturbation would climb the ladder and the result of the lottery mill would be completely different .

That at least, is what the math suggests would happen. 

So these are two building blocks to build the hard compatibilist position. One, time is a computer. Two, when we talk about one moment determining the next, we are talking about the entire universe, not some local area. Given that chaotic systems exist, it will not do much good to simulate one part of the universe but not the rest. You just won’t get the right answer, and even if your answer is close, it won’t be close forever, the differences just need to climb the ladder more.

Imagine you had some method of encoding everything into a number. The position of every atom, and all the details you need to know about the atoms. The observable universe is finite, so if you encoded the entire observable universe you would get some stupendously large finite number.

Entropy in the universe is increasing, so that means if you encode the next moment in time, you would get a larger number. Somewhere in that number, is the result you wanted to predict.
So, the question becomes, if you are in the universe represented by the first number, does the next number already exist?
A knee-jerk reaction might be to claim that it does, but keep in mind this number would be so massive it would be completely unobservable. No person or computer inside the first number would be able to store it in memory. No computation occurring inside the universe represented by the first number could produce the second number. To do so would be a paradox, because no number can contain a number larger than itself. 

Basically, what this means is that there are properties of the next moment in time that are unknowable, because that knowledge would result in a paradox. There will be something surprising occurring in each moment, because each moment cannot contain the next moment.

Here, I would like to clarify that I don’t think this has proved the existence of free will. The hard determinist side claims the entire states of the universe from one moment to the next is predetermined. The hard compatibilist claim is that something in the state of the universe from one moment to the next has an unknown origin, which doesn’t contradict the possibility of free will. Beyond that, it does nothing to suggest that free will exists.

It seems to me the hard determinist position is that this unknowable next number already exists in some platonic abstract sense, beyond the confines of our universe.

The hard compatibilist position is that this number does not yet exist inside or beyond our universe, and is created in “real time” so to speak.

It seems to me to be simpler and less mystical to imagine time is crawling along creating these numbers as it goes. It already has quite a job to to, so the hard compatibilist position makes sense to me.

The hard determinist position would say that all the numbers already exist as forms, and perhaps time is just a cursor passively progressing from one number to the next.

The thought experiment for me is as follows If you need to arrange 100 bricks in order, what is easier? Is it easier to walk along and place them down one at a time, or would it be easier to design and implement some monstrous 100 armed machine that would place them all at once?

Furthermore, for moments in time, which time machine would be simpler? Would it be easier to create an infinite amount of numbers all at once with some and store them or would it be easier to create each number in sequence?

Basically that is my point. I think an inductive understanding of numbers lends itself to an inductive understanding of time, and a compatibilist position on free will, and that seems to make sense to me.

Hard determinism seems to require this monstrous “infinite arms of creation” that sets up everything in advance, places all the bricks at the same time, and that boggles my mind so that doesn’t make sense to me.

Anyway, if you read that whole thing, thanks so much! This topic is something I have given a lot of thought, and it means a lot to me, and I really appreciate the chance to share my ideas.
I've seen some of his streams lately and he said he used to be pretty right-leaning just a couple of years ago actually. Supposedly, he had a very high scoring r/kotakuinaction post, as well as being an edgy gamer. I've heard rumours of him using the N-word (although I've also seen him deny it; and I can't say I've done any research on that matter).

What made him reconsider his stances?The roar of the cannons had subsided, but Oskar still couldn't make out the words of the man screaming in his face. Spittle and a crude germanic language rained from his mouth into the smoky air of the battlefield. He was Dutch and covered in blood and unhappy. He gestured towards the city.

Paris. The King, a gaunt and spasmatic man, had committed to shed every last drop of French blood to hold the capital. He'd paid that price, but still the great city swarmed with Italians, Poles and Serbs. Whatever the King might declare in one of his fits, there could be no victory now. The Portuguese had already signed a separate peace. The vast wealth of Holland was despoiled. The inevitable surrender would put an end to French ascendancy in the West.

As they were swept into a disorderly retreat from the city, Oskar found a Walloon to translate the Dutchman's ranting into a civilized language. Apparently, in the largest battle of this great war between Western and Central Europe, the French army had been leaderless. The renowned generals of France were nowhere to be found. It was a matter of some debate whether their absence resulted from wine, cowardice, or the warm comfort of a brothel.

Oskar suppressed a delighted smile at this news. Though he marched with France, this would be music to the ears of his true master - the King of Sweden. While others nations honed disciplined and organized armies, the Swedes had invested instead in espionage. Bloodied by their disastrous war against the Protestant League, they looked to shape events more discreetly in the future.

Perhaps, when the vast hordes of the Sultan flooded into Europe, they would regret investing in spies rather than soldiers.

   Destiny, it seems that every time socialism is brought up during one of your streams you simply dismiss it out of hand and say, “I am just a really big capitalist memer”. That approach to capitalism is clearly either a view born of ignorance or a disingenuous view of the current landscape. Capitalism has many flaws and they are becoming exceedingly clear to the general public at large and especially to millennials. The flaws and failures of capitalism are eating away at people’s everyday life and many people feel like the system has and will continue to either fail them or ignore them for their entire lives.


Part I: The Student Loans and Tuition Grift

	
   Higher education is supposed to be something that helps people better themselves ensuring that they are ready for the job market. College is supposed to be a haven to ensure that one lands a “good” job. College is often sold as not only the right choice, but often times as the *only* choice for many students who are supposedly planning out their future. However it seems that more often than not all college really does is help young people collect a large debt that can be held over their heads. [Student loan debt has also become the #1 debt held by Americans since 2010 with no indication of it slowing down.](http://assets.bwbx.io/images/ixm2PBIcfwGU/v1/-1x-1.jpg)


   College tuition has seen a consistent increase year after year as colleges claim that such fees are needed to offset declining taxpayer support at the state and federal levels. That claim has more or less been accepted by governing officials who oversee such changes. That was until investigation started to show that many public colleges had substantial reserves. One such study into the University of Wisconsin revealed that though the college had seen tuition increases of 5.5% per year since 2007 and an 18.7% increase in 2003; it had a reserve supply $648 million dollars with $414 million of that coming directly from tuition. This also isn’t to single out a single college. This is a problem that is happening around the entire country effecting **public** colleges. You know the institutions where you are supposed to be able to attend without incurring an unreasonable amount of debt. [University of Wisconsin tuition](http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/writers/mike_ivey/university-of-wisconsin-tuition-and-reserves-are-soaring-but-the/article_e7b10b2c-adf2-11e2-8726-0019bb2963f4.html) A final figure that really encapsulates the rising cost of tuition compares the amount of hours of minimum wage work needed to pay for a 4 year education at a public college. A Boomer would need 306 where a Millennial would need 4,459. The number really does speak for itself.

	
   Student Loans wouldn’t be the #1 debt held by Americans nor would it be the grift that is if it wasn’t for the [1998 Amendments to the Higher Education Act of 1965](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/leg/hea98/index.html) which reclassified student loans as nondischargeable debt. Basically meaning that they will never go away regardless of the situation. This is one of the primary reasons why it is so easy to get student loans regardless of the increase in tuition. There is no force to prevent lending as the price becomes larger and larger because whoever signs or co-signs the loan will be on the hook for life. Large companies like Goldman Sachs even got in on and have made quite the profit off it. This isn’t the only aspect of the grift, for there are many methods where one can “take advantage of” in order to repay their loans. If you ever begin to default on the loans you can go through a process called “rehabilitation” however that system often ends up with the debtor never paying a single cent against the principle. [Click here for some pretty horrifying stories about this version of debtors’ prison](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/taibbi-the-great-college-loan-swindle-w510880). It is truly remarkable to see how a system that was supposed to help people get ahead in life has transformed into a system that feeds off of those that enter it. As a generation leaves college and begins to live life with that debt it shouldn’t be too surprising to see them swarm towards Bernie’s idea of debt free college or to see why they aren’t seeing capitalism in a positive light.

Part II: The Gig Economy 


   The talk of jobs and the unemployment rate have been at a fever pitch since the 2008 recession hit. [With all signs since pointing to a positive trend of a decrease in the unemployment rate](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000) what does it mean for the people who now have these new jobs? Well, it seems like a sizable portion of those jobs are inside of the gig economy. [A new report from Intuit shows that the gig economy could be as large as 34% of the US workforce.](http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/24/news/economy/gig-economy-intuit/index.html) If that isn’t scary to anyone reading it that I don’t know what could be. The vast majority of those working inside of the gig economy do so as independent contracts and as you know, Destiny, that means writing a sizable check to the government each year in April to pay the taxes that aren’t automatically taken out of your paycheque. That can be a real surprise to many people who may have used their “extra” earnings on any sort of issue or accident that may have come up before they realized how much they actually owe. Another great bonus of being an independent contractor means you get no benefits and can be terminated at any time for virtually any reason, no questions asked. Though these are hardly the only issues that workers can succumb to while they work in the gig economy.  


   Almost all successful “gig economy” companies business model is one that is designed to avoid regulations and the cost that they include. Uber does so by avoiding the systems like the [medallion system](https://www.heritage.org/transportation/report/taxicab-medallion-systems-time-change) that was an essential tool used to regulate taxi’s in some large US cities. AirBnB is the exact same story, where their operational plan is to have a business that can functionally ignore all of the regulation of hotel industry. Which again is a very bad thing for the consumer if any problem were to arise; [for instance being a minority and looking for an AirBnB](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/travel/airbnb-discrimination-lawsuit.html). I mean Uber has had a constant issue with [sexual harassment all throughout the company.](https://www.recode.net/2017/12/6/16680602/susan-fowler-uber-engineer-recode-100-diversity-sexual-harassment) I mean I can easily find an almost bottomless pit containing [stories about how shitty the gig economy is for the workers.](https://www.thenation.com/article/this-is-how-bad-the-sharing-economy-is-for-workers/). Though this final example isn’t exactly a gig economy company it is one that shares the same kind of disregard for its employees as any other gig company does. That job being an Amazon warehouse worker. I don’t really think there is much of an explanation needed. Amazon warehouse workers have [limited time to sit](https://www.thestreet.com/story/14312539/1/amazon-warehouse-employees-discuss-grueling-work.html), [brutal conditions before the Christmas holidays](https://nypost.com/2017/11/28/amazon-workers-reveal-brutal-conditions-in-pre-christmas-rush/), to [timed toilet breaks and more insane demands](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/12/7-examples-how-amazon-treats-their-90000-warehouse.html). Again all of this should be another reason why an entire generation is looking at what capitalism has to offer and wondering if there is any other system out there that won’t abuse them to the same extent.


Part III: JPMorgan Chase and the 2008 Mortgage Crisis


   I am pretty sure that most people understand that the 2008 mortgage crisis and the ensuing bail out of the banks is a thing that happened and that it really didn’t do much to help the actual people who needed help. So I am not going to waste a lot of time going over it. However something that hasn’t seen a lot of reporting is **how** one bank, JPMorgan Chase, dealt with paying off what it owed to the government. JPMorgan Chase (JPMC) was on the line for two different issues. The first settlement was shared with 4 other banks and was a total of $25 Billion. The second settlement that involved Investor Fraud came to a grand total of $9 Billion, and JPMC was on the hook for all of that. Obviously not all of that was paid back to the government in actual cash, a large portion of it was paid back in “Consumer Relief” and this is where the real story starts. Consumer Relief is exactly what it sounds like. JPMC would either cut part of the balance that consumers owed, forgive the loan entirely, or adjust the terms so that they consumer could actually pay it off. JPMC would eventually reach about $8 Billion in consumer relief. One issue being is that a large amount of the $8 Billion of consumer relief that JPMC would claim were loans that were already bundled and sold. Meaning they would take credit for the relief while not actually being in possession of the loans. 


   This story really only came to light due to the due diligence of one man Larry Schneider who was massively ripped off by JPMC. He was originally sold a large bundle (35,000) loans that were supposable worth $156 million. He ended up only paying a tenth of a penny on the dollar for the bundle. With limited borrower information (address/phone number) he starts to go over the loans and set up a payment plan with the borrowers that they could actually afford. Considering the sweetheart deal he got in regards to purchasing the loans he would be able to slash away a lot of each loan and still make his money back and more. Meanwhile as he was trying to collect from the loans JPMC never stopped trying to collect from any of the loans that they had sold to him. JPMC didn’t even actually do this behind his back either, they are pretty upfront about it to his face when he asked. JPMC actually had multiple different revenue streams coming in from these loans after they sold them to Schneider, and when they were able to start the consumer relief payments they started to claim these loans for that purpose too. Meaning that after several years of some borrowers paying Schneider they would receive a letter in the mail from JPMC saying that their loan was forgiven. Obviously that lead to a lot of confusion for the borrower and for Schneider. 


   The story goes on from there and to make it even weirder the story also rubs up against the church of scientology. It also includes Jamie Dimon personally. He got involved because JPMC was going to send out mass forgiveness of loans to the city of Detroit, but Dimon was about to announce a large investment into the city and didn’t want the negative press to outweigh the positive press. So, he simply delayed the process. The issue with mass forgiveness of loans is that if there is no one living in the house that is forgiven the city is required to take care of the houses maintenance. So it would decrease tax revenues while simultaneously increasing costs to the city. It was known by JPMC and the US government what effect mass forgiveness of loans has upon the houses and the areas market, yet JPMC did it anyways. A few more funny aspects of this story deals with old retired judges coming out of retirement in order to oversee loan processing where the loans were often backdated. However the judges didn’t really have much on an interest since they trusted that the bank was doing the right thing. There was also a woman named Linda Green who became a VP of JPMC among multiple other companies so that other people would have an easy name to sign. I could continue, but you really should just listen to this. 


   As a final note, they only real bank that was indicted for any wrong doing for the 2008 mortgage crisis was a small bank called Abacus. It was a family run bank that primarily loaned money out to the NYC Chinatown community. What makes the story even more macabre is that were indicted for a fraud that they reported to the regulatory board. It really is quite the fucked up story. The banks story was made into a documentary that was nominated for an Oscar. 


   Again, similar to the previous parts it seems like capitalism cares more about the large companies than it does to the worker or home owner. The system seems to indicate that banks can fuck around and gamble all they want and when time comes to pay up they hand the bucket to someone else down the line.

Part IV: The Housing Crawl


   There is often the view that is associated with millennials being that they are killing X industry. Often times that idea is just a really simplified view of the issue. Most of the time millennials just like most people want to take part in industry X, however they often see themselves priced out of the market for it entirely. One such industry being housing, a new report shows that [80% of millennials actually want to buy a house, however they really can’t afford it](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/26/most-millennials-want-to-buy-a-home-but-about-half-have-nothing-saved.html). I really wonder where that [statistic may tie in](https://twitter.com/SophiaHelwani/status/957304540201672709) to previous things discussed in this post? It seems that when someone already has significant debt obligations lines of credit won’t be readily available for them to make large purchases. 


   On top of that many large cities are facing housing crisis. Each housing crisis is slightly different to each other but they all share a common thread. That being apartments are being purchased as a way for people to store money or build equity. [London, England](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/london-struggles-with-ghost-mansions-and-zombie-flats-the-empty-units-in-city-bereft-of-affordable-housing/2017/09/18/253d67fa-97c4-11e7-af6a-6555caaeb8dc_story.html?utm_term=.297fd74bb454) and [Vancouver, Canada](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/struggling-with-the-cost-of-rent-it-s-not-just-vancouver-1.4397508) are both facing those sort of problems. This is just another issue that can spill over into other areas. If people aren’t able to acquire affordable housing near their job they may have to either move and find a new job or more likely move and commute to their job. 


   I could go on at lengths about all the different zoning issues and how local governments are either ignoring or trying to tackle those issues, but that would make this post even longer. 


Part V: Capitalism Fails at much much more!


   Destiny, if you want to have a conversation about this I am sure we could also touch on the any of the following topics and I am sure I could convince you capitalism is terrible for the following industries.

* Retail
* Healthcare
* Transportation

Sup guys, I was looking for anything that isn't PragerU, that makes good arguments for capitalism. As for me personally, I very much like the idea of Socialism, and look up to economist like Richard D. Wolff. But I have recently moved closer to the idea of a mixed economy. Anyway thanks!For me, it's shroud.Destiny was confused about why "some full time employees are secret service special agents" does not mean there are also some full time employees who are NOT secret service special agents.

Yet when you take another example you can see clearly why this is:

For example.

All snow is white.

Some snow is white.

Both propositions can be true.

And thus when you make a particular affirmative statement the universal affirmative statement can still be true.

So it could be that "some full time employees are secret service special agents" and "all full time employees are secret service special agents" are both true.

Or, you could imagine a collection of twenty apples. All of the apples are red. Does acknowledging some of the apples are red automatically mean that not all of them are red? Not necessarily when you think about it.seriously, you guys are huge faggots.Twitter Hello, Thank you for contacting us about this issue.

Edit: I thought this post by destiny was about him maybe getting his account back. Didn't read it carefully. RIP.For those of you who don't know the White House declassified and released the Nunes memo today(2/2/18). The memo was rumored to show a bias against Trump in the FBI and DOJ. I'll try and give a general overview of how things went down(chronologically) and later explain why this is very troubling news with potentially serious consequences.

Long story short, there are 3 separate investigations into the Trump-Russia scandal: the Senate intel committee; the House intel committee; the Muller probe. Devin Nunes is the House Intelligence Committee chairman thus granting him authority over the other members. Of the 3 investigations, the house intel committee has been the biggest shitshow; leading to moments like Nunes himself discussing and sharing information on the committee's findings with White House personnel.( https://www.wired.com/2017/04/devin-nunes-white-house-trump-surveillance/ ) Now fast forward to this week, Nunes is claiming to have uncovered a heavy anti-Trump bias in the FBI(insert "deep state" memes here) during the investigation the House intel committee has been leading. The Democrats are saying that the memo is purposefully misconstrued to sew doubts about the impartiality of the FBI and subsequently their investigation of the Trump administration. They even wrote their own rebuttal memo which ironically got suppressed by Nunes and the Reupblicans in the House intel committee.( https://www.npr.org/2018/01/29/581718405/intel-committee-votes-to-release-secret-gop-memo-withhold-democrats-rebuttal ) Not only did the Democrats believe that the Nunes memo was meant to tarnish the FBI but so did the FBI and DOJ. ( http://www.businessinsider.com/fbi-warns-against-releasing-devin-nunes-memo-2018-1) Also, let's not forget that both Chris Wray, FBI director, and Rod Rosenstein, deputy AG, were both appointed by Trump. Now that the basics have been covered we can move on to the memo itself.

The Nunes memo is only 4 pages long but here are its key claims. ( https://www.vox.com/2018/2/2/16957588/nunes-memo-released-full-text-read-pdf-declassified )

&gt;he FBI used an unverified, allegedly biased document known as the “Steele dossier” to get a warrant in October 2016 to surveil Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser. The dossier, prepared by former British spy Christopher Steele, alleges the existence of a conspiracy between Donald Trump and the Russian government. The Steele dossier was partially financed by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) — which the memo argues is a major problem.

&gt;Senior FBI and Justice Department officials knew that the Steele dossier was indirectly funded by a lawyer for the Clinton campaign and the DNC, but didn’t disclose this in their application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court — a court that approves surveillance warrants pertaining to national security and foreign intelligence. They also didn’t disclose it when renewing their applications requesting additional time for surveillance.


&gt;In September 2016, Steele spoke with Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr. Steele told Ohr that he “was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.” Ohr’s wife worked for the research firm, Fusion GPS, that hired Steele on behalf of the DNC/Clinton lawyer.

&gt;The head of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division Bill Priestap apparently said corroboration of the Steele dossier was in its “infancy” at the time of the FISA application.

The big claim that Nunes is making is that the FBI knew and didn't disclose that they were using "false" and biased information (the Steele Dossier) when applying for surveillance warrants through the FISA court on Trump officials(Carter Page). First of all the Steele dossier has still not been proven or disproven but more importantly it's to note that the FISA APPLICATIONS are the KEY part to what Nunes is claiming. Now the main problem here is that Devin Nunes DID NOT READ THE FUCKING FISA APPLICATIONS. ( https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/02/03/devin-nunes-fox-gop-memo-sot-erin.cnn/video/playlists/top-news-videos/ ) Did you catch who did read the FISA applications? Our good friend Trey Gowdy, remember him? (https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-endless-trial-of-trey-gowdys-benghazi-committee-20160114) How did Trey Gowdy react to the news of the Nunes memo? Being the hack that he is he didn't completely shit on his fellow congressman by stating quasi-concerns over the FISA application process but ultimately admitting "The contents of this memo do not — in any way — discredit his investigation.” ( https://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/gowdy-contents-memo-dont-discredit-mueller ) Not only do we have Gowdy, the person who actually read the FISA application discrediting the Nunes memo; there also seems to be sources from the NYT, WaPo &amp; WSJ indicating that the FBI did disclose that the Steele dossier was from a political entity. (https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/959641575742758913 ) So that's the whole controversy behind the Nunes memo and it was rather easy to debunk as partisan hackery at it worst. Unfortunately, this memo might have some lasting consequences and ultimately it did its job.

I believe the whole point of the White House releasing this memo was to undermine the Muller investigation and ultimately (whether the memo was true or not) to replace deputy AG Rod Rosenstein with a Trump loyalist who would fire Muller, given that Sessions has "recused" himself. This is another example of the Trump administration attacking our democratic institutions in order to bend them to his will and its not looking good. If anyone has already forgotten Trump has already hollowed out the EPA and filled it with oil lobbyists among a myriad of other things he has done. As Historian Timothy Synder says ""It’s pretty much inevitable” that Trump will try to stage a coup and overthrow democracy." ( https://www.salon.com/2017/05/01/historian-timothy-snyder-its-pretty-much-inevitable-that-trump-will-try-to-stage-a-coup-and-overthrow-democracy/ ) I find this to be particularly disturbing because of what i'm hearing on shows like the morning kumite and the Warski show. Practically everyone on the show was spreading misinformation while being utterly convinced the memo completely exonerated Trump. All of them: Andy Warksi; CRP; Braving Ruin; Styx666; Tonkasaw; Sinatra; Nick Fuentes; Mike Enoch; JF; believed it. Ironically it seemed like Tonka was the most critical of the memo but regardless they are spreading misinformation all over their communities because they're all too fucking stupid to do simple google searches. Let's face it, Trump is ballsy enough to try and undermine the probe given any chance he can and he's really trying to sway public opinion on the FBI so he can. Because at this point it doesn't even matter if Trump did/didn't colluded with Russia, he doesn't want Muller anywhere near his finances. After all there must have been some reason for Trump to be hiding his tax returns to this very day. Let's hope we don't wake up to some sort of Nixon-esque Saturday Night Massacre during the Superbowl tomorrow when lot's of people will be distracted by the game.

I hope this helps answer any questions people might have had on the Nunes memo. Let me know if I've got anything wrong or if i'm misrepresenting anything or if my sources suck.

edit: Here is another video of Trey Gowdy, the only person to have read the FISA application, discrediting the Nunes memo ( https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/04/politics/trey-gowdy-memo/index.html ). 

TL;DR: Nunes memo is bullshit, Trump is still winning

He doesn't have the production values of Mouthy Buddha, he doesn't have the academic credentials of JF and Jordan Peterson nor does he have a pandering Rap-And-Twitch career like Baked Alaska. He doesn't even have a British accent!

All he did was sit in the camera and spout bullshit, but anyone can do that! And I look at his older videos, and he was previously a left-wing Satanist who hated Sarah Palin and posted classical rock music on YT.

So why did he gain fame in the first place?WHERE IS OUR MONDAY MAIL??? REEEEEEEEEEEEThe last couple of weeks, a random memer has been donating to Destiny hyping up how the Memo would bring the Democrat party to it's knees.

Can we have him on to listen to him twist things about so that it actually contained anything relevant?Has he said anything about it? I know he's contacted them and that's about it. I feel like he won't be getting it back. Any alternatives he has considered?I don't know the context of why people started discussing it but there seemed to be some confusion over how claims can be evaluated logically. In philosophy there's a concept called the square of opposition. Basically all claims fall somewhere on two axes: Universal/Existential and Affirmative/Negative. We can draw this out as a table:

A (universal affirmative)    E (universal negative)

I (existential affirmative)   O (existential negative)

The top being universal, the bottom being existential, left being affirmative and right being negative. We write these claims as "(Some/All) S (is/is not) P". And depending on the truth value of a particular claim we can make certain extrapolations.

Contrary: A/E are contrary meaning they both cannot be true but they both can be false.

Contradictory: A/O and E/I are contradictory, meaning that they have the opposite truth value.

Subcontrary: I/O are subcontrary meaning that they both can be true but they both cannot be false.

Subalterns:A/I and E/O are subalterns meaning that if A or E is true, I or O must also be true, and if I or O is false, A or E must also be false.

Basically if you run into a situation like this it may be helpful to draw up one of these tables and place each claim at the appropriate point. remember that a true universal claim or a false existential claim can be used to extrapolate the truth value of the rest of the claims.This whole thing is so autistic and I'm sick of hearing about it at this point I'm almost convinced Tonka is sticking to his narritive not because he thinks it's true but because he just doesn't like Destiny and he knows that if he can make this stick it'll be really harmful to him.

That someone with this track record, and in such desperate circumstances, managed to become manager of a Republican presidential campaign tells you a lot about why American politics and institutions are in dire straits.
where is that located?What ever happened with thisMany of his points about them I saw myself months back, and was really disgusted at what many of these people I subscribed to had become. Many of them I've dumped because their nutcase racialist views and others because they were pretending to be something they weren't. Some I'm still subscribed to, I haven't clicked on their videos because I cant stand for people advocating some really evil shit, and expecting me to support them because we agree on some more mainstream political issues.

I searched for ANYONE on YT that actually managed to talk back to these guys, and not apologize for it because they were afraid of some mass-downvote on their videos. Destiny was the first I found, and I've binged HOURS of his streams. Seeing people I used to trust, espouse ideology that they would roast the left for, was embarrassing, and infuriating. All Destiny had to do was *GASP* ask some questions. Something the Skeptics seems unable to ever do seriously.

So, thanks!
I want to do something similar but with rare pepes instead. I know it has something to do with custom APIs but that shit is beyond me fam. Can someone walk me through it?

Please senpai, embrace the DSP route and start vlogging.Hi I'd like to be austiciI used to follow the Skeptic Community nearly 10 years ago, when the conversation on YouTube was more about atheism and Christianity. In recent years, I found the Skeptic's conversation move more towards anti-SJW videos, criticism of the Left, and "muh free speech." I started seeing questionable figures like Lauren Southern, Milo, and Paul Joseph Watson associate with the Skeptic community. I saw a more "right-leaning" internet culture arise -- esp. on reddit and YouTube, and I rarely if ever saw a Skeptic YouTuber stray from criticizing left-leaning figures, despite "disagreeing with Trump and the Right."

I think the video that sealed the deal with me from the Skeptic community was Thunderf00t's video on Lauren Southern's dishonest journalism --- where she associates the "anti-Trump" movement with a destructive anarchist protest. I found Thunderf00t's points valid, but many in the Skeptic community -- including AndyWarski and Chris Ray Gun jumped to defend Southern. Thunderf00t got tons of blow-back from that video as well. Shortly after, I discovered Destiny through his debate with JonTron, and he won me over.

How did you discover Destiny, and what won you over? I feel that critics of the Skeptic community are the vast minority in this conversation -- what do you think? I haven't quite found many other Skeptic Critics other than ContraPoints, and hbomberguy. A machete attack on a LGBT pride event was thwarted after the alleged attacker told people about his plan on Facebook, a court has heard.

Ethan Stables, 20, had assembled a machete, knives, an axe, an air rifle and a ball bearing gun in preparation for an attack on the New Empire pub in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria on 23 June last year, prosecutors told Leeds crown court on Tuesday.

Stables was foiled after he told members of a Facebook group about his plot to attack the LGBT pride event last summer and a member phoned the police and posted a warning on Twitter.

The defendant was arrested close to the pub on the evening of the event on a final reconnaissance visit, planning to return later that night to carry out the attack, the jury heard.

Jonathan Sandiford, the prosecutor, said Stables was a “white supremacist and nazi – a supporter of Adolf Hitler, if you will” and “had a deep-seated hatred of black, Jewish, Muslim and especially gay people”.

He added: “Between 2016 and his arrest in 2017, he was planning and preparing to commit acts of terrorism directed towards members of these groups but, primarily, directed towards people who were lesbian or gay.” 

The prosecutor told the jury of seven men and five women how Stables became enraged when he heard about the event at the New Empire pub. 

Stables spent seven months researching firearms and explosives, and had begun to acquire material to build an improvised explosive device, the jury heard. 

“His purpose in these acts of preparation was to launch a murderous attack on members of these communities. In particular, the prosecution suggest, people who were gay,” the prosector said.

Patrick Upward QC, who is defending Stables, told the jury that his client was not a white supremacist, but more a “white fantasist”.

Upward agreed the material outlined by the prosecution was an “awful, disgusting, vile series of posts”, but said the defendant had a long history of dealing with Asperger’s syndrome, had a favourite uncle who is openly gay and a black best friend.

The trial continues.

43 min in they discuss a lot of what destiny (not directly) does regarding engagement with the skeptics/racists/uninformed crowd. There are questions that people in these communities are never asked or ideas that they haven’t sought out and discourse is really needed now a days. Decent discussion How does it feel defending someone who actively defends “ethical child porn”, and who was shown by Sargon to be the intellectual charlatan that he is.Found some nice memes. Andy and JF are going full anti-muslim/immigration/brown people now, no brakes.

[Enjoy](https://youtu.be/gtGqIg2TOUM?t=37m49s)Over 13 hours of Nier this week, for those interested in that, and a lot of discussions as well. So here's this weeks spreadsheet, just a couple things before you ask.

1. % of total time is &gt;100% because of overlap of multiple things (discussions while playing games for example)
2. If you want to sort the columns, click file&gt;download as and download the spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JCLGFzExKT5X6Xf_UQSQVQ2b1apyDKO30RDYgoikbZQ/

Also, Hillshire has put together an awesome site related to the spreadsheet here https://infinite-cliffs-94665.herokuapp.com/ You can sort by category/topic and there are links to timestamps for everything. Also, Hillshire added a new feature this week that is really useful, you can now hit "next part" at the bottom of the video to skip sections without having to scroll down. The site searches for my post every 3 hours so this weeks spreadsheet should be on there within 3 hours from this post.I remember destiny talked some time ago how renting is better vs buying house.
Today i saw video of reckful explaining the same thing that renting is better almost always:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpcMl9XP55M

I don't know much about whole renting stuff, so I would like to know if that is corrrect what Reckful was saying? Maybe even Destiny could explain more in depth on stream.

Thank you.I think this is my first post on this sub so here is some pretext. I've been watching Destiny for around 2 years and JP for less than 1 (sometime after the trans drama) I'm just curious as to what you guys disagree with him on.
I just heard that Bitcoin is plummeting in price like Wall Street in 1929.

What happened? Did the bubble burst?

And now the important question:
Will graphics card prices finally drop?Not sure how complete this list is but the wiki lists 19 Twitter permbans.  I'm too lazy but does someone want to add Steven Kenneth Bonnell II with unknown ban length.Have I missed a statement saying the time investment into bio lectures for alt-right debate prep is done?  Destiny just commented as to how lefties never give legitimate criticisms of capitalism on his subreddit. Let's see how spergy I get.

Definitions:  
0. Resources - Capital, labor, and natural resources.  
1. Capitalism - an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state.  
2. Socialism - a political and economic theory of social organization that advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.  
3. Market - an area or arena in which commercial dealings are conducted.*  

\* This definition further extends to mean the standard economic interaction within and amongst the participants in in a market economy. 

Assumptions:  
1. The goal of an economy is the efficient allocation of resources to a societies problems, goals, needs, and wants.  
2. In this discussion, a criticism of markets is considered a valid criticism of capitalism.*  
3. We are discussing the real world application of socialist and capitalist economies, not the theoretical pure versions of either.  
3a. This implies that "socialist" economies are economies such as those found in Western Europe. France can be used as a modeled example.  
3b. This implies that "capitalist" economies are economies such as those found in the United States, particularly the economy advocated for by the Libertarian party within the United States' political system.  

\* This is contentious, I'm sure. The two are distinct, but generally criticisms of capitalism are actually criticisms of markets levied at the easier to identify with term. 

Can this set of definitions and assumptions be agreed on? If not, what needs to be amended?When Destiny-Senpai says "Hakai" [Here](https://youtu.be/WATel2mjlbY?t=3m16s) and dub it over Toppo whenever he says "Hakai" in the recent Dragon Ball Super episodes? Pleasessssssss, I can give you a reddit silver!!!Recently destiny mentioned that in the past he brought on Ben Spurr off of twitter because he was talking shit and ended up crying because he had too much diarrhea. Does anyone know where to watch this? that hbomberguy will make "le mesaured repsonse" video of jordan peterson, in his usual smug manner, which will be posted to this sub and be one of the top posts of the month, and then everyone here will start copy pasting arguments from that video against peterson regardless of truth. Eh, no reason. Just curious.Having a convo with him in like 12 hours, any suggestions on topics or questions for him? If you have something specific, please source it.Hey folks, I want to know if I've got destiny's angles right and I figured I'd ask you guys if I have this right because you've definitely seen a lot more of him than I have.


Incest:
My understanding is that he's doing the same thing you can do with killing. 

You can ask yourself: is killing wrong? Your reflex might be to say yes, but upon further thought you get to consideration of killing animals for food, killing bacteria if you want to go further. You also get to self defense or whether wars can be justified. You can dig in and argue that killing itself isn't necessarily wrong, but the scenarios that come to mind when you bring up the question (e.g. murder) make you immediately jump to "killing's bad".

These sort of thoughts aren't so uncommon; killing isn't so taboo, and destiny's picked a more controversial example.

About right?


"Ethical CP":
My understanding is that he's mostly considering a thought experiment that boils down to "would you rather stop pedophiles from having child pornography in a controlled situation where it's proven to prevent harm, or allow it and stop more children from being molested?"

About right?Hello I remember seeing you were having a “soyboy” debate a couple of weeks ago or so and i just finished researching soy recently and I found some papers that were really interesting, theres a lack of studies on the subject with a clear cut answer, it all requires quite a bit additional digging, but from what I understand is the wording in the studies are extremely important many of the studies stated soy does not raise estrogen but also state:

“Soy isoflavones are known to have weak estrogenic or hormone-like activity due to their structural similarity with 17-β-estradiol (Figure 3). Estrogens are signaling molecules that exert their effects by binding to estrogen receptors within cells (Figure 3). The estrogen-receptor complex interacts with DNA to change the expression of estrogen-responsive genes. Estrogen receptors (ER) are present in numerous tissues other than those associated with reproduction, including bone, liver, heart, and brain (7).”

“Soy isoflavones and their metabolites also have biological activities that are unrelated to their interactions with estrogen receptors (9). By inhibiting the synthesis and activity of certain enzymes involved in estrogen metabolism, soy isoflavones may alter the biological activity of endogenous estrogens and androgens (10-13)”

(http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/soy-isoflavones) you should read this paper, it uses 199 studies as references in a short detailed report

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4270274/

they use this wording in a very unclear way, you can find studies saying soy does not increase estrogen but soy isoflavones do change estrogen metabolism and increases retention and that is not a debated fact as far as I am aware so it does raise estrogen by preventing your body from getting rid of it From what I understand.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10952094
"consumption of 65 or 132 mg isoflavones decreased excretion of 4-(OH) estrone"

I also seen a Harvard study on sperm, I don’t know if you guys covered this topic of sperm count and subfertility (Harvard website requires a logon but I took a screenshot for you of the web page https://gyazo.com/a3e6806362a4f0fab1047f8fd76bc632 )
https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/Medical-memo-Soy-and-sperm
I'm wondering if everyone just realizes this, but isn't saying it because Fox was dreadfully insignificant in the larger picture.

Scrolling back, it looks like Fox tried to pull a Destiny and go hard after JF, and was made to look foolish.  Funny how bullies cave to bullying, but Destiny didn't.  

By the way, I've become a regular listener to Destiny's streams after he continues to slap these alt righters around like children.  I sense on the down low, there may be a growing respect between Destiny and Metokur, now that the latter has backed away from some of his alt right positions.  

Hell, to bring this full circle, in the last stream, even "Failure"/"Johnny Fox" was asking Destiny about articles and his opinion on things.  Then he apologized to Tonka for doing so!  Idiots.
Love that game and I never got to see the stream where he played it :(Is there anyway to get Destiny's attention to this?

https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/5/16964202/heroes-of-the-storm-voice-chat-blizzard

I'm really curious what he thinks, because myself and him both REALLY want voice chat in MOBA games and think it's ridiculous to not have it.That said, I wish Destiny had let him speak more, it really became Destiny just venting with him about his last few months "debating" the anti-SJWs, like Dr Layman is his therapist. 

Don't get me wrong, it sounds like the guy really needed it, but I was hoping they would get to the nitty gritty of their arguments, since, having watched Layman's videos, I think they agree in general points but not in the details, and that would've been fun. He should bill Destiny after this stream for leading questions and letting him vent off the last year and a half of talking to retards and playing League.I’ve got him yelling EEDIOT stuck in my head. Does anyone have a passionate clip of him saying it for me to meme around? A Nice quote I think I'll hold onto for a while! https://clips.twitch.tv/GlutenFreeZealousHerbsEagleEyeIf any Germans know him personally, please post below.

For skeptics: This post is completely 100% real and not ironic in any way. Please screencap this and direct your legal issues to George Soros. Thanks my dudeThe only one I can think right now is maybe Mister Metokur.I don't think Destiny has been entirely fair in his evaluation of TheAmazingAtheist/TJ Kirk. It's true he does make a lot of anti-SJW videos, but I think he has a relatively nuanced worldview. I don't think he fell into the alt-right black hole and I think talking to him would be productive. He dislikes Jordan Peterson; I heard he is currently making a negative video about him. He once lost it on the stream when they were watching a Ben Shapiro video and called him a snowflake. Economically I think he might be a bit more towards socialist than Destiny, but he doesn't advocate abolition of capitalism or anything afaik. He is openly critical of Trump. Overall I think the issues he looked into he is rational about, and for the other issues he is just too lazy to do so.https://twitter.com/PSRealTalk/status/961229976472301568?ref_src=twcamp%5Ecopy%7Ctwsrc%5Eandroid%7Ctwgr%5Ecopy%7Ctwcon%5E7090%7Ctwterm%5E0


Apologies for any formatting or lack of necessary flair - on mobile. See above. What are others' perceptions of Sargon?I have been sucked into the larvae lounge. I did not care for Destiny when I first came here, but now I can't look away when he's streaming. What is wrong with me?Matthew Heimbach is coming to my university for a lecture, and I'm just curious about some of his speaking points and arguments. I'll probably attend the event, and I'd like to be prepared for any "discussions" that I may get into. (But tbh the whole thing will probably end up being a screaming match between the left and the right). a few days ago i saw a tweet by a septic saying, ["look at these 31 silly genders nyc recognizes, this is so ridiculous!"](https://twitter.com/JaclynGlenn/status/957787609295548416) in my feed, it seemed like an obvious bullshit anti-sjw talking point, i decided to investigate, and, spoilers, it turned out to be a bullshit anti-sjw talking point. and then i remembered that at least twice during a debate his opponent brought it up, and destiny said nothing, so i thought i'd share my findings here

as far as i can tell, the only publications that reported this news (at least as "nyc recognizes 31 genders!!1") are right wing fake news spewing anuses like daily caller and federalist papers, and the only source their articles cite is this [information brochure](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/cchr/downloads/pdf/publications/GenderID_Card2015.pdf) produced by the nyc commission on human rights. as you can see, nowhere does it say "these are the 31 officially recognized genders", this appears to be a list of basic gender identity and gender expression related terms, [and it seems like most of the people who covered this news could really use reading it](http://dailycaller.com/2016/05/24/new-york-city-lets-you-choose-from-31-different-gender-identities/) since most of them use the terms "gender" and "gender identity" interchangeably

[the 2015 update to nyc's human rights law](http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/961-15/nyc-commission-human-rights-strong-protections-city-s-transgender-gender) is what actually set off all that screeching on the right, and it's just as much of a non-issue as bill c-16: its purpose was to clarify what constitutes gender identity discrimination, which had already been illegal in nyc since 2002, that's itIs Gary going to upload the whole Nier Let's Play? I'd like to watch some parts that I missed but going through the VODs is a hassle and they will be removed after 60 days :(So I wrote this somewhat long email to Destiny, and I thought maybe this sub would be interested in reading it aswell, so here it is:

Hey buddy,

just a heads-up on the AfD, you shouldn't let people like Layman get away with tacitly supporting them. It is very similiar to how people supported Trump because he was a "non-interventionist".
Here are a few scandals the AfD has had recently, not all since that would be impossibly long to list.


1. Alice Weidel one of the two leaders of the AfD in the Bundestag wrote a racist email that revealed some pretty troubling ideas. Not only does she believe the democratic government of germany is illigitemate and only a puppet of the WW2 allied powers, but also that it is tasked with basically white genocide (but just on a german level). She at first denied this email being hers but had to stop doing that or lie under oath, so she stopped. [1]
    

1. The other one of the two leaders, Gauland, recently cried out for the right of germans to feel pride about "achievements of german soldiers during two World Wars". This is pretty troubling since the Wehrmacht was often responsible for mass slaughter of civilians in an eradication campaign to kill as many "subhumans" as possible, aswell as a multitude of other war crimes. Lies about the Wehrmacht being just soldiers and only the SS beeing bad are common amongst the far right (see "clean wehrmacht"), but it is pretty troubling for a top politician to repeat neo-nazi propaganda. [2]
   

1.  Gauland, also said that Germans simply would not want to live next to "a Boateng". Boateng is one of germany's top football players, a millionaire, has no criminal record and just so happens to be black. It is pretty obvious why Gauland thinks germans don't want him as their neighbour. [3]
   

1.  Another influential figure within the AfD Björn (Bernd) Höcke called the Holocaust memorial a "monument of shame" that "no other people would put in their capitol". [4] He also called for "1000 years of german history and 1000 years of future for germany", an obvious reference to the 1000 year Reich Hitler had named "his germany", called for germans to focus on the positive parts of our history including the third Reich and ignore the not so nice aspects. He also mentioned how Africans inherently follow a different reproductive strategy than whites (r/K selection theory). The AfD for a while pretended to want to get rid of him, but that stopped after the election. He has a huge following within the right wing of that far right party. [5]
   

1.  On the topic of excluding members of the party, one prominent member Gedeon has written quite a few antisemtic books in his past, and again for a while the party pretended to want to get rid of him, later they concluded that they would not, here is a translation of their reasoning [6]:
  
  "Gedeon had also written his books in some cases long before the founding of the AfD, so he could not have violated party principles at all. Gedeon however has maintained his position [on anti-semitism], to this day. This, however, could 'not be reproached', the arbitral tribunal finds: Because to not abandon an old position is not "doing", but "doing nothing"- and only damaging "doing" makes exclusion possible."


These are only a couple of the countless scandals, there have been many others such as high ranking member von Storch calling for the shooting of refuggees at the border on Twitter and later stating she missclicked with her mouse as her apology. Or a lot of members having close ties to the german Neo-Nazi scene, or recently members sending pictures of SS marching into private AfD chats. Or the fact that the party completely denies climate change beeing a thing, the only german party to do so. Clearly Layman's claim on Twitter [7] that most members are just oldschool rightwing, when so many problems concerning the extremist right have come up, including statements and emails by the two official leaders in the Bundestag Weidel and Gauland, is either willfully ignorant or intentionall misleading.


Also his statement about German foreign politics beeing super hawkish is kinda unfounded, the SPD pushed for us to ignore the NATO 2% rule on military budget and famously opposed the Iraq war while the CDU wanted us to join, they just got the CDU/CSU to put a new limit on weapons export no longer exporting to any parties involved in Yemen amongst other things, they are no angels but they do not fit the criteria of beeing hawkish. There is also always a super non-interventionist leftwing option in Die LINKE that even wants to leave NATO to not get dragged into another Afghanistan by the US and stop doing UN missions that involve combat, and unlike AfD beeing non-interventionist is a big part of their party platform not just some afterthought they never even mention. So if beeing non-interventionist is "literally the only I was even remotely kinda interested in"[8], then why wouldn't he vote for that also anti-establishment party and not the party with the Nazi ties and problematic statements.


All in all I hope after reading this you aggree that just like with Trump saying "they won't get involved in Syria" is not nearly enough, you would've never let that excuse work as the reason to vote for him over Hillary and it cannot under any circumstance be enough for a party as problematic as the AfD.

Best regards,

Arvendilin

[8] https://www.twitch.tv/videos/226421040?t=03h19m52sAt one point (sorry don't have timestamp) during his conversation with Dr Layman, Destiny brought up the Backfire Effect (though he didn't name it).  

"The backfire effect is a name for the finding that, given evidence against their beliefs, people can reject the evidence and believe even more strongly. " https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias#Polarization_of_opinion  

However, word on the street is that the existence of the Backfire Effect is now in question.  

"Abstract"  
"Can citizens heed factual information, even when such information challenges their partisan and ideological attachments? The “backfire effect,” described by Nyhan and Reifler (2010), says no: rather than simply ignoring factual information, presenting respondents with facts can compound their ignorance. In their study, conservatives presented with factual information about the absence of Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq became more convinced that such weapons had been found. The present paper presents results from five experiments in which we enrolled more than 10,100 subjects and tested 52 issues of potential backfire. Across all experiments, we found no corrections capable of triggering backfire, despite testing precisely the kinds of polarized issues where backfire should be expected. Evidence of factual backfire is far more tenuous than prior research suggests. By and large, citizens heed factual information, even when such information challenges their ideological commitments."   
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2819073  

There are criticisms that can be leveled at this study, of course, and it could be that this is wrong and the Backfire Effect does exist, but as so much of Destiny's platform is predicated on understanding and countering cognitive bias I thought it wouldn't hurt to keep him up to date on the research surrounding this particular one.I'm interested in hearing how did you guys find out about Destiny and what made you stick around?

My case is pretty common, Destiny was one of the biggest streamer in SC2, the guys bigger than him were inconsistent in their streams, I liked the humor, the edginess.. so I watched on and off for years, even though I don't play SC2 or any game anymore, it's still fun to put the stream as a background noise and to keep up with the drama and wholesomeness on stream/reddit/twitter(rip in pieces).

Also all those years and I'm mostly just a lurker in chat and I like to read more than write in it.Alexander the Great or khan shows thissome interesting stuffAll smart guys with good insight whose humor plays really well off each otherIt could be at least mildly interesting? As a haven for right leaning people I can't help but wonder what kinds of shenanigans would happen if Destiny suddenly built a presence there. It's supposed to be a place that's more respectful of edgy views so it could be harder for him to get banned there for mass reporting? Maybe?


&gt;Welcome to Gab, a social network that champions free speech, individual liberty, and the free flow of information online. All are welcome.A weekly or biweekly podcast with Harkdan, Devin, Destiny and guests would be really cool imo, they all get along great and are all very entertaining. Thoughts?Honestly, just upvote this if you think Steven should stop playing League of Legends.So far, I'm not impressed.  
The official subreddit, /r/liberalist, is in rather poor shape, so is their other social media.

Their biggest problem, however, is the fact that their entire movement is centered around Sargon,  
hence the term "Sargon Justice Warriors". It is little more than a reboot of "Kekistan", an attempt at activism by Sargon that'd give him relevancy beyond being a moderately popular youtuber.

And with the course it's taking, it seems inevitable for the "liberalist movement" to revolve entirely around the person of Carl Benjamin, aka Sargon. 

My predictions: It'll either fade into obscurity or turn into Sargon's personal goon squad, to defend m'Lady whenever someone's bruising his ego.  
Not unlike Jordan Peterson's followers, the difference being that Peterson is vastly more successful than Sargon by any metric.


Any thoughts on the issue?Here it is: https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/7nltbx/a_response_to_mouthy_buddhas_race_realism_video/

It happened here about a month ago, and I couldn't be more greatful. As a person who doesn't know shit about genetics, but argues with race realists often, I struggled debunking the genetic foundation of their argument. However, when somebody posted this reddit thread, it helped me make their arguments completely void.

Basically, from what little understanding I have of the topic, I came to realize that race realism is the genetic science version of political populism. It boils very complex topics down to simple, easy to understand conclusions that stupid people are easily attracted to: "different skin colors exist, therefore race is real."

Now what happens in arguments is I usually link them this thread with all the race debunking studies listed there, after which they usually just say "thanks, but I'm not interested in reading all that," to which I reply "if you're not interested in the research, why the fuck do you have such strong opinions on the topic?"

tldr; bless the person who linked this thread, the people in the thread that kicked JF's shit in, and thank you for handing me the tools to eliminate arguments for race realism. I don't know if Destiny saw this, but it would provide him with some very good material to argue the topic in the future.That is if he started his promiscuous escapades in 1996 as he claims. But I'm  calling bullshit on these claims. How do you answer to these charges /u/jfgariepy ? Something about fucking with your circadian rhythm so you sleep for 12 hours and are awake for 24 or something. I thought that sounded pretty interesting but I can't remember the name of it, and I cbf to go back through the vod.Destiny I love you buddy but last nights conversation with harkdan and the other guy was full of false claims and inaccuracies. It triggered the fuck out of me. 
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/226761391?t=03h34m22s


**Ritalin and ADHD Memes**

&gt; Claim: Ritalin causes heart problems. Ritalin causes heart problems long term.


This claim is kinda true, but misleading.
Some research suggest it increases risk of arrythmia and heart attack in the first few weeks after taking it, no long term effects have been shown to my knowledge. The risk is still very small, so for most people with ADHD the benefits of ritalin probably far outweighs this alleged side-effect. So I think the claim is potentially true, in the sense that it is true that Auschwitz had a swimming pool. 
http://www.bmj.com/content/353/bmj.i2550

&gt; Claim: Randy: ADHD is much more environmental. Sugar, computers, etc.


Probably just wrong. Twin studies show high heritability, causes of ADHD is not well understood, but there is a combination of genetic and environmental factors. 
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00787-010-0097-5

&gt; randy: there are legit severe adhd, is it measurable? chemical imbalance?


There is no blood test or similar, no. But it is measurable. 

**Is ADHD overdiagnosed?**


I am not qualified to answer. Maybe, maybe not, depends which studies you read. But the absolute outrage and panic about this is completely unjustified in my opinion. If there is overdiagnosis it is probably moderate, and if your kid gets diagnosed the safest bet is to trust the diagnosis, or at least get a second opinion before you decide that a media-frenzy driven outrage over misdiagnosis and overdiagnosis is enough to risk leaving a serious disorder go untreated. 
The research and scientific debate about overdiagnosis will continue, largely unaffected by popular opinion. The hysteria will cause many false-negatives. 
This is my opinion, I don't know.

https://capmh.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13034-016-0140-5


**Autism**


&gt; Randy: For everyone with legit autism, maybe 10 are misdiagnosed. Or 5. I don't know.


This would be the biggest scandal in psychology since lobotomy, and demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of autism, in my opinion. I would have to see some very convincing studies before I would consider such a proposition.


&gt; Autism is environmental


Autism is caused by an interplay between genes and environment as is everything. It is also highly heritable. 

&gt; Heritability of ASD


https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2654804
Interestingly mutations happening after conception seems to play a role, god knows if any mutagens in our modern environment is causing it.
http://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(17)30322-1

**Fluoride**

&gt; Claim: Fluoride in the water is only explanation. what else.


While fluoride is far from the only explanation as destiny points out, some studies show a correlation between fluoridization of water and levels of cognitive impairment. However, there could easily be confounds in my opinion, we don't know yet.
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892036214001809

**Major depressive disorder, or "Legit clinical depression"**


&gt; randy: there is such a thing as legit clinical adhd, legit clinical depression legit clinical autism, but every person that say they have it probably doesn't. There is a way bigger problem with overdiagnosing these problems. They are environmental disorders. 

&gt; randy: I have met a lot of people who are depressed. Ive met quite a few people who can break out of it. Ive met many who need medication. More people want to victimize themselves as depressed to avoid responsibility than those who are actually sick. 


I know you don't claim to be experts, but this part of the conversation triggered the fuck out of me. 


&gt; Are they environmental disorders?


No, as everything else there is an interplay between genes and environment, but these are all highly heritable.

&gt; Are people victimizing themselves to avoid responsibility?


I don't think Randy is capable of deciding which of the people he meets that are suffering from legit depression, and those who fake it to avoid responsibility. Consider that a typical depressive episode will last a few months. If you happen to meet Randy by the end of your episode he will conclude that you were not really depressed. And you will suffer recurrent episodes 1-2-3 years later. I wouldn't even trust a  psychiatrist to tell me the severity of someones depression without using Becks depression inventory or something similar. Unless I see some good data, I seriously doubt that most people who suffer from major depressive disorder are faking it or deluding themselves. Unfortunately such sentiments are common, and is basically a variation of the just pull yourself together trope. In my opinion this displays a fundamental misunderstanding of depression.

&gt; Randy: People are like gee I wonder why I am depressed, when they sit at computer 8 hours a day, etc take pills, sleep problems, bad food, no interaction, doing all the things humans never did. 


Fair enough, behavioral changes can help, but these are also symptoms of depression. You seem to suggest that their depression is caused by these behaviors, and thus blaming them for their illness, without actually knowing the etymology. 

&gt; Other countries are obviously not as depressed as here right. And you can look at their activity and see that they are different. 


It's the other way around. Western, gender-egalitarian, rich, democratic countries have lower prevalence of major depressive disorder in both sexes, but especially in men.

&gt; randy: Isn't depression correlated with wealth?
&gt; destiny: Absolutely not. look at MItch, rich but miserable. I have good perspective, I was poor and now im wealthy. You have problems as poor, that is fixed by money, but it doesn't fix emotional problems, doesn't fix self-image, doesn't fix relationships with other people. doesnt fix lack of self esteeem, money will never fix those things. noone feels better about themselves by buying something, unless it's a piano.


The two case studies does not convincingly refute the claim. Globally some say that rich countries are less depressed, and some say more. I would say that there is more evidence for rich countries being less depressed.

https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/85/4/1483/2234883?redirectedFrom=PDF

There is a relationship between income and depression within countries as well: Richer are less depressed. The exact direction is unclear, but employment and financial strain seems to be causal. The most important thing seems to be how rich you are relative to those around you. 
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hec.1011/full

&gt; you get in a relationship to use the other person as band aid of personal problem, which is why people get destroyed when they break up.


No source, but this is probably wrong. My guess is that heartache has some evolutionary benefit. It's easy to hypothesise how, for instance motivating pleading behavior to try to salvage the relationship, makes you call them, court them etc. but there is no data that I am aware of.

&gt; This is why cheating is so demonized on the internet: because the person that is the source of your happiness betrays you, the one you depend on for your self esteem etc.


Cheating is demonized on the internet yes, but it is demonized everywhere, for good reason. Men are never 100% sure of paternity, and women risk that their man provide for other children. Jealousy can increase fitness, by reducing the severity of these problems. 
http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9280.1992.tb00038.x


&gt; randy: Study says: Most successful people are sociopaths. CEOS etc


Higher prevalence of narcissism and anti-social personality disorder yes, but it's absolutely not most.

Sorry if I misrepresented anyone.
It was a long time ago. He was reading a green text from 4chan about this guy that was mad about girls wanting to be included in gaming culture after he had been vindicated by these same people when gaming and nerd culture had just started. And the release of that stupid destiny the game has making the search for it near impossible. Well let's see if this goes anywhere https://mobile.twitter.com/i/safety/notifications/reports/NvEjiiRBGTJu-hmbkZgWCFQ?periodType=0hey buddy. a few things you are misunderstanding. rupert murdoch is not jewish. 

I can tell by your accent you're from sydney/nsw area so the biggest problem for us atm is not unemployment, it's affordable housing. recent census puts millennials spending about 80% of a median income on rent. this is something that will be addressed by the centre because like america we run a service economy. you can't have the next wave of the workforce spending 80% of their income on rent and keep services running. 

our unemployment rate hasn't changed much since the 90s under keating and then howard. why people are feeling the pinch is because cost-of-living has risen by 200+% by some aggregates. let's just say over 100% to be conservative. so while it was possible to live off of part-time work in the 90s/00s that's not possible anymore. one of the reasons for the rise is the GST which was supposed to give us a stronger dollar globally, so we're not likely to see externality policies lowering it any time soon.

this does not mean jobs have shrunk but another thing to consider. is busting the unions and quasi-work choice policies have had a big impact in wage stagnation and loss of full time employment to a radically casualising economy. this is a good laymen overview: http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-16/jericho-10-years-on,-the-spirit-of-workchoices-still-lives/7248368

immigration. we take a large amount of immigrants because they are keeping our economy afloat and have been since ww1. we never recovered from loosing a whole generation of men under the british command of the united imperial forces. no doubt you've been given the heroic bloodshed story of gallipoli. in the interwar period we had a 'populate or perish' mentality that continued through to the end of ww2. our baby boom is largely due to policies like the beautiful balts. this made economic immigration into an almost constant state policy. consider our national pathology of tall poppy syndrome and immigration is apart of our national character. so stopping immigration would mean we would drastically shrink our economy and destroy the 'fair go' ethic. 

I'm happy to over the social research with you if you pm me but the dingos/far-right have nothing but simplistic answers to historic problems and most of the time they are blaming the wrong social affects.When discussing Steve's "risk" taking, Dan brought up how crazy it was Destiny didn't have car insurance. They then referenced the chat and Destiny laughed saying "most of them think what I'm doing is illegal!" And they all guffawed as if it wasn't illegal to not have car insurance. 

I'm scared to ask, but in all 50 states (I've heard New Hampshire MAAAAY be different) but isn't it absolutely illegal not to have car insurance??? What am I missing here?

He may be willing to outweigh the considered low risk of a wreck with being caught without insurance (though they check at traffic stops in most states as well), but it is still very much illegal not to have it, particularly in Nebraska. What am I missing....?thoughts ?Yesterday, Destiny asked us to stop circle jerking when talking about Jordan Peterson.
(https://clips.twitch.tv/BoldFastTermiteSSSsss)

This hit home for me really hard. I've known for a long time that I hate the guy, but I've been very conscious of the fact that I can't approach his claims honestly. It's bothered me for a while. It's not like Ben Shapiro, who's arguments are factually false and claims are blatantly invalid. 

In fact, the Jordan Peterson clip Destiny reacted to was the first one I felt I could even argue with at all. And still, I wasn't able to do it as well as Destiny could.

I understand the value of critically considering the opposition and responding honestly, but I'm more than ready to admit that I can't. That's why I watch Destiny. He can put together the argument, and he can articulate it much better than I ever can. 

"If a woman should be able to dress up provocatively, and not expect sexual reactions to that, then why can't a person spout racist slurs and not expect angry reactions to that?" Destiny gives this hypothetical, "*I* know the answer. Do you?"

Honestly, I don't. That seems like a bullet proof argument to me. Of course it *feels* wrong in every way, but that isn't enough. I feel like I'm usually pretty good at this stuff, but since I've started watching Destiny, I've felt much smaller about my ability to approach discussions objectively and logically. He's just so much better than I am. I can do the pedophile one really well. There are several debates where I watched Destiny come to the same conclusion I did in the exact same way. But there are just as many arguments where I'm realizing he's several steps ahead, and I'm just stuck.

He want's the left to stop doing this sort of thing. It's his biggest complaint. I think he stands the best chance to stop it though, by walking people through the empirical argument when they can't do it themselves. I hope we'll get more Jordan Peterson content soon, because I really need it.... such as "Everything mentioned in this stream is part of the entertainment. The participants are not serious about what they say. Also fuck Mr. Mouton."

I guess it should blink in the upper left corner or so... then we are totally fine. Right guys? RIGHT?! I mean... that's what Twitch said is totally alright!I participated in parliamentary debate for many years, and one of the most useful ways of keeping track of a discussion is through the use of numbered contentions.

For any typical argument, numbering your points and then your opposition's points is incredibly useful as to not lose track of a conversation.

Not using this method leads to arguments going around in circles quite often, or people not concisely getting across their points, resulting in a strawman.

If Destiny lost some of his fluidity in how he talked and stuck to a concise point by point argument format he can easily half the amount of time it takes a debate to take place.

This also just works for any debate online, if you're responding with multiple points made in some conversation, please for the love of god organize it. It goes from zero effort rambling to ordered civil discussion real fast.mrcrouton's laugh always KINDA sounds like he's crying, and not laughing. Someone sees that and probably wouldn't realize its a joke. Back a few weeks ago when I was a starry young lad combing through Destiny's tweets like a severely dehydrated dog at a water bowl, I remember Destiny talking about a video about the difference between compassion and empathy. If anyone knows the video and could leave a link that would be great; EDIT: https://twitter.com/nicemangos to anyone interestedlike two weeks or whenever the twitch thing goes into effect, r/live stream fails will be the single greatest honeypot ever seen, twitch top brass will be hired by letter agencies to get terrorists. Screenshot this.Look, my main gripe with Peterson is that he is very out of depth in social scientific fields beyond psychology. He attempts to give intellectual legitimacy to alt-right/skepto/redpill by attempting to integrate trendy social topics with very narrow and mundane psychological observations. In doing so, he provides these groups with a set of academic terminology-as-ammunition to attack other disciplines for being intellectually dishonest and full of "SJW" profs. The two most problematic concepts that he has weaponized are 'postmodernism' and 'cultural Marxism'. As to the former, it is clear that Peterson has a very poor understanding of postmodernism and its position within current social scientific though and methodology. 

For most social scientists beyond psych, postmodernism represents a form of critique that became very popular in the 80s and 90s and ended up lending itself to a form of radical philosophical perspectivism. Though still valuable in some regards, the majority of academics in social scientific disciplines today (particularly sociology and social anthropology) are very critical of the radical perspectivist approach that postmodernism lends itself to. They are also critical of the privilege that postmodernism gives to language over other forms of being in the world. So while many social scientific academics today give credit to the contributions of the postmodern analytic (particularly the insights it gave on the complicated ways in which meaning in language and identity is formed), most scholars I know adopt a kind of critical realist or ontological realist analytical approach in social science today -- positions that are still critical of the social conclusions of early forms of science but do not give language authority over the natural world in meaning-making processes as was often the case with postmodernism.

Now here's the ironic thing: Peterson criticizes the radical left for engaging in identity politics yet he himself has created an identity out of postmodernism (and cultural Marxism) which he ascribes to radical leftists, activists, and academics. In fact, most of his arguments for postmodernism-as-identity and postmodernism-as-activism seem to have developed out of his response to a very small group of idiot leftist activists at U of T who harassed him and seemed to have developed arguments out of antiquated postmodern theory. It's like they got to the postmodernism chapter of their introductory textbook and dropped it there. 
In his rebuke, Peterson wrongly took the actions of these few individuals and argued that they represent the current state of other social scientific disciplines. From this, many of his alt-right followers have picked up on this language and throw it around to discredit complicated arguments and even entire academic disciplines. Peterson often talks about how he is outraged when people threaten his career over his ideas yet he encourages these right wing groups to attack large groups of professors and disciplines as a whole through his dogwhistling about the "plague of postmodernism and cultural Marxism". He is hypocritical as fuck in this regard and no one really calls him out on it and his awareness of the theoretical and philosophical positions of his colleagues within sister disciplines is woeful. 

Let’s be real, Peterson is an intelligent psychologist and academic but he is so out of his depth when it comes to sociological issues. He has a kind of god complex where he feels like he has all the answers about everything in life because he is pretty good at psychology. Psychology has a notoriously bad rep within universities for trying to overstep its reach and Peterson is the personification of that. Also, he might not be fully conscious of it, but it’s been clear from the beginning that he enjoys the spotlight and the idea of himself as a celebrity academic. He likes stirring up shit and a large part of me feels like he does so because he likes being the center of it (though I don’t think he would ever even admit that to himself). 

If you want to see how Peterson attracts susceptible, moderately-educated individuals, just look at his two appearances on the H3H3 podcast. He woos Ethan and Hila with his experience as a psychologist and then transitions to commentary on larger social issues without them questioning his credentials in this field -- all while using anti-SJW rhetoric as lubricant. The average alt-light-right-classical-liberal-conservative-centrist Youtuber has no clue what the fuck postmodernism or cultural Marxism is, what they represent, or their position within modern day academia, yet they’ve heard these terms for the first time through Peterson and it gives them a way to blame woes of our current society and universities on a form of fictional academic/activist identity. 
TL;DR: Destiny, get up to speed with Peterson. At this point, you have a responsibility to do so. He’s a smart psychologist but is woefully out of his depth when he engages in sociology/philosophy and has a very poor awareness of current thought in these fields. He attempts to give uneducated individuals/platforms on the right academic authenticity by creating activist and academic identities out of concepts that he has a very poor understanding of.  
I casually watch some of Destiny's videos and enjoy them (don't really have the time to watch streams or anything). In his most recent video, [A Conversation with Dr. Layman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpbvbjU4fxM), he mentions that he used to be very right-leaning and said that he used to argue for the right to say whatever you want, etc. (near 2:30) and now he's changed. Are there any videos out there talking about that change? Or any sort of debate where he discusses why it's not right to say whatever you want?

Maybe I'm subconsciously really a right-wing idiot, but I just feel as if nowadays we are really walking on eggshells and doing a lot of mental gymnastics whenever we speak. A good example is a forum discussion I was reading earlier talking about whether or not it's right to use the phrase "you guys" when referring to a group. It just seems insane how far we are now and my jimmies are throughly rustled... does Destiny ever discuss anything like this?

ThanksDestiny just said that he will be deleting his VODs in fear of getting banned by any offense he may have committed in them.Hey everyone, and hey Destiny if you see this! I had a story that I wanted to share, to argue just how valuable the work that's being done in these debates that he has been having is. I'll be providing a slightly edited copy paste of an email I sent, because i thought it might be valuable for you guys to read as well. I'm a very wordy person, so I apologize, but otherwise hope you enjoy! 

────────

I'm mainly writing this however, because I heard you mention that you were losing faith in the value of the discussions that you have been having. I don't remember exactly what was said, and if you meant your discussions with the "skeptics", or the political discussions in general (I sure hope not). I wanted to make an argument that what you are doing is incredibly valuable. Alot of this will be speaking from my experience, just as a disclaimer.

Anyways, I'm 28, and I grew up listening to conservative talk radio just like you. I didn't really follow politics after I was 16, until GamerGate many years later. I wasn't a GGer by any means, but as a gamer, it was really my reintroduction into politics. Around this time, my main concern was automation (after watching that YouTube video that was big about it), and AGI and how we needed polices (like UBI) that addressed the issues that would come up in a rapidly changing future.  Anyways, the extent of my political activism at that point was posts on facebook, and donating money to Bernie Sanders and some phonebanking stuff. I even got pretty SJWish, and said crazy leftist things I wouldn't even say today. Sometime around the point where it became clear that he was going to lose, and the campaign and Bernie seemed to publicly recognize it, I felt betrayed when he continued to take and accept donations from the people who were excited about his policies. This was pretty naive and shortsighted of me in hindsight. 

After this, I saw Milo Yiannopowhatever on Joe Rogan, and he seemed rather intelligent, wasn't questioned by Rogan, and worst of all he gave a coherent (I use this term loosely) argument for supporting Trump. Shortly after, maybe even the same day, I searched on youtube "in support of Trump" or something like that and got to this Stefan Molyneux video where he made a 2 hour argument in favor of voting for Trump. He was even a "principled non voter", and changed his mind to come out in support of him. I got hooked. At the time, I was working around 60 hours a week, and didn't have much time to do my own research, and he seemed intelligent enough. 

This part is going to be super cringe so get ready. A couple months after, still following Molyneux, and watching him everyday, I quit my job. It was for unrelated reasons, but with my new freetime, I spent an obscene amount of time on social media arguing with anyone who would listen, or with an audience who would. Obviously I was entirely wrong about many many things, but for the most part no one could present an argument against me. I know that I changed many minds (nothing that realistically had an impact, but still), and many people tagged me in posts as the guy who could make arguments to liberals in support of Trump, when they couldn't. I did this by projecting my leftist ideas onto Trump, and then spouting many of the conspiracy theories that came from the right. I read a ton of the wikileaks emails as they were coming out, and helped compile information to show how evil Hillary Clinton was. I began to hold many fascist views, not because I hated people, but because I bought into a ton of the conspiracy theories about BLM, Cultural Marxism, George Soros type shit. I was in a scary world, where InfoWars literally seemed like a valid source of information. Even scarier, I considered them a "limited hangout" that only gave out a bit of true information, but in a way that would alienate them from the general public. Anything that I wanted to believe, to fit my narrative, was readily available to me. Most importantly, I felt like I was fulfulling some sort of meaning and purpose in life, because everything seemed so grave.

Anyways this continued like this, all the way until JonTron talked on Sargon's stream, and when you called him out after, I watched your discussion. I followed you after that, and watched pretty much all your content since. I didn't change my views right away, my views still dont match with yours (from the left) but you eventually completely discredited many people who I respected, and more importantly gave the good arguments against my positions that I was really looking for. You taught me invaluable critical thinking skills. Eventually I was able to give solid ground to many of the leftist positions that I originally had. 

That's my story. I know this is anecdotal, but I'm sure there are other people like me. The point of telling you this is because I think you are uniquely in the position to pull people like me, who fell into this same hole I fell in. You're edgy, intelligent, sharp witted, but most importantly you are just right wing enough that you have credibility with people who may seem to be too far gone. I think there are alot of people like me in the circles I was in who just need to be yanked back into reality. I don't know if this matters much to you, but I think you are crucial in providing a space for "leftist youtube", even though I'm not sure I would categorize you with them. Maybe I'm biased because of my experience, but I cannot place a value on how how important you are for these ends.So I was watching the Dick Masterson video and thought "Hey, good for him, at least he kinda admitted he was wrong" and I randomly thought of H3H3. Hey maybe they "reformed", maybe they are back to Vape Naish days, so I browsed their videos and randomly clicked on one:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj8n78AuN3w

Please watch it, it's pretty short. This video is so bad, ignorant and full of misinformation. There are 4 points that I would like to address:

- Ethan insinuates that Youtube is picking winners by pushing their boi Kimmel and demonetizing everyone else. Except for the fact that you are not watching Jimmy Kimmel channel, you are watching ABC channel. They have a multimillion partnership with youtube with hundreds of channels, everything from news to entertainment and Youtube knows they are not putting dogshit even if it's about sensitive topics. Advertisers are fine with their channels. Unfair? Kinda. But if MCMs didn't suck dick, you could make a same deal while ensuring youtube that all the channels in the group will be responsible.

- Ethan says that youtube is faking trending videos because his bois are not getting top spots while Kimmel does. This is such a dogshit. At first youtube had most viewed videos, but it created small echochamber of talentless hacks who always got top spot because they had lot of subs. Then they scrapped it because it was bad, but then they brought it back as "trending" videos. Nobody knows precise algorithm but main aspect is that it heavily weighs links from outside. Kimmel got top spot because it was shared all over social media (and so did Jake Paul video fyi)

- Ethan says  that these advertisers don't give a shit about making money of tragedy. Yeah, that's true, but they do care about how tragedy is covered!! CNN is clean and safe, same canned Wolf Blitzer or Anderson Cooper. But on youtube you have video titled "Vegas terrorist attack" and in the fucking video you have some wacko talking about crisis actors and deep state staging another hoax! **Advertisers do not want to be associated with that shit!** Unlike Twitch and their private gestapo, youtube has different policy on content policing (and the other method would not be even feasible here, youtube is thousand times bigger), youtube content algorithm auto disqualifies videos based on tags and titles.

- And finally he talks about death of youtube, which is hilarious. In fact I would say youtube is having it's renaissance! Over the past year or so I have organically found so many new  interesting channels full of creative people (Wendover productions, Great War, Real Engineering, Historia Civilis, Joseph Anderson and so on) while all the trash vloggers (granted, Casey Neistat, but he is like 0.1%) have gone away. They seem to be thriving in the new system. When these small channels make really good video, it starts to get shared, starts trending and so many people discover them. 

Not reformed, 100% done with them. When Destiny talked about having responsibility to your audience, this is the prime example! 6.5mil views, 99% liked, not a single top comment critical of any points. Such horseshit. Ethan does not have sliver of doubt that he is 100% correct on everything, thinks youtube are maniacal evil people. When has this dude who was making fun videos turned into such an ignorant ass?So they are playing league and Destiny went to get something, LoLYourPrincess then starts to talk to her chat and at one point she says:

&gt;"Destiny says lot of words that shouldn't be said. He says the f-word, the r-word, the n-word, the c-word!"

And predictably dgg starts spamming those words and right then Destiny returns and she goes:

&gt;"Wow, Destiny! Your D.gg chat is so racist! Look at all those bad words they are spamming! Why is your chat so racist?!"

Destiny:

&gt; "They are not, lol."

Princess:

&gt;"Then why are they writing it?"

&gt;"Ban them!"

&gt;"Ban them!"

And he did! LUL Destiny got outclassed in this debate.https://overrustlelogs.net/stalk?channel=destiny&amp;nick=uganda_warrior_trihard


lol apparently having your favorite emote in your name is bannable.

I was subbed to mr.mouton on that account, thx for reporting me destiny fanThe only real difference I see between the two is that social darwinism openly advocates for eugenics. I think ive heard warski or some other skeptic that they would support voluntary eugenics? I may be wrong on that, but it’s pretty hard to ignore the similarities  * debate with Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson, and Dave Rubin at the same time

or

* threesome with Badbunny and Lilypichu live on twitch

or

* quit playing League of Legends foreverI'm asking this here, because this isn't exactly the kind of thing I could find on Google. I remember that the term Alt-Right in the beginning really just referred to the movement of young conservatives on the internet on websites like twitter reddit and /pol/. These days it only refers to white supremacists. I'm wondering when that shift happened and why.I started watching the debates a few months back and still have yet to develop an understanding of where each debate personality stands. I was hoping someone could run me down where each persons major beliefs stand?

Ex. Sargon, Richard Spencer, JF, etc

Thanks

Really like the way destinys debates go but as of late I feel like I'm essentially becoming a mini-destiny. Just need some new ideasThe fact that the changes affect old videos retroactively is probably at least a pain in the ass for many streamers, but other than that, I think these changes are overdue if anything. Twitch has allowed their community to become a cesspool of racism, sexism and harassment over years of lax rules. The gamers demographic has unequivocally proven that it's absolutely uncontainable and will resort to hatred if not under heavy moderation. I honestly hope *all* these losers who have fostered a racist following and are now unsure how to contain their garbage fans will get their useless asses banned for life, move back to mommy's basement if they ever left it in the first place, and work retail for the rest of their miserable lives.You guys are just as bad as the subreddits of Destiny's opponents that never stop posting about him months after debates.

Yes they're both shit, can we just move on?We all know the jokes about League by now, I'm not here to make those I honestly just don't watch when he plays it. The Nier playthrough recently was okay but I didn't watch the whole thing, I would skip through parts where he kept dying repeatedly because he insists on playing on the hardest difficulty. To make it worse he seems to welcome spoilers.

Without trying to be too mean Destiny doesn't really have any standout qualities when it comes to video game streaming. He can be funny but hours can go by without any humour. He isn't eSports level good at anything. He doesn't have a reliable group of people to play with that have a cool dynamic together. Plus his insistence on League is a bit confusing, it honestly sucks to watch he even admits this.

The general enjoyment and I think viewership count always comes during his different streams. When he is debating people is an obvious plus. When he goes browsing around whether its looking at random content, looking at educational content to discuss with the viewers or looking at political/social stuff. Hell the house critique video was awesome.

I hear Destiny quite often talk about making money, about the things he considers with his job and how it could affect income. If he switched to this sort of thing full time I am almost certain it'd vastly increase his bottom line. Plus add a Patreon to the mix, double dipping? What kind of excuse is that, if people want to throw money at you then fucking let them.

There is the recent Twitch rules issue to consider. I don't know about everyone here but I don't give a fuck where Destiny is streaming, if he is doing content I enjoy I will go wherever is necessary to watch it. Hell he even complains about how the right seems to have taken over Youtube, why not challenge them then. Plus if these rules mean a heavily neutered Destiny with a lot less of the edgy, dramatic content than before then fuck Twitch, I'd rather he left now.

While I am not sure I would say stop doing any kind of gaming whatsoever, I am not sure I'd miss it if it went. I certainly wouldn't miss League. I do miss the edgelord debate King I started watching Destiny for in the first place.I don't know how biased I am, but I feel like most of the time Destiny doesn't go on to big of tirades on shit he doesn't actually understand, but this nutrition garbage triggered the fuck out of me.

It seems like a pretty common thing among people who haven't even taken a single second to understand anything about it beyond the "SUGAR IS SO FUCKING BAD AND THEY LIED TO US ABOUT FATS" memes. 

Sure you can claim that fat isn't the biggest evil on the planet, but it's fucking ridiculous to shift that claim onto sugar when it's all just a problem of calories when it comes to that. 

On the flip side, it ISN'T just a problem of calories when it comes to consuming sat fats/cholesterol/heme iron. These things have clearly shown negative effects on the body, REGARDLESS of whether you are overweight or not.

I'm not saying you have to be a vegan or something, but it's ridiculously disingenuous to act like all the meat you're chomping down on is so fucking healthy compared to "processed foods".


Extra-

Destiny doesn't seem to think Pasta/Breads/Rice are complex carbs, what the fuck does he think they are then, on top of the fact that he doesn't think food that is the MOST FILLING isn't filling??
https://youtu.be/e3Of5jEzkGM?t=57m16sI haven’t watched his latest league streams, pretty out of the loop I emailed Steven. He said to post this here. I'm gonna reword it a bit (moved some pronouns around) and leave it for open discussion:

--

I watched the veganism debate here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ssj0AYumQY and noticed that he  mentioned dogs (due to selective breeding and domestication) are probably the best argument one could make towards forming a social contract with an animal.

I have also been looking for his thoughts on abortion, and I am seeing that he's generally opposed on the basis of potential for life and potential of a social contract once an embryo is formed (Please correct me if I am mistaken).

I was wondering if there's a place where he elaborates on either topic. Where is the line between these two ideas? An embryo and a domesticated animal both have a probability of forming a social contract (not the same probability, obviously, but one exists?). Is it because an embryo (provided it naturally develops to full term) is more likely to be able to recognize and reciprocate the social contract than a dog?

If one is able to assume some probability of a future social contract with an embryo, what prevents them from extending that reasoning to a domesticated dog? And so on.

Obviously there's a lot more going on in the abortion debate like a woman's right to self and what is actually practical for society. I am intentionally omitting those ideas because I don't think they're directly relevant to this (but would also be happy to discuss them).

Looking forward to hearing (ALL) your thoughts.
Anytime I tune into the stream, it's always Destiny spending endless hours playing some boring RTS game not saying anything.

All the content that happens inbetween is overwhelming and difficult to catch up on.  The subreddit and discord is swarmed with people in the know.

Destiny drama*Because they supply endless material for memes.So Overrustle was watching first couple of HP and afterwards I started to watch rest since I haven't watched them for very long time. The entire series is based on danger of nazis!

The whole conflict is based on "pure-blood" wizards supremacists wanting to dominate weakest humans (muggles) and kill all the ones "invited to the wizard world". Existence of Voldemort and his followers is being so ignored that to say his name, or accuse anyone to be follower of his brings gasps in polite society. His followers will vehemently deny any allegiance while doing anything to bring back the dark lord.

All this culminates in the 5th book where Harry is so smeared by Voldemort affiliated press that his former friends are turning on him! And the government is so petrified to admit Voldemort has returned that they ignore it and instead go after Harry!

Jesus fuck, if book came out today, it would be labeled as leftist propaganda attack on conservative values. Fuck me, we live in dark times. I have to say, I didn't know why she was so politically active, maybe she was just pandering, but now I fucking love her. It must be hard watching all these parallels you wrote coming alive.... but League with lily is honestly some of the best content there is. I love those two together.So i posted a [](/DANKMEMES )bad boy meme[](/DANKMEMES ) in the destiny discord.

So is there an argument for there being a difference between being kicked out of a mall for shouting racial slurs vs being banned for doing it in a youtube chat? The guy blocked me after saying "dense af" without providing a counter argument. Title is self explanatory....if your voice is sounding raspy and coarse, i will never say you are hoarse. i respect you and horse. don't use horse as an insult


if you're standing naked without a care, i will never say you are bare. i respect you and bears. don't use bear as an insult


if hanging out with you is a chore, i will never call you a bore. i respect you and boars. don't use boar as an insult

tl;dr; you lazy mofoIve watched a couple of debates on his stream, the Tariq Nasheed/Jared Talor one most recently, and I have to say it's far better than Warski's. He doesn't interrupt with a million SUPACHATS, or much at all really, and probably most importantly there is no JF. Plus he seems to have connections to a fair few people.

I have no love for the guy, it's just an idea.I was just considering all the people Destiny has debated or talked with who are precisely those moaning about western degeneracy without by definition being examples thereof. These guys prize evolution, generally as a reason to be racist, that there are these foundational differences between human beings that can't be solved without anything but the formation of ethnostates, peaceful ones mind you, but can't grasp their head around the concept the world is better than it's ever been. 

I don't mean this in some peak neoliberal defence of capitalism way or anything, but that with the advent of nuclear bombs, a concept so beyond anything theoretical but what would be considered godlike to a man a hundred years before, mankind would be semi-forced into an awkward state of peace. Not entirely, no not even close, but generally. The Western modern definition of "war casualties" at home is generally a crowd of people, who fell prey to a deranged gunman or a deranged bomber or a deranged improviser, because western countries have not known real war in 70 years. Losses are foreign and tragic and get great films and not at home near our hearts in numbers far too large to bear. So the decreased sum is adjusted to and a foreign crowd in the west of whom we know exeedingly little of is terrifying. And the fear, so carefully harvested, is put to use to dehumanise what we deem inhuman, generalisations made of general billions, wars far away in countries we cant imagine to keep us safe. And so these humans who fall too far for that one, who have so skewed a perception of the world, that ethnostates seem eminently reasonable, not describable or practical, but surely necessary. And there's apparently enough of them for people like Richard Spencer to have large audiences, however much these numbers reflect that , RS for 80k twitter followers, and more crypto/intro to racism ones like Laura Southern and her 330k, which indicates this is while percentage wise not a great problem, there's a significant base to springboard from. I don't say this like there's a racist fascist state on the immediate horizon, but that from the small percentage of the [part of the population](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-neo-nazi-support-american-public-charlottesville-white-supremacists-kkk-far-right-poll-a7907091.html) that believes in explicit white nationalism (about 9%) one gets a jump to in the 30's of white nationalist views, like the 16% that strongly or somewhat agree that different races shouldn't be allowed to marry each other or the 31% that agree that America must protect and preserve its White European heritage. It's not all bad, freedom, solely as a word with no logistics bearing it down, is disagreed with only 5% of the time. 

But this is all sidetracking. These deluded people, allowing feels to beat reals, who look charitably at the past don't seem to realise that along a lot of the criteria they prize, the prevention of rape of white women and wars fought against white people, this time period is fairly nice. Thank god we have a racist who'll get us into another war!This isn't gonna be groundbreaking or anything, but isn't it ironic that these people on the right (centrists^^TM to alt-righters) are all up in arms about censorship from the SJW and the MSM and yet they've been able to openly push white nationalist ideas with barely to no repercussions?

A few years ago people on the right would've claimed that society didn't let them talk about ideas such as being pro-life and look at where we are now. Openly talking about ethnic cleansing, deportations and low IQ genes.

Obviously social media gives them a platform that they didn't have access to 8 years ago (well, technically they did have access to it but they weren't exploited as much). Yet, even if YouTube isn't the MSM, it's still fucking owned by Google and it gives them even more reach than they couldn't ever have dreamed of.

You get to openly be a neo-nazi without being lynched by society. Better yet, you get to openly be a neo-nazi and market it on a mainstream platform to make a living. These fucks talking about censorship and how freedom of speech is in danger is an absolute joke.So here's this weeks spreadsheet, just a couple things before you ask.

1. % of total time is &gt;100% because of overlap of multiple things (discussions while playing games for example)
2. If you want to sort the columns, click file&gt;download as and download the spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rj87GIdK52KhwN2u7au-YV_0duWiCefFhhfpFNnuIqU/

Also, Hillshire has put together an awesome site related to the spreadsheet here https://infinite-cliffs-94665.herokuapp.com/ You can sort by category/topic, navigate the vod by parts, and there are links to timestamps for everything. The site searches for my post every 3 hours so this weeks spreadsheet should be on there within 3 hours from this post.

Also, here's the link to next weeks spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w9e036IYK38EjrldkTuBhXA90acAQ3ye7rCosrbCHnw
I'll be updating that throughout the week, not going to promise anything as far as keeping it up to date daily but it feels pretty dumb sometimes having most of the spreadsheet done and just waiting for the week to be over to post it.Can we all go to Athene's new Let's hold twitch accountable subreddit and state we need to keep twitch accountable and keep Athene banned? From my understanding, it should be allowed as long as you are not toxic in your post. :) thanks.MrMoisture and DesTINY should just go at it, honestly.I feel like it’s a game right up Destiny’s alley. And it has plenty of endings to explore, gameplay evolves constantly and has an actual story behind it to keep things interesting. There’s more to it than the gameplay video and trailer he watched. Oh, and it’s pretty damn challenging, with elements of resource managing.
Would be a nice pick after he’s done with Undertale. 


context: it’s a game that caught destiny’s attention in the beginning of today’s stream.Contrapoints just spent 4 hours categorically explaining why this chick in a Blair White video has ignorant transphobic beliefs. What she said was so nuanced and researched. It's such a long thread im amazed she took the time to type out this essay. Buntyking comes in the reply and says "She's not transphobic" "I know her" Holy fucking shit. (Thread https://twitter.com/ContraPoints/status/963149011220799488) What Bunty walked away with https://twitter.com/realbuntyking/status/963172433460154371 DestinyTo be fair, you have to have a high IQ to understand Undertale. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of moral psychology most of the jokes will go over a typical player's head(destiny). There's also Sans' nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from the ingenious indie game The Stanley Parable, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Undertale really ARE idiots- (bet you didn't get that reference, destiny) of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humor in Sans' existential catchphrase "You're gonna have a bad time," which itself is a cryptic reference to Nintendo's 1994 RPG Earthbound. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons(destiny) scratching their heads in confusion as Toby Fox's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer monitors. What fools... how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have an Undertale tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎I don't get it? When I first played the game I was laughing along all the funny little jokes and references too the funny things that happen to us regurarely in our small lives. 

Honestly? What is this dude's problem. He's being a massive grouch like that one dude from Sesame Street. I get that he hasen't played that much of the game yet but honestly can't he just start giving out small oppinions or first impressions after having played through a couple minutes of the game? 

He hasn't even said a thing about the art style, music or character design or ANYTHING. 

I'm dissapointed, I'm sure the rest of chat is too.
I hope your roof sucks.

She's a YouTuber and has a podcast called the Vegan Vanguard. She also has a PhD in Human Geography and I thought she had a really good discussion with ContraPoints and has some really interesting takes on Veganism and Capitalism that I would absolutely love to see Destiny engage with. She talked about the sustainability and inefficiency of being a secondary consumer  (eating animals that require food to live, in order to be farmed for food), which is an argument I hadn't considered before. She has some really interesting videos critiquing capitalism and neo-liberal policy as well. 


https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCepkun0sH16b-mqxBN22ogAMarcia Clark: Mr. Annand Virk, as you've mentioned to Mr. Cochrane, you believe that your friend, Mr. Simpson is completely innocent in the murder of Ms. Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman. Am I correct?

Bunty King: Yes

Marcia Clark: Can you explain to me your reasoning to support Mr.Simpson's innocence?

Bunty King: Well, I had a chat with him on the phone while he was in the Bronco. He said he was completely innocent and it was all cool. He cleared it up with me and I trust him 100% completely.

Marcia Clark: Wait, all it takes is for him to call you and you'd believe him 100%

Bunty King: Hahaha yeah hahaha.

Judge Ito: Mr. Virk this is a serious matter do not laugh in the court of law!

Bunty King: Sorry.

Marcia Clark: So what would you make of the testimonies of Mr. Shipp, the glove found at his backyard and the blood that was found with the glove?

Bunty King: Look man, I'm just a chill marketing guy okay. I know that OJ here had some shady shit and all but I too can hear the side of the story and know some truth to it. Hey, I too can have a nice conversation with Detective Fuhrman myself and reduce some racial tension. After all, I work in marketing. I'm a pretty chill guy hehehe. Sorry for laughing Judge Ito. It's my reflexes, chill.

Judge Ito: Apology accepted. Please sit down. Ms. Cochrane, bring in your next witness. Thank You.hey, I know this place has a raging hate boner for JBP so was wondering if anyone could put me onto some good videos/links which pick apart his views? So far people here just sort of reeeee and say "he doesn't understand cultural marxism"Undertale at its core is about emotion, and I dont think destiny is really able to connect to it at the emotional level it needs. He just doesnt feel things like other people do in general.   
Of all the similar games, lisa probably would hit him harder. It takes a lot to crack destiny's emotional egg.https://twitter.com/YoRHaDestiny[We were here](http://store.steampowered.com/app/582500/We_Were_Here/) and its sequel We were here too are 2 player cooperative games that hinge on communication and problem solving skills. Your characters are trapped in separate parts of a dungeon filled with puzzles and traps that you have to cooperate to solve. The puzzles are designed for the players to be able to talk, but not see what the other sees. They remind me of [keep talking and nobody explodes](http://www.keeptalkinggame.com/), which is also fun to watch streamers play btw. 

These types of games have huge banter and funny interaction potential, perfect for Destiny's stream. They are not huge undertakings, I think each one can be completed in a night if you're not completely retarded. 

I would love to see Destiny tackle these with BadBunny or Lily or MrMouton after Undertale, and I guess after Terraria if that's really happening. 

Edit:
A couple of clips 

https://clips.twitch.tv/DirtyCuriousHawkDxCat
https://clips.twitch.tv/CooperativeSucculentCookieTBCheesePullWhile there is value in trying to accurately represent an opposing viewpoint, and that you can really only do that by directly engaging with the content of that viewpoint, that doesn't mean that you should go out and watch Sean Hannity on the radio. Some content creators are just garbage content creators, and in Hannity's case he is much more of a propagandist than an actual political commentator. By his own admission, he is a Talk show host, not a journalist. 

https://twitter.com/seanhannity/status/791132954298818561?lang=en

Sean Hannity uses this as a defense for all the conspiracy theories he'll have on his show from time to time, like the seth rich nonsense. Imagine if Destiny came out and was like yeah you guys are a fucking echo chamber thats why I listen to alex jones and seriously engage with his viewpoints about interdimensional pedophile vampires. Nobody would take Destiny seriously, and he knows that at some point there is a line that should be drawn. Where should you draw that line? That's something you have to figure out for yourself as a media consumer, but I would be more willing to engage with someone like Shapiro or someone like Peterson rather than Hannity. In short, listening to someone with opposing views just because you have this irrational fear of being wrong without knowing it is not going to actually help you stay more informed, its just going to give you an outlet to make yourself seem smart, because you're probably going to engage with weaker ideas anyway.

As a side note, the subreddit could probably do with less circlejerking, especially about Jordan Peterson. I say this to make sure I'm not dodging Destiny's point about people on the subreddit not being able to respond to actual smart people with opposing viewpoints. However, This is clearly not only what Destiny is referring to as he as cited listening to Sean Hannity specifically on the radio as a measure of his open-mindedness on multiple occasions.I encountered the most triggered Mod ever in the form of u/popartsnewthrowaway . If you want to see what got me banned here is my [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/enoughpetersonspam/comments/7x8d8j/lets_all_address_jordan_b_peterson_as_a_woman/) and my [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/enoughpetersonspam/comments/7x85m3/wtf_did_he_just_eat/du697in/) that I made before the post which he then used to insta perma ban me. 

Like if you think that is ban worthy, for transphobia no less, then maybe you should not be a Mod. Like making fun of Peterson because he doesn't want to use other peoples pronouns and turning that around on him by calling him a different pronoun than he prefers, is trans phobic now? Any German memers here? The diarrhea tsunami against the grand coalition on German social media blows my mind. I'd just like to know, is opposing the grand coalition between Conservatives and Social Democrats legitimately a good idea? Because most of the criticism I saw was either extremely knee-jerk "GROKO NEVER DOES ANYTHING RIGHT" or anti-neoliberal circlejerking.Like his content, think he is a smart dude, but arrogant is a really good word to describe his... idk, aura I guess?Whats the plan boisCan DesTINY watch an embedded systems lecture series?

LETS GET EM BOYS REEEEEEEEEEEEEI literally cant watch their podcasts and videos anymore, not only is he in a severely unfunny phase with all his content, but also in a severely cringy political brainwash phase, pushing it during all his appearances. How can these retards go even deeper into that rabbit hole during a fucking Trump presidency.  
  
Fucking REE. Just a friendly reminder to everyone that whenever there is a r/livestream post involving Destiny post the link in the discord so we can all brigade it and spam upvote and downvote any chads who drop truthbombs in the comments /sHey, so I recently got into some of Destiny's videos after seeing his stream with Dr. Layman. I've seen him mention his rejection of Free will quite frequently. Does he reject the reason-responsiveness case for Free will as argued by Nozick, Fischer etc and if so does he completely reject the idea of moral responsibility and agency?

P.S No this is not about Sargon and black people.Quite a fun game when I played it and I saw during his Undertale stream he mentioned how it looked super fun to him. Think he will be playing it or has he already been and I've just missed it?I was watching desinty's old abortion stream and I'm mostly anti-abortion as you will see. But I disagree with destiny about the status of fetuses basically "whether they have the human quality". I also disagree that there is nothing that separates killing a fetus to killing a child. I think that you can easily distinguish between killing a one day baby and a baby born 2 days prior.  

So here is my reasoning:

Firstly we have to look at the situation, we have the mothers right to bodily autonomy at conflict with the fetuses right to life. So the question is whether the fetus is a being were the non-aggression principle should apply i.e your rights end were anothers begin. 

But we disregard this principle for many forms of lower life e.g. if an anorexic put a tape worm inside them we think it is right that our bodily autonomy supersedes the tape worms. I use this example as the women intentionally placed the being inside her, so I think it is an apt analogy.

The question is where is that point, I would say that humans are distinct from animals. Such a distinction comes from consciousness. Consciousness is what separates humans from all animals, as it allows us to have a higher state of thinking and empathy for each other, it is what allowed us to build society. Humans are conscious and animals are not, fetuses are not conscious. Thus the rights between humans and animals are different and when we are dealing with such an intimate form of bodily autonomy i.e. controlling whats inside you, I think it fine to use a clear standard. So I don't think the non-aggression principle is applied here.

Whilst when looking at a child outside the womb even though they are not conscious yet, we are dealing with a different set of conflicting rights, as the mother's bodily autonomy is fundamentally different as the child is no longer inside her. So because you are no longer acting on your own body or a being inside your own body, it's a lesser form of bodily autonomy. So, I think that as we protect animals from being killed e.g. dogs, cats and others you can't kill a child outside the womb.

This is why I could see abortion being justified, although I think this neglects time. The reason murder is different to assault is because you are stopping their future. People's present is always gone, people always live for the future be that 1 second, 1 day, 1 week, 1 year. So you are taking away a possible conscious life, so if the fetus has a reasonable chance of becoming conscious then you are taking away that conscious future. 

Thus,  my standard is if the being has a reasonable chance of becoming conscious then it is unacceptable to abort the life. So the unfortunate consequence is that as time progresses and technology improves earlier and earlier abortions will become illegal as the chance of becoming sentient increases.


I think destiny nailed everything else like I don't see the child will have a bad life as a good argument and destiny is the only person on YouTube that knows anything about basic statistics. But I just wanted to see what you dudes thought and whether you think I'm right or destiny.Destiny can you export your bookmarks for the youtube music folder?

Optionally does anyone have most/all of the songs?
Hello to hopefully Destiny and whoever else is reading this.  Recently on-stream Destiny engaged in some economic talk where I might be able to add/correct a few things.  This is the link to the vod when he starts talking about economic stuff.  https://www.twitch.tv/videos/223693060?t=04h24m40s but I will mainly talk about the monetary policy related stuff

&amp;nbsp;


I am currently a first-year masters student in economics with an B.S. in Econs and a minor in Stats. Therefore, I feel I can speak on this subject.  Now I can be wrong and am willing admit it but for the mother of fucking god if you think I’m wrong on something either A) Link a credible source backing up what you say B) State that you have at least an undergrad in economics C) Fuck off

&amp;nbsp;


Going to start off with some general background information.

The Fed = US central bank

Congress orders the Fed to pursue stable prices and maximum sustainable employment, if you ever hear anyone say the dual mandate this is what they are talking about.  In practice how this works out is the Fed tries to flatten out the [business cycle](https://tce-live2.s3.amazonaws.com/media/media/aee6a370-ac27-4208-ba91-dd8267aeb171.png) so our economic activity matches the long term trend . They want to push down on the peaks and push up the troughs.  
 
&amp;nbsp;


The Fed achieves these goals through monetary policies that fall into either conventional and unconventional. The first and main conventional policy is the federal funds rate(FFR).  This is when the Fed does open market operation to buy (or sell) short-term government bonds to lower (or raise) short-term interest rates. The FFR is connected to other interest rates in the economic so this is how the Fed exerts its influence. Because this is not something they can set at an exact rate the FFR is given a range.  Currently it is 1.25%-1.50% with the effective FFR being [1.42%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFF ).  Now if an economic is in a trough (recession/depression) the Fed should move to low interest rates as this should boost demand (i.e. investment and consumption) keeping us from falling into a [deflationary spiral](https://snbchf.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/DeflationarySpiral.png).   If the economy is going through a peak(boom) then the Fed should raise interest rates to decrease demand as the economy is most likely overheating. 


&amp;nbsp;


 The discount window is the second conventional policy and is more straight forward. The discount window is how the Fed directly loans to commercial bank who may need cash in the short term.  This ability is why the Fed is known as the lender of last resort. This is the job of most Central Banks just not sure if they all use the name discount window.

&amp;nbsp;

There is an issue with conventional monetary policy called the zero lower bound problem where a central bank has FFR at or near zero and the economy still decreasing in GDP or not growing as fast as we would like. Because at 0% buying more short-term bonds doesn’t decrease the short-term interest rate any more this is when we must turn to unconventional methods to save the day. While there are many unconventional policies the main one I will focus on is quantitative/credit easing as this what Destiny was talking about.  

&amp;nbsp;


Quantitative easing (QE) and credit easing (CE) are two different things. What Japan did from 2001 to 2006 is called QE, what the Fed did from 2008-2014 is called CE.  This is directly from Chairman Ben S. Bernanke [himself](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20090113a.htm), check under Credit Easing versus Quantitative Easing. Mechanically QE and CE are the same thing but the how they play out and are planned is important. In case of QE the central bank sets a target for the quantity in bank reserves.  In CE case the central bank is setting a lower then current target for one or more variable rates within the market (e.g. corporate bonds rate, long term government bonds rate, MBS, etc) and it will spend money targeted to lower these rates.


If you want more information about this, [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrKw-SLzNrw&amp;feature=youtu.be)

&amp;nbsp;





Now there just a general misunderstanding with Destiny and what QE(CE) is. From the sounds of it Destiny is only familiar with QE and he might know something about how they control rates in some way. Please let me say that this isn’t to criticize Destiny but to inform him and his viewers.  The central banks aren’t something that is well understood, and it is understandable that if you don’t investigate them you won’t understand why and how they do stuff.

&amp;nbsp;


Start listening here for Destiny’s [example](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/223693060?t=04h34m30s) then continue reading.    I’m going to edit his example a little bit to make it more realistic also let’s start with an economy with no central bank either.  We keep the base of 10 people paid $10/day, so the business pays $100/ day but now we change it so when the economy crashes the business is stuck with $60/day so now they only have 6 people at $10 a day.  


In our counterexample we have a central bank.  Same base 10 $10/day.  This time when the economy collapses the central bank steps in. Now whether through lower the FFR, QE, CE, or whatever other tool they want their goal is to decrease how much the demand falls by. In our business example if the central bank is successful then instead of getting $60/day we will be at 70, 80, or 90 a day. This leads to less people being laid off, less people being laid off means more people will still be consuming therefore more overall demand in the economy compared to the first example. 


So, while Destiny kind of started off right in his example he went off the rails when he started talking about inflation to devalue wages.  While yes inflation may happen, this is more because of how much central banks are scared shitless of deflation in their currency. No one wants to follow Japan in their Lost Score. 

&amp;nbsp;

I think this is enough for now and at least enough to get our feet wet.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask I will try and answer them.  If you have any issues relating directly to the substance of this post please follow A, B, or C and post it.  If you have any issue with organization, spelling, etc. I apologize I don’t normally write posts like this, but I hope to get better! I might try a post of the government creating jobs meme if anyone is interested.

Edit:  Destiny doesn't think there is a difference between saying the intent of QE(CE) is to decrease wages of the workers and me saying that that the intent of QE(CE) is to increase overall demand to prevent higher unemployment.  [Here is the link](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/229784894?t=05h41m23s) . If the vod is deleted here it is in Destiny's words. I listened to the vod at half speed to gather this " I don't remember... I remember reading this sounded like I was wrong on some like..on some like some like wording or something but I don't think i was wrong completely I don't remember this o my god I really don't care. I'll read this after if this is triggering you so badly. Holy Shit". 


&amp;nbsp;

He says he doesn't care but if you look at him [asking for any](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/223693060?t=04h36m50s) econ-memers to correct him he must care to some degree? Also as when Destiny who says that he will bow to evidence (that I linked) or to someone who is educated in the [subject](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/229213659?t=02h01m18s) he says he will give up and say he is wrong and change his position but yet he doesn't.  I have to question him on all his ideas and facts cause in this case he simply refuses that there is any difference between his current position and any other position.  
Tbh i feel like it’s Mexico, we live right by one of the largest and best trafficking countrys for guns, also drugs. I don’t even think that gun laws would help becuase literally anybody could get one off the streetGenerally Destiny seems to follow the scientific consensus, but for some reason (because he really really wants to be able to keep his guns...?) he does not do this with guns and their effects on homicide/suicide rates. A quick google search shows data that is clearly showing that a correlation is there/ highly likely, but when the Australia example is brought up he just immediatly rejects the point and doesnt go any further into it...

* **Stuff on destiny's playlist**: We all watch destiny, so there's really not much point in posting stuff that most of us have already heard

* **Super popular stuff**: Songs don't have to be underground with only 20 views, but i'd rather avoid really popular songs that everyone has already heard of. There's no point in setting specific limits so use your judgement [](/NoTears)

* **Please limit the number of songs per post to 5**: several people suggested limiting the number of songs and I agree, it makes going through the comments easier and also requires more thought on which songs you pick

* **Try not to repost from the last thread**: Do a quick ctrl+f to see if someone already posted the song here or in the previous thread.

Just interested in learning more about the background of Steven's fanbase.Timestamp to Ethan talking about acid attacks in London.  
"Young Arab men throwing acid in peoples faces"  
https://youtu.be/yVeGBT7X-pY?t=1845  


For anyone not from the UK; It is illegal to carry a knife in public without good reason. But until the recent law changes, the same didn't apply for carrying acid. So as you can imagine, if you're in a gang or looking to protect yourself, some people turned to carrying acid.  

What the fuck does Ethan think is happening loool?  

Some stats:

Bonus meme:
500/8,000,000 people were acid attacked in London, so build a wall between us and mexico.Jordan Peterson is my Kurt Cobain.So for the last few weeks I've watched quite a few of Destiny's debates mostly out of morbid curiosity. A few of them were genuinely interesting and informative, however, my favorites quickly became the shit show ones. Are there any debates that you guys know of that aren't on his YT channel? I particularly enjoyed listening to the ones with Tonka, No BS, Dick Masterson, etc. Just wondering if there's any shit-show debates on another platform that I'm missing. Thanks![2018-02-16 00:31:45 UTC] Mannekino: DId Destiny tell me to kill myself? I had it muted?
[2018-02-16 00:31:48 UTC] Mannekino: Did someone clip it
[2018-02-16 00:32:30 UTC] Mannekino: Entspannung time to report Destiny then if he told me to kill myself, is the new ToS in effect yet?

Really makes you think, someone deserves a permaHow do you all manage to follow the weekly or daily content of some of the more popular skeptics within the YouTube community? YouTube doesn't have a way to categorize subscriptions (which is ridiculous) so you'd have to go directly to the channels or see what's new in your feed (which I hate because they always recommend shit I don't watch).

In terms of time management alongside news, podcasts, work, hobbies, and whatever the fuck else...how do you maintain your following of even just 2-3 skeptics? Do you mainly pay attention to Destiny, and get a glimpse of each one of YouTube's sexy skeptic stars when they grace him with a conversation? 

I for one, have a tough time rolling through my Twitter feed for news along with /r/news, and YouTube. I'm wondering if anyone here even manages to listen to more than a few select wise YT leaders. It takes days to get through a proper amount of videos posted by Layman, Destiny, Styx, etc.

I like the things he does but sometimes I wish he would do slightly less of the bad things. Then I would be slightly happier some of the time.

You know that one thing he did that one time? Yah it was pretty great. It was probably one of my favorite things he did, it had an incredible impact on me both intellectually and even spiritually. It really changed my life, made me a better man.

It's why I'm such a fan of Destiny. I mean sometimes he'll say a thing on twitter and then it may or may not cause some sort of reaction but that's okay. Because in the end he's a guy that does things and that's the only thing really that matters. He's a guy, in a certain geographical place, and I find that respectable. Of the ten or so streamers I watch he is probably one of the ones I enjoy watching, if not more so than some of the others.





I can't stand league. The only reason I'll watch is because he's duo queued with someone (usually not MrMouton). So sometime's I'll bear with it to either get to some memes.

Every time, however, Steven is walking down lane or waiting to back or whatever and he pulls up the fucking mobile shit game I just want to close the stream. It's hard enough for me to get into the game but when I can't get information like kill score, minimap, etc because Destiny is grinding freemium garbage, its impossible.

This came to a head today when Steven pretty much completely ignored terraria, something I genuinely thought he'd be interested in, to pull up his daily's or whatever and ended up dying to enemies he ignored. Any attention I had on the stream was instantly broken.

Does anyone actually enjoy any of the time he spends on that game? It honestly feels like a fucking cancer that creeps into everything he plays. Like he doesn't give anything meaninful attention anymore if he can just distract himself with the meaningless bullshit that is a freemium game.

Ok end rant. Just had to get that out there.And Nier. Going to be a great quarter for the Marketplace of the games Destiny plays. Now if he just makes a fan server for Minecraft with a monthly cost he can maximize the profits he makes from his fanbase.As a longtime watcher of JRE and with the recent shooting, I think they could have an interesting and topical conversation about some of the things that have happened recently, where Destiny has an unique take on it compared to many others + personal experience. Topics could include:  
- recent school schooting  
- White supremacist / alt-right involvement  
- NRA / Gun control / 2nd amendment  
- Destiny's twitter deplatforming as result of rightwingers  
- Free speech and responsible platforming  
- Engaging with alt-right/lite  
  
Apart from that, it could be one of the things that could get Destinys twitter back. I remember when Jordan Peterson "lost" his google account, Joe made a big deal out of it on his podcast as well. [I called it ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/7rtb8w/comment/dszhqhs?st=JDQ3EUPW&amp;sh=60a0f50a)I know somebody else [uploaded the NieR gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyW7QW97Ri7aEI2xzAVGShDLZH6L5OFDw), but it would be nice to have all the gameplay vods in one place. Especially with Terraria starting, that's perfect idle youtube content. I know he doesn't want to spam up his channel, but a lot of people resolve this by creating a second channel for long uploads and twitch vods.For those without the time to go through the indictment itself, here are several interesting and surprising takeaways from it from Special counsel Robert Mueller's indictments for those without the time to go through them themselves:

- The Russians didn’t just support Trump and try to denigrate Hillary Clinton — they also supported Bernie Sanders (ostensibly as a way to further thwart Clinton). The indictment says the operatives were told to “use any opportunity to criticise Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump — we support them).”

- They tried to encourage black voters in particular to support Green Party candidate Jill Stein.

- The Russians worked to smear other Trump opponents, including Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.

- The Russians organized rallies against Trump just to sow political discord in the country. In fact, they held two rallies in New York — one “show your support for President-Elect Donald Trump” and the other “Trump is NOT my president” — on the same day.

- The Russian operatives recruited and paid actual Americans to “engage in political activities, promote political campaigns, and stage political rallies” — but, again, the indictment makes clear that these Americans did not know that they were communicating with Russians. They thought they were just grassroots activists from the US.

- The Russians were told to gin up “political intensity” in the US by “supporting radical groups, users dissatisfied with [the] social and economic situation and oppositional social movements.” To do so, they created social media pages on Facebook and Instagram around issues including immigration, religion (particularly Islam), and the Black Lives Matter movement.

- The operatives purchased ads on Facebook to promote allegations of voter fraud by Clinton and the Democrats.’

taken from the article: https://www.vox.com/2018/2/16/17020948/russia-indictments-special-counsel-trump-unwittingThis new wave of conservatism on YouTube and other placers is rooted within angry white men and women who felt left behind by society and who are afraid of others. These people need a community and fathers figures to cope. I don't want to go full Jordan Peterson but these people are committed to being in an abusive relationship.

I've watched Jordan's views on Milo and others and there is a pure correlation between an abusive father or lover and this wave of new conservatism. We all know Milo doesn't stand for anything, we know that he specifically tried to make white nationalism more appealing by working with the dailystormer. But Jordan claim that this man is a good guy and is needed for times of crisis. 

People like Milo, Gavin McInnes, and others  are a walking contradiction towards their own beliefs but are forgiven because they feel hurt and wronged by LGBT, Women, Liberals, and anyone who disagrees with their false pretenses of true justice they will accept them. The commonality of the far right personalities are that they're drunkards, lovers of men and money and thieves. Take Milo's fake scholarship fund. All sins of the father will be forgiven despite the inequities of the man, if he transgresses against the sinners and their enemies.
 

Feel my shock In this post I will address a few topics that have been discussed on the stream in the past. My aim is to bring arguments from perspectives I’ve not heard from on the stream before. 

**Mathematical structure of a portal universe**

The way I approached the portal question was by first considering the topology of a universe that has an active portal. A topological space is a set with additional structure know as topology, which essentially determines which points in the space are close to one another, which mappings are continuous and, in particular, which parts of the space are connected to each other. The relevance of this structure should be obvious since a portal essentially connects two regions of space and, therefore, changes the topology. There is a canonical way of connecting different parts of a space or different spaces together in topology known as gluing. In order to obtain the topology of the portal universe we can consider the two portal-shaped sets in the initial [Euclidean space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_coordinate_space) and then define an [equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation), which pairs each point in one portal set with the corresponding point in the other. Given an equivalence relation, one can define what is called the quotient space with respect to the relation to obtain a topological space where each collection of related points in the initial space is just one point in the quotient.

In order to be able to consider dynamics in the quotient space, we also need the additional structure of a [smooth manifold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold). As most of the readers probably know, the basic idea behind differentiable functions is that they behave like linear functions when we restrict the function to sufficiently small domain; analogously, a manifold is a topological space that behaves like an Euclidean space when we consider a sufficiently small part of it. This local similarity relation is defined with a collection of mappings known as charts, which belong to a class of invertible mappings known as [homeomorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeomorphism). For a smooth manifold we additionally require that certain compositions of charts and their inverses are [smooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothness) mappings. The local similarity relation allows us to consider the dynamics of a particle on the manifold by solving the dynamics in an Euclidean space and then using the inverse of the chart to obtain local dynamics on the manifold. The (2-)sphere S^2 and the (2-)torus T^2 are simple examples of 2-dimensional, non-trivial smooth manifolds. Longitudes and latitudes on a 2-sphere can be thought of as images of Euclidean coordinates under the inverse chart in the neighborhood of a point on the equator.

Given an arbitrary equivalence relation on a smooth manifold, the quotient space might not inherit the smooth structure if the relation is not well behaved. In our case we can define the relation by identifying points related by a fixed [diffeomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeomorphism) between the two embedded submanifolds we want to glue together. If our glued sets are solid ellipses like the in-game portals, the quotient space won’t even admit manifold structure. However, this problem can be fixed with a minor adjustment: if we consider ellipsoids instead of ellipses, we can use a generalization of the [connected sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_sum#Connected_sum_along_a_submanifold) to glue the sets together in a way that preserves the smooth structure. The ellipsoid can be arbitrarily flat, so there’s essentially no difference from physics perspective. It turns out that the smooth structure inherited from the initial space does not admit geometry with zero global curvature in the quotient space, but all of the curvature can be concentrated to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the portal.

The diffeomorphism by which the two sets are related through in the initial space can be chosen to be a composition of a reflection and an [Euclidean transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_transformation) with parametric dependence on time.  In the setting of the portal question this dependence would be linear, but we can consider any smooth dependence. Some or all of the global symmetries of the initial space are broken upon the gluing based on the properties of the transformation; in the setting of the portal question all are broken.

A lot of the arguments I’ve heard on for the answer B have been relying on Newtonian mechanics, and the arguments for answer A seem to appeal to conservation laws. Under certain conditions, Newton’s laws can be derived from a more general framework known as the [action principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_action), which allows for the use of one of the most central mathematical theorems in all of theoretical physics, [Noether's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem). The theorem states that a quantity is conserved by the dynamics if and only if the action is invariant under a group of differentiable symmetries related to that quantity. For example, Energy conservation corresponds to time translation invariance and momentum conservation to spatial translations. It only makes sense to talk about action being invariant under a transformation if it is a symmetry of the spacetime at least locally. The lack of conservation laws invalidates the arguments for answer A.

Most of the arguments for answer B have not been much better since the condition under which Newtonian mechanics can be derived from the action principle is the existence of the very same symmetries that the conservation laws required. Even in axiomatic Newtonian mechanics the Newton’s laws can only be applied in inertial frames, whose definition doesn’t even make sense in a spacetime regions without [Galilean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_transformation)/[Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_group) symmetries.

One also has to be careful about argument regarding relative velocity since, unlike in linear spaces, the velocity of a particle on a manifold is not an element of the manifold but an element of the [tangent space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_space) at that point. Therefore, comparing velocities at different points is a non-trivial problem to which there is no unique solution in the general case. A vector at a point on a manifold can be “parallel transported” along a path to another point; the result, however, depends on the curvature along that path. For instance, transporting the velocity of the cube in the problem via the portal would result in a velocity corresponding to answer B, whereas transporting it along a path not going through a portal would result in velocity corresponding to A.

Free dynamics of a particle correspond to a uniform motion in every local coordinate frame, which matches the answer B. For observers outside the local coordinate frame, however, the dynamics can look very different, but in those cases any apparent acceleration can be explained by the time dependent spatial geometry much like in general relativity.

**Interpretations of quantum mechanics**

Quantum theories can roughly be put into two categories: first quantized and second quantized. First quantized theories are semi-classical theories such as what is commonly taught at introductory courses to quantum mechanics. The word semi-classical refers to the characteristic that these theories are only partly quantum mechanical; for instance, measurement devices and interaction fields are described classically. Obviously, it is completely arbitrary what is considered classically and what is not in these theories.
Second quantized theories, on the other hand, are fully quantum mechanical and do not contain discontinuous behavior such as the collapse of the wave function. For example, quantum field theories and string theories are second quantized, including the ones used to model modern particle physics experiments.
What are commonly known as interpretations of quantum mechanics are nothing more than futile attempts at forcing human intuition into abstract mathematical models. These interpretations concern only first quantized theories and make absolutely no sense in the context of second quantization. First quantized theories can be good effective theories in certain contexts, but trying to draw some deep understanding from them seems quite unproductive when there are more fundamental theories around.
 
**Ethics**

What I discuss in this section only concerns ethics and not what the rules of a society should be. Destiny, in particular, seems to conflate the two quite often.
Abortion is a topic which has been discussed on the stream quite a few times but I’m yet to actually hear a logically coherent justification for Destiny’s stance. Based on what I’ve heard his moral stance can be summarized fairly well in the following syllogism:
Killing humans is immoral.
Embryos are human
Therefore, killing embryos is immoral.
This can be formalized as follows: B -&gt; C; A -&gt; B; therefore, A -&gt; C.

However, Destiny has insisted on multiple occasions that an individual’s stance on the topic would entirely depend on whether they define embryos to be human. This is a fallacy of the form A -&gt; B, therefore, A -&gt; C; I would expect this kind of fallacy from a person who finds the falsehood of the premise B -&gt; C inconceivable. What makes the stance quite baffling is that he’s made statements that contradict that premise in its most general form: in particular, he has stated that killing a human would be justified in certain circumstances such as when they violate what he considers his fundamental rights.

Thinking that the first premise is true would require just senselessly assigning morals to an arbitrary label of human/person, which is fallacious in the context of a more fundamental axiomatic system, since if elements of a set have a certain property, assigning the name of that set to a superset of it in no way makes the property hold for all elements of the superset. In other words, there is no reason to think that including embryos under that label would change the morality of killing them.

In the context of abortion discussions, Destiny also tried to argue for immorality of killing someone (an embryo) by saying things like “I would not like to have been killed”, which makes no sense since a dead person cannot be anything but indifferent about being dead; and “I like living” which, given the implication that being dead would somehow be bad/worse, is a fallacy of the form (A -&gt; B) -&gt; (not A -&gt; not B). I personally have never heard a solid argument why anyone should care about their own death from purely egotistical perspective. The death of an individual can obviously have significant impact on other people, which alone can be reason enough to consider death as something unwanted in society.

Destiny’s black-and-white view of morality has also come up in discussions about veganism. The argument that he’s used multiple times in favor of veganism is that separating humans from other animals into disjoint sets is not feasible using some characteristic such as intelligence; this is an obvious case of the continuum fallacy. It shouldn’t be difficult to make such a dichotomy between species like chicken and humans, and most of the other commonly used animals in cuisine tend to fairly unintelligent as well. There is, of course, a gray area with certain octopi, cephalopods and such, but the morality of using them as food should have nothing to do with clearly unintelligent species.

Many of Destiny’s flimsy moral beliefs seem to come down to his speciesist position, which obviously makes sense from the perspective of evolutionary psychology but is axiomatically based on a completely arbitrary definition and, therefore, groundless in the context of a more fundamental ethical framework.

edit:
The reason for the lengthy nature of the portal section is that I don't want anyone to just believe in my conclusion, but rather, my aim is to provide sufficient information such that even someone who doesn't have much experience in mathematics might be able to understand what I'm claiming and why. I can try to further elaborate on the details if anyone is interested.
Im gonna be honest i was watching the olympics with the stream on in the background and then i dozed off it was something about not calling your friend a rat or some shit???Destiny has mentioned research about free trade, immigration, and determinism during his debates with people like Sargon, naked ape, trump supporters etc. All these topics interest me, and i'd like to learn more about them. I'm not sure what studies or research he's referring to however. I'd really appreciate someone helping me. *I felt a separate post was appropriate, but this is obviously related to Destiny's video about NRA being worse than any terrorist organization in America. In part because I was late to the post and also because it's about a specific topic in the video.*

**3.2 million teachers** in public elementary and secondary schools in America according to statistics from some government website. Yearly total budget around $600 billions for reference.

I'm an European overlord so I have no clue about buying guns, but I'm assuming that these guns would somehow be bought in bulk, so looking up the single-purchase price of a Glock online would probably give an unfair estimation.

According to some survey American police departments spent around $30-40 per officer for a four or five year period (can't remember which), but presumably those were service guns and the cost is for maintenance and arming new officers. It wouldn't be comparable to arming 3.2 million teachers.

Couldn't find to much on costs for training and regular practice at a shooting range, and what amount of that would be needed. The police department survey said the spending on ammo for that period was around $200 per officer and I'm assuming that a decent chunk of that goes straight to the shooting range.

**Can anyone make a better estimate for the price of a good service gun for teachers, that can then give us an estimated cost to arm 3.2 million teachers?**

For further discussion, what other public and private facilities would need a similar arming of workers? Colleges too? Should we look at other parts of society as well? 

How would you deal with the stress for teachers knowing that they would absolutely be shot first in the case of a school shooting?

How would schools preventing a teacher shooting an innocent student who had been misidentified as a shooter? It's not going to require many instances (one is probably enough) before people are up in arms.

***As a final word, when Destiny gets destroyed in debates like this one with the NRA, it's not the time and place to meme about it. Help him Debatiny.***I know the subreddit isn't supposed to be circlejerking as much anymore, so I think its a good opportunity to try to introduce the kinds of arguments that Destiny wanted. Until today, I was completely ignorant on the concept of ableism, and I admit my first impression is something like "well why is ableism bad? shouldn't we reward achievement?" Of course, that has nothing to do with ableism, and I encourage anyone still ignorant of it to do some pretty basic research, and maybe watch Stella Young's ted talk on the subject. This got my noggin joggin and made me think back to JF. The counterclaim that JF's defenders often made was "well, do you want disabled people not to be able to be in relationships, thats pretty ableist isnt it?" This is kind of the new DAE liberals are the real racists but rebranded. The thing is, theres more to JF's story than just the mental capacity of the girl, even though I admit that just exacerbates the story to a point of indefenisbility among people actually considering the situation.

At this point, I have to break and explain a term called "appearance of impropriety" which is a term I came across when learning to be a teacher. The idea is essentially that doing things that are unessential to the task at hand but essential to predatory tasks are wrong in and of themselves. So as an example, if I'm a bio teacher and one of my students is stuck at school and they cant contact their parents or legal guardians to get home, I would personally be very tempted to give them a ride. However, this actually turns out to be a very bad thing to do. While I know I'm not going to engage in predatory behavior, by allowing what I'm doing, I'm giving actual molesters a legitimate window of opportunity they can use to prey on kids. The act of giving a student a ride home is non-essential to the task of teaching, but is one of the main ways a teacher would violate a student. One of the unfortunate side effects is that you can't really build friendships with your students outside of class, but again that is not essential to teaching but is essential to being a predator, therefore it is wrong regardless of my personal intention because if acceptable, actual predators use that opportunity for malicious purposes. Just another example of a few bad people ruining it for all the rest of us I suppose.

So let's go back to JF. With "appearance of impropriety" in mind, things start to sound really bad for him. First, he begun a relationship with someone who has never held a job, and has always lived with her parents. For her whole life, she has been dependent on other people for her survival and there is no indication she will be independent anytime soon. Then, after beginning the relationship, he convinces this woman to move from texas to north carolina, a trip long enough that it would take a complete day to drive. This physical distance ensures that the people taking care of her previously would be unable to directly interfere in day to day life for her and JF. Then, and here's where it gets really nasty, he attempts to impregnante this woman. When women have kids and they dont have jobs, they become very dependent on the men they are with to provide for them. After all, its not just the women at risk at that point, the life of their child, which they have a biological affinity towards, is in jeopardy. While all this is going on, JF is saying stuff like "I am the only one who can see into her mind." Now, I want to give JF a bit of credit here, so bear with me. JF may be a complete beast in bed, maybe the woman loved the sex. JF may have taken very good care of her, and provided for her amply. JF may have been a better caretaker than both of her parents combined. JF may have had absolutely zero malicious intentions and truly would have been the best possible person for this girl to have been with. Maybe JF really is the only person in the world who sees the complete value that this girls mind has. Even if ALL the above is true, JF is at BEST giving predators an innocent shield in which they can engage in predatory behavior, and at worst, is a predator himself. So really, whats the difference?

JF could have chosen to move out to texas, gotten to know her parents, hell, at least spoken at length with her parents, he could have chosen to wait to have a child with her for a few months to make sure she liked her recent living arrangements, he could have chosen to interact with women who were more independent in the first place. Yet, JF consistently made decisions that made him indistinguishable from a predator, someone looking to subjugate a woman for himself and his desires. If a teacher starts giving kids rides home, entering their rooms in private to tutor them, hangs out with them every day at dave and busters to play pump it up, then what is the difference between that teacher and a teacher who does start relationships with their students?

I think Destiny missed a huge opportunity here to open a broader discussion into ableism, consent, and the term "appearance of impropriety" here by engaging too much on the drama side of the problem, but I think that andy and JF are mad enough still that Destiny could still do this, and if you liked my argument and found it reasonable, I urge you to please use your youtube platform in order to give the best argument you can as to why this behavior is wrong. Starting this august, I'm going to finally be a biology teacher in high school, and I don't want this PREDATOR to have anything to do with the field of study I teach. Because if you engage in predatory behaviors, then by definition, you are a Predator JF. If you are going to sue Steven Bonnell II, then you better sue Lance Edward Gunnin Jr as well.

I could also talk about how hypocritical this guy is because of how reliant he is on the state to intimidate and bully people, but constantly talks about how the state is authoritarian. That talk however, is a story for another day.
Anyone remember/have link to that video Destiny was watching on stream a few months back about empathy and compassion? I think it was a neurology meme.Let me know why. What do you find appealing about her?

There was, I believe, a discussion or debate that Destiny had with someone who made the meme of saying "the polls were wrong" and then Destiny went into explaining the difference between polls and projections. It may even have been a single video that was dedicated to this topic. In any case, I'm trying to find that video of where Destiny talks about that and goes through the differences. Does anyone have the title or link to that video? I can't seem to find it.He's not even scratched the surface of the game yet and I'm so excited to see him progress further into the game.

FeelsBadManCopypasting the YouTube description because it pretty much nails it but also I'm lazy:

&gt;An excellent six part series which examines modern life and considers the impact of our relentlessly changing world upon key values that used to make western society something to aspire to.
Each episode is packed with pearls of wisdom and a lot of food for thought. Concepts are well presented with rational arguments and good examples - helping to justify the often disappointing new realities it reveals.

&gt;Join Pria Viswalingam for the new six-part documentary series, Decadence, as he considers whether we are now completely bogged down in a mire of meaningless self-indulgence, and whether we do really need iPods, plasma screen TVs, Brazilian waxes and self-navigating 4WDs to achieve happiness. He asks if family incomes have never been higher in the western world, property values are soaring, if conspicuous consumption and material wealth have never been so evident, why are we so unhappy?

Humans are the fucking top land predator animal on this earth and very good sea predators and have been for hundreds of thousands of years. Our deltoids (shoulders) have been [specifically evolved to throw spears at animals](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12267) before homo sapiens was even a thing. Our ancenstors' switch to eating meat allowed us to have [larger bodies, have more children](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-23061016) (inb4 JF), [made us smarter](https://www.npr.org/2010/08/02/128849908/food-for-thought-meat-based-diet-made-us-smarter), [and gave us the ability to talk](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/03/09/469676852/chew-on-this-slicing-meat-helped-shape-modern-humans). 

We have an unique perspiration system, that [allows us to traverse huge distances over land in order to exhaust our prey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=826HMLoiE_o). 

We have [huge asses](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/health/27well.html), to the point where the glute muscles are the biggest in our body, and of which most muscles only activate when we run, not walk.

[&gt;b-b-but we don't have no large canines and claws though!!1
](https://i.imgur.com/yatVxEy.png)

This is such an incredibly flawed argument I don't understand how you can make it. Humans don't need large canines and claws, because we have fucking tools that allow us to slice meat, slaughter animals, and so on. For the same reason we don't need a herbivorous digestive system. We use tools to cook the plants before we digest them and so we don't need to chew for fucking 8 hours a day.

Humans mainly thrived on meat, [so much so that selective pressure on the enzyme that allows us to process tubers, roots and starches only started to happen around 10.000 years ago \(start of agriculture\).](http://dnapunctuation.org/~poptsova/course2012/Perry.pdf)

Anyone still claiming ridiculous things such as "humans are predisposed to being a vegan/vegetarian", "humans are herbivores", "humans only eat meat when they have to", is just as bad as a climate change denier, holocaust denier, or creationist. They should be banned from chat and subreddit tbh.And I'm not just talking about Republicans, Democrats and American left-wingers and even Destiny himself also seem to love their precious guns too much to let them go; all I hear talk from these people is that they only want to 'ban assault rifles' like AR15 but leave other firearms like handguns alone, along with 'tighter gun control', rather than go all the way and banning all firearms and firearm ownership from civilians out right like every other country in the world that doesn't have thousands of gun deaths per year and mass shootings every week.[This](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/04/a-thrivesurvive-theory-of-the-political-spectrum/) blog post lays it out.  
In reference to [this](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/229427247?t=10m06s).That could make for some good memes.I thought it would be sweet with a compass with all the political youtubers on. Do we know where the rest of the people like JF, contapoints etc etc fits in? Can we make one?I'm on mobile and can't check, just wondering if we lost our years of VODs just before they may remove that retarded part from the TOS. 

Announcing this less than 24 hours from the TOS deadline to delete that shit is retarded though, so it's understandable if all the VODs are gone already. Hoping Steven procrastinated. Internet Blood Sports is really a big thing now and none of the "leftwing" people that get invited can debate for shit. Destiny was always /ourguy/ and debate champion but it seems like like he has miscalculated and missed out on this huge oppurtunity to put his view out in ze poblic space.

I know Destiny is hard into Terraria at the moment, I'd like to put forward a suggestion for the Post-Terraria era.

Foxhole is a top down MMO style military game. It's big gimmick is having everything being player driven. Players mine the scrap then  turn them into materials before making them into weapons and vehicles, finally distributing them to the front and using them to fight the other team.

I believe this game has a number of features that make it a strong option for Destiny's stream;

* Large servers with 100's of players means it is easy to play with/against viewers. (Maybe a negative?)

* Relatively small game with easy access to devs on their discord would allow Destiny to work with them to deal with trolls/greifers.

* Many of the tasks in the game that are vital to the success of the team, especially ones such as builder/QM, have stretches of inaction that would allow for a quick tab out to Lords Mobile

* It's pretty fun and immensely rewarding thanks to the emergent nature of the game-play.

Never really posted anything on this sub and don't know if it's allowed, just though it would be funny to share here.Firstly there's the issue of the cotton ceiling and lesbians feeling pressured to have  sex with trans women. But they don't like dick
 [A discussion can be seen here](www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/6gkezh/i_am_leaving_this_community_as_i_feel_it_is). The cotton ceiling was a legitimate hot issue as transgenders really felt that lesbians should have sex with them despite lesbians hating penis.


Older trans men who have been socialised as male for maybe 50 years transition into a woman and then they are supposed to be deferred to because they are higher on the oppression hierachy but often they still have mysoginistic tendencies an it becomes no different from a sexist man shouting women down and telling them what to do. TERFs also discuss those types of sexist transgenders co-opting their groups and pushing things like it being offensive to not call penises female.


 **MALES WITH NO TRANSITION ONLY GENDER IDENTITY DOMINATING FEMALE SPORTS** Secondly how are they "ABSOLUTELY CRAZY" for being annoyed at 14 year olds identifying as female and then absolutely dominating in athletic events. Is that not a reasonable thing to be upset about? [And it has happened multiple times](http://www.courant.com/sports/high-schools/hc-hs-cromwell-track-andraya-yearwood-0407-20170406-story.html) I don't have all the links saved but there are other instances of a mediocre male athlete who transitions without taking hormones and dominates the female athletes. [**HERE IS IT HAPPENING AGAIN, ARE TERFS CRAZY FOR OPPOSING THIS?](http://archive.is/jWYDK)



**And the most important thing of all. Please read this story posted on the "EVIL TERF" sub and tell me how that is not a legitimate thing for someone to post about. Is this woman evil and crazy?**


&gt;Hi r/GenderCritical,
I discovered this subreddit a few months back, and I felt like I was finally in the company of people who understood me. It was a complete breath of fresh air, and that's why I'm posting here for the first time, in the hopes that I can actually vent about my current situation.

&gt;I work in a "man's" environment. I do the on site analytical work on products made in a foundry. This means that I'm the only female on a rota of about 40 men, who all work in manual labour. Apart from a few hiccups, I have absolutely no problems being the only woman here. For the most part I am treated with respect, and if any comments do come my way, I don't take any shit. I know that a lot of sexual stuff gets said behind my back, but I have to pick my battles.


&gt;The nature of this work means it's filthy. When I finish a shift, I'm absolutely covered in grime and dust and have to change out of my clothes and shower. When I started working here, there were no female facilities (fair enough) but over the past 2 months I have spoken with management and they have built a female changing/shower/bathroom.
HOWEVER. A couple of months in, I was told that one of the managers was going on leave. The manager in question, a 60 year old man who works in the foundry, took off to Thailand for two months and came back "female" with a pair of breasts. We were all dragged in to a meeting and told that if we used their old name we would be sacked. If we made any "comments" we would be sacked. We were all slightly taken a back, but laughed it off and agreed to call Pete by his new name.

&gt;Last week I had just finished a shift. I headed over to the shower room, and started showering. Part way through, Pete enters the room and starts getting undressed. Straight away I was shocked, he hadn't mentioned to me that he planned on using the female facilities (he has, in 25 years of employment there, NEVER used the men's showers). I turn around to get dried and there is it - an old man's cock jiggling. I was polite enough but fucking mortified.
I have brought this up with my (male) managers. I have told them that I don't feel safe anymore, that I don't want to shower anymore. I have told them that if I wanted to get showered with men I would go and use the men's showers. I was called a bigot and told that unless I want to lose my job, I should get over my reservations and stop being offensive. I was told that "as a minority here, we thought you would know better than to pick on people".


&gt;So, r/GenderCritical, here we are. I fought for a women's bathroom and now I have to look at a wrinkly old cock while I shower. I'm genuinely scared and uncomfortable showering infront of Pete, and now I have to deal with comments from the men like "If I tuck my cock between my legs, can I come and have a look at your tits too?". Nice.


&gt;EDIT: Thank you all so much for your supportive comments. I have been scared to speak out about how I feel. I told a friend about the above scenario and their response was "This is your problem, not [Pete]'s, it's not like they fancy you". I feel like our outrage is silenced and just called "ignorance" or even "hate speech". I am actively seeking new employment, hopefully somewhere where my rights are more important than someone's later-in-life fetish. Much love to you all.



END OF THE FIRST PART--- Guess what happened to her in her update?


&gt;Hi everyone.


&gt;I made this post a short while back, about how I fought for a women's shower room at work, then had to share it with a man who has recently "transitioned", but who has kept his penis.
I'd like to say a big thank you to everyone who was so supportive. When I heard that other people shared my anger and embarrassment, I felt much more empowered about the situation. Unfortunately, the situation got worse.


&gt;Like many of you suggested, I got to work early (5 am) and installed a lock on the inside of the shower room. By 10 am it had been broken off. Am email was sent to the Laboratory computer requesting that "no employees make any structural changes to facilities which could result in a breach of fire standards".
On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday I showered at the end of my shift (2pm) as usual. Pete came in at 2:05pm each day (as usual). On Thursday I checked some emails and generally wasted time until 2:20pm. I stepped in to the shower and...you guessed it...Pete came in.


&gt;I wrote my notice that night, handed it in on Friday morning, and then self-certified myself as sick for my notice period.
I'd rather be unemployed and poor for a couple of weeks than get raped.

&gt;Thanks again, r/gendercritical. I may have lost this fight, but I don't feel like the loser here.

&gt;EDIT: I'm so sorry to have to tell the people who messaged me saying "lol have fun in poverty you bigot", but I got a new job this week! :)



That's the whole story. I honestly want to hear how people disagree with that being something legitimate to talk about. 


The terfs also argue against a lot of the crazy bullshit science radical Trans activists push for, some say that "they can have a period" and they often like to say "sex is defined arbitrarily" when it's not. 99.9% of people fit neatly into having male sex organ or female sex organs. And the genetic chromosome defects are rare and often mean indistinguishable from the normal phenotype.

It's just more Trans activists wanting to blur the line so they can feel more closer to being biologically female. Transgender people dislike you asking "if they have had the surgery" because most of them don't have it. They still have a penis, a lot of the public thinks all trans people are fully transitioned and this shapes the bathroom debate a lot.

My humble opinion on the bathroom debate is it was never an issue before Trans activists made it an issue. People were fine when they assumed transsexuals just transition  fully with surgery then use the bathroom of their new sex. What made people crazy was when the law came that ANYONE can use the bathroom of their GENDER IDENTITY. Literally what you think in your head. Meaning the law was pushed way far in the other direction, if you a woman sees someone biologically male she does not feel belongs in the bathroom she no longer has the law on her side, it's firmly on the side of ANY man who puts a dress and a wig on. Or like Danielle Muscato someone who says she is a woman but literally is a bald fat man who does not present as female in any way. And people really don't like the idea of pre-ops having their penises out in the locker room.



Anyway guys, I just want to discuss this with you. I don't agree with all the TERFs say especially the hurtful shit, I respect people like Contrapoints but I disagree with her a lot too. I just feel like you guys calling all TERFs absolutely crazy made me wonder about this subreddit. I hope you guys can discuss this as I feel these are a few strong pointsFor me, personally, I'm swearing off all relationships.

My drivers are up to date and NOX player is also up to date. I don't get any high CPU usage playing anything else than Lords Mobile or using NOX player. I tried KOplayer and Bluestacks it's the same thing there

I made a thread in "noxappplayers" own subreddit which isn't that active and someone posted this in the thread, https://www.reddit.com/r/noxappplayer/comments/7vrm2t/cryptocurrency_malware_miner_bundled_in_nox_6/   

I don't know what to think of this thread it seems like a dumb troll attempt or am i wrong?

Is anyone else having this issue? Or can someone help me? Like i have no idea what to do and it's annoying.have you screwed yet?So here's this weeks spreadsheet, just a couple things before you ask.

1. % of total time is &gt;100% because of overlap of multiple things (discussions while playing games for example)
2. If you want to sort the columns, click file&gt;download as and download the spreadsheet 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w9e036IYK38EjrldkTuBhXA90acAQ3ye7rCosrbCHnw/

Also, Hillshire has put together an awesome site related to the spreadsheet here https://infinite-cliffs-94665.herokuapp.com/ You can sort by category/topic, navigate the vod by parts, filter out parts of the stream you don't want to see, and there are links to timestamps for everything. The site searches for my post every 3 hours so this weeks spreadsheet should be on there within 3 hours from this post. *edit: it's already up

Also, here's the link to next weeks spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QrJW1ScbSeq1atnWRWBt4FuPlGuxnQXMLA3kyaTKav8/

[part 2](https://streamable.com/b6l0q)You have a lot to learn Destiny, A LOT. You need to be more humble with your approach in certain topics that go beyond shallow topics of current events and politics (easy picks, unless you don't mind looking like a complete imbecile, which I know you care, given the recent ego-trip you have been in). Just a reminder that you have spent the good part of your life barely surviving, fighting not to be homeless and wiping floors in stadiums, while most of us have been intellectually curious and dedicating our time to learn, read and listen people that are smarter than us. So either you are completely oblivious of how much information/education you have missed in the past 2 decades (and how far behind you are vs other actual intelligent people), OR you think yourself smarter than the majority, in which case I have to remind you that smart people not necessarily start questioning the world at the age of 30, certainly don't spend their 20s doing manual work and living with their parents. Forming rational thoughts is not an acomplishment, I get it you are excited because this is new to you, but most people were doing that in high school, (while passing the classes you are still completely oblivious about, like Calculus? do you even know what that is?). Be humble, you will learn more that way.﻿~~If you're interested in a semi-casual guild where it is mostly about community and just having a nice place to call "home" I'm starting that guild.

He is arguing that twitch had terminated his contract without a proper explanation as to why, and failed to give him 30 days notice - something that was apparently written into his contract 

Will be interesting to see how this plays out as it sets the precedent for other streamers to do the same. So it seems kind of strange to fly all the way to Poland, + fly out ex and child, + spent $x a month just to play a bunch of Dark Souls and LoL. The plan was to play SC2 hardcore for 3 months to see if I could be incredibly competitive when I left. If not, I'd switch off the competitive part of SC2 and either move into purely the entertainment side, or switch to a different game.

Over the course of the past few months, things have been bothering me with the progression (stagnation? regression?) of the scene. The people in the scene (casters, community figureheads, players) are completely out of touch, the community is confused and conflicted, and Blizzard is woefully inadequate.

After watching the game dwindle for quite some time, or at least not grow explosively like I'd hoped it to, I started to think about things that I could do, personally, to see some kind of growth. I thought about how people like Day9 and Husky bring people into the scene. I thought about the success of other games, like LoL and DotA 2, and what they're doing differently that could help us.

Then I thought about how I ever got into games.

I played Starcraft: Brood War for 10 years. I never played it "seriously" until the last year or so, and even at that I only made it to C+/B- by massing games at the end of a season on ICCup.

Here was my routine -

1) /f all to see which friends are online. I can see in one glance who's in a game, who's in a chat room, and who's idling/afk.

a) from here, I could go hang out with said friends in a chat channel and shoot the shit for a while. I'd also be introduced to/talk to anyone else in the channel that they'd had with them. It was a cool and incredibly laid back way to get introduced to people.

b) from here we could search for games together, no problem. Or, if we wanted to fuck around but didn't want to do it in a chat room, we could watch a replay together. If he had a funny game he wanted to show me, we could literally make the game and watch it together while chatting and laughing about it.

2) if no one was really on, I could host a game or join one that was already made. Very rarely (if ever) did I log onto b.net to grind out some 1v1's. Team games were okay, but the UMS scene was gold. "DIPLO 7.7 LAG=BAN" "2V2V2V2 BGH FREE BEER" "PHOTON D NO NOOB!!" "3V3 ZC LAG=BAN" "2V2V2V2 FASTEST NR20".

3) my favorite option, sometimes I'd head into channel sex, gay, Town Square, clan x17, clan lzh, clan sphere, or clan OD, just to fuck with people.

I met so many people through those Brood War chats. I remember one chick I met via the chats, isolationgirl. I haven't talked to her since Brood War, but I remember that we'd chat occasionally and one of the conversations we had somehow ended up on music. At the time of our chatting, my favorite bands were Shine Down, Taking Back Sunday, A New Found Glory, and 311. I also listened to a fair bit of video game music. She told me to check out a couple of bands, Pain of Salvation and Riverside. After opening me up to the world of prog, I haven't looked back since. I kind of wonder if I hadn't had been exposed at that point to other types of music (beyond what's found on the radio or talked about in school) what my tastes in music would be like today.

I remember me + Frank (a mutual friend of me and Kyle) trolling this kid online so hard, his name was "Meatwagon", we ended up getting his mom to ban him from Battle.net forever. Somehow we'd gotten his phone number and prank called him a few times, saying stupid shit to his parents (whatever 15 year olds do) when they'd finally picked up the phone.

I remember when I was 17 years old and living with my grandma and I had no ride to school because my grandma didn't drive, I literally was hanging out in a channel on U.S.East all night chatting with people and managed to stumble upon someone who lived only 30 minutes away. Looking back, that probably wasn't the safest or smartest thing I'd ever done, but hey, I was able to get to school that day.

I played quite a few games when I was younger. I remember absolutely loving Halo when it came out (OMG VEHICLES? and PLZ that last level EPIC AS FUCK). I remember loving FFVII and FFIX and hating FFVIII (junction system fuck you) and always disagreeing with Kyle about it. I loved Ocarina of Time and I cringed at the time system in Majora's Mask, but trudged through it anyway. I was absolutely fascinated by the idea of X-Box live and bought a few games to play online the first month it debuted, because playing people online using consoles was pretty much unheard of back then. Despite all of these different things going on, Brood War was a pretty central part of my life. I always found myself logging into Battle.net to hang out and chat with people.

When I compare all of these warm, fuzzy feelings to SC2, I realize that there is nothing comparable, and never will be, with the current system in place. Battle.net feels like a barren wasteland. We had to fight the developer just to get chat channels implemented, and even with them in it just doesn't feel right. There are so few lines of text that can fit, it's a pain in the ass to scroll up because any time someone hits enter the text resets, you're never even forced into a chat channel originally so you have the ability to never join one...It's just a mess. It feels absolutely terrible.

If I didn't play SC2 professionally, I could never see myself buying it. Why on Earth would I ever get a game that's so centered around this cut-throat competitive side that just doesn't appeal to most people? Fuck, even if I want to 2v2 with my girlfriend or 3v3 with a couple friends, I still get assigned a rating for it. So now, instead of fucking around and enjoying ourselves, I actually have friends that stress over winning team games? No way man, fuck that.

When I first came over to SC2, I was most excited because my two best (only?) friends were coming over with me, Joe and Kyle. I had a few friends from BW that I knew, too, who also came over. We all were in the Beta, and it was going to be super awesome because we were going to practice hard and all be professional gamers together. Just like when we watched Flash and Jaedong and all of these other guys in the OSL; that was going to be us.

Every person that I knew couldn't stand the game for more than a month. Kyle doesn't play, Joe got bored and still plays Brood War, and everyone else similarly lost interest.

This was after us being so incredibly hyped for this game that it was unbelievable. I remember sitting on AIM freaking out with a friend when SC2 was originally announced. My friend was fluent in Korean and was translating the Blizzard announcement as it was being broadcast live.

I've talked about stuff like this so much, and I know a lot of people are tired of hearing my thoughts on it by now. I'm not trying to nostalgia-fag anyone, I'm just hoping that you understand that I completely feel what it means to be a casual gamer. It's not dirty, there's nothing wrong with it, and I had more fun in that time period than at any other period in my life. Falling asleep in class because I played one too many 2v2v2v2's, sleeping in and being late to school because I really wanted to master Wizard on Ramza so I spent an hour the previous night with him in a corner screaming until I'd had enough JP to learn everything, etc...etc...

I'm pretty far removed from that, now, but I remember it, and I know what it was like. So when I see all of these other people "in the scene" speak about what we need to do to "grow the community" and "expand e-sports"...it just feels strange. It feels awkward, and alienating. It feels like I'm watching a politician on stage who's a multimillionaire saying "I know what it's like to be poor! I know what it's like to be working 60 hours a week just to make the rent!"..and all I can think is, "Man, fuck you, you don't know what it's like, stop feeding me that bullshit..."

Doa, Grubby, Artosis...all of these guys writing about the state of the metagame, or "just have hope and everything will get better!"....man, battle.net sucks, it's terrible. SC2 was supposed to be the flagship of e-sports. When SC2 came out, the foreign scene actually got involved and exploded as a result. For the first time ever there was more money to be made in the foreign scene than in Korea for Starcraft. If you'd had told anyone that 5 years ago, they'd have said it was impossible, that Korea will always be the mecca of Starcraft. Although that holds some truth today, the foreign scene still has a ton of interest.

You don't understand how angry it makes me...I've talked about it on stream before, that I cannot fucking stand politics...not because of anyone's particular views, but because it's all a big joke. These guys talk the talk, but they'll backstab you for their corporate lobbyists in a split second. Obama talks about unprecedented transparency and how the Democrats hate the Republicans for their wars and fear-mongering, yet the Patriot Act gets bipartisan support for re-approval for Congress. The Democrats have always been opposed to huge businesses getting government tax breaks, yet there was bipartisan support for the $700billion in bailout money...that all went to huge businesses. Why would a party that historically stands for "the working man" and "against big business" subsidize all of their losses with our tax money???

Sorry, this has nothing to do with politics. It's just, you don't understand how angry it makes me to hear someone like Idra talk about "Blizzard's done everything, we can't rely on them for anything, we just have to do what we can now for the scene." What the fuck, you're ready to throw in the towel, then? Battle.net will always be a barren wasteland?

Or Geoff's "The scene's doing fine, I'm getting a raise next month!".....do you think the average guy who doesn't log onto Battle.net anymore because it feels like a graveyard cares that you're getting a raise on your paycheck? Why would you even say that? What does that have to do with how the average person feels about Starcraft in any way, size, shape or form?

"You don't want to be part of this money grab, the big boys club, the e-sports gravy train? Then go back to LoL." So since the solution might be difficult or I'm acknowledging that there are problems, the only real answer is to just "fuck off" to a different game? Is that what you would tell every single fan who's tired of SC2 because the game offers nothing for the non-competitive person?

I may say some mean things, but I try to be the most inclusive guy ever. I hate cliques, I can't stand "scenes", and I love including as many people into things as possible. That's the reason why I'm the most visible person on forums like screddit and teamliquid, despite the haters/trolls. It's the reason why I make an effort to remain visible at public events and to stay and sign every single thing a person brings me, or talk to every single fan that wants a word. It's why I talk to and interact with my chat as much as possible. It's why I respond to every e-mail that's sent to me. It's why I've read almost every word said about me online, whether it's on screddit, teamliquid, or my youtube channel.

If we owe our livelihoods to the community, how can we ignore them so hard and pretend we live in a bubble that exists in a separate world from them?

So what now?

I'm not sure. I had the misfortune of speaking to a Blizzard rep, the same guy, coincidentally, that's going to give JP some "sick information". I'm pretty sure that I already know what information he's going to give him, and I know how the community will react. At first everyone will say it's pretty neat, because it gives players an incentive to play some more, but it's all still focused around "being competitive". After hearing him tell me about some of the problems that Blizzard has when dealing with some issues, I was 100% certain that nothing was going to change.

Nothing significant will change with the Battle.net interface. I've been so torn over the past few weeks whether or not I should just dump the chatlog on screddit and peace the fuck out (which is what most of you would do if you honestly saw it), but I literally promised him at the beginning of the message that I would keep everything private, and I'd feel like a scumbag for leaking it (and maybe even costing him his job? if there's enough negative blowback).

I thought about transferring to something else in SC2, such as entertaining or casting. I figure if SC2 has enough money in it to make a sustainable career in either of those, there should be enough money in it to continue streaming + training and playing.

So if that's a no-go, the next step is to switch games. The choices are then either LoL or DotA 2. As much as this community seems to love DotA 2, I honestly feel like LoL will be the bigger game for the next several years, making it the obvious choice to transfer to.

I'm not 100% switching yet; it's impossible right now for me to do it. My heart is still with SC2; I've put so much time into anything in my entire life. My marriage failed because I was too busy juggling work and school, and I flunked out of school, giving up really my last joy in life (music) trying to keep up with my 60 hours a week at a casino job, and then I even managed to lose that. SC2 is the only thing that I've been reasonably successful in, and the thought of all of the time I've put into it essentially being wasted by switching games destroys me. It's frustrating enough being "bad" at SC2, where I'm in the top .1% of players around the world, but to be "bad" in a game where I'm barely in the top 30-40% of players? It's absolutely excruciating, I almost can't even bring myself to stream the learning process and the growing pains that happen along the way.

This has been the most disorganized rambling of thoughts I've ever posted before. I thought about organizing this into a coherent something that I could post on the main screddit to try and get people united behind some changes for SC2, but I now know that Blizzard isn't really in a position to implement anything that would fix our problems. And even if they were, the main figureheads of this community are too out-of-touch with the average person to even know what they'd want, so all of the white noise would lead to nothing constructive getting done that increases the actual player base in the game.

I don't know what I'm planning on doing for the future, but right now it's really starting to look like LoL. Leaving this game is almost impossible for me, but I just don't see any other way out right now. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and thanks for supporting me by watching my stream. I promise that when I know something concretely I'll let you all know.

[Manufacturing in China is just really fucking good, it's just something that they are really good at.](https://youtu.be/Q7ihh6nTLuQ?t=818)

I understand that Destiny is probably talking about electronics when he says stuff like this, and it may be true that China produces good quality electronic stuff, but to claim that "manufacturing" in general in China is good is probably wrong.

Chinese manufacturing is cheap, but it's not good. Just from my own experience I can tell you that Chinese manufacturing often produces [poor quality steel](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-17/safety-warning-over-fabricated-chinese-steel/6949506), [asbestos being exported from China]( https://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/china-ignores-who-warnings-in-asbestos-boom/news-story/e50822ffb53cb79df85badffde13ca2c)in construction materials etc.

Does anyone know about other areas of Chinese manufacturing? I've mentioned electronics and construction... what other sectors of Chinese manufacturing are there and are they considered "good"?... I really enjoyed the IRL streams with badbunny. a lot of creep shots of bunnies legs n ass with those tights on, really good IRL streams. Appreciate it.\o&gt;

If you wanna hate the white people, just make a distinction  
No one that I call a friend has ever owned a slave  
Got no patience for Nazis, I think they're better off dead  
  
Okay, he's fire but we lit the flame, he's siphoning gas  
Fuck anyone who labels me as that because of my family genetics  
For things I didn't do and decisions I didn't make  
  
Acknowledging atrocities were wrongly committed  
Learn from mistakes and you will do better  
Learn from mistakes and you will do better  
  
Refuse to let you blindly hate my wife or my baby  
Everyone letting history perpetuate the hatred within

Acknowledging atrocities were wrongly committed  
Tom seems cool but the message wasn't delivered correctly  
I hope that this point is getting through
Okay, he's fire but we lit the flame, he's siphoning gas  
No one that I call a friend has ever owned a slave  
So fuck this corny little honky, man, the whitey is wack  
Hate the ones who teach they children you ain't shit cause they

&gt;It is not known who wrote the scrolls, although some scholars have credited an ascetic desert sect called the Essenes.

&gt;The sections of the scrolls were pieced together by Dr Eshbal Ratson and Prof Jonathan Ben-Dov of Haifa University. They were written in code and some of the fragments were smaller than 1 sq cm (0.155 sq inches).

These are some of the fragments that have been pieced together:

בשבילי, אישית, אני נשבע את כל מערכות היחסים. אם אתה רואה אותי מחפש בחורה או שזה נראה כאילו אני עומד ללכת מפגר מלא לתוך מערכת יחסים אחרת אתה מוזמן לזרוק את הקישור  עליי שוב כדי להזכיר לי כי אני אף פעם לא היכרויות שוב, אני נראה לתפקד הרבה יותר טוב באופן עצמאי.

I wonder what does it mean 

Race realism hasn't panned out, and it wasn't really a practical topic for long term debates anyways, maybe the next topic could be gun control?

It's similar to immigration in terms of it's place in political discourse, there's lots of arguments to be made, and lots of interesting research to do. There's also probably a lot of good debate opponents to challenge about this, and every time a mass shooting happens, the discussion will flare up as usual and the prep work will be done.

There's the baked alaska debate tomorrow, and the thrasher debate TBA, seems like it might be worth the research.Right !? 
Time ? DISCLAIMER: I’m sorry for bringing this up, I’m totally not trying to come for Destiny, and I really hope this doesn’t make him beat himself up more over things. I completely understand his actions and might have done the same, and I also know that a huge difference between him and JF is that he’s totally admitted the error of his ways, whereas JF didn’t admit shit. Just bringing something up that might be useful to acknowledge for the future.

What destiny “did” to his friend who committed suicide? (i.e. did not discourage them strongly enough)

It seems as though both Destiny and JF could have thought they were doing the right thing at the time, so if that’s the case we have to look at which outcome was worse. Is what happened to Destiny’s friend worse than what happened to JF’s ex/rape victim?

If they’re about the same, then we should be criticizing JF so viciously for being a rapist as if that’s the thing that sets him apart from Destiny, when really it’s the fact that Destiny has admitted fault?I'm still doing stupid things like https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/7qts02/comparison_of_user_interaction_in_dgg_vs_twitch/

This time I wanted to look at how user interaction changes as a response to streamer and rate of chat. I looked at 4 different chats over a period from Feb 2nd 2018 through Feb 7th 2018. Each hour I checked the variables and graphed it. There is no easy way to check if the streamer was live or not from the logs alone, so I didn't look into that. 

There's nothing really surprising from destiny.gg. Basically as rate increases social decreases. It's interesting to look at twitch chats, because they don't really tag other users. It's really just people yelling and hoping the streamer hears. 

Variables Explained:

 * soc: % of messages directed towards a specific user
 * rate: messages per minute
 * n_user: number of unique users tagged
 * time: time in UTC

 * Soc vs Rate all 4: https://i.imgur.com/roNr0Kv.pngMinor digression: In my year-and-a-half of debating with the Alt-right, I’ve noticed they will often use sources that will contain information that will detract from whatever point they’re trying to make. They will omit detracting info. Imo, a greater effort should be made towards obtaining and quickly scanning their sources during the debates.

Fuentes cited a Roper Center poll concerning the American public’s preferred national origins of arriving immigrants. Fuentes placed special emphasis on the “fact” that Americans preferred Scandinavians while not preferring Mexicans and Asians. Destiny’s counter was that national origin wasn’t high on the totem for how Americans graded potential immigrants. He should have asked Fuentes to provide his source. 

&gt;Questions about concerns regarding the ethnic makeup of immigrants to the United States were asked from the very earliest days of polling. When asked in 1939 by Roper/Fortune which nationality of people in the US originally born in a foreign country made the “worst” citizens, a majority (55%) to their credit said they didn’t know. **A plurality of those who gave an answer said Italians (22%), with Jews (6%) and Germans (4%) far behind**. In 1944, most Americans were willing to welcome some immigrants from England, Sweden and Russians, but lower proportions wanted to see Mexicans and Jews allowed to come to the U.S., and **a majority did not want Germans allowed to come**. Just a year later, more than half of those willing to see any immigration from Europe **(88%) said they would not want to see people come to this country from Germany or Russia**, while strong majorities expressed a willingness to welcome immigrants from Scandinavian countries or Holland. These preferences stood much in line with the pro-Northern European structure of the National Origins quota system, with the addition of anti-German feeling from the War.

https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/huddled-masses-public-opinion-and-the-1965-u-s-immigration-act/

At the beginning of the debate, Destiny engaged in a hilarious bait-and-switch where he quoted someone disparaging Italian immigrants, replaced ‘Italian’ with ‘Mexican,’ and asked Fuentes if he agreed or disagreed. Fuentes predictably fell for the trap, earning Destiny points in theatricality. 

This strategy of pointing out the historical frictions of the assimilation of white ethnic groups (their higher rates of crime, their forming of enclaves, and the American public’s opposition to their being here in the first place) is a good one. Particularly if contrasted with the relatively more [seamless integration](https://archive.is/ZgeAg) of specific non-white ethnic groups. It would demonstrate an inconsistency in their assimilation arguments due to their holding of different groups to different standards.

 https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson/status/965848084008726528 , the fact that Ian compares the U.S to fucking Congo and what not and feels justified with mass shooting after mass shooting is pretty disgusting.I really think this is a specific topic on the issue of gun control that Destiny could try to debate and elaborate on. I figured I would bring up a few points that might be good to for Destiny and anyone else to consider in the case that pro-gun advocates suggest the idea of arming teachers.

7 Reasons arming teachers with guns is NOT THE SOLUTION:

1\. We can't afford to pay teachers the wages they deserve and force them to pay out of pocket for school supplies, but we can afford to arm them all with glocks? Not only do the guns cost money, but also the training and compensations for the teachers taking the time to go through training, and the ammunition required.

2\. What safety regulations are we imposing on the teachers who do carry a firearm? Where is the gun kept to ensure the safety of students and staff? Are teachers allowed to open fire first, or do they wait until the shooter has opened fire?

3\. Having a gun in the classroom is a huge safety risk for at least 2 reasons:

a) The threat of a student getting access to the teacher's gun
b) The threat of teachers possibly abusing and acting irresponsibly with their firearm, including using it against the students.

4\. How do we expect students and parents, and even other teachers to feel comfortable in an environment where those in positions of authority are actively armed with firearms?

5\. Teachers are not properly trained to deal with live shooter situations, no matter how much firearm proficiency training they receive. It opens up way too many possibilities of the armed teacher accidentally shooting the wrong target, either by not properly identifying the active shooter, miss-fire, and crossfire. What if a teacher is the one doing the shooting, since, you know, they have a gun at their side at all times? How can other teachers know if the first teacher is firing in self-defense or in an act of aggression?

6\. It adds the unnecessary burden of responsibility to engage the shooter and put their lives on the line.

7\. It puts law enforcement in further danger and makes their job that much harder. When law enforcement make their way through the school, armed, what is there preventing teachers from accidentally shooting law enforcement? And when there are multiple armed people on campus, including teachers, it makes it that much harder for law enforcement to properly and quickly assess the situation and identify the active shooter.

What do you guys think? 

edits: formatting I see people posting the destiny swearing off women meme and I am curious what's that about?destiny keeps talking about this and he doesnt tell us when it is ffs[Homicide accounts for 13% of teen deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db37.htm), and we don't know how much of that 13% includes guns. Does it make sense to give up liberties to have a marginal impact on the broader issue of child-death?

Why do you care if your child dies in school but not other places? 
If you can't control what happens in school, you can't control what happens on the road, or how your teen drives, yet 35% of teen deaths happen from auto accidents. Shouldn't we spend our energy there before addressing school shootings?

Steven talks about acceptable risk... Why do you accept the 35% driving risk, yet the minuscule fraction of deaths from school shooting are unacceptable to the point of giving away civil liberties? In this way you can be framed as politicizing a tragedy to gain political ground.
/u/ExskillsmehIt's a wizard. With the "Lore Mastery" arcane tradition. "Lore Mastery" is not in the PHB but can be found here in the Unearthed arcana test material on page 148 http://www.minisgallery.com/uac.pdf  Destiny mentioned that he was invited back, so I am assuming Koibu would be the DM again and he was using some of the test materials from this document (i.e the artificer played by Noxius). If Koibu is not the DM, then Destiny just has ask for approval to use this arcane tradition.

Lore Mastery : Arcane Tradition

Lore Mastery is an arcane tradition fixated on understanding the underlying mechanics of magic. 
It is the most academic of all arcane traditions. The promise of uncovering new knowledge or proving (or discrediting) 
a theory of magic is usually required to rouse its practitioners from their laboratories, academies, and archives to 
pursue a life of adventure. Known as savants, followers of this tradition are a bookish lot who see beauty and mystery 
in the application of magic. The results of a spell are less interesting to them than the process that creates it. 
Some savants take a haughty attitude toward those who follow a tradition focused on a single school of magic, seeing 
them as provincial and lacking the sophistication needed to master true magic. Other savants are generous teachers,
countering ignorance and deception with deep knowledge and good	humor.

Lore Master:
Starting at 2nd level, you become a compendium of knowledge on a vast array of topics. Your proficiency bonus 
is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion skill if you are proficient 
in that skill. In addition, your analytical abilities are so well-honed that your initiative in combat can be driven by 
mental agility, rather than physical agility. When you roll initiative, it is either an Intelligence check or a Dexterity 
check for you (your choice). 

Spell Secrets: 
At 2nd level, you master the first in a series of arcane secrets uncovered by your extensive studies. When you cast a 
spell with a spell slot and the spell deals acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, radiant, or thunder damage, 
you can substitute that damage type with one other type from that list (you can change only one damage type per casting 
of a spell). You replace one energy type for another by altering the spell’s formula as you cast it. When you cast a 
spell with a spell slot and the spell requires a saving throw, you can change the saving throw from one ability score 
to another of your choice. Once you change a saving throw in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a short 
or long rest.

I like this tradition because it basically allows Destiny to be who he already is, that is saying he knows everything. With double proficiency on all nature, arcana, history, and religion checks it should be no problem in accomplishing that goal. All he needs is a decent charisma stat and he should be able to talk as much as he wants without being inhibited by his character stats/ background (Wander). 

The "Spell Secrets" portion of the arcane tradition is really nice as well. The wizard class is renowned for its versatility and the ability to change the damage type of certain spells to any other means choosing spells just becomes choosing the ones with the highest damage or best debuffs. The second portion of the "Spell secrets" is insane too.  One well timed "charm person" or "hold person" can shift odds into your favor both in or out of combat and the changing of the "ability saves" greatly increases the odds of success. This is all assuming that the first turn is spent using double proficiency to spot weaknesses or have memorized the entirety of the monster manual. 

All in all, my goal was just to find a class/subclass that Destiny would enjoy playing and I have never read a class description that describes destiny so well. Note, this is all simply my opinion and you all can post your recommendations as well.

Destiny really likes to brag that he's been to so many places, but yet he seems to not really understand food, at all. If destiny can be so wrong about this topic, what else can he be horribly wrong about?

Time to watch andy warski's bloodsports. For me, personally, I'm swearing off all debates. If you see me questing Exskillsme or it looks like I'm about to go full retard into another debate feel free to throw this reddit link at me again to remind me that I am never debating again, I seem to function much better independently.I love your video content but damn, I wasn't a big fan of your Twitter activity and frankly, oftentimes I could hardly believe @OmniDestiny was the same guy as the streamer.After the discussion yesterday I felt the need to order some Indian food, however I noticed I had leftover rice.  I need help on what I should do now that the curry is gone.   Can someone please help?

Proof:
https://imgur.com/lno9PoF So I have seen destiny complaining about how much rice these Indian places serve and just had something to say. In India, there are several different regions and each region has specific cuisine. In the northern part of India, they serve more rotis (made out of wheat) and in the southern part they eat rice with everything. Im guessing the only restaurants that Destiny has gone to are southern Indian since their cuisine is more rice based. Also Rice is a big part of the Indian cuisine because it's cheap carbs and in a nation which has a very high poverty rate.

Bonus meme: Here is a comparison of [poverty by region](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/2012_Poverty_distribution_map_in_India_by_its_states_and_union_territories.svg/800px-2012_Poverty_distribution_map_in_India_by_its_states_and_union_territories.svg.png) vs. [amount of rice consumed by region](https://i.imgur.com/N68mlEl.png)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXATSgZuMS4&amp;I understand he gets mad at people repeating things to him that he's read before and already decided to ignore, but as a viewer it's very hard to know if he knows about a stream issue or not.

I typed to him several times about the lack of scrolling on his left-side-of-screen chat box, which is incredibly interesting in the youtube video which typically follows debates. If you watch the video, you're watching the chat in that little box- not the game idling in the background.

Well he got mad and typed !nuke, which in turn muted 12 people who had used a common chat word.. in chat.. and then about 25 people who said SUPA DANKMEMES CHAT as BakedAlaska was talking about YouTube commenters. 

Basically it kills my personal experience. Watching the discussion live with chat running by on even a 2 minute mute can be annoying to those of us who chat a lot, it's restrictive and we lose the opportunity to make memes that will only be relevant for a space of seconds. If the mute is our fault, that's one thing. But what the fuck is up with !nuke muting tons of the most active community members for saying harmless and topical memes?

I guess what I'm trying to say is that for me, personally, I'm swearing off all mutes. If you see me questing an emote spam or it looks like I'm about to go full retard into meme that's too close to the sun, feel free to throw this reddit link at me again to remind me that I am never muting again, I seem to function much better while memeing. How can people be like this?What?

You'd have to buy a Kevlar Vest just to avoid being shot. That costs $300 at least on AliExpress.

You can prevent a stabbing by learning a disarming technique at a BJJ gym with a free trial class.

Is this guy a fucking moron? Who the fuck would prefer being shot than being stabbed? 
Destiny can't get a word in, this guy is going on minute-and-a-half rants then interrupting Destiny when he begins to respond.These youtube debates are always the same thing. They always bring other people to pile on to Destiny because they can't hack it on their own. They read awkward supachat's that are just personal attacks against Destiny. They constantly pivot because they are piss poor at debating. Destiny spends a ton of time trying to real them back on track.

The discussion with him and Chris Baker the other day was much more productive than this mess.
He might not be the best moderator but honestly he's a lot better than I expected, he cut off James Allsup when Destiny wanted to respond and he seemed to genuinelly be asking for permission to bring in other people.
It would have been better if he had not just accepted every source and maybe moderated a bit more but on the whole he wasn't awful.Hi, I'm an actual Honduran. We are FULL of Guns up on this bitch. Literally every honduran over 40 I know owns a gun, This is literally all you need:

An ID Card.

A copy of Criminal and Police Record (usually valid for 6 months)

And a public service receipt, electric, telephone, water, etc. 

Unless you are a corporation, in that case it's much easier. 

You just have to prove that you are a legally established company, have a manager sign and seal an authorization of the gun buy, and that's about it, you can give your employees guns regardless of their background.

I don't live in Honduras anymore (because holy shit there are so many guns there, you guys) but I don't live in the US either, are these requirements REALLY making it impossible to get a gun from an american POV?

As an aside: The reason why our murder rate is damn high is not because of the damn brown people, it was always bad since the 80's because of the ever escalating drug war + the after-effects of the Iran/Contra affair, but more recently is because of the huge poverty rate hike brought by unregulated capitalism and corruption thanks to the De-Facto Government policies after the 09 coup.

Someone on twitter just said he was. I'm pretty sure he isn't but I'm just checking.Every single teacher has to be black male with warrior gene and recent military experience.https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1493/39/1493392868641.jpg I'm talking about this image. I've seen Destiny destroy this a few times but I forget his full argument.

Can anyone help?Wow, listened to the recent debate about guns.

The portion where the other fellow talked about (i.e. lied/used extreme hyperbole, such as pulling over and punching his car until the airbag went off, and describing the comically passe and generic suicidal bathroom scene where he sweeps his meds away in a frenzy and declares no more!) to say the psych meds were the things making him crazy made me physically nauseous.

Not only did he insinuate that he was put on these meds for no reason (the military and VA is just putting people on these for literally no reason? That's what he said) but he also advocated for people to stop taking their meds. This 100% bullshit story and nonsensical anecdote was driven past and all but supported by the host.

Im a healthcare worker (critical care RN) and have some background in psych. This kind of shit is flat out chilling to hear and upset me enough to cry about it here.

I don't know man Destiny, these defensive and emotionally handicapped people are gaining a wider audience when you speak to them and don't draw lines.I don't have kids.

If one day I do, I'll never take them back to America unless it's to visit family.

To see that another school shooting has taken place, and see that one proposed solution is to offer more weapons to an "elite 20% of teachers" at a school, teachers who have combat experience or potentially PTSD makes me fearful for the future of what will be my family.Can't that just be expanded to just "all laws are useless because criminals will not follow them"? It's a shit argument because at that point you might as well advocate for no laws since "bad" people will break the laws anyway and "good" people are just being held back.In the leadup to the Fuentes debate, we were in full Ruroni Kenshin mode, Destiny "took" something from each opponent he faced, and went full shonen. It really paid off in the Fuentes debate.

Unfortunately, the Andy saga didn't pan out. No one was capable of having any sort of discussion, and it devolved into "internet bloodsports". Last nights discussion was a return to form for the debate style, but Destiny was not at his peak. Here's some steps to get back on track for the next debate, and some ideas for how to keep things going.

* Prepare an outline. It's probably worth making one for gun control. Your stream audience loves watching you prep, and it really fucking works.

* Talk to Baked Alaska about moderation. He did an acceptable job, and let you respond to some points when people galloped you.  Privately discuss with him the idea of "going point by point", and get him on your side to do that. He will probably be down. At the very least, insist on him enforcing point by point in dogpiles

* Don't be afraid of dogpiles, and don't turn them down. You excel in those formats. Specifically using humor. When there's three people trying to make you look bad, and you use humor to show the absurdity of what they are saying, it looks really fucking good, and it's one of the best ways to win over those undecideds.

* if you do get gish galloped, maybe try asking them to pick the strongest argument in the list (and rattle off the list), then talk about that point. Even when they pivot back, you can throw the "I thought x point was the strongest?"

* Lastly, don't let yourself get rusty again. Maybe proactively look for another debate to get back on form. You've gotten so good at this, it'd be a shame to stop now.

EDIT: One last thing, consider doing some of the prep for the Thrasher radio debate tonight. That 20% you persuaded might be tuning in, and if you're doing something related, they might stick around.They are the same thing, what holy church has been for Europe through the middle ages till the 17-18th century.
Cars are deeply regulated, form the backbone of the american way of life, and are designed to prevent injury even when misused.  Guns make things not be things anymore because it's fun.  If you see someone that says "we should ban cars", tell them to kill themselves.  In the meantime, for me, personally, I'm swearing off all gun arguments. If you see me questing a nazi/fascist/republican or it looks like I'm about to go full retard into another argument feel free to throw this reddit link at me again to remind me that I am never arguing again, I seem to function much better in my echo chamber.SWEATSTINY

It would be interesting to see someone like exskillsmeh or irishladdie, combining the amount of sources and stats available to counter the alt right.

Bonus meme: league is cancer  
Bonus meme 2: give me contributor [](/PEPE) Okay, so now this has come to light:

https://twitter.com/cbsnews/status/966801533642989569

Of course there are a lot of angles to take on this:

-An armed police officer didn’t stop the killer, so would some random instructors have done it if they had firearms? (Lol)

The weird thing to me though is that both sides seem to be digging into him for this. Would any of you guys have actually walked towards that AR fire with your Glock and tried to contest the shooter?

This is a legitimate question. This officer resigned and will probably be chastised for the rest of his life, but was one officer really supposed to stop this by himself with a Glock and like 2 magazines? I truly don’t think most people would go towards the gunfire in this situation. People are saying he’s a coward, how he should lose his pension, and whatever else — but there’s no way it’s that easy to just overcome self preservation and walk towards a situation with the odds stacked against you like that. I know I couldn’t have. The police send in dozens of SWAT members usually in a situation like this, but this one school officer was supposed to do it all himself?

Curious to hear your thoughts.Jesus fucking christ every time I hear this argument I feel like smashing a flaming brick into that person's face for being fucking retarded as shit. 

If drugs weren't illegal, there would be a whole lot MORE people who would be using drugs then there are today, as just there are a lot of people owning guns today. Banning guns would mean a whole lot LESS people will have access to guns, thus a whole lot LESS gun violence. I often find it interesting (as a non american) that the accessibility of guns and their constant use are so dissociated. I haven't looked into the issue a massive amount, but suicides certainly are often 'crimes' of convenience, a new york times tidbit on the issue: http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/06/magazine/06suicide-t.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=2  

I really wonder if this explains a chunk of the current killing zeitgeist. Perhaps access to tools influences directly the way in which we choose to perform tasks (of which, killing, could disgustingly be considered).

I'm not sure if there's more research on this or if it would be useful in an upcoming meme fest (in particular the radio one). But I did think it was something I've never personally seen Destiny dive into. 
I think it would help if Destiny avoided ending his sentences like he sometimes does on an unsure note, with words/sounds like “er, or, like,” or a laugh instead of finishing his sentence. It kind of triggers me and I think his arguments would have more impact if he ended most of his sentences on a firm note. Another thing in the same vein is that Destiny sometimes ends his last word with a jerky, quick breath, as if he was going to start another sentence but changed his mind. Destiny can at least stop the habit of sudden clipped breathing at the end of a spiel — I feel like that’s a pretty clear and unquestionable thing that will improve his delivery if he stops doing it.Once they realize blacks can be teachers they'll find a way to justify stopping it [](/PEPE)This former soldier is the definition of people who should not have a weapon.


He literally says he wanted to eat his gun. Is it just me or does it seem like the alt right just keep changing their position on europe to fit their narrative? In all the immigrants debate they keep saying Europe is flooding with immigrants and the next gun debate there are no violence because they are all white countries? 

As a danish citizen i think it's pretty clear that guns always will escalate a situation. If a person want to rob another person here, and they are armed, it almost never escalate to death. The gun in this situation is ment to "scare" not kill. If both parties have weapons, now the robber need to go way further to get what he wants, and that is why people end up dead. 

Saw this on twitter and can't agree more:
"You've been brought up all your life loving these objects of destruction. It's like a cult. Only a person outside the cult can see how insane it is"And does anyone have a timestampSo this started going around last night and its been brewing this morning on right/conservative/alternative media and I think will be the next pivot in this discussion from that side.

And to be honest, its a great choice. To suggest that collusion between school boards, police departments and local governments could be covering up crimes in order to scrub school crime stats is a way better idea than to suggest its all holograms and crisis actors. 

Improving overall crime stats from youths in schools leads to large grants/kickbacks from the feds and its shared around generously. It also ties in to the Progressive movement to end the so-called "School-to-Prison-Pipelines" that is claimed to disproportionately result in People of Color failing to graduate high school.

Essentially the narrative will be "Broward County covered up so many crimes that they actively did not pursue leads into Nikolas Cruz, therefore our current Gun Control systems are fine they just are not being enforced properly".

Which like I said is a way better story to weave than Alex Jones tier stuff.

Apologies for the pretty bad sources, but give them a look and like I said keep an eye out today and next few days for this new shift in tone:

So a new KH trailer came out a few weeks ago, and with it a new song. There has been tons of disagreements about it so I'd like to hear destiny's opinion (and those who understand music) on it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc2vEr-618gThis week saw the enlightenment accepted across the world and, of course, in celebration of such an achievement the biggest wars the world has yet to see. Armies of half a million engaged on either side across the borders of France and Germany as the struggle of the second coalition war rages on. Napoleon Bonaparte himself has emerged from the french revolution leading the chaotic spread of the communist ideals.

But as all world wars we must look at the setting that allowed such a [situation](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/283386529211088897/409519958645800960/eu4_map_SER_1650_06_02_1.png). The fractured states of Italy were the spark for our last major battles, but this time our powder keg is only (((money))). The East Baltic Dutch Company has been extracting massive quantities of trade from the baltic sea, to such an extent there is an economic recession throughout Sweden and Russia. [The last small states among the HRE are quickly consolidated into larger nations and there are no more small conquests that will not involve major powers](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/283386529211088897/412050038303490049/eu4_map_RUM_1700_09_06_1.png). Following the betrayal of Italy, Sweden and Russia look to reclaim their lost land. The might of France, Portugal, Netherlands, The Pope, and Serbia is insurmountable for the economically weakened allies. Our diplomats turn to the only option left, Rum; though he has been enabling France for generations our ambassadors feel confident they must understand that if we die the eyes of unified Europe will turn on them so he must come to our aid.

Sweden delivers an ultimatum to the Netherlands, return our Lubeck land or face war. Time goes by without a response and war is declared. France responds by declaring his own war on Russia to come to the trade empires aid, and to our great horror his ally Rum accepts his call to arms. Baffled our lines fall back into defensive formations unsure of what to do. There is no hope of victory against such a massive force, but there was no other option for our beleaguered country to take. As the wave of forces crash along the german border Rum realizes the folly of their choices and accepts white peace, promising to intervene. The united nations is so thrown into chaos from recent events it cannot recognize Rums intervention into a great power war, so after years they are forced to break their truce and declare on France anyway.

By this time the French, Portuguese, Dutch, Papual, and Serbian forces have pushed the line through germany and into russia proper. Rum was supremely confident they would blow through Serbia and be involved in the war immediately, but the sieges take longer than expected. Alone in Scandinavia the Swedish army faces France and Netherlands alone. As we distract the bulk of the coalitions forces we can only trust Russia and Rum are linking up and pushing the invasion back in europe. Our generals take a few tactical battles, but the numbers are astronomical. After losing a battle our army was trapped in the Norwegian coast, but some mountain maneuvers and an small stack of Frenchmen provided an opening to force a retreat behind the arctic circle evading a stack wipe. 

After the majority of our land was sieged we could do no more, we looked down dismayed to find Russia and Rum were still struggling to organise and force Serbia out of the war. Our administration was driven from the war a few months later, ceding some land to France. A unified border between Russia and Rum was finally created and the armies marched out of scandinavia to regroup and push into Russia. Our troops relocated to our german enclave and observed the conflict. The coalition forces reached all the way to mid poland within a year, breaking through Russia's outer fort line. As things looked worse and worse we knew we had to act. Our armies rebuilt, we disregarded our truce and attacked France. The few forts in the corridor between France and Russia quickly fell to our positioned troops. The supply lines of the grand army were entirely cut off (though in EU4 this is meaningless except for retreat options….) , though before the armies of Russia and Rum could tighten the noose they took the forts back and slipped out. Though the trap provided valuable time with which all the wars gains in Russia were reversed. Effectively reset the war began anew on the german french border. Here the stalemate dragged on; million man battles raged back and forth, reinforcements targeted to extend the battle with across provinces. Though each time they made gains the coalition was pushed back.

During all this the Dutch administration became preoccupied and left their government to others, they sent armies wildly around Russia and Siberia unchecked. Their new king, A.I.,was a troublesome nuisance and the front was shifted to the Dutch homeland. After several attempts a siege was successful and a peace brokered. Now down to a single war the front shortened, but the original reasons for said war no longer remained. After much deliberation a peace was constructed. The three wars with France were ended simultaneously, they received a payment of gold, Sweden got our land back, and France agreed they would no longer defend Netherlands so we could take our trade back. 

Following the resolution a revolution broke out in France and they became a Revolutionary Empire lead by none other than Napoleon Bonaparte. Rum was supremely confident serbia would be rolled over instantly in an offensive and so war was declared on Serbia and Netherlands alone. The recovering Swedish army expected a quick war and support from Russia and Rum, but received none. Our armies battled the Dutch 1 v 1, while both nations took longer than expected to handle Serbia. Nevertheless we did our duty and overran the Dutch coast, though once we were done full occupying the nation it turned out the serbs had broken into the heartland of Russia and were on a siege rampage. The war that was supposed to be over by christmas dragged on many years. So many years in fact that our short truces with France expired. France rallied the second coalition, despite a tenuous understanding of letting us take our trade back, and war returned to Europe.

So began the 30 years so far of the second coalition war. Peace was immediately brokered with Serbia and Netherlands and our armies fell back to regroup in Russia. It took many months for our armies to come together and our military planners to prepare for the conflict. During this vital early time of the war much land on the german border was ceded. Once organized our armies engaged along the polish border. Massive battles ensued, all six nations committed the vast quantities of manpower at their disposal and casualties of fights started to far exceed 100k values for 600k armies. Seeing the advance stall out after a loss the coalition forces fell back to the Alps along the french and palpal border to regroup. Occupied land was eventually liberated and it seemed neither side could venture into the others for more than a few months before being repelled. It was in this stalemate a brilliant Swedish officer concocted a master plan.

General Douglas MacGnomed entered the alliance war room bringing operation Venetian Mongoose. Our friendly Greek trade ships periodically brought us intelligence from the Adriatic Sea, a regiment of Papal units was defensively encamped just north of Venice. The coalition line extended north all the way along the french border and reinforced as fights broke out, but this position believed itself safe from the initial battle and had no officer staff present. We quickly negotiated military movement through Serbia and fell upon the defenders from the darkness before they could react. In a total route the regiment was destroyed before reinforcements could arrive, thus when they did reach the province we had already established defensive formations optimizing our military position. In a stunning move an aggressive assault acquired the defensive fortifications and repealed the counter attack. Inflicting massive casualties to the coalition army Operation Venetian Mongoose preformed a lighting pivot and raced to the french border. Before the coalition army could regroup, much less reinforce, critical border forts were sized and a foothold in France established. 

Though this foothold would exchange hands several times in the coming years key fortifications remain in allied hands. The push to reach Paris remains as the war rages on in northern France. Already millions have died on either side, but as long as the flow of money endures, the greed of imperialism will never be satisfied. How long can the people of Europe survive such an endeavor, only time will tell, but the war that has raged continuously for 30 years, and off and on for 50, shows no signs of ending soon.

Game on 03/03 3pm CST.**
I’ve always really enjoyed watching john oliver and colbert but recently I’ve been catching myself cringing at some of the obvious liberal pandering. I mean, I know there’s a big market right now for anti-trump/anti-right content, but sometimes I feel like the late-night scene is a bit oversaturated. do you guys think that these shows are just starting to become leftist circle jerks? I just started watching his channel the other day, his 20min Dave Rubin rant made me an instant subscriber. Been watching a lot of his previous debates, really enjoying it. His messaging is great and can't help but laugh when he makes the alt right melt like snowflakes.

I'd really like to see a Mike Cernovich video and specifically bringing up this blog post by Mike :

https://web.archive.org/web/20160318163008/http:/www.dangerandplay.com/2012/02/27/when-masturbation-leads-to-a-close/


No idea how to get it to him or maybe it's already been covered? Either way it's a good link to have in your back pocket if the topic of Cernovich ever comes upI don't live in the US, and no one I know cares at all about having a gun and think this whole issue is absolutely absurd. Just wondering if anyone else outside the US knows someone who justifies the utter lack of gun control in the states.So you're looking to venture forth into the world of the second greatest table top role-playing game DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS! Well good for you, it's a game with endless possibility were the only limit is your imagination,

well lucky for you, unlike the question of your sexuality the answer is simple. MOTHER FUCKING STONE SORCERER!!!!

IT'S YOUR ONE STOP SHOP FOR MAGIC AND BIG DICK SWORD SWINGING
"we'll what does it actually do" IT DOES FUCKING EVERYTHING FROM THROWING MAGIC MISSLES TO LITERALLY SETTING YOUR SWORD ON FIRE WITH MYSTIC GREEN FLAMES! YOU'RE LITERALLY A MAGIC SWORD DUDE

"I don't know, i'm scared of being squishy and going down easily" WELL NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT BUTTERCUP! THE ONLY WAY THE STONE SORCERER GOES DOWN IS IF ITS FOR DEVOURING THAT SWEET PUSS. WITH A ROCK HARD AC OF 18
THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IS DROWNING IN THE TEARS OF THOSE MAGIC-LESS FUCBOI FIGHTERS WHO'RE CRYING ABOUT YOUR DAMAGE AND HP GROWTH.

[The only debate Destiny lost to..... his son.](https://clips.twitch.tv/BitterWimpyShallotDoggo)


We need a stream day or something. It's quality content.
I just finished the FF VII Playthrough and I crave more.

Please help a sick guy pass his time.Normies in chat, many of you may know the NCAA college tournament coming up and it might be fun to do a bracket pool with your friends from chat. 

I just wanted to get a feel if you guys would be interested in playing? I'm going to assume we're not putting any money into this, so it's just for bragging rights. Wintrading, coaching, queue sniping, int throwing, it needs to be done. The higher the rank he gets, the more time he spends in queue and the more we get him shooting the shit with chat on YouTube and Reddit.  Koibuo continues to do at great job keeping up the immersion and moving the action along. I think everyone on the team is good at role playing without being annoying/grating or slowing down progress. This was a 11/10 session, I can't see what antics Thiefstiny gets up to next week.What exactly is happening, and what is our timeline? I can't seem to find anybody that's sure. 

When is AngelThump dying, and do we have a replacement for it?

When is OverRustle dying, and do we have a replacement for it? 

I am under the impression that OverRustleLogs will never go away, is that accurate? 

Who is managing whatever new or updated systems are emerging? I think ILiedAboutCake is walking away from something soon? 

Pls help, -Concerned ChatterThe level of creativity that man would have come up with if the court documents involved Destiny's personal life had been revealed omfg hahahaa how are these people real it's incredible. THERE WOULD BE A SYNCHRONY OF VIDEOS from Warski and Tonka and bunch all making  their trilogy videos and onwards and then the wannabes would also make their videos. **A through K of the adjective animal youtubers would  put bread on the table  for a full year with all of the videos they would make.**


It would have been Kraut and Tea except there would have been fucking ten parts  and it would have been biblical and it would have been funny.

He's alt-right so we hear him swallow  all explanations and of course 
 he does not eve make any serious jokes at   the expense of a man who literally tried to impregnate a mentally 10 year old woman after meeting her for three weeks. A man who literally doesn't give a fuck and gives more evidence and even confirms shit in the court documents by talking about how "When I meet a woman I want to impregnate them!" and his absurdly predatory language "I did not consent to her being taken from me" and he now refers to the whole incident in this video as "**FALSE ALLEGATIONS FROM HIS EX [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NakwewJmBhw)**"  and Metokurs response in discussions to date have been "uh-huh" and make every possible rationalisation like : she can drive an automatic car!!!!!!!! (Something  many  practical toddlers do on farms once  its utility is great enough)

These men literally have a huge ripe milk cow and they are starving and emaciated, host a stacked 7v1 and harvest one drop to slurp and then act satisfied while the real milk  source Gariepy oozes  with over-containment, "NO.... This one is sacred" they say raise their pitch forks and refuse you to milk him, for fuck sake  just look at Gariepy's bullfrog neck pulsating with each breath.


I can't take this shit seriously any longer it was like watching that video of people angrily throwing shit off an AID truck after looking at the serial date.

Sorry for the atrocious composition and cap and hyperbole just go in and am a bit smashed IF you don't know him, Russell Brand is very very left wing so this was an interesting talk.

A few big figures in the skeptic community that are generally loved for their "anti-sjw" politics include Milo, Jordan Peterson, and Ben Shapiro. Another popular YouTube channel among these people is PragerU.

All of these are heavily Christian. When did some of the most popular skeptic figures become Christian? What gives?Personally I think the demand for a good "libcuck" is there but the market is shit right now. Aside from Kulinski, Pakman, and Seder who else is really killing it as a liberal? Not many. This is where my boi Destiny comes in.

&amp;nbsp;

You can rattle off a ton of names on the alt right side and they all got a ton of fervant listeners and fans. 


&amp;nbsp;

My proposal is this: Destiny debates 1-2 retards a week. Why? Because he needs to. He needs to put more content out there, he needs more debates. He needs to keep his blade sharp. Right now I believe Destiny is kind of stuck in between being a league streamer, a gamer, and a political memer. I personally believe his talents are wasted on shit like league of legends. I don't think he should stray away from gaming content but I definitely think there should be more political content on his channel. I think he should discuss stuff like the recent Nunes memo, the recent FBI indictments on key people in the cabinet, the russian interference in the election, any topic that is even remotely political, I think destiny should make a video about it and discuss it.

&amp;nbsp;

I would personally love to see a time where Destiny is a full politics memer debating the likes of Shapiro, Coulter, Milo, Rubin, Jordan Peterson, anyone and everyone on anything they disagree about. It would be very interesting. Something like an 80% politics/social commentary vs 20% gaming split. 

&amp;nbsp;

Whaddaya guys think?&gt; I sit watching destiny senpai play league.  Before long he gets in a team fight and it looks like a clean ace of their team is imminent.  My hand wanders down to my dick ready to stroke.   Destiny begins his mating call "YEEEEEE -"  I stroke furiously, rapidly approaching climax.  The YEE continued on and on.  Sweat began to drop down my forehead.  How long could one man Yee?  Then I remembered he once played the saxophone.  His yee could go on for as long as 2 minutes.  And I never lasted that long; 40 seconds was my limit.   I prayed for the sweet boi to come but the boi never came.  And neither did I.  All that remained were blue balls and grey screen.  [Listen here](https://pinecast.com/listen/3da3c40a-8d9c-442a-bf50-567bd27e0600.mp3)

I got the opportunity to interview Destiny and chat a little bit, and I wanted to release it to you guys about a week before it'll it the feed.

If you enjoyed it, don't hesitate to listen to other episodes [here](http://thepodcastingcouch.x10host.com/) and consider subscribing!

-Be Decent-

Edit: You guys are one hell of an engaged community. 13 hours live and this is already my most played episode to date. Thanks for the bump, and I hope some of you stick around for future episodes!They're just women with cameras moaning about SJWs with no context or intellectual depth, and when I see these videos I can imagine fat chud neckbeard with a MAGA hat jerking so hard that a huge load of cum started covering a monitor screen with Roaming Millenial's face paused on it.

Plus, watching their content reminds of that one part of [RLM's Rogue One review where Vader with the lightsaber is basically Star Wars fanservice at this point](https://youtu.be/Kc2kFk5M9x4?t=33m48s). Watching these thots with trashy makeup (seriously, Roaming Millenial always looks like she's dressed for a porn shoot) spouting the most vapid garbage with no intellectual value is basically equivalent that.

But I digress. It's unfair to compare Anti-SJW female youtubers to porn stars because even porn stars have more brains than Roaming Millenial and Brittany Venti. I'd rather listen to political opinions from Kacey Kox than from Lauren Southern IMO.So here's this weeks spreadsheet, just a couple things before you ask.

1. % of total time is &gt;100% because of overlap of multiple things (discussions while playing games for example)
2. If you want to sort the columns, click file&gt;download as and download the spreadsheet
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QrJW1ScbSeq1atnWRWBt4FuPlGuxnQXMLA3kyaTKav8/

Also, Hillshire has put together an awesome site related to the spreadsheet here https://infinite-cliffs-94665.herokuapp.com/ 

You can sort by category/topic, navigate the vod by parts, filter out parts of the stream you don't want to see, and there are links to timestamps for everything. The site searches for my post every 3 hours so this weeks spreadsheet should be on there within 3 hours from this post.

Also, here's the link to next weeks spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14XRJvT7iaTguL9w1wg7F6rex8NSJpq2TfMzo_yd75q4/

I'll be updating that throughout the week, no promises or anything as far as keeping it up to date daily but if you want to bookmark that and check back from time to time, there ya go.So I recently read that Lily and Albert are dating, which was news to me cause I thought all the offline tv stuff was just memes. So I googled it and came across prettyuglylittleliar.net and lolcow (or /snow/ idfk). And it's literally just a bunch of people hating on female online personalities, some posts are pretty heinous shit. So I was wondering if this what you guys are talking about when mentioning incels?It's a beautiful game

Destiny spoke out against grindy games but that's all he does playing stuff like Factorio and Terraria

A lot of room to innovate and have fun with builds

It's a great background game for debates and discussions, you can play it on brain off mode while talking to someone

There's always new content being pushed, new leagues so you won't get bored of it

No sniping

Nice community and great for streaming

There might be a bunch of other Dggers who play it and might help you



She is too far gone. She was laughing at some transgender wrestling story on fox news so I went in to see what was going on. Anyway, the moment I brought how much bs the things Tucker and some random Aussie dude were saying and why- she started losing it saying the college is liberal, etc. and all the news stories and everything on google (that I was pulling up) is liberal. I tried to explain how crazy it sounds that everyone else always wrong but fox news.  
&amp;nbsp;  
How can I possibly expect to care about this individual when anything that doesn't confirm her bias she says is some liberal conspiracy? I can't just avoid anything political because she loves talking about things that she is just wrong about. I can't stand people that are so dishonest, it drives me mad. Should I just stop contact with her? How does Destiny do it?  
&amp;nbsp;  
EDIT: BTW I don't really have much family. It's the best emote. Also fuck poggers kill that shitty emoteDaFeels. It was a good run boys...Pretty fun memes so far, lotta depth to a simple premise.

http://store.steampowered.com/app/590380/Into_the_Breach/MarketplaceOfIdeasMan is so fucking insufferable. She/he makes the general-mydude channel a cess pool. Literally an aspie who can't communicate without gnoming and gnelf bashing. If there is a God, MarketplaceOfIdeasman is 12 yo. Otherwise there is no hope.Last I remember he was arguing with that one skeptic asian chick. I wasn't sure what to title this, but I had an interaction yesterday that I found really interesting.

I have a history class in college that focuses on war. In particular, we've talked about the Civil War for the past few weeks, and really honed in on the legacy aspect for the past week or so. Yesterday, we were supposed to come in with an opinion about the Confederate Flag, something that the professor has supposedly done for 11 semesters and had no problem with. Yesterday was a bit of a different story - first, a girl cried, then this happened.

There's this kid who sits right at the front. Fairly certain he's a history major and very invested into it as well. He's driven me crazy with some of his points before - once he told the professor that [Abraham Lincoln wanted to send all the slaves to Guatemala after his presidency](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/26/blog-posting/did-abraham-lincoln-plan-send-ex-slaves-central-am/) and the professor didn't challenge him on it.

This kid always has an opinion on everything. So when the confederate flag comes up, of course he's there to raise his hand. He did it a couple times, the first time bringing up something about how attacking the confederate flag is an attack on white identity because we don't hold the US flag to the same standards,  then the second time he said that America was founded as a white nation and that only changed in the Civil Rights act.

Now he did end up getting into some frivolous argument with a bunch of ex military guys in the back who were wearing high fades, saying that it's a Nazi haircut or some bullshit like that and I think one of the guys intimidated him by calling him a bastard, but that's kind of besides the point.

The point is, because of Destiny, I recognized all of his talking points. I noticed exactly what he was saying because I had seen it several times before. I think he brought up before that he watches race realist livestreams (plus he said yesterday that he argues with Twitter personalities) and him being so open about that made me think it was probably out of some morbid curiosity more than being a serious race realist, but if that's the case, he's been swayed pretty heavily by them.

Just a thanks to Destiny for debating these people in the open and not letting their bullshit fester. I worry sometimes that if I weren't exposed to a lot of their rhetoric here, where there are people actively working to show the fault in their reasoning, that I would end up as some sort of hateful bigot down the line. Their points are often well articulated so it makes sense how it can sway even intelligent people like this guy seems to be. It's especially fascinating since I've never seen someone like that in real life before, but they definitely exist and they're exactly how they seem like they would be.Title. This is the first time I've seen a video from this guy and I'm not sure what to make of it (I was skeptical XDD). I followed two of his sources, skimmed them and came to the conclusion that there's no underlying lies or misdirection like Stefan Molymeme or African American Pigeon Speaks does. 

Does anyone have a legitimate, in-depth debunking or analysis of one of this guy's videos where they actually know what they're talking about? All he wants to talk about is how Russia is a nothingburger. Does anyone know how Destiny acquired his music library, did he download them with some program, or did he simply buy the albums. I'm asking because i would like to get a good music library going on Foobar, thanks.Guys, I thought you should know, but JP is a bad man. He is very very bad and also mean! &gt;:(

Some of the things he says basically mean that he's Hitler and a baby rapist combined. R-right guys? And anyone who says "no"  probably wants to suck his wee wee (hehe got'em bois)!

Anywho, I just thought I'd play my part in keeping a "JP is a bad man" post on the front page, no need to thank me. Alt-right is stuck in their own bubble btw!

Edit: Damn, we're not on the front page anymore. Can someone make a new JP post please?Was he arrested, I'm hearing rumors that escalates the boogie2988 RIP rumors.So I'm going to Bonnaroo again this summer and a big thing we do is make custom tapestries/flags and was looking for our favorite YEE boi or some other ideas for flags/tapestries that I could have made in the next few months. Thanks.Change my view (protip: you can't).kelled in action before his time [](/DaFeels) 7Does someone have a link to the video that Steven watched here?

The house of Team 3 rose to power in the Great Horde and Lithuania simultaneously, our family deeply embedded into both countries. I oversaw the horde while my brother Skitz managed the Lithuanians. The infighting following the Great Khan's death has left our empire in tatters, but we will see it one day reunified; first we must regain our forefathers inheritance and reclaim the Golden Horde to establish our right to all the Mongolian Empire's land. These dreams are far off, at present we must make due with a rule who is inept in every way. How he even manages to form a coherent though beyond, 'make the horde great again', is beyond us. To survive his lifetime we must seek allies elsewhere. On our boarder is a hungry Hungary and a covetous Poland, to shore up this boarder a secret delegation is sent to the Emperor of the HRE and his Holiness the Papal States to secure a defensive pact. Should Poland and Hungary ever invade us they would take up arms and invade them on their other front. 

Feeling secure the banners of the tribes were called and we raided a Caucasian minor, pillaging their land and humiliating their hopeless leaders. They fled to the mountains, but our cavalry thundered after them and nothing survived. In the west the last bastions of the theocracies were being invaded by Poland, to secure our rich coastal trading nodes Lithuania also declared war and occupied our key provinces, waiting for their other wars to end. The Polish dragged their armies along the coast and years past as we awaited our day to sack their capitol and access the Baltic. Sensing a growing unease we moved our armies into the heartland of Lithuania, though still on leave and low maintenance, but in position should Polish greed be getting the best of them. Low and behold our suspicions were correct, in their capitulation Poland forced the Livonian Order to become their vassal and inherited their wars. The day of lies and treachery had come.

Past generations of Lithuanians had trusted their Polish allies, as such there were no forts or defenses along the entire southern front, the Polish armies raced across the land and to the capitol. Our armies already in position prepared for battle, the many clans gathering from across the steppe. The ousting of power in both Poland and Hungary had come with spectacular rules, men of wit and knowledge well above their peers, in contrast our leaders were mute and dumb. This resulted in a drastic strategic advantage for the westerners. As our horses charged into the besieging ranks in glorious thunder, their men tightened formation, their moral held, and disciplined commanders kept their lines together. Ordinarily an army shattered from the fear of our stampede, trembled with the quaking of the earth, and fled, but these new advanced formations weathered our daunting storm. Then the Polish cavalry held in reserve smashed into our southern flank, our extended cavalry lines collapsed and order was lost on the battlefield. The pride of the steppe, the most fearsome cavalry in the world, retreated in disarray.

It would appear treachery ran deep among this era, we heard word from the far west; Castile and England had made a deal with Burgundy and Denmark to take the land of France and Aragon. Two massive wars sprang up, but instead of being invaded from both sides the French had struck another deal with their enemies, conceding a few provinces to Burgundy they agreed to peace and what looked like an overwhelming force was cut in half. Left alone in their war England and Castile were unable to match the armies of France and Aragon and were pushed back across the channel. France and Aragon grew, much to the observers discomfort throughout Europe. 

Regrouping our armies met up again in eastern Lithuania, repeated the allied forces counter attacked our invaders, but as time went on their understanding of warfare only grew faster and faster than ours. Their military tactics hit heights our commanders had yet conceived and our lacking monarchs only shone through more and more. The only hope was to hold on long enough for Austria and the Pope to have devastated their lands enough to end their ambitions, and even then we were dependent on them not abandoning us in the peace negotiations. A herald was sent to the west to relay the progress our allies had made; Hungary had been overrun and was occupied, but the mountain boarder between their lands was proving difficult to break. Baffled we implored them to use their influence as Emperor to navigate around the difficult mountain boarder and access Poland through the grasslands of Bohemia, and after discovering Bohemia had already happily given permission for such an event demanded they march immediately... who knows how many thousands of lives could have been saved if a years campaign in the Carpathians had been avoided. 

On the home front we rallied army after army to crash into the invading forces and time after time we were turned away. Rebels sprang up across the land and presented a greater problem to our enemies than we were ever able to mount. As time dragged on the Hungarian army all but disappeared, their manpower long used up and their home besieged. Poland began to be occupied and their numbers faltered. Once again the banners went out and the people of the steppe gathered. Once again our horses raced across the grassland to the Lithuanian capitol. But this time, on this time the Polish back was broken, their troops disheartened and withering, unable to sustain a siege while their homes burned. Finally they ignored the mad beckonings of their king who ordered them onward and deserted for their homes. The Polish and Hungarian crowns simultaneously went bankrupt and a turning point in the war was marked. We had weathered the storm of aggression and blind ambition, we had survived the full might of their empires, a might that had exhausted themselves so thoroughly they lost all control of their land. A tale of greed and recklessness that saw their kings ousted by their people, their families driven from power, their lands spiraling in successive bankruptcies, and helplessly watching as surrounding nations and rebels devoured their defenseless land. 

In our winnings from the Polish we too succumbed to our vengeful greed and took from them massive swaths of land. Those in the HRE did not look kindly on our decision and formed a coalition against us. This was an army too strong for our beleaguered forces and our economies could not sustain another true war. Quickly we rode through the land, sacking Berlin and occupying all of Brandanburg, the coalition leader, hoping for an eased deal in the peace negotiations. We returned Krakow to the polish and payed off their concerns, another economic hit to our empires. It would seem our troubles had not ended, or gone unnoticed by our neighbors. The fellow hordes to the north seized upon the chance to claim our land, they too wanted to restore the titles of the Great Khan. A watchful Muscovy also prepared for war and began claiming our rivaled lands. The signs were all too present as the cavalry of the north overran our boarders and spewed forth across the steppe. Our family was ousted and departed to Africa to have a quieter life of trade and profit. 



The campaign overall had some problems so we are restarting this weekend, if you would like to join you can get in anew.[clip 0:40-1-11](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=88KJ5rgCNmk)

He also makes other baseless blanket statements on all academia [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6n3pFFPSlW4)Since Destiny mentioned/watched the Blue eyes Brown eyes experiment on stream, I've been looking into diffrent videos on this experiment being conducted. 

I came across the experiment being done on German television [(ZDF)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8B3xt8XejMc). It's in German.
Towards the beginning of the experiment one white person from the brown eyed group leaves the experiment because she isn't 	comfortable treating the other group in such a discriminatory way. [Clip at 19:54](https://youtu.be/8B3xt8XejMc?t=19m54s)

She explains herself saying she left the experiment because she couldn't endure the feeling that the blue eyed people where being treated so poorly. [Clip at 21:16](https://youtu.be/8B3xt8XejMc?t=21m16s)

So far this is pretty par for the course on how the experiment goes but then the people running the experiment chime in. The moderator asks psychologists the explict question if the decision to leave the experiment is the right or the wrong thing to do. The social psychologist affirms that the decision is the right one and the white woman that leaves the experiment is very brave in doing so. [Clip at 22:09](https://youtu.be/8B3xt8XejMc?t=22m9s)

I was a bit puzzled by this because in my understanding of this experiment/exercise it isn't really about standing up to some sort of authoritarianism. I was under the impression that any resistance to the experiment worsens the learning effect. 

This deflection to authoritarianism is also present in the comments on Reddit regarding the experiment. [1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/3zpcc2/jane_elliot_blue_eyesbrown_eyes_experiment_1970/cyobc5y/)
[2]
(https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/14m7lu/i_dont_know_how_many_people_know_about_jane/c7ejva6/)

Am I misunderstanding something about this whole thing? Is there a right and a wrong way to act in the brown eyed group?
Heya guys, just wanted to give you an update on this thread in case you've missed it:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/8mpw7w/what_loldamar_said_is_not_funny/

To refresh your memory quickly, I made a thread 3 days ago asking people not to downvote dissenting opinions just because they disagree in order to promote healthier less echo-chamber'y discussions.

To sum up 90% of the responses, the answer I got was:

- No, fuck you.

To go in a bit more detail, it was a mix of:

- Loldamar is an evil retard/troll (missing the point that it's not just about loldamar).

- You are an evil retard/troll (because asking not to automatically downvote differing opinions is evil/retarded/trolling).

- wHy Do YoU cArE aBoUt UpVoTeS? (Which was the weirdest, because the group of people who seems to care a lot about minorities cannot fathom how the current system could have a negative impact on those who's opinion is in the minority).

&amp;nbsp;

The reason I thought you might need an update is because, ironically enough, while people here claim that "uPvOtEs DoN't MaTtEr", their very own auto-moderator of this sub actually does care about exactly that. Some users went as far as going through my entire comment history just to downvote me (at least one by their own admission), because they were so petty and upset that someone would dare ask people to follow the rediquette. What a right-leaning nazi fascist white nationalist idea it must be.

It's so baffling how the people here that are delusional enough to claim how "this sub is self-critical enough" and "the echo chamber meme is overblown" can be so ignorant and blind to what they're doing so blatantly. Even the joke replies I made to other jokes got downvoted heavily just because it was ME who posted them, the "evil retarded troll" who thought that maybe we shouldn't just massively downvote people for no good reason. What a retard, huh! So, my comment karma ended up in the negatives because this was a new account I made for anonymity reasons (not for this sub; and sorry to disappoint, I'm not loldamar) and the very thread I made to point out the huge circlejerk on this sub got censored by the circlejerk.

Anywho, that's the update. Take this as you will. Use it as food for thought or stay in denial, it's up to you. I won't be making any replies to the comments in this thread and I'll probably avoid posting here for a while to avoid the risk of my posts getting deleted, since even memes/jokes get downvoted here based on your political affiliation. I personally don't care about my own downvotes so I might come back in the future after I've acquired some comment karma. All I'm really interested in is having fun/memeing and having productive thought-provoking discussions. Unfortunately, I am physically unable to participate in those things in this community as of this moment.Yesterday Destiny did his spiel of explaining his audience that people dont recognize how the little things in the life of minorities of any kind can drastically change the experience someone has compared to for example the average white man. 
he did go into microaggressions, unconscious bias, the meaning of words and jokes etc etc. some of his examples were women in online gaming,
women representation in media in general or the daily plight of having a different skin color. 
i mostly agree with this even though he makes the mistake calling unconscious bias discrimination or racism, for what i've heard researchers in the field wouldn't do.

&amp;nbsp;

But what i dont understand is holding those views and behaving basically almost the opposite on his stream.


(YES these are all jokes, i know if you think i accuse destiny of bigotry you are stupid, if your defense is "he just mocks people".. you too dense, please dont comment)


* the constant use of autism or retard as an insult (and i think this drastically increased over the months)
* when there is racial minority in a video he's watching, you can almost bet he is bringing it up or a racial joke isn't far away
* constantly dog whistling the n-word with "i might say IT... i say IT....Ni.... haha nevermind"
* making sexist jokes with the female he's hanging out with: calling them "thots" and "e girls", doing the small female brain/big male brain thing
* constant ethnostate comments when it comes to hispanic people
* he never misses the opportunity to make anti semitic jokes or holocaust references
* when he's playing with one of his asian friends, asian stereotypes will be mentioned

&amp;nbsp;

i'm not a debbie downer who "DEMANDS" that destiny needs to stop this,
but i think he has some internal explaining to do when a majority of his stream revolves around this type of edgynes, and i dont think it gets cleared up with the old it's just "jokes" meme.
                                
&amp;nbsp;

**EDIT:** to expand a bit more:
Yes these are all jokes, and irony can be powerful and helpful tool when used intelligently. but i see a big discrepancy between what he's passionately arguing for and the sheer frequency of edgynes he is displaying as a public figure. i myself make those jokes but i try to consciously tone it down since my realization couple years ago. but destiny seem to think "its just a joke" or the once a month "these are my actual views" lectures excuses it all especially i dont see a conscious effort to regulate this behavior.
And i think this somewhat expanded to his fanbase: holding somewhat progressive views while being fairly entertained by vile racism on 4chan or ICE poseidons IRL streams. And picking up the meme of calling every female a THOT etc.

&amp;nbsp;

**my last edit sorry:**
People dont seem to get my point, maybe the same people laughing at the guy in the blue eyes video yesterday "he just dont get it man". Yes its all jokes, destiny doesn't hate the "blacks" and the women. But i question a world where everyone is ironically racist or bigoted and especially in that frequency destiny and some of you displaying.

I think we all agree that this sub has become a circle jerk of leftism. Only a few brave voices among us have dared to speak out against the main stream, that is a relatively tiny twitchstreamers subreddit. 

And so, for the sake of open and unbiased discussion I have decided to do my part right here and now:

The Earth is actually flat and you are all just falling for the world conspiracy that is spun by NASA!

Too long has this sub been only talking about "real" science. Don't you see how biased this is, just dismissing any facts you can't stand as not "real"?? 

It is time that finally this sub becomes some alternative facts to chose from against all these "scientific" stuff that gets gargled up here every day. 

Anyhow I personally don't care about my own downvotes so I might come back in the future after I've acquired some comment karma. All I'm really interested in is having fun/memeing and having productive thought-provoking discussions about whether or not the earth is flat.I remember him talking about doing some sort of psychedelic while he was out of town but haven't seen any follow up. Did I miss something?When you get to the very far edge of Right Wing Media the lines of what's blatantly racist and what is just hyper-conservative gets blurry. And no one has tapped into that better than Lauren Southern.

Now the question is of course, is Lauren Southern a racist? The short answer is yes. But she is an interesting case because unlike the Jared Taylors or Richard Spencers she is not obvious about it, but then unlike someone like Milo she isnt nessecarily denying it either.

But to get your head around Lauren you have to first get your head around the company she keeps, now apologies in advance because we are going to be talking about some youtubers you probably don't give a shit about.


First **James Allsup**, I think there was probably a time when he was just a basic bitch libertarian but the guy is about as racist as they come now.

[Exhibit A] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzWIs1zNx2U&amp;t=196s)

By the way, feel free to ask him a very respectful question explaining why he was there and acting the way he was (praising david duke, and fangirling for richard spencer) and he will be sure to block you on twitter.

[Exhibit B] (https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2017/08/15/25349868/wsu-student-james-allsup-wrote-hateful-posts-on-facebook-before-he-went-to-charlottesville)

this is just a magazine article about his overall nasty views but pay attention in particular to the anti-semetic shit where he starts saying jews aren't white and he can identify them by their 'big noses'.

[Exhibit C] (https://dailystormer.name/james-allsup-debates-a-race-denialist-on-race-realism/)

And yes, just in case you needed final proof he is a race realist and does judge people by skin colour. But tbh he advocates this a few different times in various streams and unrelated debates that you could find if you do some digging.


Now on to **Brittany Pettibone**, she is very much in line with these views. American Identitarianism is a very fancy way of saying white nationalist. Its the idea that your identity (race, ethnicity) informs everything important about you and they cant be separated. So while you might be a civic nationalist and a proud right wing black who feels you can assimilate perfectly with right wing western culutre. Indentitarianism flies in the face of that. It will declare that as a black you have genetic pre-disposition not only to negative behavioral traits and low I.Q. but also to in-group preference where you will always end up advocating for your race over others.

If this sounds pretty fucking stupid  its because it is.

Here is Brittany, James and Martin all covering and agreeing with these talking points. Note when Martin denoucnes civic nationalism and says you cant separate culture from ethnicity at 7:40

[Racist Roundtable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJO_PkLJUHU)

Brittany has referenced these ideas in other videos and trust me when she talks about the 'western' or the 'european' man to rise up and sacrafice everything to protect their land. She is talking about whites and whites only.

So yes, its a lot to read and watch but those 3 are undoubtedly all racist.

Now on to **Lauren**. I honestly do believe either she is a racist, or she is just extremely clever at marketing to racists. But one thing I will say is that she walks the line very carefully. As of today I will not find Lauren calling herself a white nationalist or advocating for an ethnostate. BUT the martin Sellner guy that you found creepy actually met Brittany through Lauren. Because Lauren was working with and promoting his organisation (Generation Identity).

Now with an honest  and objective lens on, tell me it isn't a little bit troubling that she is behind people like this, these are people who dont want people who look like you if your'e brown to live in Europe and definitely don't want you race mixing with white people.

[Birds of  Feather Flock Together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgwerO355t0)

Also the fact that she is pallying around with not only Brittany and Sellner but fucking FAITH '14 Words' GOLDY paints a disturbing picture.

[Proximity to real racists.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWJyON5rMKk000)

and also shes a race realist, to me that's evidence enough of racial bigotry but check out what she says 
[at 2:02 here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcsDSPLkyU0)

And here...you can tell it was almost edited out, but you can catch it if youre paying attention where she says that white lineage and genetics really do matter.

[at 7:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7wHWob4pkU)

So yeah I'm not blaming anyone for being confused about Lauren, because you have to a do quite a bit of digging to get to here. But I've had the time to really comb through this. Separating the regular right wing with the bold racists that have popped up in the last 3 years or so.

Let me know what you think after you've seen the links.I’ve seen a lot of criticism and concerns about what this subreddit is turning into lately and I wanted to add my own take. I’m more looking to explain why this subreddit is the way that it is opposed to how it should be.


There are a good chunk of users here that came because of the debates Destiny used to do.  If I’m gonna be honest with myself (and I expect I’m not alone in this sentiment) I did not come here because I’m interested in what the right has to say on social issues or anything for that matter. I and others originally got drawn here because we’re addicted to that cathartic release when some of these idiots get dunked on.


And let’s get this one thing straight, this is not a debate sub. No one owes anyone anything here in terms of serious discussions, there are plenty of other subreddits that focus on providing that kind of environment. Few if any people here are seriously interested in what Loldamar, or exskillsme, or numbers has to say as much as they would like to see how someone else tears them down. I’d like to show my appreciation for our village idiots, for being our punching bags, and if they need a break then let them leave. There are plenty of other subs where you can find similar idiots.


And in response to those crying about how much of an echo chamber this place is becoming, I’d argue that this sub hasn’t changed much at all recently except that we have one less dumbass to point our finger at and laugh (though let’s be real we’re all gonna miss mashing that downvote button whenever loldamar said anything). If anything this sub is probably more diverse than people assume, I’m willing to bet there’s a good mix of leftists, liberals, and neolibs here that probably have quite a bit they disagree on, but no one came here to discuss those things. This place is as much as an echo chamber as any other subreddit so gargle my nuts

Ignore the punching memes. Is this simply a spicy twitter meme, or a provocation of a deeper question?

Honest question for the SJW circlejerk breakers in this sub (/u/exskillsmeh and 3ish others): what is your take on the current presidential (ab)use of powers?

Would you be cool with adding more limits to presidential powers?

Klappa.So here's this weeks spreadsheet, just a couple things before you ask.

1. % of total time is &gt;100% because of overlap of multiple things (discussions while playing games for example)
2. If you want to sort the columns, click file&gt;download as and download the spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CSFIYTe6Dh2WDTYabjyxRw520ycpTsIa7nG7uko-jos/

Also, Hillshire has put together an awesome site related to the spreadsheet here

https://infinite-cliffs-94665.herokuapp.com/

You can sort by category/topic, navigate the vod by parts, filter out parts of the stream you don't want to see, and there are links to timestamps for everything. The site searches for my post every 3 hours so this weeks spreadsheet should be on there within 3 hours from this post.

I'll be updating that throughout the week, no promises or anything as far as keeping it up to date daily but if you want to bookmark that and check back from time to time, there ya go.https://mobile.twitter.com/PaulsEgo/status/1003716116701761542I've been researching pesticides all day, and there's too much information.  Here's a summary of what I've found, in threeand articles/studies:

First, [https://extension.psu.edu/potential\-health\-effects\-of\-pesticides](https://extension.psu.edu/potential-health-effects-of-pesticides)

This is an introduction to the different types of problems pesticides can introduce.  A few important things to take away are:

**Hazard** \(risk\) while dealing with pesticides is mentioned a lot through studies.  The basic idea is "Hazard = toxicity x exposure".  We want to minimize Hazard, meaning we either want very low toxicity or very low exposure, or both obviously.

Another thing to take away from this article is the two main styles of Toxicity, **Acute Toxicity** and **Chronic Toxicity**.

Imagine you worked on a farm and were dealing with large amounts of pesticides every day.  If you consume a teaspoon of pesticide and die, that's referred to as **Acute toxicity**.  This is something that's not debated and considered highly dangerous, the article actually goes into the warning system developed.

The other style, Chronic Toxicity, is what us normies would experience.  This is classified as a long\-term exposure to the active ingredient \(i.e. pesticide\).  "Any harmful effects that occur from small doses repeated over a period of time are termed 'chronic effects'".

Okay, that's great an all.  Now I know what to google, I'm interested in **Chronic Toxicity**, meaning what **Chronic Effects** if any will I experience by just eating things like fruits, vegetables.  Studies showing me long term effects are what are interesting to me.

Here's a study titled "Chronic dietary exposure to pesticide residues in the United States": [https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40550\-015\-0018\-y](https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40550-015-0018-y)

From the "Results" section:

&gt;A total of 77 specific pesticides were detected from market basket samples of 2240 TDS food items analyzed by FDA in 2004 and 2005. All estimated exposures to the 77 pesticides for the General US population were well below chronic RfD levels. Only 3 of the 77 pesticides showed exposures greater than 1 &amp;#37; of chronic RfDs, while 14 showed exposures between 0.1 and 1 &amp;#37; of chronic RfDs and 19 had exposures between 0.01 and 0.1 &amp;#37; of chronic RfDs. The remaining 41 pesticides had exposures below 0.01 &amp;#37; of chronic RfDs.  
&gt;  
&gt;Compared with 1986–1991 findings, dietary exposure to six environmentally persistent chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides were reduced by factors of 47 to 96 &amp;#37; in 2004–2005. Exposures to 15 different population subgroups were estimated and indicated that children, particularly two year\-olds, frequently receive higher exposures to pesticide residues in their diets than do adults.

And the "Conclusion" section

&gt;Chronic dietary exposure to pesticides in the diet, according to results of the FDA’s 2004–2005 TDS, continue to be at levels far below those of health concern. Consumers should be encouraged to eat fruits, vegetables, and grains and should not fear the low levels of pesticide residues found in such foods.

So, this seems to paint a fairly positive picture.  Again, I think this is all acknowledging pesticides are harmful to humans.  However, the dosage that a normal person would expect to receive in their normal diet is so low that it doesn't pose a concern.  I think this is something that people may get tripped up on, because no matter how **toxic** something is, if your **exposure** to it is very small, it doesn't make much of a difference.  Bonus meme: [Drinking Cyanide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1rUw21MIII)

Now, what's confusing me is this release:

[http://www.iarc.fr/en/media\-centre/iarcnews/pdf/MonographVolume112.pdf](http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/iarcnews/pdf/MonographVolume112.pdf)

In short, it states that the herbicide glyphosate \(and insecticides malathion and diazinon\) are "probably carcinogenic to humans".  This is important, because glyphosate is probably the most widely used herbicide today, for various reasons.  Like we've discussed already, we all agree that pesticides/herbicides/insecticides/whatever can be very dangerous substances, especially in large doses \(Acute Toxicity\).

The studies this release draws from are focused on cancer in laboratory animals \(mice\).  The EPA's conclusion on the same studies were originally "possibly carcinogenic to humans" in 1985, and later changed to "evidence of non\-carcinogenicity in humans" in 1991.  So, this IARC group is looking at the same study and is concluding that "there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity".

TLDR;  Are pesticides bad?  Sources would be nice.  I'm a little skeptical of "Organic" or "Natural" pesticides, because nature fallacy \( I would like each pesticide to be evaluated on its own\) and I'm tired of the marketing hype around Organic products.  However, if it's legitimate I'd like to know.So this is a link to my playlist (5 short videos).  I hope you enjoy! Not really trying to self-promote, except to maybe get Destiny/Alt Hype's attention.

Cheers!

**Guest**: blatantly racist statement

**Destiny**: WHOA, my dude, that sounds kinda racist, maybe, just a little bit—

**Guest**: Oh my God, typical lib, calling everything you don't like racist. The facts show blacks are 30% more inferior.The ripperino cappucino etc bit?I care about health and the environment so I don’t consume as many animal products as most people but I am not vegan. My argument revolves around intellect+might makes right+social contract. So the first question is what level of intellect is the threshold and would it be ok for an alien race to kill/torture me if they were “smarter”. The threshold is the intellect/awareness of a human who isn’t mentally retarded. No I don’t care if mentally handicapped humans are killed/tortured and yes I would accept this fate for myself if I became handicapped except for the torture part. Since I say torture gets under my skin that’s where you’d think I’d go ahead and become vegan but that’s where might makes right comes in as my shield. I don’t believe in objective morality, whoever has the most power wins in the end. To this one may say now I’m advocating for a world that would be inconvenient for me but that’s where social contract comes in. As humans we usually respect each other’s well being. I don’t have to worry about being killed for consuming animal products. But doesn’t this logic justify the aliens doing whatever they want to me? No because intellect comes into play again. I would respect non human life forms if they’re past the threshold even if I was near omnipotent and what not in which case I could get away with doing anything to them.

There are very few lobbies and interest groups for stupid and poor white men, markets don't favor them either.In Destiny's most recent YT video he answers a bunch of questions from users of a discord.

After ~3 hours it jumps to a previous conversation with a dude (robot/alien/etc) who goes to question Destiny on just about everything. A big chink of it was him talking with Destiny about how Destiny trys to become the best at sex. He 'takes notes' and seems to be recording the data on his computer.

At first I thought it was just a viewer who came to troll or verbally shit post. But the further it went the more I believed it and wanted to believe it. At the end no ruse was revealed, he simply thanked Destiny for the data and left.

Who is the dude? I tried reading chat every once and a while to see who he was or if it was a troll. Most of the comments on where shit like:

"His mothership will be pleased when he reports back with this information" and a shitload of LULs and it's respective variants.

**tl;dr** who ta fuk is dis niqqa?
Look I love you, but I would also like to understand you.summoning /u/NeoDestinyDestiny I've been a long time watcher of yours but I feel the need to speak out about the psychological torture that you are inflicting upon MrMouton on a daily basis. It may not be apparent to you, because you are a well known psychopath, but these psychological mind games are taking a toll on MrMouton and I am afraid that he is headed to a dark place where he will do something regrettable.**The following is a post a made for r/hiphopheads. When I talk about *this* or that sub, I am referring to r/hiphopheads**

I know this is old news, but no one ever spoke on this it seems. Essentially it shakes down to this: I'm not racist is a song where two characters share their perspective. The problem is that one is horribly racist, and the other is a frustrated black guy's response to everything said.

When I first watched the video, I pretty much understood what was up. The first perspective is that of a racist white guy, but the sentiments are common. He lays out every talking point I have ever heard white people say about black people. The second is Joyner's perspective. It is his response to this.

The fucked up part of all this is this sub's sentiment towards the video. Now I get it "you can't judge an entire sub by one thread." Actually you can, because in that thread the same moronic ass sentiment was upvoted and dissenting opinion was downvoted. This isn't one guy or a few people's take, this is the sub coming to an agreement on the meaning of "I'm not racist."

The sentiment is as follows: "both perspectives are factual. Both sides are racist. Both sides have things wrong with them etc. Joyner's opinion probably falls in somewhere in between. He probably agrees with what the white guy said as well as the black guy. We should just come to a compromise between the two view points."

Obviously this is extremely stupid, but this is what happened in the song thread. On top of all this, the general sentiment sided with the white guy! When I first watched the video I immediately hated it, not because the message is bad, it isnt, but because I knew that all my white friends would nod in agreement with the white guy and go "yup yup, he spitting truth." This sub did the exact same.

Now along comes the genius lyric video. Joyner says exactly what every non-idiot figured he would say. He categorically disavows everything said in the first verse, and the second verse is essentially his entire opinion. No one ever made a thread about this part even though it spells out everything wrong with r/hiphopheads take on it. 

All in all, I don't really have a discussion question or anything to jump off into. I don't have a massive point to making this thread. There are a ton of racists/idiots in this sub, but this isn't a shock to anyone. I suppose this is a thread for down the line so that if anyone searches for the song on this sub they will see this. I just think it's a shame that every refutation in the original thread was downvoted and tons of vile garbage was upvoted. 

Have a good day boys

**TL;DR**: *Joyner's point is that you aren't supposed to agree with the white guy, the second part of the verse is intended to counter and respond to the first first. It isn't just a second viewpoint, it is intended to be a refutation of the first verse, not a joining of the arguments of the two verses. Joyner does not want to compromise with the first verse, he doesn't want to "take the good bits from it." There are no good bits in the first verse according to Joyner. He fundamentally disagrees with the arguments of the white guy.*Should there be a ban on raping and murdering people until at least the age of 18?

Is this being way too extreme way too quickly?Ironically of courseI've made a few observations:

- There is a massive amount of cognitive dissonance, mainly the contradiction between craving female sex / attention / acceptance, and hating all females for not getting it. They will call females stupid animals that just want to fuck hot guys, and in the same paragraph express the desire to kill themselves for above reasons

- Anecdote is King. See a fb post with a girl saying she ignores short guys / likes being treated badly / would bang a sociopath / other retarded thing? YOU MUST EXTRAPOLATE TO ALL FEMALES

- The echo chamber is insanely strong. Disagreeing that all women are like this is instant downvote-into-oblivion territory. There does appear to be disagreement with some of the more extreme ideas, such as violence, a return to patriarchy, and harassment against women, as posts will have varying levels of support

Honestly I don't know what to do, I originally planned to practice conversing with them, try and change some opinions, but they seem so far gone I don't even know how to begin. 

How do you begin to converse with someone currently taking the koolaid intravenously? 

Shoutout to /u/Betachad69 for at least trying to converse outside of that black holeHoly fuck this cuts deep. I watched Destiny from when he first started. He seemed so genuine and quirky. He was that dumb autistic guy who had no friends. Someone I could relate to... Then as time went on and when he moved onto youtube, he became more upfront with his motives.

You could all begin to see the changes. He once relied on this community for happiness apparently, since he had no friends. For me, a viewer, it used to be about just tagging along with Destiny as he explores IRL. Its not about that anymore.

The streams have become tailored for revenue. The recycled 24 hour streams, the fake drama, the blatant money grabs like sponsored streams, the terrible sponsorships like 0vvn3d.
i feel like I had a friend in the beginning. i stuck around for so long because i really did feel like I had a close friend. now its all different. i feel like just another consumer, just part of a business cycle.

When is Destiny gonna play Fortnight with Felix from Chapo Trap House? 
They can meme on Ben Shapiro. Felix has read Ben's homo erotic spy novels. In light of recent news.After seeing the recent random ama destiny did with that guy on discord where he asked destiny various questions about his sex life, it gave me a brilliant meme move to pull on destiny. Someone starts asking him random questions like that guy but about things like the size of destinys garden, how many garden ornaments there are, and how much protection he has from pests etc. They then ask him how many gnomes he wants for his garden, and what type of gnomes.It seems like it became one of the biggest thing now mocking "manlets". I'm 5'11" and I get regularly told on the net that I'm a manlet. Wtf is wrong with people?http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/letter-to-peter-collinson/ - Ben Franklin

&gt;“Those who come hither are generally of the most ignorant Stupid Sort of their own Nation.”

&gt;“Not being used to Liberty, they know not how to make a modest use of it.”

&gt;“[T]he Spaniards, Italians, French, Russians and Swedes, are generally of what we call a swarthy Complexion; as are the Germans also, the Saxons only excepted.”

&gt;“The influx of foreigners must, therefore, tend to produce a heterogeneous compound; to change and corrupt the national spirit; to complicate and confound public opinion; to introduce foreign propensities.”

&gt;"The United States have already felt the evils of incorporating a large number of foreigners into their national mass;"

&gt;"In the infancy of the country, with a boundless waste to people, it was politic to give a facility to naturalization;3 but our situation is now changed. It appears from the last census, that we have increased about one third in ten years;4 after allowing for what we have gained from abroad, it will be quite apparent that the natural progress of our own population is sufficiently rapid for strength, security and settlement. By what has been said, it is not meant to contend for a total prohibition of the right of citizenship to strangers, nor even for the very long residence which is now a prerequisite to naturalization, and which of itself, goes far towards a denial of that privilege. The present law was merely a temporary measure adopted under peculiar circumstances and perhaps demands revision.5 "

However, they didn't even go as far as Trump, which is the amazing thing. They were suggesting a 5-year transition to citizenship, that naturalization could happen pretty shortly. I think you could argue even that they would be seen as too lenient on immigration by today's standards, and they were literal 18th and early 19th century backwards racists!

Ready to transition away from twitch to full\-time YouTube streamer PEPE.Just taking a temperature.

It seems like there's been an uptick in political memes that have little or nothing to do with Destiny. I have no issue with the Ben Shapiro/Jordan Peterson, and YouTube skeptic 'du jour' memes, since those are all people discussed regularly on stream. Lily, MrMouton, and Bunny memes make sense. 

But take a look at the front page rn (I'm not sure if I'm allowed to link to other posts via Reddit rules):

- A Canadian cop yelling at a road rage incident.

- A link to a random Reddit alt-right troll account

- A meme about the Ontario election

- A news story about Jill Stein

To me these seem like a bit of a stretch, but several are highly upvoted. Are we just /r/Fuckthealtright and /r/enoughpetersonspam now? 

Not mad, just curious. Do we want more Destiny-related content in a Destiny sub, or do we rely on the "liberated bazaar of concepts" to sort out the posts?With the World Cup less than a week away, I thought I'd gauge interest here on a DGG tournament predictor league as a few of us in chat have been talking about it. I've created one here: [https://predictor.fifa.com/match/leaguejoin/db2e4227](https://predictor.fifa.com/match/leaguejoin/db2e4227) and about a dozen of us are in so far. 

If we get 30 or more playing by the first match next week, I'll consider doing prizes for top 3 finishers at the end if people are interested (so try to reg with similar to chat names). Further real time ideas/discussion/organization held here: [https://discord.gg/CMqQZyz](https://discord.gg/CMqQZyz)

Where is this from? Does anyone know

It's the one at 6:05With steams new "Anything goes policy" people have been screaming everything from "they are trying to dodge responsibility" to "they are enabling the racist, sexist and that guy who used to bully me in the first grade". 

Personally, I prefer this to them moderating content for anything sexual that falls outside of "what is allowed" and or "offensive". That said, their vague rule on "Troll Games" seems to be how they are going to remove some games that just cross the line (AIDS simulator is gone), but I wish they made some sort of statement or rule about quality. As many of you know I am against what leftist circle Jerk this sub has become, and now with even Destiny himself complaining about, it's time that we get some new and fresh opinions in here. 

You all know that the earth is actually flat. That much should be obvious by now. What nasa doesn't tell you is where oil actually comes from. 

I am an Oil truther and as such I have discovered the shocking truth! At the edge of our world where the sky dome meets the disk, the Saudis have started harvesting the black oil-paint that makes up our night sky! Or do you really think its a coincidence that since we use "fossil" fuel the night sky has become less and less dark??? Wake up sheeple! 

Once the night sky is depleted the saudis will drain our blue sky to get the oil! You will believe me once fuel has turned blue and you look up in a dim gray sky each morning!

Anyhow I personally don't care about my own downvotes so I might come back in the future after I've acquired some comment karma. All I'm really interested in is having fun/memeing and having productive thought-provoking discussions about whether or not the earth is flat.I went through the past broadcasts but it looks like it's gone.ok previously, minecraft was pretty boring because it devolved into the same shit over and over after every iteration.

HOWEVER

Imagine an all desert world with a DUNGEON MOD

http://mcdungeon.bubblemod.org/

http://mcdungeon.bubblemod.org/

http://mcdungeon.bubblemod.org/

In the year 2150, after the "Great Social Justice War" has resulted in a socialist controlled USA, you, as a fervent supporter of the SJW movement are confronted with the following:

After taking over of the total economy by the state, inevitable issues come up, the greatest being a serious lack of food production and security, resulting in the rationing of food.

Since you always considered yourself to be a proud supporter of the winning SJW movement, you complain about this rationing to your superior SJW commander.

They tell you that you have to be content with the little food you get, since the descendants of the "noble warriors" that fought in the Great War are of course getting the first pick and the most food. This is "logical", since they suffer the most from the traumas of their ancestors.

You cannot argue with this truism, so you and your family starve, but rest assured: it is for a good cause, to feed those that are higher on the moral ladder than you.The Distributist is a  right leaning political and cultural critiquing channel on youtube with a catholic perspective. He makes various videos and has done debates with Kristi Winters, mouthy bhudda and various other channels, and has made interesting videos that are generally pretty reasonable, making him a good guest on streams and various content. I  personally think it would be very interesting to hear Destiny's ideas vs his.    

His channel for those who are interested : [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdHT7KB1gDAXZYpPW71fn0Q](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdHT7KB1gDAXZYpPW71fn0Q)The reason women gobble up Feng Shui, healing crystals, and all that other bullshit like pigs at a trough, is because their vaginas aren’t worth shit after the age of 26.

They need something to fill the gap.

Don’t believe me? When was the last time a woman over 26 didn’t lie to you about her age?

All human beings need a purpose. We need to have something to give, because it means we get something in return. That’s human nature. We men can feel good about ourselves without being promiscuous whores because as men we have skills and ideas instead of positions and tongues. That’s also human nature.

That’s how the laws of economics apply to the job market. What a manly thing for me to have just said.

That’s also what the Smurfs was all about: in a perfect world, everyone has a job and doing that job means a bunch of other jobs get done for you. As a man, I understand that. The only philosophies women draw from the Smurfs are that it’s okay to fuck a hundred guys, and that anyone who cares more about the Smurf berries getting eaten by an ogre than pining to fuck the only girl in town is gay.

Straight guys have to eat too. Eating is like sports and having one last pint. To men, they’re both more important than getting laid.

All men have a purpose. I’m hilarious and everything I say is a supernova of truth. That’s my purpose. Women, however, exist to get fucked. Actually, I take that back. That’s only true until they’re 27. After that it’s a desperate slide into Hocus Pocus and expensive baloney.

Mature Women’s Studies (ages 27 and over)

101: Psychics and Clairvoyance (ages 27-32)

The first step to getting a degree at the Women’s Academy of Mystical Bullshit is to believe in psychics with all of your little heart.

The reason women believe in clairvoyance is because they need to have something to give. A 27 year old vagina isn’t something to give anymore, it’s something that needs care. It needs to be tagged as un-marriable and checked into a convalescent home. Without their vaginas, women cling to a world of clairvoyance and foresight like bits of shit onto a sinking toilet.

“If I believe in psychics, doesn’t that make me a psychic?” says a woman. “Doesn’t that mean I have something to give?”

No. You don’t have to be psychic to spot a cougar from twenty paces.

201: Feng Shui, Tarot, and Horoscopes (ages 33-38)

Feng Shui is the art of a woman turning her fuck-ups into a stockpile of Karma, and her husband’s success into the depths of her understanding of a cheap-shit wheel made in China.

If women read enough books on this kind of crap, they all figure out the same thing: nothing ever was anyone’s fault, men aren’t better than women, and no man has ever succeeded because of hard work and dedication. It was because he was born on a Tuesday.

No, ladies. It was because he was born with a cock.

The Chinese have a saying about Feng Shui. Roughly translated, it goes, “white women should shut their fucking mouths.”

301: Magical Healing (ages 39-45)

There are many types of magical healing, but there has only been one Jesus.

The difference between Jesus and every woman who has ever picked up a book on healing crystals, acupuncture, Reiki, aromatherapy, homeopathy, magnetic healing, aura therapy, faith healing, therapeutic touch, and anything else that starts with a sucker and ends with a bill, is that Jesus was remembered after he died. That can’t be said for any woman who has ever owned a book on how to be a reverse Bogeyman.

That’s women in their 40’s for you: just as dumb as women in their 20’s.

401: Angels (ages 46 and over)

As a man, you can have opinions and lengthy discussions about religion. As a woman, you can shut the fuck up about religion because you don’t know what you’re talking about.

A miracle is when a 747 doesn’t crash into an orphanage. A miracle is when you get shot in the head and it somehow misses your brain. A miracle is not Jesus Take the Wheel by Carrie Underwood — nor is a miracle any other sob story about some dumb cunt who couldn’t understand a cell phone bill let alone a dogmatic philosophy.

Angels are not the man you couldn’t please long enough to stick around and take care of you. They live in heaven. Why would they give a shit that you locked your keys in your car.

Manclusion

All women lie about their age. To narrow down the number, ask her which of the above topics sounds most appealing. Toss in the Socratic Method as a laugh. If she thinks you meant Hollister or Abercrombie and Fitch, order up a round of Rufitini’s on me. She’s just right.To freshen up the sub a little, I thought I'd ask some philosophical questions now and then. Very thought-provoking questions in particular.

Firstly, what are the criteria for intelligence? What are the necessary components for defining consciousness? The "Turing Test" is often cited as a prototypical test of intelligence, although it is almost universally regarded as insufficient. It involves a conversation between a sentient being and a machine, and if the being can't tell he is talking to a machine, it is considered intelligent. A well trained machine, however, could theoretically "parrot" its way through the test. This raises the corollary question of whether it is possible to artificially create consciousness (usually in the context of computers or machines), and of how to tell a well-trained mimic from a sentient entity.

A related field is the ethics of artificial intelligence, which addresses such problems as the existence of moral personhood of AIs, the possibility of moral obligations to AIs (for instance, the right of a possibly sentient computer system to not be turned off), and the question of making AIs that behave ethically towards humans and others.harkdan posted a Hhhehhehe in chat so let's appreciate that

Proof: https://imgur.com/a/9Y1tXaNA gnomon ([ˈnoʊmɒn], from Greek γνώμων, gnōmōn, literally: "one that knows or examines") is the part of a sundial that casts a shadow. The term has come to be used for a variety of purposes in mathematics and other fields.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GnomonI have no legsWe ran out of debate memes and thus, we're bored and started posting other political shit. You should've expected that when you say that you will do less political debates. 

You are like the only one who can debate The Alt-Right Race Realist Retard crowd without falling into the far-left Marxist Vegan Memes. Of course you'd get people who expect more from you. 

If you don't like shit content, /u/NeoDestiny, then give what the people want: Debates.

PS: And like I've said, If you're scared about doxxing and other shit if you go back to debating, then consider leaving the US. Tonka wouldn't even be able to call The FBI if you're living with Kristi Winters in Germany or some shit (and like the RCMP the FIS doesn't accept Skype and foreign calls). Hell, with that Twitch money you can even send Nathan to an American school overseas, giving him a better life and perspective that many Americans don't get. Trust me, [Milo Yiannopoulos and /r/european tried to dox me when I was living in France and they still failed](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/21/reddit-mod-squeals-in-panic-how-do-i-stop-people-talking-about-immigration/). You can get away with it, you know.I know Nazis/Anti-SJWs/Skeptics/Alt-Right/Kekistanis/Anti-Feminists shut down the debate videos through flagging and censorship but for real though I need that crack. 
Does Destiny got like some owns I can mainline? If only Anti-SJWs/Anti-Feminists weren't such scum bags. I really enjoy seeing people trash them in debates. I voted for Trump and still support him. I don't live in a city, I don't buy into the need to be politically correct anytime you say anything, I work in an industry that liberals are against. You only see what the media presents to you, a media that has been very anti-trump. Trump could cure cancer and the media would spin it as Trump putting doctors and pharmaceutical companies out of business. I believe in USA first instead of pandering to other countries. Illegal aliens are a drain on taxpayers (such as myself), if you want to come here, come here legally. Having an open door is not a sustainable way to run a country. I support the 2nd amendment and own several guns, something liberals are against. You can say he's imcompetent, but I'm paying less in taxes, unemployment is down, there's talks of the Korean war ending (yes Trump's sanctions helped to initiate those talks).Personally loved the film. A great horror movie. I did not like the actor for the character Peter. A lot of his scenes were way too over the top, especially when he cries. It literally made the whole theatre laugh. On the topic of laughing, a lot of the scenes in this movie were fucking hilarious. I was confused though, I was not sure whether or not it was meant to be funny or not... Anyway, 8/10 movie from me.

Seriously, please, stop with the constant JP spam. Not even Destiny cares about this circlejerk of a subreddit anymore. This is the reddit equivalent of playing LoL.Ok, for those who don't care about reactionaries and don't know who she is, Lauren Southern is a reactionary with sizable audience of over half a million youtube subscribers. I think [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/8o4ofy/the_not_so_obvious_ethnonationalism_of_lauren/) post on /r/neoliberal goes into detail why she and her believes are so abhorrable.

Well it turns out she likes Dugin

https://twitter.com/Lauren_Southern/status/1004514700783022080

Who is this Dugin guy? Well, he is Neo-Eurasianist. WTF does that mean? I think I will let this description speak for itself.

[Boiled down, his idea is like this. Russia possesses a distinct cultural code that makes it strive for expansion and domination, no matter what. Other nations are hardwired to prevent this and destroy Russia. We must obey our destiny and grow larger and mightier. Either that, or we die.](https://www.quora.com/What-does-Dima-Vorobiev-think-of-Dugin-and-his-neo-Eurasianism)

This is not a description made by some "sjw", mind you. This is a description made by a non-ideological Russian nationalist!

Why I am posting this? It's interesting case that demonstrates how these western reactionaries "progressed" over the years of the migration crisis.

Islam bad -&gt; foreign culture bad -&gt; western liberalism bad -&gt; civil nationalism bad -&gt; ethnically "pure", but non-expansionary nationalism bad! All hail white Russian empire!So I basically need to be always listening, watching, or playing something. I've gotten into podcasts more, and I've found NPR's Hidden Brain podcast to be a interesting little gem. Something I feel like Destiny would enjoy.

The podcast talks about the human mind and psychology and does it in the standard NPR (National Public Radio for non USA memers) storytelling fashion. They end up talking about many things Destiny has touched on in his former debater life as well as new topics.

Destiny has always been super into psychology and the podcast talks to researchers. They go into racism, bias, tribal thinking, etc. I thought it could lead to interesting talks, maybe even non autistic debates. The podcast can inform and explain new topics dggers haven't thought about. Could do something like discuss a podcast a week as a discussion topic, almost book club style. I'm not sure what the policy on listening to the podcast on stream is though. It's NPR so it's public radio, but there's probably some copyright rules at play.

Just thought it might be an interesting and different idea. NPR is pretty unbiased and milquetoast as far as organizations go. They tend to play things pretty down the middle. They also do a pretty good job in the storytelling department. Here's just one podcast, but things from this episode touch on basically every debate he had.

https://www.npr.org/2018/03/09/591895426/the-mind-of-the-village-understanding-our-implicit-biases[Ground Zero](https://twitter.com/PaulsEgo/status/1003716116701761542)Wowee!

I don't know about y'all, but whenever I peruse through the sub, I notice that about 80&amp;#37; of the users are new names (as in never seen them in either Twitch chat or D.gg Chat). This made me curious as to the new demographic of the sub. So, here's [a Strawpoll](https://strawpoll.com/gr399a2a)

(note: the strawpoll is asking for the primary way you consume Destiny's content, so if you watch him on multiple platforms, then select the platform you use the most to watch Destiny's content.)Should kids be allowed to vote? Why? Why not?Now that I have your attention here is what I am really asking.

Everytime I see a discussion or debate about ethnostates the country Japan comes into play. People who advocate ethnostates seem to use Japan as an example of what they would like. A sense of community, tradition, communal values, history, culture, etc... And I notice that people who are against ethonstates usually disregard what they say by claiming look at Japan and their low birthrate, their economic problems, their work hours, their racism and other things. But many of these problems are not necessarily or at least not directly caused by the lack of diversity in Japan, but could be caused by other things.

So my question is, can you prove that the problems (that i have listed) are caused by the lack of diversity in the country? Also, are there other real problems that can hinder a country's progress that are caused by the lack of diversity?

 ** Does not have to hinder a country's progress, can just be problems caused by a lack of diversity.

Note: I am not a racist, supremacist or ethnostate advocate. I am simply curious. I have noticed that this subreddit is becoming circle jerky so I am trying to discuss something that I have not seen discussed on this subreddit. Any IRL streams connoisseur here?

Are they all like these and I am the problem?Does this translate to yi-yikes or yikes-yi. I feel like there is only one true answerSo here's this weeks spreadsheet, just a couple things before you ask.

1. % of total time is &gt;100% because of overlap of multiple things (discussions while playing games for example)
2. If you want to sort the columns, click file&gt;download as and download the spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gNIp6-BDKPG0iGOrTrm-0TNhJFIzXHCBzQJCljPor1Q/

You can sort by category/topic, navigate the vod by parts, filter out parts of the stream you don't want to see, and there are links to timestamps for everything. The site searches for my post every 3 hours so this weeks spreadsheet should be on there within 3 hours from this post.

However, there was a recent [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ContraPoints/comments/8oqpgx/jordan_peterson_the_fascist/) on her subreddit that took issue with this, making the claim that JBP is in-fact a fascist.  
Contra is a pretty reasonable leftist, so I figured her community would be willing to hear out dissenting views. I then submitted [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qT_YSPxxFJk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1h14m12s) link with the title 'JBP (so-called 'fascist' according to this sub) on white nationalism'.

It just makes bf not realistic at all.just give me a fucking idea where does this belief comes from? When, in which alternative reality, wasn´t AMERICA always first. This last century was about American supermancy over world´s politics. In the anals of modern history there never was anything else than "AMERICA FIRST".

It goes about as well as you'd expect. My favorite part is when he cites evidence that there is more leftist professors in University which proves Cultural Marxism exists. Never mind the fact that the key tenet of CM is the subversion aspect in which people are brainwashed into thinking erroneous things, leftist professors exist!  

Bonus meme: little to no evidence has been found that professors influence their students ideology.   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political\_views\_of\_American\_academics#On\_students](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_views_of_American_academics#On_students)

Extra bonus meme: this guy is going to attempt to debunk a Shaun video tonight. [https://twitter.com/TrueDilTom/status/1006597478760607744](https://twitter.com/TrueDilTom/status/1006597478760607744)As many of you know, the [destiny.gg](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gg.destiny.mobile) app on the play store has been available since December. As more of you know, it's widely considered to be trash. 

I think it's almost really good though. There are a handful of simple things that would improve user experience without a ton of work, and there are a few more things that need improving regardless of how much work that'll take. But if these ~10 things get fixed, I can see myself using this app daily. 



**SIMPLE FIXES:**
-

* Update the subscriber colors, they're currently the old color set

* Option to remove timestamp on all chat messages

* The private messaging system doesn't recognize emotes (But the destiny.gg messaging tab doesn't either, so this may be really hard)

* The back arrow in the top left of the in-app menus should be white, not black (((for easier visibility)))

* The Large emotes are cut into little boxes, free my boy [](/DuckerZ)

**MEDIUM FIXES:**
-

* The keyboard pops up over the bottom part of chat, move chat up so the keyboard doesn't cover the bottom message when you start typing

* The first message in an emote combo never goes away, ie [if three people type HmmStiny, the first is always visbile](https://i.imgur.com/qlBO8EL.png)

* Tapping a username contained within a chat message should add that username to my current drafted message, exactly like tapping their name from their recent message acts

* Make emotes larger in general, have them overshoot the lines they're contained within like they do on the full site; let emotes cover letters a bit. 

* **Load previous ~20 things said in chat every time the chat reloads**

**HARD FIXES:**
-

* Currently there is no autocorrect for any words at all when using the android keyboard to type in the app. I have no idea on what level this issue really is to fix, so it's probably really easy ie: tell android to use their own autocomplete/correct or really hard  ie: add your own autocomplete/correct library. But I have no idea

* This chat disconnects really easily. I'd love to stay connected when I tab to a different app for two seconds and come back, so I don't reconnect every time and lose the messages forever from between leaving the app and coming back to the app. This is of course difficult because I don't want my data being consumed forever while the app is open in the background. So a middle ground of keep loading everything in chat for ~60 seconds after I've last had the app open, in case I come back to it soon?

* Don't disconnect from chat when opening media links from the chat itself

* Fix [this bug](https://i.imgur.com/mCI1svf.png)

Honestly the largest issue with the app is the disconnections. The biggest thing to fix is the user experience around disconnecting. I know it'll be hard to work on the actual connection and disconnection issues, so do one or both of these and my issues with the app are at least halved:

* Hide the words "Disconnected. Connecting... Connecting... Connected. Server connections: X" which take up 4 lines total, and just throw a single one in there with the server connections after a brief loading screen or some shit. 

* As bolded above, load the things that were said just before you connect, so you never miss anything and aren't blind when you load chat for the first time in the day

I'm one of the few that use this app and don't hate it. I think it could be great with these changes, but it's possible they're all really hard or impossible and I'm retarded- or that I've missed the most needed change of all. Let me know in the comment section below \^.\^Are you guys blatant, all out SJW's or just rational skeptics^^tm who go full SJW at a certain point?


Ive seen Destiny on multiple occasions debating various things on other channels I watch and while I dont much like him you guys on here seem way more lefty and lame than he is. Mainly, you guys seemingly being against Tommy Robinson.Just wanted to say, I've been seeing a lot of people make fun of Peterson's 12 rules book and especially his advice to clean one's room. Well, first of all, Peterson didn't invent these "rules", I've been depressed and I've consulted a lot of different psychiatrists over the years and they all gave me advices like that. One of them made me promise that I would put my apartment in order and it seemed like a crucial thing for her. Another personal anecdote is that recently, as I was relapsing in depression and started heavy drinking, my parents decided to do something to help me, instead of sending me to another psy, my dad simply told me he would give me rules to follow (he doesn't know anything about Jordan Peterson btw). Told me the first thing I needed to do was to clean up my apartment, and I sort of did it. Funny thing, I didn't even clean up completely but just the act of obeying my father and believing in his rule as a token of my willingness to change triggered me into coming out of my depression. It took more than a few days to get there but it was definitely the turning point.

Bottom line is : You can make fun of Peterson all you want but just consider the fact that it's more than likely that his 12 rules are actually helping an awful lot of people getting out of depression. It provides them with a sort of romantic narrative. "Beating the chaos", feeling the "fatherly love", whatever, the point is : it works.

I'm all for making fun of Peterson's stupidity, his anti leftist conspiracy theory and his mystical absurdities, but that's not a reason to make fun of everything he says and does. A lot of what he says is just sound advice that clinical psychologists actually give. Making fun of that can have a very bad effect on psychology as a whole, as it will make people doubt the efficiency of such methods.I know some people are currently disappointed by what this subreddit has to offer and I was curious to know what percentage of this community shares the same thought.

Here is the poll: [https://www.strawpoll.me/15887700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n3pFFPSlW4)https://imgur.com/oPWypSpAnd yet you still doubt his greatness. Y'all are pathetic lol.About 6-7 days ago. I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my sister got her hair done. So there I am, sitting in the waiting area of a hair salon with my niece, and who walks in but Destiny himself.

I was nervous as shit, and just kept looking at him as he played Lords Mobile on his phone and waited, but was too scared to say anything to him. Pretty soon my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Steven, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asked what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So Destiny put down his phone, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of the hair salon. Chill guy, really nice about it.The North Korea - South Korea divide is a situation where a single ethnic group got split in half like a controlled experiment. 

Due to poverty, low nutrition, and low economic opportunity North Koreans score extremely low on IQ tests, unlike South Koreans. 

How doesn’t that massive controlled experiment of millions end the debate? How IQ testing is purely based on income, health, and  opportunity. aka Nurture I remember destiny comparing twitch vs a real job but I can't remember where it was at.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev3\-7HLcZ5o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev3-7HLcZ5o)[This post on /r/Conservative](https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/8qqw31/black_america_walking_off_the_cliffin_1950_the/) is currently hanging out on it's front page. Some bits:

&gt;For many years, I wondered why European Jews voluntarily marched into cattle cars to be shipped off to Nazi slaughterhouses.  How could they compliantly participate in their own destruction?  Why had so many lost the will to survive?  Or was it that so many thought their compliance would guarantee survival?  Some Jews thought not and fought to the death, like those in  the Warsaw ghettos, yet far too many didn't.  I always wondered why, until now.

----

&gt;From slavery until LBJ's War on Poverty programs, intact black American families were the norm.

----

&gt;The Jewish people survived the diaspora and Nazi genocide because of the prophetic plans of God.  He even brought them back to the Promised Land.  The only land for black Americans is America.  The only hope for the black family is complete repentance and a return to trusting in God. 

What the fuck am I reading?

Heya! Filthy youtube casual here. Went to the Destiny meetup last year and had a lot of fun! I know Destiny is back in SoCal, and I was wondering if those of you who follow the stream more closely than I know if there is any talk about another meetup this time? It was really fun to meet other viewers irl so I'm kinda hoping there is at least some chatter about it. Thx guys!senpai should get some good clothes, not just shorts and twitch shirts, also get a haircut and grow the full beard not just the goateeFirst off, by "anti" I mean your standard anti-sjw, gamerbro/whatever you want to call'em. 

With the recent flood of new games staring the women's, there has been a fairly loud shit show. People calling it a boom for social justice and people calling the cucking of the gaming industry. 

I've noticed that most of the former is coming from games media/third party and not as much the developers themselves. I believe that most of these people are trying to make fun games and not just trying to appease our feminist overlords. People who argue the latter are using the games media narrative as proof of their own. I thought we were not supposed to trust the gaming media? Not use sources like Polygon as examples or am I missing something?After hearing Devin (and I believe Steven now as well) make this argument:

"I may continue to eat meat because my impact on the environment is so small compared to the rest of the country, though I would continue to advocate for policy to help protect the environment"

Something irks me about this logic.  My fear is that this comparison is often used to sound charitable to yourself, but often this logic could be used to justify ridiculous things.

My two questions are,

1. When is a comparison to the sum of the population valid?

ex.  I can eat meat because compared to the rest of the population my impact is so insignificant.  \&lt;\-\- valid?

or\-  My test score was 100, but it was low because the sum of the classroom's score was 1000.  \&lt;\-\-\-Obviously Invalid???

   2.   When should we make comparisons to the average participant of a population?

ex.  My test score was 100, which is good compared to the class average of 79  \&lt;\-\-\-valid?

or \-  I should not eat meat because not eating meat has a large impact compared to the average person \&lt;\-\- valid?

We can also make some preposterous claims using similar logic as the original comment (though this gets into a moral thing) i.e.:

I can rape and torture because compared to the entire population my impact is so small  \&lt;\-\-\-\-  Most people agree invalid?

I can eat/torture animals because compared to the population my impact is so small \&lt;\-\-\- somehow more valid than the previous statement?

My real question is "When are comparisons to the population more suitable than comparisons to the average?" and vice versa.  In my opinion this is begin used as a convenient scape goat to market eating meat as "not that bad" when in reality I can make another valid comparison showing it's "fairly bad".Previously Destiny was very adamant about influencers being responsible for who they associate with and you can make a strong argument on Ice being just overall bad person. Doesn't Destiny have any moral qualms there?Nearly every time Destiny streams while driving with someone else in the car, that other person will express varying levels of surprise and distress at the way Destiny drives.

I've never been in a car with Destiny so I can't know for sure but from what I can tell, these are some driving habits that alarm his passengers:

1. He drives at a faster speed than some people are comfortable with.
2. He accelerates from a stop faster than some people are comfortable with.
3. He makes his turns more sharply and quickly '' '' ''.
4. When he comes to a stop, sometimes he brakes more sharply '' '' '' (but I think this one he only does to purposefully alarm his passengers).

[Watch Destiny's recent video with Lily and Aria in the car](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/272214333), they were freaking out at points, but they were also bantering pretty hard the whole ride so I can't tell how much they were actually distressed and how much was just a meme. Also it's hard to tell how much Destiny is amping up his aggressive driving tendencies for entertainment purposes/trolling his passengers. At least one point in the stream Destiny braked hard on purpose to alarm Lily/Aria just for funsies. I know Destiny is a responsible enough person to make sure there was no car anywhere near behind him when he did this, but I still find it a worrying habit.

Here's a clip of Destiny giving an analogy for some thing else that reminded me instantly about his driving streams: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdfoEKWet1o&amp;t=54m54s

In this analogy, Destiny's aggressive driving is the 4 year old poking someone in the dick, and Lily and Aria are the parents who say "omg like don't do that hahaha". Lily and Aria tell Steven to stop driving the way he does, make exaggerated reactions, look for something to grip in the car, but never really, really, seriously tell Steven to stop what he's doing. Destiny just keeps playing along with the "joke" and keeps driving aggressively.

The assumption is then that Lily and Aria are both just memeing and trust Destiny as a driver. If they didn't, and were sensible people, they would demand that he pull over immediately so they can get out of the car and call an Uber or something. If you really felt like the person driving the car you're in was driving dangerously, you would do more than "ahhhhh so scary wow please stop doin that lol".

So I just wanted to hear from people who have driven with Destiny: Lily, Aria, Chennerz, Erisann, MrMouton, Devin, Harkdan, etc. etc., what they really think about Destiny's driving. Is it an actual problem that he needs to address or is it just a fun meme for stream entertainment?

Another big problem I have with this is that there are a lot of people watching the stream, and I bet at least a few of them are gonna get the idea in their head "hey if I drive like this with girls in the car it will be a fun joke for everyone". And maybe those drivers aren't as safe as Destiny, and they take a hard turn in an intersection right into a pedestrian, or do a "brake check" and get rear ended.

edit: [I just finished watching the Ice/Destiny video...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdfoEKWet1o&amp;t=83m35s)when Ice Poseidon thinks your driving is too aggressive, I think there may be a problem.LOL

who did he destroy?
jontron? you mean the guy with a surface level fox news-tier understanding of politics?

destiny literally has gotten embarrassed everytime he tries to "debate" people that know what they're talking about.

against fucking shkreli of all people he literally had to do a 180 on the whole conversation because martin kept exposing how little he knew about their topic. so he changed the format of the "debate" into "just a conversation with shkreli".

against naked ape the study destiny kept referencing backfired on him when naked ape showed that he actually knew more about it than destiny. after ape's autism took hold and he started  to call him out for the dishonest straw-manning goal-post moving rambling fuck he was acting like, destiny quit the debate.

there's more instances by the way.

on what basis is he a good debater? because he tries to talk circles around people and strikes down arguments the other person didn't even make?

I as probably many have you noticed that destiny often times goes to some ridiculous lengths and accepting some insane statements in an effort to remain "consistent". See "skinning an animal alive is a morally neutral action" and similar memes.

I think its really interesting to point out the parallels that this sort of mindset has with folks like Stefan Molyneux (pre-alt-right days back when he was still ancap/libertarian) in their effort to maintain a strict philosophical worldview. His attempts to adhere to his own philosophy often led him to some pretty insane conclusions also. Probably the most notable was his insistence on de-fooing. [In this conversation with Joe Rogan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTRY7pUdENw#t=12m25s), he lays out his relatively reasonable defensible philosophical axioms which basically backs him into the corner of accepting the conclusion "cut anyone out of your life that is in support of 'the state' in any form", ie. pretty much anyone but the fringest of fringe anarchists. If you aren't interested in watching the video (pretty long), his worldview is more or less encapsulated by the following syllogism:

1: The state and taxation inherently represents coercion 

Molyneux points out that individual citizens MUST adhere to rules set forth by the state, it is 100% involuntary, including taxation, often times this money is used for purposes that most people would find morally repugnant (ie. foreign wars and the military industrial complex, the war on drugs and the prison industrial complex), and there is no option to opt out reasonably (I suppose unless you leave, but pretty much the entire world is comprised of states one way or another). Often times individuals have very little say in terms of not using this money for these purposes, even voting itself does little to change this (the war on drugs and the military industrial complex are more or less perpetuated by the "deep state" (individuals and groups in the government that are largely unelected and unaccountable in elections), look no further than America's foreign policy in the last 70 years, Democrat or Republican, the current par for the course in terms of foreign policy has remained unchanged).

2: Anyone that supports the state is de facto supporting coercion and/or violence against you.

Conclusion: It is a moral necessity or a moral good to disassociate with people that initiate violence or support violence against you.

Molyneux makes the argument that philosophy should be as close to a physical science as possible, ie. "exceptions" don't exist, philosophy should be universal, a position destiny would probably agree with. 

Personally, I don't think human beings are meant to be 100% consistent at all times, nor is it even desirable to be. Just something to think about.You have to get your mind in a more soothing mood.  So just play this tune from an ancient final fantasy game, aptly named "Into Darkness"

Before cutting into right wing trashy arguments.  It's a dirty mind numbing activity, the layers of stupidity you will have to endure is immense, you need something to calm frayed nerves.So, I caught a glimpse of the planning Japan YouTube video. one thing that should really be said is if they decide to go for more than a week / want to visit multiple cities then they really have to buy the JR rail pass. http://www.japanrailpass.net/en/index.html

This ticket gets you on all of the JR rail services, including the bullet train, as many times as you want during the period. For me as a resident of Japan a return trip to Osaka from Tokyo will cost around $300 dollars. The Rail pass costs about the same but it means you can take day trips / use the bullet train multiple times during a one week / two week period.

An example from last year when I was helping out sodapoppin/reckful was they decided on a sudden trip to the fox village (few hours north of Tokyo) and spent 600 bucks extra because they didn't have the pass. 

Im happy to give any help or advice if needed though.

 The backpack squire himself. Letting Steven use his backpack, helping with it and generally being a great friend.

https://i.redd.it/a2l41na1l2411.jpgRegions in the US are already like their desired liking. Why not move there or discuss it?To be more specific I’m attacking defects themselves as an argument. Most of the time you’ll just hear unrelated couples have defects as well or that it’s fine long as they don’t have a kid. You’re not really hurting anyone by giving them a handicapped life because under this context they didn’t even exist before. If they die young that also doesn’t matter logically. I would encourage related couples (even cousins) to get a sperm donation or adopt but even still it doesn’t matter if they don’t listen. Sure it would be bad if we had too many defects in the world but that’s never gonna happen just like homosexuals are never going to make humanity go extinct from not enough reproducing. I've been enjoying the strims, but there hasn't been a lot of lily and Steven just hanging out.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltMtmRuIi8w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltMtmRuIi8w)  


Is Paul Manafort relying on a pardon from Trump?   
Will Trump even pardon him and risk scrutiny from the public?  
Let's not forget Mueller is right on Trump's trail, but will the evidence sway Republicans to impeach Trump?  
Where is Melania?

All will be revealed on the next episode of House of Cards.Ya dumbfucksMy bestest friend ever left me yesterday and now I'm all alone what can I do so I can atleast feel a little better and not dread the idea of waking up in a world that has nothing left for meI know he's discussed podcasts before, but a lot of his shit doesn't need to be watched for visuals. There's obviously the vlog like content or reaction ones, but the rest? I can do with just the audio. What y'all think?I want to buy that car so I can emulate daddy Destiny going to LA will have massive positives for his stream. Dude was on Ice's stream, hanging out with the offlineTV crew, and now is pulling almost 25k viewers with Reckful. This will be fantastic for his stream.

[PS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n3pFFPSlW4)I feel that Byron is a fairly genuine guy. He has his sketchy moments tho especially when it comes to his ego. He also seems to pickup false micro agression sometimes which puts him into a slight defensive mode. I know he has been dealing with depression for quite a long time now which I have little opinion on simply because I have so little understanding of what depression is like for somebody in his position. Although it would appear to me that he is lacking a sence of purpose which Twitch does not fill. Dispite it all I still always enjoy watching him when he is in a glowing mood.This was really good insight on how Destiny can drive really good conversations with other individuals.

You should really pursue a podcast, especially with Reckful. Nice memesGuests: Destiny/Fed/Scarra (maybe Lily)I miss it lmao, it was a part of destiny that everyone could relate to, even tho it was ball busting, idk, lmao [In light of recent IMC memes where he accused an Iraq vet of stolen valor without any proof whatsoever](https://twitter.com/mistermegative/status/1007628609979342849), I have a few things to say about Ian Miles Ching Cheong:

This man was formerly anti-GG. He was working for Gameranx and [has written tons of anti-GG articles for Gameranx](http://thisisvideogames.com/gamergatewiki/index.php/Ian_Miles_Cheong#GamerGate). He got easy cash for being anti-GG and he did not receive any physical threats from GGers because he was living in Malaysia during the whole shit.

However, in 2015 Louise Mench gave him a blowjob and tonnes of money if he started working for her website Heat Street, a prominent Center-Right publication. [One of his first articles is getting triggered by a low-hanging fruit article about lack of PoCs in Witcher 3](https://theralphretort.com/reprint-of-ian-miles-cheong-full-apology-5027015/). Ever since then, he went downhill from there.

What does this mean? It means that Ian Miles Cheong would spout any political opinion if offered the money to do so. Remember, [he was shitting on Milo Yiannopoulos](https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/512216815926145024) during his Gameranx era and now both of them are fuckbuddies since [Ian now works for Milo's Dangerous blog](https://www.reddit.com/r/GGFreeForAll/comments/7lbeh5/ian_miles_cheong_blogs_for_milo_in_a_category/).

And this guy is willing to say retarded shit if he gets paid for it. Why do you think that he has the balls to spout misinformation about LA politics during the 6 hour cancer stream against Destiny? Because he's paid to do that shit.

If a left-wing publication like Polygon gave him more money than Milo, then he might change his tune. But that only reveals his shilling even further, and that he has no actual opinions on any matter whatsoever unless paid to do so.

Also, remember how I told you that he lives in Malaysia? [Check out his Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stillgray/). There's not a single photo proving that he lives in the US. All of his photos are pretty much taken in Malaysia. [This photo from January](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bd7nDZsjxLk/?taken-by=stillgray) was taken in [Little Elephant](https://www.facebook.com/Little-Elephant-1531625983827736/), a restaurant in Ipoh, a city in Malaysia.

I also digged a bit further and found this meme: [A man by the name of Ian Miles Cheong Wen Xian registered an offshore entity in Ipoh](https://panama.data2www.com/o/91760), the same city Ian took the photos at. And apparently the company has been existing up till the Panama Papers in 2016. [There's even an RPG Codex thread confirming that Ian's Chinese name is "Wen Xian"](http://www.rpgcodex.net/forums/index.php?threads/best-thread-ever-no-sjw-related-posts-allowed.57009/page-216).

I cannot find a single proof that he was living in The US. [The closest was that he was running a shell company in The British Virgin Islands with the registered address in Ipoh](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/91760). But anyone can do that, and anyone can open a shell firm in a tax haven without even going there (via a third party, especially).

So yeah, tl;dr Ant Ching Chong is a shill, he doesn't live in The US and he lives and works in Malaysia. People should stop engaging with a literal shill who doesn't have an opinion of his own.Destiny sounds like a stripper name. That is why I purpose he changes his name to [Despacito](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n3pFFPSlW4) 

It's young, it fresh, and it can get a new generation of people to watch the stream. The only difference I find between the current stream and Destiny making a regular podcast, is that the regular podcast would need some planning and scheduling beforehand. He would have to prepare ideas and quests for the podcast, but he "already does that" whenever he talks about a topic or someone contacts him to talk about anything.

Whenever someone says that Destiny should make a podcast, he is just telling Destiny to work harder on what he is doing, making it a regular thing with planned topics and quests, but that is a hassle that he can avoid with the way he is doing it now.

tldr: Destiny already has an organic and informal podcast. If we ask him to make a podcast, we are just asking him to work harder.It was kinda bizarre considering how much Pokimane &amp; Destiny/Reckful's content differs from each other but she actually bounced off of them really well and seemed to be a great representative of the middle-ground of Twitch and was able to push Destiny's buttons really well during his stories while keeping the conversation flowing

Overall, A+ content from Poki (and sorry Fed but I can't include someone whose mic was muted LUL).He's a super entertaining guy and the two have interesting conversations. Based off the podcast, he clearly thinks pretty highly of Destiny so the windows open. Podcasts, Japan trip, talking to him about philosophical questions over discord, just playing games and shooting the shit, whatever form it comes in I just want to see more of these two together.Destiny stated that he wouldn't like it if his partner kept loving him even if he was being an asshole to them. In other words, showing the opposite of what they loved him for. According to destiny, it meant that they didn't love him in the first place.

I just wanna say that this is a really harmful and toxic way of looking at relationships. The reason that they love you at your "lows" is because they believe that the real you, who they fell in love with initially, is still there and they are trying their best to bring him back. This applies to pretty much any relationship. There will always be ups and downs unless one side goes to the extremes (becomes abusive, etc..).Destiny said that most people don't agree with maximizing their own happiness and rather come from a place like maximizing happiness for all sentient creatures. While I agree that most people don't want bad for other sentient creatures, I don't think it's their main goal. Rather, I think that everyone has the goal of maximizing their happiness. And that is, because seeing other animals (mainly mammals) similar to humans suffer will make them feel bad. And that goes against the goal of being happy.

I think we are all "selfish", looking to maximize our happiness from the day we were born. Be it a religious person believing in the endless happiness of afterlife or someone caring for others, because they are a source for happiness.&gt;I know they’ve discussed a little bit around YouTube and it’s their career and all, but I feel like it would be nice if they at least researched trendy topics and got their opinions out about it. Like with all due respect, be a streamer ... but why put a podcast out on SoundCloud and other areas if half of it was Destiny being mean to Lily? 

&gt;Then again I’m biased I really dislike Destiny, he’a an arrogant asshole, thinks highly of himself and has some very twisted views. He also for some reason... always tries to mention that’s he has high IQ yet only gets to plat in league?            ,

"Oh hullo me ol' chum"bring up topics of interest regarding destiny turning into a breathing Lords Mobile add here.

One thing I thought was interesting is how Destiny experienced all the things he's told us that he fears most in life in a package:

Loss of control (ego death, no way to get out)

Loss of objectivity (in general)

Loss of reality (gaslighting)

Loss of accomplishments ("my whole life, me being a father, me having a career, it was all a lie")

"Death" - Steven is convinced that he experienced "death", which is contradictory since he's claimed that death is most likely nothingness, which can't be experienced. This probably means that his mind snapped up his worst experience and convinced him that it was "death". This can also mean that Steven has always subconsciously imagined death to be an eternity of something. This would make sense since the only way the brain can imagine something is to imagine experiencing it. Since eternal nothing is death (according to what Steven considers most logical) and eternal nothing can't be imagined, he has to put a placeholder in, which is eternal something.

This is the jackpot of all of Destiny's fears. 

I never thought he'd go out of his way to have a psychedelic experience of any kind. Sorry that it was a bad trip, but it sounds like he doesn't regret doing it now that he's on the other side of it. If he ever tries anything like this again, I hope it's DMT. Just wanted to share how happy I am that Destiny stepped out of his comfort zone to experience something I think everyone should at least once in their life. During the podcast, Reckful brings up a point where a person buys a stock at a lower price, the stock goes up, but the person wouldn't buy any more stock at that new price. Howerver, they don't sell either. Reckful approaches it from a theoretical standpoint whereas Destiny approaches it from more of a personal one. [Timestamp link to the discussion](https://youtu.be/lRckX2H8NEI?t=2h3m14s).

I'd like to introduce you to the endowment effect, a behavioral economics perspective that attempts to provide an answer. The endowment effect, see [Thaler 1980 for the most comprehensive overview](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167268180900517), argues that possession of an item skews the perspective of our willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA). This is seen throughout a number of examples. [Knetsch 1989](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1831454?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) used a simple example of a mugs versus candy, where random initial assortment with free trading lead to wildly different outcomes than free choice from the start despite no trading costs. Another example comes from [Tversky and Kahneman 1981](https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/suz/dam/jcr:ffffffff-fad3-547b-ffff-ffffe54d58af/10.18_kahneman_tversky_81.pdf) (who also describe prospect theory which I can discuss in another post possibly), where the focus of the study was more on framing, but the framing of ownership in one particular example (Problem 8 and 9 in the linked article, although if you only read 1 behavioral econ paper in your life it should be the entirety of that paper) highlighted that ownership of a ticket lost versus losing that exact amount on the way to buy a ticket shifted an astounding 42% of people's decisions.

In short, ownership of an item shifts our WTP and WTA significantly. Countless studies have repeated this in higher stakes games as well, though I link 3 of the foundational studies for you now. I'm really impressed Reckful brought up the concept without having learned of it officially. The guys mostly assumed it was through risk and having too much stake (which is likely true for them and a part of it), but a large part of the answer is actually that ownership skews ones value of an item, which means that while he may not want to buy any more twitter stock at the new price (WTP), he also values his own share too high to sell it at that (WTA).

Edit: Reckful also hints at loss aversion a fair amount, though I think it's more likely he's aware of that theory given his interest in stocks.I was watching a video on the trending page: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWoHcSTqiy4

I was really curious about what would happen in the comments section. And I am honestly not surprised. Just a bunch of racism. These racist comments are liked by so many people, its sad really. 

Some of the comments:

- Which zoo did this take place at?﻿ (to be fair, they could just be referring to their weight)
- Ashamed of my own race. Then they wanna say we being oppressed but wanna go act the fool.﻿
- And these same individuals probably complain about being racially profiled lol...﻿
- 'Dey never axed us to pay."﻿
- Black privilege?﻿
- They probably didn't know you cant pay with food stamps.﻿
- Sounds about black﻿
- Not even surprised, I knew it was black people before even clicking on the video!﻿
- Third world people﻿
- Bunch of dindu nuffins﻿
- fuckin nigga trash﻿
- It’s time to play:GUESS THE MINORITY!!!!﻿
- Could you expect anything less from these kinds of people. When everything is handed free to them. Typical Black's.﻿
- same kind of ppl who hate being stereotyped, I bet﻿
- That's why there's no nice restaurants in black communities﻿
- Why shoulds dey have ta pay? Dat raciss.﻿
-of course they’re all black lol﻿


Idk what the point of this post is. I guess I am just pissed off about how this amount of racism is becoming more and more common. I may be wrong, but I personally am seeing a lot more racism in comment sections of youtube videos (again, I may be wrong).



On the podcast https://clips.twitch.tv/IgnorantPuzzledRuffCclamChamp they were talking about twitch bans and Pokimane thinks its gotten better. https://youtu.be/-smYruG0GNQ?t=2958 I feel that Pokimane should of been banned for this comment when compared to Destiny https://clips.twitch.tv/CrispySavoryMonkeyYeeI found destiny after watching the Reckful and Poki podcast and was really drawn in by his talking.  

So, after watching like 100 top clips on destiny’s channel and looking at the sub, all I can wonder is...what the fuck is up with the gnomes? 

Can someone give me a brief history of this “thing” with gnomes. 

Edit: on mobile btw, can’t see the sidebar, don’t know if it’s there or something. gnome is destiny's 11+4I have been watching Destiny now for about 6 months, and its made me rethink a few things in regards to where I get my news from in general. I have been very interested in politics over the past 4 years and I lean progressive/left. For curiosity's sake, would you all mind doing the poll below?  Ill try to include as many options as possible, and **you can select multiple answers** to help us see which sources are the most relevant to this sub in general.

Feel free to discuss below about specific sources too if you feel they are more (or less reliable and why). Thank you!

[Where do you get your news from?](https://www.strawpoll.me/15917280)I remember him saying a long time ago that he valued his mind the way it is, and therefore doesn't ever want to use drugs that alter his mental state or something like that. I'm watching his latest VOD on Twitch right now and I'm very curious when he changed his mind on this topic. Does anyone have a clip? Either way, I'm happy that he opened his mind and had an interesting experienceThe following is a post I made a few months back. It was live for an hour or so before Destiny deleted it (possibly a request from BadBunny). I didn't think people cared that much so I moved on, but judging from the reception and concern from the [recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/8rk443/badbunny_with_the_hot_take_on_whether_or_not_the) about her, I thought this needed to be brought up again:

I'm sure I'm not the only one who's been watching BadBunny lately, especially now that Destiny's political stuff has stagnated. While I think her streams can serve as both decent entertainment and even a substitute for Destiny sometimes, I also think we need to acknowledge a serious ongoing problem with the way she interacts with her audience.

In almost every stream or hers, there are multiple moments where she will spend a significant amount of time honing in on a single viewer, antagonizing them. This can be anything from snide remarks or mischaracterization, to outright personal insults and mockery. She justifies her attacks by claiming she's just making fun of idiots, but I think this justification is very poor in her case, whether or not the person actually is an idiot. I think there is a place for calling people out for what they say, but the way she dedicates entire sections trying to make them look bad, the way she seems to work hard to take the worst possible interpretation of everything they say, the extent to which she speaks as if she has absolute knowledge of their intentions and beliefs to the point where Destiny almost looks like JF in comparison, makes me think this is miles beyond just "calling out idiots". When her attacks are questioned, it seems as if she almost becomes upset that her audience isn't just trusting her "authority" on the matter, which is very troubling. All this, in combination with her admitting she feels good about putting people in their place, admitting her goal in debates is almost always to ridicule people... this all seems to be nothing less than outright bullying.

After seeing her consistently act like this, I can't with good conscience say that BadBunny is a good person in any sense of the word. From this moment on, I will stop attending her streams and cancel my subscription until she chooses to accept the responsibilities she has as a content creator.

BadBunny, if you by chance happen to ever read this, then I encourage you to think long and hard on whether the effects you're having on people are worth your feelings of vindication; whether it's worth it for the 'content'. Keep in mind, what you're doing affects both the people you're targeting directly, psychologically (many of which who are (were?) looking up to you), but is also a driving force in the kind of community you're fostering. As for the rest of us, I think we need to extend support to the people she has targeted, to let them know that destiny.gg welcomes them with open arms, because we're not bullies here.One of the reasons people say Destiny did not went too hard on Boogie was that [he's scared that he might risk destroying him emotionally considering him mentioning he's felt suicidal](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/8twwfu/boogie_will_debate_destiny/e1blcke/)

But isn't that Boogie's own fault? [One of the most oft-quoted words by politicians was that politics is not the faint-hearted](https://www.facebook.com/MrKRudd/videos/10155600160597269/). I mean, when even a former Australian Prime Minister said so, it just means that Boogie shouldn't have entered political discussion in the first place.

I mean, it's also a reason why my favourite gaming and film Youtubers don't dabble in politics unless if it's in a gaming or filmmaking context. They're not smart enough for it and they know it. It seems that Boogie himself missed the memo.So I just heard (in a vod) Destiny and co talk about multivitamins being useless. I've never heard of this before and am curious, so I've done a little research.

I haven't seen too much convincing research about how multis are not beneficial. It seems that the consensus is that taking multis are a very low risk-low cost habit, and that there is little or no evidence pointing to any benefits or any harms.  
Is this accurate or does anyone disagree?

Devon is very interesting to me. He's really into health &amp; fitness but is kind of messy when it comes to following scientific literature vs speculation. Like when he talked about trying out different B vitamins and isolating their impact on his body over the course of months, and inviting people to advertise a certain product with promises of boosting cognitive functions.  
I'm a little confused because when Destiny mentioned Soylent, Devon talked about two alternatives which basically just sounded like a better version of green powder to me. But does either of those have any positive effects on your health? If it's a meal replacement, sure, do your thing. But if it's just a supplement with a similar purpose to a multi, is it even worth it?  
Isn't zinc and magnesium beneficial for lifters? Why would a multi be worse for this than supplement alternatives?

&amp;nbsp;

Currently, I take 4 supplements: a multivitamin, fish oil, glucosamine chondroitin, and creatine (and protein powder but that's besides the point here).  

I appreciate any honest input.I guess money is the root of all evil.

Like how can you change all of your political positions for monetary gain and get continually get exposed for not knowing anything. Idk how you even let it get this far and still look yourself in the mirror?Did he realize something that made him uncomfortable? [](/HmmStiny)[I've made a guide for content creators who got banned on mediums like Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Twitch and more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJQP7kiw5Fk). I hope Destiny appreciates this guide and hoped to see my method work in getting him back on Twitch.quick someone rush and feed him his autist pllsNot just assault rifles, but also shotguns and handguns and all other forms of gun from civilian use, with firearms license only approved for police and security personnel. Like, do these people know how good it feels like to be able to go outside anywhere and anyplace knowing that chances of getting shot by firearms is close to zero? **Previously on reddit**

[](/Abathur)Whenever I hear memers like Richard B. Spencer and /u/ReactionaryCatholic (RIP) advocate for "Peaceful Ethnic Cleansing", it always harkens back to my visits to Cambodia. 

I lived in Cambodia as a kid during the UNTAC days (my dad was a UN policeman and my mom was a French translator there) and a few years later as a teenager I went back to Cambodia and visited demined villages, The Killing Fields and even Tuol Sleng and looking back at it today, I came to the conclusion that Pol Pot was pretty much the closest the world has ever gotten to a "Peaceful Ethnic Cleansing".

Pol Pot wanted to create a small agrarian communist society with the population of the old Angkor Empire. Therefore he wanted to cleanse 3/4th of the total population. He forced them all out of the cities and into the farms, work them like slaves, give them shitty food so that they could starve to death and eventually die. They also killed doctors and nurses so that none of them will receive proper healthcare and that they will die from even the slightest cold. That's why the many victims of killing fields are mainly from starvation and disease, whereas gunshots and executions are reserved for the "intellectual class" (aka government workers, medical workers, French speakers, professors, teachers, etc.) It is the closest there is to a "peaceful ethnic cleansing" meme envisioned by the Alt-Right.

However, Pol Pot fucked up. When he tried to peacefully cleanse the Vietnamese border population, he pretty much pissed off Vietnam and Vietnam invaded Cambodia in retaliation. However, by peacefully cleansing 3 million people he pretty much cleansed 90% of future conscripts and thus, the Khmer Rouge were overwhelmed by a huge, healthy Vietnamese military. Also, the Khmer Rouge also executed sailors and fighter pilots when they took over, creating an almost non-existent Air Force and Navy for the Khmer Rouge. So yeah, a "Peaceful Ethnic Cleansing" literally destroyed the same regime that started it.

So yeah, /u/NeoDestiny should really ask these race realists about the Khmer Rouge whenever a race realist memer talks "Peaceful Ethnic Cleansing". Seriously, the fact that these people would enact a policy that was literally considered a historical failure is mind-blowing.Do these pro-gun idiots realize that banning guns means it would be significantly much harder for a criminal to acquire a gun, legal or otherwise? I assume the vast majority of 'iilegally owned' guns used in crimes in the US are acquired from legal means; i.e stolen legal gun, or bought or given a legal gun by someone else, etc. Like, you always hear people like Sargon or Blaire White or ShoeOnHead or Dave Rubin putting on kid gloves when discussing conservative issues if not soft-agreeing with them, yet you never see people like Steven Crowder or Ben Shapiro or Lauren Southern or Gavin McInnes even agreeing to any left-wing stances. It's almost like this 'mutual conversation' between 'both sides' only goes one way. In fact these people shit on left-wing politics all the time and they don't get called out, yet we still can't even get ArmouredSkeptic to say even a word about Trump.Like, if you exchange birth control pills with any other pill, like Paracetamol (because god knows more people get headaches than unexpected pregnancies) I'm pretty sure conservatives wouldn't give a damn shit about it. It's almost as if women having more control of their sex lives is a big deal for these people.[...meanwhile an increasing number of the world's most successful billionaires are endorsing socialist values like universal basic income.](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/richard-branson-interview-on-the-nordics-ikea-and-obama-v2-2017-10?r=US&amp;IR=T)slurp slurp slurpSo this guy thinks that SJWs are a bigger threat to humanity than Obamacare repeal but when pressed to give any proof he resorts to sob stories and accusing the chat log for making fun of his stutter instead of giving any proof. 

He also thinks that an MTV webhost and Quasimodo with 47K subs have more control over modern society than the current President of the United States.

It makes me angry how these people who are able to make boogeymen out of nobodies can get 200K subs and help influence people like JonTron, Fantano and H3h3. This is not normal.It's fucking irritating that the state of the game nowadays is picking between Christian conservative libertarians whose ideas and values I don't agree with, and libshits who want to label every rock, tree, and grass that look at them funny as white supremacists.Sometimes I wish he could live in an actual Muslim society surrounded by actual Muslims and know their actual opinions. If Steven thinks the Skepto-sphere^TM are a bunch of racist bigots, wait till he hears what the average Muslim thinks about minorities and race relations, not to mention ~~terrorists~~ mujahedeen.Maybe the people who are advocating for voter ID laws have racist intentions, but there's nothing wrong with wanting at least some form of official identification for someone to vote. In fact it's pretty reasonable thing to demand; other countries have voter ID laws. My country has voter ID laws. I've never once in my life heard anyone arguing that requiring people to have ID to vote is considered racist, and my country is even more racially charged. 

If you don't like the fact that less blacks vote because less of them have official IDs, then encourage them to get one. From what I heard it's not even that expensive. Where I come we all have mircochipped Identification Cards (IC) that we carry around. We even know our social security numbers by heart. And my country is some poor backwards third world country. I'm sure Americans can do better.https://youtu.be/nQN1_1Jv4LQ?t=7380

Does Destiny serious think that getting HIV is just the same as getting Herpes? One is just common virus that 90% of sexually active adults in the US have, causes minor negative health symptoms, and does not cause major life altering consequences, while the other is fucking HIV.**Previously on reddit**

[](/Abathur)[In light of todays video about where your hand should be on the keyboard,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CthtqOdBd0g) I would like to ask: What keys does /u/NeoDestiny use to "tab" (check scoreboard), level up skills and so on. Did he bind everything to mouse buttons so he can glue his left hand to QWER?

I was under the impression that Q+W+E/R was better in every single situation except fast key combinations including your ultimate, but if you value the quick E+R combos you play with four fingers on those buttons.I see with Jontron, the Vaping Trump supporter from Canada and the recent debate video posted by Garyukov. Like, they all want to reduce immigration and bring back jobs to America but when Destiny asks about the economic implications they all went "Well, globalization is evil and people don't need new iPhones" as if they're hippie protesters at the WTO Summit.

Like, what's up with that? Even more ironic is Jontron's [recent praise for the iPhone 8](https://i.imgur.com/edqSaiR.png), a mobile experience that can only exist through a globalised society.He reminds me of no bullshit and I'm wondering if it's literally the same person.Everytime I see some fucking moron from the left and the right talk about "Islamic Reformation", it drives my head up the fucking wall. They think that somehow all Muslims need to reinterpret the Quran and The Hadith to form a liberal modern day lifestyle that fits with modern democracy and human rights. Sure, that's a great idea but where's the economics of it?

Hell, every call for "Islamic Reformation" has led to disaster. The only people who picked up the call for reformation are crazy radical fuckers. Sayyid Qutb, Muhammad Iqbal, Ali Shariati. These were the guys who answered the call of "reformation". And you know what happened? Al-Qaeda, The Iranian Revolution and The First Kashmir War happes. While many Muslims in those days were too busy with their lives, the ones with free time in Western universities picked up the call for reformation in The Muslim world, used the funding and knowledge of the West to spread dangerous Islamist ideas to their home countries and the result is a clusterfuck that spread the fires of Sykes-Picot. 

Hell, this is no different from other religions. [Martin Luther was a huge anti-semite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Jews_and_Their_Lies) and his work was used to spread Anti-Semitism for the next 400 years. It is known that crazy radical motherfuckers are the ones who ALWAYS picks up the call for reformation whenever some snooty elite piece of shit who has never lived in a repressive society asks "[Insert religion here] needs a reformation".

The reality though is that it's the economy, stupid. Things like the Arab Spring were started by a middle class economy like Tunisia getting affected by the 2008 recession. The Tunisians want economic reform, not religious reform. They want a new government that can maintain and grow its middle class economy, and they got it. That spread to other Arab countries that wants a middle class economy similar to that of Tunisia. However, people like Assad and Gaddafi refused to give them what they want and the result is rebellion.

And the West responded as if they're bringing democracy, not a middle class economy. That's where the problems start.

The Muslim world doesn't give a fuck about democracy. Democracy doesn't have an economic system attached to it. Unlike democracy, Islamism has its own economic system that favours a mixed economy based under Sharia. Plus, Sharia has a Zakat system that offers handouts and loans to poor business owners. That's why people cling to Sharia instead of modern political systems: They favour a system that favours poor and middle class people economically over a system like democracy that doesn't have an economic system piggybacked on to it.

Hell, Iraq is a textbook example for this. After America invaded Iraq, [they forbade Baathis from having any job whatsoever](http://fpif.org/just-much-paul-bremer-blamed-rise-islamic-state/), and instead try to push for an election in 2005. This is a fucking huge mistake as Iraqis wanted jobs, not elections. They don't see voting for a representative as a top priority. They wanted to rebuild their lives after a horrendous war, and they can't because the US forbade them from getting paid a salary. And from there on, a new conflict started which led to ISIS.

Why don't these fuckers ever learn that it's the economy stupid? 

Hell, [Iran fucking loves South Korea](http://www.koreadailyus.com/imagining-the-korean-waves-future-in-iran/). And South Korea is a conservative democracy with a HUGE middle class, which is a perfect model for the Middle East to emulate. So why not try and use Iran's love of Korea to emulate the Korean economic miracle in Iran instead of isolating them? Let them have their conservative society but at the same time, help them build a middle class that can lead to a proper democracy, [which is exactly what happened in South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Struggle). Why don't these fuckers ever learn? Fuck Islamic reformation, The Muslim World needs an Economic Reformation.r they fuckin or wat**Previously on reddit**

[](/Abathur)I've been following JF ever since he first started to interact with Destiny, and I find him to be entertaining, thought provoking, and a great source of knowledge.

Though there is something that holds him back. When speaking publically on the internet, JF's brain consist of two main modes: JF the scientist, and JF the libertarian. JF the scientist cares only for the truth, and is driven by his curiosity about the world, while JF the libertarian has a way he would like the world to be, and strives to make his case for why it should be so. Optimally, JF is clear about which mode he is in, and he makes it easy for you to conclude whether he is in truth mode, or in value mode.

This is not always the case, and lately it's been harder and harder to determine. Whenever he defends/attacks arguments from the left or the right, JF the scientist and JF the libertarian tend to become intermixed into a toxic relationship, where the latter takes the former captive, and forces him into intellectual dishonesty to further his agenda, warping facts into ones that further his values. Examples of this is being extremely charitable towards arguments he agrees with, and vice versa with arguments he disagrees with, playing semantics games to make the truth appear a certain way instead of properly clarifying all the nuances of the words and potential intentions involved; basically stretching and corrupting the truth wherever he can, doing everything to present it in a certain way, instead of making his best effort presenting it as it is. Keep in mind this doesn't pertain to any statements that rest on value axioms (e.g libertarianism is good), but most commonly factual statements relating to people/groups of people who hold these values.

A defense JF makes against these sort of allegations is that he uses the [presumption of innocence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence) when evaluating statements someone has made, and is therefore extra charitable towards the one one the defense. The problem with this is that he chooses who is on the defense, depending on how the case is presented to him. Consider two scenarios:

&gt;I present a case to JF where Mike the SJW libcuck has accused Bob the Libertarian of lying, when this is not the case.

JF extends the presumption of innocence to Bob and is extra charitable towards him. All well and good. However...

&gt;I present a case to JF where Bob the Libertarian has accused Mike the SJW libcuck of lying, when this is not the case.

What happens here is something interesting. Now JF will extend the presumption of innocence to Bob again, because I have made the accusation that Bob has accused Mike of lying, making Bob the defendant of my claim. [Example of this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/jfg/comments/6guep0/jf_should_analyze_some_of_the_claims_sargon_has/)

In short, whenever JF is involved in politics, the JF that cared for truth first is completely subdued. It is only when JF does not engage in politics, that JF the scientist is free from the influence of his other self. 

I beg of you, /u/JFGariepy, look deep inside yourself, and help JF the scientist be free of the toxic influence of your other self. Where is the JF that wanted to teach epistemology? Where is the JF that defended Anita the same way he defended Sargon? I want that JF to come back, slap JF the libertarian in the face, and keep the search for true knowledge pure. [](/MLADY)Gokustiny's move sets against Nick J. Frieza has improved alot since Xenomericaverse. His fight against Celltokur still needs a lot of bug improvements because it seems to be the same as the last fight. Majin Buushit 19 is still useless as before which is expected.

KrillinPoints and Therynshinhan departing from the match was a bummer. They could've landed some great hits.

Android Southern 18 is still perfect waifu, but this Android Millenial 21 is looking pretty good too. Can't wait for the Rule 34.

Overall, I'm happy that DebateBall Fighter Z is looking good so far. I hope they re-release the Jon Vegetron DLC, Piccolo of Akkad DLC and the rumored Ian Miles Shenron DLC. Also, some ally DLCs like Trunksy King and  HYamchaGuy too.I'm curious how he responded. Most large twitch streamers get over the top whenever they get large donations, but I don't see Destiny doing that. He is a pretty articulate guy and knows how to defend his position, yet at the age of (idk) 18-23 yrs old he is a complete whack job, incredibly scientifically illiterate and heavily religious. Which is a shame because he doesn't seem as bafflingly retarded as someone like NoBS, he can actually reason and think, but it is completley misdirectedPeople like Nick Fuentes talking about bringing society to it's 'natural order', bringing Christianity back from hundreds of years ago and propping it up as the pillar of government, about returning women to their traditional roles, and sending LGBT people to 'doctors' and 'shock therapy', these are no different than what the average Muslim believes in.

You talk to Muslims in Indonesia or Pakistan or Egypt and these are the same ideas that they hold; they also want to make Islam and sharia as the pillar of government, they also want bring back Islam from the supposedly glorious Islamic Golden Age, they also want to discriminate against they LGBT people.What's the song that goes like:

&gt;BWANANANANA

&gt;BWANANANANANANA

&gt;dodododododid they both broadcast the debate? and is it possible to have both cams on at the same time? otherwise ill wait a bit for destiny to publish the debate on youtubeDestiny seems to assume that he won this debate pretty handily. However, if his goal was to change the mind of undecided viewers I think he did worse then he usually does.

1)Hitting philosophical bedrock

I think Destiny is pretty good at showing when someone uses a leap of logic or lack of evidence to come to their conclusion. But for someone like Nick who has a million studies and quotes(I mean he literally uses a fringe/liberal use of the term posterity to back ethno-nationalism) and a fairly logical thought progression, this tactic doesn't work. 

The question literally twenty minutes or so into the debate should have been "why should the values of people who have long since been dead shape what America should be today". Destiny attempted to ask this question, but Nick refused to give any substantive answer and it didn't really naturally follow from the previous points made; Destiny just pulled it out haphazardly. 

Also if Nick Fuentes attempts to do a word salad or virtue signal about "the original intent of the constitution and our founding fathers", Destiny needs a better way to pull these conversations back down to reality. Some people are better at this then others, and just being objective, I think Destiny is below average in this area. 

2) Ad hominems

I realize Nick started this, but literally throwing out ad-hominems/being dragged down to their level doesn't do you any favors. These people literally thrive on the feels vs. reels argument. I firmly believe that even if you make good points, in the eyes of most people who are undecided, if you use ad hominems excessively, you lost.

3) Race &amp; IQ

I don't know why Destiny is so hesitant to talk about this.It seems like he has done some reading on it, but in arguing with these people it seems illogical not to be pretty well-read. Most of their arguments, and entire worldview is predicated on the fact that skin color = muh genes. I mean they already imply it, if not outright say it. Nick literally said in the 5 v. 1, "mass immigration will create the same low IQ and the same despotism of the third world". Optically, talking around it doesn't do him any favors and is just fuel to their fire.

I don't think he did poorly. These are just some areas I think he could improve, I mean he is already talking to literal retards, but he can probably lay most of these people bare, like he did with Dick Masterson, with a little improvementtake it how you will, as i'm just another random dude on reddit, but i worked with /u/NeoDestiny and *he is the fucking worst*. just a greasy, unrepentantly gross manchild. i have several friends who've also worked with him, or p.a.'d on sets he's been the "star" of.

quick anecdote: ended up going for a ride with him on a film i was in (small role), because my friend - also a p.a. - had to drive him back to his house to find a shirt. we sat at his coffee table, covered in about 2409r782374 ash trays and seven boxes of half eaten mike &amp; ikes. what seems like an hour later of uncomfortable stillness he comes barreling out of his bedroom, a little sweaty, panting, and drops fuckin STACKS of vhs tapes on the table in front of us. we were both pretty confused at the point. he then pops one in his combo vhs/dvd player and it's him getting blown by some poor chick with really fuckin terrible roots, he then puts the shirt over his slovenly body, turns to my friend and says, "this good?"

it is one of the most surreal, ridiculous moments of my life.

[](/Abathur)to get a girl like lilypichuIs his dad's name Steven Bonnell too?Holy shit. Was he actually retarded? He was "discombobulated" for what felt like 10-15 minutes, and couldn't even make one argument. Jesus, that was so hard to watch, how does this guy live his life. Does he just have a bunch of anti-sjw buzzwords floating around in his head all day?

Wtf man, he’s funny.Okaystiny?The stream where destiny critiques houses for sales is one of my favorite to re-watch. It was super chill and entertaining, I'd love to see more of these types of streams/videos for both his Twitch and YouTube channel. I think it would really break up the monotony of a certain game. I've had this theory for a while:

The person we currently know as Steven Bonnell II is actually the evil doppleganger form a darker timeline who came to our universe, killed Destiny and took over his life.
His ultimate goal is to destroy christian values in the USA, so he fathered a child, Nathan, and is training him to become a leftie Antichrist.

This is why he's having trouble in long-term relationships - it's because it's difficult for him to care a for someone from outside of the dark timeline.
The only person for whom he shows consistent affection is his demonic spawn.

The cruel sense of humor on his stream and the insensitivity to abuse he displays on twitter is further evidence in support of this theory.

The undeniable smoking gun is of course the [Evil Goatee^TM](https://trekkerscrapbook.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mirrormirrorhd0370.jpg)Therefore all Christians including Donald Trump love gay people.https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/a-woman-approached-the-post-with-dramatic--and-false--tale-about-roy-moore-sje-appears-to-be-part-of-undercover-sting-operation/2017/11/27/0c2e335a-cfb6-11e7-9d3a-bcbe2af58c3a_story.html?

'Another reason O’Keefe’s plot collapsed again is because it is premised on a ludicrously false worldview. The Washington Post does *not*, in fact, publish unverified accusations just because they’re against Republicans. His various attempts to prove rampant voter fraud have failed in part because voter fraud is not rampant.
But this larger conceptual problem with O’Keefe’s enterprise creates a secondary problem, which is that the people who are dumb enough to believe these conspiracy theories are not generally smart enough to carry out a competent entrapment scheme'In fact, whether or not the universe is deterministic is completely irrelevant to the question whether or not free will exists; free will is just one of the many experiences of the human condition, it doesn't need the world to be deterministic for it to exist, just like how morality and emotions do not need the world to be deterministic for them to exist. We know them to exist because we as humans experience such. Free will is just a term us humans made up to refer to the sensation that we can make choices that effect the outcome of reality, as yes, we all definitely experience this sensation, thus free will exists.

Or look at it this way; imagine a leaf falling down from a tree. You could say that the world is deterministic and say the leaf was always meant to fall right from the start, you could also say that the world is not deterministic and the leaf fell from one of the many random posibilities that could have occurred. Yet no one would say the leaf has free will in either case, regardless whether the universe is deterministic or not, because the leaf is a non-sentient object incapable of perceiving the sensation of making choices.**Previously on reddit**

[](/Abathur)Destiny always makes the argument that caring for a dog and be disgusted that one is being hurt is hypocritical if you are a meat eater. The basis of this argument being that you're letting the emotions override the logic of the situation. Dogs are cute and man's best friend, so we tend to connect with them significantly more than cows or pigs. I would challenge destiny that there are situations when even he, the self proclaimed sociopath, would make decisions based solely on emotion. In a hypothetical scenario where Nathan and another boy are held at gun point and Destiny is forced to choose who dies. Assuming that he is informed both children would contribute exactly the same to society, that he would benefit from them both economically, and would even go so far as able to adopt the other boy to continue his lineage (I'm really grasping at straws for logical arguments here), destiny would almost certainly choose to save Nathan as it is his son. If I'm wrong, then destiny can correct me, but this seems like a situation where emotion is the sole deciding factor, no? I understand it is niche and obviously doesn't dismantle the larger argument he is making, however, I'm just curious if you guys think this would prove an inconsistency in his logic?He should try and have debates with people like Steven Crowder or Gavin McInnes or something. Ben Shapiro will be the final boss.From the latest 5v1 or whatever it was, Metokur was surprisingly fair and willing to discuss the topic at hand with Destiny without being rude and Destiny wasn't being a dick to him either. Destiny even said that he thinks Metokur was good in that discussion.

In particular I think it would be great if they revisited their discussion about immigration, clarified their viewpoints and that Destiny allows Metokur to ask as many questions about Destiny's view as possible, similar to how he tried to do in [this](https://youtu.be/-cgGjJpAb68?t=16710) discussion, but it was fucking ruined by the absolute mongrels, Ian and Tonka.

Metokur bought up valid questions about Destiny's argument and instead of Destiny sperging out, he remained calm and admitted when he couldn't answer a particular question (such as the long term impact of building up foreign economies to the point where they get to "first world" status.)

I can't be the only one who thinks this would be incredibly productive? Especially if it was somewhat similar to the Fuentes debate where they actual sort their shit out before hand.

bonus thing: imagine Destiny goes through the whole thing without coming off as a dick so that the opposing side literally has nothing to spaz about. Would be a wacky start to 2018.After giving it a second thought, I realized that this is important for the narrative of the new season. Dustiny needs to go into these rat nests, and wreck shit up. If not, you get another Walking Dead or GoT, and we DON’T want that. I want that fucking story arch where Destiny in a debate gets called a moral fag by Steven Chowder. Where the vocel Destiny finds love with internet girlfriend BadBunny, and then promptly realizes that it was a mistake, and goes vocel again. Where Mrmoot is corrupted by the ethnonationalist, and they have to debate on VRChat.

I know it may seem hard to understand right now, and especially shitty for the mods that are pissed right now, and I love yous for the work that you do. I hope you don’t totally give up on the direction the writers want to go this season. Also this may seem annoying to do again but if they act up like little shits, HIT ‘EM UP with the ban!I just started watching destiny's discussions not too long ago and  its like everyone he has a discussion with is completely incapable of thinking rationally or with even the slightest bit of logical consistency. https://youtu.be/lux8MlQd8yk?t=1903

The guy brings up a source about illegal immigration impact on wages, Destiny says that's irrelevant because it's about illegals and he's talking about legal immigration. He says that he's also opposed to illegal immigration, but when asked about he, he says he wants the illegals to be made legal immigrants. I assume this comes from the idea that if they were made legal, they wouldn't do things which result in lower wages such as getting jobs below min. wage?

So in what sense is he opposed to it? Or is he saying he would prefer if everyone who wants to come illegally would just do so legally but that we should also make the process much quicker, so as to match the illegal rate, or something along those lines?

Any videos where he specifically discusses illegal immigration and it's impacts or about his opposition to them would be interesting.**Previously on reddit**

[](/Abathur)Either a 4v4 debate or a 4v4 mud wrestling match my dudes.Destiny: "I don't wanna come and debate Richard Spencer because reasons"

Andy: "Kay sure brah imma just invite Sargon"

Destiny: "OMG WAT A CIRCLEJERK"Andy: Good morning guys, welcome to Warski Live, it's ya boi Andy here. We've got Illinois senator Abraham Lincoln on my left and on my left is my dude Jefferson Douglas. 

Douglas: Thank you Andy. My fellow opponent here went to work to abolitionize the Old Whig party all over the State, pretending that he was then as good a Whig as ever; and Trumbull went to work in his part of the State preaching Abolitionism in its milder and lighter form, and trying to abolitionize the Democratic party, and bring old Democrats handcuffed and bound hand and foot into the Abolition camp. At the time the Constitution was framed, there were thirteen States in the Union, twelve of which were slaveholding States and one free State. I believe that this new doctrine preached by Mr. Lincoln and his party will dissolve the Union if it succeeds. They are trying to array all the Northern States in one body against the South, to excite a sectional war between the free States and the slave States, in order that the one or the other may be driven to the wall.

Lincoln: Thank you to the honourable Mr. Warski. My fellow citizens, the first thing I see fit to notice, is the fact that Judge Douglas alleges, after running through the history of the old Democratic and the old Whig parties, that Judge Trumbull and myself made an arrangement in 1854, by which I was to have the place of Gen. Shields in the United States Senate, and Judge Trumbull was to have the place of Judge Douglas.

Now, about this story that Judge Douglas tells of Trumbull bargaining to sell out the old Democratic party, and Lincoln agreeing to sell out the old Whig party, I have the means of knowing about that; Judge Douglas cannot have; and I know there is no substance to it whatever.

Andy:While both of you made valid points,i think this is a fascinating discussion. it's always important to be exposed to new ideas, but i wanna read some super chats, I got Coon Killer 420 donating $20 and he said "Lincoln likes to see Mary get fucked by 20 negro slaves". Any response to that, Abe?

Lincoln: I will not have insults to my wife become an insult to my character. 

Andy: You got anything to say, Jeff?

Douglas: Yes, I do Mr. Warski. The first point to which I will call your attention is, as to what I said about the organization of the Republican party in 1854, and the platform that was formed on the 5th of October, of that year, and I will then put the question to Mr. Lincoln, whether or not, he approves of each article in that platform, and ask for a specific answer.

I did not charge him with being a member of the committee which reported that platform. The point I am going to remind Mr. Lincoln of is this: that after I had made my speech in 1854, during the fair, he gave me notice that he was going to reply to me the next day. I was sick at the time, but I staid over in Springfield to hear his reply and to reply to him. On that day this very Convention, the resolutions adopted by which I have read, was to meet in the Senate chamber. He spoke in the hall of the House; and when he got through his speech-my recollection is distinct, and I shall never forget it-Mr. Codding walked in as I took the stand to reply, and gave notice that the Republican State Convention would meet instantly in the Senate chamber, and called upon the Republicans to retire there and go into this very Convention, instead of remaining and listening to me. 

Andy: Hey man, that's a pretty cool response. We both been chilling out a lot, so I'm gonna bring in Jefferson to the chat so let's say hi to him, and we've also received $50 from one Nathan Bedford Forrest saying "ABE IS A NIGGER LOVER", but hey, I hope you dudes tone down the message a bit yo. Say hi to Jeff for us.

Lincoln: Good morning, Jeff.

Douglas: Good Morning to you, Mr. Davis. 

Jefferson: Good morning to all of you. Why do you love niggers, Abe?

Lincoln: I'm sorry?

Jefferson: I really mean it. Why do you want to free negro men and repeal The Fugitive Slave Act? Do you like fucking negro women? Does your wife like negro cock? Why are you so interested  in giving them freedom despite being 3/5ths of a person?

Lincoln: I'm pretty sure you've misconstrued my position on slavery. 
As to the first one, in regard to the Fugitive Slave law, I have never hesitated to say, and I do not now hesitate to say, that I think, under the Constitution of the United States, the people of the Southern States are entitled to a Congressional Fugitive Slave law.

In regard to the other questions,  I state to you very frankly that I would be exceedingly sorry ever to be put in a position of having to pass upon that questions. I will not respond to personal attacks against me, my wife or my character.

Andy: Hey man, that's cool for you three to participate in this really chillin debate here on Warski Live. Tune in tomorrow when I bring in Adolf Hitler, Otto Weiss and Ernst Thalmann for some chill shit. See you guys, tomorrow. Peace out!

If different races have different phenotypic differences and maturation differences,brought on by evolution, then why is there no difference in intelligence? This is a common argument race realist use, just worded slightly differently. I could not think of a response to this specific argument. 

Another brief but unrelated topic. Why do race realist care so much about intelligence if it is not very well defined. We know an intelligent person when we see them but you can't always correlate intelligence to someone's usefulness or productivity in society?

Can someone help a dude out here?So this is something I've seen with the N. Carolina ""debate"" about voter ID with Tonka, where Destiny first provided a NYT article which directly quotes the court documents about how it was systematically targeting black people etc. But for literally the whole debate till the very end, Tonka didn't believe the quote because it on NYT, even though it quoted the court and that you can click it to open the court document. (At this point, Andy, who also didn't believe Destiny's claim admitted that the quote was there and so changed his mind. Tonka on the other hand was just autistic and now just claimed it was an opinion and "da intent tho" even though he was clearly BTFO.)

Another example of this, is with Avilo and the intelligence communities joint thing about Russian meddling. He said it was fake news by CNN and that CNN was lying about what the intelligence communities said. When it was explained to him that the intelligence communities said this, not CNN, he changed this to an even more retarded stance that all the intelligence communities were controlled by the CIA who also control all the media to release propaganda about the Russians. (But his claim that the DNC purposely organised debates in bad times and rigged the primaries without any source was 100% true news.)

In both these cases, if the people understood that news, even this fake media, rely on an ounce of fact for their claims and that they can read the source to verify it. For example, instead of NYT, just give them the direct court documents or instead of saying it was reported by the intelligence communities, say they released a document, personally (fucking say it was on a special news website they run if you have to so they understand the idea that these groups do release their own stories too) to back up the claim because if it's from a news source, it's fake to these people. Doing this would clear up so much stuff because it stops wasting time debating about the news organisation and actually allows you to focus on the official documents which they are usually the ones to ask for (because they think they'll get you as they believe these documents don't exist.)He chose to not platform Spencer which in my opinion was a good call. That said, I believe most of the people he debates aren't particularly far off Spencer's ideology, and so I wonder what criteria Steven goes by. God help mePls say yesLiterally a victory in the Aliexpress of Central Thought ProcessesLike, just imagine that Destiny is talking to his lawyer after they’ve come to a deal of some amount of money from JF. Then Destiny turns and whispers into the ear of his lawyer

&gt;how much money do I get if I don’t have the non disclosure agreement?

Everyone is shocked and nobody understands why he’d turn down that fat stack of Whoopie Goldberg cashier checks (CAD), but we know. We know too well.

Beads of sweat start trickling down JF’s forehead. The judge is bamboozled. Destiny’s lawyer is almost there, but not fully. And then destiny turns his head to Mr.Mouton and looks right into the webcam duct taped to his forehead and says

&gt;yee boi

Kyle busts through the court room doors and takes shots with steven. Tigerlily leaves naniwa, admitting that having a baby with him was an elaborate attempt at playing hard to get. Erisann beats Mango. Aslan ascends to super nyanyan 3. The front page of every newspaper reads about the man who completely obliterated the alt-right.

Roll creditsINJUSTICE LEAGUE ARC INC.A very... VERY... dirty Jew. ;-)

EDIT: It's a sex joke, you virgins. Gah! NVM.Why do you think that sex with a 19-year-old is child molestation? Why is that relevant to JF's case? JF is an idiotic white supremacist, and the girl was mentally retarded, but why was her age even remotely relevant? The age of consent is 18 in California and 16 in Canada. Somehow 19 is a child to you? 19 isn't relevant to the case.Also imagine how ruined his career prospects are; from now on, if Andywarski wants to get a job in some other company or organization, the first thing his employers will see when they do a background check on him is his 'platform for the alt-right'....that baby would still have more superior white genes than most ethnostate race realists.Think about it, a week without Steven means more views and money for him it all adds up. He played poorly enough in League to bate Destiny into threatening him and his family. It's all very obvious. Nice try Mouts I'm on to you.I just got a 12 hour suspension from a tweet to Brittany and Ian from the 5 on 1 debate weeks ago cause I said they were retarded. It was reported under violent threats, anyone else get this? Seems like little fan boys are reporting accounts.https://youtu.be/Y7oQrDJ6gGo?t=1560

Simple question: how would you go about implementing this considering that the majority of people aren't for it.

JFs answer can be summed up as a few shitty crazy points:

* They don't want an ethnostate now, they're defending the idea so that it can be implemented in 50, 100 or a thousand years.

* He doesn't address how you would convince those who don't want to leave their country but says that they just wouldn't see the benefit of being American because a major economic crash could happen or a civil war (???), apparently these situations would make the situation want to segregate and get an ethnostate.

This is because he says he considers societies and cultures in terms of thousands to MILLIONS of years. What kind of fucking society has ever existed that long? Doesn't this seem like such a worthless position? He doesn't care for improving the present as much as the VERY distant future.

How can these people hold these positions without conflicting with their views on democracy? IDK, just hearing JF answer that made me really realise how worthless their argument is, it's literally crazy talk.is Steven and Badbunny fuckin or watThe question is how jealous will Lilypichu be once she finds outI understand, technically it was Tonka's show but clearly, Steven brought the viewers in, not that moron. Either way, I believe Steven has usually pretty well reasoned opinions on most things, but as for his stance to platform every idiot out there and beat them with arguments and reason, I'm not sure on that one. Steven keeps repeating his 40/40/20 rule where he believe only 20% of the viewers of his debates are actually swayable one way or the other but honestly, I'd have to see evidence of that because I don't believe that's based on any fact.

That said, I'm a big fan of what Steven generally does and he probably put a noticable dent in JonTron's career (or so I hope), but platforming morons like Tonka, Alt-Righters, Alt-Lighters and flat out Neo-Nazis is a double-edged sword at best, regardless of how well you did or how well you think you did in a debate. Exposing impressionable young people to hateful individual has its downsides, doesn't it?Just to see where her head is at? We all remember last girl with a animal in her name.Please don’t say it came from the marketplace of ideas or any variant thereof. I’ll donate to steven when he comes back on and say I’m going to kill myself and he’ll be banned for another week if anybody jokes around.**Previously on reddit**

[](/Abathur)Aren't governments products of the free market?He seems like a pretty decent guy. Also, Fable and Dungeon Keeper are some of my favorite games.Like idra.After having watched and listened to Destiny's ongoing feud with JF over race-realism, it reminded me of when Bill Nye debated Ken Ham over the theory of evolution. During the debate Ken Ham had a few Phd scientists argue against evolution via video clips of them. None were more triggering than this clip of Andrew Fabich, a PhD microbiologist. ( https://youtu.be/z6kgvhG3AkI?t=2701 )

Now it's clear that Andrew is biased by his religious views but notice when he talks about his publications that he doesn't mention any of his scientific work contradicts the theory of evolution. He merely states that he had many papers published to help establish his credibility, then goes on to say "yes X, happened but not because of evolution but due to proteins/genes turning on/off."
JF and his supporters will do the exact same thing. "of course JF knows more than Destiny, he's a PhD!" or "how many publications does Destiny have lol." Now here lies the crucial difference, While I disagree with Andrew Fabich's interpretation of evolution at least he is in an appropriate field to debate the subject (microbiology) whereas other people Ken Ham brought in where engineers and biometricists.
Now here is my main point, JF IS A FUCKING NEUROBIOLOGIST AND HAS NO MERIT IN GENETICS. However, there is no point in listening to some random Destiny fanboi; so, how about we go through some of JF's publications then?

1.)A Specific Population of Reticulospinal Neurons Controls the Termination of Locomotion 
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303782304_A_Specific_Population_of_Reticulospinal_Neurons_Controls_the_Termination_of_Locomotion

Goal of research: "Here, we took advantage of the lamprey model to characterize the activity of a cell population that we now show to be involved in stopping locomotion. We find that these neurons display a burst of spikes that coincides with the end of swimming activity."

Related to Genetics: NOPE

2.)Brain games: Toward a neuroecology of social behavior
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251877886_Brain_games_Toward_a_neuroecology_of_social_behavior

Goal: "We argue that a second-person neuroscience would beneﬁt from formal approaches borrowed from economics and behavioral ecology and that it should be extended to social interactions in nonhuman animals."

Related to Genetics: NOPE

3.)Neuronal reference frames for social decisions in primate frontal cortex
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233976528_Neuronal_reference_frames_for_social_decisions_in_primate_frontal_cortex

Goal: "We studied how neurons in three frontal cortical areas encode the outcomes of social decisions as monkeys performed a reward-allocation task." 

Related to Genetics: NOPE, studying neurons is not studying genes

4.) Specific neural substrate linking respiration to locomotion
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51870544_Specific_neural_substrate_linking_respiration_to_locomotion

Goal: "We investigated the neural substrates underlying the re-spiratory changes in relation to movement in lampreys. We showed that respiration increases following stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) in an in vitro isolated preparation, an effect that persists in the absence of the spinal cord and caudal brainstem"

Related to Genetics: NOPE 

5.) NEURO.TV: Neuroscience education on the internet
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262106330_NEUROTV_Neuroscience_education_on_the_internet

Goal: "NEURO.tv is a new educational project that seeks to bring advanced concepts in neuroscience to the general public. We film one-hour discussions with leading neuroscientists, philosophers, and psychologists who have had significant impact on our current understanding of brain function, and we publish these discussions on YouTube, iTunes, and other social media outlets"

Related to Genetics: LOL DOES THIS ONE EVEN COUNT AS A PUBLICATION?!?!

6.) Social learning in humans and other animals
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261883277_Social_learning_in_humans_and_other_animals

Goal: "Recent neurobiological studies have begun to uncover the neural basis of social learning. Here we review experimental evidence from the past few decades showing that social learning is a widespread set of skills present in multiple animal species."

Related to Genetics: FUCK NO, they briefly mention the word gene and epigenetics in the OLFACTORY CUES section but its insignificant especially since they are just reviewing data from the past and not doing any of their own.

There are 7 more publications done by JF that I didn't post since I couldn't easily find full-text versions but just by looking at the other titles(scientific titles are named in a way to easily understand what the paper is about) of his work I can safely assume that none deal with any sort of Genetic work. Here is a link to all of JF's work https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jean-Francois_Gariepy 

So, yeah.... I don't know how JF thinks his work in neuroscience gives him credence or knowledge in terms of genetics. No doubt he may have taken a class or had a course regarding to genetics but that is a far cry to having any sort of PhD-backing of his race-realist claims. Hell, after watching like 7 intro to behavioral biology with Destiny its plainly obvious that JF has no fucking idea what he's  talking about. I hope in the next debate with JF (if there is one) we can finally skewer this "intellectual powerhouse" that the alt-right/race realists hide behind.

TL;DR: In terms of genetics and race-realism JF's PhD TITLE IS WORTHLESS
Why doesn't he ditch his thick accent that makes him sound like a down-syndrome retard and go for a more Franglais-friendly accent?

[Here's Quebecois actress Charlotte LeBon speaking better accented English than JF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcOhpkFG4sA)

[Here's my dude Emmanuel Macron speaking better accented English than JF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe_MAYfj2AE)

Seriously though, JF's English AND French fucking triggers me. Il parle comme un jeune down syndrome parler Chiac.JP: One plus one equals two

Dumbass liberal: ONE PLUS ONE EQUALS TWO IS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT

JP: No it isnt

JP fans: OMG THAT MAN IS SO INTELLIGENT LETS WORSHIP HIMI just tuned in and it sure sounded like it. Did he elaborate on that? Any people he regrets platforming?Just a brief point I wanted to make about this debate topic.

Basically the idea is that social programs have created a market failure for wages, so effectively social programs end up subsidizing those industries.

I think the solution for this would be to tax companies according to the remedial social programs used by their employees.

I think this in principle is a perfect situation for taxation. Basically the idea is it's hard to find places that are actually good to tax, because every tax is a disincentive. Here is something that really should be disincentives, and could be a very lucrative tax.While the situation couldn't be more dire, just remember that you're currently living in a democracy (oligarchy, yes, but democratic institutions remain) and that it is important to vote, and in your fight for a better country and better world, that you be bold. Ever vigilant is the patriot of a democracy, for their liberty and equality are worthy of a robust defense. It's time to get out there and support not just progressive, non-SJW candidates but also other parties that are similar to or align alongside such views.

Even if there was the possibility of an event where, say, several liberal/progressive/socialist parties against one big conservative party, the next step would be to constantly keep their feet to the fire, to get the job done.

The moral of the story is simple: make sure Trump is a one-term president.The comprehension of infinity is the missing link to humans understanding existence...

So sometimes we all like to think about what is the meaning of life and the concept of existence...it is only natural. Today I was thinking about the concept in terms of the universe always existing...but it is obvious that humans are incapable of fathoming the concept that something has always existed and never had a starting point. You know that feeling in your head you get when you realllyyyyy try hard to think about space being infinite and as you try your hardest to comprehend it, you get that tickling feeling in the back of your head? That is just proof that we arent built to understand the concept of infinity. If we can't comprehend infinity, then we are unable to comprehend the universe and existence in its exactness.

Now, as I thought of this, I realized that we would have to be insane to think there isn't some sort of omnipotent driving force in the universe. The universe has been around forever, but reality is only present when there are organisms alive to experience it. Make sense? Ill let you think about that statement for a second...

Okay so if we can agree that if the concept of the universe being infinite and always having existed, then an omnipotent force isn't really so far fetched. Why is there a universe, what is forever? God these things hurt my brain even more when you realize time-flow is relative to where you are in the universe. Now to my point...lets say there is a god, but not a miracle worker. This god is a force that works with the tools the universe provides. We call those tools and restrictions, well, we call it science. This forces goal was to create reality. Stars and atoms bouncing around in space for infinity is pointless.

This god wanted to create a soul, or an existence that is aware of itself. So with the "Big Bang" a surface was created that could allow this process to start [earth]. First bacteria and organisms were created...this was good. This was the first step towards the creation of self awareness, reality and the "soul". Eventually animals known as dinosaurs became the pinnacle of evolution. But unfortunately these reptilian beings evolved in a way that met most of the criteria to start reality, but no soul. They could not become self aware. This did god no good. Now isnt it sorta convieneint that the earth supposedly randomly had a meteor hit it and hit the reset button? Only to have us humans, gods final form of existence to result from it? Mammals thrives after the ice age and led to gods patience being rewarded. Homo sapiens evolved and finally, a soul was created. The phenomenon of self awareness, paired with our curiosity and need for affection led to the creation of reality and the soul. Now this universe that has existed always and always will could be appreciated. But...the catch is that god had to give us some of his power in order for us to self actualize. That is where he lost control of us, when he lent us a bit of his power. The power to create through science. Now we are out of his control slightly, fighting wars and commiting crazy, evil acts[weopons, engineered bio weapons and nuclear bombs].

Also fuck MrMouton.I was watching an old vod and fell asleep. My housemate knocked on my door and tried to wake me up because we have a 9 am class together and when she came in she said all she could hear was “NONONONO” coming out of my laptop and me looking really out of it (I don’t wake up very well).

And I just wanted to say, fuck you Mr.Mouton. This is literally your fault you fucking shithead.https://youtu.be/SyKELbVv0jA?t=346

Why doesn't Destiny just explain what he means by data and explain better why watching videos doesn't mean shit?

Instead of just saying that the data he's seen is by groups of people who have looked at a range of videos, articles and sources to document left/right violence and that one person watching some videos on YouTube isn't as good of a form of data collection as that, he goes on about fucking confirmation bias.

That was a waste of time and should have only been bought up if they claimed they had an unbiased view when watching videos or something. Also, he should've made it clear that he understands that the videos show the events because to some of the more stupid people, it comes across as him saying that these videos are fake news or something.

Regarding the stuff about the president suing the media for libel, [this case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Co._v._Sullivan) may be of interest.

&gt;Before this decision, there were nearly US $300,000,000 in libel actions from the Southern states outstanding against news organizations, as part of a focused effort by Southern officials to use defamation lawsuits as a means of preventing critical coverage of civil rights issues in out-of-state publications. 

Basically, news orgs were sued in an attempt to limit what they cover. Other reasons why it would be difficult for someone like Trump to sue the media would because it would be very hard for a public official like that to prove actual malice and that what was reported was false. Examples given like the Buzzfeed article aren't things you could sue over because they were just reporting a document given to them by someone who they believed was credible. They also clarified some stuff about what they had reported in their article. I also don't think a president can sue for things like satire or just people talking shit about them, but I could be wrong about that.

Overall, I have to say I was quite disappointed, but not surprised by that debate.

BTW please never let the other person read their SUPA chats during the debate. If they do, start reading from your SUPA chats too pls.The way he talks about his childhood friend and his suicide, I think he would really appreciate Life is Strange.HsjfienfnelwofucinsjekfjtngbybyndkgkigigigkdksmwkwofigjrntnfndklwownfnfkcjfndjfudjrnfjekwkkfkfjskwlwowofigibtbtjdkfkekentbtnkfkgjrndnsmdmPre-"dox": 4.26%

Post-"dox": 4.22%THEY WERE RIGHT ALL ALONGI always prefer listening to Destiny debating people like Reactionary Catholic and BeerStormer because despite of their horrible views, they're VERY honest about their beliefs and thus, their honesty makes for an interesting conversation.

Hell, even Baked Alaska and Nick Fuentes debates are more enjoyable the Warski/Tonka debates because they're stupidly deadset on their beliefs instead of trying to play mental gymnastics.

People like Andy Warski and Tonka Soy are literally the most dishonest people on Youtube. They play around with Alt-Right beliefs for SUPA CHAT bux but will never honestly admit to it. Instead, they will rely on insults in order to shift the conversation.

Destiny should stay away from engaging anti-SJWs and instead should continue observing the infighting between the anti-SJW community, as people like Millenial Woes, JF and Andy Warski are trying to kick out famous anti-SJWs like Kraut, [Theryn Meyer](https://twitter.com/thetherynmeyer/status/950125468618862592?lang=en) and [Shoe0nhead](https://twitter.com/shoe0nhead/status/946398480968441857) for not supporting race realism and then trying to make people like Tonka Saw famous. Destiny should not dip his toes into the current anti-SJW infighting and should just either engage with the more honest and hardcore of the Alt-Right instead of cowardly anti-SJW fence sitters trying to eat each other.Figured we could use a break from all the Tonka bullying and alt-right memes. For me it was probably Dark Souls 3, watching him fight the cuck crab, or clip the gargoyles with that weird program he was paid to use, plus doing an autistic 10 Vit run first playthrough it was good times.Talking about the latest vid:


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTkMgMzYmQc&amp;t=129s


Apparently, that dude went full tough guy in the chat too and then felt so confident about his views as to expose himself to thousands of live and tens of thousands of VOD viewers.


The part in the latter half of the vid where Destiny asks "Why are you like this? Why do you have strong opinions on things you're not informed about?" (paraphrased) was the single most interesting part about the debate and I'm a little sad Steven didn't pursue that any further. I think it'd be **crucial** to understand how people develop adamant views on matters they know close to nothing about. Where did that Pepe-meme edge lord pick that shit up? Why did an undergrad student not question any of the information he was spoon-fed by /pol/, Sargon or whatever the fuck his sources were? Just how hard is it to assert that you're not equipped to talk about matter X at this point in time, that you'd need to do some research, and move on to another topic? Would that guy have offered his useless opinion on a quantum physics matter too if asked?


Just how the fuck has public discourse regressed to this?

Also one more thing as someone who was born in Germany: The guy was bullshitting about Syrians in subways begging for money. Those beggars have been here for as long as I remember and are generally Romani people. We are Chat, and we do not forgive. We are void of human restraints, such as having sex with our sisters. All those who break this pact will be eliminated without hesitation. Those who perform reckless actions or wish to harm Chat will be eliminated without hesitation. Failure is not tolerated. Enemies of Chat include anyone who is not a lib cuck. Our enemies are to be eliminated swiftly and without incident. Chat must work as one. No chatter knows everything. Betrayal of Chat is both impossible and unaccepted. Manipulation of the weak and innocent is a chatter's specialty. Once a victim is no longer commodious, they are to be reported. REPORT. REPORT. REPORT. No man-made or natural occurrence can harm Chat. Under no circumstances are Chatters human. We are above humans and mortality. Chatters are not to partake in meaningless tasks. Those who do are to be either reformed or eliminated. We are Chat, for we are many. A Chatter is everywhere at all times. All have the potential to be Chat until they choose not to. Chat has no weakness or flaw(except Bombjin) Laws of Nature and Man cannot restrain Chat. Chat is one. Feuding and argument amongst Chat is both impossible and unaccepted. Chat is in control at all times. Chat has no identity. Chat cannot be contained by mere restraints. Chatters are all equal(except Bombjin). No one is more or less important than Chat. Chat must obey the Bear. Those who do not are to be reformed or eliminated. Chat worships Destiny. Chat cares for nothing but Destiny. The Alt-Right is the virus; Chat is the cure. We are Chat, and we do not forgive.Kyle Kulinski is currently lives tweeting point by point of the policies he propose and how much of that is true. Enjoy, if you are into more policy related stuff instead of garbage drama.
https://twitter.com/KyleKulinski/status/958537978195992578As a new fans of Destiny since the Lauren Southern stream, I find it quite ridiculous with the recent stuff that he have been involve in. I guess it was entertaining for a while, but does not worth the amount of attention it got.
I think, it is time for Destiny to discuss about more intelligent topic with decent people. For example: Kyle Kulinski from secular talk (a personal favorite) about TPP/ trade deals in general.**Previously on reddit**

Questions about Facebook deleting or sharing data have been repeated multiple times but most allow him to answer with very face value responses.

[](/Abathur)sometimes i wonder if they would banter while fuckin just like in their streamsNever thought it would effect me, but it's not something I can stop thinking about. I feel like there is a growing hatred for people like me although I've done nothing wrong and try to be a good person in my country.

I'm an Iraqi, but born and raised in UK. I do great in school, never committed a crime. I definitely identify with British/Western values and I'm quite liberal. I would say I'm pretty well "integrated".

But after spending so much time in these political circles and seeing so much shit against Muslims/immigrants and about how we're trying to ruin these countries, I just feel bad. I hate Saudi Arabia, Wahhabism, Extremists and I have more reason to hate them than any of these right wing people. They're not the ones who've had their relatives killed in terrorist attacks or hear about the constant bombings in their families cities.

I feel like it's specific groups that are ruining it for the rest of us. Like actual Syrian refugees in Europe don't commit much crime, it's usually migrants from Africa. In the UK it seems to be mostly some Pakistani/Afghanistani men being backward, but to most these altright types, they see they're Muslim and assume all Muslims are like that. And it sucks because everyone I know of course hates these people for these reasons.

I can and have dealt with these feelings for a long time but the only reason I feel about bad now is because I worry about how it might effect other people who can't really deal with these feelings or if this sentiment gets more popular and could lead to harm against other people. Anyone felt a similar way? How did you deal with it? Just stop thinking about it?/u/NeoDestiny pls ban vegans.
"...which is why I simply disregard data and statistics that I don't like, like the neutral, non-partisan Pew Research statistics about Muslims, but then use data and statistics from libertarian Cato Institute founded by one of the Koch Brothers to justify mass immigration to be good for the economy." ~ DestinySlightly inspired by the recent discussions between Destiny and his mother on stream that got posted here, I thought some people might be interested in [this article](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/4/20/17109764/deepfake-ai-false-memory-psychology) \(Warning: Long Read\) by Vox Science Reporter Brian Resnick. It considers the as yet unexplored overlap between the well scientifically documented malleability of our memories and the impact of media to create false memories, especially considering the advent of technology capable of forging convincing faked images and videos.

Reflecting on this, I find it compelling to observe that one of the key themes of the Enlightenment \(and individuals opinions who directly derive inspiration from it\) was encouraging the individual to trust the evidence of their own senses when at odds with the claims to authority of institutions.

I fear contrary to this belief, we may be entering a period when institutions with integrity, and trust in them, is the last and best hope we'll have for maintaining a shared baseline of what is true.Okay now that I have you attention,

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/23/a-vigilante-state-acehs-citizens-take-sharia-law-into-their-own-handsActually no, I came out of the theaters watching Infinity War and wondering, what you guys think about the movie?I'm not fully caught up on the memes, but it sounds like nobody has told Destiny that you can disable the Bixby button without jailbreaking it.There was an update a few months ago to disable the single press and hold functions by going to the Bixby settings. 

But he got a new phone so ripHey I'm looking for that graph that was posted on reddit that had the differences between accused and arrested Republicans vs Democrats. 

I need it to own the libs WHY IS THIS A THING?!!?! ARE ALL RIFLES BY DESIGN SEMI AUTOMATIC?Again, I was never that good at starcraft, but in the last mission when you kill the new overmind you're to command 400 max units (200 each) of both terran and protoss units.

Now, this is a fucking nightmare. If anybody has ever played 4s in sc2 and tried to use a person's base for more than just a second collection of minerals and gas, you'll know that micro managing an entirely different hotkey setup and modus operandi is fuck all stupid.

Every single strategy guide I've seen, since I'm not a beta male cuck or a nerd and didn't use cheats, has said to LITERALLY amass units and march right at the overmind and kill it. I did this because I suck, but not because I'm a loser.

It's a literal suicide march and the cutscene you see is Tassadar killing himself to top the overmind. Is that not one of the most clever things in video games?Why did he need the portapotty?**Previously on reddit**

[](/Abathur)I am enjoying the discussion between Dan and the communist guy on stream right now.

I just thought I would throw out an idea for a form of government that would probably satisfy both sides of the argument.

1: Besides pure libertarians, most people acknowledge the existence of some market failures, where government taxation and intervention makes sense.

So, this means having a legislature decide which entities to tax, and which entities to fund.

Basically the idea is, instead of having different types of entities, for profit vs charities vs government services, let people just freely create financial entities.

Each financial entity just gets a number, and needs to submit a report of all it's activities. What it sold, what it bought, what it built, who it served.

All this info gets fed into an AI, and the AI decides which entities are for profit companies, which ones are charities, and which ones are providing public infrastructure.

Entities would be competing with each other to provide public services, to avoid getting taxed.

The AI would need to be able to calculate the utility provided by each entity to society, and would fine and subsidize different entities to level out the overall utility contribution of each entity.

How do you define utility? Elected representatives would define utility. This would be their only job. They would have a democratic process to adjust the definition of utility. That would be the only formal part of the government. Various financial entities, funded by the AI would take care of everything else.Stop bringing in 19 year old morons to defend Trump. I would whoop your ass on live feed, while your 12 year old fans weep.

Destiny knows he can't have a real debate with someone who knows something. Hmu, bitch. I'll make you cry on Youtube.

EDIT: Accoring to MrMouton, he backed down. Scared to debate someone who might make him look stupid, I guess. The invitation is always on the table

Honest to god, is this an elaborate troll?I remember that Destiny wanted to do a more prepared third debate with ABL. Why did he never do it?I started thinking about how many people who follow the whole anti-SJW shtick since Gamergate are young and are still young or at least living with their parents. 

[Considering record levels of Millenials and Zoomers still living with their parents](https://www.thestreet.com/lifestyle/more-millennials-are-living-at-home-with-mom-and-dad-14586153), it starts to make sense why they're scared of leftists and "SJWs":

Because they're scared of ending up as one.

When you live with conservative parents, you want to rebel. But you're scared of getting kicked out for having different opinions, and so you end up as either a "Libertarian", an "Anti-SJW" or even Alt-Right just so that you can have a different opinion from your parents while not pissing them off.

After seeing countless Destiny debates with MiBonnell, I can see why Destiny no longer stays with his parents. I seriously doubt Mamastiny would allow Destiny to stay in her home if Destiny does a lot of politics and philosophy debates.Is this a sign of racism/stupidity/honesty/neither. I just want to hear other opinionsHere on this vid at [10:50](https://youtu.be/4kfAo2Lk4mA?t=652), he literally defended the Islamic pedophilia of Muhammad marrying and fucking a 9 year old Aisha by stating that 'we shouldn't judge past people on current morals'  


Anyone who understands anything about Islam would know that the vast majority of Muslims don't just view Muhammad as some 'past person' whose morals are only relative to the culture of his time and place. He is viewed as not only a Prophet of God, but also is considered the perfect man who's moral code should be imitated by all Muslims. In fact this is a mainstream concept called [the sunnah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunnah), where Muslims try their best to immitate the morals and teachings and lifestyles of the Prophet and his companions. This is why it's so hard for many Islamic countries to raise the age of consent for marriage, because according to sunnah, a person is eligible for marriage as soon as they hit puberty, and any law that goes against this is seen by many Muslims as unislamic, including modern contemporary consent laws.  


Destiny keeps saying that he's being objective, but literally every time the topic of Islam comes up he pulls out stupid apologia shit like this and say the dumbest naive stuff ever. I honestly can't remember the last time he ever said any substantive criticism of Islam, on the otherhand I keep seeing Destiny time and time again make dumbass comments defending Islam like this.

I'm not trying to be rude, but I feel as though this entire post was directed to someone other than me. Part of why I feel this way is because none of these arguments are contradicting any points that I made - and I would challenge the author of this post to find a single statement of mine that would lead him to believe I think tariffs are a good idea in a vacuum or in principle. To the contrary, I stated that in this one circumstance - where the U.S. seems to have a legitimate bone to pick with the tariffs its products are subject to - tariffs seem like a good short term option to force other countries, especially China, to open their markets and lower their protectionist policies. Included in those policies are strict laws regarding the surrender of U.S. corporate intellectual property, strict laws regarding U.S. citizens sitting on boards of Chinese companies, expensive tariffs on our exports to Chinese markets, and outright restrictions on certain U.S. owned enterprises in China. 

[https://money.cnn.com/2016/07/12/news/economy/china-trade-donald-trump/index.html](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n3pFFPSlW4)

I made no argument with regards to trade deficits being an inherently unfavorable condition. I made no argument that tariffs would have no affect on businesses small or large. I took econ 101 and I understand the basic ideas of specialization and competitive advantage - even if I am not educated enough to use them properly  during an impromptu debate. I would appreciate some clarity on specific things I said that you disagree with, besides the ones listed below that I correct here, and attempted to correct during the debate.

This is a very interesting anthropology topic that I would love to talk with him more about because I think he’s going about it all wrong. I tried to get his attention in d.gg chat but all I got was other viewers telling me to stop tone policing. And then when I went into the discord, no one wanted go talk to me in voice about it. I’m planning on emailing him later tonight, too. If anyone would like to talk to me about this, I would love to try and iron out some of my arguments.**Previously on reddit**

[](/Abathur)I actually don't have time to write a lot on this (for once, sort of nice) so hopefully I don't.

It seems to me that they don't really need to be completely at odds. I think it makes sense for a society to have some definition of utility / outcomes that are valued morally, but still attribute values to actions anyway.

Why? It's a practical matter. Often the details of a particular situation make it difficult to determine what the ultimate outcome of some action is.

However, society can still label some actions as good and some actions as bad based on a utilitarian understanding of what will normally happen as a result, regardless of the specifics of each case.

So you might still have a utilitarian moral understanding in a society, but for that reason you could attribute value to actions and not consequences anyway.I seriously believe that she will be starting her own online career.

[](/Abathur)https://np.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/9smit6/axios_trump_to_terminate_birthright_citizenship/I think one of Steve's best points he's bought up on debates is about the 'personal choice' of people and how for the most part individuals in a group all acts the same and those who are born poor tend to stay poor. 

It seems like people like Sargon and so many of skeptos like Sinatra and the random Brit who came on for a bit during that debate all believe that every individual is independent and can literally CHOSE to make more money and get a better job. They make so many ridiculous points I won't list them now, but I'm interested in where I can read more about this perspective to better understand where they are coming from, and also I want to see where I can read more about Destiny's view.

I think this is one of his most important points because a lot of the skeptos seems to agree with Destiny and not even know it, because what he's saying just is true. So if he got to fully acknowledge that they believe this then you can move on to actually debating different solutions to the problem. That being said, he should probably not be too brash and get into the determinism memes because if they're having trouble agreeing with these more basic ideas it's not worth talking about the philosophy of these ideas. Good example of where time was wasted with this is with Sinatra.

The main point that I've seen between Sinatra, Sargon and others is that there is a culture within poor people which is against education and getting work, so what's the response to that? I don't believe this culture truly exists because I'm sure they realise that if they could just 'chose' to be richer and better off, they would. The issue is with Sargon who even if you got him to agree about these predictability stuff, would still say that because of this culture, they wouldn't want to transition to becoming richer because it means they will have a period of time without the welfare state supporting them.I randomly tuned in and it seems like he was talking to Amos Yee, a girl, and someone called Andy (Warski I'm guessing based on his Twitter)

What's up? He hasn't tweeted anythingWatching yesterday's, with Blair White, Amos Yee boi and Andy Warski. And holy shit dude because he acted differently you can tell that everyone there viewed him differently, in a better way in fact.

Also, he needs to just embrace when people are being kind to him, especially Andy. The guy was being really kind to Destiny but Destiny wasn't really reciprocating that, but if he did it would be really beneficial. Furthermore, I think it's the first time he's ever successfully explain the anecdote shit to these people and Andy at least somewhat understood why it wasn't a great way to make a point.

There are a few people on the "skepto" side who he's made change their views on him such as Patricia (?) and now Andy. Amos also clearly views Destiny as the only guy who is able to understand his arguments.

Destiny needs to get back to his honey &gt; vinegar new year resolution. Could cause a major shift in the department store of cognitive functions.Every night it's the same, as soon as anything happens in league that annoys or exites you: **SHOUT RIGHT INTO THE FUCKING MIC** 1 mm away from it and cause clipping. I've never watched any stream where the low -&gt; high audio levels are so polarized. 

Why spend all that time and energy, when the end result is more aids than tyler1's audio? When you know you scream so much, why not apply a compressor?

[](/OverRustle) [](/OverRustle) [](/OverRustle) There are a lot of things about Lauren Southern that you can criticize about, like her religious traditional conservative views and her right-wing libertarian politics in general, but what she is clearly not is a neo-nazi white nationalist trying to usher in the ethnostate. 

Here are some of the reasons people are claiming he's a white nationalist:

&gt; She hates Islam and Muslims

Hating Islam isn't white nationalism, it's fucking commonsense. In fact what infuritates me with people like Destiny and the leftist crowd is how much they love sucking on Islam's cock despite the religion being the antithesis to everything they believe in. Also, she doesn't hate Muslims, she hates the mass immigration of people coming from backwards cultures that may harm the fabric of society.

&gt; She hates illegal immigration/mass immigration

Again, this isn't racism, this isn't a white nationalist thing, this is just fucking common sense. I'm a brown person living in a country of mostly brown people, and me and everyone here HATE illegal immigration/mass immigration. News flash, people who cross into your country undocumented is a bad thing. Mass influx of people coming from backwards cultures without proper integration is a bad thing. Liberals:
&gt;Muslims are peaceful and tolerant who are open to progress

Also liberals:
&gt;If Trump declares Jerusalem the capital of Israel, this will anger the Muslims and make them violentBe sure to wish nathan a happy birthday&gt; claims to be against religion, including Islam

&gt; never attacks Islam and Muslims, defends them every time they get attacked, and downvotes every post or comment on the sub that attacks them

&gt;TFW no different than the septic community 

The current shitty content on Youtube was a response to Youtube's equivalent to booby streamers: Reply Girls.

Because of Reply Girls memes, Youtube took action against them but due to how big the site has become in 2012, their actions have led to alot of content creators getting fucked over (especially short content Youtubers), which resulted in the monstrosities of Sargon and SpideyElsa.

[It's one of the reasons why Youtube Rewind has been cringe-inducing shit since 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GuOjXYl5ew), since the 90% of popular content have been the exact opposite of the content creators featured in the video. [Even Emma BLACKED REEEEEE, a Youtuber featured in the Rewinds agreed with this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNsWYq7Bo9E)

And this is why eventhough booby streamers are garbage, i'd rather for the to stay on Twitch instead of any action by Twitch leading up to Twitch becoming as garbage as Youtube these days.

Hell, [the last time Twitch took action against NSFW content it resulted in a shitshow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_KPVLXf3B0). If removal of booby streamers would accidentally lead something as stupid as forbidding Destiny from donations, then i'd rather have the booby streamers stay.

If I were to choose between booby streamers or SpideyElsa of Akkad, then I'll choose booby streamers instead. Long live the booby streamers.So I've looked at a type of situation in a particular way for a while now, and I want to find out if it's fallacious in any way because the general point of view is in an opposing direction.

Example Situation: You queue up for a game of League of Legends and end up having someone disconnect on your team in the middle of the game. The reason why is irrelevant here. You end up surrendering and queuing again. What is the chance of you having another DC on your team in the next game?

Now because each game is independent of one another, you'd say that the probability is the same this time as the last. But if you look at it in a meta perspective, i.e. as a 3rd party, could you not read the question as "what is the chance of getting two DC teammates in a row?" I guess my question boils down to: if you flip a coin and get heads, what are your chances of flipping it a second time and getting heads again? Is it 50% (looking at it completely separate, independent), or 25% (looking at the whole picture, starting from the first flip)?

The game show question seems to have a "right" answer for this. It's not the best parallel, but it shows my perspective to have some merit. It goes: You are in a game show contest and are presented with three doors. Behind one of these doors is a brand new car of your liking, and behind the other two are goats (we assume you want the car). The host tells you to pick a door, and you do. After choosing, the host reveals a goat behind one of the two doors that you did not choose, and then gives you the opportunity to switch your pick with the door that he did not reveal. Do you switch, or keep your original pick? If you're having trouble imagining this, I'll give a specific: You pick door 1. Host shows that door 2 has a goat. Host asks you if you would like to switch your pick to door 3. Do you switch to door 3, or keep door 1?

The correct answer here is yes, switch doors. The math on this is very simple, and includes the "whole picture," which is my perspective in question. So from the beginning, there are two options: you picked a goat, or you picked the car. There are two doors with a goat, and one with the car, so there is a higher chance that you picked a goat. Now, if you picked the goat as your initial door, switching doors will net you the car because the host will have to reveal to you the 2nd goat, leaving the car as the only option to switch to. This situation is 66% likely to occur, contrasted with the 33% chance of you starting out choosing the car, and then keeping your original pick to net the car. If there was a T.V. which had this show playing and you walked up to it when the host asked the contestant whether he wanted to choose one of two doors, you would think that there is a 50/50 he gets the car because you didn't see what happened already.

So if you were wondering why I would ever think that my chances of having another DC on my team is lower, after I already had one my last game, this is a situation where looking at the bigger picture has benefits.



So in conclusion, I'm asking when this type of "bigger picture" perspective is the "right" choice in real life practical scenarios.**Previously on reddit**

[](/Abathur)Most of my (and probably yours too) information on net neutrality has come from supporters, so I haven't heard any legitimate arguments against net neutrality. I've tried Googling some cons, but I felt that the articles I came across were overly biased.

**Does anyone have any _CONS_ on net neutrality? I would like to discuss!**Destiny playing Factorio and PUBG with bad bunny made me realize how lackluster the streams with MrMouton truly are.

☑ benefits from being completely emotionally detached

☑ will make chat very upsetSince race realism has been brought up can someone explain to me why g loading is so important, or why iq testing is an accurate predictor of someone's intelligence.

I have always ascribed to the multiple intelligence theory. From my own experience it just appears like people have different aptitudes which go on to determine what they specialize in later in life. In the west we seem to place incredible value on logical reasoning, so someone incredibily good at math or puzzles we would say that kid is incredibly bright. On the same hand, if someone is good at say sports, or good at playing a musical instrument or entertaining we would acknowledge those traits but not necessarily ascribe it to a high IQ. 

This notion has always seemed a little wrong to me. All of these skills rely on the same human ability for reasoning.

I must be missing something Libertarians are pro-small government, anti-spending and believes in state's rights. They also oppose interventionism in other countries and also oppose foreign intervention in American politics.

However, Tara McCarthy is advocating for heavy spending of government money and resources to kick out non-whites in order to maintain a white ethnostate. She's also Australian/British, and she's technically intervening in American politics.

Isn't that the opposite of libertarianism? Not even libertarians like Rand Paul, Aleppo Weedman and Penn Jillette would support that shit.With the season finale being a vicious destruction of the Frenchie, what do we expect from this season? Completion of the dark Lily arc? The return of the Bunty King? The Andy arc taking full effect? What is race? There is no scientific way to define race because it’s a social and cultural construct so how are the idiots going to apply hard science to it. That’s not how science works. Also it’s actually impossible to test for race realism. What’s the control group? How can you test this without other factors effecting the study? They don’t even have a thesis.

It’s hard to argue against something that isn’t even real.Genuine question. I have no clue what the difference is after hearing JF or those other two lunatics talk. Using flimsy science to prove the existence of subspecies within the human race isn't exactly new to racism and I have no clue how it warrants a new name.

THESE FUCKING AFRICAN HATSELLERS ARE LITERALLY DESTROYING THE COUNTRY IF I WANT TO BUY CHEAP SHITTY HATS FROM CHINA ON THE SIDE OF THE STREET I WOULD BUY THEM FROM PURE ARYAN BLOODED WHITE MALES WHY WON'T THESE AFRICAN HATSELLERS GO SELL HATS IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY HUH?????? REEEEEE!!!!!!1111111111111111Links to them would be much appreciated.Good to see you guys are starting to realign your moral values closer to Islamic modesty culture.

**EDIT:** I change my mind. Listening from Warki's podcast, I feel there's something pretty wrong going on with JF and his gf.Destiny makes the assumption that JF would evaluate relationships in the same way a non-ideological and practical, well-adjusted 32 yr old would. 

JF however seems to only care about biologically evaluating a partner. If she is his mental equal is irrelevant. Biologically, a women is most fertile around 18-20(this is just what I have heard).

 The only criteria going through JF's mind is a) how she looks and b)what age is she(i.e. peak fertility age)

Sure this is kind of twisted, but from my knowledge JF has made the choice long ago to stop viewing things from anything other than his lense of expertise. Evolutionary biology
BECAUSE DESTINYObviously nothing new or valuable was learnt from this discussion but it's so fucking funny.Our champion returns and destroys the alt-right retards with Steven "Racist killer" Bonnel II. Klappa in the chat boys. That conclusion was very interesting. By having Metokur not be an absolute twat to Destiny, the others who were acting like monkeys calmed down and listened while Destiny explained his answers to Metokur's pretty serious questions. Metokur basically had a redebate with Destiny and it allowed Destiny to properly explain his view and Metokur understood it. FeelsGoodManDAMN THIS WAS GREAT DAMN SHITSHOW.I'm sure it probably makes him a lot of money, but gosh going through those streams must really take a toll on his mind, it's probably not worth it, especially it means losing friends.
JF i such a disengenous quack he makes me want to reach through the screen and slap him.

First of all the twin studies were *not testing between different races*, period, end of story. So why even bring this up?

Second, he conveniently fails to mention the other parts of the twin studies. The twins raised in middle class homes showed a high degree of heritability. But twins (regardless of race) that we raised in impoverished homes showed significantly less heritability..https://www.citylab.com/life/2015/12/povertys-role-in-intellectual-development/420822/

I also  had a breif exchange with him and I found out that he is an epistemological anarchist, which is a lunatic fringe position that is held by virtually no serious scientists or philosophers of science.who's still holding out hope for DestinyXLily**Previously on reddit**

[](/Abathur)During the first debate between Steve and Warski, Andy Warski defended NoBullshit and called him a "nice guy".

That should've been a red flag in the first place. NoBullshit was being dunked by even members of his own community. The CRG/sh0e/Armored crowd was getting into fights with NoBullshit because NoBullshit called sh0e a whore and sh0e got into a fight with NoBullshit again after making fun of Contrapoints' transgenderism (sh0e and Contra are close friends). Not only that, Sargon's "Nazis are bad" was made in response to NoBS defending Charlottesville and making fun of Heather Heyer's death.

So yeah, to see Warski defending NoBullshit after the three NoBS-Destiny debates and the NoBS drana of the time was very suspicious. You can see the luring of Destiny to the Youtube Bloodsports bait from there. NO ONE in both sides of YT political drama should be defending NoBS, and Destiny should've called Warski's defense of NoBS.Or will he never be banned because he's GODSTINY.I'm interested in this subreddits perception, please answer in drovesI don’t know why you guys can’t see this. I love destiny’s content and what he does in his debates, but I believe this is one instance of him being intellectually dishonest. It sure seems like throughout his debate with the vegan gains guy that destiny doesn’t really believe that you’re a hypocrite if you eat meat and own an animal as a pet, but that he’s just trying to remain consistent by any means necessary.

I think this debate is an instance where destiny just doesn’t want to be proven wrong. This whole debate is just destiny trying to save face.  Because who honestly believes that you’re a hypocrite if you own a dog and then go eat some shitty grocery store sushi.Well Mr.Bonnell how about you face off against the 4th place top American finisher in Street Fighter 2 Super Turbo in 2005 EVO, that's right... Phil "DarksydePhil" Burnell in a first to 10 in any fighting game :^)I want to challenge my thoughts I've had over a nuanced topic. If you've any thought out opinions, please leave a comment.

# Lab Rats  

Does anyone who loves animals *__(not just fucking dogs and cats)__* detest animal studies? Are you against the use of animals to advance medicine and biology? Why or why not?  
Remember that the study of animals in labs has immensely progressed human life in many ways, and you would have to address these benefits versus the lives of the animals.


Please don't talk about being okay with certain studies that may be less "cruel" than others. I'm only interested in the acceptance/rejection of the topic, not an iffy in between statement.

[](/Abathur)So according to the debate with Destiny, Dank Cunt said that he lost his job because of the media coverage of "The Nazi Pug". Maybe he shouldn't have taught his dog the Nazi salute then? That's literally no different than [parents teaching Chinese kids to hate the Japanese and then having that blew up in their faces](https://www.chinasmack.com/chinese-family-ashamed-after-little-japanese-boys-visit)

I consider teaching kids racism to be child abuse, and so I also consider teaching animals the Hitler salute to be animal abuse.

https://www.change.org/p/reddit-com-r-destiny-bring-destiny-back-to-starcraftjust sayin[Fantastic read on the fondly-remembered casualty of this decade's events, the assumption of good faith, and how it has affected Wikipedia](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/03/12/wikipedia-wars-inside-fight-against-far-right-editors-vandals-and-sock-puppets)



**I would strongly encourage reading the whole thing but for those of you that may not have time, here is an extract:** 'The far-right’s activity on Wikipedia is relatively easy to manage when it clearly violates one of the site’s policies, such as vandalism, harassment, ad hominem attacks or edit-warring, which refers to dueling edits by one or more factions outside of the normal dialogue mechanism. But it’s much harder to keep editors in check when they dance on the line between acceptable and unacceptable behavior — this is known as “civil POV.” Civil POV is when an editor or a group of editors tries to tilt an article to a particular point of view but remains polite and abides by site-wide norms of behavior.

Wikipedia’s policies are more oriented toward conduct than content, said Magnus Hansen, a postdoc fellow at the University of Copenhagen who has been editing on Wikipedia for more than 10 years.

“That means that it is hard to get users blocked or restricted for consistently providing ideologically skewed content, unless it can be demonstrated that they are deliberately breaking the community’s rules for conduct or content creation,” Hansen said, citing the case of one user who repeatedly made antisemitic pages and when called out on it, claimed he was acting in good faith.

One of the bedrock principles of Wikipedia is the assumption of good faith. Unless there is evidence to the contrary, edits are assumed to be made with the intent of improving the encyclopedia. Editors who attempt to insert their ideological bias but maintain the semblance of civility are given the benefit of the doubt until their disruption becomes apparent enough to warrant action by administrators. Civil POV-pushers can disrupt the editing process by engaging other users in tedious and frustrating debates or tie up administrators in endless rounds of mediation. 'Btw guys I've just got done cleaning my sweet AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle just in time for the gun show nearby, probably gonna visit the gun store get a bump stock for this baby as well. Gawd I love my second amendment rights #nra4ever #donttreadonme #fuckthecommiesI actually had fun listening to Destiny discussing with Discord chat on stream. Hell, I too had fun talking about Mussolini's hot granddaughters with an Italian memer on the stream discussion months ago.

Why not upload those to the channel? Those would make for some good Youtube content. Hell, they can also be considered debates.&gt; cheers when Lauren Southern got booted out and banned from the UK pemanently due ot 'racism'

&gt; cheers when Count Dankula gets convicted because he trained a pug to do Nazi jokes

&gt; cheers when Vox slanders Sam Harris in an obviously attempt of character assassination

&gt; cheers when Tommy Robinson gets banned from twitter

Is this what Destiny fans have devolved into? Brainless irredeemable turds who are literally everything the right wing and the centrists have warned about the far-left? Is this what contemporary left-wing liberalism has devolved into now? "meanwhile I'll just tip toe through this leftist minefield called Twitch and Youtube where saying even one trigger word can get you banned or demonetized"F to pay respects So yeah, since it's the summer break I've decided to enrol in mandatory "must pass" classes that were basically jingoistic bullshit courses created by the former government (Thanks a lot Najib, hope you rot in jail you fuck).

Anyways, so the class started and within the first 10 minutes he pulled the "gheyz destroyed Roman civilization" meme and then said "gheyz are destroying the West meme". He threatened my friend by forcing him to describe what is a lesbian and I told him not to answer because he clearly wants to insult my friend and call him a heathen.

And then, he ranted about how if you hang out with transgenders, you will end up being transgender yourself. 5 minutes later, he goes into a rant about Ice Creams and Gelatos. And then 5 minutes, he goes back into the same exact rant about transgenders and how you should avoid hanging out with transgenders if you don't want to end having a vagine replace your cock.

And to imagine how the lecture looks like, imagine your [average Jordan Peterson lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ep5fCJZ8) conducted by [Don Beveridge](https://youtu.be/_igaLv7ro8o?t=21m59s) instead. 

Seriously, this shit is some great meme material, my dudes. I might do a weekly post about all my lectures just to record all the insanity that is happening within this "Islamic and Southeast Asian Civilization" classoh wait leftist Twitch just banned Erisann for her attire lolI know you have the books and all, but my grandfather received presents from the KKK therefore black people made bad choices, SIR!

Well, I gotta go. My plantation is calling for me, SIR!With Senpai having a panic attack I thought I'd give a few pieces of advice for dealing with them that have helped me in the past. 


Firstly, recognizing what's going on and reminding yourself that it is temporary. Just understanding the situation and repeating to yourself that everything is fine will do a lot to get in control of your body.


Secondly, try to isolate yourself if you can (this is personal preference). I find that when I'm having a panic attack, being around others only makes the experience worse. I've found trying to isolate myself, even sometimes in darkness, allows me to focus on my breathing and getting my mind right.

Thirdly, BREATHE. It's so important to control your breathing when having a panic attack. The better you can slow your breathing and take deep, full breaths, the less time they should last.


Lastly, if they continue, Steven, please see a doctor. Anxiety attacks can be incredibly brutal and serious. If you feel like it's taking a toll on you please see a professional and get help.


Stay safe buddy, we all love you. Destiny is talking about a mass purge of people on this subreddit, and generally not making too much sense. I feel like I missed some context about what is going on. He keeps saying people in this sub are sjw's and that his "thought processes" are different. Which does not really make sense given the fact that all people do here is jerk him off. Even defending the fact that he has said he is narcissistic/sociopathic multiple times. Can someone fill me in real quickThe fact that Destiny doesn't do some of his streams and debates in Spanish is a bigger crime IMO. I want Destiny to target Uncle Juans as well.WTF is this commie shit? Let's be honest about these Uncle Tom alt-right black personalities: They're literally all in for the money.

I mean, here's a pattern I've noticed: People like Candace Owens, Anthony Brian Logan, Jesse Lee Peterson and SomeBlackGuy claimed that Black People are in deep shit because "they made worse choices than white people", but when asked to provide a cause and solution they refused to provide either.

They will refuse ANY theory or fact about African Americans that are not "choices", because accepting any theory other than that would anger conservatives, as pretty much every problem and solution surrounding African American issues revolves around government spending, and conservatives hate that. Therefore, they pay Uncle Toms to spout "choice" memes so that they can say "See? This negro agrees with me. I don't have to care about black people issues and have my money go to welfare queens because this negro said so. It's not our fault, it's the negro's fault they made bad choices, and this negro said so!" 

As seen in tonight's debate with ABL, [Destiny's last debate with ABL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJc2bd31afQ), and [Destiny debating another Uncle Tom months earlier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-1t8gj_Edw), it's literally the same "black people make shit choices, I don't know why and I don't know how to solve it but I'm just saying it so that racist white people can give me money" arguments. ABL kept refusing to answer why black people make bad choices, whereas the other Uncle Tom said that "he's busy" when the Italian Discord guy asks him if he's going to help reduce black people from making bad choices.

You know something is fucking fishy when you have growing sector of people who come into a discussion only with a claim but without a hypothesis and exist only to provide confirmation bias.If it's true that more black babies are aborted than born, [which is true in NY](http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2015/nov/25/cynthia-meyer/cynthia-meyer-says-more-black-babies-are-aborted-n/), then it's reasonable to assume that access to abortion is not a huge problem to the black community, or at least blacks have a decent access to abortion medicine and services. 

If Destiny wants to claim that there is a significant percentage of blacks who do not have access to abortion medicine and services, then that's an extraordinary claim that requires evidence to be proven true, since this statement is not apparent from what we are seeing. 

TLDR: ABL's claim that there is no problem with black access to abortion is reasonable by default, the burdern of proof lies on Destiny to prove otherwise.I'm pretty sure limiting meat production from livestocks of cattle above 40kg would reduce carbon emissions in a huge way. And chicken steak and fish steak are very underrated.
So how is diversity ruining Europe again?He's playing copywritten music on stream. RIP vod watchers. Yesterday I got shot at a gym PEPEoops they've accidentally destroyed Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 lolI, of course, was talking about [President Hassan Rouhani](https://news.sky.com/story/irans-president-hassan-rouhani-warns-donald-trump-against-mother-of-all-wars-11445123), leader of a Islamic fascist country that jails women for not covering up and hangs gay people in public squares.https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001494012-Discord-Partnership-Requirements

It say's it was updated a couple hours ago. I'm not sure if it's always been like this or if this effects Destiny.

Edit: Oh wow. The porn channels are gone and now you can't use any sort of racist/able-ist language, including calling something/someone "autistic" or "retarded".Thanks for platforming ABL, Destiny. I've gone full Neo-Nazi . OverRustle /

[](/Abathur)I haven't been able to watch him live so I just skim through the vods, but he has them unlisted now, so does anyone know how to view or will I be forever out of memes? =(The way he says these words during the 1v5 sounds like his views is what's being shared with the rest of the universe.

Does he seriously think that if other alien races invade, they'll institute a puritan Handmaid's Tale dictatorship where gays will get executed and that human females will be forced to breed babies at home? Did he pull a Peterson and thought that Star Trek and Doctor Who are Christian propaganda?

Also, words like "cosmic order" are considered blasphemous to the Catholic Church hundreds of years ago. I mean, Galileo got executed for suggesting such ideas. So to see a "staunch Catholic" like Fuentes suggesting ideas like "Cosmic Order" is a bit ironic don'cha think.**Previously on reddit**

[](/Abathur)Over the past couple of months I've noticed a series of race specific dating guides posted to the Red Pill. Indian men wrote articles for other Indian men to help address specific Indian issues. Asian men have done the same and so have Blacks. In my opinion this is a positive development as race and culture have substantive influence on dating. The Red pill is predominantly American, Canadian, English and Australian. Which is to say, the Red Pill is mostly white. So why haven't Whites written anything for other Whites? There is nothing racist about Indians writing for other Indians, so why can't we Whites get in on the action? Luckily for you guys Red Pill Superstar GayLubeOil is here to answer your most pressing White dating question: How To Stuff Your White Meat Into Asian Girls.

Why Asian Girls?

There are three things Asian mothers hate: shoes on in house, checking their blind spot and chubby daughters. Asian fat shaming has single handedly saved generations of Asian women from the unfuckability epidemic experienced by Whites and especially Blacks. On top of that, Asian women are generally less television brainwashed as their parents forced them to practice violin for 6 hours a day. In other words White women have made themselves intolerable, pushing White men towards the Asian persuasion. Finally college campuses have been completely taken over by Asians since they actually study for the SAT, meaning their is a wide selection.

Choosing the Right Asian:

Contrary to popular belief, not all Asian girls are the same. They might sort of look alike, squeak like IKEA furniture when intercoursed , and shuffle their flip flops everywhere they go however, there are key differences you must consider in making your selection. The most important factor is when her family immigrated. First and second generation Asians retain their culture while third generation+ are a gamble and may be westernized shitshows like Ellen Pao. The next thing to consider is whether or not she has white friends. Asians who have white friends are more likely to sleep with white dudes than those who exclusively hang in Asian cliques. Finally: Does she conform to Asian beauty standards? If she isn't ultra petite, ghost pale and lacks an eye fold, she is looked down upon by other Asians. White men don't give a fuck about that shit. Which means there is an excellent opportunity to ball up some Asian girls with low self esteem.

Act White:

The key to getting any interracial action is not being an apologetic pussy. When white guys talk to Asian girls usually the first thing they do is supplicate by trying to show how Asian friendly they are. Asian girls don't care that you like Sudoku, Teriyaki and Anime body pillows. You deciding to submit to her Asian ways raises more red flags then Saigon in 1975. The white guys who do best with Asian girls aren't the ones who wear robes and have samurai sword collections they are the white guys who act white. Asian girls that want to sleep with white guys want to sleep with White White Guys like Channing Tatum who act white and do white bro things. They are looking for an invitation into White World with its footballs, barbecues, and plaid shirts. That's the fantasy. So don't cock block yourself by saying weird or controversial shit.

Dating Asian Girls:

The key to setting up a date with an Asian girl in College or Grad School is using the phrase: Study Break. Memorize this phrase because it is your key to China Vagina. Asian girls love talking about how busy they are with school. Help them rationalize forgoing productivity for reproductivity by saying something like: "Wow O Chem sounds so much worse than my Jurisprudence class. You should come over for a study break. My bros are going to watch football and eat ribs. An Asian girl who is somewhat attracted to you can't say no to that. It gives her an exciting White guy story where she did White things, that she can use for social validation. RM79 spent on ribs and mashed potatoes is a great price for Vietnamese Tunnel. Also girls who just ate are more fun, happier and easier to fuck.

Contrast Game:

The essence of Contrast Game is doing the opposite of what Average Frustrated Chumps do. When flirting with Asian girls AFC's default to cultural sensitivity. What country are you parents from? Oh that's so cool my brother went on vacation in China . That's weak and kills conversation faster than smartphones. Which is why you should default to mild to moderate cultural insensitivity. Girls who don't enjoy insensitivity may be "Mattress Girl" tier SJWs, so its good to screen them early. Here are some things to try: If she hits you accuse her of Karate chopping. Occasionally remind her that this is America and that we have freedom here. If she says "Wow that's fucked up." Agree. Don't apologize.

In the 90's and early 2000's weird, fat awkward, middle class White guys could score hot Asian women. Those days are long gone. White women have become so insufferable that they have driven up the SMV of Asians. Asian girls are no longer the easy option they once were.

[Here's prominent Uncle Toms at a major Uncle Tom gathering in the 80s](https://i.imgur.com/kTNF6mM.jpg)

Uncle Toms are dangerous to our society. Not only are they brainwashing black people like Kanye into saying that slavery was a choice, they've also murdered and raped prominent black and white women too.

Shouldn't we start detain more Uncle Toms before they commit more crimes? I've seen footage of OJ Simpson murdering Nicole while saying "I'm not black, I'm OJ", and I've also had footage of Bill Cosby raping women while telling black people to wear their pants high. Based on this info, we know that Uncle Toms commit more crimes than poor whites, and thus we shouldn't let any of them into the gene pool monkas.

Uncle Tom genocide when?I mean he's also in Seattle, so how when is the double date gonna happen? It'd be some real OuO shit, Phil could teach Destiny about taxes and buying cars.**Previously on reddit**

[](/Abathur)AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO SEES THIS FUCKING LINE?9/11 ultimately served many purposes but it was primarily a mass ritual to create an enormous amount of loosh energy to be harvested by the Archons (parasites). The towers were specifically built to be destroyed in this ritual and they have a lot of symbolism surrounding them. They represent Boaz and Jachin, the two pillars of entrance to the Temple of Solomon. Consider verse 9:11 of Revelation: “They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon and in Greek is Apollyon (that is, Destroyer).” They also represent the number 11, which is an important number to them. I’m not exactly certain what the significance of 11 is but it may have to do with the 1-1 duality that generates conflict and destruction.

The fact that this tragedy was a ritual is just disgusting. What’s even worse is that these entities have manipulated humanity so that they’ve done it to themselves.

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8kim02/911_was_a_mass_human_sacrifice/dz7z3xc/Livestreamfail in the past was more than just a place where there were clips of people failing on stream, it was more a hub of highlights to stay in touch with what was happening on different streams.  


I'm a fan of IRL streams. I really liked Byrons trip to Japan, I liked the Destiny Badbunny IRL streams. I like some of the offlineTV stuff too, and I think there is a lot of unexplored potential with the form still.  


However, I am just not a fan of Ice Poseidon's stream at all. To me, it seems to have this aura of desperation and doom and it's just not my thing at all. Basically livestreamfail seems like its reaching up to 80&amp;#37; plus that style of content now, and I would like to have some alternative to that subreddit.  


I'm not saying that he should stop doing it. Maybe he should, but that is not the main point I am trying to making here. What I am trying to say is that stuff is just a different genre of stream, and it should be possible to distinguish that kind of edgestream from the type of stream that I am more interested in watching.  


It's ok if there are more than 1 genre of livestream, but I don't want to be stuck using the subreddit that is mostly for the genre of it that I don't like.

Is there a different subreddit for livestream clips that would be more my style? If there isn't there are other people that probably feel the same way, and we should probably make one.  


Maybe like WholesomeLivestream? LivesStreamWin? Idk. I just don't really like going to livestreamfail anymore.Also, let's hire teachers who are racists in order to stop any future racist attacks against students.This game really brings out the best of destiny: the competitiveness, mgtow, and autism all at once.

[](/Abathur)When I was an Adult, I experienced something unbelievable. My ego died through a series of drug-related [incidents](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/371752849987600387/488322051501981698/unknown.png), and my mind was changed forever.  
The experience was impossible.  
And it made me the impossible.  
Secretly, i use my autism to fight conservatives and bring social justice to the internet.  
I am, Destiny. For me it's gotta be SC2 2v2s with Lily. Destiny needs to keep playing with Lily but is enjoying starcraft (all is right with the world again). There are invariably a ton of viewers who are watching destiny play SC2 and would love to learn how to play. Lily has expressed an interest in playing in the past. Destiny teaching Lily/audience by aggressively telling her what to do seems too high in quality meme potential to not happen.

I’m g’not a g’nelf

I’m g’not a g’noblin

I’m a gnome and you’ve been GNooOoOooOomedIt's obviously just a carbon copy of empowered sonicHey guys just wanted to make a small casual post about a video Destiny watched part of today. I just wanted to say that this was really helpful for me personally and I know this is a big topic with a lot of communities especially with gaming and streaming. I don't know of a streamer who hasn't had a message asking them how they deal with depression or how much they've personally helped with depression and I thought it would be cool to link this video. As a community we're pretty shut off from everyone else but that's also a good thing in terms of how close some of us are.

Depression is a motherfucker for a lot of us and its been a hot topic in many clinical fields and communities. That video that Destiny watched a few weeks ago with a college professor claiming it was the most destructive disorder and how it can tear a human down and make every day tasks seem impossible really opened my eyes to my personal shortcomings and my own depression that I was denying. It really helped me realize what a slippery slope that feeling was and starting to like that feeling in an odd abusive way. This motivated me to really find a remedy for it, which for me was therapy that I started a couple of weeks ago and has really shed some light on things in my life I was letting get to me and making me feel that way.

Anyway here's the video and I hope you guys reach out to me personally if you need someone to talk to because I get it. I mean even the mighty mouton as we know has been dealing with this himself, no one is really immune to feeling alone and useless. (Especially after listening to Destiny talk about how pointless existence is for 3 hours.) For me personally it helps knowing there are people who are there for me and will listen. I think a lot of people in chat and in this subreddit are free and willing to help another chatter out. Hope this inspires some of you dealing with this to seek help and really start trying to get out of that rut that can feel almost unbeatable.

Was he talking about state *run* media like RT And CCRTV, or just state financed like the BBC, CBC or even something like PBS?They think im funny, but they dont know that I am as empty as starcraft 2’s ladderBased on Destiny's critique of HarrisIs / ought gap.

I'm not a Sam Harris fan, but I don't begrudge him for trying to solve philosophy. I think that is what everyone interested in philosophy should be trying to do.

What ought to exist is good.

So, this may seem circular, because ought is often used as a morally loaded word, but I want to build this sentence up from a different perspective.

Let’s try to construct the word ought without the morality baked in, and instead imagine “ought” to be the best guess available in the absence of complete information.

For example, say we are looking at the measurable properties of a bridge, without any moral preferences. We ask the question, will the bridge collapse if we walk on it? This could be a morally agnostic question, simply regarding the structure of the bridge.

We can check the bridge for obvious signs of damage, and test it in various ways, and conclude that the bridge ought to hold. This involves inference from the incomplete information that we are able to gather. It’s our best guess, but crucially it’s not in itself a moral preference.

If we had every bit of information, there would be no ought involved. We would be able to tell for certain whether or not the bridge will collapse.

I was going to try to go further and look at why some things ought to exist and some things ought not to exist, but it’s actually not necessary. If ought is defined without a moral context the gap is already closed.

What ought to exist, meaning our best guess at what would exist in the future, is good.

So that is part one.

The inevitable counter: What if our judgement about ought to be is just a product of our incomplete information about objective reality, that means it is just an illusion given our ignorance of reality. Therefore, if this is the case that illusion would be subjective and not itself a part of objective reality.

I think there exists objectively unknown / unknowable things. If we had all the information, there would still be unknowns, therefore there would still be inferences to be made without complete information.

Therefore, even in a world of perfect objective information, there would still be oughts, which are our inferences regarding areas where we lack complete information.

I sort of hesitate to bring in computer science examples, but I think they are relevant and interesting.

An example of something that is unknowable, is the algorithm to universally determine if an input program will halt or not. If we had access to some oracle that could give us all possible knowledge, the structure of this algorithm would still be unknowable. This point should not be a surprise, it’s a consequence of Turing's proof that the halting problem is undecidable.

I think it’s cool that because of this we can determine that the oracle would be unable to describe it’s inner workings, because the oracle would need to contain some device that can’t exist if it could provide infinite truths about everything, algorithms included. That is not really part of the argument but I think it is sort of interesting.

So, if the oracle has given us all possible objective information, then we have removed any subjective or relative illusions of our human perception. However, even in this perfect objective world, there are still unknowns.

Therefore, the unknowns that remain, and the inferences to be made about them, are part of objective reality. Once the oracle has given us all the information, there are no more subjective illusions. But if we still need to make inferences regarding unknowns, that means those inferences that we make cannot be subjective illusions from our lack of information.

Therefore, if we determine what ought to be true regarding unknowns in the situation where we have every bit of information, we could only be determining objective morality.Hosting BadBunny**Previously on reddit**

   I always know I’m going to have something to look forward to when I get to the bottom of the page. I never ever agree with any of you, but it’s nice that you have the gusto to keep at it and still remain here.

I don’t even mean this in a “look at them and laugh” kinda way. I honestly get really fucking bored sometimes and the fact that the conversations are almost always so compelling is really nice.

Fuck highly evolved ape tho.First of all, not all values are moral values. My preference for cheesecake over lemon meringue is a values, but it's hardly a moral one.  Second, even if we grant this, it does nothing to demonstrate that moral values are facts. It is incumbent upon him to demonstrate that moral values are anything more than mere personal preferences. With the Trump administration now trying to limit legal immigration into the country and Laura Engram on Fox News now saying that both legal and illegal immigration are to blame for “massive demographic changes that most of us don’t like”, I can’t help but feel like the narrative is shifting more and more towards a watered down, white ethnostate being preferable to what we have now. Thoughts?

"Hi, I'm Boruto Uzumaki and I am the son of the seventh hokage and Hinata Hyuga. I have access to my very own unique dojutsu which grants me powers from the sharingan and the byakugan, allowing me to utilize the taijutsu form of the gentle fist. I have proficiency in three nature transformations and I have my own original 'vanishing rasengan' that only I can do and I also made it by accident. My sensei is LITERALLY sasuke uchiha. Also, I saved the world at 12 years of age from an actual god in another dimension."I really enjoyed videos about failed social media events like Dashcon, dead memes like rage faces and washed up Youtubers like Ray William Johnson. But one thing I noticed about these guys is that they're willing to hang out with The Alt-Right and Anti-SJW Youtubers for some reason.

If there's any reason why I dropped Internet Historian, [it's his collaboration video with Brittany Venti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC84JA6EGo4) even with her history of being an awful person. I enjoyed his content on Fyre Festival and Dashcon, but he made his political stances clear by aligning with Brittany Venti so fuck him I guess.

I'm also disappointed with Fredrik Knudsen, whom despite having an empathetic worldview [still had to pay lip service to Mister Metokur during the whole #ChangetheChannel debacle even though 90% of MM's claims against Channel Awesome are gossipy, transphobic bullshit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwOVNVhokWA)

And while Quinton Reviews did collaborations with LeftyTubers like Lindsay Ellis, [he still happily hangs out with Chris RayGun and Shoe0nhead during VidCon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E62D8DmoM0&amp;t=1s) and I'm kind of disappointed with him on that.

Also, let's not forget another "Youtube History" memer: GamerFromMars. [He claimed that Jontron is a target of a media witch hunt instead of Jontron actually being a racist prick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiYb9Bb6Djs).

Is there anyone who does "Internet/Youtube/Meme History" videos that doesn't align with The Alt-Right and Anti-SJWs? And why isn't there a Hbomberguy/Shaun type lefty in the "Internet/Youtube/Meme History" community? Does researching old school Internet make you more comfortable aligning with the Right-Wing or something?I believe this is the fundamental argument which can change someones stances on a lot of the social policy arguments Destiny has had.

The main argument Destiny had, where the other person didn't change their mind because they were too stupid to even understand the argument, can be found here: https://youtu.be/6FI90Wos60w

Does anyone have academic literature that makes the same argument Destiny is making, backed up by examples and data? Also, if anyone has something which debunks the argument or something which provides a different outlook, I'd be interested.

I understand that the philosophical thought behind it is generally linked to determinism but the main argument opposed to it seems to be free will which just seems weak. Also the philosophy behind it is usually way too deep to get into in any actual debate or discussion with most people.

Some keywords related to this, but I haven't found the kind of literature I want for it: social reproduction, agency, personal autonomy, individualism etc.

I know plato.stanford.edu has some stuff on these, but that's not going to be helpful in a debate as it's too abstract. How else can someone be convinced of this world view if the standard argument Destiny gives in that video does nothing? To me it seems like a lost cause in that case unless they can convince me that my position is wrong.**Previously on reddit**

[](/Abathur)I think he is really just confused and that his real moral consideration is for a unique instantiation of consciousness. 

Imagine that a genetically unique zygote is conceived. Due to some unfortunate genetic abnormality it will never develope a fully functioning brain outside of what is necessary to keeps its heart and lungs functions. There will never be a "what its like to be" for this person. It will never have hopes, dreams, thoughts or even basic awareness or sensations. For all intents and purposes, it is just a body, a bunch of living human tissue. 

Does this collection of living human tissue deserve moral consideration simply because it has a unique genetic code? Or does moral consideration arise from consciousness? From the ability to suffer and feel pleasure?I think that the league subreddit's reaction to this is borerline retarded.

The Riot dude didn't "wish" cancer on anyone, he made an edgy/dumb joke that was made public. The right reaction would have been to apologise and contextualize the quote ("I was just joking around", "I don't actually hope he dies of cancer", something along those lines)  
The fact he came into that thread and tried to defend himself with that statement was idiotic. I don't think he *should* be fired, but I also wouldn't be up in arms if Riot decided to fire him, because he jsut made them look pretty bad, that thread reached frontpage #1 after all.when did the influx of latestagecapitalism retards start?Is this the same guy who thinks punching Nazis is okay and Islam is awesome?I tend to watch while drawing or some bs - they're sorta podcast-likeso you think punching Nazis is okay and Islam is awesome?I watched bits and pieces of his streams around the elections/primaries and a friend of mine watched him a lot so I had a sense of what he was like, but what turned me into a fan was the /pol/ girl video

It's been a while since I've seen that vid so I don't remember how Destiny comes across in it or how different his argumentative style is from now but it truly is a wild ride to watchso you think punching Nazis is okay and Islam is awesome?so you think punching Nazis is okay and Islam is awesome?

So you think punching Nazis is okay, but laws that discriminates Muslims are bad. Haven't heard something that hypocritical in a while.&gt;extremist Islam 

All Islam are extremist in nature. Sure, you're going to point out to your one friend Abdul who probably has somewhat liberal ideals, but trust me, he does not represent 99% of the Muslim world who largely believe in fucked-up things, like FGM, Sharia law, the immorality of LGBT and death for apostates. In fact, I reckon the percentage of white nationalists who support LGBT and women's rights  are much higher than the percentage of Muslims who support LGBT and women's rights.

And you're willing to punch Nazis, who probably has around 1 or 2 bad ideas in his head about society, yet willing to protect, condone, or even support Muslims, who largely have 1001 bad ideas in their heads about society.Channels like h3h3 (or at least what it is now) thrive on driving up moral outrage. It's a very strong feeling that captures people. If you look at their [last video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvYDPHEJ9Rg) instead of just making fun of it for being dumb, Ethan literally goes into "think of the children" outrage mode. They know what gets you clicks. I actually don't see the contradiction with the skeptic conference booting Dawkins. They are granting access to their platform, and they have a mission for that platform.

It seems consistent to value freedom of speech in general, for example value the right of Dawkins to express himself freely, and also retain their right to select speakers to amplify based on what they have freely said.

This is a pretty basic point in the discussion of free speech. Their ability to select speakers for their platform is their free speech. Most of the video seems pretty reasonable but that seemed like a pretty big oversight to me.[There have been 273 Mass shootings in America as of today. We are in the 273rd day of 2017.

thank fucking godim not sure why it would, are the people watching him really unaware of how dumb he isI don't know why this kid spends so much time trying to be the next Milo when he could be doing much more productive things at his age like travelling the world or working at the Peace Corps or some shit.

It's really baffling  &gt;Turks are against it, only kurds and some other african tribes do it.

Still doesn't solve the high prevalence of FGM in many Muslim societies.

&gt;A lot of muslim countries don't use sharia law.

On the contrary, most Muslim-majority countries have laws based on sharia. They either have separate sharia laws or include sharia-inspired laws into their federal laws.

&gt;Most religious people think the LGBT is immoral.

Still does not solve the prevalence of anti LGBT sentiment in Muslim societies, which I would argue is far worse compared in other religions, even Christianity. In white Christian America, people like Peter Thiel could go on stage in front of thousands Christian Republicans and declare his gayness and still walk out a free man, while gay pundits like Milo Younnopolis gets praised by Christian right wingers. Can you imagine something like that happen in Saudi Arabia? Pakistan? Iran? Indonesia? Hell, I live in one of the most 'moderate' Muslim-majority countries in the world and I can't imagine someone doing those things without either ending up in prison or dead.

&gt;In how many countries does that happen?

Just because it doesn't happen does not mean Muslims don't believe in this. I live in Malaysia, where there's 0 number of deaths involving apostates, but literally every Muslim I know believes that the punishment for apostasy is death. My own family believes that apostates deserve death.

Regardless, your points are moot, because my argument was that most Muslims believe in most of these things plus other forms of Islamic bullshit. Just because a Muslim doesn't believe in FGM, doesn't mean he doesn't beleive in Sharia law. Just because a Muslim is tolerant of LGBT doesn't mean they won't beat their own kids half to death if they find out they're gay. Sure, most Muslim don't believe in ALL of it, but most Muslims believe in MOST of it.

But this kid [came from a wealthy Chicago family](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/7351hh/damn_this_nick_fuentes_kid_is_a_pretty_nice_memer/dnnoebd/) and has the money to buy the equipment needed to start his so-called "career".

"Hey John, can I illegally borrow your AR15? I need to gun down a bunch of people in a mall this weekend."

"No can do, Bob. I don't own any guns anymore since they've banned it from civilian use."Yeah, and it would be significantly harder for them to do so, because instead of just going down the street and buying ccoccaine off the store shelf, they have to smuggle it from some other shithole country.&gt; What's your solution? 

Ban all guns from civilian use?

Look, it's not rocket science. Less guns = less gun violence.300 million American citizens still don't seem to have thought of this tho&gt;  so I have no idea how I could have held onto a person like this for so long

i just ignore your stream unless there's a discussion going on, that's my secretDo you not watch Rick and Morty at all recreationally? That's kind of depressing.How? It's literally the closest historical example in the 20th century and you will understand why if you have lived in Cambodia during or after such period.Well what can you do? I didn't live in the countries that had those right-wing periods thoughA huge majority of victims died of forced starvation and disease which makes it the closest there is to a peaceful ethic cleansing.

The rest were by executions, tires and landmines&gt;What is your definition of peaceful

Forced eviction, starvation and disease.

When they killed all the doctors, nurses, chefs and cooks just to force everyone to get sick and starve to death, then that is considered "peaceful".

Which is exactly Pol Pot's goal. He wanted to turn Cambodia into an agrarian state with a population resembling that of the old Khmer empires, and one of the best ways to do that is to force starvation and disease on to the population not just by moving everyone to the farms, but by also killing off the entire medical and culinary industry (and also education, tech, etc.)Well, Pol Pot considered his actions to be "peaceful" the same way Richard B. Spencer considers his belief in a genocide to be "peaceful".

Whatever you say my dudeYeah well, I was basing it on the fact that I used to live in Cambodia and was exposed to the Khmer Rouge's atrocities even after the wars ended.

&gt;"how ingrained into American culture guns are and you end up with the reality that they are never going to go away whether you really really want them to or not."

Which is why I said the only reason guns aren't banned in America is because 300 million Americans are idiots.Dunno man, I'm not the one living in a country with mass shootings almost every day. Care to take a guess which variable determines that?All this "I wouldn't even rape you" stuff is really just petty pedantic crap.

Like, seriously, let's be real, NONE of us here really thinks Sargon is going to rape a person. I think it's pretty fucking obvious to everyone, including Thomas Smith, that regardless of Sargon's politics, he's a non-rapist member of society like every one else. 

Like, ffs, Destiny goes on his livestream and shouts at autists to go kill themselves all the time. Does anybody really honestly think that's what Destiny really wants? Like, let's be honest and take these things within the context.
Well I wouldn't even rape you.Cede the North to men of strong Viking blood like a true cuck. See where it gets you.His thatistheplan meme videos that panders to anti-SJW memers are unfunny and completely unnecessary.

Does he have to pander to them? He's doing fine with Cal Chuchesta memes. Sure, but since you know you're hating on a subculture that is predominantly filled with different groups of people regardless of ethnicity and race, it's a risky humor segment that is not worth it when it comes to monetization.

I also don't have a liking for SJWs. I don't like Anita Sarkeesian and I consider the subculture to be problematic. But, I would not go that far to making my content solely about making fun of them since trying to simplify all SJWs into one humourous brush is seen as making fun of other groups of minorities.

If Fantano knows the monetary risks of making fun of a very diverse group like SJWs, then he should not complain about it when it affects his monetization. He knows that he might go too far, so it's weird why he acts like he doesn't know that this will affect monetization.

Compare Fantano to RLM and Super Best Friends. The latter two also did not like SJWs, but they DO NOT make hating SJWs the main focal point of their humor. And guess what? Both channels rarely if ever got demonetized. Sure, they don't get the same edgy 14 year old demographics that watch Pewdiepie and H3h3, but they do get to maintain a consistent stream of income and monetized content while making great adult-centric humourous content.

Hell, Destiny makes fun of SJWs way longer than Fantano and H3h3. But he knows how to diversify his humor by making debates with Alt-Righters and vegans and Lilypichu fap streams. THat's why Destiny's YT channel rarely gets demonetized. However, this is a terrible example though and I think that RLM and SBF are better examples.

People like Fantano, H3h3 and Philip DeFranco can make content shitting on SJWs whenever they want. But they have no right to bitch when they get demonetized for making too much of that content. They know that making such content is risky, so why bitch about it?&gt; Just like I can't/won't comment on the people that you mentioned because I've never even heard of them.

I think that says a lot though.

Once you start venturing into more content creators on Youtube, you'll realize how stale the DeFranco/H3h3/Fantano side of Youtube can get with their content.
I started getting through the book but never finished, should probably pick it back up. I think overall the point Bloom is making is pretty valid.

This is just a meme and I'm European so I had to Google what you meant. [It sure looks unfair for corporations.](https://imgur.com/0RQnOq6)Look, as a Muslim let me say this:

Islam already had thousands of reformation attempts, and each attempts led to crazy radical sects and Islamic fundamentalist takeovers of moderate Muslim countries.

There was an Islamic reformation in the 19th century: It led to the birth of Wahhabism. There was an Islamic reformation within The Ottoman Empire: It led to the Armenian Genocide and The Arab Civil Wars of WWI. There was an Islamic reformation in Iran: It led to the Iranian revolution.

Islam doesn't need reformation. MUSLIMS need reformation.There needs to be an economic revolution that favours a strong middle class-based economy in the Muslim world. 

Why don't these fucking Neocons, Liberal Interventionists and Alt-Right shitheads ever get this right?Isn't this the cuck who coward his way out of a debate with Destiny?Can we start calling him "No Everything" instead? Why you using quotes? Can you time stamp that bro?Idk, mostly because it's not a real name? Memeing rn tbh fam'Just because everything is bullshit, doesn't mean that bullshit is everything! Lol ur so dumb dude' &gt;Also what the fuck is the "two side" shit? Not all sides of every issue deserve the same amount of consideration. Asking the question "is rape bad?" and presenting two sides creates a false dichotomy where the two sides are assumed by most to be equal, when they very clearly aren't. It's not that you can't ask the question at all, but the way you go about asking and answering it matters a great deal to how it's going to be interpreted and what conclusions people are going to draw. But as I said the "two sides" shit isn't really the worst thing about these videos, the worst thing is that it's obvious Nazi propaganda.

This.

If the argument was "Is the Earth Flat", should we really listen to the Flat Earthers?I can see a clear correlation here. Unless you can prove it to me of course... S O C I A L  C O N T R A C T to be honest tho, i don't think i can take Eminem's moral grandstanding seriously. In fact I can't take any moral grandstanding by any rapper seriously.I want to see Jordan Peterson debate Margaret Atwood.because it's hard to to take a moral lecture seriously from dudes who make a living singing songs about gangbanging, killing niggas, and screwing bitches and hos.I dunno man, [it's it's not like Eminem has sung about raping and killing the women in his life a million times.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qH9-8TQB4k)&gt;But yeah gj you cracked the case dude Eminem has edgy lyrics. Groundbreaking stuff.

But that's the thing tho. Someone like eminem literally has no ground to stand on to lecture others about saying stupid shit when he's making money singing about murdering his wife and mother.What moving goalposts? I'm merely giving examples about Eminem, the rapper in question. I'm pretty sure people like 50 cent, Dr Dre, Ice Cube, Tupac aren't any different.

Also, I'm loving all the rapfags who got butthurt about me dissing their genre. You guys splerg all over the place when Trump says shit like grab them by the pussy, yet spend money buying albums of songs about beating raping and murdering women.The degeneracy meme is the most cancerous belief ever adopted by /pol/ and The Trumplibans. 

They literally took the same talking points that radical Muslims have against women who don't wear hijabs and then apply to nearly every aspect of modern female society. And their failure to realize the irony of adopting the religious hardline beliefs of their biggest enemies is the most cancerous of them all.﻿

I usually look for discussions and then read the material that's relevant before listening/watching, rather than just reading papers.I haven't heard this episode yet, but I do listen to the podcast so I can kinda guess their foreign policy position, but I think you underestimate how fucked the American Foreign Policy is. 

&gt; My opinion is that it wasn't from deep foreign policy discussions according the conventional wisdom

Before the United States officially engaged in the Vietnam (The French Occupation) they were told by the highest military personnel in the country that:
* 1) They couldn't win the war 
* 2) The North was more determined to unite then actually apply Communist ideals
* 3) The South was full of Viet Minh and that there was no actual reason for the US to intervene. 

&gt; And then Nixon secretly sabotaging peace talks to get elected. Damn Nixon was horrific.

This happened so late in the game. I mean almost of the military already knew the war was over well before Nixon even started running. [I would suggest you watch the latest Ken Burns Documentary Series about this](http://www.pbs.org/kenburns/the-vietnam-war/watch/)

Also, when it comes to modern American Foreign Policy it is even more horrendous then the Vietnam War.

God his face with that stupid MAGA hat is so fucking punchable.

It's the perfect facial description of the death of the "rational skeptic" movement.this is like a 3/10 memejust because a field is "soft" doesn't mean you get to ignore the discussion that has happened in the field and just jump into discussions blind. Also, if your claim is that feminism is doing something wrong, then yeah, you actually have to know what the fuck feminism is about. &gt; tl'dr: A woman's goal is to look fertile, a man's goal is to be be high status

No, we don't have "goals" in the way you describe. Just because natural selection shaped us in this way to succeed in the ancestral environment, in no way does it mean that these are our actual goals. You never seem to defend this teleological assumption you are making. 

&gt;This is why historically men have been in the positions of power. It's not that we are oppressing women, it's that we are more biologically driven to achieve these positions. Women simply dont have this biological drive to achieve high status.

Sure, this type of evolutionary psychology has explanatory power for our behavior

&gt; Now what is result of feminism? I would say the result of feminism has been to increase women's status in society to become equal to men. Why is this destructive? Well for men it's bad because it makes it much harder for us to be high status.

So? You never explained why I should care about being high status other than it is my "goal", a claim you make no effort to defend.

&gt; For women, it's not bad for them to have higher status, it is simply pointless.

If you assume that women have this one goal and it's the only goal they care about, which seems like a silly assumption to make

&gt; If anything it makes it harder for them to find a man they are attracted to (the high a woman's status, the higher her man's status needs to be)

I'd be interested to see a source on this, even if it's not relevant to my main point.

You also make no effort to actually provide any support for what you claim JP's central claim is, that "Rather than striving for equality we should embrace that men and women are different and no amount of nurture can truly override our nature." You simply proceed to describe our behavior but never explain why outside factors would be unable to change it.&gt; Nobody is saying biology 100% decides behaviour/career choices, it just clearly has a significant impact, I don't even think it's more than environment at all. Apparently that's too hard for science deniers to admit though.

actually that's literally what OP says: "we should embrace that men and women are different and no amount of nurture can truly override our nature." 


This is a good video.

This is one of the biggest troubles with the "open exchange of ideas" meme.

It seems like that can only lead to a good result when people are actually thinking critically and interested in figuring out the truth.

However, reason is not at the center of the human heart. Reason if anything acts as a regulator.

If you don't think human behavior should be regulated, then you don't have any use for reason, or any appeal to it. You just need to wear a nice suit to hide the naked barbarism.I didn't see his first comment. 

&gt;  I accept that there are some instances where nurture can easily overpower our nature.

this is not a clarification, he's contradicting himself. 

&gt; no amount of nurture can truly override our nature.

However, I have no intention of claiming that he believes something that he doesn't, I was just going of-of what he actually said in the main post.Iife begins at conception. Jerking off isnt killing life. It's really simple. This makes prevention fine.&gt; Now what makes men attractive? This is a little harder to think about but the answer is simple: His status. Women are attracted to high status men. This can be seen in many ways such as:

* Harvey Weinstein. &gt; doxxed

1) it won't be seen like that by others (let's be honest here, she won't see it that way either)

2) you're not interested in claiming a moral high ground personally but rather want a deterrent

?Probably. But you can gain even more IQ points each time you talk about how cringeworthy Rick and Morty fans are.You mean the skepto-sphere in general.To be honest, there's nothing wrong with liking loli, and I'd even go further and say there's nothing wrong with finding minors sexually attractive.

I don't get this weird obsession, especially in the West, where people deny any sort of sexual attraction to anyone that they perceive to be under 18, which historically seems to be a very recent social invention in the 21st century. It's pretty natural to have sexual attraction to minors, even throughout much of human history, especially ones that have reached puberty. In fact puberty is nature's way of making your body sexually attractive to others.Pretty lucky she's a US citizen, there are some western countries where this shit would come with an uncomfortable amount of legal troubleThat's another thing I don't get; our society doesn't seem to have a problem with ultraviolence in the media, yet even the most harmless of sex scenes are infinitely more taboo. Like, we're literally playing games where your objective is to repeatedly murder people on the opposing team, with blood and guts flying around and bodies ragdolling all over, and that's completely fine and acceptable, yet [Rapelay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RapeLay) gets extreme scruitny and banned from countries. It's almost as if our society has some sort of weird hangup when it comes to sex.nice straw meme arguments thereWhat problem do you have with that statement? Puberty is exactly what I said it is. In fact, if you go to the 'Puberty' article in Wikipedia [it literally says just that:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty)

&gt;Puberty is the process of physical changes through which a **child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction.** It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads: the ovaries in a girl, the testes in a boy. In response to the signals, **the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, bones, muscle, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and sex organs**. Physical growth—height and weight—accelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, **the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys and girls are the external sex organs.**

Try to meme better next time.First off, I said **especially** those who have reached puberty.

Second, your argument is completely irrelevant. Puberty is literally your body transforming into a more sexually appealing form. If that Wikipedia article can't convince you, I don't know what will. Have you ever had puberty? Are you 10?Link to the debate?https://www.twitch.tv/videos/181748789?t=01h22m58sI realize that he has the face of a [theater mask](http://moziru.com/images/mask-clipart-drama-club-15.jpg). Really makes you think.....The Malay Mail is one of the leading English newspapers in Malaysia. They're like a mix of The New Yorker and WSJ (The Edge is the Malaysian equivalent to The WSJ) and they lean center-left on social and cultural issues so it's pretty shocking to see one of their main columnists embracing alt-right memers, especially since their ["Opinions"](http://www.themalaymailonline.com/opinion) section is very progressive to that of Salon and Vox.

Also, this columnist's [FB page follows very Left-Wing causes](https://imgur.com/a/V5jAg) so it makes his fat-shaming and use of Milo quotes even more bizarre.Trump officially saying proclaiming that he's a white nationalist and supports white nationalism?

Look, Trump is obviously a poor president, but lets not go all the way to 11 and accuse people of being white nationalists just because we don't like them.&gt;As a real-estate mogul he lost 2 court cases over being discriminatory against black people

This is literally more than 40 years ago. Back then race-relations in the US environment was completely different than it is now, so even if it's true, I think he can be forgiven for simply being a man of his time. Like, seriously, if you want to talk about huge fucking racists 40 years ago, then look no further than [Muhammad Ali himself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HBnc8YNaaQ). Yet when he died last year, nobody ever said anything about him being a racist. It's almost as if people are a bunch hypocrites with double standards and biases on everything.Oh this is just precious. So to you, Trump is a racist (and still a racist) for something he did 40 years ago, but Muhammad Ali, who was such a fucking racist cunt he even said that ['he doesn't have white friends, only white associates'](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/muhammad-ali-dead-dies-one-regret-malcolm-x-a7066446.html), who [called white people his enemies,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KKCDoUocXk) who [mocked progressives and liberals at the time for trying to bring blacks and whites together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDa-3VkLDMw), apparently he's not racist. Sure man.When you name your video "The Jewish Question" and put spooky music on it, it does comes off a bit anti-semitic.

&gt;who thinks Muslim terrorism is terrible using anecdotal evidence

If you need anecdotal evidence to convince yourself that Muslim terrorism is terrible, then maybe there's a problem with you.Did anyone ever said kicking Muslims out? Most would just settle for a solid integration program. Even Bunty agrees to this. So take your bullshit strawman out of here.

Also, I actually live in one of these Muslim countries, grew up in a Muslim background, and know how their society is like. Muslims don't simply change from being conservative Muslim to being a liberal simply because they immigrated. Most of these people are economic migrants, they're not interested in Western secular liberal ideas. Without proper integration, in most cases they pretty much retained whatever fundamentalist conservative Islamic beliefs that they had before. Except now they're in a Western country and either breed more conservatives or bring more of their families with them who are more or less conservative as them.

Muslim culture is a pretty hard thing to shake off, even for an average Muslim. I find it weird when progressives and liberals seem to assume that as soon as a Muslim steps on Western land and see all the wonders secular democracy, they'll somehow drop an entire lifetime of conservative Islamic cultural upbringing in favor of their new culture. It doesn't happen that way. This analogy doesn't make any sense whatsoever, so cool dude.You mean ONLY in America. That's because the US has a solid, fundamentalist right-wing Christian presence that dissuades negative foreign cultural elements from taking more root. It's not the same everywhere else, especially in Europe, where countries tend to be more liberal and progressive, and more forgiving of negative cultures. 

And even then 2nd generation Muslim immigrants don't really do that well. I'm in the Exmuslim community, and I often hear stories about how exmuslims in the US get discriminated or disowned by their own families and communities simply because they left the religion and open about it. What's frustrating is these stories never seem to get out to mainstream US left-wing media, instead we get shit like Linda Sarsour and Reza Aslan lying to everyone how awesome and progressive Islam and Muslim societies are.1. Name another country that has successfully integrated Muslim immigrants into their society. You could say maybe Canada, but even then it's debatable.

2. No citation needed, this is pretty much common sense since the only underlying factor between America and most of Europe is that America's mostly Christian conservative society does not tolerate Islamic cultures as much as countries in Europe do, or otherwise Muslim immigrants everywhere in every country would integrate just as well. But that's not the case, especially in European countries like Germany or Sweden, because unlike the US, because their society is more accepting and forgiving of foreign negative cultures.

&gt;I'm in 5 communities. 3 are Muslim and 2 are ex-Muslims and you're wrong.

citation needed&gt;This is my point you offer no solutions.

I literally said in my post about a solid integration program, but apparently you're illiterate.

&gt;You haven't considered that maybe shit talking them constantly is detrimental if anything and that is why people don't do it constantly.

Yeah, because coddling Muslim immigrants has been doing really great for their integration in Germany, Sweden, France, UK, and other European countries so far. 

Also, apparently 'talking shit' about white supremacists is going to dissuade white supremacists, but somehow it's not going to dissuade conservative Muslims. Weird how your logic works.

&gt;My personal experience is that Muslims coming here are liberal so I guess that makes it so then huh?

Sure dude.Speaking of Mindhunter it seems to me that the anti-SJW/Alt-Lite crowd used the same sociopathic methods that Ed Kemper used: Faking empathy, emphasized on sob stories, agreeing a point and then disagreeing after turning their backs, etc. These traits are common in Martin Shkreli and Milo Minneapolis.

We need a psychological research study on the "rational skeptic" crowd.&gt;Where is the solution in constantly shitting on Islam?

Aah I see you're a Muslim. Explains why you're strongly against criticizing a backwards religion like Islam.

&gt; It isn't my fault you are too stupid to realize most of the terrorists 

The problem isn't just terrorists. In fact terrorism is the LEAST of the problems within a Muslim community. The bigger problem is the prevalence of fundamentalist conservative Islamic cultures that goes against the spirit of secular liberal humanism in these countries yet are prevalent in most of the Muslim communities.

&gt;I'm glad you realize why you are a fucktard for going off your personal experience as fact.

Sure dude.It's ridiculous, because he assumes that I'm some right-wing Christfag who despises Islam yet loves and defend Christianity, when in reality I'm just an exmuslim atheist with anti-theist beleifs and hates Christianity more or less the same. Not to mention it's just another form of [Whattaboutism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism).

&gt;How about instead you tell us what you think the average muslim thinks about minorities and race relations, and clarify whether this is something you think is universally true, something that's anecdotal, or something you can back up somehow. 

The best thing that I have in the form of actual statistics are [these statistics from Pew Research](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/), which I find absolutely reasonable and reflects my own experience living and growing up in a Muslim background, yet according to Steben these statistics don't count because flawed data collection or some dumb apologist bullshit.No, I assume he directed the analogy in an attempt to attack what he assumes to be my religion, when in reality I don't give a shit about Christianity either; Islam and Christianity can go to hell for all I care. Which is why I said his analogy doesn't make sense.

Well fuck you too.&gt;I can tell you first hand that Muslim here integrate super well, especially the Arab and South Asian ones. In addition to that, there have been exactly two people who have died as a direct result of Islamic Terrorism.

The problem isn't just terroristm. In fact terrorism is the LEAST of the problems within a Muslim community. The bigger problem is the prevalence of fundamentalist conservative Islamic cultures that goes against the spirit of secular liberal humanism in these countries yet are prevalent in most of the Muslim communities.

I don't think this is acceptable. Not this alone, without him accepting responsibility for the damage he has done.

From my perspective, It doesn't really matter if he is racist on the inside, in his heart of hearts or not, or what sort of moral journey he is on. Same thing with PewDiePie.

Sure it might matter as a personal, or human interest story, but as a practical matter it has no relevance.

Like imagine he backed his car over your mailbox, or broke a window with a baseball. I guess it matters a little bit if he did it maliciously or not, but don't come to me about how you had some moral epiphany about the broken window and expect me to completely forget about it. You owe me a window.

There was still damage done, and he is still responsible. Does a court of law accept moral introspection instead of payment of damage?

All he is doing here is trying to demonstrate that he has some modicum of morality and civility. But that civility is just the platform through which he might be able to take responsibility for what he did. I'm not convinced that I have seen that.

If he pretends to this morality and civility but then doesn't take responsibility, it's no better than a ruse. He either takes responsibility and admits he was making propaganda, or he is still a snake.The "JQ" videos need to come down. Then maybe a series on anti-Semitism. As a so called "skeptic" there is a lot there to be debunked. If he does that properly that would help.

He would need to do some research to actually do a well informed video about it though, and given the information he has presented so far I don't really have much trust in his research methodology.

That's what I would want to see though, something that would really outline the damage of anti-Semitism. In some cases historically it's been damaging to Jews, but the main thing anti-Semitism damages is the anti-Semites. Maybe talk about power dynamics in medieval Europe, and why the Nobles would be motivated both to give power to Jewish tax collectors and bankers instead of their own subjects.

It's sort of similar to the reason why minority governments were propped up by the British in Syria and Iraq. A minority government will always be precarious, just as the position of a Jewish tax collector is precarious. Unable to challenge the crown, or the empire.

The anti-Semitism of the common people against the kings tax collectors is a tool by which the common people are manipulated by the king, who would rather not see any rival noble houses arise to challenge his own.

Some realistic and informative perspective on anti-Semitism would help take the edge off a bit I think, which seems to be what he wants as far as I can tell. He would need to work pretty hard to escape the echo chamber he has fallen into though, and get some perspective.https://i.imgur.com/YIGtH2k.jpgyou streaming south park is really so fittingall is as it should beI think I know who got destroyed in this debate.[](/SWEATSTINY)*Him*? The officer was clearly a woman and therefore only slightly taller and more muscular than Steven.Fuck Dave Rubin. I want Destiny to debate The Golden One because of high meme potential.redoing the first mission 100 times, never forgetNot sure what level of *noob* I am on the piano but one of the small things that I learned from my keyboard with LED lights is that it seemed like preparing your hand movements was important.

Like you had the option to play three keys from your pinky your long finger it might be more optimal to take the versatile option by transitioning on the last key to the index finger or thumb depending on where you needed to play next. 

What might seem like the easier route at the moment – to "Q, W, E" with your pinky, ring and long finger – will also lock your movements for all other situations that might arise if you don't transition into R.

Steven might be right if you only had 4 binds on your keyboard but there are way more.



Flash on D or F is irrelevant. It's just the two natural binds, depending on if you use the 3 or 4-finger position for QWER. That's DOTA though; [LOL is a pleb game and you only need 4 keys.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CthtqOdBd0g&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=183)I am fairly certain that they are both not Nazis.

With Nazis (if not actually Nazis at least overtly antisemitic people using Nazi terminology) popping up all over, I appreciate that.I think you misunderstood.

I said I'm certain he isn't a Nazi. I was trying to say like I appreciate that, as opposed to the Mouthy Buddha type stuff I have been seeing recently.

I think Peterson is pretty much fine.

I just call it like I see it and recently I'm seeing lots of Nazis. Not Peterson though, that was my whole point.Are you some kind of left-handed pleb? We are talking left-hand placement. You tried hard but I think it's time you surrender. I will accept a payment of one meme for peace. Are they all named Tom and Ruckus? So why don't they just email them?  Accepted. Well, I think what I said is fair. I don't have a very broad definition of Nazis.

To me a Nazi is somebody who has an ethnic understanding of society, whereby some special people represent the body and some less special people represent disease in that body.

It's pretty much a strait line from that kind of ideology to genocide, and there isn't really any where else it can go.

Using Nazi terminology, making a video about how great and patriotic Hitler was, how troublesome minority groups are, like these are well inside my definition. I agree there to some you can find a technicality to differentiate Mouthy Buddha from people that self identify as Nazis, but for me practically speaking I have no real compelling reason to get involved in speculating about his self-perception.

To me the people involved might as well be black boxes, and a real Nazi and somebody making videos to further their cause seem don't give me a practical way to differentiate them without getting into personal details I need not be concerned with.

If I knew the people involved personally I would be more interested in the personal story of the different people involved here. But my label "Nazi" that practically speaking is not a label on their soul, it's a label on their cultural vector. I think that video probably has more of an impact than going to a rally and waving a banner, so from that perspective Mouthy Buddha is more of a Nazi than most self identifying Nazis.

That is the practical perspective that people should be concerned with.

Perhaps you would prefer the labels like that to be reserved for different regions of political thought, but I am labeling the vectors by according to where it seems to me they are headed, and I see the entire skeptic community basically rallying around a video headed right to Nazi town.

What I really appreciate is that I think Petersons ideas are orthogonal to Nazi propaganda in many important ways.

I don't think all the suffering that trans-community experience is his fault. I think some people just have easier lives than others.

I never got the impression that Jordan Peterson was maliciously misgendering people in spite of their queerness, and I don't think pinning all the suffering of the queer people on him makes sense.

Basically my perspective is this. I think that the closer you stick to social norms and standards, the easier your life is going to be. Personally I don't really do that myself, and that has given my lots of experiences I never would have had otherwise, both positive and negative.

Like there sort of exists a beaten path, and some people are compelled to take a different route. It's basically like playing a higher skillcap hero. More things you can do, more mistakes you can make.

As a choice to make for your life, I think it's inherently value neutral. For some it's a choice to do this. If Jordan Peterson was the monster it seems people think, you might expect that he believes taking your life in this direction is always a choice, and queer and trans people chose that, so their suffering is their fault.

That's not what he believes. I've heard him talk about it. Maybe some people choose is eschew convention but most people it's just an expression of who they really are.

Like I think he is making a lot of sense here.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw

Basically I am conflating queerness and creativity, so maybe that is where we disagree, but if that is some insult I don't understand why because that is my empathic bridge to queer people. That is what I have found in my life that is analogous to their experience if not homologous.

But, I think suffering is part of that experience. When I see mobs of people yelling at him, I can help but feel like they are upset because the world never lined up for them. They never fit the right mold, and nothing was ever easy, and it's painful. I think that because that is how I feel.

But I just don't think getting some token concession from him is going to fix it. I think they should not focus on beating down the door of a dull conservative world, because for some people that is a road to nowhere anyway.

I think not fitting in is like tragic and also beautiful, but the tragedy of it isn't Jordan Petersons fault.On the Nazi souls issue, basically what I was saying is that is what I don't want to get in to what that is. I don't think it's worth discussing what that would really mean, if anything.

Aside from that we seem to just be at odds stylistically.

That video speaks to me, and I think he is demonstrating credibility on the subject by elaborating on it. It seems to me like he is coming from a place of empathy for his patients and is intimately familiar with the challenges they face.

If you just present the fact of the matter in two sentences, it's communicating knowledge, but giving a sense of the experience and the emotions that accompany it, I think that is communicating wisdom.

I don't how you concluded that I am saying "decadence" so to speak is turning against that natural order. What I am saying is that it's a more creative way to live, with more pitfalls but possibly more promise.

The only reason it seems to me that you would conclude that is if you think risk is against the natural order, or you think I claimed that. What is unnatural about takings risks?

Even just saying "natural order" is sort of supposing a moral value to that order.

Maybe you have a moral value on order, so you think I am devaluing decadent people by suggesting they are less orderly, but that is something you are projecting on to me. I may be suggesting they are less orderly, but for me this is not a moral judgment. I don't think order is morally superior to disorder.

If anything my bias is to value things that are decadent, or weird more than things that are ordinary. If you lack this bias, I think you are sort of missing the point of that video because you are not the intended audience.

For me, it's a reality check that I cannot just indulge in spiraling off into my own creative projects and must at some point deal with a reality that are more orderly than I would prefer.

As for pinning all of it on him, I was being a bit hyperbolic. It's clearly not pinned all on him specifically. But I do get the sense that social norms and structures are blamed for things like trans suicide, and he has sort of become the token representation of those social norms and structures.

I have been grieving recently the suicide of a music producer that was massively influential to me. I truly envied him, and what he could do.

This song I think is one of the most beautiful songs I have heard. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQluliy3iTg

I wish things were different, I wish that the world was more able to appreciate music producers, and has some structure in place to reward that kind of excellence, instead of consigning them a soul crushing mill of marketing and difficultly where the most obnoxious content wins out.

But the truth is, even if I could find someone to blame, and get in their face and effect some change like that, the truth is I don't even think that is actually why musicians commit suicide.

I think the drive to create something like that just hurts, and the more beautiful the thing, the more it must have hurt them. Apex made many very beautiful things for as long as he could, and i think it's both tragic and beautiful.

It's easy to blame the structure of society, but if the source of the pain is actually existential angst, you can mash down whatever vestige of society you think is problematic and you won't ever reach a solution.

If you want to see some examples of how much worse my music is than Apex's:

That being said, IDK about how objective Exkillsmeh was regarding the values for prior and posterior probabilities, but he was correct that he adjustments for the prior probability wouldn't effect the outcome much and I'm pretty sure Destiny agrees with the values used for the other probabilities.

e: Funny to see people downvoting this and my other comments because they don't know about basic stats.It's taught to 16 year olds in the UK, and some of the basics regarding it are also now being taught to some from ages 14-15. It's also quite important in science, Veritasium did a good video regarding it: https://youtu.be/R13BD8qKeTgFor the prior probability, yes, you make that up yourself and is generally a realistic guess. The video I linked discusses it here: https://youtu.be/R13BD8qKeTg?t=109

This value isn't very important (although Destiny tried to argue that it was, without ever hearing about it before) because changing this value doesn't have a major affect on the outcome if you look at the formula. If I remember correctly, Exskillsmeh even tried a range of different values and let Destiny decide on some of those values, and he showed that even then the outcome wasn't favourable for Destiny.

Ps: I don't care about either side here, I just think that a lot of people talking shit about Exkillsmeh don't know what they're talking about either. I don't know about all his claims, but the stuff he did regarding Bayes Theorem seemed consistent.Well most of statistics isn't really objective because we as people have to make decision with our values and there is always some uncertainty in them. That being said, statistics and Bayes theorem are definitely not retarded and the theorem is extremely useful.

Whether you have an issue with the prior probability doesn't matter because like I said, Destiny agreed that values used seemed good to him. Bayes theorem is used for literally all sorts of stats tasks even in political science, such as predicting who will win certain votes in different areas or even a general election.

IDK how this stats stuff even started, but why did Destiny even accept (by arguing about it) that this is something that could even be predicting accurately using stats? Further more, why would he argue about it if he doesn't know about it if all he has done is a basic introduction to stats which was so basic it didn't cover Bayes theorem.

Personally I don't think it's worth trying to come up with a definitive number and instead people should just examine hard evidence to support their claims.&gt; Maybe it's not true (depends on our terms), but I've had my car for 4 years now, it's never broken down. Bayesian analysis (in this way) would tell me my car will never break down.

Just no. I won't get into because it's not worth either of ours time to get this information, but unless you decided the prior probability should be 0 (which is ridiculous), then Bayes theorem wouldn't predict that the car wouldn't break down.

&gt;Doesn't matter that takes awhile to start, the engine light is on, and it's been years since it's been serviced. 

Yes it does matter, and these are some things to consider when coming up with your prior.

Out of interest, if Destiny was fine with all the numbers used including the prior, then what's the problem with the stats? Maybe Destiny should've just not discussed it in the first place since he knew nothing about it and if he did want to continue to consider using stats, he should've done further research on the numbers used by exskillsme and Bayes theorem.

If you have the video where they discussed this I would be really interested to watch it again because it's been a while and I don't want my recollection of it to be off.&gt; You're tested positive for a disease that 1 in 100 have, the test has a 99% accuracy, so you have a 9% chance of having it. Using the Bayesian analysis, you go to a second doctor and get a second test, and using the posterior of 9% from the last test, the second test also comes back positive giving you a now 91% probability. What part of this is subjective?

The point of going to an entirely different doctor is because you don't necessarily believe the first doctor and want another doctor to do the test because they may have different skills or methods or whatever. In the example, doctors don't just say Positive/Negative, they a give a probability for Positive, which is something that each doctor would give different values for. 

Scientists decide on an uncertainty and from your view it would seem that you would consider these values as being too arbitrary and therefore subjective. Which they sort of are, but it doesn't matter either because the results are still practically the same. I don't think it's either subjective or objective, I think it's more of a spectrum. I would say doctors are more on the objective side than Exskillsmeh. 

EDIT:

&gt;You have to use your subjective intuition and deductive reasoning, which is heavily steeped in bias for everyone.

Yup, but just as a scientist uses their subjective intuition and deductive reasoning to decide on an uncertainty for their testing, you can do the same here. The reason we don't have an issue with the scientists doing it is because we believe that they were being more objective than most and used good deductive reasoning to come to these decisions (which they of course do). Similar thing is happening with exskillsmeh because Destiny was agreeing with the values being used.Fair enough. But if the machine would always give the same result then there isn't much point in getting a second opinion. Key word there is opinion, because there is a degree of subjectivity in it. (But it's from professional doctors so they will generally all be quite accurate and consistent.)Yup, and that's what Destiny should've said and discussed instead of having people argue about the numbers and complain about how exskillsmeh came up with them. Like I said, I wouldn't even bother arguing about these numbers. I would prefer to discuss actual evidence.Top strat is to roll your eyes whenever Peterson mentions that all his points can be found in the Bible, if you interpret it correctly.If Destiny is guilty of all the accusations he's banned me for making then we are dealing with one truly sick fuck.

Was Destiny playing Leauge or something last night, there was a post saying he did, but I couldn't find itCalling Philip DeFranco a journalist is an insult to journalism.

The fact that people sucked DeFranco and Ethan Klein's dicks for going after Casey Neistat for endorsing Hillary Clinton while actual good journalists like Jenan Moussa are ignored makes me sick to my stomach.
&gt;Who's calling defranco a journalist? He even explicitly stated he isn't a journalist

[Then why does he triggered when The Verge calls him a gossip vlogger? (Which is what he does though)](https://twitter.com/phillyd/status/872480352727515136?lang=en)

&gt;As for Defranco calling out Casey. If you watched the video he specifically calls out the part where casey says to call out youtubers to support hillary clinton. He never criticizes the fact that he endorsed Hillary, but the fact that he tells people to call out youtubers.

Is that wrong? People have been doing that for thousands of years. It's called advocacy. Casey Neistat has the right to call out people to support Hillary Clinton.&gt;And he is in no way a gossip vlogger if you think he is in the likes of keemstar and scarce you haven't watched many of his videos.

But he is literally Hi-Quality Keemstar though. On his about channel, he says that [A 5 day a week, daily show where I talk about the news and pop culture that matters to me and should matter to you.](https://www.youtube.com/user/sxephil/videos). But the way [he frames his Thumbnails ](https://imgur.com/a/BAUt3) makes him on the Keemstar standard. Also, "should matter to me"? I really don't give a fuck about iDubbbz and RiceGum and yet DeFranco reports on it as if it's more important than the Syrian Civil War.

You know what channel does "news talk" better than DeFranco? [Caspian Report](https://www.youtube.com/user/CaspianReport/videos?disable_polymer=1). [Their thumbnails are so unclickbaity](https://imgur.com/a/6OC8y) but they've managed to do everything that an independent news channel should do. Hell, eventhough they're based in Azerbaijan, they get commended by Armenians for their [amazing coverage of The Armenian Genocide and The Nagorno Karabakh War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lWrGub9-_0). I doubt that DeFranco can even tackle the same topic with nuance.
&gt; Defranco says he doesn't agree with that part as it sent hate to many youtubers who are not even involved with politics.

Has anyone actually done that? If no, then it's as much bullshit as those "C-16 will imprison you for misgendering trans people" memes. DeFranco literally pulled a Jordan Peterson on DeFranco which is even more disingenous and disgusting than Casey Neistat calling out people to support Hillary Clinton.

BONUS MEME: For some reason, Casey Neistat has ignored JonTron's controversy eventhough it was covered by TIME Magazine. So much for "news you should matter".Yeah,  Saul Alinsky is so dishonest....&gt; Well the answer to that is Yes. Many youtubers were getting messages and comments asking them if they support hillary after casey's video and what they thought about the video. It was all over twitter at the time.

Sources please. I've yet to see it in the news that a major Youtuber was harassing people in support of Hillary. 

And yeah, people were asking whether or not they support Hillary even before the Casey Neistat video. It is completely legal to go to someone and ask "do you support Hillary for President?". I doubt anyone was going full triggered and saying "BITCH HOW FUCKING DARE YOU NOT SUPPORT HILLARY! YOU'RE A RACIST TRUMP SUPPORTER" at anyone. That is considered harassment and I've yet to see any lawsuits for that.

&gt;Yet in Casey's case he EXPLICITLY tells people to call out youtubers directing people.

And like I've said: IT IS COMPLETELY LEGAL TO DO THAT! It's called advocacy. It's literally no different from "I WANT YOU to support the Army" or "You're With Us or You're Against Us". Yes, they're bad but they're not harassment as what DeFranco, Ethan Klein and Idubbbz were claimed.Just because they say it doesn't mean it's true. 

And if that's the case,  they should be filing lawsuits against Casey for organised harassment. 

Seriously the attacks against Casey Neistat makes no sense since he's doing what every famous celebrity would do for politics. But because he's a youtuber and not Sean Penn,  he gets attacked for going against the grain of YouTube's current environment that favors anti-SJW content you dawg. What stream are we talking about?&gt; Holy shit. You just are too stubborn to concede this point that multiple youtubers came out after the video. If you were around during the time of the video you could have witnessed all the people talking about it.

You've just pointed out an anecdote not backed up by facts and data. Please don't pull a Sargon on me.

&gt;The problem people have with the casey video was that he was directly calling his audience to call out youtubers who haven't come out supporting hillary clinton. 

It's not illegal though and like I've said: It's basic advocacy and is used for 1000 years of democratic history.

&gt;One of defranco's point is why should youtubers have to tell their audience who should vote for. Why should smosh come out and make a political statement that would be divisive.

Because Youtubers, like movie stars and singers are public figures and thus they have the right to promote the things they like? If they can endorse Squarespace, they also have the right to endorse a political candidate.

&gt;If pewdiepie made a video telling his millions of fans "Go message all the youtubers who you watch and ask them XYZ" I am pretty sure you and many people would have a problem with him directing his entire audience on a bunch of youtubers.

Youtubers have been doing that ever since Youtube started. Remember Kony 2012? Remember #GetCovered? It's normal. It's only controversial because H3h3 and DeFranco wanted them Sargonbucks.

Philip DeFranco is literally doing the same shit that conservatives did against the Dixie Chicks when they called out against the Iraq War and fought against the pro-Bush country music environment.I have been aware of her a little longer than I knew anything about Destiny and she is one wacky gal lemme tell you.

Can you respond to my comment? Celebrities such as yourself never respond to my AMA questions. (Don't leave me hanging like I know you're planning on doing)The ORIGINAL sceptic.Late, but I pretty much agree with this. I support Phil on Patreon and I'm on this subreddit like every day but I think a conversation between the two would just be strange and probably not great. 

I feel like they both lean sorta left but Phil's main priority is always news and presenting information - and although he likes "conversation", I doubt he does any real thinking about political theory (idk if that's the right term) or philosophy or argumentation. He feels more like an average, reasonable dude who tries to stay unbiased as much as he can about what's going on, despite his emotional reactions to things.

Destiny, though also not an expert by any stretch, cares more about policy and political positions and at least seems to openly think about philosophy and specific political issues. Sort of a "what/how should I think" vs. a "what happened" difference.

 I don't think Phil's hesitation to commit is really in the "feels argument" zone but I can definitely see how people in the Destiny sphere would consider him irrational at times. I get the sense that although Phil has changed his mind about issues in the past, he treats the "conversation" more as a sampler of viewpoints than a contest of ideas in which one is the most rational. In the end I don't know what they'd talk about. Phil seems to like Dave Rubin and Ben Shapiro (and Destiny doesn't really) but those aren't the worst people. Phil seems to resist "SJWs" and the label of "feminism" but I don't think he outright has a problem with them. He probably has some of the milder right-wing views won't go to war for them. They probably agree on most major issues like Trump, immigration, LGBTQ rights, although Destiny probably could defend his points better in an argument. Idek how much Phil would like Destiny as a person.

I wouldn't be surprised if Phil had seen the JonTron debate thoBecause you save those miles for another trip where using your car would be more worthwhile for you, instead of just for a long ass trip.

Either way it doesn't matter because you took your car and probably enjoyed using more so than if you rented a shittier car (or wasted money on a more expensive car), and that's what it's all about boi.I really can't even think of what the last "attacking SJWs" thing Phil did was, and I watch him daily. He seems to only cover it if it's news. Now that I think about it Phil is probably a good model for what Destiny wishes centrists/skeptics were.&gt; fucking retarded chimpanzee by the name of "Steven Bonnell" 

The second 😠😠😠

He's part of a trilogyYeah I agree. In regards to the Milo videos, his main stance is that "silencing someone makes them stronger" which is in a sense true. Idk if he decries any of the silencing as the death of freedom tho, I never really got that impression but even then that's definitely one of the milder right-wing talking points and he certainly doesn't make out SJWs or culture memess out to be a bigger issue than Trump.SourceFed is definitely not the same thing as the Philip DeFranco show. As for the journalism thing, I'm pretty sure he doesn't claim to be one, just someone who presents the stories, although it seems like he's reaching higher with his newer venture. I personally watch him because it seems like he's pretty good at curating the different sides of important stories without a political agenda (minus the occasional anti-MSM stuff). His style might not be your thing but I don't think he's bad at what he specifically does.

I feel like hating Phil for not being a journalist is somewhat akin to hating Destiny for not being a political scientist or something. I'm sure Destiny has respect for some political scientists and cites their ideas but that's not really what he does on his show - even if some people probably get a lot of their political ideas from only Destiny

edit: clarity and rephrasing of some potentially incorrect statementsCongrats, you're a reactionary. &gt; Probably doesn't matter to Destiny but still.

I said that because I know you don't use the car much anyways and that the cost of the wear to the car doesn't matter because of that.

&gt;Either way it doesn't matter because you took your car and probably enjoyed using more so than if you rented a shittier car...

Literally all for you using the car however you want. Good for you man.

^(My comments are more towards others who are paying for their own car and want to use it for things like commuting for as long as possible.)

I understand you can get easily agitated due to the fuck ton of trolls you converse with everyday but sheesh.I got this the first time he talked with Destiny as well, he seemed to agree with Destiny's points then on twitter defended Mouthy Buddha again. He just says literally whatever he thinks they want to hear, he really is spineless. So let me guess, you also want refugees in America too then?

If I go through your post history I will find you advocating for lots more refugees in Europe and America too?

You are just selflessly motivated to post this for their benefit, how outstanding.Oh, sorry. You were conflating Jewish people in general with the specific policies of one government, so I thought you where a right wing nutcase.Overwhelmingly?

https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/u-s-election-2016/1.752212

Please explain the error of these polls to me then.its so clear to me that his whole schtick is just to "criticize" the alt-right in a literal word-by-word sense, but in actuality he believes in just about every position he argues about. He is not that smart, and it is really evident in his earlier not-so-polished videos. However, everyone in the skeptic community seems stuck on stupidYou are so fucking full of shit dude.

I am calling you out for conflating Jewish people with Israeli policy, and this is how you validate that?

This is what overwhelming support looks like to you? This result is not that far off from what I linked, and both show pretty clearly the opposite of what you claim.

Constraining the discussion to just orthodox Jews is meaningless and arbitrary, and even after manipulating the available information with these sorts of arbitrary parameters it's still not even close to "overwhelming".

Accept that fact that you are not being reasonable and think about why.It's making me sad that I need to break this down for you.

It's difficult for me to believe that you actually don't see what my issue with you is here, and it seems like you are being intentionally disingenuous now.

However, it's possible that you are just emotionally invested and honestly having trouble, so I'm going to put in a little bit more effort, for your behalf.

I said you were "You were conflating Jewish people in general with the specific policies of one government".

You said "Well, Donald Trump had overwhelming support amongst Orthodox US jews, so."

So what? You were trying to use this information to suggest that Jews in general support nationalistic rhetoric and policies, and for that reason your earlier conflation was valid.

However, never before this post was anything you said qualified by "orthodox". Even among religious Jews, orthodox is the smallest denomination. If you are talking about ethnicity, which most racists usually are, the proportion is even smaller.

So, you were first talking about the whole pie, then you picked a very very small slice of the pie to support your claim about the whole pie.

This is my issue. It's amusing that you say, "stop attacking a straw man" because my problem with you here is that you that constructed such an absurd representation of Jewish people in general to begin with.

The thing about "overwhelming support" was also wrong, and that is also a problem, but given where we originally started and what we were originally talking about, it's a secondary problem.
You were not saying anything about "diverse opinions".

You were suggesting that because Israel is acting a particular way that is equivalent to a "Jew problem".

That kind of rhetoric is a clearer example of anti-Semitism on the left than I have ever seen before.

From my perspective, anti-Semitism on the left is one of the biggest obstacles to peace, because war hawkish Israeli nationalists take one look at language like that and feel completely validated.

That isn't my position and I think it's tragically shortsighted, but people like you put me in a very difficult position if I want to try to convince anyone. Ok buddy. Enjoy your life.&gt;DSP broken up with his GF

&gt;Destiny broken up with his GF

[Are you guys thinking what I'm thinking?](http://i.imgur.com/NZWck5a.png)Don't worry blesstiny, we're here for youSo basically being charitable with your interpretation of their claims? This is something Destiny pretty much always does in his debates whereas a lot of the people he argues with don't do, yet they say he still is misrepresenting him. (Which if they can back up then fair enough)

It's funny because those same people are now going to try this "steelman" approach on the JQ, a topic which is hard to "steelman" without coming across as propaganda (as we've seen with Mouthy) when they never previously did it with SJW bullshit.&gt; How do these people get so lost?

memes.

As a few of the people Destiny has discussed with recently have said, the reason the """sceptics""" aren't sceptical of both sides is because they memes of one side are more enjoyable for them.&gt; That is a very "white nationalist" or even "white supremacist" idea.

Can you expand on this more? In particular I would find it hard to believe that any people in any country would either WANT or be indifferent to becoming a minority. Because of this I also don't think this idea is particular to white nationalists and is something that other groups would believe.

I've watched Destiny's debate with JonTron so I know what Destiny's arguments are and I generally I agree with that he said and I understand that there is nothing inherently wrong with being a minority (assuming the majority are not harsh and that the society is fair and equal to all members. Also there are examples of successful minorities so that's not an issue either.)

Although it's something Destiny and I assume you also dismiss, I think people can not want to be a minority and also not be racist.If the majority of people on both sides would prefer not to be the minority, then even if it's a deep (somewhat "soft") racist feeling, is it really a major issue? I personally think not, but I do think that the effort that may be required to not become the minority could result in certain discrimination which would be a more "hard" form of racism.

Personally I don't see it as much of an issue, but I find it worrying that people who public state this belief are labelled as in such a negative way even if most people feel the same way. (Although I would agree that a lot of the people who are public about this belief and really stand by it generally are very racist/xenophobic.)Fair enough, I see what you mean.wtf im redpilled now?Hey man, I hope everything works out for you buddy. Do what you gotta do, you know we all support you. Love you man. Wow it's been well over a year since you last did this right? Prizes seem cool too. IDK anything about music so I'm not gonna bother.

BTW you should probably include the submission deadline and some other information like what exactly you mean by 'fleshing out' your idea (although it can be inferred by the previous challenges.)

Good luck to those of you who try out this challenge.Or that girl from /pol/[This creature has the nerve to call someone 'The Retard' and 'Down with the Syndrome'](https://i.imgur.com/YAQMY0S.png)IDK why you even bother highlighting that. If anyone watches his talks with Destiny and comes off with the impression that No Bullshit wasn't a complete spazmoid, then they probably have problems.Ah 30 seconds in and it's as good as I remember it to be.Yeah he does. It's still fun to watch because of how similar it is to NoBullshit, but that NoBS is actually legit in the way he thinks. In particular if you look at the incest stuff.Can someone link the parts of MB's JQ videos where he shows the opposing side? I keep seeing the same clip which looks bad, but I want to see how he portrays the other side since I've been told that's the whole point of his series.Hmm if I have time I may watch to see if begins presenting the side as that title card suggests he would do. But from the sounds of it, he doesn't ever get to that.If most the people are poor then who will pay the Zakats? Also sounds like all your asking for is wealth redistribution, which is someone that a lot of people around the world want including in the US, but it's clearly hard af to achieve.&gt;Destiny is a beta cuck. Play with JonTron and you'll see why.

Did one of you guys write this?Sonic is not an anime 😠&gt; many Muslims prefer an Islamic society with its economic system and are skeptical of democracy.

IDK about this especially considering the ideas you've put forward so far. Most Muslims don't receive much if any Zakat since it's specific to help those who need it. It's similar to social welfare programs and for that reason I don't see how this makes them "skeptical of democracy".

What you're advocating is literally just social programs to be implemented in the ME isn't it? Also something a bit pedantic, but aren't you more referred to the ME/Arab countries, not necessarily all Muslim countries. May be worth making the distinction, because I don't think grouping all Islamic society as one is reasonable considering the differences between some of their economies and less so, their cultures.WOW dude! How many debates did you have to win to get all the parts?Interesting stuff my dude. Hopefully some advancement on this stuff can happen, but to the rest of the world it would seem like military intervention is much more important than economic because ISIS is something easier to get people rallied against. 

I would be inclined to agree with you considering that even in the capital of Iraq people don't have electricity for the whole day or in Syria where you have whole cities demolished, it would seem like the benefits of an economic intervention can only start after basic infrastructure is built. But then again, this can't even start in some places because of constant terror threats which target this kind of infrastructure.

Your method of implementing this does seem a bit risky though by supporting dictatorships.-3/10 memeNo it means your a septic.Never too late to stop calling people autistic as an insulta torrent of all of destiny's musicDo you think the recent arrest of Manafort and others associated with Trump will eventually lead to his impeachment?so enlightenedThanks, it gave me a chuckle or two. What's more plausible. A group that has been historically discriminated against and targeted have on average lower iq's because they have gotten the short end of the stick, socioeconomically...

 Naw, they must be genetically inferior. we also have the problem of induction: the only way to show that induction works is by induction and the new riddle of induction: we don't know when induction is working and when it's not.[tfw you fail to comprehend a simple 4 minute video](https://i.imgur.com/Znw5fRb.png)this has nothing to do with the comment. The point was that the discrimination, if it exists, is not at the admission level. So, changing how much information is available to the university, would not address the problem, if there is one. If the person does have a "different opinion" then they are disagreeing with the actual data from the study that shows that there isn't discrimination in the admission process and claiming that there is discrimination and proposing a solution. If this is case, they are doing a terrible job of conveying that. Otherwise, their solution ignores the point of the video and solves nothing.that's the big problem with arguing with people on twitter about shit like this. You basically get sucked into defending something you can't (there's literally no differences between men and women) because admitting that there are differences is just the end of the conversation for some people, that's where the actual real discussion should start.Because, like I explained, the video argues that the admission process is not where the problem is.

Let's say you have a hotel. You are wondering why people aren't coming into your hotel. You suspect that maybe it's because there's something wrong with your door. You get an audit and it turns out that there isn't anything wrong with your door, there's something else that's causing people to not come in. If your response is "how about I get this very nice expensive door that will work great!, I will say that you have either misunderstood, didn't read the audit or don't believe the audit but failed to express that information.I don't really understand what this has to do with my point. If you want to attack the claims the video makes, go ahead. I have no interest in defending it, though, so you might want to talk to someone else. The positive claims the video is making about discrimination elsewhere is irrelevant to my point. My point is the youtube comment is offering a solution to a problem that is not actually there.I agree. Could you elaborate on how this contradicts what I'm saying?There are two cases:

1) There is no discrimination in the admission process but there is discrimination outside of it. Changing the admission process in this case does nothing.

2) There is no discrimination in the admission process, there is also no discrimination outside of it. We just happen to like different things (I'm oversimplifying because this is not the core of my point). Changing the admission process, in this case, does nothing (because there's no problem to solve)

I really don't understand how much more clear with my point i can be. There is, of course, the third case of disputing the data in the study, which i mentioned before.No worries. It's not really surprising that they disabled youtube comments, they were always going to be a shitshow.except the youtube comment literally starts with "solution:" which is implying that it's solving a problem. I guess you can then claim that the problem the comment is talking about is actually the problem of misperception but then I'm not sure how that's relevant to the video since that's not really what the video is addressing. But then again, this doesn't actually do anything for the perception of discrimination outside of the admission process, so the ideology you are so worried about can remain intact. Affirmative action doesn't have to rely on the implication of discrimination in the admission process.[Why? I don't know](https://i.imgur.com/R9Edhpt.png)reddit threads are a bit different, at least in theory. The locking is there to stop other subreddits from brigading the comments, i guess.

I think different regions have completely different definitions of it.

From an east coast perceptive, it goes:

East coast is east of Appalachian Mountains 

Appalachians is West Virginia and change, not really many people here so not mentioned much.

MidWest is Ohio to Mississippi River.
 
West is Mississippi river to the Rockies

Rockies might be it's own thing, maybe part of West. Again not that many people up in the mountains so not mentioned that much.

West Coast is after Rockies.low hanging fruit, this is pretty much a slight ad hominem because rather then engaging in blesstiny's arguments he just dismisses them at face value.how do i buy bitcoin in thisYou have a lot to learn /u/AutoDidact23 , A LOT. You need to be more humble with your approach in certain topics that go beyond shallow topics of current events and politics (easy picks, unless you don't mind looking like a complete imbecile, which I know you care, given the recent ego-trip you have been in). Just a reminder that you have spent the good part of your life barely surviving, fighting not to be homeless and wiping floors in stadiums, while most of us have been intellectually curious and dedicating our time to learn, read and listen people that are smarter than us. So either you are completely oblivious of how much information/education you have missed in the past 2 decades (and how far behind you are vs other actual intelligent people), OR you think yourself smarter than the majority, in which case I have to remind you that smart people not necessarily start questioning the world at the age of 30, certainly don't spend their 20s doing manual work and living with their parents. Forming rational thoughts is not an acomplishment, I get it you are excited because this is new to you, but most people were doing that in high school, (while passing the classes you are still completely oblivious about, like Calculus? do you even know what that is?). Be humble, you will learn more that way.﻿You're a retard. It's literally Arabic for "God is great". Unless you want all Arabs to stop praising whatever God they worship then it's not a phrase you can solely attribute to terrorists. This thinks that the most midwest state is Illinois https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-states-are-in-the-midwest/

I think what happened is as people moved further west, more people wanted to call states further west Midwest instead of west because "west" has the implication that it's like the frontier.

I think it sort of makes sense, I can see why people would call stuff that far west Midwest, because a good number of people have moved out there and a place like eastern Nebraska is probably more like Ohio than it is like western Nebraska, which I think is pretty clearly like "west" west. 

I don't think it makes sense to redefine Midwest away from Ohio Illinois and Indiana though. Those states are like the OG Midwest states. I mean you're literally arguing with a native Arabic speaker. It's never been perceived that way to me. However, that isn't to say that Muslims don't think their God is the best, just like any other religious person.

It was quite different to how he usually does stuff and he didn't come across as good as he usually does, because the viewer wasn't being that much of a dick to him.

That might have been kind of true maybe 20 years ago when we only had around 10% private schools. Since then the highest amount of private schools was in 2011/12 (17% elementary schools; 50% highschools) and the current level is 17% and 33%.

Edit: To speculate on why she thinks that; I'm guessing that she bases her opinion on a national exam from this year (where everyone of the same age do identical tests on a national level). Swedish alt-right people were upset because a part of the test was on quantitative words where the example sentences were about the migration crisis back in 2015.

In this test the students had to assess whether sentences like the following had a correct quantitative word:

* *Most* refugees are not terrorists.

* *Some* refugees flee from war and conflict.

* *A few* migrants are criminals.

You had to be an absolute retard to not understand that these were not at all controversial statements – and the people who spoke out against them were ironically people who are typically against things like degeneration of language.

Since Swedish/Nordic alt-right seems to network with their North American counterparts I'm guessing it's this particular story that gave her that opinion. Just to be clear: She's absolutely wrong.So you're saying you were underage at the time? Got it.Adblock TriHardNick is basically the Christian equivalent of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

When Lauren Southern and Roaming Millennial go on, and on, and on about how they want to start families literally adds nothing to the conversation but stroke their own ego and virtue signal to their supporters and other people with the same value system as them that they are nice and wholesome women. 

Same thing when Roaming went off on a tangent about her grandfather. Idk how it's not clear to everyone else that they just want a sense of moral superiority to whomever, by talking about traditional family values when they themselves don't even fit in the traditional, child rearing mold. Of course they have a million justifications for this, but again... it's not about the argument, it's about framing things in a way to justify some sense of self-worth to themselvesThis subreddit should go back to it's roots: discussions about Destiny 2 the game.Or you don't use the shitty divide symbol and just write it as a fraction so there can be no ambiguity?Basically my position on violence against Nazis is this:

It's not some trivial thing to have a liberal society. It's not enough to just say that is what you want, because there are lots of people in the world who might easily say they want a liberal society, but they don't have it, for complex reasons.

One question is, is punching Nazis an example of a working liberal society? 

It doesn't really seem like it, that is why some people are upset, but I think it's sort of a superficial grievance.

But the more important question I think, is what separates a functioning liberal society from one that isn't liberal and doesn't function well?

Why are the necessary conditions for a functioning liberal society eroding? Why are there Nazis trying to move into the mainstream begging this question?

A vain person might treat a blemish on their skin as a very serious problem. True, ideally skin would not have blemishes.

But is the blemish acne or smallpox? Is the Nazi being punched the extent of the issue alone, or simply a manifestation of a much larger problem?

It seems to me that people that are not at serious risk from a Nazi regime seem to be more likely to think the superficial problem is worth addressing, and people that are at risk from a Nazi regime think the underlying problem is more important.

I think you have misrepresented pythons position on writing the problem this way

Another things is searching for games that are on other drives. For example when I search for League, it gives me the file on my documents, not the application and not even the file where it is installed. https://i.imgur.com/oM7Gvkh.png

Pretty handsome. &gt; The uninstall portion of the control panel is called "Add or remove programs". Try searching for that!

Well it clearly showed up as an option, so it knew what I intended to search but decided to give something else as the best match. Also I used to search uninstall on Windows 7 and it would gives the remove programs thing as the first result. It's a minor thing, but it can clearly be improved.

Also, I have my indices set up fine, it sometimes gives results from my other drives but not all the time, such as with games. Someone mentioned that it could be to do with me disabling telemetry and other bloatware on W10, which may have fucked with the search functionality.I was trying to explain to him in chat why I thought his stuff was anti-semetic, and it seemed like he cared a bit but then he blew me off.

Basically it went like this, to paraphrase

Me: Your video seemed anti-semetic

Him: I showed both sides

Me: It seems to me like that wasn't really both sides it seems like propaganda

Him: Making propaganda isn't bad people are smart and propaganda doesn't work against smart people

Me: It seems to me like you don't understand what propaganda is if you think it works like that.

To be honest I was not really expecting that point, I thought we would both understand why propaganda is bad. I thought the issue of whether it was propaganda or not was the debate, but he sort of shifted it to "is propaganda bad or not".

I don't think that is a very robust position to hold, is there some way to get the chat log? I would like to make some sort of organized response.

I'm not sure if he is like intentionally bullshitting me or if he has sort of fooled himself into thinking that makes sense.Just look at who supports him. Naked Ape made a video talking about his love affair with JBP. Also, he makes about 60k plus on patreon a month from anti-sjw types. Generally, I don't think he is dishonest, and his life advice stuff is pretty ok. However, when he ventures outside of that into the realm of politics, saying things along the line of "there is no patriarchy", "sjw's and liberals are ungrateful" and that "we live in a meritocracy" he loses me.

Also his very loose use of terms like postmodernism and cultural Marxist makes me believe that he doesn't have a clue what he is talking aboutwtf i hate wacky steven nowBig mcthankies from mcspankiesare you 13wtf what a surprising referenceWho keeps saying "tremendous"?

True, but in this situation I wouldn't rule out the possibility that it's conscious.ok wow, just found this on fuentes his twitter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnFqRy7cXMg what are those comments lollmfao that laugh is so funny THEY DIDNT EVEN ALL HAVE FRENCH BRAIDS Just a reminder my dudes, his name translated in English is Nick Sources or even Nick Fountains. :DI don't need to make an issue of whether propaganda is inherently bad or not, it's sufficient for the point I am trying to make just for it to be bad in this context.

He is supposedly a member of the "skeptic" community and the pretense is that he is debunking or demystifying issues through his videos.

In addition to that he claimed that he was trying to show both sides and give an objective look at the issue.

So, in that context I thought we would both clearly understand why making propaganda is bad.Shit, my phrenology skills failed me!GET ‘EM OUTTA HERE!This is the problem with scientific illiteracy. She just claims that because women are more biologically apt to be care-givers to children then that is her duty on this earth. To be a stay at home mom. Which is very, very, wrong and only a result of her total concession to some imaginary authority. 

Also, it just seems like most of these women, use this rhetoric as some type of weird justification for their own worldview. This woman probably wasn't very ambitious from the start, and is using "evolutionary biology" as a scapegoat for her to sit on her ass, while her children are at schoolHe mentioned a mobile app he's releasing? Does anyone have more info on this? i've seen [this video](https://imgur.com/gJ5LIJw) shared/comment/liked by random people from my old high school on my facebook feed so many times that i decided to watch it to see what he said and goddamn what a mess. i hope the rest of his content is much better than this I don't wanna get into this... *proceeds to get into it*

[Prime example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhrVBSsiIqk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4)I unno, man. Have you noticed that middle-aged, white men who're using the computer for the first time really like to use ellipses?

You can decently predict ideologies people hold by their speech patterns and rhetoric.What is the actual point of this video? It's not even JF level of trying to analyse shit, this guy is just watching a hating after every sentence Destiny says.

From the first 10 minutes alone, I'm shocked that both Naked Ape and this guy rewatching their debate are still going on about how GDP alone is not a good way to measure an economy. As soon as it was mentioned Destiny already said that he agrees but they just ignore that and keep repeating it. This guy literally pauses the video (to Google California's GDP to make a point about how GDP alone isn't a good measure, as if everyone doesn't already know that) as Destiny is about to say that he already agrees with this point.

Oh and also, when I say he Google's California's GDP, he didn't actual make a point about how GDP alone isn't a good measure, he literally just saw that it was 14% of the USA's GDP and said that California is "fucked", therefore GDP is a bad measure. Amazing analysis by this dude.

From these 10 minutes, I wouldn't suggest anyone watch this shit because it's basically a guy watching Destiny talk with Naked Ape while he spews YouTube-tier comments.

EDIT: something possessed me to watch 5 more minutes, this guy actually goes on to say that if the iPhone was made in the US (or workers were paid more) or if the minimum wage for McD workers was lowered that the prices of the products wouldn't change. wowzers.He says that an iPhone costs $800 and is made in China, and so it's already expensive meaning that if it were made in the US it would cost the same price, because he seems to think that "expensive" is a price. He can't comprehend the concept of something being more expensive?

Is it fair to take what these idiots say at face value or should one still try and accurate interpret this shit and hope they mean something intelligible?Can someone explain what this app is? WOW this Destiny fella sounds terrible.The duality of man..Hey thanks

Excited to use it :^)I personally had a friend of mine inducted into this weird cult of personality. A lot of white men idealize him as some sort of crusader after the whole c-16 debacle. I got recommended a video and checked him out and after seeing a video about Jung Jesus noped out. 

He is just another Sam Harris, but slightly more dishonest, religious, and volatileSomeone on stream (seemingly accidentally?) said you intend on doing off site tracking. Can you clarify? Or is this just regarding the website thing? Either way someone needs to address this.

EDIT: I should make it clear that this was in reference to a website, not an app, but I haven't been paying attention to what's been going on in regards to the two so I may be messing up between them.Slimy Steve slips out of our grasp yet again and lands in a puddle of hypocrisy. SAD performance!I'm not making it up, I was on the stream when the person said it and everyone in chat started spamming monkaS, the guy said he thought Destiny had muted the stream and Destiny said it's fine and everyone moved on. I didn't think to clip it and it's too much boring content to go through to find when it was said, but I'm sure someone else watching could vouch for this.

EDIT: I should make it clear that this was in reference to a website, not an app, but I haven't been paying attention to what's been going on in regards to the two so I may be messing up between them.Oh you mean the person on stream? Pretty sure the person was working on this site, they were talking to Destiny on Discord about features and things like that for the site. Maybe I misunderstood it idk, but the guy seemed legitimately nervous about what he said.Bad attempt of sarcasm on my part.Yeah, that and the soda/'alcohol' thrown on her looked so fucking fake... He kept filming and just zoomed in on her boobs. Guess that's a good way to get viewers. I think /u/unUSEFUL_idiot is a kind of a dick as well for linking and giving this "social experiment" views. Whatever. Also with the Twitch stuff happening meaning he did some short discussions with other big streamers.wut did Ash just die? Was that the end of the film?She might only play league with 3 fingers, but it looks to me like Lily has at least 4 fingers on the epistemology keyboard.

I don't know if that meme really makes sense but I would like to get back into this discussion I think there are some good arguments against non-compatibilist determinism.i think this is going to be the topic of my next blog post, so no reason not to make an outline of the argument here. Basically my argument for free will is sort of interdisciplinary and relies on things from computer science.

I actually think it might be possible to extend the halting problem to prove free will.

The halting problem was a practical problem for computer scientists that Turing proved was unsolvable. Basically the idea is computer scientists wanted a universal "determiner" do to speak that could take a look at the source code for a program and determine if the code would loop forever or eventually terminate.

Turing used a self-referential program to prove that the existence of some universal process that could make that determination would result in a paradox.

I don't think it's necessary to prove that human behavior can never be determined to show that free will exists, I think it's sufficient to show that no universal determiner can exist.

Specific determiners might be able to handle specific instances of human behavior, for example neurons firing in the motor center of the brain might deterministicly be predictive of a specific action.

This might be akin to a program that is easy to evaluate. Like there is no way a finite length program with no loops could run forever, and that is an easy heuristic to determine is some fraction of programs will halt or not.

However, if there is some deeper part of a humans brain that is actually doing computation, with something analagous to loops and complicated logic inside the loops, then even with a complete map of these neural activations there is no completely general process that will be able to determine what will happen. If such a general process existed then this would be a paradox, as shown by Turing's proof.

There is another part of the argument getting into simulations and computational irriducibility, and that is where there are some strong compatibilist arguments to be made. But you only need to go there after making some really heavy assumptions, like the existence of perfect simulators which would be a fundamentally different thing from Turings impossible halting determiner.

For example a simulator has no way to know if it is part of a halting program or not, but a determiner would need to know.GEORGE IS ACTUALLY HOTSHOTGG?[KiA irl](https://animationfascination.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/no_girls_allowed-225.jpg)I only recently began watching him, can't remember why though.Great summary. He also did a both sides-job on Charlottesville and offered a critical video on what the "endgame" of the NFL protests is. Guy is transparent as hell but I'd sure love to see a debate nonetheless. tbh I always think about being a leftist ex-Muslim YTer, does that exist? &gt;I can't believe you're reading into things. You can't say that this was implied.

&gt;LOOK AT THESE TWO EXAMPLES. CLEARLY THIS IS HOW THINGS ARE INEVITABLY GOING TO BE IN THE FUTURE. YOU'RE RETARDED.&gt;level with me here

&gt;please just be reasonable

&gt;racial diversity is just bad in general for economic growth

&gt;I'm not trying to be racist. It's just data and facts, man

&gt;wow man I can't believe *I'm* dealing with such immature children here, tsktsk&gt;;-; my feefeesI actually don't hate Jordan Peterson.

Who would you rather talk to, him or some youtuber like No BS. For one, like I would prefer to talk to somebody isn't in the running to say the dumbest thing I have ever heard every time they open their mouth.

It seems like people don't like him out of some obligate duty of ideological purity, but that isn't something I value.

It seems to me like the worst thing that he does is he sort of exaggerates the value of normal conventions in a changing society, but that doesn't seem to be like a completely insane position to me.

I think social conventions do have some practical value, as heuristics to make social interactions easier. I don't think that is the highest form of value beyond all other values. I don't rate social conventions as more important that unconventional peoples rights.

I think understanding the value of social conventions ultimately could help form a more just society, by helping to establish conventions that are not as oppressive as traditional ones.

But it seems like there is no room for that sort of dialogue or process to take place if like placing any value in convention is taken as an endorsement of "natural order" or some bullshit Allatoyah Fuentes stuff like that.&gt;using d.gg in the first placeThe fuck is he on about? Is he complaining about American football and sports in general? Why is he blaming the blacks for the way it is? Seems like people of every race like these sports and play in these sports.

The he wraps it by saying the NFL is basically like the US because anyone can be an American, doesn't really cover what it means to be an American (although brings up criticisms of things like it meaning being Christian/European but jokes about them and moves on.)This is something that I don't really understand.

Like it seems like the judgement being made is that he is bad because he is a political hack using sound bytes to steer a crowd of people.

It's weird because that is not the impression I get at all. Certainly some people are like that, and it is a massive problem across the political spectrum in general but it seems to me like if anything it's notable how he doesn't really do that as much as other people.

Maybe I'm just in the dark here and there is some really obnoxious example of him doing this that I am not aware of.You can see my view on him here.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/7az30b/exposed_a_pseudopsychological_analysis_of_jfs/

I wish Destiny would be more open to having him on again. The earlier discussions they had were some of the most interesting ones Destiny has ever had.What specific views of his do you disagree with?&gt;His views that black people are genetically inferior.

Inferior is a moral statement, I don't think he's ever claimed that black people are "genetically inferior." What he agrees with is simply that there are differences between races, (IQ included if I remember correctly) which is his definition of race realism. &gt;And that there is a biological truth which tells you that 'it is wrong to let other people make babies on your land'.

Gonna need a source for the full context for that claim. Biological truth and "wrong" might not mean that JF is saying he adheres to this, or that anyone else should, but simply that this preference has evolved in humans.

Most of the "worse views" you bring up are just factual statements. If by "worse" you mean they are factually wrong, then fine; feel free to disprove them.&gt;'The white race is getting extinguished. Deep inside you know that it is wrong to let these raping, pillaging savages breed on your ground. You're just rejecting this because of your white guilt.

Almost all of this is made up in your mind. Quote me where JF advocates this view, and not simply discussing the theory that the white race is getting extinguished.

&gt;The jews are secretly controlling society

The only thing I've heard JF say about this is that jews are overrepresenterad in powerful positions. You're again in your mind spicing that up to more than it is.

&gt;Hitler wasn't all that bad

Not actually a factual statement.

&gt;'So crime statistics are racist now?'&lt;-how could you even think this is anything other than straight facts

???

You're doing the same ultra intent-attributing meme Destiny is doing; no one is allowed to discuss controversial factual questions (e.g are there IQ differences between races?). Is it just not possible to be interested in the fact of the matter, without being a secret etho state, neo-nazi advocate? [Even I admit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/7az30b/exposed_a_pseudopsychological_analysis_of_jfs/) JF is pretty blind to intent and the nuance of language, but Destiny is the opposite extreme, which I think has bled off to lots of others here, such as yourself.Excuse me. It's "Cash Me Outside"I have heard Sargon sort of flounder around and throw out the words "Cultural Marxism" when trying to describe feminism, because he was really struggling to actually define it.

That didn't really seem like the academic usage of the term to me. So, I am aware of this term as a sort of ideological shibboleth.

It's not really a link to this on Wikipedia that is going to make the case against Peterson to me you need to link an example of him using it in that kind of context, that shows him trying to demonstrate ideological membership.

Basically it's important to me to establish the difference between like a sense ideological membership and a bias towards a certain position.

Using "cultural marxism" in a particular context, the way Sargon did seems to be a way of identifying himself with an ideology, and advocating for that ideology is important to him regardless of the argument at hand so he is likely to view things in that adversarial sort of way it seems you are suggesting.

I think that is sort of fundamentally different from having a bias towards your own point of view, but not necessarily viewing your position in terms of ideological membership. 

Bias is notoriously difficult to completely mitigate. I think it's probably true that nobody thinks completely objectively. I don't think it makes sense to expect people to not have a bias towards their own position.

I think all that can be really expected is that people trying to avoid ideological membership and express their opinions as individuals. When they do so they will have biases, but if having biases disqualifies people from having opinions than pretty much everyone is disqualified.

The difference is, if as an individual your bias is challenged, you are in a position to re-evaluate. If you are representing your ideological team the position is outside of yourself so this is not an option.

This is why in the latter case the only option left is to start flinging mud and make a show of what a good soldier you are.

So, like if you can find an example of him professing some ideological membership and communicating that he views himself as an agent for that ideology, I would rethink my opinion of him.

But if he has a bias somewhere in his own individual perspective, it might be the case that what to him seemed like a good faith effort to engage in an argument to you looked incomplete.

But the difference between somebody like that and somebody who is ideologically subscribed so to speak, is that as an individual you are in a position to making that good faith effort, where as many people just feel they are representing their team and will no make any effort beyond trying to mock or discredit challenges to their team.

So that is my challenge to you, if you want to change my mind about Peterson find an example of him demonstrating ideological membership, and acting as a blind agent for that "team" so to speak.Hmm, I'm gonna go with FALSE. Dat finna gonna destiny not autism but youre not culturally enriched on the daily, fam.The funny part is the last sentence of this post could be self referential and now I am doubting my own sanity.

Is that the meme?[Don't worry, even the people who've been around for a while still get nuke baited :\^\)](https://i.imgur.com/uVporqx.png)!momolewdsHe owns $DGG stockwhat even is thisI thought I had escaped this meme. But thanks to Gary, some of my stupidest statements are forever enshrined in this video. Enjoy boys and gals. If you're curious I was the one who said "couldn't AI just decrypt the encryption that we set on it." don't judge me..... I've since repented my autism in this debate. I've read up a bit more and my opinion has swayed since then (this was recorded months ago). I normally would not link to my own article in this subreddit, but i will because it's curiously relevant to this video, and I pretty much just wrote it last week.

Cellular Automata are basically a way of trying to find the simplest possible things that exhibit this sort of emergent behavior.

In the second half of the article there is a widget I coded where you can try different rules for the automata. You can click on the rules to change them, click on the red arrows to highlight stuff, or click on the cells at the very top to change the initial condition.

I've considered killing myself I like Bostrom, had to read some of his papers for a class. Superintelligence is on my shelf and I'll hopefully get to it at some point.I literally know nothing about AI (I have since read up on it actually), I just wanted to participate in the discussion, so he certainly knew more than me.

around the 35 minute markit's just bait, because some of them don't have any actual arguments. You just raised an argument, but they have to put it forward. They should say the majority of incestual relationships may have an interpersonal relationship that runs deeper then having sex with someone not related.

I give it to you that having an argument live is a skill that not many people have, and it makes them look stupid even though they are advocating for something morally agreed upon that you shouldn't fuck your siblings. i already have that oneTotal BiscuitMy concern is that if Destiny ever reaches out to serious people to have a discussion, the first thing they'll do is Google him, see his cancerous Twitter persona, and assume it would be a waste of their time. How are we ever get a debate with Sam Harris? i.e How will I ever get off?Haha, nice meme, manDo you see r/destiny fans calling for an ethno state? What a lame concern troll.Steven Bonnell the One-thBe honest was anybody confused by the arm behind the guy's head?&gt;not that I agree with creating an ethnostate or in any way think that lauren southern supporters share anything similar to nazis, but don't you think this **body shaming** is a little immature?

&gt;cmon guys. Do you think **you** shape up better comparatively? Because that's seemingly what I seem to think the point of this post was because I'm a fucking dumbass.

Cool to see an average photo of lauren southern supporters caused so many of you to get this upset tho.To be fair you have to have a very high IQ to understand copy pasta&gt;look at me miss the point

&gt;don't put words in my mouth, but let me put words in yours hurrrrdurrrrMate, it's been explained to you multiple times. You're very clearly the dumbfuck here.

&gt;addled brain

"Don't you dare vex me, mortal! Huzzah"&gt;too stupid to read other comment chains, including another one he was in.

&gt;lmao xd ur 12 hhahaLot of effort to say you don't understand the argument. It's okay, m'dude.

Tbh tho, I think you're acting quite niggardly.You've got a LOT to learn Harradar, A LOT.The original note about racial discrimination was removed in the end anyway. Also these kinds of school trips are the most standard in the UK, I remember my school took us to a Jewish synagogue and everyone including the Muslims came with no problem.

If you really have something against the trip, then just don't go and take that notice on your record, they literally mean fuck all. Also, £5 for a school trip is nothing, they would've had no problem paying that if the trip was to somewhere else.I heard that a lot of streamers will viewbot to get to around 2-3k viewers and then play a lot of games with other legit streamers around that number of viewers and seem like they are legit.
Streamers who do that also usually donate to themselves./r/ElsaGate 

Basically a lot of really dodgy videos on YouTube targeted at children but show some disturbing content. Some believe it's by pedos or some others who are attempting to alter the psyche of children.That video is quite the "steelman"I understand why you wouldn't want to jump to it being conspiracy, but either way the content is disturbing. If it were just for money, why does it also have to have really weird shit in it? If you just look at some of the videos covered they're pretty fucked up, some of them even with real children. In the comments of a lot of these videos, you will see very perverted comments and it's pretty creepy.I watched it twice, would recommend sharing with friends and family. B+ well deserved.In many cases there actually are pretty good records I thought. The Nazis themselves kept records in many cases.That's a really sweet website they got going on. The round of people they've got so far would be such a funny circle jerk to watch. I think Destiny is better off not going tbh.That tweet was really strange. One of the only reasons I have any respect for Peterson is the fact that he was pretty vocally anti-trump before and during the election, and called him a con-man.

I don't know how you get from thinking the Donald is a con-man to thinking that taking away the man-babys twitter is treason.This, but unironically token jew*Fair enough, maybe Twitter isn't fair with who it applies the rules too and and I do think Bunty maybe shouldn't have been banned, but is making a comparison to threats towards the POTUS really the same as towards other personalities?WOWZERS Trudeau must go I guess!I think i'll pay a little extra and go to the supermarket of ideas instead. hmm are SJWs destroying the world or is it the Muslims. 10 hour debate ensues. I think the degree to which the criticism is valid is pegged to how influential the person on twitter or college is.

If the college isn't really teaching critical thinking, then that is going to damage the students moving forward. The amount of damage would be proportional to the size of the college.

Crying about one random feminist on twitter with no audience is absurd. Crying about one with a massive audience, or a university, is less absurd, assuming there is actually something to cry about.

I just checked, this school has 17,000 undergraduates. It's no OSU, but that is still a pretty big school.Basically it seems like what you are saying is that the teacher of the class has an obligation to hold the hand of the class and sort of guide them through the material. To do the critical thinking for them, and present material like this with hints as to how they can critically evaluate it.

In a sense you are right. I think she does have a responsibility to demonstrate the techniques of critical thinking, and develop the skills of the students before throwing something like this at them. 

However, what if she has already done that? What if they class has already completed many assignments where they demonstrated that they are capable of critically evaluating arguments?

If that is the case, then it seems like stretching the university policy to claim that she has not presented the clip critically. The schools stance in that case is to say it's impossible to actually teach critical thinking. The class can not be expected to perform it themselves, even after taking the course and learning the techniques.

What if this is at the end of a course where she has already taught all the techniques to critically evaluate things like this, and is presenting this in that context for her class to critically evaluate it. I think in an important sense, in that context, she has actually presented it critically.

If you want to stay that material like this must be provided in a very particular way, with lots of guided cues, even at the end of a critical thinking class, basically that is an insult to her because it's suggesting that she was not able to actually teach the class.

It seems like it's not even a matter of critical vs uncritical but more a matter of sentiment. There is an important difference between presenting something critically and presenting something with a particular sentiment, and it seems like the university official has it mixed up here.I looked up the average school size as well I think it was around 6,000.

The school I went to had 11,000 undergraduates and I thought it was a medium sized school. As I said 17,000 is not massive, but it does seem pretty substantial.

Really it comes to down to priorities. Is teaching critical thinking more or less important than taking an expansive interpretation of ethical restrictions towards what is appropriate to teach?

For one, my knee jerk reaction is that critical thinking is probably more important, and the school is mistaken in the position they seem to be taking. It's true that my outside perspective might not be charitable to the institution.

It's also know that I tend to be biased against institutions. But this is the value of diversity. Different people have had different experiences, and are going to have different perspectives, different biases, and different people will express different points of view and somewhere in that noise will be something more like the truth.

I think that is sort of the irony of the far left's tendency to value ideological purity. Diversity has real value, and it makes me think that people that want to enforce some sort of rigid and pure doctrine are just giving lip service to diversity and don't understand why it is actually valuable.Oh hey I go to that school

I'm sitting in class and my prof just made a joke about it like twenty min ago lol

Kind of disappointing to be honest, giving people like this ammoI agree. JF doesn't seem to care about intent or anything that's going on inside the actor's mind, but only the consequences. So as long as he 4d chessed people into thinking about logic (accidentally or intentionally), it's a positive for JF. 

Though I'd be interested to hear what JF has to say about Molyneux going back and fixing the mistake. Is Molyneux taking away a valuable 4d chess learning opportunity by correcting the mistake. 

I'm guessing that in this case there is no option where JF would criticize Molyneux. Either he: is a genius by intentionally or accidentally making a mistake and getting people to think about logic or he's a genius because he went back to fix this mistake and is now providing people with correct information about logic. Molyneux can do no wrong.&gt; That doesn't mean that pursuing the truth is pointless

what exactly do we stand to gain from researching this topic specifically?Because I don't believe it's realistic. If you think there's pushback again the race iq question now, imagine what will happen when you tell people that blacks are now the designated intelligently handicapped race that needs our charity. This is not a pill our society will swallow. Same goes for going the other way. We're never going to agree to kick all the blacks out of our great white ethnostate, this is just some people's fantasy. 

There's plenty of IQ research to be done, why focus on race? 

[I'm mostly just repeating what this article says](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/449208/race-iq-debate-serves-no-purpose)No metaphor, this is LITERALLY footage from the debate.&gt; You could make the same arguments for something like climate change. I just don't see sticking our heads in the sand as being the solution.

You're implying that there's some kind of similar overarching problem of low iq blacks that is in any way comparable to global climate change. We can address the current issues that poor (disproportionally black) people are facing. There's plenty of shit to do. And sure, some of that involves IQ research, but even that does not necessarily have to be race based. &gt; My point was just that, even if you have extremists advocating for each side of the argument, that doesn't mean that the discussion itself isn't worth having.

I never talked about extremists so I'm not sure why you say that. We either help black people less because they are low IQ (good luck selling that to the general public), help black people more because they are low IQ (again, good luck with that) or keep doing what we are already doing (what was the point of the research in the first place?) 

&gt; A lot of what we have tried has failed, for example increasing school funding (which Destiny is a proponent of) doesn't seem to help. 

actually, destiny specifically brings up this and mentions how throwing money at the problem doesn't help and that we need a more nuanced solution. Again, I'd be interested to know how blacks being low IQ helps us resolve this issue. We still don't know how to actually raise people's IQ. Our previous attempts so far have failed. 

&gt; I'm also pretty skeptical about the effects of programs like affirmative action, but I haven't had the time to look into it enough to draw any sort of conclusion.

Again, I'm interested to know how blacks being genetically inferior helps us address the problem?

&gt;  I think establishing some base facts would be a better starting point to fix our current problems.

The IQ gap is already an established fact. How does knowing that blacks are gnetically inferior help us here?

If you want to champion iq research that is specific to race, you also have to explain how this specific research is going to be useful to us. &gt; Not true. Research is simply the process of acquiring knowledge. It doesn't have to have a reason. Sometimes knowledge leads to good things, sometimes it leads to bad things. Sometimes it leads to both (nuclear power). 

Right, but if someone says "i will dedicate my life to studying dog testacle circumference", i'm not gonna say: "wow cool, you are going to pursue knowledge^TM and truth." We only care about knowledge because it's helpful to us in some way. I don't think it's a false dichotomy to suggest that we have limited resources on what to spend our research on and we should justify how we spend that money. It is possible that the genes that cause visual characteristics we use to identify race are also impacting the heritability of IQ, but I'm not really sure why we are picking this specific hypothesis to test.Like a broken record.[It's too late, someone already made an account that documents all of his dumbest takes](https://twitter.com/stillgray/)it is a frog that is thinkingFollowed.

I just think if he is center right and anti-trump, he is a strange priority compared to other public figures.

He does seem to be pandering to the wrong sort of people now though. What I really want to see is him explain his position on Trump to this kind of audience. I think it would do a lot of good. I'm sort of starting to give up on him though, I'm not sure if it's going to happen.
You've fallen for his four-dimensional pedo-chess. Disgustiny.Yes, let's not criticise her based on her words or actions, but rather on the most extreme people who hold "ideas like these."Can't finish a small plate just like his kid.It's nothing personnelle II.Trump is very pro Israel though... really makes (((you))) thinkTo me the free will debate is isomorphic to a debate about numbers.

The point about the marble and the hill is vaild, but not the way he phrased it. For example, if you have an extremely chaotic system, like a box full of ping pong balls that you shake around, it is hard to describe just how sensitive that system is.

Each time a ball collides, any minute angular difference in position is transformed into a difference in trajectory. That means the further the ball travels after the collision, the more it amplifies the original difference.

Keep in mind as you continue to shake the box, they collide more than once. So this amplification is multiplied, and then that is multiplied, and it's exponentially amplified the more collisions there are. Like interest compounding.

Just shaking a box of ping pong balls will exponentially amplify the most minute possible differences in original position. So in order to properly describe the end result of something so sensitive, you need every input no matter how minuscule.

Everything in the observable universe exerts gravity, so if you shake the box enough you will need to simulate everything in the observable universe to determine the result. Not every star. Everything full-stop. That is how sensitive that process is. This is disregarding any kind of quantum true randomness. 

There isn't really a "Free-Will" side, so to speak, because there isn't really any way to prove that exists.

To me, one side claims the states of the universe from one moment to the next is predetermined. The other claims that states of the universe from one moment to the next have an unknown origin.

The second claim doesn't really support free will as much as it just doesn't refute it.
 
Imagine you had some method of encoding everything into a number. The position of every atom, and all the details you need to know about the atoms. The observable universe is finite, so if you encoded the entire observable universe you would get some stupendously large finite number.

Entropy in the universe is increasing, so that means if you encode the next moment in time, you would get a larger number. Somewhere in that number, is the result you wanted to predict.

So, the question becomes, if you are in the universe represented by the first number, does the next number already exist?

A knee-jerk reaction might be to claim that it does, but keep in mind this number would be so massive it would be completely unobservable. No person or computer would be able to store it in memory, ever, with any technology. No computation could produce the second number from the first number.

The only sense in which the number exists is just the abstract sense that there are supposed to be an infinite amount of numbers that exist.

So then, to me, the next question is, did all the numbers come to exist at the same time? How would that occur?

Generally people prefer to chose the explanation that involves the least amount of mysticism. I don't really believe in some all powerful process that could have created all the forms that exist all at once.

I think a much simpler explanation is that there was a simple compounding processes that has a simple operation, and left to it's devices it created more complexity.

To me this means that the numbers, even the abstract forms, were created inductively in sequence. 

Basically I believe that time is the very inductive process that is creating the numbers in abstract, and it's progress represents the current state of the universe represented as a number.

If you claim that the universe is already pre-determined, then I think that is a more magical claim because it relies on some supernatural capability of the universe to store a number in some sort of magical memory and I don't see how that could be possible.

To me an undetermined universe, magical though it might seem at first glance, is the simpler option. Basically what I am saying is the properties of the next number are unknowable and have a mysterious origin.

This to my mind is a less radial claim than the claim that all the numbers simultaneously came to exist, because whatever process that did that would need to be much more complex than something inductive. To me it seems like a theistic sort of crutch, that something all powerful must have intervened.This was also posted by a resident shitposter who constantly posts some really racist and sexist shit tbf. I'm thankful for the Golden Age of Dustiny we experienced this year. We got top memes such as DonTron, Fumbling Fuentes, SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP, and "You're so dumb, bro". In Godstiny's name. Amen. Stay away from destinyIll have you know that one time somebody donated to destiny ON STREAM and said “im gonna shiot up a school and write destiny.gg on the walls” AND DESTINY LAUGHED AT IT.

All you dickriders just care about yourselvesI just love her so much ;-;Are you trying to suggest that I give him money or something?

Do you honestly prefer Trump over Peterson? No BS / Mouthy Budda over Peterson?

Are you so stupid you cannot fathom that I might disagree with someone but that I prefer disagreeing with somebody that has some credentials and isn't a complete retard?

I'm not trying to pass your purity test. It's a dead end. I'm trying to figure out what is actually going to be an effective remedy for Trumpism.

I bet you prefer Trump to Peterson because Trump just makes it so easy to feel superior, and that is all you are interested in.

Go fuck yourself.[Improvement since last time i checked](https://i.imgur.com/EGloLOC.png)I definitely always got this sense from the way Trump speaks - he begins thoughts and although it looks like nonsense on paper, it's easy to derive certain meanings from his syntactically frenetic speech patterns 

I feel like this is also why center/left people say his more scripted speeches are better - because he can't do this weaselly bsThis guy is speaking poetry while cooking rice. Amazing content.“Sweden is rape city”

You know your country is FUCKED when so many people want to talk about stupid non-issues like 'white genocide' yet are happy to repeal obamacare even if it would mean tons of people would suffer because of that.How can we be completely sure that it's really him?Right forgot about that.

It's at 3:08:30Mine

Get cucked nerdwtf pls we are doing our bestI'm an ex-muslim but I'm not a huge fan of the subreddit based on the brief visits I've paid it. It seems to be less of a support group and more of a sorta toxic "let's shit on Islam" group - look at the [first post](https://imgur.com/96piXye) there under the stickied postsHow many upvotes for that?How many upvotes for that?I said she isnt a girlFucking idiotIt’s pretty funny coming from himMY NEPHEW ISNT REALYOU WONT THATS HOWLul. Yes because that'd show how right Miller is! Double WammyAnyone got clips of Destiny watching/reacting to this? At least the part with him?So the plot of The Sandlot?https://soundcloud.com/offthejump/ibrahim-primrose

here's mine

i modified the chord progression a little and based the rest of this track on that but destiny's main melodic motif is there in a bunch of placesAm I missing something here? Did Destiny debate Peterson at some point? Why all the Peterson updates?I kinda am in that boat. I supported Trump because I was fucking retarded. Don't remember which video I watched at first, but I think it was one of Destiny's league videos with Lily that got me interested in him. I thought he was fucking hilarious so I went to his channel to find more videos of league. I watched a few, but because I was always someone who had very strong political opinions, I saw some videos with subjects like incest, abortion, and especially the Jontron one that peaked my interest, since I loved Jontron's vids. After watching most of his content in the last few months, I don't consider myself a hardcore "alt-right" republican anymore. I consider myself more of a centrist with shared views on both sides, but leaning more to the right, because I'm Christian. Even though I know Destiny makes fun of Christians often, I still enjoy his content and debates. They've really opened my eyes to see things in ways I had never considered before. I honestly don't know who the usual suspects are that you are referring to.

Leftists? Russian trolls pretending to be leftists?if you multiply the amount of people in finland by about  you will get the same relative base population, which would put finland at (4*65=260) 260 deaths over the lasts 20 years, versus 3208I'm not pretending anything I was just making some guesses trying to understand your post.

I guess you cleared it up a little bit. Authoritarians then?

Do you consider Peterson to be anti-Authoritarian? I am not really sure about that he seems to have some ideas about "hierarchies of competence" which sort of seem like pro-Authoritarian memes to me.

To me he seems more attached than necessary to existing power structures and institutions. I would prefer to see a world where people develop new ideas and make their own success.

For example it seems to me like his "hierarchies of competence" so to speak in many cases are just a corrupt messes, like the political lobbies for big sugar and fossil fuels, that sort of thing. To my mind those types of institutions are more of a real threat that Peterson seems to think socialists are.

But Peterson comes from Canada so things might be different there. They might not have corporate interests dictating policy there. Maybe "Marxists" or whatever he invests his energy in opposing are a more pressing issue there. I won't really pretend to know because that isn't my experience. But I don't think that set of priorities translates well to the USA, especially not in the political moment that we are having here.

Here we have "competence hierarchies" proving their corruption and incompetence. If he is going to become an international figure, I either want him either comment in a meaningful way towards what I perceive to be a more severe problem, or stop showing up so much with messages that seem to me to be impertinent.Still better than einsteen&gt; I don't expect you to publicly condemn your friend

Then what do you expect them to do? Why would they cut off making videos with their friend especially since the videos have nothing to do with his personal political beliefs.

&gt;ignoring that he said it won't solve the issue.

And addressing it sure won't solve anything either I don't think. What does anyone benefit from when he gets called out, especially by Ethan who is just a friend of his and isn't a politics dude.

That being said, I agree with what you said, I think this kinda stuff with people like Jon can be dealt with in private with their friends. Calling him out on a video would be a dick thing to do.I think the country proposed in the cultural factors for this video would be massively disfunctional.

Given the cultural values as presented, it would be nation of people cheating on science tests, falsifying resumes, and then a lot of blame going around for a lot of missing acheivment.

I think this country would basically be a dumpster fire in short order.

I think it's likely that there are some roles in society best filled by very competitive very skilled people. But I think the most productive class in society, the people actually making the wheels turn are people with less ambition.

They need to value dillegence, honesty, empathy, stability, community. Integrity basically. Kids should learn that they will be valuable if they have integrity. These are the people that are going to show up, work for a wage every day, and not stab each other in the back.

I would bet on a country with a backbone of people with those values outperforming the richland described in that video.WOW, UNDENIABLE PROOF THAT STEVE GISH GALLOPS HIS OPPONENTS.LOL destiny's reactionThat isn't the point. You were claiming that the video represented the flaws of a "least worst" system, so despite being flaws you were suggesting that kind of society would be accompanied by enough benefit to be worth it.

I'm not convinced the least worst scenario you envision reflects a real understanding of where wealth comes from, and the flaws of that least worst system are actually just sacrifices for no benefit.Gosh I didn't want to do this... 

but you do realize how stupid you sound right. Nobody wants to debate the althype because he is a CONSPIRACY THEORIST, let me repeat it, a conspiracy theorist. 

What argument can be had against someone that isn't willing to try to arrive at truth claims. If someone has an ideology and literally everything has to conform to that ideology, then you are officially an ideologue. It really is that simple. yeah according to his audience he is going to win every debate. I don't know if you pay attention/watch the streams but Blesstiny says it best, you literally need a PhD level background in genetics to argue with someone who is operating out of normal laymen paradigms. 

Perfect example. If I say that this country won't have social security in another fifty years, that is a falsifiable claim that we can fact check. If I say that black people have different allele frequencies, not only does that require careful research, it also requires at the very least a bachelor level background in human biology, genetics, and cognition. It's not as simple as reading a research paper and interpreting the data you find.

So tl;dr: Nobody wants to debate the althype, not because they would 'lose', but because he is an idiot without any intellectual credibilityWhat is the real difference between a goose, and a duck in a black cape with a hood?Omar wa moo shindeiroo&gt;He seems pretty smart to me

He's one of those "decent intelligence, low wisdom" kind of guys.I don't know... Sounds like a choice meme and after the recent video with Sinclair, I'm not sure I can handle exskillsmeh jumping on that topic as well. The idea is that integrity creates wealth. From there, competition makes that process more efficient.

But, making the process more efficient only increases wealth if the participants have integrity.

Competition valued above integrity leads to cheating, which decrease total wealth.

So, whatever you are doing competition will make it more efficient. If a society does not have the correct bearing, it might use competition to ruin itself very efficiently.May i direct you over to r/enoughpetersonspam. Although many people have qualms with Peterson, the reason I think Destiny is not onboard with him is who he aligns himself with. That being the alt-right, and we all know that they are a bunch of weridos.

Peterson moreso. You would think an intellectual who has tenure at University of Toronto would not y'know, not spout blatantly wrong, borderline regressive opinions about bill c-16 and women.My understanding of "red pill" vs "blue pill" is sort of like different parts of the brain.

I think when people talk about "redpilling" someone what they are talking about is evoking a limbic system response. So that is like the "3 Fs" so to speak. Fight, flight, and sex.

So if somebody is "redpilled" basically what they are saying is that they are emotionally invested in their position, they are afraid/angry about current circumstances, and interested in obtaining power. 

Usually this is accompanied by various gruesome other beliefs that compliment and reinforce that state of mind. "White Genocide" for example, is like the sort of rhetoric used to fire up the fear factory.

To me "blue pilled" sort of just means trying to be reasonable or trying to think without excessive emotional investment in something. Chilling out a bit.

This gives rise to the classic problem where people on the right often seem very convicted and emotionally invested in their position, but they are often completely wrong. Meanwhile people on the left try to be reasonable and they often are but that sort of necessarily removes the visceral emotional sort of charge that would help them follow through with that.

So you often end up with people who are angry and wrong in charge and then lots of people who are trying to be reasonable complaining about itOh yeah the bitch who licked a knife and got banned for acting "crazy" on stream calls anyone else cringy. Nice memeSomebody would claim the opposite, but I don't think that means the situation is symmetrical.

It's true both sides might criticize the other for not being rational, or not being reasonable, but I think the source of error is different.

On the right I think it's this sort of limbic system emotion that motivates people. On the left I think it's a desire to be correct gone awry, where people meme too much about what is correct and you end up with structures that are too rigid.

I'm not really sure about the fetishization of logic and rationality to me it seems like power and ego are fetishized.

Can you explain why you think that?

It's curious that our perceptions are so different I think.Well, I read the abstract.

I think we live in a sort of interesting time, where there are elements of the political right that is not necessarily conservative.

I don't think conservative is the right way to describe Trumpism, and is increasingly not a good way to describe the political right.

It's sort of like the difference between liberal and progressive. 1960 was a long time ago. Long enough ago that progressive counterculture has had time to define it's own social norms and codes of conduct. For example it's considered extremely rude to exclude or discriminate against people based on race or something they cannot control.

Just as a traditional religious conservative will follow a traditional code of conduct, progressive people follow a code of conduct as well.

Trumpism defies both. It's not particularly traditional or christian. It's a novel thing. And it certainly is not following a progressive code of conduct either.

I think a diligent religious person following the rules of their community has more in common with a progressive doing the same than either has with someone engaged with the new Trump style politics.Centrists who side with nazis aren’t centrist how does this thought never get brought upRight... Talk about playing both sidesAh gotcha - thanksthis is my fav person destiny has talked to holy shit lmaoI've been aware of this variety of meme.

I'm not Asian myself, so maybe I don't have a completely objective perspective on this, but imo I don't think Asian men are at a big disadvantage when it comes to dating the type girl that is actually fun to date.

There may be some number of white women that would not date an Asian guy, but I was out there dodging those girls too. Girls like that probably also like bad country music and don't play any video games at all.

Like a lot of my social life had been people brought together by my old wow guild. I've heard the girls talk about how they like Asian guys.

Maybe there are less girls like that but imo those are the ones worth trying to find anyway.WTF is this thread about besides to bully Mouton? If you don't like don't watch its fucking simple. Stop acting like the Ice Poseidon sub.The problem is, this thread is to just shit on Mouton, who whether anyone likes him or not (full disclosure I sub to him) is Destiny's friend. All this does is try to create drama and unnecessary hate.Reading the comments of the YT vod is so disheartening
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foutPY888vc

-A quarter of the comments is just talking about why Destiny is "retarded" and "full of contradictions" because...

How can people live their lives this way. They just come to gut decisions about everything, and these skeptics aren't making it any better. Words like "free-speech" and "political correctness" have just ruined discourse these days because they are cover-all, virtue signaling words that just completely shut down critical discourseIdk if my favorite part is "when da ting went quack quack quack, you man were duckin", or "either way, A B C D, alphabet ting"

I was sort of annoyed by this song at first because I sort of follow grime and it's sort of fucked up that parody grime got this big before real grime did.

I'm over it now though this song is pretty funny.Maybe he shouldn’t be friends with nazis next time It arguably is. Big Shaq was a character in a comedy series.

It isn't completely clear cut though, the guy is pretty skilled, and Grime I think is more about enthusiasm and musicality vs image compared to hip hop.

Just because he started as a comedy character doesn't necessarily mean the comedian can't become a "real" grime artist. But that isn't how he started out.

I would really curious to see what happens if Big Shaq comes into a session like this. Would he be "in character"? It's sort of a puzzle for him to solve I think.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOIF7iUn-Z8

If he can make that work then he is a real grime artist.I don’t like the word retarded as an insult but it’s the first word I think of when I see Sargon mentionedI got 7 minutes in. Holy shit they are dumber than I thought. All they do is reeeeFascists don’t play by the rules. Contra really exposes thier thought process in her videos about themNo that’s logical Remember when h3h3 called out bullshit instead of pandering to the alt right Money makes people abandon all thier values doesn’t itthis was hard to watch at first but it may just be much to do about nothing. Just trying to be objective as possible she may have just overreacted. BUT if what she said was true then her parents are kind of dicks, when your kids tell you their life is hard then you should take it seriouslyit's easy to be consistent if your worldview is literally that of a really smart 14 yr/ old. Girls should stop complaining, blacks should just get married, the regressive left is the worst thing in the world.

Consistency in beliefs while important can also just be code for.... no nuanced ideas whatsoeverI mean she's living in their house, they make the rules. Not sure why you are all white knighting for a teen causing parental drama.I love her Twitter where she says she is a centrist but just tweets alt right propaganda He's consistent to the point of being a literal sociopath on some issues. &gt;PS: Could you stop playing games during debates please?! Nobody wants to hear that shit...

Or at least just mute the game... or maybe even relay the game audio to yourself but not to the stream.A collosal victory for the flea market of higher cognitive functions&gt;want to play leaguecentrism makes the money, sjwism gets the honeysDestiny is Cupid in the fleshIt’s not the same type of debating he would probably loseDestiny has a webcam you idiotfucking retradhttps://youtu.be/l9E2iEi6vMY Sargon is one of the dumbest people on the internet Anyone who is pushing the sjws killed her narrative is truly a piece of human garbage. We knew Ian was garbage long before but still no one kills themselves over being called homophobic online. There are other factors we don’t know about with every Suicide 1) Her being a woman was a bonus. I mean, "I'm with Her" was more then a political slogan, it was virtue signaling to show the world that America is progressive and we DON'T care about gender. Which, among most people on the left is generally true.

Also, Hilary is the embodiment of establishment politics. She was the first lady, was on the board of walmart(which is the epitome of big business),and gave several talks to big businesses to support her campaign. Now for all I know, most of this could be discredited but the only thing you would need to prove is that this is the narrative that surrounded her.

2)It was unique because she was running against Bernie Sanders who was taking far less money from big business, and was running on a campaign against establishment politics.

3) No... Nobody likes to feel like corporations are controlling their lives

I don't know how you argue this to your family but you have to show them how delusional they are if they think Hilary is anywhere near a good politician. She is arguably the worst politician in history. She lost to Obama, and Trump. Let that sink in...

Someone who had everything going for her was beat by the first black president, and Trump. They can debate why this happened all day long, but the reality is that if she was anywhere near a good politician she would have won.

Now I see, where they are coming from. Misogyny definitely played into this. I had a young woman at my job(i live in the south) tell me  "she doesn't think a women is fit to be president" and I am talking HS level young. However, for them to extrapolate that it is why she lost takes evidence. 

p.s: don't feel bad that you were stumped. Live debating takes composure, and expediency

edit: A huge part of why she lost was because she didn't inspire her base to come out and vote for her, perhaps... and this is just my wild guess; is because... she is a bad politician. I know crazy right?oh boi *cracks knuckles* I did a fair bit of research, but you should probably just read this polygon article https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/29/16709796/magic-the-gathering-cosplayer-harassment-youtube

and this(kind of biased, but still noteworthy) reddit response by /u/RarerMonsters
https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/7fb3iz/christine_sprankle_quitting_magic_cosplay_due_to/dqazudz/

Now the polygon article, albeit being pretty objective and non-critical, was deemed "bad journalism" by this guy

Now my take. As someone who is only into magic on the very base level is that this guy "Jeremy" is pretty much, the male version of a radical feminist. So much of his worldview is clouded by how women "get over on men", not saying what he says is objectionably wrong, but still VERY blown out of proportion. 

Also he seems to follow the worldview that nobody should ever be offended by anything ever. Which seems dumb to me...How autistic do you have to be to ask that question?

&gt;yeah, you know? I would have shot him for doing that.

What a fucking imbecile you are

&gt;just trying to find more views on this question which literally only has two answers.Yeah that was my first thought.Hey that sounds like something that's not league. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)I think it’s pretty laid out how stupid you are already.

XDYou know, a huge part of being a normal functioning human is being able to empathize with other people.

When you ask a question which has only a yes or no answer and you’re unable to fathom the lines which are alternative to yours you come off as someone who’s a dumbfuck or a psychopath.

Is that good?This is really sad :(. Why did mom and dad have to get a divorce??? You’re asking for more points to a question that has two answers.

It’s either yes or no. It should be plainly obvious how stupid most people think you are.

You were literally begging the question and now you come up with this milquetoast, soccer momesque attempt at portraying yourself as an open and logical person to a cop gunning down an unarmed man.That’s funny because most people probably can’t tell if you’re human or not.

I guess you should be so lucky that other people were oh so kind as to tell you how to be a person.Can you prove it’s NOT his birthday?His birth certificate says it’s today.&gt;he wasnt sent nathan’s birth certificate from destiny himself

Really showed off his intellect Thanks a lot for the detailed reply! I wasn't expecting to learn this much haha.


As I was reading SailOfIgnorance and your replies, I realized that I was wrongly taking a meta perspective in a superhuman sort of mind, i.e. when I referred to my "bigger picture" perspective, I was considering the situation as another person asking what P(A and B|A) is.

The only thing I'm a little confused about is:
&gt; wrong, the probability of heads was 1/2, but the probability of heads is 1.

It's 1 because you know that it **happened**, but if you ask what the probability of *another* flip is, it's 1/2 because of your proof.
Is this the correct train of thought?

I don't know if Destiny understands this or not, as I have only heard him ask the question (crit question), never talk about the answer.  
I wouldn't be too critical of him (unless he's taken a statistics course) because although the conclusion was kind of intuitive, it was difficult to reach without someone who fully understands the situation. I've never taken a statistics course but now I'm fairly interested.In what way though?Ehh, she still makes for good content with Destiny and I kinda like her. I don't think she's racist, but her fangirling over Cumia is tragic. As far as being a conservative, I don't know. I mean she lives in Seattle, how conservative can you really be?If anything is going to burn bridges between Destiny and her it's fucking retards like you throwing around the "legitimately racist" label like it's a fact after only a limited exposure to her views.As far as I know just Tiger Lilly was crazy Why not both? I took it as religious people don't manipulate old people for money, which I think they certainly do. What I mean is, conservative in the north east or north west is probably on average not as conservative as in the deep south. Holy fuckstiny &gt;It also allows people to pay more if they want

I'm not sure what you're saying here. If an ISP bumps the speed of certain content up or down, how is that the people's choice?

&amp;nbsp;

This "case to case system" is the best argument I've heard, but I feel like it's not very strong compared to the other side, even if you gave the FCC the benefit of the doubt.Huh?  
Assuming what you said on the internet's architecture is true, how is NN making people's internet slow? Is your internet right now slow/dissatisfying?

What is "true NN?"1) What kinds of innovation are being hampered by NN?

2) One of us is misunderstanding the situation here. If you want 4k video, **_you_** need to pay for that bandwidth. How are ISP's on the losing end here? If there are hardware improvements you can make to your company for better quality content, why not go with them if it makes you a profit?

3) What is a situation that has a last mile issue blocking competition for ISP's and how does NN affect it? Maybe I'm unfamiliar with the problem, but I feel like this isn't true.

4) I don't understand the argument against NN here. Could you elaborate?The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when Destiny needed them to, to fight the battles that Destiny never could.I feel like this is the dude who doxxed destiny last night and is mad he got the ban hammer. Lmao get fucked cucker. I'm not sure what you're exactly saying.

DIA allows you to receive whatever amount of service you pay for 100% of the time. It's expensive af, but the option is there.

Are you saying that NN doesn't allow new infrastructure to provide a cheaper option? Could you please elaborate?Thanks for this!Thanks for clearing that up.  
How will the repeal of NN address this issue? If you get to the point where Netflix takes up so much bandwidth, isn't the only solution upgrading hardware? How does NN contradict with this solution?Or he could be friendzoned. Nothing they said is really convincing as to why this is a satire.

Basically they just explained why it's glamorizing fascism, and then that is their argument for why it is satire. I don't really see how that follows.

When I was a kid I really loved the cartoon series. The guy even says that it's fucked up they they sold kids toys for it.

Honestly I came away from this review liking the movie less than I did before.Japan is fucking awful what are you talking about? One of the highest rates of suicide, an aging population, negative birth rates, etc. I sure as fuck don't want the US to be like Japan. Well then, RIP friendo I found it weird that this dude was trying to get destiny to talk about his past abuses. I'm not sure if he was genuinely concerned or trying to use it against him in his argument. Add me, I have the same name on Discord1) I still don't know what kinds of innovation are being stifled by NN.

2) I mean, ISPs are rich and are going to stay that way. If the cost of upgrade isn't worth the potential profit, why should NN be repealed for this reason? If everyone was watching 8k video at the same time, how would repealing NN help this situation?

3) What's one way this can be fixed without NN?

4) Aren't you arguing the opposite in #2? ISPs have the option of fiber optic, a lot of which is black, but aren't connecting the last mile (I think Harkdan/Destiny talked about it). If the fiber optics were subsidized to all over the country and aren't being used for the most part, isn't that all on the ISPs?I believe the conversation between optionselect and xskillsme addressed a lot of this, with Harkdan and someone else adding their insight at the end. How does NN work against peering agreements?  
Isn't saying "without NN, prices will drop" a very optimistic belief? I think Harkdan explained that companies have shown desire to abuse the privileges of no NN, so it's very likely that costs will rise if ISPs are allowed to discriminate against data.Did you think about doing words within a close levenshtein distance of your keywords? 100% with this. I wish more people who cover the news on youtube were like him.I like Ali, Faisal, Eiynah, Sarah Haider, Maryam Namazie, and Maajid Nawaz. The last time I saw a discussion about Philip DeFranco on this subreddit you said that if you watch him you have "shit for brains". You then cited a SourceFed video (which he hasn't been a part of for years), rather than any video by him. I [responded](https://imgur.com/8VdKdVC) to your comment, assuming that you had mistakenly mischaracterized him due to that one experience but it seems like you didn't really take anything from that. Now you have basically groundlessly conjectured that he doesn't have fact checkers, which is odd to me because he does - and I feel like in making a guide on good news sources you should have researched this (especially when your inaccuracy has been pointed out to you). I assume you're not willfully trying to skew the truth so can you cite any egregious editorial mistakes he's made in the past few years?

Full disclosure, I'm a fan and I've been watching him for about 2.5 years and most of his presentation of the news seems okay to me, although I recognize that perhaps I didn't notice mistakes (so feel free to point them out)I personally see it as listening to someone who has ready *many* news articles (which is what he and his research team do). I'd agree with you if the quality wasn't good but he links his sources in the description and any time I follow them his representation has been fairly decent. He's certainly not a *journalist*, but as at least a curator of the news I can't think of any huge issues if you want a fairly good idea of things except for his occasional anti-MSM slant. Perhaps you're aware of an issue I didn't consider?There are few videos on youtube that attempt to take apart Shapiro that doesn't get downvoted a fuckton. Don't the CDC like give recommendations on food and diseases? Aren't they supposed to be science-based (or evidence-based)?

It's worrying that these words have to be used more but you gotta start in the other end – if Trump stopped disputing evidence-based science based on nothing but feelings and lies people wouldn't have to use these now banned words as much. Yeah dude, the whole meme about being in a interracial relationship, and “white guilt” was pretty weird.I interpreted it as the latter.Richard Lewis is like a stupider version of Ian Ching-Chong if that is even possible.how are theyMy pee pee tells me she is attractive, but my white genes aren't allowing me to want to date her. discord was a mistakeI've seen them I just don't like them Legit Wholesome picture You also have to remember while the anti sjws control youtube the left has shows on tv like John Oliver who has a much bigger audience None of the things you mentioned are egregious editorial mistakes, or even editorial mistakes at all - they're style-related. Would you be able to point me to any that he's made in the past few years? I'm sincere in saying that I'll easily stop being a fan of him if he's been inaccurate to the extent that /u/4THOT seems to be asserting

I don't care as much about style but I'll address your points anyway I guess. I'm sure you could find an example of him reading out headlines but I would contend that isn't true overall (feel free to show me a video where he does that a lot). I was under the impression that this guide was about getting politically informed and it seems fairly efficient to be able to get a summary of the day's new in 15 min with further reading links if you want. Idc about his opinions or what he's "really thinking" tbh, I don't get my opinions from him

&gt;Nuff said.

Damn you got me[That's Alot of Science.](https://i.imgur.com/nsIW85C.png)&gt;Lilypichu is great, but honestly, she's just another typical loli fanservice archetype

Agreed, Loli-pikachu is such a flat character, the writers really need to put more effort in character development if they ever want to compete in the marketplace of ideas. Mr. Mouton is trash, but at least he can dance.??? Did you maybe mistakenly respond to the wrong person? [Here's](https://imgur.com/eWHyXco) the comment thread that you joined, maybe you misunderstood my comment? If I confused you, let me be clear: *I'm mostly concernend with editorial mistakes*

Just to humour you I decided to check his [latest video](https://youtu.be/o9TIR7pLv7s) to see how much time he spends on opinion 

* 0:00-0:17 - intro
* 0:17-1:30 - Indian couple acid story
* 1:30-1:50 - opinion
* 1:50-2:30 - Dr. Disrespect story
* 2:30-2:56 - why he included this story
* 2:56-3:55 - Morgan Spurlock story
* 3:55-4:19 - people's reactions, opinion, what are your thoughts
* 4:19-5:53 - Harvey Weinstein/Salma Hayek
* 5:53-6:43 - opinion
* 6:43-8:47 - Rohingya
* 8:47-9:15 - "opinion" (although throughout this he gives *more* info on the story by talking about what other countries/UN have done about Rohingya)
* 9:15-9:39 - Patreon story
* 9:39-10:05 - side note about DeFrancoElite
* 10:05-10:58 - resuming Patreon story
* 10:58-12:34 - opinion, outro

totalling up the non-story stuff (and including the 8:47-9:15 section), total time is 3:37 out of a 12:34 video, which is personally acceptable. if you wanna find a video that's mostly opinion or you disagree with how I broke down the vid, feel free to let me know, BUT *I'm more concerned with the inaccuracies*I watched the daily show in high school lolI have a trial but it kills my battery Seriously...Blaire seem sweet? Most people’s who come in contact with her can’t atand herThe whole there are no good candidates thing is a load of shit. People Vote against thier own interests because we are selfish. Or in the case of trump racist.If that’s the case then so should every trump supporters, but thankfully that’s not how it worksSo people are either niave or hide thier true intentions Just because you call yourself not racist it does t make it trueI got through most of it but there is that sentiment in the video correct? Maybe I misunderstood You can tell Lauren southern came into the debate doing no research because she actually thinks she is so much smarter than everyone. She moved the goal posts every time destiny said something. It was greatAnyone have the clip of him quitting? I didn't watch the stream todayMaybe I remember it differently. I’m gonna rewatch it, maybe it’s just because I don’t like vegan gains that muchWhat was that one about?I can’t believe people watch this guy seriously. Also I hate how smug he is after every sentence, that stupid fucking face is the worstHis winder Woman one is gold. I don’t think he actually watched the movieA once a week sc2 stream, even for just a few hours, would be fucking amazing. nah sorry that was MrWhiteRaven, I think you meant to reply to him, instead of me over and over againSo he went back and lowered the difficulty huh?

Edit: I just realized that's exactly what the viewer asked for lol. I thought I saw him take damage so I assumed he lowered it. I'm hopeful we will get more memes. It depend on the context of each election and people very often use both sides are the same as a lazy excuse not to vote. I just disagree with that specific thingWatching it now and wow he is the most dishonest person to debate with Nick is such a slimy person it’s gross. Some one like Jon tron is just an idiot who actually knows nothing but nick is intentionally dishonest about everythingI hope Jon Troy gets dragged into this some how, it would make it betterHoly shit lmaoi'm still waiting for /u/4THOT to cite any example of him making a huge editorial mistake in the last few yearsif you remember I'd like to knowawesome thanks!the thing is that shkreli has literally nothing to lose except his wu tang album (rip in pepperoni's) - this politician is on his way to form his own party and gain seats in the dutch government Oh hey I finally got a response. It's okay man, I just needed *one* example. 

If that's too much to ask can you at least admit
 
1. [The last example you used to call DeFranco inaccurate wasn't even a DeFranco video](https://imgur.com/8VdKdVC) (see [**this**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SourceFed#Under_Discovery_and_Revision3))

2. [It's irresponsible to not *fact-check* a statement about whether or not someone has *fact-checkers* when you're making a guide to being politically informed and your ranking basis is *fact-checking*](https://imgur.com/u7ylg4P)

I understand it's troublesome to rifle through lots of content so if you do admit to the first point, do you still unequivocally hold the same opinion that DeFranco makes egregious editorial mistakes? If so I'll just take your word for it and look into it myself. I wanna be as fair to you as possible but you're not making it easy by ignoring me/telling me to fuck offSweet thanks. So will you admit that this is not a DeFranco video? (again, see [**this**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SourceFed#Under_Discovery_and_Revision3)). Those links are helpful but I really wish you actually responded to any of the three questions I asked :/ Would you say The Philip DeFranco Show in its recent iteration makes egregious editorial mistakes? Sargon stepping up the production but not the actual content. Just what he neededCompletely unrelated but you are one of my favorite commenters on this subAnyone who pays for this is an idiot People just can’t stamd woman doing things is what it comes down tooIs it because she rags on woman all the time for playing victim then uses being a woman as way to play victim? Because that irks me. Sargon still annoys me way more, he genuinely seems stupid. He is racist and sexist because he is just stupid, Lauren and others seem more malicious purposely. Sargon and no bullshit just seem like they are too stupid to understand even the most basic shitThe only people I see calling her a Mary Sue are skeptics like Sargon. And they definitely have an issue with Woman When he talked to destiny he just reeeeee’d for an hourIf you are gonna cut taxes just cut taxes, what ever. But no they add in a ton if other shit that helps the non working rich and hurts young college studentsIt's particularly infuriating listening to Scott Adams describe Trumps buzzword spewing as leadership, when it was Scott Adams' pointy haired Boss where I first learned about how useless that sort of "leadership" without substance is.

Like, have I just been mis-reading it the whole time? Is the pointy haired boss really the protagonist? The engineers are the joke because they don't understand the quality leadership?

It's almost impossible to take his perspective on Trump seriously, given the context he has himself created."Leadership and bamboozle is the same thing, just one is when you are against the direction you are leading." Cx
What’s with white nationalists and fucked up haircuts He wasn’t racist enough and all the skeptics attacked him. That’s really it[](/DuckerZ) [](/DuckerZ) [](/DuckerZ) [](/DuckerZ) [](/DuckerZ) [](/DuckerZ) [](/DuckerZ) [](/DuckerZ) [](/DuckerZ) [](/DuckerZ) [](/DuckerZ) [](/DuckerZ) [](/DuckerZ) [](/DuckerZ) [](/DuckerZ) [](/DuckerZ) [](/DuckerZ) [](/DuckerZ) [](/DuckerZ) [](/DuckerZ) [](/DuckerZ) [](/DuckerZ) Enlightened contrarian centrist skeptic btwShattering the patriarchy by taking money from nerds and giving it to [this guy](https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/1457613341.jpg). WRONG. USA has best healthcare in the world, but also best marksmanship. That's the only reason Americans lead short, productive, healthy lives instead of wondering around not getting shot like a scandi.I doubt most people actually took the time to watch the video. The video is fine, he just talks about his on perspective and experience with Sexism in the esports industry when it comes to talent. He spend a good 15mins in the start qualifying what he means by certain terms like Sexism, Feminism etc. It's a decent video, a lot of fluff and personal experience but yeah. My read on Buntyking is that he is trying to be persuasive towards white nationalists, and people sympathetic towards white nationalists.

That is one issue he is pretty consistent on. I don't think he is trying to stoke up that kind of sentiment, but he tries to make his content not jarring for people that have those sorts of views.

Sort of like how Scott Adams comes out the gate and says he is "more left than Bernie Sanders". I think it's more a persuasive tactic than any kind of expression about what he really thinks.

It is a time for snakes and weasels, and if there is any meaning in it at all it is hidden in between the memes.The all men people usually are terfs most the time, who don’t get along with most people who identify as feminists for that very reason. Also they are insanely transphobic It started around the same time as the war on Christmas god damn it my dudeI didn’t say that at allNever said that I just said the all men people are usually terfs who aren’t very well liked Because in this situation it is terfs and misandrists who do say that seriously. As some one who is a feminist and activist I think I would know who the toxic people in my own movement are.Didn’t say there weren’t but they go hand in hand. The misandry is what leads to rejection of trans woman. So if someone says all men are rapists and are truly serious they are more than likely a terf or on their way to becoming one. How the fuck did Andy Warski get an audience talking about this stuff? He comes off about as intelligent as ice posideon. [](/LUL)He didn't, as far as we know. He posted a huge facebook post explaining why he left. Him being kicked out is nothing but baseless speculation as far as I'm aware.Holy shit that was something. There is no one more slimes than nickdamn so close to top 5 and yet so far - but the top 5 were all amazing so honestly understandable

loved hearing all these entries &lt;3The amount of cunning that it would take to move JF from viewing everything from the perspective of purely evolutionary biology is impossible from anyone I have seen on the left, including senpaiglad you liked it man!I'm going to be a bit disappointed if Destiny cowers away from this debate. This is essentially what he shits on other people for doing: Talking shit on twitter, and then not being able to step up to a live conversation.

[Especially spicy since he accused someone of this HOURS after doing it himself:](https://twitter.com/OmniDestiny/status/945139361410174976)

&gt;"Heyo, I know people like you disappear as soon as someone actually challenges you, but I really want an honest answer here, please try not to run -"

[](/HmmStiny)He did claim JF completely butchered the nurture vs nature argument. Apparently Destiny thinks he knows something JF doesn't know, or doesn't care to fully articulate. This would be the starting point of the debate.Then why do leftist almost never want to acknowledge it? Why is it that as soon as someone talks about the question, they're immediately called a white supremacist, because this is apparently the only conclusion in their mind when someone talks about the difference of races. 

Don't you think it's possible this behavior enforces the idea that this is actually what leftists believe? Then what you get is a viscous cycle of leftists shutting down the race question because only racists would talk about it -&gt; People misunderstand this as denying there are any racial differences -&gt; Said people become angry with leftists for denying truth -&gt; Leftists also accuse those people of being racists.

Stop calling people racists, stop attributing intent to people talking about race, and start being clear about what is true, and you'll instantly win over all the fence sitters who are confused because they don't know what the fuck you're even talking about.I appreciate that my dude, I'm sure I willEvolution's program is pretty open ended.

Continuing to exist is the program, but that means something very different for a human than it does a liver fluke.

I don't think it's possible to reject it. You may reject the moral value of continuing to exist, but your rejection will be forgotten because something will continue to exist and if you don't care to it won't be you.

However, I don't think that traps you into a "dishonorable program" so to speak. Existing as a human is very special, and morality or honor so to speak is the expression of the special nature of existing as a human.My point is that the task of effectively replicating fundamentally changes depending on what it is that is replicating.

For example if something very flammable was replicating, and fires were not uncommon, the best way to replicate would need to take that into consideration.

Replicating might be the evolutionary program for many things, but the best way to go about that depends on what the things are. Just to say we share an evolutionary program with a liver fluke doesn't mean the best way for humans to execute that program is also the best way for a liver fluke.Even if they are right, which they aren’t, what do they propose we do about it? Like no matter what it ends in genocide with race realistsLOL BadBunny @ anything above Shit TierExactly, like you don’t have to address thier science it’s much more telling to address what happens afterYeah it’s the easiest way to get people to turn on them. Show people thier true intentions Are you trying to seduce me or something?idk what to make of this JF guy. I don't respect him or his arguments for the simple fact that he has a PhD like most people on the alt-right, he seems autistic because literally every argument he makes comes down to some type of semantic trickery, or methologically sound reasoning that leads to an incredibly dumb argument that is only notable for how dumb or absurd it is. 

To me he either is a motivated reasoner, or someone who sticks around the alt right because they stroke his ego

I need to dig more into his content to really understand, but that is how it appears to me&gt;Not trolling or trying to be a prick, but have you at least considered that perhaps there are some topics the left shies away from debate on because they would probably lose?


Ascribing win or lose to a debate means almost nothing to me, and other people lose(despite the memes)

why? Because online debating is cancer really, it's entertaining, but it takes an enormous effort on the viewer to establish the validity of each sides respective arguments.

So with this in mind, the alt right has succintly used this opprotunity(not like some grand conspiracy), but moreso just how there culture has developed, to gain traction. Rather than worry about the validity or soundness of there arguments. The alt-right just throw together a hodge-podge of sources, articles, and shoe string reasoning, put a bow on it and enter the online arena and can appear to win by constantly having something to say, having MORE evidence, and seeming better prepared.

If you want a good example of what I am talking about, watch the naked ape vs kraut and tea debate on race realism

LoLNatsumiiiHow do you have such good taste Wait, what if my Dad came into the country legally through the Bracero program, and just stayed. While Reagan giving him permanent residence here, and then later bring my mom over here into the U.S. and marrying her. Also allowing my mom to take and pass her U.S. citizenship test, and later having me, a mestizo, which is basically Funky Fuentes without the high percentage of white spirit, being born here in 'Merica. Do I still get sent to the death camps or do I get the nice $20 gift card for living in Mexico?Full paper for anyone interested http://weis2017.econinfosec.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/05/WEIS_2017_paper_21.pdfRace realists so stupid. By their logic Jews and Asians are the smartest and blacks are the most athletic. So that means white people are just the most mediocre. Funny how if you choose to believe that nonsense white dudes end up being the least impressive. It’s funny because the ones pushing it are the most mediocre of the races if you believe in this race realism bullshitSo let’s say race realists are right(they aren’t) what should we do with that information?Really wish Steven would challenge Phil to Street Fighter, even though he says he can't play fighting games I feel like he'd still win.Okay but only white nationalists are pushing this “theory” like its fact. Just look at who is supporting it on YouTube. Well race is a cultural and societal construct and concept so it doesn’t even make sense you can pin point differences between them. All these youtubers talk about the white race but what even is the white race. The reason there are no rebuttals is because it’s like trying to prove god isn’t real. You can’t disprove something that has no evidence it exists in the first place. If you want to talk about the differences between races you gotta prove race exists outside of culture, which you can’t. Nah you got nothing that scientifically proves anythingIt does matter if you are peddling race realism as science lmao. Fucking moronYeah it does when people are trying to use hard science to prove “races” are different.Jesus someone wrote that. Even for a troll that’s bad. Because assholes don’t understand how to do both at once.No, she is comparing hitler to sjws dont misconstrue her words reeeeYou know I'm surprised that hasn't happened yet. Those two haven't interacted as far as I know until a few days ago on Twitter. But they both seemingly operate in the same circles, but their paths haven't really crossed.Both seemed to advocate for an ethnostate, which is not achievable unless for ethnic cleansing. "Incentivizing" people to leave is a pipe dream not supported by history. 40% of the Jews in Germany stayed even after the Machtergreifung, the Nuremberg Laws and the Kristallnacht. Okay, and how do you get rid of all the non-white people already in the country? They agree it’s a social concept but they think you can apply science to a social concept I'm not particularly familiar with how Poland or Hungary handle their minorities. The Destiny vs. JF debate was about the US, and whether you tighten up immigration laws or not, explain to me where the millions of Asians, Hispanics and black people go if the US were to become an ethnostate. I doubt Poland is comparable to the US in that regard.I've got my doubts 50 people would even bother visiting that discord. Species isn’t a social construct lmaoIn biology, a species is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. It’s literally biology you boobFor your sake I hope you are trollingI wanted to die when he said, “This was about love.”This might be the best meme of 2018. And we haven't even started yet. Anyone who takes baths for hygiene is an objectively wrong subhuman piece of autistic trash. Don't @ me. You're an actual retard if you think that's what the debate / issue were about. Maybe you have the mental fortitude to date this girl🤔. Kindly and quietly kill yourself please. Agree completely. I personally know a girl with (what sounds like) a very similar mental disability as the girl mentioned. The crux of the issue seems to be Andy's lack of understanding of what the mental disability entails. He seems jaded by his own prior experience to understand the moral consent issues presented.  

This is further evidenced by the fact that he keeps using the word "slow" for the girl in question. For someone with the mental age of 10, slow is not the issue at all. The girl I know in my close family, yes she can be slow, the issue is coercion and the complete reliance upon others. She can be coached into certain behavior very easily, she can be taught the right/wrongs of certain behavior very easily and she can be manipulated in such by those people. She has no situational awareness and contextual knowledge to apply to any situation, she gives only simple answers and watched the world in a very simple way, as you would expect from a child. I am not defending JF. I don't like the guy. I just don't believe he is a sexual predatorIs there video context for this? You seem to think I am defending JF. Which I am not. Everything he does is fishy to me, it just doesn't surprise me someone whose primary lense for evaluating things from a biological perspective, particularly evolutionary biology, would be willing to have a relationship with a 19 yr old girl.

Sexual predation has the connotation that you are trying to take advantage of her. He undoubtedly DID take advantage of her but that didn't seem to be his intention. His intention seemed to be to sleep with a 19 yr old.Did she have a drivers license? They said drove, but I assumed it was public transport etc. If it was herself driving then I have no clue. I could never imagine my friend driving herself. He doesn't. He's just using them as much as he can.If a full-blooded WASP has 1 soul and a Mexican has 2/3 of a soul then I would say that a Québécois has a 5 soul deficit. TIL sex with a 19-year-old adult = child molestationTIL 18-year-old = prepubescent child

19-year-old = pubescent child

Thanks, Destiny!I think you missed the point. You are jumping to a lot of conclusions. She criticized the alt right and far left here and seemed pretty reasonable.

Wait for part 2. Also contra loves decadence and the benefits of capitalismInb4 the other two turn on Brittany 

Edit: Nope they're all retards He's enjoying it because he knows they're dumb as shitbrb subscribing to SargonPretty sure he doesn't shower, but I'd still give him a big ol' smooch. Honestly, it's really impressive. He just is really quick on his feet and keeps calm even in the face of this spergling mouth breath autist. Beautiful As someone who used to main as a healer in WoW, this is some PTSD-inducing shit.https://www.twitch.tv/videos/213943480?t=06h07m06sOh, sure, yeah he was around for quite a while. Not sure on that timestamp, maybe i'll find it later.&gt; AND HE TRIED TO IMPREGNATE THEM AFTER ONLY PHYSICALLY KNOWING THEM FOR THREE WEEKS.

Six months.

&gt; Man they'd destroy him as a predator pedo.

Truly, fucking a 19-year-old is child molestation.

&gt; And he got her half his age ...

See above.
He said six months. You're making shit up.

You forgot how you nagged at him over age. Pedo? The girl's 19 and he's immediately a pedo? What country do you live in? You've failed to address my sarcasm.&gt; AND HE TRIED TO IMPREGNATE THEM AFTER ONLY PHYSICALLY KNOWING THEM FOR THREE WEEKS.

Six months.

&gt; HE'S FUCKING 32 AND MARRIED THREE TIMES.

And?

&gt; And he got her half his age ...

Truly, fucking a 19-year-old girl is child molestation.

&gt; Man they'd destroy him as a predator pedo.

See above. What idiot would believe that sex with a 19-year-old is pedophilia? Destiny and his fans. Clearly.But you asshats keep focusing on the fact that he's dating a 19-year-old and has a previous history of marriages.Destiny is hyper against circumcision, so I doubt he is. That being said, delete this weird ass question, nephew. Lol, I need a vacation from the other place. Ah, cool. Thanks. i'll skip this one then when it hits my yt sub box, thank you for the summary and saving me from some retardation. &gt;How in the ever-loving fuck do you propose doing a twin study where one twin is black and one twin is white?

You dont. The way you would do it is to compare *sets of twins* of different races.

&gt;This probably isn't news to anyone.

It would be to virtually every alt righter that use the twin studies as some kind of evidence that backs are genetically inferior to whites when it comes to intelligence.
Lol, pretty much.I research their effects on human consciousness.Wait I missed it what happened?Thanks buddy.Did you also know that he doesn't have a college degree?I'm sure Gary will have the chaos on YT soon. Idk where to even begin. So is anyone team destiny or is it him against all of them Asmongold comes in a few hours in to be a person of a reason. He ends up defending destiny a fair bit, but he remained neutral and rational the whole time. Thank you for that it’s hard to keep up with all thisIt's anti science quackery. I wouldn't say I "learned" this becuase I already knew it was true, but they've  helped me gain a more intuitive understanding of how the self is an illusion.Feyerbend is a guy that puts astrology and creationism on the same footing as anything that can be discovered using the scientific method. He's a total quack and virtually no onein the philosophy of science take his ideas seriously anymore.&gt;Uhh... You realize this helps JF more than it hurts him.

Surely you are joking? 

&gt;Sooo you're saying that the more money and resources you have, the MORE heritable your IQ is, and this defeats JF's hypothesis. 

No, I'm saying that JF is either unaware of what the twin studies *actually* show, or that he conveniently forgot to mention this because it is detrimental to his hypothesis that heritability is the cause of the IQ discrepancies between blacks and whites.

&gt;D-U-H. NO ONE is saying that socioeconomic status doesn't affect IQ, and barely anyone is saying these effects are trivial.

You don't even understand this study. The study is not measuring the effect of socioeconomic status on IQ, it's measuring the effect the socioeconomic status has on the *heritability* of IQ.




Doesn't he also want parents to rape their children or something?I think that's pretty well put. &gt;The studies he refers to controls for socio-economic status.

But he completely fails to mention this fact or the result of said controls. This is becuase they *hurt* his hypothesis that blacks are genetically prone to lower IQ scores than whites. &gt;This is becuase they hurt his hypothesis that blacks are **genetically** prone to lower IQ scores than whites.

This is an exact quote.I would also point out that JF is himself anti peer review. Can you imagine that? A scientist that is anti peer review? 

It might have something to do with the fact that he wrote a book on a theory of abiogenesis even though he has no background in molecular biology, nor did he put any of his theories to the test through peer review. And according to a few molecular biologists I've spoken to, it's absolutely horseshit. Not an argument. What problems exactly  have you sloved?For those of you who didn't have to witness this shit live, good luck, my dudes. You're gonna need it. Ah mybbad. I'm very drunk and a bit autistic.&gt;I lost all respect after he called Destiny a Jew and said that he simply wants to prevent him from having a white reproductive "family".

Oh jesus, when was this?Are you against asking questions bro? What are trying to hide?

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=elRxbGJuCw8It literally doesn't. The environment has an effect on the heritability of a whole host of phenotypes from bone density to height and includes IQ as is demostransted by twin studies. 

What vidoeo was that on?. Here you go, pal:

https://youtu.be/-cgGjJpAbal68?t=14095I mean.... are you a furry? I thought his response was a copypasta or something Even without RTBA and with bombjin the D.gg chat will always be superior. Leave twitch fag REEEEEFirstly I'm pretty sure he never said that it was totally okay. If I remember correctly he said "it's never something I would do, it just seems kind of unnecessary, but I wouldn't really care if someone did it." Secondly, I'm pretty sure 99% of us don't agree with Destiny's autistic ass stance on veganism and animals. Much like most of us disagree with him on property rights memes. That doesn't mean that we are gonna character assassinate him over stupid shit. Threatening the kid was pretty bad, but I at least understand how frustrated he must have been. And the sending clothed pics of a 15 year old was irresponsible at worst, but people like to overblow dumb shit. I feel like Destiny is generally not a role model in his personal life, and I think even he would admit that. I'd say the last two hours are the spiciest, but you need the first four hours to get all the memes. Feelsbadman I, for one, accept our new Bombjin overlord Wait, I could have sworn that in the beginning part of the vid, Destiny was asked if he had banned all the people who was involved with the grooming thing. He said that he only banned some of them, not all. I’m curious if there was anything else to this story. It seems to me the minor details of it makes him look a bit shitty but overall it’s not as bad as people make it out to be.That's not what methodological pluralism means in this sense though. It means "plural" as in addition to the scientific method. While there are different methodologies used in different sciences, they are all united by the fact that they must make testable and falsifiable theories.Yeah I would agree.&gt;But he downplayed the idea that theories are still compared with one another primarily for their ability to account for the results of observation and experiment

That is exactly what science does. We make observations, then we come up with theories that explain the the observations, then we make testable predictions and run experiments to falsify said predictions. If you aren't doing this, you aren't doing science period. It might be art, or fiction or mythology or whatever, but it's not science. 
It depends what you mean by the social sciences. If you mean gather statistics and yes, coming up with theories, then of course this is science. If you mean something like critical theory, queer theory, marxism, oor post structuraliam, then this is most definitely not science. You're a fucking retard, he says "a breakdown of crime by race and socioeconomic status doesn't exist" which it doesnt. They're two separate stats. One of them together (like in the picture) doesn't exist. &gt;Focusing on science as necessarily setting up experiments

Did I say it was about necessarily about expirments? If I did, that was a poor choice of word. I should have said it was about making falsifiable predictions. Paleontologists and astronomers aren't setting up experiments, but they are definitely sciences becuase they make observations and form theories with falsifiable predictions.Andy should probably off himself Is this your permanent  home now?It would still be incredibly irresponsible even if she were just a normal 19 year old, but I agree you that the major problem is that she had the mental capacity of a 10-11 year old.Yes, I love my stories with a curved symmetrical structure!The mind is the only the only thing that matters as when it comes to concent.  JF   raw dogged a virgin with the mind of a 10 year old child he barely even knew. Destiny shared a perfectly legal photo of a teenager. There is absolutely no comparison between the two. Oh jesus. You know your life is rough shape when you go from the prestige of doing neuroscience research, to relying on handouts from Andy fucking Warski. &gt;Also, the it's the ability to make choices knowing the repercussions of those actions that makes up consent. 

And what would we call the aparatus that we use to make such choices?

&gt;I don't really follow JF other than when he was on Drunken Peasants, but I distinctly remember him saying he dated her for quite sometime.

He'd known her for mere months online and convinced her to move in with him and away from her family. He then raw dogged her immediately after meeting her in person with the explicit intention of impregnating her.

&gt;That's why we have laws that protect teenagers in this way.

Actually we dont, it's perfectly legal. Infact it's even seen in catalogs and fashion magazinees and advertising throughout the world every single day. However, I would agree that what destiny did probably wasn't showing the best judgment, but it's far from illegal. 

&gt; Is sexualizing an adult with a child's mind worse or better than sexualizing a child? 

That is absolutely not the correct comparison to be made. The correct comparison would be trying to impregnate a 19 year old with the mind of a 10 year vs sharing a photo of a 15 year in a bathing suit. 

As far as I'm aware, JF's girlfriend didn't need someone to clean and diaper her.

Well, the court appointment her with a lifetime legal gurdian. Also, I love how you immediately change the qualifier from mere self sufficiency,  to requiring someone to change her diapers. Slick move.











All right, how did this imbecile get so big that he gets to invite people like Spencer? I had never heard of him before the Destiny debates a couple of days ago.I feel like you are jumping to conclusions a bit. Also I don’t understand where your taxation leads to job loss comes from. Contra never suggested more taxes. You keep saying what you think contra instead of actually listening to what contra meansSarkeesian? I mean he only followed him for like 4 days or whatever?I started listening to her new podcast and it turns out she isn’t trying to ruin everything and is a pretty funny person Yeah exactly lol. Gamer gate is the reason I’m a feminist now, the over reaction to her was fucked upI wonder if that's what happened to me 🤔I'm willing to give Steven the benefit of the doubt on this one. He corrected himself within the minute I think and also offered to have them look through the pastbin. I do believe him when he says he simply didn't remember something that happened in 2012. &gt;Because 'mental age' is a soft science. You know whats a hard science? Big numbers?

Of course it's an estimate based on averages. But so is something like carbon 14 dating. 

And I have absolutely no idea what you mean about "hard science" being "big  numbers". You are going to have to come up with something a little less vague and try again.

Lol, he's actually really stupid like Trump in this way. He just seems to go along with whatever point the last person he hears talking was espousing.Ya, it seems like to a lot of these people if you are over 18, anything and everything is fair game. But the minute that you admit that teenagers under the age of 18 can be sexually attractive, it's instant "pedo".Ya, he's a total quack. &gt; the people he's clinging to now are ones that helped expose the "docs" server or whatever, I've never seen any evidence that she is attending university.I completely agree. It's fascinating how so many seem people lack the ability to to be introspective on their own moral intuitions and instead go with their instant gut reaction.  

Although progress on these issues is definitely possible. Just look at how many people ten or twenty years ago would have been oposed to gay rights compared with today.The perspective of some people is focused on what people are, not what they should be.

If people are grotesque animals that drive each other to suicide, then that is what they are. It's pretty clear to anyone that is not what people should be.

I think it's a difference in optimism vs pessimism. Some people think people can be what they should be, some people don't.He resigned to write a quick book on abiogenesis becuase the rigors of actual scientific research were too tough of a standard.

I can try and find his resignation letter if you are interested.They are calling him a virgin lol* Destiny tries his Anakin Skywalker cosplay (2nd movie): *"Seriously! Fuck Rey!"*I know it’s wrong but it’s so much fun to make fun of these people. They are just so wrong about everything but so confident Lmao that would be great[[Jazz/Soul] George Benson - Breezin'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14pitnJlcv4)

It's insane, they literally attacked Steven over the use of a C&amp;D on Aydin Paladin, but cheer when JF does it. They have zero self awareness.&gt;"I'm not a jew" [](/LIES)No one should feel bad for Andy, just because he has a slightly lower IQ than most people doesn't give him an excuse to have literal nazis and sexual abusers on his show.This ugly son of a bitch is fucking super hot girls and basically you're a fucking eedeot. How? Clicc here. I want to see Destiny talk with Kyle, TJ Kirk, and Josh Zepps.He was probably having an episode.

It's possible he has recovered partially since then. It's also possible that he has recovered fully, and has since relapsed or something.&gt; There probably is, but nobody has shown that it would be significant under equal environmental conditions.

So you believe that different races have differences in average iq brought on by genetics but the difference is miniscule under a controlled environment?It's almost like the Destiny community lumps all the skeptics into the alt right. [](/HmmStiny)&gt; but this idea of rolling over and ignoring people and them going away is precisely why Trump won.

I know Destiny thinks this too but it's bullshit and I'm actually a little sad Kristi Winters didn't call him out on it. Ignoring fascist talking points is **not** why Trump won or why there's been a **global** push to the right. The Syrian civil war, the refugee crisis, terrorism in Europe and in the US have raised security concern all across the globe. In times of global instability, voting populations tend to vote conservative because of a myriad of reasons. Suggesting that hurting fascist's feelings led to Trump is absolutely bizarre given how many more viable reasons there are to point to. The political landscape in Germany, France, Austria and so forth is *nothing* like the US one and yet, there's been a substantial rightward shift in all of those countries too. Add Russian propaganda and Email-gate and you get a rough picture as to how Trump came about.

Fascists can go fuck themselves. The entire fucking internet is full of hatred. Youtube, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit. How do these cunts lack platforms?Glad to hear it.

https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ChainfuckThis argument is especially lame considering that sargon admittedly uses SJW tactics himself.

Feel free to correct me.[Holy shit...](https://i.imgur.com/Pz0La8C.png)this is an amazing meme&gt;(my personal opinion is that genes probably represent a notable chunk of the cause, but exactly how much is hard to determine, and I expect most biologists would agree with me)

He is purposely ignorant and memey. He wants to come across as innocent and light hearted it’s all an act. The real guy is a truly horrible piece of garbage who always has an agenda. He isn’t smart but he is very manipulative and malicious. I know someone who dealt with him before. He is an opportunist and a horrible personNo baked Alaska knows exactly what he is doing. I know some one who has a run in with him. He is deceptive and manipulative. Destiny should not have talked to him, baked Alaska plays dumb on purpose trust meAs a Canadian, fuck both JF's views AND the stupid hate speech laws.To JF and a MEXICAN mentally disabled girl.

And yes, he was making a half-breed anchor baby.

So yes, the plot doth thicken much... and so does my cock.&gt;Where is the Life we have lost in living?

&gt;The cycles of heaven in twenty centuries  
&gt;Brings us farther from God and nearer to the Dust.  fuck this retard. hes always like xd thanks twitch chat fucking attention whoring dipshit.Okay so this happened the other day. I was watching pokelawls and I randomly saw Mr. Mouton in the chat say some dumb shit, like, "press 1 in the chat if you're a weeb VoHiYo" I @ him and said "fuck you mr mountain". No one else replied to him, no one else saw what he said, I was the only one....and I said fuck you. He responded with, ":(" and when I realized my mistake, I @ him against and said sorry. But he never responded. I'm sorry Mr. Mouton, please forgive me.The confession was that he is giving up on his new years resolution. He's not necessarily justifying any bullying, he's just explaining why he feels the way he does about Mouton, and why other people feeling the same might cause them to bully him. (Now I wouldn't go so far as equating chatters telling him to KYS or fuck off as "bullying", when these are things people say to each other in the dgg community all the time with no malicious intent.)

I'll go further than him and say, if he doesn't like people shitting on him, maybe he shouldn't constantly be as toxic as he is on stream, e.g every single minute do the le cringe bantz with Destiny, always shit on people in chat, never shutting up about the "twitch chat", almost never having anything interesting to say unless it involves some joke insulting someone. If you can't take the heat, don't constantly dish it out every minute of your existence. &gt;I think that I bring a lot to the stream

Such as?&gt;Your comment was legitimately rationalizing bullying someone.

I don't know what exactly you mean by rationalizing here. I am explaining why he gets bullied, and what what he can do to prevent it. I'm not saying bullying MrMouton is okay. But, going back to what I said before, I don't think it's fair for MrMouton to cry about being shit on (again, I don't think it's severe enough to be called bullying), when his entire persona is built on being "ironically" annoying, and rarely makes any attempt to foster interesting or positive interactions with Destiny or chat. If he doesn't understand that it's time someone told him the truth.Can't wait to get excited about all the dope shit I'm going to do with a new nation and then immediately destroy myself because I'm retarded. It's not that you do one specific meme too much. It's that you push the same kind of trash talk-esque jokes almost all the time, which makes you out to be very one dimensional and annoying.

I think a lot of people would be completely fine with you, if you just tone that down a bit. Mix it up with some serious discussion sometimes; show people there is more to you than just bantz and one liner memes.Do you have any examples? Anytime I've listened to Shapiro he seems to be making the most eloquent and logical possible defense of what's ultimately an intellectually bankrupt position. I didn't. The point of the thread is:

&gt;"hey maybe MrMouton doesn't like all the hate he gets, let's chill out."

And to that, all I say is that his behavior to a big extent contributes to the shit he gets. If MrMouton wants to stop the hate he gets, then looking how he presents himself is the first step. Telling people to just "stop" is not going to work.Good argument.This is fucking bullshit, she’s a childish drama queen who came around, actually leeched, and talks shit about Steven’s friend for no reason. Despite what you feel about Mouton, I personally am I fan, this type of shit is just worthless. I really hope Destiny never plays with her again or has her on, let her leech off of NB3 now and his legion of 12 year olds.

By far the worst harem member, and Mouton if you see this, ILY buddy, keep being you.Its not though, she’s a jealous little leech.Steven is reaching Nathan Fielder levels of sociopathic LeRuseing.Moreover, the level of political alienation that occurs merely as a result of environmental factors is appalling. The fact that there are currently 535 Members of Congress and *none* of them are dolphins speaks to a deep and persistent system of discrimination that we need to address if we're going to move forward as a society.Kia banned me thoShe studies for fun, she has no much information she can just pull out when ever she wants. It’s hard to do anything if you are gonna debate herNot exactly. The "why" doesn't really refute that claim.Just like with 4chan every meme gets out of control I know everyone thinks Andy is stupid like Sargon or something. But truthfully I think Andy is very self aware and knows exactly what he is doing when he says shit like thatPlease kill yourself for everyone's sake Andy's one of those guys who's genuinely learned nothing about history or politics.As someone who really hates that word destiny is atleast aware of the shit surrounding it and makes an effort not to say it. I’d rather nit here it but I won’t slam him for saying given his previous statements on the word. We all have bad habits being aware goes a long wayShe ain’t just conservative she is anti trans gender Gay right wingers love herIn what way?But during his debate with JF, Destiny kept placing emphasis on her age rather than her mental capacity or any other factor, and treated her age and his age like he's some child molester or pedophile, over and over again. Does Destiny think that 19 is a child's age?&gt; very young and inexperienced in almost all aspects of life.

That's a highly ignorant, if not patronizing, viewpoint. Explain why, then, the voting age is 18? You're an adult when you're 18, when you graduate high school, the age of you should leave home and be independent.You're also confusing her mental capacity with her technical age. 19 isn't relevant.Creepy how? Makes zero sense. Power dynamic? What power dynamic?There you go. Her technical age shouldn't matter at all. If she was 42 year old yet the other circumstances were the same, it's still wrong considering those, nevermind her age.The ages don't matter. JF's age doesn't matter. JF's marital history doesn't matter. Her technical age doesn't matter. What matters are the other factors.Who gives a shit about what older people think about it? That's their opinion.Okay, no, it's not creepy at all. In fact you're confusing her mental retardation with her technical age.What my age and preferences are is irrelevant. You're treating inter-generational relationships at and above the legal age of consent like it's pedophilia.

From my perspective, it's so blatantly obvious that you Americans are highly puritanical, that senseless violence is way more acceptable than sex.
Fucking a 19-year-old in general isn't wrong. Nor is fucking a 18-year-old. Amazingly, Destiny has convinced his ilk that a 32-year-old having sex with a 19-year-old is creepy/wrong/pedophilia/whatever, ignoring completely all the other factors. That's the point I'm trying to make here. Age has neither bearing or relevance to this when it's within legal age. I doubt anyone here wouldn't bitch so much if the girl was the same age or older than JF or younger than JF but older than 19. Why is 19 equivalent to a baby?It's true. Senseless bloodshed in America, if not in many conservative societies, is seen as far more acceptable, even celebrated, than a nipple on TV.How does it show "women want to do lower paying jobs/raise children"?&gt; you're either socially retarded or a straight creep

You're ignoring the concept of sexual liberty. To label someone doing that as "either socially retarded or a straight creep" is no different than slut shaming.Then why was the age of voting lowered? Why isn't there a grade 13 and up if that's the case?

&gt;A 32 year old fucking a 19 year old isn't equal to pedophilia but it is highly questionable because of the difference in experience, resources, and power.

What if it wasn't that? What if it had to do with one's sexual liberty? Not talking about JF's case, but generally.&gt; So sure, she has lived for 19 years looks like a 19 year old, but she is mentally a child. She IS a child. She is not an adult, she will never reach the mental capacity of an adult.

And that's my point. Her age has no relevance, her mental capacity does. That's what I'm trying to say. Look at all the other guys' reasons as to why they agree with destiny. They're ignoring her mental age and focusing on her technical age. Some of them think that you're still a child when you're 19 in general, confusing THIS GIRL'S mental capacity with the rest of us, who ourselves were once 18-19.
Did you graduate high school at 18?Answer my question. Did you graduate at 18?Answer my question. Did you graduate at 18?There's a huge difference between a 32 fucking a 19-year-old and a 32-year-old fucking a 12-year-old. Which is more iffy? I'm just saying that the other shit outside the age of the girl, the age difference, and JF's marital history, have no relevance or bearing on the matter. All the other factors should be considered, however. I'm coming at this from the angle of sexual liberty.Because you haven't explained your point. I have no idea why you're making this connection. This may always happen to you because of how vaguely you speak. You don't even know if I disagree with you or not, I haven't commented on your stance since I don't really know what it is.The age wasn't wrong, either. My point is that and, yeah, the sex along wasn't wrong. I agree with you. It's just that what JF did was predatory due to factors outside the ages and sex, something others here ignore.Hell, who hasn't had sex at 18 or 19, even earlier? Was it rape or consensual? People forget that they were once young. But that's beside my point. My point was that the age has no relevance nor the sex itself. All other factors outside those are, however, completely relevant.You're not answering for them, you're answering for yourself about your age. Surely every young girl and boy who fantasized about older people sexually are mentally ill. /s

My point is the absurd fixation on the age of the girl and the age difference between them, and trying to make the age itself relevant. The girl was mentally ill, among many other details, are relevant. AGE isn't. Some people prefer older, some younger, some around their own age. Some are monogamous, some polyamorous. That's not my issue. My issue is the stupid focus on the age itself.&gt; Also destiny didn't just bring up her age, this girl had never lived on her own, never had a relationship before, was a virgin and had no friends.

The fact that Destiny brought up her age and went on and on about how she was nineteen and he was older, rather than treat all the other details with the same vigor, is ridiculous and irrelevant, like that was the catalyst. The other details I'm not disputing or denying. I know she was mentally handicapped, I knew she ran away, I know she stayed with him for a period of time and they tried to produce children so that JF would deliver at home. THOSE I'm not denying or questioning. What I am questioning is the relevance of the age of the girl and the age and marital details of JF. These are immaterial.I'm not answering that because my age isn't relevant.The ages are not relevant at all. The rest of the details are.My age isn't relevant in this case.Because your asking an irrelevant question. Why? Did my question about what school you graduated from strike a nerve?The point is her age is irrelevant compared to everything else, compared to all the other details. Are you people retarded or what?I meant to ask if my question about whether you graduated high school at 18 (you in general, not you specifically) struck a nerve with you.Read the thread.I mean you haven't really defended that assertion so I'm not really sure to argue with that. I'd have to know why you think that claim supports your position. It seems like you don't want to explain that though.Well, seems pretty consistent with the idea that natal environment matters. If a family or mother is in a position where they need to adopt away their child, they where probably very stressed and had a more adverse natal environment.

If a family is in a position where they can adopt in a child, they are probably more secure and would provide a more developmentally condusive natal environment.

However if someone is already racist, anything that might be correctly explained by natal environment they will be quick to attribute to genes.

Seems like a good follow up would be to find women who are planning to adopt and take steps to improve their nutrition and reduce their stress during the pregnancy to see how much of the gap can close that way.

I don’t remember but I’m sure they were saying weird stuff about woman I'm not disputing any of that at all. The only thing that's irrelevant has to be the age of the girl and JF. Everything else I'm not disputing.It's not right for him to do that no matter what age he or she is. The age is irrelevant unless she's underage.Reality doesn't care about your feelings buddy.&gt; Is it alright to prey on the naivety of someone much younger than you, and to persuade them to make the permanent life decision of having a child?

The factor wasn't the age. The factor was her mental health, her mental capacity. Age, as I've said many times before, regardless of what you think, is irrelevant. She had the mentality, the mental capacity, of an 11-year-old.&gt; I have no problem with a 32 year old having sexual relations with a 19 year old.

And that we can agree on. 100%.I think your boiled down conclusions at the end are correct, but you are making several assumptions about what the people that subscribe to this ideology think if you think this sort of approach is going to be convincing.

Basically to understand the white nationalist, you need to understand medieval aristocracy (i.e. the current state of Russian society).

There are two main types of person in the white nationalist ecosystem. Serfs and aristocrats. Serfs are people basically losers that want to be judged by their race instead of as an individual, because they don't like to judge themselves as individuals and don't want anyone else to either.

Aristocrats are people that try to put themselves out there as a positive example for the serfs to latch on to and live vicariously through. The serfs depend on the aristocrats to create some sort of archetype that they can then be proud of.

This is why any kind of successful person that isn't white is the subject to so much hysteria from the serfs. They don't really want meritocracy, they just want their aristocrats to succeed and make them feel valuable because the aristocrats will spend their energy appealing to the serfs and making them feel included in their success.

Once you understand this dynamic, I hope it might make sense how the methods you are proposing might not actually help the situation. It's not a logical position, it's a system of emotional dependency.

The real hateful ones are a lost cause. The pretend "aristocrats" on their own without supporters are mostly just losers themselves. But there is room to appeal to many of the would be serfs that just want to be included. The solution for this I think is stronger communities, building things, maybe apprenticeship programs.

One of the pretend aristocrats is not going to bother to actually argue your points, and honestly engage with you. They never do. He is just going to re-frame what you are saying to appeal to the emotional needs of his serf supporters, and make it seem like you are attacking them.I don't think reality is on your side here.To me, it seems like falling for bait.

Arguing for a racial hierarchy does not break down their position, it essentially is their position.

If you really want to take them to task on the issue, but in so doing you are championing a different permutation of racial hierarchy, I think it might not be a worthwhile victory.

Regardless of the order, it is essentially speaking their language, and confirming the validity of that kind of perspective.

Basically, I don't really know for sure, but I suspect this sort of debate is more like Go than it is like Chess. It seems you are looking for a checkmate sequence to be done with all the unpleasantness.

Trouble is, I don't think there really is one.

In Go, what you hope for at the end of a sequence is for your position to feel just a little bit better. You want their rhetoric to seem  just a little bit more hollow, and yours just a little bit more robust.

For example:

Message A: According to your own racist doctrine, you don't really think the world is a meritocracy. You are a hypocrite and your position is not consistent.

Message B: I hope you succeed in life. People tend to become much less racist and hateful the more success they have. Successful people help everyone around them become more successful, and with more success these problems you have will go away. It's our common interest that you succeed in life.

If I had the choice of which message to broadcast to a bunch of racist people, I think Message B would be more effective. It's less ambitious, it doesn't really try to finish off the discussion, but it is a secure position.

In response to statement A, a Nazi will just take the opportunity to deny that they are a supremacist, and be happy that you partly justified their racial ideas. Then they will try to say all they want is to be like BLM for white people.

In response to statement B, all they can really do is try to paint you as disingenuous, or deflect this kind of statement as not pertinent. They will continue with their rhetoric, but it will seem a bit more hollow.

They are arguing against the enlightenment, so I would use enlightened self-interest against them.I hate this memeI agree but adding please kill your self really undercuts your point lolIt’s almost as if being aware and apologizing can go a long way. But no morons double down on it and make shit worse. White people know why they shouldn’t say the nword, yet some act purposefully ignorant and dense to the issue and that’s even more frustrating. They never attack contra for what she said. They just say transphobic shitIf you mix tonka and Sargon you get ian I can't really google what's in your head though. If you want me to go off my own understanding research I would say you're wrong. The 77% figure is still due to discriminatory practices. Women aren't respected in hiring/salary/promotion negotiations, their resumes are devalued and social expectations and workplace harassment push themout of many fields. I'm not sure if youve already taken these into account. Why do women experience hiring discrimination?Sexism probably. Do you have a better explanation?You aren't really arguing here. Youve already admitted you don't know why you have the opinion you hold so I see no reason to listen to you when you tell me I'm wrong. Do you want to give me an argument or not?If you don't want to talk about this you probably shouldn't post about it or respond to people's questions. "Use deductive reasoning" isn't an argument. From what it sounds like the person who hasn't done that is you.That's your fantasy, not mine.It seems you're a shortbus yourself, since you can't grasp that I'm talking about the irrelevance of the age of the girl in the discussion.u/FlamingNipplesOfFire thinks that 19-year-olds are children. As if he wasn't 19 himself.I'm not at fault for your illiteracy. But you've made it somehow.No, you were far worse.Being competent at tech doesn't mean you understand biology, sociology or anything else. Damore might be a good programmer but that's a pretty weak appeal to authority.He thinks being part white means legit white.also its pretty reasonable to claim VODs just to limit the amount of people watching it on destiny's channel and not on his. I don't think he actually hates it. He wouldn't keep playing it if he did. The mental capacity I'm not arguing about, nor other factors unrelated to the technical age. I'm just saying that Destiny shouldn't have focused on the goddamned age because they're irrelevant.&gt;[jacking off] is the closest thing I can do to show my utmost respect.
What's google shaping public opinion on here? This is the worst possible example you could use.The weirdest part is all these Newgrounds artists or at least Stamper and Shadman (not sure about Oney) draw lolicon, bestiality, guro, and just disgusting shit. So why they'd use the pedo thing on Destiny is beyond me. Also I know Shadman is a "nazi" and he's the one who drew the autistic Destiny cartoon. So it's weird, seemingly a lot of the people from Newgrounds have very strong "anti-sjw" beliefs. I kinda wonder about Egoraptor since he is friends with all of them but has a kinda left leaning public persona, then again he was also friends and co-host with Jontron.Not sure if he's actually attracted to real children but he draws lolicon and bestiality shit a lot. A couple of years ago, I decided that I wanted to start *training* to become the world's greatest rocket scientist. Naturally, as a fan of Destiny and an *avid intellectual*, my first question was whether Destiny has ever discussed such a topic before with Mr. Mouton or some person on Twitter. I have yet to find said conversation, but I haven't yet given up hope. I know that when I *do* stumble across it, it will be akin to opening up a treasure chest full of facts and enlightenment. I don't have the answer to your question, but I just thought that you might find my personal experience helpful. Oh, and if anybody **does** happen to find a Destiny discussion on rocket science, please let me know so that I can stop being a shut-in and finally make something out of myself. :)Page not found.Again, you're the one demonstrating basic reasoning failures. You're pretty shit at talking to people. This is a ruse don't believe it guysYou sound like youve got a few screws loose dude.Ten words is too much for you?"If ten words is too much for you, you probably wouldn't be able to handle an actual argument" is though.

Also spamming "not an argument" isn't an argument.Which part?You ok buddy?I guess not.You realize someone saying something more than once doesn't make it not true right? Idk maybe you are just better at thinking than me but you're not demonstrating it, you just sound like an idiot here tbh.So do you admit you're being a dumbass about this? Because it really sounds like you don't have a reason to think the way you do.So would you say that validates any opinion he has on biology?That sounds like fallacious appeal to authority to me. If his evidence or reasoning is flawed his credentials don't undo that. Oh you're a Molyneaux fan aren't you?Didn't ice immediately switch platforms? Says he is done with politics.

Next tweet is immediately politically charged.

Wew.


Edit: This tweet got me blocked. RIPDid you get your understanding of logic from his book?Yes but the opinion you're expressing on deductive vs inductive doesn't exist outside of his weird system of logic.I emailed him apologizing. We shall see.Watching Mr Moisture I'd be shocked if it was over 80Yes, nobody else says "you used inductive reasoning so you're wrong".Sure thing buddy. If you ever figure basic logic out hit me up. Otherwise there's no real point talking to you. You keep moving the goal posts here. You know what I'm talking about. Or maybe you don't and there's no real point talking to you anyways. 

Calling someone retarded is not a violent threat https://i.gyazo.com/93dbcee10714b9152df5b032e853c826.pngI mean as far as I know, calling someone stupid isn't really a violation, if it is literally 99% of accounts would be suspended Bonus meme: [Metokur defending himself after making fun of sargon for the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6YSdUQUwRE)I primarily watch Destiny for political stuff so if he stopped I'd probably watch him far less. Not that his other content isn't good, it's just less my speedThis is actually good newsIf their biological sex and gender don't match? If they were born a male and identifiy as a female? Is this really hard to understand? Biological sex is what you're born with.
Gender is how you identify.


Identity is how you view your gender. So if you feel like you were born a man, but inside you feel like you're a woman who the fuck are you to say that I can't be a woman? Considering we have the medical technology to do these types of transition and it has literally zero effect on you, why does it matter? Gender disphoria is a very real thing. Feel free to read up on it.


Lastly, if you're too stupid or intolerant to understand that people are literally drove to the point of suicide because their body doesn't match how they identify, then I don't know what to tell you. Psychologist and sociologist all recognize that gender and sex are different. There is plenty of research and reading material on it if you're genuinely that confused. JF is somehow even creepier in a well lit studio instead of that dark room he's normally in wtf.i dont have an accountHow old is he?No. It is possible to have sex with a mentally disabled person without taking advantage of them. Also, ‘taking advantage of a mentally disabled person’ is not always considered statutory rape, depending on circumstances and what exactly the mentally disabled person is being taken advantage of for.I thought Destiny didn’t believe in the inbred offspring argument because it would take generations of inbreeding for the genetic problems to occur, and you sort of start making a case for eugenics, which can be applied to non-incestuous relationships that are genetically similar.So it's the second. You're just a moron.You can take advantage of somebody in ways other than sexually, which is what I meant (nitpicky, I know). Or you could be mentally incapacitated yourself and still 'take advantage' of a mentally disabled person, though I'm not entirely sure on that front, since the words 'taking advantage' kind-of insinuates knowingly utilizing their disorder.count jackula, jakula, oh hell idk. He explained it really welll in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlTeqG_ZHDU

don't really know much about this guy but this seems to be a little different from his normal scheduled programming for what that's worthI know, Fluttershy is clearly best pony, the fuck is this guy saying.This is literally a required meme for continued watching of Destiny.He always hated Society. It was his shtick when he was 17 years old, it's his shtick now. People incapable of feeling pain are still capable of appreciating what's wrong with having their hand melted. More importantly, the argument that you can always imagine someone with a crazy mental disorder that will disagree with any given moral statement, therefore we can't make any objective moral statements, is dumb. You're just assuming that nothing can be true unless everyone agrees on it. And that's dumb.&gt; he does not justify why we are to believe that is the case

It causes pain and potential injury without any benefit. These are things that human psychology is built to avoid. So his statement is true for humans.

&gt; you can craft any number of scenarios where touching the hot stove has a net benefit outcome

Here you're just not engaging with his argument fairly. If I say "putting a kettle on a stove will boil the water" and you respond "*but what if there's a hole in the kettle?*" or "*not if the whole kitchen is destroyed in a nuclear blast!" you're not engaging with what I said. You're sidestepping the issue instead of actually showing that heat doesn't cause water to boil.

Harris is definitely not saying that touching stoves is inherently evil in all circumstances. Just that, all other things equal, burning yourself is clearly worse than not burning yourself. For humans.And Harris would readily agree that there are complicated issues where we can only grasp towards better moral answers. He's just in favor of doing that grasping instead of giving up and saying we can't make moral judgments at all.So how would putting everyone in the worst possible misery remedy any of that?So we can just kill everyone, or at least throw the bodies of our dead in the garden instead of interring them. Why does this require putting everyone in the worst possible misery?No, "truth" and "objective" do not work by everyone agreeing on something. Not everyone needs to agree that gold is worth more than silver for gold to be worth more than silver. Likewise, we can assert that the human brain is constructed to seek pleasure, security, meaning, etc. without asking anyone's *opinion* on it.That's not what I said. We can take into account the full range of human experience and examine it. Some small fraction of people can believe that gold is worthless, and that is going to affect the value of gold to some extent, but it doesn't make it worthless. No individual's subjective opinion determines what is morally valuable to us, only the preference of all individuals plugged into the framework of our society.Why not both? I'm sure the vast majority that have a very basic grasp of science truly believe in the superiority of their race/genes. There can also be people who know they can't prove it but profit off the ignorance of the masses while still advocating for their own agenda/ideology. No im the highest tier, a youtube commenter heheheHonestly this doesn't seem nearly as bad as everyone made it sound on the subreddit. I wasn't around when this happened live, but this seemed pretty reasonable. Everyone deserves second chances. Shhhh were memeing in here Does anyone think Tonka actually gave some good commentary here? He basically just repeats how destiny is arguing with his mom, that's bottom tier reaction channel content. 33 weeks for attempted murder is pretty lenient. The reason he's climbing in viewers is because of constant shout outs from Andy. The reason why this hike correlated with Destiny coming on to debate is because that's around the time the drama in that corner of YouTube really started kicking off. Few, if any, people will have actually seen the debate with Destiny and decided to go over to his side that weren't already completely brainwashed. Rather, the famous discussion more likely served to sew seeds of doubt in the minds of his supporters and the people in the middle.What is "no one's morality is true to anyone but themselves" supposed to mean? If you value something like life and happiness I am able to recognize that without inhabiting your subjective experience.

&gt; Gold is neither good or bad but as a collective we all decide it's up and down value but there is never a true value in objective true value of what gold is

That's not true at all. No one gets together and "decides" what gold is worth. Many factors about the material, like its durability and scarcity and appearance, affect the way we perceive it. And the aggregate of everyone's perceptions, which we can determine without actually inhabiting their subjective experience, is what makes it valuable. Just because it's contingent on the operation of minds which also happen to have subjective experiences doesn't stop us from knowing it to be true that humans value gold.What in hell does "constant" have to do with it?  The temperature of something doesn't have to be "constant" for it to be part of objective reality. What are you even talking about?

And yes, "a certain collective of humans" is what we're talking about. Morality wouldn't exist if there were no beings capable of having their decisions affected by it. But those beings exist, so it does. Again, the fact that morality arises from the characteristics of human brains, which exist in objective reality, does not preclude it from being a perceptible facet of reality. Absolutely. It's impossible to pin down, but it *exists*. Harris' point is not that we can pin down exactly what the best possible moral code would be at any given time, just that there is such a thing. Likewise with health: we're very far from knowing exactly what the healthiest possible way to live is - its likely too complex for us to ever fully grasp - but we can still have meaningful discussions about what's healthy. Destiny better come back before our withdrawal period is over or we will no longer be addicted :SPure speculation on my part but during the Offline TV Christmas gift stream all the gifts were from Lily and Albert together, so that kind of points to couple.Whoever wins, we all lose.

To prevent that, nuke the winning team!LOUISE: You know what they say in ~~medicine~~ science: close enough!Calm down, Hawaii They may be British, they may be expats, but they're still morons.wtf did i just read lolWow this is a cool site thanks for sharing.I don't think he's representing the argument very well here. There's two questions,

1. Are there structural or cultural inequalities that contribute to the disparity of outcome.

2. Is allowing this disparity to continue socially optimal.

If there were no inequalities we could ask about the inherit differences but we can't do that till we get past the social issues.&gt;[the truth comes out](https://i.imgur.com/oN2Ucu3.png)[Neutral btw](https://i.imgur.com/MwiqryH.png)

Memes aside I would like to see you debating this with Destiny. The marketplace of ideas needs an easy win.[lol.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fakehistoryporn/comments/7qbp1h/donald_trump_makes_advances_on_porn_stars_stormy/dsp2wxr/?context=2)&gt; if women enjoy having sex with the people she likes she's dirty.

What man or woman doesn't like their women dirty? ;-)We reached the satire singularity again four years ago after it peaked from 2001 til 2009.This might be unpopular but Twitch really needs to get rid of IRL. I obviously don't know the full story of this dude but 99% of IRL clips are people acting like Logan Paul in public (seemingly after Ice got popular doing it) it really adds nothing to value of Twitch and its only gonna get worse in regards to something dangerous happening on stream.Liberalist btwTaiwanese reddit is making threads AS WE SPEAK.You're not even trying to read what he's saying in a  charitable way. You can't just take the one line about it sucklng to put your hand on a stove and imagine that he thinks every other moral decision can be judged based on whether some people think it sucks. Why is it stupid? both sides&gt; Because we all have our own subjective framework for how we perceive our morals

We perceive everything subjectively. Temperature, geometry, etc. Doesn't mean those things don't exist.

&gt; Therd is no objective moral truth for what is good or bad so you cannot create an "ought" for humanity.

That sounds pretty circular. What is it specifically about moral rules that makes it unlike other things that individual people experience subjectively, but third party observers can still see in the world? 

&gt; You can only create an "ought" for a subjective group of humanity who subscribes to those ideals.

Sure. Talking about human morality would be purely theoretical if no humans existed. So would talking about the human liver, or human art. Doesn't mean that those things don't exist outside people's subjective experience. She seems to have brown hair?  I don't know if the soul math will check out
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6jRJZOblPgHonestly these videos are really wholesome and cute Would've been funnier if the second guy in line already put three contacts in one eye.In Germany the Federal Office of Statistics conducts research on that topic every once in a while. 

There is 

a) the gender pay gap, which was 21% in 2016

b) the *revisied gender pay gap*, which was 6% in 2014

The revised gender pay gap takes these things into account:

- education and work experience
- volume of employment (in hours/week I presume)
- Job and sector
- Leadership and qualification claim (not sure what that is. Probably poor translation by me, although I barely understand it in German)
- other

So yes, the gender pay gap is real, at least over here. Women quite literally get less money for the same work. That is a fact.

http://www.equalpay.wiki/images/d/df/Bruttostundenverdienst.png

edit: Just for clarification, the unrevised gender pay gap is still valuable because clearly, that one's the reality of things for women, and understanding the social dynamics that lead to women being underrepresented in well-paid jobs is crucial to combating the pay gap. Shaun likely is referring to white males in Western nations like the USA or UK? I assume, I haven't watched the video yettotally showed my sweatshirt pic up, feels badI find this frankly astonishing!I think generally American Muslims at least vote Democrat http://www.pewforum.org/2017/07/26/political-and-social-views/From the same link, they also are less likely to identify ideologically as conservatives, are increasingly accepting of homosexuality, are pro-immigrant, and prefer big government - plus they're more woke about [the rights of black people](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/09/18/muslims-more-likely-than-americans-overall-to-say-blacks-lack-equal-rights-in-u-s/)

You're not wrong about Muslims having Republican family values (re: marriage, homosexuality), but I think it's less black-and-white than "Muslims generally disapprove of gay people therefore they're more Republican than white people"

**edit: just watching the video now and Shaun says "in a voting habits/political wing sense" so no, it's not an ignorant way to see things, it's actually the exact context Shaun specified**How are women "self-segregating" in these countries? What does that even mean? Women only work environments? Not to mention the fact that each country acts differently according to their own culture/society, that would certainly impact the representation seen in said country. As per the nordic gender paradox here is something I found via google

"In this book, Dr. Nima Sanandaji shows that the apparent paradox has a simple answer: Nordic welfare states are – unintentionally – holding women back. Public sector monopolies and substantial tax wedges limit women’s progress in the labour market. Overly generous parental leave systems encourage women to stay home rather than work. Welfare state safety nets discourage women from self-employment. On the other hand, the much-avowed affirmative action laws in Norway have not helped further women’s career possibilities."

Now you can argue if you wanted to about the inherent biological differences between the sexes but as you can see you're barely scratching the surface when it comes to problems of this complexity. People like you are always trying to simplify the conversation by stating some obvious point between the sexes which isn't pertinent to the underlying conversation. Maybe it's time to admit that you could be wrong or at least not as knowledgeable as you thought you were?Was Steven hacked? Some bizarre tweets today.Lmao thanks and THANKS, glad you liked it :&gt;A collective group of individualists OMEGALUL.
Wait, she was. Just because Trump is now in bed with the deep state and being more warmongering than he was during the campaign, doesn't make Hillary some sort of angel.For instance they know that genes exist and DNA and so on which play a role in the development of a person but then they vastly overstate the importance of the genes due to their very limited knowledge of the subject. Kinda equivalent to JF saying he's basically a lawyer since he's done some bullshit court stuff.I'll break this down into 4 parts:

1.) So no one is saying that every field needs to have a 50/50 split just for the sake of being equal and if they are then they are just as misinformed. Some people will argue for better overall productivity and efficiency with a more diverse workforce but thats besides the point. Naturally you would tend to see distinct fields gather more of one gender than another by any number of factors(government, societal, cultural, religious, etc) and one of those factors is probably biological. "In Denmark, the existence of "typical" female fields of study as well as "typical" male fields of study is likewise observable, with women predominantly entering the fields of education, health and welfare as well as humanities – as is predominantly the case in the EU. Interestingly, there are only 23.8% of women in the field of services which is substantially below the EU-27 average of 49.1% (25.3 pp). Despite the fact that Danish women are more active in the field of engineering and agriculture than the EU-27 average, gender-atypical fields of study ought to be further promoted in order to unfold the full workforce potential." Here is a link to the full study http://ec.europa.eu/justice/gender-equality/files/epo_campaign/131203_country-profile_denmark.pdf



2.) It's not about the culture being "better" or "worse", its just different. This difference will have an impact on the populace in different and similar ways. Then again I don't really know anything about Denmark's culture let alone India's culture so I can't really elaborate more on that. In the quote from the study it seems female engineers are more common in Denmark than other countries in the EU.


3.) I'm not sure if you're quoting me or talking about the quote I found on the subject. I honestly don't think anyone can be pressured or forced into a field against their will unless it's some type of slave labor, i think you're confusing influencing a decision with determining a decision. Another huge difference is that India is a developing nation while Denmark is considered first world, and top tier as well in the West, so any comparisons are already tenuous at best since they have vastly different government and societal structures. Lastly when women are free to do what they want they can still go into STEM fields and do. It will vary country to country and in some cases you'll see more women and in others you'll probably see more men and hell that trend might even change in the next 100 years. Don't forget women just got the right to vote 100 years ago(in the US) which is fairly recent in an historical sense.


4.) I don't think you know what i mean when i say nuance. I'm not talking about percentages but rather how the individual, family, community, city, state, country, world and all its complexities are interconnected and are constantly feeding and fighting with one another. I feel like a lot of people will just brush aside conversations like this because they most likely view it as obvious but are probably not capable themselves in actually answering these questions. Long story short you can continue to argue about the biological narrative driving each individual but that will always be a weaker case than arguing about how the environment shapes the individual.
I doubt genuine skepticism takes such a path. A proper skeptic would be, well, skeptical of any claims by white nationalists, let alone ethnic nationalists in general.I'd argue that few are and have remained properly skeptic, otherwise I know what you're talking about.[[Funk/Soul] Minnie Ripperton - Reasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en8B2xnxNRA)

Not always. In fact, hardly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vzz7GZuwRVU&amp;t=1487sIt's kind of confusing trying to follow your point. I think you're trying to argue the biological aspect of people choosing certain careers but then you give examples of how its beyond the control of the individual. In your examples of India and Denmark, you state India is forcing people to go into a certain career while Denmark has a more relaxed social pressure towards women, which would make it seem like the sex of a gender, their biology, is ultimately insignificant. 

I think you're really stuck on this idea of what it means to be a just/ideal society. There will never be a time when people say "we have reached the perfect ratio of genders/diversity in this field and it must always remain so" since the workforce is in constant flux and always changing. Have you ever heard of the Scully Effect? ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Scully#%22The_Scully_Effect%22 ) Its a cultural phenomenon where the character Dana Scully from the t.v. show The X-files increased/inspired a generation of female STEM students in a sense. This wasn't a government program or any NGO pushing their agendas on people, it was merely a new role model for young women to follow. Now we can state that maybe  80/20 is the current breakdown we see in certain science fields but 10 years ago, before the X-files, it was even lower, lets say 90/10. Was the increase of 10% women from the scully effect just or unjust because women lacked cultural representation during that period? was it forced? was it subliminal? or is it just another effect the environment has on the individual?

This is even more of the case in India. India is still a developing country with a population of close to 1 billion and have lots of impoverished people. There can't really be a scully effect in India because it has a different standard of living compared to the West. They have less access to information, T.v , etc.. So in order to encourage people to try new fields you have to get in there and talk to the populace. Now if you have a choice between 16 hours in the hot sun farming or going to school to study to better yourself, you can hardly say anything is being forced on these women in India. Also I highly recommend you read this entire article (or at least the history) of Women in India ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_India ) as it will give you a better perspective and more of a cultural/historical context.

&gt; My argument is that given a completely just environment, we would probably see STEM ratios similar to what they are now.

That's just a silly thing to argue or say, the workplace demographics are always changing. The workplace of 2018 is different from the workplace of 2010 and 2000 and 1990 and will continue to change in 2019, 2020, 2030, and so on. Lastly, if I give you 2 names, James and Brittany, who is more likely to be a doctor and who is more likely to be a nurse and why? what factors play into the decision?

He was trying to say John Locke and Marxist LULDave Chapelle is cool and all but if you want some SWEATSTINY political comedy you should listen to David Cross. People are constantly walking out during his live shows https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQbrm4nqayQWhelp! It was a good LeRuse while it lasted...Oh David cross, you blowhard!Care for some solidarity from an omnivore like me?I really hope he didn't say that recently because that would be the most retarded thing he's ever said. He could have made this argument when switching from SC2, but absolutely not now. 

League doesn't even get close to providing the same growth &amp; donations that politics/other singleplayer games do. League cuts viewer interaction to a minimum and by extension donations. Also, it's a super competitive game to stream, and he's not giving new viewers any incentive to pick him over the others by raging and/or going silent in every game he's in. 

I've always been under the impression that Destiny is very aware that not playing league (or other games that causes him to go silent/rage) will be economically more feasible, but he's fine with it since he really enjoys league.How can we determine if she was standing to the camera?JF could be wearing heels too.The way she has her it makes no difference.And I agree, Trump for sure is not better than Hillary in general, but during the campaign trail, he was for sure against the Iraq war, talked about how he want to troops to be back from countries like Syria, and that is for sure better than Clinton.
When I say "deep state", i mean the neoconservatives, and neoliberal that take money from military "defense" contractors like Boeing and supporting endless war. :)I'm starting to seriously wonder - Does Destiny *really* enjoy League? 

&gt;The last time he was banned and quit he said he was happy about it **so that he didn't have to play anymore**. Why didn't he quit before?

&gt;He's constantly going on about how he hates the game. 

&gt;The smallest setback sets him up for massive tilt.

[](/HmmStiny)

Does this seem like a man who enjoys League? Am I the only one considering the possibility that Destiny has a serious addictive problem with League, that outright negatively affects his psyche and quality of life? If this is the case, are we to encourage the continuation of this? Should we not help Destiny find a way out of it? I think MrMouton who keeps perpetuating Destiny's addictive behavior should think long and hard about what effects he has on someone he considers a friend. /u/RemixxingIt's not about relative superiority but meeting a certain threshold. Whatever the criteria for sapience is. The aliens can still be immoral. No, sentience is the ability to experience sensation. Animals are sentient. Humans have another trait called sapience which is essentially the ability to make rational judgements.

I don't see how it's inconsistent, the aliens would be wrong for killing sapient creatures.Then we disagree fundamentally. Imo the important thing is being able to understand rationally what's happening to you beyond just a basic fear response. We can just kill animals. Is this entire conversation therefore important?

The problem with moral discussions is they're inherently axiomatic. If you disagree with a fundamental belief of mine we can't reconcile each others positions.

This is a strange point to make.I think mentally handicapped people are still sapient.It's still wrong to torture animals though, just for a different reason.If the aliens will kill you no matter what argument you make what's the point to making any argument about this?

Both, understanding the situation rationally is a direct result of sapience.

There can be multiple parts to a moral system. As far as babies go, any harm inflicted on a baby could have lasting impact when they grow up. This would therefore be harming a sapient being.Is there any value to eating a baby? Human meat is generally bad for human consumption, whereas animal meat isn't. Eating the baby doesn't benefit anybody. It is sort of hard to say, a lot of this comes down to intuitionism though. I guess if we're going to treat babies as a category they are capable of sapience.Why should the aliens value the social contract in the first place? What's the rational justification for that?

Then you've prevented the self actualization of a sapient being. The baby would have grown up to have the same level of reasoning as any other person but you've prevented this. Also random cruelty to animals is also wrong.In the context you've provided not logically. Emotionally though it would be. You could also argue there's a non-zero chance the baby could actually grow up though.

Do you apply empathy universally? The same to all things?But the problem with this is at some point you find something that has no reason to value the social contract, some sort of apex predator. If the aliens have no need to fear a more powerful species they have no concern for the social contract. Further their standards for a social contract could be different from ours. For the same reason we believe animals can't enter social contracts they might say we couldn't either.

The potential for sapience could be part of it yes.

If we assume cruelty is a negative, there must be some positive to justify it. Again this is axiomatic but so is the social contract.I'm pointing out a grammatical error that he's failed to correct. What do you think I meant?
You should try the Unnatural Vegan on YouTube.Proganda? Is that the other Uganda? Do you know de wey?Wait, what exactly did Monte do that people call him racist? I haven't follow his shit after his departure from League.Wait that seems pretty reasonable, and how is homophobic and racism the same thing Cx.Ehh not in this situation but Monte does defend Richard and Thorin all the time and we all know how they are.I wish we could pay Destiny to ban all the normie fuckboys like you from the community who are intelectually bankrupt enough in the head to prefer League to any other content.

Badbunny is unironically one of the most interesting people Destiny regularly talks to, who can actually hold up a conversation about something.Hey im not for an Ethno-state SWEATSTINYNot sure if that's what you wanted, but here is the [scientific answer.](http://i.imgur.com/VnlbXb4.jpg)Is it inconceivable for a species to know or believe they are the apex predator of the universe? Would it be inconsistent then for them to disregard the social contract? Further, must they have the same standards for a social contract we do? Maybe they exclude us from that criteria. Further, is this meant as a moral or pragmatic argument?

Domestication proves that animals can engage in a form of social contract. Animals can be bred or conditioned to preform labor for treats and to defer to human authority. If the aliens have some sort of hive mind psychology they could conceivably only value social contracts with creatures that could enter their hive mind. This is just one example though.

For the same reason you say animals can't enter social contracts. Rights are only valuable if the creature can conceive of them. A sapient creature can have a concept of self and an understanding that other creatures have the same.This is more "western civilization" cuckery more than Christ Cuckery. I hate yelling RACISM, but some of them genuinely do have racist tendencies or slightly racist views torwards brown people in particular. This manifests in weird ways because nowadays you can't just flat out say that "I don't like n-words" but it is completley ok to demean their culture. This christ-cuckery is just an extended form of that instead of risking the blowback that comes of demeaning the way other people view the world they instead champion anything they associate culturally with being primarily white. As dumb as it is, christianity and good ole christian values = white, in their mind. 

Have you ever noticed Stefan Molyneux or other alt right guys weird disdain for rap music. It doesn't stop at "hey it's not my thing", a few people on the alt right genuinely hate rap music calling it degenerate or some other nonsense. While this is somewhat off-topic it does illustrate that to them it really comes down to brown people vs. white people, which forces them into untenable positions like advocating for "christian/western(white) values"he knows his audience well thenTo be immoral then you have to place value on your own self preservation. Can you rationalize this?But how can you convince someone that doesn't value their self preservation that that's immoral?The answer is and always will be A.So couldn't your earlier argument be applied to this one? If the aliens disagree fundamentally you can't convince them.Fair enough.

Back to the apex predator point, do you consider something like a god impossible? A hypothetically omnipotent being?What's paradoxical about it?Couldn't omnipotence simply be the ability to do anything not logically impossible?You could say the same thing about aliens being able to visit our planet though. FTL travel currently seems like an impossibility.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox

How do you reconcile the Fermi paradox?Then does god not have to be real for that to factor into the hypothetical?Would this be the case if God was simply omnipotent or only if he were omni-benevolent?The earth and the sun being flat, situated on parallel planes is a fundamental pillar in my theory. If the earth was round it would require its radius to be less than 5 feet which is ridiculous lol. Imperial made sense when the most accurate tools available for measuring were your body parts, e.g a thumb or a foot.

I prefer to discuss whether the European temperature scale Celsius is better than Fahrenheit, the other European temperature scale. Kind of throws feminists under the bus, but
that does at least demonstrate that you are trying to present your perspective and not meet some standard of ideological purity.

I think that is important to do. If your message leaves the impression that you are jusy trying to meet some standard of ideological purity some people will just reject everything you are saying.

Its sort of like how Destiny thinks the controversies and stuff he has been through in the past gives him more credibility in some sectors. He isn't taking a position just to get in line, because he isn't really "in line" anyway.

I think making that a feature of your presentation is important if you want to be persuasive. I don't think the way you chose to do it is the best, but I can't off the top of my head think of a better way.

It's the right sort of thing to be thinking about at least. What is the best way to do that.Let them fight.Well, at least it logically follows that if you like League, you should like MrMouton as well. Both are just as cancerous.You sound just like the /pol/ retards who say Destiny just screams at people and insults them, because they've never actually been exposed to more than clips of him.

If you just go to her twitch channel you'll see she actually talks about a variety of topics. Something I wish Destiny would do instead of the endless league shit.Link me a pubg VOD where the majority of it is spent hearing her shout asshole at chat, or other annoying things.

How is race realism "biology 101"? Pretty sure topics of genetics are not covered in an entry level course, it's almost equivalent to Earth Sciences back in high school. JF's whole claim is that his science background gives him the authority to make "statements" about race. JF undoubtedly has a better grasp of science than your average nobody but at the moment he's just the resident "smart guy" that the alt-right points at for their scientific authority.Because your opinion is shaped from very limited exposure, and you're making her out to be something she's not.

Do not talk shit about BadBunny. [](/MLADY)Looks great! Would love to see a HQ scan of the final product :)I'm not really sure where I'm going with this anymore. You're probably right about social contract being the more defensible position. No VR Chat is shit tier memes, and ruined constantly by stream snipers. Even disregarding all that it doesn't seem like a very Destiny thing to do or play.&gt; most accurate

Words are hardOk, now i'm interested since it seems I missed this topic in class. Can you explain/show how the theory of evolution proves "race realism"? Are you saying that other "humans" besides homo sapiens exist? Do we still have neanderthals or Homo erectus walking the Earth? Or are you saying we need to define some sort of sub-genus for homo sapiens?There are options for her to safely separate herself from the child, there's currently no comparable alternative to abortion.How about the hill that says the imperial system is just as accurate as the metric system -- because it's based on the metric system?

That still subjects them to 9 months of pregnancy.https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/safehaven.pdf

You can surrender the child immediately.Bottom row people.IMO the implications of caring for a child are different. Bodily autonomy trumps financial autonomy.I'd say so yes.Please talk to this dude, I think it would be really productive.

If you didn't know, [He had a 3 hour talk with JF where he dismantled him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvfoQQP7hFo).At that point killing the baby violates it's bodily autonomy. After being born, the baby doesn't impose on the mother's bodily autonomy in the same way.\#highwayrobberyMaybe they should just give up and be accepting of their Jewish overlords, the true master race.He's afraid Seder will be like the Pakman interview, only 10x more confrontational and that Seder will channel all the critiques people have had on Rubin for awhile now.

Are they talking about day9?

[](/SWEATSTINY) [](/SWEATSTINY) [](/SWEATSTINY) &gt;All JF has to say as a moral nihilist that he places no value or less value on conscience

JF actually walked this back in their talk, which surprised me. The reason he argued for baby making over well-being was for pragmatic reasons. He admitted to favoring well-being philosophically, and in an ideal world without certain evolutionary mechanics, he would also be for it.Asian man supports people who think whites are superior, really makes you think.Yes back when Rubin first Left TYT and was at least sane, he had those people on his side and they made up his reddit page. He went of the deep end and those people stayed.Love Lily, so wholesome and seems to be an all around good person. I hope Destiny never burns that bridge.Oh well, at least he ain't pretending anymore lolIs there a VOD?Meh, Dunkula is fucking dreadful. Destiny should have some standards.Trying to take the moral highground with that G2A sticker in the middle of the screen.

I'm pretty sure that's not what the Buddha had in mind.When you look at tge timeline of gamergate the goal was never ethics in gaming journalism. It was getting progressive politics out of gaming journalism. If this happens, Steven can't let him get away with the twin studies billshit by only telling half the story. https://www.citylab.com/life/2015/12/povertys-role-in-intellectual-development/420822/This does not fit the definition of a myth any more than currency does. These things are ordinary social consteucts.Isn't Jampalang just a shit troll?Utilitarianism is not at odds with capitalism. I don't know where you heard that.Gamergate was a reframing of the Five Guys backlash against Zoe Quinn. That's not ethics. If I go on KiA right now how many posts do you think will be about ethics in games journalism? How many about social justice? Finally, can you name one major ethics violation gg exposed?What was unethical about those articles? That multiple outlets had the same take on the same story? If gg was about ethics, why did Zoe Quinn matter? Or Anita Sarkeesian? Why were the Ralph Retort and Milo regular submissions? Why did nobody in gg recognize the mob mentality and shift off the public shaming or contacting advertisers/employers?I don't think multiple outlets having the same take on the same issue is that weird. How else should they have reacted to the Zoe Quinn situation?Right up there with Anderson Cooper asking Christopher Hitchens if he prayed, or if the late Jerry Falwell would be in heaven.I don't know why he says that he never gets offended by what other people say when this is a clear example that he does. 

edit bonus memes: In league it does not really seem he takes it all that seriously. Which is odd because he rages all the while throwing the gameIt depends. I'm fine with journalists are working together to put out better stories I think it's a good thing. If the allegations are true that they were trying to deceive people and control a narrative that's bad.Didn't he talk with everyone? What about the good Samaritan parable?To be fair, the Rube would be joking there.At this point I think you're really disingenuous on the points you're making but for the hell of it i'll keep responding.

"Race is a concept used in the categorization of humans into groups, called races or racial groups, based on combinations of shared physical traits, ancestry, genetics, and social or cultural traits. Although such groupings lack a firm basis in modern biology, they continue to have a strong influence over contemporary social relations." Here you should read this entire wiki article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)

"In biology, a species is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank, as well as a unit of biodiversity, but it has proven difficult to find a satisfactory definition. Scientists and conservationists need a species definition which allows them to work, regardless of the theoretical difficulties. If as Linnaeus thought, species were fixed, there would be no problem, but evolutionary processes cause species to change continually, and to grade into one another. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species

I recommend you read the entirety of both wiki articles before continuing on to discuss your post on race realism. That being said your post is full of contradictions and i'm guessing maybe you have a connotation of "race realism" that most people don't agree with.

&gt; I am entirely convinced that he vast majority of you are actually race realists though, in the strictest sense of the word.

At this point you're gonna have to define what race realism means to you as compared to how others interpret it since people will have different ideas as to what the strictest sense of race realism means. 

&gt;Premise 2: The socially constructed word "race" roughly maps onto groups of current day humans along certain phenotype lines, i.e. skin color.

Here you admit that "race" is a social construct, which is a social mechanism, phenomenon, or category created and developed by society; a perception of an individual, group, or idea that is 'constructed' through cultural or social practice. So you've already abandoned any notion that "race" is a biological construct and to make matters worse you say this:
 
&gt;Bonus protip: Yes the exact number of races you want to use is kind of arbitrary. Yes it's going to change depending on culture. Why? Because "race" in the sense that we use it, as an abstraction over biological constructs, is just an approximation. If you want to invent 500 different names for races, you could. It's just a matter of how much detail you want to speak in. You could even invent a race for every person. But it doesn't change the fact that the races we, as English speakers, use are valid descriptors of biological constructs.

So then whats the answer? are there 7 billion different races since its extremely rare to share an identical genetic make-up? Can we not just make a social construct of 1 race with lots of genetic variance? This entire argument is so fucking arbitrary that it ends up being nonsensical. No one would ever say that all humans are the same because that's obviously not true, but then to make a jump and say that because minor differences are there it justifies the classification of a "race" is beyond absurd. Not to mention the whole race realism debate isn't about minor differences in the races but a justification of racial superiority of X race over Y race. 

Lastly i guess we should talk about the only source you quoted. In one of the quotes above, there are multiple branches of Science (i.e. Anthropology) that still used "race" as a terminology in order to conduct their research regardless of its problematic social implications. This is because of the social relevance that "race" still holds in regard to certain fields of study. Generally though "while some researchers use the concept of race to make distinctions among fuzzy sets of traits or observable differences in behaviour, others in the scientific community suggest that the idea of race often is used in a naive or simplistic way, and argue that, among humans, race has no taxonomic significance by pointing out that all living humans belong to the same species, Homo sapiens, and (as far as applicable) subspecies, Homo sapiens sapiens." Here is the last paragraph of the paper you cited: "In summary, from a very large study of four major racial/ethnic groups within the United States and Taiwan, we found extraordinary correspondence between SIRE and genetic cluster categories but only modest geographic differentiation within each race/ethnicity group. This result indicates that studies using genetic clusters instead of racial/ethnic labels are likely to simply reproduce racial/ethnic differences, which may or may not be genetic. On the other hand, in the absence of racial/ethnic information, it is tempting to attribute any observed difference between derived genetic clusters to a genetic etiology. Therefore, researchers performing studies without racial/ethnic labels should be wary of characterizing difference between genetically defined clusters as genetic in origin, since social, cultural, economic, behavioral, and other environmental factors may result in extreme confounding." It seems to me the whole point of this study was to show some of the flaws in regards to Case-control association studies who don't use race labels as "it is tempting to attribute any observed difference between derived genetic clusters to a genetic etiology."

Also just curious at this point but what is your stance on the Nature vs Nurture argument? I feel like your answer to this will give me a better idea about your views/thoughts.Unrelated to the video but read the pinned comment. It's exactly the confirmation bias destiny was talking about.I'd tell you but I don't want day9 coming after me. [](/SWEATSTINY)Did anyone else have the "post game depression" meme? With all the games I play I simply cease to care about it when I've beaten it and uninstall. I thought it was gonna be the same for this, but oh boy was I in for a ride. I couldn't stop thinking about the game, and it went on for days, like a empty void inside of me, almost alike to how you feel after a pet dies. I kept going back playing myself and watching videos of others. 

It wasn't the ending that got me, just the fact that I developed really strong feelings for the characters (max especially). The game just being over and me having to part with max and her inner dialogue that I had gotten so used to wasn't something I wanted to accept. Being in love with max and having the game end was truly a traumatic experience. I couldn't do anything other than watching life is strange videos for like a month after it ended.

I don't think I got depressed because of the endings or any of the fucked up things that happened, but moreso because I had grown so attached to some of the characters and the environments, so having it end, no matter how it ends, made me feel completely lost craving for more.

Thinking about it more, I don't know if you can really call it depression. I experienced sad emotions and cried multiple times, but could still on a deeper level enjoy the sad feelings. With all the sadness, also came the feeling that life was much more worth living again, because of all the positives the game had made me experience. 

I recommend everyone and /u/NeoDestiny to try this game. You'd think a game about high school drama would be boring before you play it. But with life is strange you don't get the "boring high school drama vibe" at all. It perfectly manages to create a very powerful immersive nostalgic vibe where you remissness about teenager stuff. Everything in it is designed for maximum immersion, the atmosphere, literal hypnotic effects, very believable characters, the familiar feel of the setting, exactly the right emotional dosage, and of course integrating the usual immersion-breaking savescumming into the gameplay itself. It gets the atmosphere perfectly right with the music and themes like suicide, bullying, loss of friendship, growing up, etc. 

Constantly hearing Max's internal dialogue as she reflects on everything going on also makes her really grow on you as a character. At times you end up almost knowing everything she will say, and often feel the exact same way. As Max develops and becomes stronger you feel proud of her, because over the course of the game she has grown so close to you. Especially so in episode 5. Between the savage comments towards Vic and the main villain, and the sheer fearlessness that resulted from her growth, I couldn't help but to almost be in awe of her. Video game protagonist are often empty shells for you to project yourself onto, so it really stands out when you get someone who can hold their own as passionately as Max did. I don't think I've ever experienced a piece of art that makes its universe seem so real and connected to you.

Also, reminder that Max is the most compassionate, kind, loving, sweet, cute, innocent, brave, caring, adorable, funny, intelligent, loyal, passionate, polite, sensitive, thoughtful, understanding, warmhearted, witty, creative, considerate person in the entire universe!

WOWSER [](/AngelThump)That's it thanks.Can you elaborate on this? I'm not really sure what you're saying here.Do you have a source explaining this situation?&gt;The authenticity of the leak was verified by group creator, Ars Technica Senior Editor Kyle Orland, who apologized for making statements in the conversation that he "soon came to regret." Orland denied the allegations of collusion, stating that GameJournoPros "has never had litmus tests, partisan slant, or other viewpoint-based membership criteria," and that "Ars Technica management did not know of the list's existence." [15]

Polygon Editor-in-Chief Christopher Grant, also addressing concerns of writer collusion and media bias in an editor's letter, stated that discussions regarding ethics and disclosures were common on the group, and that most of the group's members often disagreed with one another.[16]

This seems to disagree with your representation.Do you think the existence of a group where journalists communicate proves the kind of negative collusion I described earlier?What a shame. That guy is ripped too, if his head wasn't so big he would be fucking your girl right nowDon't worry boys, I'm hiring JF to do a class action lawsuit if he doesn't play it.If you thunk this is bennificial to the claims of race realists on IQ, you are a moron.

That's what regulations are for.That isn't completely true. Companies like Walmart are very much comparable to the wealth of Google.

edit: Besides, there is no rule that all wealth need to be equally taxed. It seems reasonable that wealth derived from the exploitation of social programs should be disincentivised, but wealth created from developing new technology not be disincentivised.So what if the ethically best possible world is a world in wich there is some balance between capitalism and socialism?Scottish born and bred here.

This is actually a relatively common attitude to have where I'm from, which is admittedly probably the most right leaning area of Scotland right now (in that we voted in a Tory). 

The denial of British identity has more to do about the denial of English identity than anything else. Nobody will deny that we are technically British, but admitting to that fact is seen as an acceptance of the cultural dominance of the English. To be British is to be English like in some people's eyes. 

It's stupid as shit, but Dankula isn't really too wrong here. I have spoken to a fair few people who voted Remain who would deny their British and European cultural identity. Especially the European part. The UK has always kept itself at arms length with the continent. 

Never mind that Scotland's longest lasting alliance was with the French. 

And yeah, it seems that Destiny is talking geographic identity, which is undeniable, while Dankula is being obtuse and talking cultural identity.To be fair, some of lads up north might as well be from a different planet. Cannae understand the lot of them.Even with a second referendum, I don't think Scotland would vote to leave the Union at this point. I honestly think the only way forward for pro European Scots would be to push a second referendum on Brexit, which I think would almost certainly swing Remain now.You do realize that if MrMouton wouldn't be there, ready for league every day, Destiny would be more likely to play other games, right?

A few days ago, he outright demonstrated this is true by sharing his thought process with everyone:

So tonka decided to deliver his speech to his stream anyways.

Still ridiculous for someone claiming to own 3 businesses.Tbf he could be mixed or have Native American heritage. Impossible to tell. Race is such a dumb concept.

If you look at this scene where he stands next to a white guy, I'd argue Tonka is probably not white:

I'm sorry but these two concepts are incompatible.Athene needs to team up with Destiny against the alt right. I miss the innocent Athene memes. 

[](/DaFeels)I have yet to understand why anyone cares about Warski besides his functional role as a useful idiot to the alt-right. I have met very few people whose lack of intelligence is clear from just the way the talk and inflect their words. He sounds like that guy in class who struggled to read more that a sentence in grade school and his logic or reasoning is incredibly simple to boot.

I had to stop watching his content and when I peaked back in for a JF debate about race realism, in the span of two minutes he said(paraphrasing here) "my chat says you are a troll, so I have to discredit everything you're saying"... 

Without hesitation I turned off the stream.

They have zero self-awareness. \#leavecammyalone

Even if having hot women in skimpy outfits part of the game, isn't that appealing to bisexual/lesbian women, too? Isn't it homophobic to denounce such portrayals?I'm honestly not sure I've ever seen a picture of JF that wasn't photoshopped.I'll delete because someone else posted it a few days ago.The range of characters on the stream is pretty extreme, both good and bad.

Sometimes reality is stranger than fiction.I don't want to talk about them, but it's worth saying that I don't want Destiny talking to them anymore either.

Particuarly Tonka. I've been sick this last week, and with the fatigue involved like I suck at all the stuff I'm normally good at. It's been a difficult week.

This is addressed to Destiny.

Cut ties. Stop. It's not worth it. I don't want to listen to this shit. It's an elementary school level debate at best. You know it's not a real exchange of ideas occurring here.

You are playing right into Tonkas strengths, and the only way you will "win" is if you become more tiresome than him to listen to.

Until then I'm out.THAT WAS ONE EPISODE OKI got downvoted for saying this, but I think that the "I'm bored", "This is boring" comments and just being overall aggressive turned away someone, who just *maybe* could have been swayed. Even if he was too rooted in his own ass to turn around, swaying the opponent should always be the goal. I saw someone else point this out, but his rhetoric is impeccable. He is really talented in a way when it comes to that. He knows how to deal with the idiots wellThey also have shit taste, like if you're gonna be a loser white knight at least white knight for a hot girl and not good old 180 FoV.Love your posts. Just curious: What is your opinion on Jean's biological expertise given that's he's got a PHD? 
And do you think his racist tendencies predate his biological "findings" on race realism or did biology turn him racist?Thanks a lot!Found the BV white knight boisHow this hammerhead shark only got a one day ban is beyond me, especially since she was perma banned before twitch did a mass unban.Are you reading your own arguments against me? Her points don't even deserve a response, clearly she was being extremely racist and who gives a fuck about her. Go back to /pol/ and defend M'lady there.A bit of advice guys. Stop giving this girl any attention. I have done my research and it is readily apparent she is not very smart with no interesting ideas, but she also is a huge attention whore. She does outlandish shit like this so she can then go on her youtube and twitter and claim to be a victim. Also, because she is actually racist it is not a troll she is racist, full stop. 

Save your breathe for people who actually matter. People who are out here who can actually do damage in spreading their toxic ideology. The Alt Hyp's and Ben Shapiro's of the world. Not this clownIs the grandmother thing legit? Don't link it but if it's actually true that's fucked up.I think we should dive into another topic, honestly. The Anti-SJW community has turned out to be absolutely cancerous and toxic to even be anywhere near. Not saying that he should never debate on these topics again or come anywhere near the community, but he needs to be careful and take it in moderation. I want to see new topics being discussed. Sure it's fun seeing Tonka getting smashed over and over again, but I want to see some more veganism debates to see if my boi comes over to the correct side. Or maybe some more psychology debates. You really want to see me huh, try grindr boy. I’m not gay sorry.No way, he’s a newgrounds OG. He hangs with all those wierd alt-right artists like Shadman and shit.I called Brittany and Ian retarded without tagging them and got suspended. They will mass report anything.... Holy shit maybe you’re not a white knight. Maybe you’re actually Brittany.Something similar happened to me yesterday. I clicked crop in MS paint on a screenshot, and it just moved what I had selected to the corner like this.The strawman "populist" position so to speak is that international trade is inherently bad.

I think Bernie's position was more nuanced. The way I understood it, the point is, problems are not inherent to the economics of trade. They are more to do with how large corporations lobby for their own interests, and trade agreements give them a good opportunity form them to put their own interest over the public interest in policy.

Increasing trade is not what causes problems. It's the specific stipulations that specific corrupt industries get away with. For example, NAFTA gave the US agricultural industry the opportunity to dump subsidized corn into Mexico, which caused lots of problems.

It's not impossible to believe that tariffs are bad in general but in specific circumstances they can prevent problems. It's not crazy to think tariffs should be removed with public interest in mind. 

I don't think that kind of perspective on international trade is as insane as it's made out to be.Lol so you attack my looks because you think it's wrong I attacked her looks. Really makes you think? It's pretty simple. Write the trade policy to encourage real competition and to let the economics actually work.

Our economy is pretty developed. Lots of the experience in different industries is no longer about how to develop the market further, but how to manipulate the market.

You don't want people that are behaving anti-competitively to write the trade policy. Thinking that industry leaders are always trying to avoid market failure is a big meme. They make more money when the market fails.Interesting, thanksRichard blocked me after I called him out politely on some misinformation he was spreading. 

He's a snowflake who's always butthurt about Destiny.Huh. Just imagine if someone told people to kill themselves on an internet stream. Statistically, some percentage of them would actually do it. Basically murder.

You're a retard.When has he ever done that?&gt; blamed all kinds of other things for things that are wrong.

Huh??? No one's saying that we can't blame "things" for "other things." He would be hypocritical if he was blaming other people for his own personal problems. That's the claim the OP made, for which no one has provided any examples.I think the part we enjoy is the newness. I dont think we would enjoy this if it was every day or every other day. 

Now if we had like talks on Fridays where he drove around at night and talked about shit that would be fun.Bonus meme: [Is allegedly in the process of hiring legal help for the lawsuit.](https://twitter.com/JFGariepy/status/958317270069063680)&gt; telling someone he is the reason for his own misfortune is way more powerful than just tell someone to kill himself

Oh, OK. I didn't realize that. I guess you're right. I want this child to go to court. I want him to represent himself and I want to see it LIVE. I want destiny to dress up nicely in his blue coat and watch this retarded fucker melt in front of an actual system.

Bonus meme would be them talking about the retarded girl and a prosecutor following up on it and pressing charges. This guy is a sick fucking psycho.&gt; paid for these games

&gt; donations 

HmmstinyDOWNVOTED

get self moderated you scumI'd say that people shouldn't expect ANYTHING from a donation. It's why it's called a [donation](https://www.etymonline.com/word/donation) in the first place. If you actually pay for a service then that's a different thing entirely.Is the ban permanent?Yeah? You don't get to dictate what they should or shouldn't do with the money. If you donate to charity and say "build more water wells in village xyz" do you think that would happen?You could've spent that money to hire someone working under a contract to build it instead? 

If you mean with charities, the money you give them often doesn't go specifically into building that specific thing. The idea of donating to charity is that you're giving them money in the hopes that they'll stay up and keep doing what they're doing. 

In a similar way you donate money under the hope that destiny will keep streaming, not to request a game being played. Even if destiny goes on to say "If someone donated me 500 dollars to stop playing league of legends for 2 weeks I promise I'd do it" he's still under no obligation to follow through. You didn't actually **pay** him to stop playing. Him being an asshole about it and breaking a promise is something you can be annoyed about though, sure, lowering his reputation and probably donations considerably.Mind you, they're still under no obligation (except for watchdogs that check they at least tried because of laws, which is specific in the case of charities) to actually follow through. Maybe I'm misremembering but how specific then was steven in promising to play Nier?&gt; Seems like we agree now that that sentence was absolute nonsense.

shouldn't != don't

People do expect something from a donation, I'm arguing they should not.  

&gt; If a friend of you told you he'd fix your sink if you "donated" money to him, would you assume that meant he'd fix it with week long breaks in between and in the laziest way possible?

My friends wouldn't use the word donated for such a thing but if they did I'd ask them to clarify.

&gt; Obviously when giving your friend money you think he'll do his job in a reasonable manner, whether he uses the words "pay me" or "donate to me" doesn't make any difference.

I'd argue that it does. It's a huge difference. 

&gt; it's just a shitty thing to behave that way towards people who trusted him with their money

Yep, I still would agree on that.

For instance, one of the huge problems I have with Destiny's ban is that Destiny [in no way violated the ToS](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/personal-information) by 'releasing' information about Tonka. That's not to say don't report people, just-double check that what you're reporting is against Twitter's ToS. :-)'months of harassment' ? I didn't even know about JF until he talked about chainfucking women and mentally retarded girls for ze bbys and love. Did i miss a few good tweets/debates?Jordan Peterson is this generations' Ayn Rand. Kill me now plzApparently there was additional information and after doing a little digging it seems like there might be a link between Tonkas ring name/pictures and his real identity.

Does Twitter just prohibit talking about rape in general? JF raped a girl and Destiny called him out on it. The girl, in Destiny's eyes, is not able to consent to sex. You can disagree with whether it's rape, but I don't think Twitter is in the game of silencing voices that speak out about sexual assault, especially with the #MeToo movement.This guy donated to Steven several time yesterday to get him to talk with him about it, and Destiny basically said that as this point any conversations about CP would be career suicide as the skeptic community and what not have become so nuclear on him. Hes trying to lay low on some of the more controversial stuff for now, I believe. Gowdy isn't necessarily leaving politics, I heard on the radio that he will try going into the judiciary branch next...

On the brighter side, Gowdy leaving is like the 25th house republican to announce their retirement prior to the 2018 mid-terms which increases the chances of the house flipping to the democrats; given they get their shit togetherSounds like you're into some shit memes, my dude.Obviously you've never met a Spaniard. Ah. Now Hollywood liberalism makes sense. Isn't the imperial system also European; Fahrenheit is a European scale etc? On the subject of "when does a human become human" or "when is it legitimate to deplatform someone," keep in mind that Destiny doesn't get the concept of a fluid spectrum – *there must be a hard line between two states. /s*

I think using time as a measurement is fine. I want Destiny to debate other instances of time in our justice/moral system. Does a low age of consent mean that Destiny considers that country to allow pedophilia?

Is it not enough that there is an arbitrary limit with additional layers of judgement calls (cases that might work contrary to those arbitrary lines, e.g extremely premature birth or sex between similar aged teens below+above the line)?Wait what?It would 100% happen again in America because of the way we have disenfranchised blacks in this country. We're only one or two generations removed from legalized discrimination, so a lot of these effects are still felt in the black community. Enforcing policy based on education would 100% negatively affect the black population in the US and kind of goes against our foundations of democracy anyways. Our government is supposed to be for the people, by the people, even the dumb ones.

It's fine for him to do that, even though it's a wonder why he'd host such a specific platform. SJWs are the enemy, yes, but so are ethnic nationalists. Why can't Warsky leave these fuckers to their own devices? Why can't Warsky stick to principle and tell them to build their own platform? And on a side note, why would anyone find it necessary to make a great leap backward just to spite the SJW crowd rather than help fight for the soul of the left? SJWs are not the soul of the left-wing.He would probably charge at least 1000/houroh fuck thanksThat works, thanks! God, what a delusional fucking moron.

&gt; [He has said he is “happy to slaughter” millions of of drug users and dismissed the deaths of children as “collateral damage”.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/16/philippines-police-bloodiest-night-duterte-war-drugs)

Wouldn't be surprised if Dave Rubin said something spicy on Duterte as Trump has praised him, where as Duterte criticized both the EU and Obama (personally, calling him a "son of a whore").

I don't have time to Google anything right now. It's not and his laughably bad matches are on YouTube along with his gaming conversation ironically about The Bungie Game Destiny https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=2661s&amp;v=rdwraRl26jc but he's a compulsive bullshitter tell multiple people he was black. But really his fear is probably that he bullied people in these backyard wrestling federations and someone will do a real dox. He has a bully nature so I wouldn't be surprised if there's not tonnes of shit about him out there.He's not that bright though he didn't know the difference between Liberal, Socalist and Communist he is also barely literate and he inflates everything from his past association to Jeff Holiday (which was failure and warski really) to his repeated claims of not being in the Sceptic Community, then screams at the Kilroy people. Really he's a sad wannabe of Keemstar but lacks the timing the IQ or patience to do drama well.Look at all the canned responses from alt righters in the comments there. They claim to think for themselves and yet they sound exactly the same.Real question guys. At what point do we stop giving these guys any credit? Andy is clearly incompetent in running his own show, this is his bread and butter and he still can not do it right. He found Jared Taylor but was unable to find any relevant opposition outside of a random twitter user that clearly has a bias in his username. 

Just beyond stupid. He clearly does not even know of anyone who can intelligibly argue against race realism, because he has not researched any opposition or looked into their ideas. Why do we keep beating a dead horsefiber cables are pretty much everywhere now, they have been laid out over the last decade. i dont know if a better type of cable is possible. there are websites like: https://www.eindelijkglasvezel.nl/waar-glasvezel/ on which you can express your interest in it and if there is a lot of interest in it they will get to your neighborhood quicker to lay down the new cables. on the site it states that 2 million households have been connected. which is about 6 million (assuming 3 people per household) out of the 16 million people so far Give her a chance. She is pretty cool, whatever her voice is like.&gt; Only issue is getting fiber across the US is going to take longer and be more expensive than getting fiber across the Netherlands,

this should be a state regulated thing and states that have more need for fast internet would be investing more. very rural states shouldnt be investing massively imoyou cannot economically push but you can push with your area to get it quicker. different ISPs offer different packages depending on whats available. i can choose from 18 packages from 12 isps. not sure if that answers your last questionthey dont own any of the infrastructure that enters the consumers house. I dont know where the ISP's get into the process exactly because i dont know enough about internet, but if my ISP would disappear tomorrow i can have another ISP this weekI was wondering the same.&gt;(not instantly, but as a result of pushing the button, and even someone who may not be born yet)

So you want to give rights to non existent people?I'm in agreement with Singer. I think personhood, but at the very least some type of sentience, is what is necessary for moral consideration on this question. Neither of these are present in a zygote. &gt;How would you feel about being deleted at 1 year old?

I take Peter Singers position. If I had not attained personhood at 1 years old, then "I" really don't get a say.

&gt;You do exist as a zygote, how else did you get to the point you're at today?

This is a silly argument. I could just as easily say that you do exist a sperm and an egg, how else do you get to the point your at today? "You" are not merely just a collection of matter, "you" are a psychological construct. 
Also, your skin cells contain DNA. So would that mean you are comiting a genocide everytime you scratch some skin cells off your arm?I meant to say zygotes, but I do think that probably applies to infants as well.But then this is a faulty analogy becuase we all (or the vast majority of us anyway) attain personhood long before we reach the age of 20. So you essentially comparing the termination of a non person with the killing of a person.

&gt;then I'd ask you to show me at what stage in the pregnancy should we consider it, well, a person.

I don't know exactly. I mean I'm not a developmental psychologist or anything, but I prety much agree with Singers position here. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eCNz95E-3Wg


I think probably not. Atleast not in the same way we would normally think of these. I think they are pretty much acting on preprogrammed instincts at  these very early stages of development. Ya, higher than brain dead is good start.Really? I think he's way more handsome now OuOI, as an egg, wouldn't have wanted to bleed out onto a tampon.&gt;Biologically a zygote is just a bundle of cells, not tissue, 

What do you think tissue is?&gt;The cutoff being a zygote makes sense because prior to that point, there is no potential for human life.

What do you mean? The sperm in your balls and the eggs in your coworkers uterus are also potential human life. &gt;It's hard to find criteria for personhood

How about self awarness?&gt;Race is real? No shit.

It's actually not. Atleast not in humans anyway.Shouldn't the sensible left, the actual left, try to appeal to the young and ignorant? At least reach out to them?From wikipedia. 

&gt;In biology, tissue is a cellular organizational level between cells and a complete organ.Why else did you think I held this position?A sleeping person is still a person.I don't think I'd have a problem with euthanasia. No, because a person is defined as a being that has a sense of itself existing over time. We all go to sleep with the expectation that we will wake up.  And besides, we are usually dreaming when we are sleeping anyway. Sorry, I didn't mean to say that it's the only criteria, just that it's one of the criteria.  I worded that poorly. Well if if he is on life support and brain dead then anything we could meaningfully call "destiny" has already died.  Keeping his body alive and function when the person inside is gone would be a waste of precious resources. it had become a breakfast routine for me to read whatever Steven was arguing about the night before on Twitter - now I have to scour the Twitters of all the other lefty ppl to find anything juicyEverytime you jerkoff, you are killing millions of potential people.Well put. 

I often use intoxication as an example. Is someone too intoxicated to engage is sexual activity after one sip of beer? Obviously not. But is somoneone too intoxicated after 20 beers in one night? Almost certainly yes. Just becuase the exact point between intoxication and non intoxication may be unclear doesn't mean there aren't very obvious states of intoxication and non intoxication.Haha, #baited ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)&gt;then you're responsible for ending the process and killing the fetus which would have become a baby if you didn't intervene.

How could you possibly know it wouldn't have ended in a miscarriage?Why is neuron formation the cut off point? Well you said that it would have become a baby if not for intervention. You couldn't possibly know this. I didn't say it did, I'm simply pointing out that your claim was wrong.I would argue the difference is outside of the womb you have a lot of less violent options to remove the suffering caused by the child from your life. Putting the child up for adoption for example.

My argument remains that your obligation to care for your child does not trump your right to self defense. Of course you can't use more violence than neccessary.

And I'm not considering the fetus an invader, I'm drawing an analogy.Thank you!!!I thought it was implicit that we are discussing unwanted pregnancies here. I agree that my argument does not hold for women who become pregnant on purpose.

To keep the burglar analogy alive I would characterise an unwanted pregnancy as "participating in an activity that has a chance of your house getting invaded". In pregnancy language that can range from trusting a man to pull out on time over contraception failure all the way up to getting raped. I would argue none of this is analogous to inviting an intruder into your home.

Let's put some numbers on it. Taking the worst contraception method: 4% of women who rely on the pull-out method get pregnant. The rate of households that get burglarized is about 1% per year. Those numbers are pretty comparable. An unwanted pregnancy is as much 'inviting a burglar into your house' as living in the united states is inviting a burglar into your house.Yeah but he doesn't really title the Vods with the debates and he sometimes turns the stream on and off during different parts of the day when he does different content. But that's not even true. Around 40 percent of al pregnancies end in miscarriages. And why does it matter when the information is "gathered"? That seems to me to be just another arbitrary step on the road to your existence as a person.It seems to me that you want to discuss if abortion is moral or not, but I just wanted to present and discuss this one argument. If you find other arguments more compelling that is entirely fine, I'm just myself right now not interested in weighing arguments against each other.The only reason I broght it up is because you said this 

&gt;If you end the process at any point after fertilization then you're responsible for ending the process and killing the fetus which would have become a baby if you didn't intervene.

And then this

&gt;I would maybe change my stance if someone could counter argue my last point.
Begging the question?

Could you give an example?

Edit:NM I just watched that video. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Defense_of_AbortionWell I did counter that point so...This doesn't answer my question.  Why does it matter when the information is "gatherd"?She might be dumber than Aydin and far less relevant. 

BTW, Hi crazy Patricia.My favorite tweet was the one where she said she cucked us cause him going for "food" was him talking to her. I really hope it's not true cause Destiny can do way better.No one cares about your opinion. Go away. Go shout your paranoid fantasies into a pillow or something.&gt;it's the absolute start of a human being. 

You are going to have to define your terms.I can't remember what his position on minimum wage is.You actually think I would have found what I was looking for on a subreddit other than Destiny's?........Lmao that'd be funny. Could get people to take the quiz before talking to you as a litmus test hahaYes omg I was so worried Jesus Christ thank you for this! You saved my life!Ya, but neurons don't necessarily mean consciousness. A person in a coma, or even a brain dead person still has neurons. I think most neurologists will tell you that before 24 weeks a fetus lacks the nural development that is necessary for consciousness, and even when it begins to develope consciousness, that it would be on the level of something like a crustacean. It's simple when explained properly. If I were to critique a story element in a fantasy novel, and you tried to refute my criticism by using logic from the novel, you'd be engaging in this fallacy.

Example: I think vampires are stupid. Why the hell does garlic make them weak? It's ridiculous.

Dumbass: Well no it's because vampires' olfactory systems are hyper sensitive to pungent smells because of their evolutionary biology over the course of hundreds of centuries, so you're the stupid one.

So to sum it up in other words, it's illogical to use an imaginary narrative to defend itself, when the criticism is coming from a bigger picture, i.e. meta, perspective.

Hope that helpedI now know how Destiny feels when he reads something really stupid in the chat lolI want to know Destiny's take on strict lines versus fluid spectrums between two binary states.

He seems convinced that human life is separated by a strict line while genders (assuming there are two) are on a spectrum.

I haven't made a strong enough internal argument for me to straight up challenge Destiny on this, but it would be interesting to know his opinion. One talking-point could be in that assessing human life, we already accept killing lives that don't inhabit enough traits (e.g 'pulling the plug'). I don't think it's pretentious to assign a name to a concept for the sake of convenience, and I stated in the very next sentence that it probably already has a name that I am ignorant of. I never claimed that I invented the *concept*.

I absolutely have tried Googling for the correct name, but when you don't know what something is called it is sometimes very difficult to discover. I think you've demonstrated this yourself, since the Category Error you've linked does **not** describe the same phenomenon that I am talking about, or even come anywhere close to it.

I have just now gone back and re-read it in case I had missed something the first time. No. I don't believe they are the same at all. It's possible that I've constructed Category Errors within my examples in order to highlight the problems with categorisation at all, but the *point* of what I was saying is separate.

Whereas the Category Error you've linked concerns itself with whether or not something has been incorrectly placed within a box representing one category when they really should have been in a different one, the phenomenon I'm describing is the where the entire concept of a category ceases to make any sense because the line between two 'distinct' categories is impossible to define.To me the moral responsibility of the 'attacking' party bears no influcence on the validity of self-defence. The logic of self-defence is equally warranted against unconscious, under-aged, inanimate or animal 'attackers' even if we wouldn't call it 'defence' in some of these scenarios. That is to point 1.

Then there is one little thing I need to point out about the 'orgasm-button' analogy. I think it's worthy to point out that the chance of a negative outcome is not 1-4% per button press, but 1-4% in a life-time of button-pressing.

The rest of your argument, though strong, hinges on the notion of implicit consent. And I reject the notion of implicit consent entirely.

Gambling in a casino is not implicit consent to losing your money - it is explicit consent. Now walking to a casino carries a certain risk of getting mugged, right?

Would you say accepting that risk by walking to the casino makes you consent to getting mugged and therefore invalidates your right to self-defence against the mugger? You could have gambled at home or online instead.

I think you would argue that the mugger carries responsibility and therefore the situation is not analogous, so I will throw you some more.

1. I like wandering in the woods, but there is a chance of getting attacked by a bear. Although I'm taking some precautions not to get attacked by a bear, the chance is still unequal to zero. Did I now consent to dying in a bear attack, or do I still pack my rifle to defend myself in the worst case? 

2. Most social -especially public- interactions carry a certain risk of contracting a parasitic desease. Although you take precautions not to catch anything, the risk remains non-zero. If you're going out anyway, did you now consent to have your body be host to parasites and therefore are not justified in taking anti-parasite medication that kills the parasites?

3. You want to buy something you could easily order online, but you decide you want to drive to a store. Participating in traffic comes with the risk of getting into an accident, which you are well aware of. On your way to the store there is a truck accident happening in front of you. There is no time to stop your vehicle, but you could evade to the side-walk, where there is a person standing there, which would certainly be killed in that case. Would you argue that by participating in traffic you consented to take the full harm of any accident on yourself, therefore foreiting your right to take any self-preservating measures that result in the death of others?

My point is not that these situations are analogous to unwanted pregnancy (although they have instructive parallels), my point is generally you do not consent to things that happen to you, even if you participate in behaviour that increases the risk.Free speech doesn't mean unopposed speech, cocksucker.Warski is too pussy to actually debate Destiny.He's only serving court papers. It's his job.The point was, if I understood you correctly, that you argued when someone consents to something happening to them, they then lose their right to do harm to any uninvolved party in trying to prevent that thing from happening. So to your argumentation it matters very much what is considered 'consent'.

That doesn't matter though, I think, and I hope you agree, we were able to chrystallize our difference to this form:

A person is knowingly and voluntarily entering an avoidable situation where there is a risk that the person has to chose between their own physical and mental safety and the life of an uninvolved stranger who had no choice in being in the situation.

You would say the person has to take the damage themselves, because the risk was completely avoidable by them.

While I would say the person still has the right to protect themselves over others applying the usual rules for self-defence. (Which in Destinys case include shooting someone for stealing a saxophone)

Would you say that is an accurate summary?

In light of that, I would like to tweak the traffic example a little and I would like to see if that changes your reaction.

The person on the sidewalk is now a baby in a carrycot who obviously had no cognitive capacity of deciding to be there.

How would you evaluate that situation and the descision to get into the car in the first place?An arbitrary line can still be strict, can it not? You probably have arbitrary strict lines everywhere in your society based specifically on age, like drinking limit. 

The spectrum in this case wouldn't be to acknowledge that there are different stages from a sperm to a born human, but rather that a fetus is not the same degree of life as a born child.

It's not like Destiny picked the end of the spectrum. I'd imagine abstination comes down to a similar moral argument for example – as well as the more troll-like argument such as "masturbation is murder". Just like Destiny, I realize that whether you are for or against – the pragmatic answer will be the dominant one. For this reason I don't find it interesting to simply discuss one or the other. 

Going back to my original question, the aspect I care about is justifying why gender is fluid *while* life is strict.Exactly. The hypocrisy is what bothers me the most. I just can't stand double standards no matter what side it's coming from. I actually used to like Andy, even if I couldn't take him seriously. But now I just think he's sucking the alt-right cock like there's no tomorrow.Sure, the gossiping seems to be happening all around. I'm not on any particular side either, I like to watch a good shit show. I just couldn't believe the tactics these guys were using and how low Andy would sink just to be considered "one of the guys". It's so obvious that he really wants these people to like him. Andy acts like he's been "speaking the truth" since the whole Kraut debacle happened, but all he did was switch to another team. It's retarded.Keep reinforcing your paranoid fantasies, there.I will admit that I enjoy Destiny's memeing and I love how much he pisses off these other youtubers just by virtue of existing haha.55:30 "Africa is a shithole" - literally worse than Trump. Oh, wait, is Destiny president of the United States?Zeta Gundam is classic. Those last 3 episodes... SweatStinyIs Haiti the capital of Africa?You say the number representing every information of the observable universe would be to big to be represented within the observable universe itself. That is only true if the observable universe is the smallest possible representation of that number, which I think would be surprising.

To illustrate what I mean: 

The number 10,000,000,000 is a line followed by  10 circles.

The representation 10^10 contains the same information, but takes less "ink" to "print".

*EDIT: The following part is wrong and embarrassing, so don't read it*
But there is another thing that is actually fundamentally wrong. You say, because entropy is increasing, the next number would be larger, but that is not true. Increasing entropy - the loss of order - is actually the *loss* of information!

Here is a simple example:

"This sentence is in order"

Me putting the letters in a specific order out of all the possible orders has very low entropy and conveys some information to you.

"er sitiien shrecse dTonn "

Me putting the letters in any random order - e.g. disorder - conveys about no information, but has the highest entropy.Hi, I'm at the moment myself working on a Master's degree in quantum physics and me and my colleagues do not believe that the universe is deterministic. The best quantum physics has to offer (and quantum physics is the best predictive theory we have) is a probabilistic description.

We can say "theres a x chance of X happening and a y chance of Y happening". When you say, based on the laws of physics it should be possible to predict the exact time of a nuclear decay, then that is not in accordance with our best understanding of physics at the moment. sorryYour two points sort of contradict each other.

The representation 10^10 is only possible because the number is low entropy.

Something with higher entropy would require more bits to express.

It's true from our perspective as entropy increases eventually the information becomes less meaningful, but that is because it has more information than is useful, not less.Well, in terms of how practically meaningful to us the number is, as the entropy increases the number would lose it's meaning.

But in terms of how many digits or bits you need to express the state, as entropy increases you need more. That is basically the definition of entropy I think.Time is a process that operates on a state and produces a new state. The parallel between that and computation is not my original idea. If you don't like it your argument is with Steven Wolfram not me.

I don't see how you have refuted my objection to eternalism at all.

I think I have demonstrated that, given how chaotic the universe is, you cannot store the subsequent states in the universe somewhere inside the universe as it currently is.

You might be saying it is safe and uncontroversial, but I am attempting to challenge that, because your only support is that the position is "safe and uncontroversial."

Where are these eternal states? How do you support the assertion that they exist?

edit: I don't think you should worry about sounding condescending. As long as you are engaged in the facts of the issue I don't really mind that. You should perhaps try to avoid sounding pedantic instead.That is right and I stand corrected. I retract my second point, you actually need a higher number to represent a less ordered state.

My first point still stands though, that the information in the universe might be reducible (well, until we hit maximum entropy in 10^(10^300) years).I am actually trying to demonstrate that is is both practically and theoretically impossible, by showing that successfully doing it would cause a paradox.

If you want to determine what is going to happen next in the universe, you need some way to represent that universe.

Given that "predicting things [is] difficult within certain domains of phenomena" as someone below delightfully put it, you need to represent the state of the universe you are in already if you want your prediction to be accurate.

However, this would require the state of the universe to contain a representation of itself, which would then need to contain a representation of itself, and this is would be a paradox.

So, it is only theoretically possible to do this if you do not think the magical machine needs to exist in this universe. I think this is an important distinction.

In my view, if you can demonstrate the magical machine cannot exist in this universe, you have also effectively demonstrated the magical machine cannot exist period.

edit: Perhaps I am not speaking carefully enough when I say the universe representing itself would be a paradox. I don't really know if I have completely proven a literal paradox yet in that particular situation. However, what has been demonstrated at least is the need for an infinite series of representations, each which must be more compressed than the last, because they would all need to be Russian dolled up inside the universe you are representing.

I don't think that alone shows a paradox, unless you also have the stipulation that the universe cannot be compressed. That is when you get the paradox. Nothing can contain an infinite amount of uncompressed representations of itself.Definitely agree with that, he seems much more lucid to me these days.Well, challenging that point is basically just a matter of going over the core argument.

If the universe is certainly reducible in terms of what parts of it we pay attention to.

For example we might abstract an entire gas just into a pressure, and in that sense it is very reducible.

But could some sort of reduction like that work for the actual universe itself? I don't think so.

My argument is that chaotic systems are going to be sensitive to things that we would prefer to abstract away, so if you want an accurate prediction you need the full entropy of the universe to know what will happen, not some reduced abstraction.

For example, you might abstract a gas into a pressure and a molecule count, but forget about the position of all the molecules. After all, that would require lots of entropy to record.

However, what if the entire gas was all neon, except one single molecule of xenon or something, and you have a very sensitive xenon detector somewhere in the room?

To predict when that detector is going to go off, the compressed version will not help. You cannot throw any of the entropy related to molecular position out and still predict the path of the xenon through all the neon.

So given that situations will occur where you cannot throw entropy away, it seems the universe cannot completely represent itself in some compressed way.

If this is not possible, it seems it would take an entire universe of entropy to (in a completely deterministic way) represent the universe, and nothing less.

edit:

Furthermore, given that there are fundamental limits on how much you can determine, this is where the compatiblism comes in. You cannot avoid surprises, things will occur that could not have been predicted. Given that things will happen without knowable causes, free will is therefore not impossible. Shit troll is shit trollHe's 20 at most since he was 19 at the Charlottesville Rally.Was he pro or anti GG back when it happened?Well I don't see how I am peddling misinformation. I am accurately representing the view of every professor I have talked to. So i don't see how I 'should know better' either. Because I haven't read an article that was published literally 14 days ago?

You seem to have put a lot of thought into this issue and I freely admit that I haven't yet. I didn't realise there was controversy on this point, because literally every physicist I talked to agreed with what I wrote. (albeit in a simplified manner)

So, do you think you can explain to a newby like me, if the probabilistic calculational framework of quantum mechanics is necessary to make sense of experimental data, how is it not the best description physics has to offer?

Isn't empiricism the ultimate scientific standard for truth?

And if I drop the E-E link, which I have absolutely zero problem with, isn't the wavefunction, evolving unitarily, still a probability distribution? So still probabilistic?So you say 'theoretically' possible in the sense that it hasn't been shown yet to be false? Ok.I think you are being too pedantic, and missing the point.

Believe it or not, I'm actually not trying to engage with the academic standard of cosmology.

My goal is to address the pop-science understanding of "pure determinism", that might be common on a forum for a popular streamer engaged that that kind of idea.

So, the universe I am describing in the post is not a cutting edge physics model. You may have noticed, that I have not made any reference to any sort of quantum phenomena, or anything probabilistic.

This is intentional. My point is, even in an the ideal toy model universe where everything is determined exactly by the previous state, there are going to be things that occur that were unknowable beforehand.

If events in the future are unknowable, then free will is not precluded by the deterministic process that creates the future.

Not necessarily unknowable from outside the universe, but certainly unknowable from inside the system where the things are being determined, or inside the previous state.

I think that point is pretty solid, and I don't think it's that controversial academically either.  Beyond that, talking about what is unknowable is just speculation either way, so it's true the part about the "infinite arms of creation" is sort of speculative.

Basically, all I want is non-compatibilists to understand that their position needs to make assumptions about how time works that are beyond verification.If you don't know anything about undecidability proofs, then you are the amateur, despite your posturing.

You have never explained why I should accept a magic extra-temporal perspective that transcends fundamental information limits in the universe as valid principle.

If you are such an expert, that should not be difficult.

edit:

You are being reckless of your use of practice vs principal. I am not trying to show that it's difficult to make a machine that predicts the future. I'm trying to explain that one could not possibly make such a machine while remaining inside the universe they are trying to predict.

This is a constraint in principle with the idea that doing such a thing is possible, not some practical roadblock that would make it difficult.

Honestly it just seems that you are just bristling because I don't follow the exact body of literature you do, and I am communicating in a way that is slightly different from what you are used to. I don't think you are making a good faith effort to address the substance of what I am saying.

&gt; The implication of chaos theory is that it makes predicting things difficult within certain domains of phenomena. That doesn’t change the fact that the underlying ontology would still be deterministic. If you’re just trying to say that we lack the ability to make perfect predictions in all situations, this is a rather banal point. Just because we don’t have Laplace’s demon doesn’t change the underlying deterministic physics.

I never made any claims that contradict this. I am claiming that Laplace's demon cannot exist. That is basically all I am claiming. This might seem obvious to you, and I commend you for your correct understanding in that area. The post is intended for people that think it does. &gt;Then I don't think you actually understand what is being posited by eternalism. States exist. They evolve according the laws of physics. There is no nested storing of information you suggest. The universe exists as a whole. The evolution equations tell you how to go from one state to another in a unique and determined way.

Good. So if the universe exists in this way, in what sense is the universe pre-determined?

Basically, what I am interested in is that the universe is capable of creating novel things. So, as the state of the universe evolves following those rules, things will come to exist that have not existed before.

Where do they come from? That is basically the question. It is possible to completely understand the rules involved, but it doesn't really answer that question. And physics doesn't completely understand the rules involved, so as far as I can tell it's pretense ontop of pretense.

A human idea or action might be completely new in the universe. In fact, it's pretty easy to string together a series of words that have never been written before. It's quite difficult not to in fact.

Given that the state of the universe simply is, as you say, and its evolving over time producing new things, as it does, in what sense are these new things that enter the world "pre-determined"?

Basically, what I am saying is that I don't think the universe operating this way makes free will impossible, because new forms and structures come to exist, and entropy increases.

Basically my question is this. How do you know that none of the new information in the universe with each moment is not a result of a free choice?

That is basically the question. If there is a situation in the universe that has not occurred before, it seems the only thing to do is observe what happens and then try to modify theory to accommodate the result.

This is basically the entire point of experimentation.

Given our ignorance, and the fact that we are obligated to throw away theories when they are contradicted by nature, how are you in a position to dictate to nature that it is not, or could not be making free choices?

It's true the bounds of the choices do seem to be increasingly confined, at least when it comes to the physics involved. It's probably rare that there will be some novel particle interaction at this point. But why would that scarcity translate to larger scales, where novel situations are the norm and not the exception?

How do you know there isn't a phase transition?Yay more communism memes [](/SLEEPSTINY) [](/SLEEPSTINY) [](/SLEEPSTINY) [](/SLEEPSTINY) [](/SLEEPSTINY) [](/SLEEPSTINY) [](/SLEEPSTINY) [](/SLEEPSTINY) [](/SLEEPSTINY) [](/SLEEPSTINY) [](/SLEEPSTINY) [](/SLEEPSTINY) [](/SLEEPSTINY) [](/SLEEPSTINY) [](/SLEEPSTINY) Well, what are the laws of physics? 

As the universe evolves, you will encounter moments where the laws of physics, as they were thus far, are not going to be able to predict what happens, and they must be expressed in greater detail than they were before.

For example, right when the universe started, the fundamental forces were unified. This is because lower energy situations where you would be able to differentiate between different fundamental forces had not yet occurred.

So, at that point, when gravity, strong, weak, electromagnetic, all the forces were unified, using just observations of the universe in that state, would it be possible to determine what laws of physics you were going to get?

Basically the idea is from that same high energy plasma, it's conceivable you could get a different universe from the one we have now, where the singular force would break apart into different forces than the ones we have now.

I think as the universe continues to evolve, the laws involved need to become increasingly subtle. For example the universe might proceed according to laws, but we don't know completely how the laws are going to be expressed moving forward.

So, our universe could be identical to another, but they will diverge at some point in the future because of some very very subtle difference in the laws of physics that has not had a chance to be expressed yet.

Given this, how do we know that this is the only way the laws could have been expressed? How do we know that the universe did not "decide" to follow the particular variety of laws it follows now through some complex process?

Basically I am saying, if we don't know that, we can't know there is no free will.

edit: Basically the laws of physics as we understand it don't preclude free will because our understanding is not complete. This is actually completely independent of the point I was trying to make, but it's a much easier point to make, and I'm only making it now because I'm sort of annoyed by the physics pedant that popped in, and started grilling me on my toy example as if I proposing a new kind of physics.

The point I wanted to make was to assume that there was a completely deterministic and completely understood universe, and argue that even in that case you can still argue for compatibilism. This I think is the more interesting philosophical point, and it's actually much harder to do. I suppose I should have made that more clear.

I might take another shot at that later.


When did I ever bring up communism? 
&gt; crony capitalism

My response would be... well that is just capitalism. The system itself doesn't really have any inherent method to eliminate such issues. Trust busting isn't a part of capitalism, strict regulations again, not an inherent aspect of it.

&gt; If these organizations weren't so embedded in government would these problems still exist?

In theory I would like to see certain aspects become part of the government. USPS is an amazing system and is the best parcel carrier in the world. The main reason being that they don't have to worry about costs since profit is not their main driver. Their main goal is to deliver parcels in a short period of time for a low cost. Certain aspects of human life explicitly need to have the profit motive eliminated from them.  I'm actually really annoyed by this&gt; Things are never viewed as inherent problems, they're simply seen as problems that capitalism can variously address.

Regulations are a check on capitalism and not a part of it. I really don't see how one could try to save the system and not talk about regulations. 

&gt; But then, as you start to do that, you have another problem, which is Destiny's entire approach to understanding things which is massively liberal... the "hey just show me the data" approach is naive and ultimately stupid.

I mean I am trying to address capitalism and not explicitly advocating any other system, also I am directly addressing Destiny, I kinda have to play to his game. I would have a presented a different opinion if it wasn't addressing Destiny. 

&gt; The rest of your points

I don't really disagree with much of what you have said. I do disagree a bit that I still don't really see Destiny as actually holding any tangible liberal views. 


Also, I think the best critique of capitalism in my post is Part III. Honestly read the article and listen to the podcast. What JPMorgan Chase did is the most capitalist thing they could have done, and they have yet to face any actual consequences. You really can't look at that story and come out saying JPMorgan Chase isn't just an evil company that needs to go.&gt; How do you prove the entire system alienates you?

Read the TL:DR article.

&gt; if you work hard and live frugal then you can help give your kids an edge in life you may not have had. 

This is actually pretty untrue atm. It really depends on a lot of things, what school district you live in, if you can actually have a savings account, that you have a 'good' job that you can retain for years to come. That you have healthcare that actually can provide the healthcare. 

I mean the US is currently the most expensive place to have a child with 3rd world level mortality rates for the child. Shits pretty fucked. If an egg and a sperm don't have the potential to develope into a person, how did you come into existence? Are you an AI?&gt; Isn't competition an inherent way the system can correct itself?

Okay, compete with Uber/AirBnB/Amazon/JPMorgan Chase/Facebook. Good Luck?

I mean unless your business model is inherently designed to be illegal you will never be able to compete with Uber/AirBnB. 

Unless you have an insane amount of money to dump into like everything you will never compete with Amazon. I mean take a step back and think about how many industries they are a part of. I don't think anyone would be able to compete with them? 

Competition is great, up until a single company more or less has more market power than the rest of their competition combined, if there is even anyone left to compete with. 

&gt; Maybe we should just nationalize industries where competition is near impossible or redundant like utilities.

I would agree, however that means capitalism has failed, thus we agree on my main premise. Whelp, yeah I don't think I will be able to change Destiny's mind. I do think providing examples and stats like this could at least pull him closer to a Soc Dem. I mean at this point I would accept any movement off of his current view of capitalism. 

&gt; You need to be ok with fucking seizing or otherwise destroying or disrupting their property using collective action in a potentially (inevitably) politically violent way, either through the state or mob.

Shush... I am trying to talk to Destiny just about the issues with capitalism not my ideas. XDThe term 'alt-right' is becoming meaningless. Is every criticism of a liberal politician or policy 'alt-right'? Where on /r/canada do you see any trace of white nationalism?Those people are **not eating english muffins**, they are **not wearing big furry hats** and they are **not singing God Save the Queen.** It's basically Syria.&gt;An egg or sperm don't have the assured potential to develop.

Neither does a zygote!

&gt;I'm sure you can't even define personhood.

How about a conscious entity that is self aware and has a sense of itself existing over time in that it can imagine the past and the future?

I don't even see any half-blown white supremacy. Just the same range of comments that you'd see anywhere. I don't want to alarm you but I feel like you may be living in an echo chamber. Some real good capitalist arguments right here my dude 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/7uw0e7/the_inherent_problems_of_capitalism/Yeah that's the kinda stuff I'm talking about. Like even if JF wasn't guilty of anything, they refuse to even give it an objective assessment.im gonna be real with u chief... im gonna treat contra with so much love and respect when we get married Don’t worry dude I’ll give you an up vote for pointing that out. That shit made me laugh.I linked it b/c I thought it was funny and it was the post directly below mine in the new section. Also I didn't down or upvote anyone in this thread. &gt; Amazon they beat the book stores

Book stores still exist. I mean they helped destroy a lot of locally owned ones and they sure have forced others to adapt to their policy, but again who can attempt to compete with Amazon?

&gt; Amazon again they beat the supermarkets

Where did Amazon do anything revolutionary in the supermarket industry? I am very curious to what you mean here. You get an up vote for the meme&gt; market failures

What would you define market failures as? It seems that people have different views of what this means.

Also when it comes to regulation, there is an entire political party within the US that sees the word regulation as a bad thing. There is a 3rd party that sees pretty much every regulation as a bad thing b/c it stifles the market. &gt; https://www.marklogic.com/blog/amazon-beating-retailers/

This doesn't really prove that Amazon has beaten the book stores. I mean they clearly have absorbed a large market, but they haven't ended the industry.


&gt; https://www.google.dk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/21/amazons-first-automated-store-opens-to-public-on-monday

How does that have any real impact on the actual industry? Is this one store going to put every other one out of business? Does this one store end all the other contracts with food logistics companies and grocery stores? Not to mention that Amazon also uses 3PL's for their food deliver services within cities. Amazon opening up a single store doesn't mean it either will be successful at all let alone enough to upend the entire industry. 

I mean we could go into a side topic about the food industry and the different industries that it encapsulates. I mean no single company has come to been able to dominate the food industry. That's fine, I mostly watch him.&gt; I’m not sure how to take these statements. There are no fundamental physics/cosmology models I know of that describe time in this way. Do you intend to convey the orthodox idea that time is just a label on some physical state and the translation between those states is according to some set of unitary dynamics? If that’s what you meant, it’s not implied in what you said. If my rephrasing is what you meant I would consider revising your statement because what you did say is confused to say the least.

I don't think I came out of the gate saying "Time is a computer". I believe what I said was "time is a computation", and worked my way to "time is a computer" just as a pedagogical technique to briefly touch on the previous point before moving on to something else.

This is the definition of computation "Computation is any type of calculation that includes both arithmetical and non-arithmetical steps and follows a well-defined model understood and described as, for example, an algorithm.

The study of computation is paramount to the discipline of computer science."

I would challenge you to apply some unitary dynamics to a set of physical states and dodge that definition.

&gt; Again, what do you mean by this? Chaos theory doesn’t “make determinism hard” (whatever that means). The implication of chaos theory is that it makes predicting things difficult within certain domains of phenomena. That doesn’t change the fact that the underlying ontology would still be deterministic. If you’re just trying to say that we lack the ability to make perfect predictions in all situations, this is a rather banal point. Just because we don’t have Laplace’s demon doesn’t change the underlying deterministic physics.

I am actually feeling much better about this critique because I realized you have a good point here. Saying Chaos is "what makes determinism hard" when I was talking about "hard determinism" is actually super confusing.

I agree. This should have been phrased better. I was actually trying to communicate that predictions become very difficult in certain domains, yes.

I agree, it is a banal point to say we cannot make predictions in situations like that, speaking practically. I think it's a less banal point to say there is no universal prediction process that could exist, because it will fail in some cases. That is an assertion in principle, and I think it would be true regardless of our practical constraints.

&gt; From reading the above, I have to wonder if you have any technical experience in physics or philosophy of physics at all. You’re stumbling around very old and well defined philosophical concepts and inventing problems where they don’t exist. You don’t have to assume the “next number exists in some platonic abstract sense” you just have to be a member of “Eternalism” camp, which is a relatively safe and uncontroversial stance to take in contemporary cosmology.

Is that the only camp then? Why would it be such a radical thing to advocate for a different camp?

&gt;Stop confusing the numbers used to describe physical states with the physical states themselves. If you did that, a lot of your confusion would go away. As far as this language of “crawling along” goes, you might benefit from reading the contemporary literature of how physicists are attempting to develop a coherent and self-contained explanation/mechanism for the so-called “arrow of time”. If you’re already familiar with this stuff (which I doubt, given your scattershot summary of the relevant concepts), wouldn’t your time be better spent coming up with solutions to the past hypothesis and the measure problem rather than speaking loosely about how time is a computer…or something?

Suppose the universe is deterministic and finite, doesn't it follow that, in principle, the state can be completely represented with numbers? What is the difference? Why would it be impossible to represent something that is deterministic and finite with numbers?

Should I have specified that I am assuming it is finite?

I would appreciate more explanation about the error you think I am making here. And less randomly sprinkled in insults.I don't think we use spectrum and line in the same way. Let me try to explain it using sex/gender and how Destiny has argued against it on stream:

Sex has a strict line. You can either have a penis or a vagina.

Gender is fluid. You first glance you might want to say that anything "a penis" does is male and vice versa, but you'll notice there is overlap. However, you can recognize that gende *either* is a spectrum between female/male; or say that it's strict. *If you draw a strict line in the spectrum you are not defining gender as a spectrum.**

You can of course say you see the gender spectrum but draw a strict line as you see fit – maybe I was unclear here – but that would be "strict, not a spectrum" in my book. im not subbed jordan peterson, I was trying to get Jordan Peterson to debate Jared Taylor, a white collectivist who would destroy him, moron.Warski hasnt gotten banned even though hes had him only like 10 times. Destiny has no excuseIf its so hard to identify what is white, how do they do it for affirmative action? How do lefties do it for "white privilege". How do we do it for "diversity". You people are stupid as fuckHe's either an idiot, a Nazi or a Nazi apologist.If you want to use your definition and not mine, then you obviously have to redefine my question. Otherwise the discussion becomes rather pointless.

[Edit: To be clear, I'm here assuming that you draw a strict line as close as possible to the blue end of the spectrum – essentially saying that your moral evaluation is binary and not really on a spectrum. Similarly, if everything born with a penis is gendered male and vice versa, proclaiming that you've actually used a spectrum to determine the gender isn't meaningful]

If we use your spectrum, I'm interested in knowing why the beginning of your spectrum is arbitrarily given extra weight compared to any other point inside the spectrum.

Do you even treat it like a spectrum? It would seem that you treat it like an switch that is either on or off – abortion is murder, period — where as I would treat it as something fluid.

Abortion is not neutral but sometimes it's necessary. However, using day-after pill or early abortion is not morally equal to late abortion – because the morality is on a spectrum.

In my spectrum the fetus approaches the status of a living human. What is described to me is a spectrum of fetus development – not moral consideration or some kind of measurement of being "worthy" of life. It was probably just that. I defined line as the barrier between the two, but I realize you can also picture the spectrum as a line. I don't know if people meme when they say he is addicted, but I genuinely believe he is, and that the net enjoyment for him is negative.

Posting what I posted in a previous thread:

&gt;The last time he was banned and quit he said he was happy about it so that he didn't have to play anymore. Why didn't he quit before?

&gt;He's constantly going on about how he hates the game.

&gt;The smallest setback sets him up for massive tilt.


Does this seem like a man who enjoys League? Am I the only one considering the possibility that Destiny has a serious addictive problem with League, that outright negatively affects his psyche and quality of life? If this is the case, are we to encourage the continuation of this? Should we not help Destiny find a way out of it? I think MrMouton who keeps perpetuating Destiny's addictive behavior should think long and hard about what effects he has on someone he considers a friend. &gt; You guys parrot the "no-true-communism" meme non-stop

Please point me to where I am advocating for communism? Do you even see the word in the main post? &gt; And that is a good thing, don't you agree?

Well those industries have other issues that I could go on about. 

&gt; Well they don't have to be a 100% or even dominate the market, to show how new companies can come in and solve problems in sectors with long established rich companies

The main issue that I point out is that Amazon isn't really entering that actual industry. They are just providing an end product through the exact same methods that already dominate the industry. They use the same 3PLs who already control large aspects of the supply chain, so they aren't solving any problems at all. That is my problem.

In the end, Amazon Fresh is just a more expensive product that you would purchase at any grocery store in your area. That isn't close to solving a problem, it is using the existing system to try and get any slice of the pie. &gt; but it comes off like petulant millennial bitching. 

Did you look into any of the sources? I mean they clearly prove that this isn't about millennials bitching this about a system that has turned against helping them. I would suggest looking at [this graph](http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/poor-millennials-print/media/images/class-of-oh-no.png). Please tell me how that would be b/c of one person's bitching? You can look into the cost of tuition, how loans were reformed to literally be predatory. You can look at what millennials could expect out of their 401K. All of this has is a fraction of what others have seen before them. 


I can't really read that statement and think you gave the thread an actual read through. 

&gt; It's seems like a loose collection of semi-related subjects that is somehow supposed to signify the downfall of capitalism and I just don't see how it all connects.

I will connect the dots for you then. 1998 - Student Loans reclassified to nondischargeable debt -&gt; Student loans are never a bad investment for the lender -&gt; College Tuition Increases even though most public colleges have hundreds of millions of dollars -&gt; 2008 mortgage crisis that almost sinks the economy -&gt; Jobs start to disappear -&gt; The gig economy jobs appear -&gt; Shit jobs with not benefits become 33% of the job market -&gt; Students still have large loans but now w/o a decent job -&gt; With all of that debt they aren't able to get a home loan -&gt; Not able to buy a house. 


As to how this is supposed to signify the "downfall of capitalism". Please look into the [recent polls](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/04/26/a-majority-of-millennials-now-reject-capitalism-poll-shows/?utm_term=.aa1c9fd91ab9) concerning millennials and their view of capitalism. There **HAS** to be a reason that they are rejecting it right? I mean what could the other reason be? 

&gt; Most of our innovation comes from the private sector seeking profit which has resulted in the improvement of our lives.

That is not even true in the slightest. The most successful company ever Apple can thank the public sector for developing all of the crucial aspects of the iPhone that they put into a single unit and had the public pay again for the innovation they already paid for in tax dollars. [Please look into this article and the video within it.](https://info-war.gr/fake-or-not-this-iphone-was-made-by-the-public-sector-not-free-market-capitalism/)

&gt; There may be corrupt practices and growing pains like what you described. Those just seem like a blip in the grand scheme of things though. 

Please explain to me how JPMorgan Chase is a blip on the map. They literally used the methods that sunk the economy in 2008 to repay the billions they owed for fucking it up again? How is this anything like a growing pain and not how they system is laid out? 

Please explain how Uber/AirBnB are growing pains when their entire business model was subverting the "growing pains" we have already seen and dealt with through regulation? 

&gt; We probably live in the best era of peace and prosperity in all of human history, why should we drastically change from market economies which have been proven to work?

How can you say that we are seeing peace b/c of the current market economics? I mean all evidence points to the current system not really helping a newer generation. It is almost like the system was doing very good until a certain generation  came into power and changed the system to continuously benefit them.It's astonishing how many insecure dudes use "soy boy" as an insult now. It's just projection at the highest levels.&gt; but he anti-capitalism people always recommend communism as the solution, which it isn't.

Whelp, as I have asked others please direct me to where I advocate for any other system within the main post? 

&gt; So when you are talking about socialism you are still talking about markets right? Like in germany where we have a social market economy, which tries to have freedom but also social balance.

Not advocating for any other system, that isn't the message of the main post. 

&gt; There are some domains where a free market is just horrible due to bad incentives and extremely lopsided bargaining power.

That would be for example health care and prison systems.

I would and might actually write pieces for many different entire industries. Food for example is an industry that has been completely fucked by capitalism and the for profit view.  

&gt; (you can't expect them not to act this way or they will lose in the competition) 

This statement is the main reason as to why I wrote this post and why I addressed it directly at Destiny. 

&gt; Well a monopoly would almost always be one

That is not necessarily true. 

&gt; I don't think Republicans sees every regulation as bad, but rather that regulation is a bad thing that is necessary sometimes, my argument would be that regulation can do great things, but unless you have a demonstrated problem you should be careful, since many things sorts themselves out.

The issue there is that the Republicans are often opposed to many regulations that will not just sort themselves out without the end of either the human race or at least where we live and the way of life we currently have.LOL. have you never heard of 23andme?. Also its not like everyone part of the hispanic group or black group or asian group have the exact same genes, but theyre allowed to collectivized? Why is living in proximity to white people a human right? But when we want to advocate for ourselves, THEN whiteness doesnt exist? We just arent a people? Brainwashed RETARDDon't even get me started on Steven Bonnell fans. Autism incarnate.hey retard, Obama literally tried to diversify white neighborhoods. I wonder if he would ever do that for non white, homogeneous areas.

Diversify literally means to make less white. A 100% Hispanic neighborhood would not be forced to take in anyone

https://www.truthorfiction.com/president-obamas-plan-diversify-suburbs/

You people dont know what youre talking about.

And the whole "You cant have a group of white people because ITS NOT BLACK AND WHITE ENOUGH FOR ME". Is retarded. If I have 10% black in me, do I qualify for affirmative action then?


Also, even if I could just suddenly have the money to engage in white flight (which we shouldnt have too, since this was a white country), That doesnt stop me from having to pay for all the immigrant's government assistance and children's education. But Why do we have to fuck over the white working class by flooding their neighborhoods with immigrants who hate them and bring crime? Youre a piece of shit

This country was founded and built FOR WHITE PEOPLE. The idea that it was built for the entire world to take advantage of is a lie. This country used to be 85% white, and because democrats decided to flood it with mexicans for easy votes, im now expected to move to a different country to be with my people?because you want to give this country to precious democrat foreigners? Fuck you&gt; Wait i thought you had a problem with capitalism, why wouldn't you call a monopoly a market failure?

Well, even before writing this point I have had an almost endless discussion with a few people in the discord trying to define what exactly is a market failure. So far we really haven't been able to get a single definition of what it is. That being said a monopoly in and of itself is not an inherent failure of the market within capitalism.

&gt; I don't understand what you mean, could you rephrase that

The EPA is currently being run by Scott Pruitt, a man who was an advocate of significantly reducing regulations concerning the environment. Since he has become the head of the EPA he is objectively harming the planet by making environmental regulations disappear. I don't see how these problems will sort themselves out without completely upending either human life in general, or how we currently live life. https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/7ux7dh/a_particular_affirmative_does_not_negate_a/

All I saw was these posts. I'm just repeating what I learned in Elementary Logic though.No, Gary has released two since he took over. It's just been like 8 months since the last one. &gt; I don't get exactly what you are trying to prove.

That after a massive recession you would expect the system to not intentionally sacrifice a generation in order to attempt to avoid addressing the underlying issues that created the problems. 

&gt; it was a failing of the government for not properly regulating it even when they had the chance

Everything that happened with the 2008 mortgage crisis was literal fraud. The private companies knew and the government regulators knew. The issue is that the profit was just too great for them to think otherwise. That is because short term gains became the goal. 

&gt; A lot of your post is centered around public education. Is your argument against the way the US government runs or capitalism?

I focused on education because of the TL:DR article and Destiny's recent statements about capitalism. Both of those kinda made me want to write this up. As I said in Part 5 there are many more industries where capitalism makes more of a mess than it does help.

&gt; Is your argument against the way the US government runs or capitalism? 

I mean can you separate the current government from the system it operates under?

&gt; Having student loan debt be non-dischargeable and having any student that wants it get a federal loan has skyrocketed tuition prices. Demand has also skyrocketed with more people than ever going to college and a higher percentage of young people going to college than ever before. These seem like failings of the federal government to me, maybe you could shift some blame on to the private sector for creating this demand?

Well the underlying issue with the loans and the rising cost of tuition is that there is no reason for a lender to ever not lend money. The loans can't be defaulted. If you try the lender can garnish your wages. One way or another the lender will get its money back. It isn't a failure of the government per say, more like a failure of the system at large, IE capitalism. 

&gt; These rates have hit neared or already hit pre-recession levels and have been falling every year. I don't see it as a problem getting worse

Even if the economy was to bounce back to pre-recession numbers tomorrow the damage has been done. Wealth has disappeared from an entire generation and been replaced with insane levels of debt.

&gt; The housing market seems like a separate issue that is adversely affecting millennials. The problem being that all the good jobs are located in cities, but there is not enough room for everyone to have home ownership near the cities. Housing hasn't really changed much outside of cities and are still affordable, but the large millennial preference seems to be living in or near major cities.

Good jobs are near cities, but there is affordable housing not in the cities were the jobs are thus it isn't a problem?!?! I mean I know that zoning laws are important and as I said in the main post housing issues encompass many different issues that would have made the post much longer. It could be a post all on its own. 

&gt; Apple isn't the most successful company ever lol

Apple is often called the most "successful company" due to its stock price.

&gt; Innovation is built from the work of others, including the government and other private companies.

1st innovation is not exclusive to capitalism and 2nd you may cite a bunch of examples, but do you know how many of those private companies were funded through public money? The vast majority of technology innovation has either come directly from the public sector or through the public sector funding the private sector. I mean look at Elon Musk and his companies. He is a glorified government contractor. 

&gt; It's one individual case that has far reaching effects, but it's still small compared to capitalism as a whole. You're always going to have bad actors, it's up the government to de-incentivize it and punish that behavior. 

What JPMorgan Chase did isn't special to them. It is how the entire system operates. Also it is a clear indictment of capitalism considering that the government knew that they were Robosigning in order to pay of the billions they owed due to Robosigning in the first place. 

&gt; Same thing with Uber and AirBnB. I don't know what else you would describe their shortcomings as other than growing pains. You want us to go back to only using expensive hotels and taxis? How is that helping?

You do realize that hotel and taxi services are regulated because previous humans have already had to deal with the growing pains? AirBnB and Uber by design set up their companies to only be able to work so long as we forget why we wanted the regulation in the first place. I mean if the only two options I have are either using Uber/AirBnB or going back to Taxi/Hotels then I would choose taxi/hotels every single time. Those industries have been regulated for a reason. I mean idk about you but I don't want to a company to sell me food that doesn't follow regulations with regards to food safety. 

&gt; These companies exist because people want them to exist, it's pretty plain and simple.

This is not a compelling argument at all. People demanding sugary garbage to be in everything clearly hasn't been a good thing for them in the slightest.

&gt; Globally, people living in poverty has fallen tremendously since the industrial revolution

It is great that people aren't living in poverty, however you then need to ask the next question. What is their current life like? Have we really improved it to an acceptable level, or have their lives improved simply b/c capitalists saw them as a cheaper form of labor to exploit? 

&gt; Food prices have fallen dramatically over time

This is a very tricky issue that I will probably address in another post but I would argue that the prices would fall regardless of capitalism. 

&gt; Disease is being treated and eradicated more over time

Again, what does this have to do with capitalism? Did humans not try to prevent disease and death before we figured out profit? 

&gt; Charitable giving has risen over time

What does this have to do with capitalism? Why should people rely on charity? How would charity ever be more effective than a system set up to combat the problem? 

&gt; Crime has fallen substantially over time

What does this have to do with capitalism? I mean if you are going to talk about crime why not address that the US has the largest prison population per capita? Why not address the slue of other problems inherent to the private prison system?   

&gt; These are just a handful of examples, the world is becoming a more prosperous place and most of the worlds successful nations are market economies. I know one doesn't necessarily imply the other, but I don't understand how capitalism is failing. Public opinion among millennials is one thing, but cherry picking small parts doesn't override the vast gains we've made as a civilization. That's why I consider it a small blip.

Yes, but where is the wealth going? Why do like 10-20 people have more wealth than 50% of the world? How is this a good thing? How is this useful? You may call these cherry picked small parts, but I can and probably will go on to expand the same reasoning to many more industries.
I cant tell if you're memeing or if you know that this isn't the subreddit for Destiny the game , but Destiny the streamer I just realized that if our accurate description of the universe requires every single physical quantity to be accounted for, actually entropy is a meaningless concept. Entropy is an emerging property of a system in a statistical description. Therefore the number that describes the universe actually doesn't increase in each time step, but remains constant, except when more particles are created or something like that.

Here is a little universe simulation to illustrate:

[After this sentence the number 2 is written, which will increase by one in the next time step as well as any number in this sentence. 2]

This mini-universe contains a complete description of itself (the sentence is a non-reduced description of itself) and a complete description of it's own time-evolution.You right, sorry I haven't had my BRAIN FORCE ALPHA today Aaaaah,

a shit-showNative americans didnt build the country. The most they built was a boat and a couple of huts. And they were all fighting each other, it wasnt like one big tribe who owned the whole thing and built infastructure. They were literally paleolithic. No one wanted to live here until white people built a white civilization. Yea they had the land, but we BUILT EVERYTHING you moron. I dont mind having minorities here. I do have a problem with being replaced. The country will go permanently blue, and white people will have less and less people to be able to associate with. We can let them be a part of our group, but they dont let us be a part of theirs. Thats a reality. Go to a hispanic area and try to make friends as a white guy lol. You would be lucky if you could even communicate with them. And we have to pay for all their government assistance and childrens education. Youre an idiot. This country WAS a white country. Just because it had minorities doesnt mean we have to give the country to the mexicans. &gt; Look at Cuba, Iran, North Korea, China, and Venezuela

Hello, CIA here we have never attempted to undermine any of these countries and their economy in the least bit.no  
The world needs to know&gt; I never claimed it to be.

These are your words my dude 

&gt; I also think that capitalism is the best economic system to progress society forward. Most of our innovation comes from the private sector seeking profit which has resulted in the improvement of our lives.

What else could this imply? Why bring it up if it isn't unique to capitalism? Why bring up a claim that you up unto this point have yet to provide any source other than "I think ..."? 

&gt; Can you prove that?

I mean I at least gave you an example of the iPhone. Can you show me companies that have done great innovations with $0 public funds or assistance? 

&gt; Maybe Uber/AirBnB need regulations of their own and they probably will have some coming. 

Considering both of them are literally just copies of the Taxi/Hotel industry I suggest that they follow those regulations. Which would mean neither company would ever be able to exist in their current form. I don't see why you keep trying to hold these companies up as examples of anything other than illegal companies who can only exist while dodging regulations. 

&gt; Why does every choice a person makes have to be good for them? It's obvious people prefer convenience.

That would be due to the fact that capitalism as a system will continue to cater to those desires to a point where it will begin to kill the consumer?

&gt; I never said we've reached utopia. 

Cool. [Over half of the world (3 billion) live on less than $2.50 a day where 80% live under $10 a day](http://www.globalissues.org/article/26/poverty-facts-and-stats). Glad we poverty is going down. Also is there a chance that we have redefined poverty? 

&gt; Things are always getting better in our capitalist society. You're also getting dangerously close to commie memes with that whole exploitation of labor bit.

I mean how else would you describe the labor force for the clothing industry? I mean do you think the FoxConn factories in China are? You don't need to push any specific agenda to see that a large portion of the labor force is being openly exploited. 

&gt; Why change something that's been working?

This is an insanely reductionist view point and that you actually made the statement is a clear indictment of your understanding of how companies work.

&gt; We've used an incentive system and specialization of skills to create a robust economy all while protecting personal freedoms, what is your alternative?

This seems to show that you have not only missed the point of the post but also seem to not understand that the current system is actually reducing personal freedoms. I also didn't provide an alternative on purpose. I mean if I had an alternative that I could present as objectively better I am pretty sure I wouldn't be posting on reddit...

&gt; Bernie memes.

How is a statement of fact a "Bernie meme". This is an objectively bad thing for the world and for the system of capitalism. If you are going to dismiss that as a meme what kind of conversation are you even looking for?do average IQ nextI'm not very active on this subreddit so I haven't seen a lot of these types of posts I more meant I'm sick of Tonka perpetuating this narritive everytime Destiny and him are on the same stream.You couldn't find a group of dumber people if you tried. The fact that Boreski and Tonka trucks are so outraged at Desity for the swimsuit bullshit and yet don't  care at all about JF'S rape of a mentally retarded person shows they have absolutely no moral reasoning skill whatsoever. For them, it's just a way to feign outrage and call Desity a pedo or whatever, it's got absolutely nothing to do with actual harm done.

Also, who is this TJ that styxx is talking about?That is assuming every number would have the same amount of entropy.

If you are going to just count through every number, I don't know a more efficient way to represent the state of your universe than just adding more and more bits for larger numbers.

In computer science, more needed bits is more entropy.

It's possible to encode numbers more efficiently, but that would involve skipping numbers.

So, the longer you ran this universe, the more bits it would require to represent the state. This basically would mean as I understand it would work in a similar way to our universe, because the amount of information in the universe would be increasing.

What would remain very small, or constant, would be the Kolmogorov complexity of the universe. However, it's possible the Kolmogorov complexity of our universe is also constant, and as far as I know it could be exactly the same as the universe you just suggested.

Maybe once you get numbers that require as many bits as our universe does, something inside the number theory involved starts to look like physics.Oh, so do you know what happened between TJ, styxx and destiny?&gt;In fact, it was a black man that got the patent for traffic lights, how many traffic lights do you see in your everyday life? A black guy did that.

"A black guy invented a thing therefore you have to let Mexicans mass migrate into your country" LMFAO. 

Dude you know we are being demographically replaced, dont be retarded. going from 85% white to 56% white in 50 years is demographic replacement

minorities vote blue because they know democrats will give them shit. It doesnt matter if GOP wasnt offensive, they know dems give them gibs, minority buisness loans, government assistance. Also Libertarian ism is a White ideology. hispanics are very pro big government (like 72% or something) while actual Americans are only something like 50%. Also all you have to do is tell minorites that whites and conservatives are racist and they'll vote democrat.

before civil rights blacks also had fathers, things change. Dems put them on wellfare and now theyre basically children that need democrats to take money from white people for them

Asians dont feel entitled to the land. Asians actually assimulate. Hispanics dont assimulate as much because they flooded over here so fast they dont even need to know english to get by. Asians arent coming over in as big of numbers and they actually respect our society and dont break laws. They also dont abandon their kids.

LOL. so you think a foreigner who just came over the boarder, either legally or illegally, is entitled to my earnings, on top of the infastructure that was built off the earning ive contributed my hole life? White people are on the least amount of government assistance per capita besides asians. Asians also dont abuse the emergency room system like hispanics. We all have to pay their bills when they dont pay their ER bills.

We took the land from the native americans, but it wasnt a country. It was a bunch of paleolithic tribes fighting each other on a large continent. We took it from them and built one of the best countries imn the world. If it was still the native americans who owned the continent, hispanics probably wouldnt even come here, because they wouldnt have a pre-made society to take advantage of.

&gt;and your immediate children can go and marry Muhammed and Tyrone and you can't do shit about it

Almost everyone marries within their own race. Naturally. And studies have shown whites + whites and white+ asians are WAAAY more likely to have happy long term relationships than whites+anyone else. Replacing whites with hispanics causes my child to have less options assuming theyre not a race-mixing outlier.

LOL THE LAND DOESNT GIVE A FUCK WHO LIVES ON IT?
Thats some hardcore strategic Nhilism. Lets just give the western world to those who will probably destroy it. After all, the land doesnt care does it? Lets increase the racial tension, replace white people into extinction, and laugh when they die. The land doesnt care.



The main point is, where are the surprises in this mini-universe? It is growing in size that's true, but every step is not only determined, it is also clearly described within the universe itself. It contains a description of itself and of it's future. Could the '2' read the sentence, it would know the future.


Although it doesn't really matter here, I would like to repeat that entropy is only defined in a statistical description, where we don't care about the details of every atom. Here we have decided against any statistics, so we really shouldn't care about entropy at all.Fair enough. 

Just curious, why don't you follow TJ anymore?As i've stated and as far as the public knows the dossier is still unverified and contains salacious material. As for McCabe ordering changes on 302 forms, i'll be honest and say i haven't heard anything about this and it seems hard to find reliable info online about it. Do you have any good sources describing the alleged wrong doing here? What was changed in the 302 forms? Also here is a link for others about what a 302 is. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FBI_forms#FD-302 ) It sounds like there has been a standing criticism about how the FBI uses its 302 forms.Nunes and others were briefed by Trey Gowdy, the person who read the FISA applications, about its contents. Trey Gowdy also disputes Nunes's memo or at least its claims about the credibility of the Muller probe.I've been coming to prety much the same conclusion recently. He's a straight up mythic (in other words, a crackpot). For example, listen to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlSsDsBCwQs

But he's well cited in his field so apparently he is a very good scientist, in fact he's even better cited than Gariepy.
Yep. He seems to have lost all his passion and he fell into this faux centrist, both sides are equally bad, but I'm only going to attack retarded feminists on twitter and buzzfeed while rarely ever criticizing the right or Trump  thing. Wow, I can't believe he brought up Destiny's son and then made a a joke about him suckling his dick. What an absolute piece of shit he is. Of fucking course. They need to convince themselves that destiny is a pedo and JF is a morally rightous, upstanding citizen. I will prob do this or healthcare next. 

I work in food logistics and all I can say is...woof the system really could use a lot of reform. On top of that there are large issue when it comes to how farming, transportation, grocery stores and how food is designed through consumer demand. 

All I will say now is that there are a lot of different companies that all touch your food multiple times before you take it off the shelf. Not all of them are very nice. Yep thats a long postNumbers have lots of surprises.

Sooner or later, somebody will discover a new record breaking prime, and lots of people will be surprised.

Super-composite numbers, false primes, cryptographically hard prime (factors) vs cryptographically easy prime (factors). When the universe gets to a new number that are many properties that number might or might not have that are surprising, that could not have been easily predicted just by looking at the previous numbers.

It's interesting you say "could the 2 read the sentence', because it's pretty much exactly wrong as I see it.

One, the "2" has no way to read the sentence. The two is only two bits, and probably cannot do anything. Even if some series of numbers had sufficient complexity to do anything, which I am postulating might be possible, any possible agent that would be performing anything would only be performing those actions inside the numbers, and would only be perceiving the features of the number that it exists in.

Those complexities inside the number have no way to read or perceive the other text in your universe.

You have said that entropy is only defined in a statistical description twice now, but it's not correct. Information entropy is basically just a measure of information content and is usually measured in bits.

For example, the Shannon entropy of a fair coin flip is higher (1) than the Shannon entropy of a weighted coin (less than 1), because a sequence generated by a weighted coin will be more compressible than a sequence generated by a fair coin.

You can read about the relationship between information entropy and thermodynamic entropy.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)#Entropy_as_information_content

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_in_thermodynamics_and_information_theory has there been like an appeal process update that I missed Seriously, you gotta trust me on this one, entropy is only defined in a probabilistic context. You can't put an entropy on something without comparing it to an ensemble of states it 'could' be in.

Even both articles you have send me to show me I'm wrong explain this in several places.

I'm not trying to be condescending here, but do you know what entropy is? I'm almost certain you don't.


And I can easily fix my mini-universe. I make the rulese there.

[After this sentence the number 2 is written, which will increase by one in the next time step as well as any number in this sentence and the number after this sentence is consciously aware of this sentence and of all mathematical implication of all numbers. 2]

And the point of the exercise was, that I can from the top of my head create a mini-universe which is reducible while containing a description of its entirety and its evolution.In information theory, entropy and information are the same, and entropy is measured in bits.

What is the relationship between probability and needed bits?

Say you have an random data source, for example a coin flip. Say you want to record completely the sequence of coin flips.

If your coin always lands on heads, you don't need to record anything. The data source has 0 entropy.

If the coin is completely fair, you will need a bit of entropy for each flip.

So I have defined entropy as "needed bits" in a probabilistic context.

So, just counting integers needs another bit every power of 2.
A completely random source of data will add n bits of entropy every n steps of the source. Counting integers will add log(n) bits of entropy every n steps of the source.

A completely biased coin, like you perhaps, will add 0 bits of entropy every n steps of the source.

Therefore, counting integers has decided less entropy than a completely random source, as we might expect, but it is also not 0, which might be a surprise to people that don't know any number theory, and feel like they are in a position to be condescending.

One way to understand this might be the fact that there are "probablistic" events in a sense in integers, like the distribution of primes and other properties.

entropy of primes reference: http://www.math-math.com/2016/10/prime-distribution-and-shannon-entropy.html

edit: I do have a degree in computer science by the way. I'm not saying i'm going to be 100% the ultimate authority about everything, but I'm not just making this shit up.

I'm also not intimidated by physicists. My dad was a physicist, and I thought I was going to be one too, until I saw how physicists conducted themselves in online discussions like this one. I'm not even kidding. Like my dad would teach me physics when I was a kid, and it was all about fun and wonder, but then I started reading forums to learn more on my own and with you guys it's all ego and flame. Where is the joy in learning? The sense of wonder? The beauty of nature? The discipline does not seem to be what he advertised.

I went into philosophy instead, and eventually computer science. I'm thinking maybe I will go to grad school in math now. Certainly not physics.I usually find Sam Seder's content pretty tedious because of his belaboured attitude and his appeal to emotion. This is probably the most enjoyable video I have seen from himWould love to see this. Unfortunately, I will have to bow out for a while because Automata has piqued my curiosity about Nier/Drakengard and I want to experience Taro's vision for myselfDo you have any sources for the claim that rich suburbanites are more likely to be addicted to drugs and commit suicide or acts of terror than poor people in the inner city? I suppose we are disagreeing because it seems like you are not considering the necessity of representing the number the your universe in a decode-able way.

A number, must represented distinctly from previous possible numbers, or as you put it "an ensemble of states it 'could' be in".

I think it makes more sense to say, a number must be represented distinctly from the ensemble of states it could have been.

So, to see where entropy comes in, you need to imagine the universe as a message, being transmitted and received. The receiver is attempting to decode the message, and there are many possible messages that could be decoded.

The state of your universe is just one such possibility, and therefore representing the number in a way that can be decoded requires it be be compared to other possible messages that could have been decoded. In than sense every number is simply one of many possibilities.

If a number cannot be decoded, or distinguished from other possible numbers, is it still a number? You seem to be saying it is, and I seem to be saying it is not.

One thing that I think is interesting is that the representation and decoding of numbers is fundamentally connected to the probabilities of getting prime numbers. However, I might not be doing anyone any favors but jumbling the two pieces of the puzzle together.

I'm honestly sorry I was flaming you a bit myself there, but I think figuring out this sort of stuff is fun and I prefer to do it without ego involved, and I felt like I was just fighting back.

Currently, the best we can do for encoding numbers is base log2(n) bits per number. I think nature has a lower bound of natural log(n) bits per number, and that I think is directly related to randomness in the distribution of primes.

Primes are not completely random, but they are sort of random. As our understanding of the distribution of primes improves it might be possible to encode numbers in natural log (n) bits instead of log2(n) bits.

If prime numbers were not somewhat randomly distributed, it would be possible to write a formula to predict which numbers will be prime, and in that case I don't think encoding numbers would require any entropy. This would also probably break many other things.

Basically, the only way you can avoid being surprised by the numbers you count, is if you don't care about representing them and you don't care if they are prime. If you don't care about those two things then I don't think it's really a number, and you are not really counting.

Also, I really don't understand what you are doing with the word part in the universe, I think the operative part is just the increasing number, and the properties would effectively be the same as this universe:

universe = 0;
while(true){
universe++;
}

Well, that is fine. I'm not here because I've become a Democrat or even remotely want to be.

I'm satisfied with Trump's performance, and him keeping his promises. If some people dont think he deserves, or want to give him credit for, any of that, well I'm not here to tell you otherwise.

As I said,I dont like the alt-right's social or racial views, nor the enablers that hide behind their fake skeptic brand, and I appreciate Destiny being one of the few voices that isnt afraid to expose these people. Just like the SJWs, neither of these extremes do a thing for the broad swath on both sides other than sow chaos.Daughter is not as ugly as I’d have imagined someone who’d fuck their father to be.So?

Maybe if you want to be curious, and dig through people's comments, you can take a cue from Destiny and try asking about posts for some context.
Why is that a problem?


1) I don't think Obama is a huge fan of the U.S. as it is seen by the political left, and sees it as an "imperialistic power" that wanted to take it down a peg. I think the Democrats as a party really have a cringe-worthy habit of never missing a chance of needlessly taking potshots at national symbols and traditions. I dont miss him, and the AskReddit question inquired

2) That is what most wars were for. To protect women and children, and to keep harm away from them, and to secure resources so that society could have the stability so that the next generation can grow in stability. Hillary said that women were always the primary victims of war. This is not true since men have been required to fight and die in them, and it is men that have to do most of the fighting. It is extremely disrespectful to have worded that the way she did.

&gt;what makes you think trump could grow a mustache?

 Because most men post-puberty can?
I watch portions of them. I see his points. I mean, he at least tries to be succinct unlike others. And in a debate, it is up to the other guy to at least do a better job at presenting his side. 

But in the end he is entitled to not like the guy. 

I do admit I haven't got to most of those videos that deal with this topic alone yet.Well he's done away with the individual mandate part. That is an extraction I can live with now. I've hated that part the most.Maybe Democrats "as a party" was an exaggeration on my part. More a general culture among the more extreme left-wing elements was more appropriate to say.so, by admitting that they put “allegedly” in front of every false statement to “cover their asses”, is this the definition of slander? why would they have to “cover their asses” if they were telling the truth? OMG Warski is the worst of the worst. I was shoveling snow listening to that video today seriously thinking "who the fuck do you think you are fooling, Warski?".

He's up there with Roaming Millennial when it comes to being a grinning idiot, and playing patty cake with the alt-right, while thinking saying "well I don't agree with them" is a substitution for actually TRYING when you are on stream #4,342 with them.

They showed more outrage at some 17 year old transgender or  bedroom feminist activist, than some clown that straight-up advocates for removing non-whites from the U.S. because they cant deal with them being in the same zip code!You dont need to be rude.Well you can think that if you want, but it still is a rude comment.Well that is an immature. Sorry.No.

I just think if you dont want to like him for whatever reason, then that is cool.Basically was gonna say this - tbh of all the leftist circlejerks Destiny has had in the past (Kristi Winters, Contra, David Pakman) this one might be the least interesting? Because in the others it felt like both people were bringing up their own stuff whereas I sorta got the sense in this video that Destiny was just saying things and Theryn was just agreeing

But who knows, maybe I've just seen too many of the "conversations with a leftist" videos back to back latelyI mean is this a shock? He's friends with Ethan who's had JP on twice now, I would be willing to bet Pewdiepie is the one that hooked them up.&gt; Trump supporter? Kill yourself.

No. But thanks for asking.On it?

It's pure nonsense.

Dude I'm so glad you finished this one. WORTHHe got so red when he was streaming until after 6am. I've never seen that complexion on him.Armored Skeptic and Shoeonhead look pretty weird here.I've been waiting for this thread!

Several years ago (about 10 lol) a guy i played starcraft with showed me destinys memey starcraft videos (ratz stay rats, baneling rape, etc.) and I thought "Oh this guy is funny because he's an asshole!"

One day, I decided that my regular starcraft streamers weren't as entertaining anymore so I thought I would tune into destinys stream for some funny commentary along with my usual fare of high level starcraft gameplay. Well imagine my shock when i see Steven playing the fucking piano and talking about music WITH A PASSION. I subbed on the spot. I was a sub for about 5 years. I watched him play csgo and league and follow the hype of random new releases like dayz, RUST, and PUBG. I've learned a lot from his political debates and gained a healthy respect of him from his realtalks and stories. 

I'm a fan of Destiny because of who he is as a person. My life has changed a lot over the last 7 years, but the one constant has been Destiny's stream. Out of all the celebrities and entertainers I admire, Destiny is the only one I actually look forward to meeting one day, because I know I won't be disappointed by the man if and when I see him in person. 

P.S. Steven if you read this, let me be clear that I'm no pitying you, you fuck boy. My life has sucked too lol. Just know that I know that you are a loving father, loyal friend, and dedicated leader of this fucked up community you have built, regardless of what the alt-cuck snowflakes say. I have the utmost respect for you, whether you want it or not. Get fucked. Delet thisAll Race Realism is is a renaming of the Neo Conservatives belief in Social Darwinism which was debunked in the 1930's, the problem with the Alt Right is were told there new but there not there just the same ignorant collection of goofs who made up the tea party. There existence as of today is merely due to Trump and once he's gone they will disappear in to the Ether again like they did under Obama.Actually knowing Peterson's position? Get downvoted. Don't stand in the way of blind hate!Use Twitch clips, not streamable. Thanks.HA is another debate going to happen ? Illinois Nazisthat's been the game for the word go and with that you can paint the whole left http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052300/reviews take note of the pure cringe of Tonka a 1950's Walt Disney movie how edgy https://johnsontranscript.com/2013/08/17/robi-vio-interview/ he is a wrestler but not Chris Chavis and he's not black and his only connection to native American is a 1958 Disney movie called Tonka, really he's a sad pathetic skinny guy who larped as a wrestler just look at his Matches on YouTube there terrible.Tonka is just salty because he's terrified that people see him for the skinny balding lonely guy he is, it's funny he says vamp is his girlfriend the fact she lives in Kansas and he lives in the southern states just shows what a bizarre fantasist he is that and his obsession with people's sex lives and appearance speaks more of his own short comings. This isn't a dox I was offered that by his real enemies and refused it in the comments of the cuntstream. The sad reality is now he has an open door policy to the Alt Right he's now on the radar of the Southern Poverty Law Centre http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/welcome-to-youtube-bloodsports-the-alt-rights-newest-recruiting-tool/I can't find anything in the rules that doesn't let you create a new account after your original one gets suspended. quality postHe did nothing wrong and he or every other celebrity should have gotten away with itOh. Good job then. :)Oh it's ok. I know that a lot of it is just the shit-talking of gaming culture coming through, so I don't take the calls for me to kill myself seriously. :)

And yeah, I'm guilty of the absolutist talk. Saying that Obama hates America is a bit of that. That's something I agree that I need to work on if I am not going to like when people on the left use the same language.Govern like Hillary would have or actually advocate for something like an "ethnostate".It's all good. I wont try to move people off of any heartfelt political positions. I get that this is really the place for them, and wont make a scene. :)loouve you eediuhhtWatched some of his 2016 election stuff on Twitch (when he watched the debates etc) and heard a few of his debates with random twitter people which I liked but I wasn't a Twitch guy so I didn't really follow too closely at first. What made me a fan was watching the "pol girl" debate on YouTube and then subscribing to the YouTube channel

Soon after that I discovered ContraPoints through him, Shaun and Jen through her, and Hbomberguy afterwards.Well right now I'm sticking with :

My #1 criteria is that you cannot be chummy with the alt-right in any way. Conservative, but none of that other shit. holy shit you just snark at everything you have no argument about or are too much of a cuck with no values to care about. Man its funny how dumb you obviously are because you have to say shit like "The land doesnt care who lives on it" when an entire group of people is being displace. Actually, if would bet the land would rather have whites and asians live on it since everyone else trashed the environment.

Yea asians are smarter than us, does that mean we are not allowed to have our own countries? Does that mean all homogeneous countries must diversify? Or let me guess, thats only white peoples burden?

Look at the stupid shit you said. You're in highschool right?isnt this ban evasionElliot Rodger existed before the alt-right did though...Brexit wasn't about the British economyJesus Christ you're dumb. Just another non white feeling entitled to the country we built. Pathetic.Lol.out of a.couple.million, less than a thousand are in the military? Good argument Paco, it's not like the military isn't almost entirely white Christan me bahahahaha.  Oh no, we would send an already migratory people back home, let's forget about the people who have been here for generations having to move because of the infkix of 3rd worlders moving in and making it little Mexico. 
It's not displacing IF THEYRE MIHRATORY AND IT WASNT THEIRS TO BEGIN WITH

motherfucker Ive had to work with these people, and it sucks trying to talk to them when they don't speak English, having them hate you for not being one of them. You probably never even had a real job little bitch.


The country was built by whites, for whites. It's why it was 90% white at one point, we had only white immigration, and only white could vote.  It was over 85% white until only 50 years ago. Your sense of entitlement to this country is false.

It's fucking funny how you shitskins think the white people who built this country should just give it over to Mexico, and if we have a problem with that we need to move to Europe. The sense of entitlement is unrealMaybe talk to him a bit about the deplatforming people? I know he'll probably lean towards not doing that but his friends think otherwise.Can someone link the VOD-timestamp to MrMouton being mad?F for Jim.Hi, I would like to apologise that I was a little aggressive and ignorant before and giving physicists a bad name.

Actually I had a really stressfull exam ahead (which I passed now), so becoming a physicist actually kind of directly made me a dick.

I dismissed your expertise because it was so alien to me and I was arrogant, so please accept my humble apology.

See what is so strange about this is to me - who doesn't know number theory - a number is arbitrary to me.

Maybe because in Physics, we shift numbers around all the time.

For example if I understand the increasing number as 'a pointer moving in a homogenous one-dimensional space', it seems arbitrary to me if I call the position 1 or 12.

I could even flip the coordinate system around and start at -900.

Now the entropy you defined would be decreasing, although it represents the same process.

Is it possible that there are different kinds of numbers or types of information?

Like, I would understand if I'm actually counting something, let's say apples. That 13 indistinguishable apples have more entropy in a sense, because you could, like, do more stuff with them than one apple. Does that make sense?

But if I'm not counting distinct 'things' but keep track of something arbitrary like position in a homogenous space, is there maybe some fundamentally slightly different definition at work?

I'm just speculating here, because it's puzzling meAsk him why 90% of skeptics are afraid to show their faces.Nothing is black and white, im sure there is a portion of people who watch Destiny that like Peterson. Hell in terms of his psychology i'm sure Jordan Peterson and Destiny would probably agree on a lot of points. Its just whenever Peterson ventures outside his field is when you start to wonder how credible he is. All this bs of cultural marxism, which he calls postmodernism, and the whole idea of feminism wanting to be dominated by Islam is where you really start scratching your head. Personally I like the phrase "Ben Carson syndrome" to describe academics like Peterson.It's not just your fault. It's an interdisciplinary kind of question, and a more rigorous use of "entropy" would have probably made communication easier.

As for the negative number case, all that is required is that the integers and natural numbers must be equally countable.

For something to be countable, it must be possible to project it onto the natural numbers, and to do that you just need to alternate between positive and negative numbers.

However, if that log(n) is makes sense it needs to be a log of the natural number. To be more specific it is upper bound is less than log(|n| * c), and the value exactly would be something like log(|n| * 2 + (n/|n|) + 1).

So more precisely the bits of -900 would be something like log2(1800).

It's common to simply omit that constant but in this case leaving it in would have made it clear that you want to take the log of the natural number that designates the integer, not the integer itself.

Something that is interesting is that all rational numbers are actually countable as well. In binary that would require more than log(n * c) bits. I think it might be something like log(n^2) but it depends how you order the fractions. In that case you have added another dimension that you need to encode, where negative numbers are on the same dimension, so it's just off by a constant there.

This basically speaks to your final point because positions in homogeneous space cannot be completely encoded, only estimated. If you take two vectors with the same direction but truly random magnitudes in continuous space, the chance they will have a rational relationship to each other is 0.

The amount of irrational relationships is a different order infinity, so if you compare your countably infinite chances at getting a rational number to the uncountably infinite chances you won't, you end up with no chance to get a rational number.

The only thing you can do is approximate, or define one vector as having have a rational relationship to another.

I think it might be controversial, or even wrong, for me to say something like a position in homogeneous space is not a number, but I am used to numbers that have discrete guts that are not approximations.

Many irrational numbers that people use at least have precise formulas, so I suspect that there would probably be some way of counting formulas. This would mean a position in homogeneous space would have 0 chance of being a "nice" irrational number with a formula as well. I'm speculating a bit there. Algebraic number?

I would say something like that is a "value" or "scalar" I think. They are are ultimately synonyms, but to me it seems like number has a discrete connotation.

It's difficult to say what it really is.

What is interesting is this sort of gets back to the topic of what entropy is.

I've been thinking about it, and I think the error I made was not carefully enough grouping together entropy and information, and defining the difference.

Entropy might be a good way to refer to information that you don't know, or could not have observed, and perhaps there is another term I am missing here to describe information that you do know, or could have observed.

So, for example inside our universe there is lots of entropy because there is lots we don't know. Lots of details of things we cannot record. It's possible from some perspective outside our universe all that would change from unknown entropy to known information. The amount of entropy would then change depending on where you are observing from.

The main thing I've been struggling to understand, is how is it possible that discreet deterministic patterns like [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30) have low and constant entropy, and can be said by definition to have low and constant entropy, when it seems clear that something that looks like entropy is increasing.

I think it might be the case that from our perspective outside looking in, there truly is no growth of entropy, but that is only a claim about our perspective. Inside the system itself, there is, because it is a different perspective. If you try to take the "number eye view" instead of looking in from the outside, it might make sense to say there is entropy.

edit: Congratulations on the exam by the way!

edit2: And, of course I still forgot to put some symbol for absolute value so the thing with the negative integers still makes no sense.[3cute5me](https://i.imgur.com/fYOUlXM.jpg)No Bullshit is such a petulant child. He's one of the few people that actually makes me angry when I hear his dumbass voice try to formulate sentences.A hammer should workWhat I know so far:  
-Was definitely born in Germanyyoure so retarded/ "muh native americans". Yea because they built this country and we should do to whites what whites did to natives 400 years ago. And youre a fucking virgin if you havent noticed asian women dating white men like crazy. I wouldnt want to deport those who serve. But because a couple hundred serve, you think that justifies keeping millions? And im not racist. I dont hate hispanics. I hate being replaced. I have nothing against individuals, I just dont want to live in mexico. Yea I say racial epithets, because I dont care, but im actually not racist. I just want us to stop being invaded by unassimilated foreigners until our communities are unrecognizable.


You think im low IQ when your only arguments are "muh native americans" and "Some of them are in the new welfare system called the U.S army"


besides that all you do is call me dumb and racist, which is not an argument. Youre not nearly as smart as you think you are. I personally am doing just fine. I make bank as a trademan, I just hate not being able to communicate with my countrymen. I bet you dont even have  a job. To honestly justify replacing an entire group people in modern times (not 400 years ago) because you dont like them is riduculous. We dont want genocide. We just dont want to be replaced. YOU people actually want to genocide white people. "We'll take all your countries because you can just move to russia, give us the rest of the west". lol youre a fucking moron dude. And I have a study that says intelligent people actually tend to be intelligent, These studies are usually bullshit and the thing you lefties is you dont understand what average even means. Its why you buy bullshit like the wage gap lie. youre dumb kid.


And  by the way, I dont mind them working here. I do mind them voting democrat just because they dont know better, and abusing our education and Emergency room systemsBased on his assessment on top lane, he is 99% hashinshin long lost gay brother. Quote me on this when you guys figure it out.I gave you a million arguments. But all I need is "I dont want to be replaced, fuck you". All you say is "muh native americans 400 years ago".

Just watch this if you are willing to open your mind. He address most of the dumb arguments you people come up with to justify forcing foreigners on us. I bet you dont even have to interact with them except to buy food. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Ue0rmGiI0I can't wait till we see some of the "skeptics" unironically think this is serious.Don't Norway and Switzerland pretty much have most of what the UK wants?It's literally an interview show my dude. It's not a debate or a discussion. He doesnt bring people on to challenge them or their ideas, he brings them on to interview them about things he(Bunty) wants to hear about.  
The people he invites on, come onto the show knowing it's an interview show and probably wouldnt come on otherwise. If you want someone to challenge their ideas, then just dont watch Bunty.I guess we just have different values of free speech.  
If I want a debate, I go to someone who does debates/discussions on topics.  
If I want to hear about who a person is or what they have to say about a situation, I go to an interview show, but I guess that's just me.  
I actually took the time and watched the interview, there was no intentional malice or lies being told, the dude even admitted that he understood why he was fired and that he brought it on himself.  
  
Do you think that whenever people put out any content with anything you might disagree with, it should be a 2 hour debate about how their thoughts are absolutely terrible and they should be disgusted?  There is only one solution: Cringe-swipe ugly cunts on tinder until you get some pussyPerhaps we should put the guy on Channel 4 news instead then?  
And ofc you arent obligated to platform anyone, that's not the point at all. The reverse is true however, that if you market yourself as an interview show that just displays the interviewees point of view, you should be able to interview whoever you want.  
The difference between Bunty and Andy, is that Andy markets it as a "debate", but only shows one side and never challenges, that's disingenuous. But Bunty has never claimed such and repeatedly states that it's not a debate.  
When you have the disclaimers and make your intentions clear, why should there be any issues? Should it be disallowed cause it's the wrong name in the hot seat? And if that is your belief, then I feel sorry for you. You just might be on to something good sir.Sure, and that's a totally valid criticism in this case. Usually Bunty is pretty good at leading the conversation and asking different questions, in this case he had two people on and he didnt say as much himself and therefor it might not have been as great a piece of content as it could have been. But that's pretty far off from going to Buntys channel and expecting a debate, then calling him a cuck and an idiot for doing what his format is.That's just the 'clipped' meme.

Sargon is obviously not racist in his principles or positions.

But all people are racist emotionally.Hosting a disproportionate amount of racists and problematic figures of the right?  
Take a look at his last 10 videos;  
3 has been with right-figures,  
5 has been with left-figures,  
and 2 have been fluff-pieces/funny videos.  
I'm sorry, I just dont see what you're seeing. Right now it feels like there's a disproportional amount of the politics/yt scene, which is right-leaning (or would be associated with those) and Bunty is even going out of his way to find newer leftie YT'ers (that I've never heard about) and signal boosting them on his channel, giving them new subs.  
I dont hear anyone talk about this? But as soon as he does a show with right-leaning people it's a shitstorm. I'm sorry but it's starting to feel more like a meme than anything.   
Has twenty years practice of clinical psychology.

Has been teaching psychology for 25 years.

Is being called out by a philosophy master for 'bad pop psychology'.

this world is too legitSure, you can go back and check his entire channel. The point with the "last 10 videos" was to show that he's changed recently.  

He said around new year that he would make a more conscious effort in 2018 to be more moderate in his views and platform people from "both sides". If you wanna take 2018, that just adds 1 more to right and 1 more to left, which still leaves it as 4 vs 6.  
It's obvious that the nuance is lost and the meme prevails by the downvotes, people hardly change their minds once they're made up, even on this subreddit unfortunatly. &gt;Or the fact that the party completely denies climate change beeing a thing, the only german party to do so.

Here is a [link](https://www.afd.de/wp-content/uploads/sites/111/2017/06/2017-06-01_AfD-Bundestagswahlprogramm_Onlinefassung.pdf) to the official "Wahlprogramm"(election programm?) of the AFD in german. Under point 13.1 on page 65 is the hillariously shit statement on climate change. I link this here because every single time I bring up their refusal to acknowledge climate change some uninformed retard claims this to be "fake news".

Also worth noting on page 19:(loosely translated)  
"For permanent peace in europe a relaxed connection to russia is required. It is in the interest of germany to include russia in the structure of our security policy without forgetting our own interests and those of our allies. The AFD stands for an end to sanctions against russia. Economic cooperation between russia and germany needs to deepen."

The AFD is literally just another pawn in Putin's plan to destabilize the west and I cannot fathom any decently intelligent person to even think about supporting them in any way shape or form.I mean, the last of us playthrough got uploaded.....@and156 I am more curious to hear what made you stop gaming. I always admire people who just enjoy one game wholeheartedly and then don't feel the need to play something else. Although I am just assuming this is your case.

I had no idea Destiny even existed until the JonTron thing. I was already into gaming, just starting to open up to Twitch, and hated Sargon and Thunderf00t(although reformed) and the whole anti-sjw movement. A match made in heavenBunty we know you love us, hell you're probably part of our sub reddit community. If things are getting that bad here why not just set up a conversation with Destiny and talk about fan toxicity?I agree, don't consider Thunderf00t apart of that community anymore. Although if you did, probably yes and I'd maybe add in Logicked and DarkMatter2525Bunty is a snowflake, he actually cares to browse this subreddit and see who's talking about him and then gets triggered by what he reads. It's bad!

But I'm not yet pessimistic about it. I feel like probably people have always been that way and now the information of the internet allows us to bring it into the open and call it out. I try to see it as the last powerful lashing out of a dying beast.My friend showed me his political debates and ended up being overly invested in the community and give him money that he doesn't need from time to time. Dafellas Tell me about it! It's a grind out of hell.

J.P. fans call me a cultist, when I agree with Sam Harris

Destiny fans call me a Nazi when I agree with J.P.

Sargon fans call me a cuck when I agree with Destiny

And it goes on and on and on.

But stay with me, I feel we are the future.And those kids living in a shanty town will soon have to compete with robots for jobs.Affordable in what country and how?Found his stream with like 200+ people on liquidpedia about a month or so after WoL came outI absolutely agree with you. Let's be clear on something: I'm completely opposed to automation because it's a direct assault against the worker and a scheme designed to enrich the rich with impunity. Normally technology is supposed to be a tool to make work easier, and usually creates jobs, but the digital world has killed off the postman and is killing photography and film. I'm saying that automation itself poses a serious threat to everyone who isn't in the 1%. Automation must be battled aggressively at every level. In the first world you have employees working off food stamps in warehouses without air conditioning. Honestly automation is poor investment. You earn $100B in a monopoly that's outta control, yet will not re-invest it in its own workers. That's poor investment.A world full of unemployed people forced to live off of uncompetitive, fixed wages as the wealthy get wealthier.

Be wary of the concept of Universal Basic Income, where people are given a fixed income from the government or private interest or whatever. Unlikely to happen because we all know that no wealthy person or corporation would want to pay someone who isn't working, and have always opposed any taxation, any restriction, against their quest for enormous wealth, so you can forget UBI ever being implemented.Preferably a democratic socialist society. Government isn't always infallible and must represent the will of the people as long as individual rights aren't violated. I'd prefer throngs of workers committed to a single project over a few meagre robots. Machines are tools and should remain as tools, not as replacements.The USSR, as well as any other communist country, wasn't close to being democratic or even socialistic.I really do want to see some of his League rage hahaThank you my dude :)Lol interesting.You seem to be deliberately ignoring the huge mountain of evidence of autrocities committed by communist governments then and now.You're ignoring that Kruschev denounced Stalin shortly after the latter's death. Read *The Gulag Archipelago*. You seem to be forgetting that the Soviet Union and other communist states have collapsed and that China has evolved into a fascist state. Above all, the autrocities you've listed was caused by the existence and true nature of communism, including the rise of fascism and Nazism.

When has he ever provided anything besides jokes/banter to the stream?&gt; Sorry if I misrepresented anyone.

A true Des^^tiny would preface an argument with this, to protect yourself from accusations of gish galloping.This is some real OuO shit right here
At this point who the fuck honestly cares?

These morons have used an imaginary daughter as ammo, have claimed for over a month now that he is a pedophile and have come to the conclusion that sharing a publicly available wrestling name is doxing. Giving them more ammo is 100% irrelevant for their little fantasy world.Being uninformed, making unsubstantiated claims, providing 0 evidence and having a the_donald filled post history... SADOn stream there was the claim that Sam is proposing judaeo-christian values*edit*: another victory for The Idea Revolution

[another win for the marketplace of ideas]Aye, comradeWtf is this bullshit, we can bully bunty all we want but we need to play nice with Peterson's cult following defending every fucking retarded statement he makes? No one here ever attacks Peterson over his academic work since we're all focused around his philosophy that's intertwined with his personal beliefs and borders on conspiracy theory. Bunty being a soft interviewer is nothing compared to the fucking delusional shit Peterson pushes.Perhaps that last part explains everything?

&gt; Large audience

Has a service with large audience ever had consistent moderating? I'm triggered when you address a streaming service with male pronouns.Sargon is half-black, so he's got some legitimately to say it.It was obviously a joke, but "larger audience" refers to Twitch and not Destiny in the picture above.

&gt; that reaches a larger audience.

What reaches a larger audience? It's in the text:

&gt; You're still choosing to stream on ***a platform* that reaches a larger audience.**

You can obviously refer to Twitch in any way you want, but the pronouns meme usually triggers someone so I went with that one. 

If there are any other bets or lotteries that accepts submissions after the answer has been revealed please do let me know. I always double down on those.

&gt; Destiny won't reach a larger audience if he keeps playing league. That's why he used he.

You're not wrong btw. It's just irrelevant to the picture and my comment. You misunderstood either or both.

In case you are curious. Go back and read the comment chain.

* I comment on Twitch being a service with a large audience.

* OP replies to my comment, referring to Destiny's (not Twitch's) large audience.

* I realize he misunderstood my comment and made a joke on his terms (e.g that we're talking about Destiny's large audience in my comment chain)

* You called me stupid. The irony when you call people dumb. Let me explain to you once again:

* I commented on the picture, which is about Twitch's audience.

* He replied to me about something else: Destiny's audience.

* I realized that he misunderstood me ***and made a joke about it.***

I think you've wooshed yourself way past the point of no return here though. Is it too embarrassing to go back and read the comment chain again? Hint: It doesn't start at his comment; it starts with mine.

&gt; Dude, you're stupid as fuck.

I get that Destiny can be savage in his debates *[and streams in general]* when they turn into meme-fests and that it's the first thing that people start to mimic when watching him – but you really shouldn't start there. It will be embarrassing.*That's the joke.* I talked about Twitch and OP misunderstood something and started talking about "he," clearly referencing Destiny and not the topic –  Twitch – so I ran with it.

*The theory here is that the Twitch community attacks women by calling them boobie streamers and is now trying to exclude women altogether by calling Twitch by male pronouns.*

Do you see how this very obviously is a joke, especially in the context it's presented? I can think of at least one *boy* who fell for the joke. His dad is black.Ah, so his grandfather was black on his father's side.Maybe said to protect his family.Can I repeat "the irony" enough to you? You misunderstood a conversation and calls me an autistic idiot.

You obviously can't be autistic though. Chads can't be autistic, right? *Brah.*It's hard to argue that the joke didn't do exactly what I intended it to after this long conversation with you. I do realize that you, being the target of the joke, can't agree to that though.Yes. The target of sarcasm is the people who inevitably misses the sarcasm and engages with the statement on a surface level. In contrast, someone who is a part of the joke would have gotten the sarcasm and choose to continue the facade.&gt; people see your sarcasm

Clearly lmao

&gt; hey asshole, what does gender pronouns have anything to do with it?

Although you didn't get the sarcasm I have to admit you are being consistent with your opinion that I am stupid.She's a cunt who leaches off anyone who gives her attention and shit talks Mouton for no reason. She's the lowest tier girl.Yeah I think he is right too.

He is doing a pretty good job laying out the nuances that tend to get completely lost in this kind of situation.

It was basically the same situation with PewDiePie and the "satire" thing. You don't need to be actually racist to make content that does more harm than good.

Just pointing out that some content does more harm than good is enough to point out on it's own, independent of any judgement of character.

It's possible to make a judgement about a specific piece of content without making a judgement about the creator of that content.

I just wish these points would scroll by in some sort of news ticker for everyone involved any time this sort of discussion happens.1. genocide is not ONLY killing. Genocide can occur by simply displacing people with massive amounts of immigrants. according to the U.S government it does not require murder. YOURE the one who doesnt know what genocide means BAHAHA. "But muh latin". the unwarranted arrogance is hilarious.

2. There are a shit ton of jobs in the army that dont require you to risk your life. But just because a few of them are in the army, does not mean we must pay for all the fast food workers with 4 children and on every government assistance possible/

3. Dont pretend like you dont know what demographic displacement is.

4. You only dont care about the way they vote because overwhelmingly vote democrat for gibs and because "muh racism". I wouldnt care about them voting if they were close to 60/40. but they are turning entire states blue. California used to be a swing state until immigrants turned it permanently blue, and now we have law makers proposing we pay for illegal immigrants free healthcare. You would be pissed as fuck if republicans started mass migrating republican voting immigrants into the country, even if they were latin american/mexican. Youre such shitty person. Democrats are putting foreigners ahead of their own people, massively shifting the demographic and party power, and you have no problem with it because youre a bad person.

You are actually OK with replacing the country with third worlders just for easy votes. And even though you refuse to face reality, the truth is white people did build this country. "But the cpuntry was only 90% white, that means every mexican is entitled to citizenship!" White people are a global minority and are not required to give up their countries to entitled third worlders because of assholes like you.

Why do you think Japan and China dont take in massive amounts of immigrants?

Youre an unamerican, globalist faggot. Guess what, China will take your land, but they wont give up theirs, because theyre not pretentious idiots like you.

http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-pol-ca-california-voting-history/

Your appeal to athority fallacy is retarded, and guess what, we are lucky if we stay at the current stage of civilization. Youre autistic'
Did you just call me a pseudo-intellectual? That's a logical fallacy, y'know!destiny is a bigger faggot than JPmaybe white people stop having babies when they cant afford it, because theyre paying for all the mexican babies? Youre a fucking idiot, its actually sad.

they actually seemed to have changed their definition of genocide, probably so they dont have to admit they are doing it to whites.

White countries are socialist? Im not talking about Europe. 77% of mexicans are for big gov while only like 54% of natural americans are for big gov. You dont know what the fuck youre talking about. They come here because they are escaping communism. Even mexico has univeral healthcare (that doesnt work).

I have a wife, that doesnt stop the demographic shift. Youre really dumb. Im not reeing. A country doesnt just go from 85% white to 56 % white  in less than a generation without replacement. We cant afford to have kids, and then the government makes us pay for the mexicans children. Not hard to understand.

If you dont see that "astronomers agree with me politically" is appeal to authority fallacy, than there really is no hope for you.
You know youre wrong. its obvious.well, the race realist retards would be social darwinists.. so, no"Expose yourself to literature!"

\*Comments on the content of articles he never read\*I mean, in debate it is often good practice to call out your opponent when you think that they are using fallacious reasoning. Famous debaters do it for a reason - it's effective. If you can clearly point out a fault in an opponent's logic, and everyone can see it and put a name to it, you've basically won that argument. My problem is with the people who don't actually understand shit, but are constantly emulating their heroes and pointing out logical fallacies where there are none, or where the logical error is trivial enough that it's simply pedantic.Holy shit... Maybe I really am a pseudo-intellectual.I feel like you are using a feelings-based argument...There is one post on Resetera, where a guy claims that. He was called out by users on the site and later banned (although I'm not sure if he was banned in this thread).

Laughable how he is supposed to be representative of the left.

edit: I just checked. He doubled down on this nonsense and got his ass banned:

You didnt address any of my other arguments, and you would be FREAKING out if the immigrants werent changing the country in your favor. If they werent all voting democrat but instead republican. You people are the ones manipulating elections with outside influence.  Youre way too old to be this dumbMore like traditional Social Darwinism...It is very easy to find mexicans use a lot of government assistance. And even when they dont, they do not contribute enough to cover  the costs of all of their children's education. We also have to pay for more policing in their areas. THere is a whole host of problems with this but you wont even acknowledge demographic displacement so I wont even bother trying argue with you. You literally think open boarders is OK because we might live in space one day. And you really think youre not retarded.....


And because other countries are socialist, you think its ok to make our country do it too by manipulating democracy? You just proved my point that youre ok with flooding the country with them because you agree with them politically. Youre a bad person. If we flooded New Your with immigrants until it turned red you dumbasses would be freaking out in self righteous indignationHey humanist. Youre so fucking dumb you didnt even stop to think that we couldnt even save 0.0001% of the world's suffering without completely fucking our country up.

From wikipedia

"In FY 2010, African-American families comprised 31.9% of TANF families, white families comprised 31.8%, and 30.0% were Hispanic.[50] Since the implementation of TANF, the percentage of Hispanic families has increased, while the percentages of white and black families have decreased. In FY 1997, African-American families represented 37.3% of TANF recipient families, white families 34.5%, and Hispanic families 22.5%.[51] The population as a whole is composed of 63.7% whites, 16.3% Hispanic, 12.5% African-American, 4.8% Asian and 2.9% other races.[52] TANF programs at a cost of about $20.0 billion (2013) have decreased in use as Earned Income Tax Credits, Medicaid grants, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), child nutrition programs, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), housing assistance, Feeding Programs (WIC &amp; CSFP), along with about 70 more programs, have increased to over $700 billion more in 2013.[53]"

That would put hispanics using these programs at about 5 times the rate of whites per capita.

And you faggots always say these people make no money doing jobs no one wants to do. If thats the case, how the fuck would they be paying enough taxes to cover all of their children's education? All the fast food workers? It doesnt add up.

on average, it costs $10,615 to send a kid to public school for a year.

You think when they have multiple kids, they are contributing that much in taxes for each kid? Not to mention all the government assistance, free lunches, etc.

And if you need me to source for you that in cities with large amount of MS 13 members need more money to police, then you are not even trying to communicate. Youre doing whatever you can toi "win" the argument. Even claiming our culture, political integrity, 
 and demographic make up dont matter (to you) and the fact we could possibly live in space is a reason to have open boarders.

You might be fine living is mexico but dont make us do it. You can move down there if you want.
You think I cant comprehend a humanist point of view? LOL. I know what it is "Let third worlders flood into your country because they are poor and brown. maybe we can improve the lives of 0.0001% of the worlds suffering!". You are not smart or caring for having these beliefs. It makes you a virtue signaler and an abuser of democracy. You are not a better person for fucking over your countrymen by putting foreign interest before theirs just so you can feel good about yourself.http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2012/04/20/hispanics-favor-bigger-role-for-government/Best Girl No Competition Tbh :)If you want to hate humanity even more listen to some of James O'Brien on LBC. 

When people call in it becomes a shit show of how uninformed ppl have strong beliefs about things they don't know. What do you think cultural marxism is?You know, I'm glad that Sargon has fallen because his ego was getting too big. But Baked Alaska and Andy Warski really piss me off here. Baked Alaska is a retard with no real opinions, and Andy just bends the knee to whoever he's friends with at the time. When he was friends with Sargon, then he could understand why Sargon was busy. But now, Sargon's a pussy that won't debate "soon enough". Fuck all of these people, forreal.She's beautiful and much more entertaining than any of those "booby streamers" in IRL.[I did some digging into his scientific awards and...](https://i.imgur.com/UJzwaMc.png)I'm not saying I advocate for awards, but you could call me a bit of an award realist.[Source.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/7wskyr/jf_calls_himself_the_greatest_scientist_of_his/)I believe in the marketplace of ideas and Reddit votes. JF also believes in the marketplace of ideas. If you zoom in on the text under the pictures you will actually see Jontron is JF's representation for the side against ethnostates.I always say I'm in silver, but I deserve gold. I mean I don't personally watch her on a regular basis, but I'd watch before someone like Pink Sparkles.Wait, why do you think this attitude is because of cultural marxism? Because I don't see a single public figure in the US openly advocating marxism. You don't even know what appeal to authority fallacy is. I presented the argument of someone with athority. You literally just said "athority agrees with me" without presenting argument (even though atsronomers don't have any authority in human geography). You're actually retarded. And you didnt address the argument either

"One day we might end up on space so we should have 0 conflicts, and allow Mexicans and ONLY Mexicans to flood into our country"..... Hoooolyyyy shit dude. You are fooling yourself. You're not smart.

Ms 13 is not an American gang.... It wasn't formed by a bunch of white dudes. And fuck off with your "think of the children" bullshit. Not an excuse for fucking up our elections with outside influenceI love the Andy/JF shit. I just love shitshows. Plus I used to actually like these dudes, and it turns out they're just alt-right cocksuckers.My problem with this comment is like...what are you expecting/hoping for? A subreddit is a place for people with shared interests to discuss the interest, and this community's shared interest is Destiny. I'm sure people who are interested in politics and debates do try to challenge their views *outside* this sub (I myself am subscribed to /r/changemyview and The_Donald) but most of *this* sub politically agrees with Destiny to some extent so I'm uncertain what new ground would be expected to be covered here. Where people do disagree there are definitely debates (including this post's comments), but even then this isn't a debate sub and it's easy and enjoyable to share/look at memes etc. with a community who finds them as funny as you do. It's hard to expect anything else from a fan community - in fact it's impressive to me how much debate there is here already among the memes.Nah doesn't bother me I was just curious about/challenging what you said. You seemed to be making a point that people on the sub don't challenge themselves and are really circlejerky, and I was positing that maybe a fan community isn't the best place for challenging one's viewravenclaw is master race, don't @ meYep, Andy will defend whoever is currently his friend. A few months ago that was Sargon. But now that he's carrying the alt-rights water for them, Sargon is all of the sudden a pussy who won't debate "soon enough". Fuck the lot of them.I swear to god Andy and Ian are the two most idiotic people on the internet with a big-ish fan base. I don't think I've ever heard either of them express a single well reasoned, nuanced thought. I honestly couldn't live like this.I don't understand what he gains from taking the game seriously. Can you fill me in?I posted this just to give some basic insight into postmodernism, lets not dive into Peterson memes right away SWEATSTINY We didnt know suffering until we knew Undertale.anyone else feel like lily's art has been getting better and better

or maybe beautiful subjects like steven make for better art idkYou literally have no arguments then. Your arguments for mass migration is "Muh native americans" and "muh silly planatary conflicts are beneath me" and "Muh Nihilism". Thats it. If I was strawmanning you it's because I was looking for an argument in your (apparently irrelevant) notions, but it turns out you literally dont stand by a single argument than those weak ones I just stated. And youre completely wrong on the fallacy thing, but you wont ever admit to being wrong so I wont even bother. Using a video to explain the counter arguments isnt appeal to authority, its just laziness. You cant dismiss their arguments just because they are not experts, you're not on either. But I CAN dismiss your stupid statements because they arent even arguments for the topic according to you.

Im pretty positive MS-13 emerged from a previous game from El salvador. But even if it was just immigrants making a gang in the U.S, do you really thing that disproves my point? Do you really think they would be such an issue if they werent mass migrating into the country? The country used to only have 5 million hispanics and the rest were blacks and whites, and once we start bringing in hispanic immigrants we suddenly have them forming gangs in our land, interesting correlation. Why do you think that just because they live in america or were born in the U.S, that it somehow has no genetic or cultural links to where their family/community is from. Youre basically saying that the cartel is just American Culture. Thats not a strawman, its literally the only argument you can make other than "muh oppression".

&gt; Says the guy that MAKES bank as a banker but can't support a kid with his wife...


You know that feeling you have? It's called being BTFO and not being able to admit to yourself that you haven't thought this through. Its from knowing deep down your opinions are not thought out and not being able to back them up with reasoning in a real world setting.

I never said I was a humanist because I dont base my politics on impractical ideology, feelings and virtue signaling.

what about when it was 3 lefties vs Mike enoch?What about when it was 3 lefties vs Mike Enoch?well I guess that’s thathttps://twitter.com/shaun_jen/status/954133376931450880 replace warski with whoeverYou didn't read the article.

The bottom line of that take is basically fine imo ("don't put yourself in an echo chamber"), it's more just about the application. Destiny takes a more hard-line approach which makes sense for him - he's someone who's constantly defending his ideas publicly so he wants to make sure he's able to do it (although I do think watching Shaun or Contra's videos would be useful to him). A trans person is basically always consuming opposing sources in their life so they probably don't have as much a requirement to watch Sargon of Akkad videos. 

Personally a big part of the reason I watch Destiny is that I hear *both* sides of an argument, and sometimes find myself understanding the opposing viewpoint a little better. I don't really watch *lots* of conservative media (besides being subbed to The_Donald and watching occasional Shapiro/Peterson videos and rolling my eyes) because it's just not entertaining to me and I'd rather spend my time on other things. But I would say there's a difference between that and being in a Skype group echo chamber - and I think avoiding echo chambers and remaining intellectually curious is the main takeaway from Destiny's point rather than "don't befriend leftists if you're a leftist".


Wait sorry did I say echo chamber I meant etchoI do try to give the anti-peterson rancor a fair shake because there is enough of it it seems you must have some good reason.

But every time I dig in I get a sour taste that it's sort of manufactured. Like why criticise him for being influenced by Cambell? Why criticise Cambell for influencing star wars?

I like Campbell.

Why should I keep reading this?It was a good read, thank you for sharingUndertale is just a shit game, feels bad that he has to play it. At least he's not DSP and doesn't do what his goals say.IQ is actually correlated with financial success, so youre wrong.

They have accounted for environment by doing twin studies. If its not environment its genetic.

None of you people know what youre talking about.“If the average IQs of blacks, Southeast Asians, and Hispanics are lower than the average IQs of non-Hispanic whites and Northeast Asians, **then the racial disproportionality in (HISP) is justified,**” the hypothesis said, according to the outlet.


Nice strawman. You people are over-emotional children who dont even read the articles before shouting racism.
You do know there have been tons of studies other than this student's right?no, its not. It means we dont have to try to have "equal representation".elaborate?Bunty just seems to operate under the assumption of the common political adage that "we just need to talk to each other"what does that have to do with taking something wholesale?Well even if it was a significant environmental factor, its irrelevant. Why they have lower IQ's doesnt actually matter to her hypothesis. The point is that for whatever reason, They have lower average IQ's, so one should not expect them to be as represented in gifted programs.He does not know what postmodernism really is. That is the most concrete and verifiable argument made against him. At best postmodernism seems to be a loosely connected cultural movement by a few guys and women who were affected by the rise of fascism. Peterson seems to view it as some type of insidious, think-tank cabal, like the free masons or somethingIt's a highschool project, what do you expect, peer reviewed? And yes they have done studies on IQ differences, and no matter what the reason there is an IQ difference, do you think that we should pick the students for these programs based on a quota? What if they are low IQ because they are poor. Does that mean we need to put them in with the higher performing Asian kids in the honor class just because theyre black? You think that will be good for their self esteem? You think that wont slow the class down?Yes, You guys are totally right. IQ is a made up thing that has no correlation to intelligence, achievement or financial success. You guys really know what youre talking about. Why is IQ even a thing? Its just a word made up by white supremacists anyway. We should lower standards of blacks and mexicans because of the oppresion of whitey making them do bad in school. But we should also raise the standards of asians because they have the best environmental factors, even more than whites!&gt; My entire point is why would you do a flawed study to simply re-affirm this axiomatic truth?

Procrastinating on a Highschool project

Leftists denying reality makes it easy to do a science project on the most obvious shit. Maybe there were the main arguments in there about the environmental factors and how significant they are compared to genetic. I dont know I didnt read the project.wow, you were triggered easily. this sub is full of the most emotional, pseudollectual children ever.

do you know how many kids probably did papers on the wage gap lie because its a common misconception promoted my leftists? Lies make misconceptions.&gt;Comedian walks up on stage

&gt;Stands there silently for minutes

&gt;A-aren't you supposed to say some-

&gt;ITS UP TO HIM IF HE WANTS TO TALK OR NOT!!!!!!111111multiculturalism isnt genocide, but mass migration for 50 years can be.they did cover it misleading. Obama said for the same work. Commercials said for the same work. My own professor did too.

And yea argue with people on reddit because its so easy to see how brainwashed people are by seeing how they justify mass migration into white countries and only white countries (and only democrat voting mexicans for U.S ruining the integrity of our democracy). One of you destiny faggots literally said possible space colonization is a valid reason.Yeah, no shit. And it's up to me whether or not I call his show retarded.

No one is making the argument that Destiny shouldn't be allowed to act like this, they're just voicing their disagreement with it. Learn the difference.I love watching Rogans mind break in this video. Joe Rogan, from what I have watched, has a vested interest in traditional masculinity. Its where he draws his energy from. Kinda meathead-ish. When someone challenges those beliefs he does not know what to doI agree 100%. At the beginning he makes a good case, but he allows Joe Rogan to keep diverging. After Russell had to re explain himself again, it seems he has effectively given up.

I keep trying to tell people that live debate is kind of hard for certain people, especially the more you know. For example, lets say you are arguing about evolution with a creationist. You have researched, have a strong conceptual understanding, maybe he even gas read a few academic papers. The creationist then says "people arent pokemon, we dont have evolutions" at this point you realize that all your research, studying, and general inquiry is for naught, because the creationist is 15 steps behind you and instead of making progress you have to trudge through the path of reasoning that got you to where you may have been years agoI've seen No Bullshit lie a million different times, I'm pretty sure he's both incredibly dishonest AND stupid.Saying that Destiny is "supposed to talk" is not laying out some natural law that applies to streamers, it's simply referring to an expectation that's generally placed on streamers. Destiny broke the expectation; ergo, people are disappointed.I'm just so happy that mainstream outlets are publishing Zizek's work semi-routinely and that he doesn't have to resort to RT.com, which published quite a bit of articles from him. He is one of the best cultural and social critics out there. Deserves more love and attention. I think he's fully right about the left as well, even though I disagree with him (or Lacan rather, maybe) about some things as well, such as jealousy always being pathological.I'm the one with reading comprehension? I said white people can't afford to have kids, not me and my wife. You're wrong about all of this. If the country was all white crime would be much lower, government handouts would be lower, and even if that wasn't the case, just the fact that we are losing political power I our own country is enough to say we don't need more mass migration. You don't have any argument.

And do you know what the 13 stands for is MS13? If I'm migration isn't to blame, it's multiculturalism. Doesn't help your argument.Why do you think he's being ironic? He seems to genuinely have a lot of respect for him since he knows he's one of the most well known, if not the most, psychoanalyst out there, and Peterson loves psychoanalysis. He's even more succesful than Peterson imo, when it comes to being a public intellectual. For instance, Zizek was written for the NYT and has made a movie. I think it's more like people and their love for Barack Obama or Bill Clinton (or any other president really). They know under Obama's regime, many people, some of them Americans, were killed without due process, something which any reasonably minded liberal would object to, but choose to like him anyway because he represents hope and change.He has basic common sense which a lot of the mainstream debate lacks these days and a way of voicing himself well, but then he also says completely ridiculous crap that is very occult and esoteric. Hmm it's almost as though you can appreciate some of a person's ideas without agreeing with everything they say.And here I thought I would be the first one to post Zizek related to stuff to counter all the bull shit Peterson nonsense this subreddit was experiencing. Glad to know we have some Zizek fans here, also a bonus meme of Zizek v Peterson on Lion King https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55vfIhkIYBgI've been dreaming of a Peterson v Zizek debate, I really hope it happens
Demographic replacement, disrupting democracy by mass migrating a group that votes overwhelmingly for one party and reducing the power of the native citizens who built the society.Yes, mass migrating 3rd worlders who don't assimilate is totally a practically way to help 0.00001% of the world's suffering. No consequences for those already living there. And it's not like human history ISNT full of societies making themselves minorities. Nationalism has never been tried, totally impractical to make decision based on the citizens rather than foreigners. You don't have any arguements. You don't have to watch the videos I posted  to know you're wrong and morally inconsistent. You think the natives Americans built this society? The most they built was a couple huts and a couple boats, doesn't justify giving the country to Mexicans, they weren't even a unified group.Yeah Terraria has plenty of endgame content and a bit of a path to follow in progress.

&gt;choose scandanavia for socialism stats

how selective

lets see how those stats look after its been a non homogeneous country for a few years, also when they need to pay for their own defense.

And it doesnt matter what Europeans do. America was formed by the braver more independent of those countries and we dont need people to vote for gibs just because europe does thatIsrael is very ethnonationalist, so is Japan. Its not that I dont care about kids, its just that I dont care about foreign kids more than my own, and I know we cant get even close to saving even half a percent of the suffering. Do you think Israel and Japan should be forced to take in third worlders until they are minorities in their own country?Andy said lefties never respond to his invitations to debates. There will be a 1v1 tonight and when Mike Enoch wins you will have no excuseI can’t speak for everyone but as the person who posted this, I was making a joke just cause Greek asked about it. Destiny could be banging Mr.Mouton or Andy Warski for all I care.Did you know they remove people who say this on the offline tv subreddit.Center-left before, center-left after. I sought an online personality with similar beliefs and found it.centre-left, now pretty far-left (not communist yet tho)Yeah that's what I thought too, like I always assumed they were dating. I respect them wanting to keep it quiet cause of Lily's fans, but removing posts is kinda extreme to me.As a mailman I'd say his love of dogs was the most morally reprehensible thing about him, but I take your point.Center-Left/Social-Democrat before and the same after.Destiny could leech without being a leech. Being on a stream with 15k viewers is a benefit IMO. It gives Destiny more exposure. a true prophetYeah, what happened to Gary?[morenazi](https://mosereien.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/mexikanische-nazis.jpg)no, we should not set example of giving the country and democratic power to those who did not build or fight for this country. Previous generations fought for and built this country for us, not third worlders who will not vote in our interest. I dont know why you keep thinking I want to be socialist. And socialism works better in homogeneous societies. Whites use much less government assistance per capita so the less white we have the more money is taken from the tax payer and given to minorities just because they choose to have kids when they cant afford them and have no problem taking advantage of the systems of those they do not care for. 

Europeans put the group over the individual. Blacks do that too, but whitey isnt appart of that group so they dont mind taking advantage of them.please dude, slavery produced cotton, in the early years of the country. The only thing blacks have contributed besides that is peanut butter and the street light.

Socialism works when the nation puts the group above the individual. But what do you think happens when there are subgroups? They dont mind taking advantage of each other.

Honestly what europe does is irrellevant. What happens in america, is minorities use government assistance WAY more than whites. Its not good to bring in more leeches. 

What Europe does is a non-argument

Ive given you many arguments. How about immigrants going to make the country one party?
Curious, what was the point of creating this thread?In context of what though? Compared with left leaning channels, the right seemed to gained somewhat of a foothold on Youtube.I don't look at it that way, and Buzzfeed doesn't do politics in a way that for example Kyle Kulinski does for the Left and PJW does for the right. 

I mean PJW has 1.1 million subs, 267 million views.
           Crowder has 1.3 million subs, 300 million views and is averaging 11 million views a month.
           Mark Dice has 1.2 million subs, 470 million views and is averaging 15 million views a month.
           Infowars has 2.2 million subs, 1.5 Billion views and is averaging 21 million views a month. 
There's Molyneax, Styx, Southern, Sargon, Milo, Jordan Peterson, Warski, Roaming Millanial, Blaire White, Candice Owens, Dave Rubin, PragerU, One America News, The Rebel, Gavin Mcinness, and dozens of more channels like the OP mentioned in the meme image. this country was 85-95% white for its entire existence up until 50 years ago. It says in the preamble that the country was to be for European descendants. This country was built by whites for their white children. Thinking otherwise is just stupid.

White people consider minorities as part of them often, but rarely is it the other way around.

You dont think there is anything wrong with a party flooding the country with certain foreigners to gain their votes? And criticism of that is fascism? What if republicans started flooding the country with ukranian republicans until blue states started turning red? Bet you wouldnt like that would you.

And no, there many white people who have to much pride to use government assistant. Minorities use much more per capita because they also dont mind having a bunch of kids because they know we will pay for their children. It's not just being poor, its also poor decisions. And being poor isnt an excuse to drain the host society by making them pay for your children and abusing emergency rooms.

If white people take advantage of others so much why do they flood into our conutry and we give them free stuff. We even discriminate against ourselves to try to compensate for their incompetence.

Well reality is racist to you people so calling us racist doesnt matter. Is it racist to point out black and mexicans commit more crime or is it reality? Is it racist to point out they have lower IQ's on average? Is it racist to point out affirmative action is discrimination?

And yes, fascism is temporary. It's basically a cleansing of a society. Tyler Oakley and Casey Neistat don't make Youtube content related to politics and are certainly not known for their political views. TYT are about as mainstream as InfoWars. For every Jimmy Dore, and Pakman, they're dozens of right leaning youtube channels. Point is a lot of the names I mentioned above were not even know 2-4 years ago and have rapidly gained in popularity.

because of their libcuck sjw agenda that’s whyGlad you agree.Hm I kinda wish she was a little bit more accurate with the detail about "Destiny made fun of his appearance, and Tonkasaw hadn't been very nice to Destiny either" - it was more the fact that Tonkasaw kept threatening to beat Destiny up and then Destiny posted the image of Tonka being super skinny to demonstrate that Tonka was posturing

It's kind of a small thing but it's the difference between "hey look at this skinny guy" and "your threats aren't very credible"can't argue with thatLord's mobile paying him sponsorship money may have been the best decision they ever made. Not only did he become addicted, he has spent thousands of dollars on the game, got others in his community to sink time and money into it, and is still consistently streaming it every day. Good job PR guy. I mean, he did one with Sargon, and Destiny has a lot of history with Sargon. Destiny also has a lot of history going for him, one of the oldest still standing twitch streamers who has done it fulltime. Lots of political stuff as well. Sidenote, I think i remember Joe saying "There was a lot of people who wrote to me, that I should have you on, so I had to look into who you were".  
Perhaps we need to let Joe know about Destiny in a good way, and why it could be a good podcast? Cause his fans let Joe know they wanted him on. We need to do the sameExskillsme on suicide watch.Do you think it is a good idea to buy &amp; wear one of these ironically?
Liberal SJWs at a no name publication smeared him as Alt-Right.I agree with you that it's highly unlikely that the Trump campaign helped the Russians hack the DNC/Clinton campaign; however, isn't the main part of the collusion hypothesis that the Trump campaign was given and used the information that the Russians found?how are they “winning”? and what are they “winning”? are you talking about how after every dog-pile on destiny they all claim that destiny got btfo?  thats what posterity means.. Revolution doesnt mean demographics change, which would explain the White only immigration policy.

Hitler made a greaty society, he didnt destroy it.

"Muh slavery, muh oppresion of black people, now you must give the country to mexicans who are even more racist than whites."It would surely be more realistic. According to the same government statistics, the teacher to student ratio is around 16 students per teach, which means there are 6250 teachers per 100,000 students. [In comparison USA has around 284 police officers per 100,000 citizens.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_number_of_police_officers)

In terms of costs, this would of course be additional full-time employees rather than stretching out the tasks of your currently employed teachers – good for the teachers but probably bad in terms of costs. Training a police officer is probably going to be more expensive than providing classes and some shooting practice to your existing staff.

In terms of efficiency, it's hard to tell. I prefer other the path that other countries have taken, to simply reduce the number of shootings in the first place in a more pro-active way. A couple of officers patrolling each school could surely ensure fewer students are killed before the shooter is cornered and/or killed, but that doesn't sound like a good enough result.

Getting enough police officers to reach the same "good-gun density" as the teachers would achieve just doesn't seem realistic. There are 913,161 police officers (2015) and 3.2 million teachers (2015 or 2016, can't remember) in USA.

Either way, this choice is made at a crossroad. If you recognize that shooters are often fighting mental illness and suicidal tendencies it will hardly prevent the actual shooting from taking place; it's rather a measure to make sure that a shooter is stopped (killed) as soon as possible. Whether that is a complete psychopath who carefully planned to execute as many innocents as possible or a more impulsive attack (i.e suicidal with destructive tendencies and "today" was the day it became too overwhelming), it doesn't seem like the risk of dying is either overlooked or accounted for.

&gt; Is anybody serious actually advocating for that other than retard radio talk show hosts??

Seems to be equal or above the level of the people Destiny fall victim to in his debates. It's probably not helpful to engage with trolls on their level, but even if it's just retarded radio talk show hosts talking about it seriously it is worth arguing against. If the alt-right or Republicans are allowed to contest gun control arguments with vague statements and platitudes there won't be much progression. ***Did someone mention giving a gun to every teacher? Oboy, we're not leaving this discussion until you've made your point loud and clear, or came to the conclusion that it's a dumb idea.***
Is that assuming that USA is unable to move an inch in terms of gun policy, e.g availability of guns for teenagers?The Bible and the first ten amendments to the constitution is enough for the country as a whole. /sNobody said arming every teacher would be an easy feet.That's a good perspective. The argument of 'retro- versus pro-active' can't be conceded on arming teachers being pushed as a proactive measure. When looking at it as a spectrum, as you describe, it's in the center; far from the most proactive ways to counter the problem. As big of an operation it would be to arm every teacher, it isn't aiming to have an impact to the fundamental causes of school shootings – it's hoping that a teacher would win a shoot-out with the killer and thus decrease the number of deaths, and in best case scenario make a shooter re-think the risk of death (but that seems unlikely, considering that risk is already a part of the equation).It's surely no safe bet if they'd decide to pay for arming all teachers. Holy shit, would I not want to deal with the aftermaths of an innocent student getting shot or even killed by a teacher.low effort memes tiptipThat's a good reasonFunny, I feel the same way. Although when Lily is with her OfflineTV friends playing games IRL, it can be entertaining.I agree with you on principle, but I think you can go even deeper when addressing the issue fundamentally.I think Destiny mentioned that they are funded by property taxes, but I'm not sure exactly how that works out.Problem with Jim is all he cares about is that type of Jerry Springer style shit show. Which yes can be very entertaining as he says, but not productive in the overall discourse and people will unironically start thinking what's being said as gospel. [Mine](http://www.politiscales.net/en_US/results/?j1=31&amp;j0=38&amp;p0=14&amp;p1=45&amp;m1=24&amp;m0=45&amp;c0=29&amp;femi=14&amp;c1=50&amp;t0=38&amp;t1=40&amp;e1=60&amp;e0=31&amp;s1=19&amp;s0=55&amp;b1=33&amp;b0=31&amp;prag=100)

Surprised by my 33% nationalism. Must be the youtube bloodsports getting to me. monkaSAm I still supposed to care about this guy? There's no real point in finding out shit like this. We know he's a fucking idiot and unless there's something groundbreaking, I vote we keep him off this subreddit tbh.LOL yes, everyone in the U.S at that time were EUROPEAN. Saying the country is for their posterity means its for THEIR, EUROPEAN DECEDENTS. You think they were talking about the entire world? Lol youre fucking stupid.

And if you are ignorant of how Hitler turned a collapsed nation into a world power then I dont know what to tell you other than youre wrong.

Go to mexico and see how they treat their minorities. I bet they would deport as many blacks and people who are from the south of them as they can. They always have whites on T.V. Their news channels are more white than our own. You know nothing. 

They might not openly talk about deporting people from the U.S, because ITS NOT THEIR COUNTRY. It's not even as much about race as it is bringing forigners with foreign cultures in. And they will cause the U.S to be a one party system. Thats not "muh ancestry", Thats actual concern for the democratic integrity of the country. And Why should we replaced just because we dont vote democrat? We already discriminated for our "White priviledgfe", But if you look at the priviledge tests colleges give, its actually majority privilege. But do you think that will stop them from using "White privilege" as an excuse to discriminate against us and redistribute our wealth? Why are you ok with replacing the people who built this country? Youre either an evil person who donsnt mind massively changing the country so your party can win, or youre just stupid and dont see whats going on. You really think there arent consequences to all this? You really think only whites should not be allowed to have a country? I have a hard time believing that truck attacks will rack up the same number of fatalities as a shooter with an assault rifle, but maybe that's just me?No fuck them, they want to debate Destiny they should go to his platform. No more of this Tonkasaw or RaceWarski shit shows with 4v1 5v1 people attacking Destiny.He could have got "com ga xoi mo" which is like deep fried chicken with rice, wouldn't be that bad. 0u0That's so Destiny.I remember seeing a thread here of someone who archived all of Destiny's vods.

Edit. Oh, maybe not all the vods though.She also has a black rabbit named Neville.Maybe a week. I'll look for it.

Edit, here it [is](https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/7x1oon/last_week_on_destiny_25211/)

It's funny because I had a roommate who literally drank chocolate milk every day. I thought it was just a personal thing, but I guess MANLETS are addicted to that good ole Ovaltine. Jk, he was actually a cool dudepersonally, I have a hard time believing that an attack with a Molotov cocktail and a bus could rack up the same number of fatalities as a shooter with an assault rifle, but maybe that's just me?&gt; My question to you is, are you really trying to downplay 4 dozen kids getting hit in a moly attack because you think a rifle would get more? The entire point im making is that banning all guns wouldn't mean shit because your faggot kids are still deranged homicidal maniacs and will find some other way to mass murder people.

My point is that guns inevitably makes the result worse, especially when it comes to individuals committing the attacks (rather than say, terror groups with a political motive) – even the most planned attacks seem very impulsive in terms of motivation.

&gt; are you really trying to downplay 4 dozen kids getting hit in a moly attack because you think a rifle would get more?

I'm saying that from a philosophical and practical stand-point, less is better than more. When searching for the kind of Molotov attacks you speak of, they don't seem to be as deadly as shootings are.

* [2 deaths, 34 injured](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/2-killed-34-injured-in-molotov-attack-on-south-africa-bus-1218064)

* [0 deaths, 0 injured](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/696233/French-teens-Allahu-Akhbar-molotov-cocktail-bus)

* [5 deaths, 5 injured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jericho_bus_firebombing)

It isn't very productive to discuss hypothetical scenarios in comparison to real events that happens regularly, but if your question is whether Molotov attacks or gun attacks are worse – my answer is definitely gun attacks. That's not to say I want no proactive measures against bombings/fire attacks, like restricting chemicals or requiring escape plans in case of a fire in a building.Pretty much my thoughts exactly. 

I just hope if it doesn't work out, they can remain good friends who play games together.you're my hero dudeGood find, thanks for posting
these are some spicy memes, that is going to be a nice debate It would have been fun to see this call on stream. Why even do a vote for the server we all know you're going to make the end decision no matter what.  [](/PEPE)Very few callers in any format but especially talk radio can out do the radio host. Yeah I think I read that too.True. Plus he's not reading any supa chats that are calling him a pedophile either.Can someone upload it to a non-aids site? It keeps freezing, and I can't download it without getting network error.When was this recorded?This sub meme quality has gone up recently SeemsGoodIf you check the first few words of each line you'll be able to put it together. It's all fucked up though so it's hard to tell.Wonder what the sentence would have been for a brown guyi'd say out of all the Daily show correspondents(Sam Bee, Trevor Noah, Jordan Klepper, Larry Wilmore, Colbert, etc..) and entertainment/comedy shows; John Oliver has the best content.lul people still unironically thinking guns will save them from the government lulI liked JF when he was on DP back before they fell to shit. Really sad to see what he's become. Just email him or something, or spend the rest your life in Twitch chat.FREEEEEEEEEE AlbertoFUCBOI!!!!I didn't see, then yeah just wait it out lol.What's his reputation?Sure, encourage a healthy lifestyle and weight loss. But why go out of your way to verbally abuse fat people? Have some decency. Fat people are aware they're fat and if changing it came easy to them, they would have done it already. Of proteins vs vegtables vs grains-starches, grains-starches are the cheapest and most useless, besides the base calories.

If you can afford it, it's probably better for you just to eat proteins and vegtables.

At many points in history, that would not have been enough for people to survive though, so many cusines work grains and starches in. Originally out of necessity, but it becomes part of the cooking tradition.

Destiny is right, but I think he was a little tone deaf. It's one thing to try to rebel against a toxic social norm that makes everyone fat. That is good.

It's another thing to brag about not being poor. Probably the more grains and starches you eat vs proteins and vegtables, the less money you spend on food.

If you have the money, it's better not to and maybe some people just don't know that. But if you don't it might be annoying to be told that.

Lentils are cheap at least. And there are lots of cheap meats that become tender if you slow cook it.

Eating less grains and starches is probably a good idea unless you are literally going to starve otherwise.You are not understanding what I am saying.

I'm not saying starch is bad, I'm saying vegetables that are only starch are pointless to eat if you have alternatives.

Vegetables with some starch but also protein and other stuff along with the starch is better, like lentils or asparagus.

edit: I see why you were confused actually. I was saying cheap = bad, and then called lentils cheap. Really I was trying to suggest lentils were an exception to the general rule.

Basically the idea is, if you want to cut down on calories but not be hungry, cut out the empty calories first. Those are the least likely to be filling anyway.

The biggest source of empty calories is pure sugar, like soda.

The next is starches and grains.Potatoes are the only vegetables that have calories?

No. Lentils, chickpeas, beans. Lots of things have starch or other carbohydrates without having only or close to obly carbohydrates.

Also, nuts have calories too. So does oil, like olive oil.

Basically I am saying don't eat filler period. No point, when most people are overeating anyway.

Like if you want to think of food as just taste and filer, why not put soy sauce on a pile of sugar? It's the same model.

Rice and pure starch is just bland sugar.

edit: I know nuts are not a vegetable but you seem to be saying you can only get calories from either meat or potatoes.

edit2:

Basically the bottom line is avoid eating sugar unless you are getting something else along with it. In a mixture of stuff, you will be ok, but just sugar alone is bad.

I don't want to get into the technicalities of what is a vegetable and what isn't because it doesn't matter and I don't really care. Just make sure you are not eating pure sugar. It's pretty simple. Complex sugars are still sugars.I could be completely wrong but aren't most of those countries (if not all) communist and not socialist?Would you say that the arguments go right through the counter-strike?Bunty complaining about Micheal Moore is pure autism. He attended an anti-Trump rally that was supposedly organized by Russian bots? So what, Moore goes to many anti-Trump events for good reasons, he's not spreading fake news or misinformation but apparently attending 1 of many rallies means Moore was dupped by Russian bots?? wtf??/u/stanlot said it best. Opinionated af. At most legit ethnic restaurants rice is legit a staple of the dish. It might not be as expensive as the chicken/steak/or pork but that still does not justify the sperg-esque rant he went into. He reminds me of that guy eats one,maybe two go-to dishes year round. 

Also, Destiny talking about how everyone in the US is fat because they would shovel the rice in their face was laughably retarded. As someone who has Destiny's frame, kinda short, with no muscle. He might want to chill at the downward social comparison. It's super cringe throwing rocks from a glass house, when he has the body of a child.

I mean I am super critical rn. But, I mean was anything I said that wrong.Ill put it like this. Destiny is aware, in my opinion, of how fucked he is when it comes to food. If you are an American I think it might be hard to understand this. I am going to assume you are. I know of people, who legit don't eat anything despite what they grew up with as children. It's sad, but I think that is where Stevey is at rn. His parents probably let him eat whatever and now he is a grown man who drinks chocolate milk and eats pizza like it is going out of style&gt;Someone stole his car and tried to blackmail him to tell the day9 story

&gt;His goons caught up with the guy and reclaimed the car

&gt;He made up this story to cover it up

DON'T BELIEVE HIS LIESI have never quite understood the practicality of it. If we genetically engineer for lets say height or intelligence would that make us more susceptible to viruses or diseases because we would be more genetically similar? Maybe if it was heavily regulated and the changes were implemented slowly and with care. Under private ownership. Hell no!My fav part about Twitter Destiny was that I feel like it was a really good way for him to get debates set up (and sometimes it led to good memes)

I do see how he kinda overdid it thothe political interests of anglos, and non anglo whites, are not really different. However, we all know about the coalition of the brown's interests are not in the best interest of whites. It's not like anyone used mass migration of one white group to gain power over another white group, its not even close to the same. There wasnt a political war between anglos and non anglos. Its literally browns (and pathetic whites) vs whites in the U.S.

I build shit all day. My parents and grandparents have paid taxes their entire lives to help build this country. I didnt myself, but MY PEOPLE, the ones who have the same political and racial interests as me, did. Its about party lines, and the only people who vote republican are whites, so flooding the country with non-whites is just a way to stamp out the ONLY Political party that represents white interests. They get to vote against us all while using and abusing the society WE built through generations of hard work. Do you even know of the concept of inheritance? If your parents leave you money in their will, can we just give it to some mexican family because "you didnt earn that BRO, we need to give it to these guys because they vote for me- I mean because youre white and should feel guilty."

Immigrants will always vote for redistribution of white wealth to them, that will never change. Parties are drawn along racial lines. Whites are the only group stupid enough to go against their own interest and vote for anti white policies because of their white guilt. Democrats are literally using white and asian money to flood the country with hispanics in order to gain power. It's not paranoia that there are many anti white policies and rhotoric. It's a fact and it isnt a coincidence that they replaced "majority priviledge" with "white privilege". The group of people who built and maintained being the majority has all the same privileges, and more. You can pretend race doesnt matter all you want, but it matters. Even if whites try to go against their human nature of tribalism, everyone else will not play into that and take over the societies white built.

And there are far more arguments than just the abuse of democracy
Better than Andy. Credit where it's due.You know what, I truly do believe this. You're wrong about all of this. Seriously. Hispanics have not been here for that long, therefore they have not been paying taxes to build the country up for generations after generations. You can say "muh black people" to justify shifting the demographics around with mexicans until you get the democratic outcome you want. 

There are.only two parties. One is anti white and the other takes white interests into account. you think saying g Republicans advocate for whites is as bad as Democrats literally admitting to trying dispossess whites and redistribute their wealth? Grow up this is how the real world works. You think it's any worse than when democrats fight for everyone not white? Which by default makes them anti white.

Everything else I'm not rebutting is just straight up wrong.
This is just getting old, I'm arguing with an immoral person who is brainwashed into believing it's moral to change the demographics of ONLY white countries until we get the democratic outcome YOU want.

I don't take pride in other accomplishments, Joe Rogan is an idiot anyway. I just dont want the country to be completely changed just for votes. I want the country I was supposed to inherit. No one argues to take Japan from the Japanese youth. Rogan doesn't call them stupid for trying to maintain the future and demographics of a country. I do believe Rogan is actually stupid, but he's not even talking about abusing demographics to win elections.&gt;especially unprovoked.

But he hurt my fee fees, so I'm totally justified in exercising lethal force, also pedophile and something something daughter. Does anybody have a link to the comments?&gt;"To grasp the audacity of what Scalia &amp; Co. pulled off, turn to the Second Amendment’s text: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” To find in that wording an individual right to possess a firearm untethered to any militia purpose, the majority performed an epic feat of jurisprudential magic: It made the pesky initial clause about the necessity of a “well regulated Militia” disappear. Poof! Gone. Scalia treated the clause as merely “prefatory” and having no real operative effect—a view at odds with history, the fundamental rules of constitutional interpretation, and the settled legal consensus for many decades."

She may be referenced in all of them but the only one even mentioning her game is a list of 50 steam green light titles. Is that the corruption you're talking about?jesus this is pretty funny. You will say ANYTHING to justify changing demographics in order to win.

We use Japan as an example of a successful country that no one tried to force immigrants into (to the point of them losing their country). It doesnt have to be Japan, its every non white country that is not burdened to flood themselves with immigrants. US HAVING BLACK SLAVES DOES NOT MEAN WE MUST GIVE OUR COUNTRY TO MEXICANS!?!?!?. That makes NO sense. Man its funny seeing the amazing hoops you guys jump through.


It's actually funny, you think mexicans built this country when theyve only been here in significan numbers for 50 years. YOURE The one who doesnt understand.

Yea GOP is anti mass immigration and government handouts, so I guess theyre just anti people of color? Not giving minorities whitey's stuff is racist!

The hole "white people are socialist so you must make the U.S more mexican to remain American" is so pants on head retarded its impressive.

and it is not important to point out the useless 3rd parties in the U.S. Youre just being stupidThe extent of her being featured is a three word blurb and the title. This might call some attention to her game but it's so minor an issue that it's hardly worth taking note of. Given the issues in games journalism why is does this stand out at all?Too little effort. First of all, when you say things like "no one has been here that long", it's not crazy to assume you meant that everyone has been here for almost the same amount of time which is not true. It's not a strawman, I'm just trying to find an actual argument in you bullshit statements.

Japan might not have had slaves but not being homogenous does not mean we need to mass migrate people into the country. That's retarded.

"We are all people, how dare you notice we are mass migrating people who only vote Democrat and are turning states blue, that's racist!"

Of course I fucking know in the early stages of the country it wasn't Dems and Republicans. It's just not relevant anymore. You're ridiculous.

Have you ever noticed that the only countries where socialism works, are homogenous.?  And non of that even matters because American whites do not vote for guns, I won't deny the ethnic difference there. Doesn't justify fucking everything up with mass migration.

Also you're a woman right? "Kthx". Makes sense, women have no instinct to protect their land, or are you a gay Hispanic?

And immigrants vote for the party that promises to make the demographic more like them, which wasn't even a possibility until 1965How would you feel if a girl stuck a finger in your ass or bit you during sex without asking first?thank you, naggerdaggerstabberHuh? It's in the 2016 debate with Destiny. She claims to be a teacher in some college and is insanely afraid of losing her job over people doxxing her and her having abhorrent views.Do you even speak English?I'll do it, I'll start practicing my "ree" nowWhites made the country. Just because there was a very few amount of mexican here, does not mean we must mass migrate them until the people who built this country are a minority. Yes some whites immigrated here later, but they dont cause the issues hispanics do. They dont cause racial division. They dont benefit from affirmative action and they dont all vote for gibs at ridulous rates. They dont abuse the Emergency room and dont crowd our schools. They dont fill our prisons and they dont make us have to learn their language. They dont have more babies than they can afford, They dont form gangs. They dont increase our obesity rates and lower our average IQ. Dont try to pretend all races would love each other and its only white people who are racist, black and mexicans hate each other. Hispanics dont even assimulate, and when they do, second generations assimluate into black culture, which is not good for our  crime rates. Second generation are actually far worse than first generation immigrants.


you are being so thick. Just because we were only 85%-95% white, doesnt mean we must make whites a minority with mass migration of mexicans. How does that make any sense. You wouldnt say that for any non-white country, stop being retarded. 

&gt;So if America becomes 95% white, are you for socialism?

Actually I wouldnt mind it, because whites dont milk and abuse the system like brown people do

&gt;When did the democratic party promise to make demographics of the country more like its voters?

UHh are you fucking serious? Chain migration, DACA, Sanctuary cities, diversity lotteries, Obama literally said he wouldnt  come after illegals who vote (and yes, illegals actually can vote in local ballots, not federal)

&gt;So, I guess the GOP can ONLY appeal to white people then right? Can't they fight for votes as expected? Cmon bruh, be honest with yourself, you want a one-party rule and you are a fascist.

LOL so only white people arent allowed to collectivize, and WE are the ones making a one party system! BAHAHAHAA thats fucking rich. White people ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO VOTE EVEN CLOSE TO 50/50

&gt;I love how I'M being ridiculous when mister "I'm ALL ABOUT DA FOUNDERS!" doesn't realize that the founders abhorred the idea of political parties being so concrete in this country. So if the founders wishes are irrelevant towards this then I guess the founders thoughts on your precious huwhite ethnostate are also irrelevant.

I literally never said Im ok with a two party system, It's jsut thats the reality. Doesnt justify one of the parties flooding the country with mexicans for easy votes just because things didnt turned out as intended in that regard. Your justification are so horrendous is funny."anything to keep our children save" (except for taking away guns, i guess)I think the new editor will be focused in uploading game play, while Gary will do the other stuff.He helped select these sunglasses though...idk why no one in the united states questions whether it is healthy for a part of your identity to be attached to a weapon used specifically to kill people. I feel like America's gun culture is just a failed project at this point, second amendment memes aside is it worth a mass shooting every six months?There's no such thing as "switching peacefully" to communism. At some point the state needs to seize what people own by force, and that's where things like mass starvation and imprisonment that the Discord retards like to handwave away as mere historical anomalies come in.But you realize that it was split in two for 40 years, one side capitalist and one side communist, right?The ones that have tried the hardest to eradicate capitalism, like the Khmer Rouge, kill off so many of their people that it becomes unsustainable and they collapse. Maybe North Korea is the one example of a country that managed to sustain communism over a long period without either sliding back into market economies (Russia and China) or going down in flames. So that can be your glowing example of utopia.When was this?How this braindead garbage gets upvotes is beyond me. The USA, Japan, Germany, France, Sweden, Canada, Australia, etc. etc. etc. are not fictional countries.How do you "relatively peacefully" seize everyone's farms and factories and other businesses?Sure, capitalism alone does not guarantee prosperity and quality of life. But if you're ever going to make the argument that NK/USSR/Cuba aren't *real* communist countries then you better do it with a gun in your mouth./u/softmachineman is pointing out that after a century of more than half the world's population trying to implement communism, they've failed miserably every time. And somehow he thinks that's an argument in favor of communism.Not exactly; as the other dude said we're never going to find two countries to compare that are identical. But the two sides had a shared economic and political history and they were both bombed to rubble during the war. One side recovered quickly, the other side recovered only after it was amalgamated into the successful capitalist model. EDIT: I was probably conflating your point with the views of the OP and others, so sorry for that.

The idea that humans could ever manage an economy collectively just seems completely impractical. [Deomcracy doesn't work that cleanly.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_paradox) The concentration of economic power is a very bad thing. But a market economy, where everyone is making their own economic decisions, avoids such a concentration much more effectively than a "collective" system where a plurality of people (or their political representatives) are imposing economic decisions on everyone else. A market welfare state where the system is fundamentally capitalist but allows for limited intervention by the state to correct for inequality is not just the best option from a pragmatic standpoint, it's the best option.My entire point was that while you might say that the Khmer Rouge never achieved complete collectivization of all property, they tried harder than anyone else. They shut down all private enterprises and forced everyone onto collective farms. What part of this program is not explicitly communist?

And while I'm arguing for capitalism here I wouldn't hesitate to admit that the Nazism was baseline capitalism with strong state intervention. That can work just fine if the purpose of the state intervention isn't constant war and genocide.Lol I love how you cant even admit this is (or at least was) a white country made by whites.

Being a racist or nationalist doesnt cause division in a homogeneous society. Japan is extremely racist, but they have pretty much no race issues. Its not even just race, its cultural and political as well. Mass migrating into a country at displacement levels and taking advantage of their society all the while refusing to assimilate causes much more issues than "ugh I dont like them why cant those fatties learn english". And do you honestly think demoxrats counting down the days until white become a minority, and telling white people they have all this unfair priviledge isnt devisive as well? You think Hispanics talking shit about white people in spanish right in front of them is not divisive? You think taking over entire communities, increasing crime, overcrowding schools, etc is more divisive than "ugh fuck these guys they need to learn english"?


I Live in California, I literally could not talk to the majority of my coworkers when working construction. You dont know what youre talking about. And no, whites do not do those things at the same rates as hispanics LOL. Youre either blind, stupid, live on a different planet, or just wont concede some basic facts of reality.

Oh wow **after 4 generations only half** SELF IDENTIFY as non-hispanic? You think that is strong evidence? anyone can self identify as literally anything. Look at their views on government compared to the overall population. Also takes more than 3 generations.

http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/12/the-politics-and-demographics-of-food-stamp-recipients/

it doesnt matter how people used to vote. It really doesnt.

So cool of you to not care about the demographics of countries. You just dont care about countries retaining any of their culture or fabric of society. Youre just above that, as long as its a white country, and as long as it's your political party that benefits from it im sure.

I get along with hispanics actually. I dont have a problem with them personally, I have a problem with them politcally. How they vote and how many of them there are, as well as how much money they suck from our government as a group.

&gt; oh yeah, it's the brown people increasing obesity rates and not McDonald's

Have you ever been to a McDonalds in a state with a lot of Mexicans? They probably the target demographic for McDonalds now. But I know you wont concede on any observable facts of reality. You live in a different world where we are all the same and hispanic communities look just the same as whites and have the same lifestyle and behavior.

that’s why I still watch john oliver. for the one off stuff about mega churches or some other random shit that nobody knows about.i stopped watching colbert shorty after trump won and all he jokes had some connection to trumpNot at all. All im saying is that not everything has to be about trump Good riddance you Nazi POSThis delusional motherfucker needs be locked upWas expecting more ads for mobile games on the Amazon tablet. that’s quite the strawman. nowhere did I say that they shouldn’t report on trump. all I’m saying is that these late night hosts need to broaden their horizons when it comes to political comedy because this sort of liberal echo chamber feeds right into the hands of neo/conservatives. Are any of the original sceptics (who were sceptic about religion first and foremost) even still around? That said, I'm not sure why the sceptic community shifted liked this.me: "it says only half of them consider themselves non hispanic after 4 generations"

You:  "no it says they assimulated, youre so stupid"

Me: just because there were a small amount of minorities in the country doesnt mean we must mass migrate mexicans into the county

you: No the country was only 90% white so whites need to become minorities now. I dont care about demographics of the global minority gene pool resposible for the vast majority of human advancements.

Me: Here is data that shows hispanics use more government assistance per capita

you: But whites use it too.. I dont know what per capita is and you need to give your government assistance to the foreigners being used to replace you and vote against you.

Me: here is concrete data that shows hispanics are raising our obesity rates
you: How can you say they are fat there are so many variables youre so dumb


and of course racial division isnt caused by mexicans coming in turning states blue, draining our public funding, incerasing crime and displacing communities. Its the dang white naionalists! It's not that they love their homes, countries communities and people. They just hate minorities (replacing them)! Because they look different! there jsut cant be any other reason!

Youre brown arent you
Why would it get its own chat? Isn't the fact that OverRustle is attached to the d.gg chat like 70% of why we use OverRustle?Well done, nice!Wait, Jayden isn't in a relationship with anyone?Some people just love talking about this stuff.  Both of the previous songs Passion and Hikari/Simple and Clean were coming off of Utada's best album and follow-up to that album respectively. Not only was she a big pop household name in Japan but she was also hitting her peak creative output at the time. It is one of those scenarios where all the right pieces came together at the right time, and Utada has recently come off a 4/5 year hiatus. So... I guess what I am trying to say is I am glad that got her to do the music but this is about what I expected.Is it any more work to come out with this as the streams roll out in comparison to every week. Legit question?(He might be kinda racist)Yeah I’m tired of seeing Destiny, who is soOOo dumb, get destroyed in every debate.Today a man has set himself free. HURRAH! Still the best case study for Poe's Law This is all I want in life.yea fist generation immigrants dont commit as much crime (crime overall, dont look at what crimes they committ though). but guess what, the second generation is usually worse, and they arent counted as immigrants. And you keep forgetting the word **HALF** (how convenient). Not to mention an extrmely small amount of hispanics have even been in the country that long since the boarders only opened up to them 50 years ago. Use your brain. Look up crime rates of hispanics. Also they count many mexican immigrants as white, you can even see it in their mugshots that the classify them as white to fuck the stats up.

Even if whites committed more crime, doesnt mean we must give our country to people who commit less crime.

oh but you dont care if an entire gene pool is bred out of existence, even if that gene pool is responsible for moving the human species further than any other gene pool

you say I strawman, when I NEVER said they are fat because they are hispanic. THeyre fat because they eat like shit and maybe a little bit genetics. 

"muh socieconomic factors".... AKA "Its your fault we make bad decisions and arent as successful as you in your own society WHITEY". When white people came to this country we had nothing and we built a civilization. We give you  people everything, even affirmative action, and you STILL blame us and whine. Pretty pathetic.

youre denial of reality is sad, and your apathy towards the survival of western civilization is pretty low intelligence.

Youre a butthurt brown arent you. Can you just accept that the only reason youre here is because you people vote democrat and save the elite more money.Also just to note, I hate Amy Schumer as well in the fact I don't think she's funny. This video though is literally apropos of nothing, no one is even talking about her, she's not in the news, and at the end he questions the wage gap. Some viewers went full autism over him throwing away rice when he was served and exorbitant amount at a chinese (or asian?) restaurant. It sparked a "discussion" (angry rant) about american (western) food culture.their voting patterns and the fact that so many live in this country without being able to speak the language of the land should be enough for you to know they no longer even need to assimlate because there are so many of them. 

Yes 50 years is a shirt amount of time. A very short amount of time for the native white population to go from 85% white to 56% white. Nothing weird going on there! just casually flooding the country with mexicans and only mexicans!

https://robertlindsay.wordpress.com/2015/06/07/many-whites-are-criminals/

Tell me those guys are white. Tell me that they arent fucking up the statistics with shit like this on purpose. Not to mention Obama financially incentivea schools to not punish minorities and have even caused they to get away with serious crimes.


Oh yes, I forgot the natives basically built this country! Silly me!

Any affarmive action beneifit a white woman can get, a minority can get as well, but they get minority points on top of vagina points, so you argument is invalid. youre basically just saying "that because they descriminate against white men and asians, that somehow it doesnt matter how much money we spend on everyone but ourselves.

Oh man i made a gramatical mistake, Guess my point was invalid! My grammar mistake is just as bad as your apathy of preserving the west and its cultures!


I cant fathom white people having empathy for non whites? Are you serious? We literally discriminate against ourselves to help you helpless people. We are literally giving you our countries, money, and hearts. I have empathy for non whites, but not enough to just give them our entire country so they can drain us of our public funding, displace our culture, and turn us into a one party system.
https://imgur.com/IoRhJal that face How did Destiny actually get the opportunity to talk to Martin Shkreli?I think the guy who made this said it was a meme.

RIP to all the unknown amount of dead Iraqi civilians.yeah not to mention how they went about compromising on the de-baathitizing of the iraqi government, they didn't care about properly making sure they were only getting rid of Saddam supporters and ended up stripping the Iraqi government of desperately needed bureaucrats care to elaborate on the "master-plan" that they followed?Yikes indeed lol.

A lot of socialists and communists switched sides to the Nazi party pre-WW2. There's even a special term for them: Beefsteak Nazis. About 70% of Sturmabteilung recruits were leftists.History is a lot more complicated than that. The nazi party had a "left wing" until it was wiped out in the Night of the Long Knives at the request of capitalists. The nazi party was considered a "third position"; an ideology beyond left and right uniting points of view from the left and the right, and a reactionary movement to both capitalism and communism, rejecting both ideologies. It's also the reason why the horseshoe theory shouldn't be just a meme.I think many modern day leftists would support an authoritarian oppressive regime. wow, all of those rebuttals are super weak, and most need to deny reality. Pretty pathetic.Why were you being so autistic in Bunny's chat and discord?I could point out how theyre weak, but you will just deny reality. so whats the point? Ill do it anyway

Wanting to be able to communicate with my fellow countrymen stopped in the 1930's? Didn't know that. I guess the only thing we should have in common is the general area that we live and the laws we are supposed to abide by right? There is no such thing as cultural value if its a white culture right? No value of social cohesion or general identity of a country? No need to talk to white people in their white countries while we take advantage of them, that just so outdated!


No fucking shit there are more than just mexicans immigrating, but mexicans are the largest growing demographic, and largest mass of migration. How many whites are coming over in comparison? Almost none. Youre just being stupid. Of course there are asians but they are not growing at the same rate and dont come with nearly as many problems. Oh but nuance doesnt exist for you does it.


You think that because white women get vagina points that somehow the rest of affirmative action doesnt disadvantage whites? Dont be this stupid please.

you say some stupid bullshit about the natives, I rebutted with sarcasm. I know you didnt say natives built the country. Thats what IM saying. What happened to them sucks, doesn't justify opening our boarders so democrats can turn every state.


you used grammatical correction in place of an argument which is pathetic.

We do discriminate against ourselves, otherwise affirmative action wouldnt exist. We wouldn't give minorities a bunch of benefits just for being non white. Youre just denying reality all over the place

And again, you deny the reality (or are just ignorant) that immigrants are turning states blue. There is more recent data for texas but I cant find it right now.

http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-pol-ca-california-voting-history/

another denial of reality, you think that just because im sick of the catering to immigrants and white replacement, that the west (which whites built) Hasnt been the best place in the world to be a minority? youre a fucking idiot and dont live on planet earth.




Can't disagree with thatI did message YOU publicly and don't care about discussing anything with you privately. I just was curious as to why.

Back up lol? Why would there be back up here? Why are you still on her discord? It was one post and that was just to let people know what your perspective was. 

Yes, I stand by that. From I heard, you were being autistic. 

That's the nature of most discords, subreddits, etc. Also, looks like no one replied to the post, so it seems you're not as important to care about. lol youre so retarded. The argument against the italians was never invalid. I DID address the "natives vs **1st generation** crime stats. Love how you just lie and say I ignored it LOL. Yea MS-13 isnt a result of the children of immigrants, no way. And the only reason immigrants committ less crime than natives on average is because the second generation isnt included, and blacks committ a ridiculous amount of crime.

If you really think there are NO consequences to mass migration, youre just an dumb absolutist. "open boarders and globalism good, countries for white people is evil and bad.

everything else you wrote is just complete bullshit. youre a dumbass.

not wanting to give my country away makes me a pussy? Im not afraid of them, you dumb pieces of shit alway think we are afraid of everything we dont want to happen. We arent afraid of them, we just dont want them to become the majority. There is difference between being afraid of something and just not wanting it. If I dont like speaking spanish or eating mexican food, does that mean im afraid of speaking spanish and burritos? No you retard. And yes, fuck foreigners, being able to live in the U.S is not a right everyone in mexico is granted just because they vote democrat. 

Are you even employed? I bet youre still in highschoolOur education system needs serious reform. There is no way that a smooth brained woman like this should ever be able to become a teacher. 

10 mins in she said a study conducted by a 14 yr old student about race and IQ is "science". UnrealI think there is a big difference. When Destiny is debating people, he usually tries to do his best to engage with the best possible interpretation of their ideas. When it comes to calling a random chatter out, it's usually a short "link or IP ban", or "fuck off retard", after which he moves on.  Sometimes there is a bit of back and forth, but I still feel he's way more laid back and doesn't actively strive to ridicule people, unless they manage to more or less do it for him.  I don't ever remember Destiny dedicating a large amount of time antagonizing a viewer to the same extent to which BadBunny does.its funny how gullible you and PoC are. "republicans are pro white therefore they are racist and hate you! vote hillary!"You should crosspost on OfflineTvWonder why it's unlisted.Is that the guy who thought women should be able to vote?Do you think if we bred dogs for food it would be different?I didn't know Kaitlyn, who is best girl, is back on!

It's enough to make me use the word "ownage", and I hate that meme in political discussion&gt;why did you delete this thread u/YeeBOI123 you cuck?

Destiny or some other mod deleted it. If anyone wants to read what I said I've reposted it [here.](https://www.reddit.com/user/YeeBOI123/comments/82bglp/since_destiny_deleted_it_a_serious_conversation/)&gt; Nah, you didn't. You think you did, but you didn't address the counter argument, the argument that actual researchers make that the reason 2nd generation kids commit crime is because of them ADOPTING AMERICAN CULTURE...and not the other way around

They are adopting black culture (but its ok because they vote democrat). Why do we need to let them in at all? even if they werent a huge burdan and ruining democracy? Give me one good reason why we need to flood our country with mexicans.

&gt;Once again. White people have countries. Stop saying that they don't. Plenty in Europe are 90% white, 95% white. Stop fucking whining about "WHITE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE COUNTRIES!" bro, you're so stupid bro.

Ok so white people in south Africa deserve to live there and bring all their cousins because blacks have other black countries? America has to be given to Mexico because we were only 90% white? Does that really make sense in your brainwashed mind?

I gave you more reasons than them being dumber and more violent on average, which is true wheather you will admit it or not. It costs a ton of money to immigrate them here and they are destroying the integrity of our democracy. Theyre literally just changing the demographics until they win, but youre on that side so of course you dont give a shit.

&gt;You know in the battle of ideas, your ideas fucking suck, your alt-right ideas are thrown from history time and time again

Except througout history the vast majority of countries were homogeneous and didnt displace their citizens. Most countries still dont do that, look at Asia. Look at Japan. Are their "xenophibic alt-right, race realist" views just so outdated? Having a country for your people and not to babysit foreigners is just so racist man! I never blamed all my issues on another group. Im placing blame where blame is due. There are some problems caused by all this and pointing them and deciding enough is enough isnt "scape goating" or "fascist". Oh but I called them a mean word, I guess you got me!


Im not pissed about any of this, im actually facinated how someone like you can just deny reality and adding a point to see if I can get you to concede on the most basic of facts isnt anger. Its hard for me to comprehend how someone can believe anyone who doesnt agree with open boarders is just a dumb redneck nazi. And its republicans fault immigrants all vote democrat, and not jsut a result of democrats giving them shit and promising to let them bring their cousins.. Anyone who wants to keep a country for the original nationality that lives there is just so ridiculous to you!(As long as its a white country, dont mind all the non white countries who keep their national identity).


They are dumber and more violent on average. There is TONS of evidence of it, just like whites are dumber and more violent than asians on average. Boohoo! Not every race is the same! Youre so brainwashed its unbelievable.

Its not hard to be "holyer" than a group who floods the countries with immigrants to replaces us and for us to babysit all for some votes. Maybe we act better than you, because we actually are. You people are brainwashed. Cant even acknowledge basic realities. Democrats will take control because of non whites. A quick look at any voting data would tell you that but I know you dont like facts or reality.




What's your opinion on this article? ~~Discuss~~ debate! Guest: I care about problem A

Destiny: But I think problem B is a lot greater than problem A.

Guest: Don't underestimate problem A, it's really no joke.

Destiny: Can you give me *one* example of problem A affecting things?

Guest: Yeah, here is this one recent prominent example.

Destiny: But that's just one incident. That is so much smaller then problem B.whats the best way to refute a news article that's been well researched and heavily edited by like 10 people??? i know, a random fucking youtube video, big brain btwi'm legit surprised you're a zizek fan, have you seen his Cathy Newman interview?On the other hand, his strange habit of praising dictators could simply come down to him actually meeting with other people and just making up who it was. I wouldn't want to mock their anger, but their hypocrisy.

The anger is justified in my opinion and should be applied to the abuse of other species as wellThe ethical child porn forum yikes at a sexual jokeyou're an idiotSo what triggered this autist that he went on a posting spree like that?That is just a category error. I very much agree with the ethics of giving pedophiles access to child porn.

I'm arguing emotions, not ethics. The idea of some adult masturbating to child porn his doctor gave them is creeping me out more than a joke on the internet. I believe being intentionally and self-awarely creepy was exactly the point of the tweet.maybe you just watch too many shows and movie and now you have a fucked imagination of what an average person actually looks like?Can you give an example my dude. :)gee thanks you really solved the puzzle there How does that mean she hates him? 

She just brought that up because of Fed being afraid of getting banned.&gt; Are they adopting black culture? What is black culture? Most people that mention black culture have no idea what it is.

really dude. Everyone know what the fuck black culture is. They even take pride in not trying, because they make fun of any black person who tries in life as being "too white" or "uncle tom". We know what black culture is. Its rap, single motherhood, gangs, smoking weed, and blaming white people for not having fathers. If they are is just as intelligent as us, then it must be their culture that leads them to have ridiculously  higher rates of homicide and rape. Or is it white people fault they rape more than any other demographic in the U.S.

You say Im strawmanning? I never said that there arent any white countries left. There are a couple that arent giving into the gay globalist new world order like yourself. So because there are white countries, we have to flood the country with mexicans? Makes sense. How about not flooding the country with anyone? Or have more diversity in our immigrants and take a couple from Europe? Maybe because you cant weaponize whites against whites as easily dont you think?

Yea Ill admit to being racist because racist now just means not ignoring the scientifically proven differences between races. They have done tons os studies. If you believe in evolution how the fuck do you think we could evolve in differemnt climates, evolve different anatomical structure, but we all just have the exact same frequency of gene expressions when it comes to cognitive abilities? This is all been proven and they have accounted for environment with twin studies. Read the bell curve. Or just look at crime and test results of races at all income levels

Its not just "all low income people are dumber and commit more crime on average". It is true, but there is still a huge gap between the races at all income levels. You dont know what the fuck youre talking about.

LOL you name TWO WHOLE NATIONS in history that werent homogeneous. Man that sure proves that the vast majority of societies weren't homologous! We always had global diversity! Just look at these two examples!


Yea im sure when China becomes number one Japan will immediately start mass migration of third worlders into their country. Japan has already said that even though immigrants would benefit them economically, they wont do it because they actually have values more important than cheap bullshit. They said immigration would lead to the country only being Japan in name, not nation or identity.

Yea the GOP used to have PoC votes, but that was also when democrats where much stricter on immigration. Now that democrats have promised to bring their family into the country at ridiculous rates, of course they will vote for them. That is a very weak point.you bring up a point that I’ve been reading on that I didn’t include in my original post. the whole thing about companion animals vs farm animals and how they’re completely different(I made the dog = sushi comparison because they are both meat)during the good ole experimental days of adult swimthanks for enlightening me that not all black people listen to rap. Please tell me the positive aspects of black culture that second generation immigrants. I cant wait for your answer.

Its not 1% percent of the black population committing these gang homicides because if that were true they would have killed each other off by now. I dont even know why im arguing with you again about basic facts of reality. If you look at white homicide rates its the same as all other homogeneous white societies. 

Honestly this is all irelevant. We cant do anything about blacks because they have been here since the inception of the country. But we dont need to mass migrate third worlders who just fill our prisons and drain us of our public funding. Even if they didnt committ crime we dont need to give up our society just to pat ourselves on the back and say "boy arent we progressive!".

Of course whites can fight. But usually its not over race. However, its almost impossible for multicultural society to EVER result in unity and conflict free. Its not that whites cant fight with each other, its just less likely than importing a bunch of non whites and telling them propaganda to cause conflict. Whites are the only ones who "vote against their own self interest". Because they hold their principles higher than their desire for more money. They would rather be poor than take money from his neighbor. This is an american value that foreigners do not have. Individualism is a white ideology. There is strong evidence that a large part of ones political ideology come from their genetics, even things like individualism and altruism.

But I dont know why I am still giving you reasons because you still havent given a good reason for why we need to immigrate SO many. Even if they didnt come with a massive amount of consequences. Why do we need to replace ourselves? So we can have cheap bullshit? 

&gt; named two of the most successful and prosperous nations of all time. You haven't named any.

I actually did name one, which is Japan. But literally every country and nation started out as homogonoues. Just because some massive empires had a little bit of multiculturalism, doesnt mean its the norm. Im not going to list off every nation that wasnt multicultural. Its actually the opposite, we did not evolve to be multicultural. It really only causes problems and the only benefit is "muh taco trucks". "Success" is subjective and I dont think a country needs to meet your 
 modern standards in order to justify putting its own citizens first. 

Hey man, India has a plumbing problem, its a crappy country. I guess they need to mass migrate some diversity in there! That will solve the problem!

Oh look michigan is doing pretty good, lets import a bunch of somalians! 

Which one is it, do you need to be successful to justify not being diverse, or are successful places obligated to diversify? Youre not making any sense.

Oh Japan wants to go from 2% non japanese to 3%? I'm sure theyre importing tons of third worlders and giving them as many rights as the U.S does for their citizens. Oh woops! They dont even let non Japanese vote in local elections. 

I even said earlier that the mexicans wouldnt be as much of an issue if they werent allowed to vote for more gibs, immigration and other bullshit. Its basically a foreign influence on our elections and policies. 

No politician in Japan is going to cater to foreigners. None. That is not the case in the U.S. And youre probably ok with that because youre a cuck. I hate saying that word but you are actually a cuck.


Oh humans havent been around very long!... Wait, why did they evolve different physical traits? Thats way to fast to have any noticable differences! Could it be, genes are expressed in differently between populations? Is it possible there skins and bone structure evolved to be different, but their behavior and cognitive abilities stayed exactly the same? hmmm, really gets my noggin joggin.



&gt; Fascism knows no bounds, if you got rid of all the brown shitskins as you call them you'd be turning on other white people. I know this with 100% certainty.

Oh dang I didnt know the only thing stopping white people from genocide each other is this diversity! We need to open our borders! Non whites have never done anything wrong, ever!

.....being this stupid....
 
Name sometghing about black culture that is good for the nation if immigrants start doing it too.... You say "oh you racists cant find anything good about black culture"... yea well why dont you tell me how immigrants assimulating into black culture is in any way a benefit.

Blacks do committ more crime, but even if they didnt, over 70% come from single parent households, thats a LOT of government assistance, and im pretty sure like 35% of hispanics are also from single parent house holds, while whites are like 18-20%.


&gt;You named a country that depends on the USA for its military might and you are arguing that the USA should be MORE like that country...

You really dont see how logically retarded it is to think that if we act like japan in immigration that we suddenly will have all the same problems as them? Our military would be just fine without immigrants. They are a very small percentage of our defense.

It doesnt matter if japan decides to take a couple immigrants, or if people dont want to go there. They are a homogonous society that is very successful. It being not perfect does not mean multiculturalism isnt a good thing. Your logic is very retarded.





&gt;However, its almost impossible for multicultural society to EVER result in unity and conflict free.

I meant conflict between races, and a country that doesnt mass migrate immigrants doesnt have to worry about a political party changing the demographics to achieve the outcome they desire against the will of the people.

&gt; It's 100% against the constitution to deny a citizen their voting rights. Are you even for American ideals bro?

The constitutiong literally says that the country was to be for those of European decent. The immigration policy of the time reflected that as well. Mass migration of mexicans and DACA are WAAAY more unconstitutional. You dont know what youre talking about.


Maybe multiculturalism works sometimes, but that doesnt mean we have to flood the country with mexicans until we have a one party system and have replaced the original European genes that made the country.


Dude the differences in bodies between races is COMMON KNOWLEDGE. Blacks have denser bones making them more negative buoyant which is why they are worse at swimming. They also have a lot of genes that make them more athletic and taller than most other races. Asians are smaller on avergage but are better at spacial reasoning and overall higher IQ. Ashkenazi jews have very high verbal speech intelligence. These are just some examples. Bodies are obviously different. The brain is part of the body.


All of these things are why im NOT A WHITE SUPREMACIST.

Im just against REPLACING AN ENTIRE NATION WITH FOREIGNERS FOR VOTES YOU FUCKING EVIL FAGGOT.


Whites are individualsists in that they dont see themselves as a group, (a lot of them atleast). Everyone else will group up and take advantage of their altruism. Its literally been shown in simulators that this will result in the altruistic group being destroyed. And its happening.


I fucking knew you werent white. Non whites cant handle the reality that we make the best countries, and that you fuckers feel entitled to live with us so you can mooch. Its why you faggots complain about both white flight AND gentrification. You need just enough white people to employ you and pay for your gibs, but youre so pro immigration you shouldnt mind "gentrification". Oh or do you not think its fair when YOUR community is taken over by another group? You havent given me a good reason why we need to flood the country with non whites. Is there anything wrong with a couple thousand immigrants? Not really. But how can you justify replacement levels of immigration? Youre just an evil or jealous person who will justify anything that puts your party in power. Or just a brainwashed cuck who uses "tactical nhilism" and logical retardation, and denial of reality to win a debate with the cuckiest position ever. You basically are for open boarders from what you have argued which is probably more extreme than just wanting a less massive change in demographics.

And im not going to waste my time finding sources for common knowledge, just use google.As an athiest, it pains me to see that you shitters are failing horribly at characterizing his actual arguments. I guess strawmanning is fine if we're dealing with le stupid chrisatians xDDD.Would Destiny even be allowed to do streams on YouTube?I’m not surprised at all. I want to know if I’m missing something. Was hoping to get some people to disagree with me.That's what I thought as well.Dude literally got this for a bizarre sense of humor and not taking the pussy corporate PR route. Thank the lord for the greatest member we have ever seen, I wish him the best. Are they bending the knee, or have they won? They now have nuclear weapons and are planning on keeping them. This means that they are able to ward off take-overs by hostile nations such as the US. Not only this, but they are now being allowed onto the world stage as a proper nation. They no longer have to pretend to be unpredictable lunatics to avoid being trodden over by the good guys. Not only this, but Trump is agreeing to meet with them, as they have requested in the past.  
What has changed diplomatically is the fact that they now have a means to ward off other nations who want to infringe on them (cough cough). Remember when Trump was going to make sure that NK wouldn’t develop nukes in the first place? Now his base is acting ecstatic at the mere notion of Trump meeting with KJU.A Ponzi scheme requires a victim. No one lost money. Completely political to create public trust in the system. What I see was an inexperienced kid (20s) make a mistake that didn’t impact anyoneYeah he “looted” his own company to make sure none of his victims lost money? What kind of logic is that?Look man if you wanna compile any evidence that goes against what I said feel free to send that to me. I’m always open to changing my mind and developing my position. Ok man, stay angry lmao. (And yes I know what fiduciary duty is, no need to be condescending).My point is we’re not gonna make any progress arguing over reddit comments, and if you felt compelled to you were welcome to flesh out your arguments to me on a better platform.thank you for this thread, this perfectly describes my friend who calls himself a "classical liberal" but is very determined that were gonna see some messy truths in the near future about race and IQ and all those good genetic memes.Lmao I can’t do reddit  battles, clearly you guys just don’t like me or Martin Case and point. You just want to intellectually dominate to make yourself feel good, a tell tale sign of someone uninterested in truth. I guess this is what Aragorn felt like in LOTR return of the king. LULI asked for a compilation of fleshed arguments. Obviously there is a mountain of evidence, the interpretation of such evidence is what counts buddy. And that’s what I wanted. Probably not anymore because dealing with neofags is disillusioningIs Blunty King one of us? I really like that guy he memes well on twitterI think ethan has been slowly going down the “anti-sjw” rabbit hole for a while nowWhat are his shitty views? I honestly only know him for his atheist stuff. im saying that he’s been going down this hole for a while now. he’s made some other pretty cringey videos recently ever sense he did that whole “Humongous” meme against the apex sjw herself, Zarna Joshi.  lmao, did you watch the full video. He addresses this very exact thing. He said people that called out twitter for censored Spencer would be totally fine with Spencer censoring the media. Maybe try to finish the video before you comment?
you refuse to answer the questions that prove youre just deflecting. You wont take a stance on why we need so many or how many we should have. Everyone knows races are biologically different, why the fuck do you think we have different tolerances to diseases. There are  a million examples. But in the end, it doesnt matter, becuase we dont need to prove anything to justify our existence. White Americans and their culture have a right to their land and are not obligated to give it to third worlders. And no amount of denial can hide the fact that you literally just want us out of power in our own country and will replace us in order to do so.


Yea, the US is successful because of multiculturalism. Not like its most proporous times where before all this diveristy bullshit. The 50's and 60's were not diverse at all.

The constitution did say the country was for the settlers decendants. thats a fact.


It is not like saying white culture is slave culture because that was hundreds od years ago and  only 1% of white americans had slave and that was hundreds of years ago. Lets not forget every race on the planet has had slaves and some still do. definition of a False equivelancy

but when 13% of the population has so much gang activity that its responsible for 52% of the homicides, We cant do anything about blacks, but we dont have to bring cartel into our country. Its not a human right to be able to live in America, doesnt matter weather you committ crime or not.

You jump all over the place, deny reality, deflect, and use tactical nhilism. Never take up a single stance other than "races are all the same, open our boards because I literally dont care about anything except making sure white people know that the race of my wife's boyfriend is better than them and the world has a right to take their country from them" apparently.Honestly, I'd rather him go on Deep Fried Fat to talk with TJ. The only point of going on the DP is if it's to debate someone.while its hard to write any show, this can't be used for game of thrones. D&amp;D and all the writers have made horrible decisions time and time again ever since the first season and any plot they added or removed to the show from the books was always half-assed and aimed at mass appeal. Not to mention they knew how the books would end since GRRM told them as much yet they still failed to articulate that in any sense on the tv screen. Not to mention that the entire series should have been longer than 10 episodes and 9 seasons so far. Imo season 1 is the closest you get too the books and every following season is getting exponentially worse as more bs was added and good sub plot taken out.

if you're a fan of GoT i would highly recommend you read the books, even though they are long they are very easy to read &gt; I think it should be important to differentiate between Globalism

Globalization? No clue why that got rebranded by the Alt-Right. They love everything about globalization whether they admit it or not, other than the freedom of movement which allows non-Aryans to steal their wives and jobs.maybe because you don’f follow his content that much???Idk people bitch about SFV a lot on Kappa, but I think it's still the number one fighting game if only the fact it's street fighter. I think DBFZ is gonna fall off hard once the casual fans stop playing. I feel like the FGC as a whole is in a good spot, I try to play as many games as I can to just support it.https://i.imgur.com/Br00TCn.gifAnd stay out.&gt; Well, I'm just quoting them, I have no idea if it's possible. I thought it was pretty obvious that it wouldn't be an instant 90/10, but immigration policies that would gradually work towards a 90/10 ratio by limiting immigration to whites only.

Rate of birth of non-whites is greater than whites, so i don't see this happening unless you start shooting non-whites or forcing non-whites to get sterilized. Some idiots call this "white genocide". They all know what they're advocating for and Spencers "non-violence" is just a front.Lmao that boat action was the most vile thing I have seen any sceptic actually *do*. She doesn't value non-white life at all. This level of dehumanization is beyond shocking.Wait, Peterson claims Nazi Germany was socialist? Wait, what exactly do you think should be done with refugees that enter a country via boat? And what do you mean by "illegaly"? Are you familiar with European Asylum law?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_in_the_European_UnionOK. That would have been indefensible else.Is this a one off thing or is destiny going to play sc2 regularly?I literally do not get these people, she is such a cunt to everyone then just like the left of them cries that they are treated unfairly.Yeah I seriously cannot stand these people. Antman is so pathetic.LUL, he needs so much words to explain things.Some dude he talked to in his Westworld adventure looked like Bunty.I'm a Phil fan (was Patron up till recently) but goddamn I feel like he really needed to do more research on that one

Between this and the way he brought up Dave Rubin the other day I'm troubled at his ability to assess people's viewshttp://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/privatization-in-central-and-eastern-europe

http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/cubas-economyCaucasians aren't their own racial category either, as "race" is not a scientific concept. 

&gt;I don't love animals, but I recognize that their suffering matters, regardless of how I feel.

Do you think their lives matter? If not, why would their suffering matter? I.e. why would it be okay to kill and eat an animal versus putting it through tests in a laboratory?

&gt;Why? nuance is important, so obviously a yes or no answer is insufficient. If it can be successfully argued that the benefits of a given study outweighs the animal suffering, then yes. If not, then no. Thankfully we have ethics boards that decide these things now.

Currently, I'm more so interested in the arguments in the first part of this comment. After more conversation, maybe I'd want to think about more nuanced positions.What do you mean by "trait present in rats?" Do you mean correlations between the rat and human biology that would help develop medicine for humans after testing in rats?I've thought about it boiling down to utilitarianism, but like I said, I would like to put my thoughts to task. 

I'm not interested in the more nuanced in-between positions right now (reasons stated in an earlier comment). You're begging the question "is it cruel to test animals?" This is what I'm interested in at the moment.  
It'd probably be best to talk with an ethical vegan about this because of how you would have to think using your fundamental beliefs. I can consider possible arguments on the opposing side, but that doesn't always give me a strong argument of my own. Kind of like trying to play chess with yourself.Just want to tell you about a few inconsistencies.

When you talk about requirement, I don't think you're being fair. We're not required to test on animals to better humans in any way. We could very well sacrifice the utility to treat animals better. Sure, the benefits of medicine are very dramatic, but it's still not a necessity which it sounds like you're making it out to be. Just food for thought.

Also, you say that you "apply the same for animals," and then include that you "don't care for their consent." It seems quite clear just from this that they are not the same standards. I don't think you should rationalize animal testing with the basis that you're okay with human testing, plus the caveat that it's consensual. That's a big difference and takes away the from the validity of that justification.  
In case I'm being unclear, it's like saying that you are okay with stealing food from bears because you are okay with stealing food from humans, as long as the human doesn't care about the food.1. Do you care about animals?

2. If so, talking about your original comment, why?Just giving you some food for thought.

Some people believe that animals are entitled to the same considerations as humans. So they would not believe in prioritization of humans over animals, but see all as equal. This is the foundation I want converse with.Did you really ask him to debate Destiny? xDDid you call into the Majority Report?That's a pretty dirty way of refusing to address his argument.

He argued that the probability of a universe with starting conditions that could give rise to a future universe with any form of particle interactions (and in turn, life), were so small that some sort of intelligent design becomes more plausible. Whether or not similar questions could be turned against him about god, how do you actually address it?The food metaphor was to explain the incoherence of relating animal testing to human testing only if humans consent.It's pretty bigoted to call their beliefs retarded. If someone did hold these beliefs, they wouldn't do any of the things you just mentioned. You're expressing your hatred of hypocrites and extending it to consistent people.Do you distinguish between animals, i.e. do ants have the same considerations?In your original comment you said that you're okay with animal testing and justified by saying that you're also okay with human testing only if it is consensual. Animal testing is not consensual, so this doesn't add up.  If someone was born in a society that benefited from such things, that doesn't make them hypocritical for disagreeing with it later on in life.I know he wants to win but he's been playing a lot of starcraft. Here's hoping this renews his interest in it. I don’t need to link you shit. go look for yourself, dude. lolWe all know that money comes first for him, which is fair enough, and he wanted to move to a more profitable game hoping he could become a big league streamer. That said he hasn't really made it as a league streamer so hopefully this viewership shows him he can move back to sc2 and do just as well. She definitely will have to go back and do them all again, it will just be infinitely easier to do when she isn't trying to get any achievements other than simply beating the main quests. Shroud seriously is one of my favorite streamers on Twitch.Decent video. Andy seems very much like the guy who wants to fit in with the other guys. He'll go to any length to get along well with his new found friends. I don't really care who Andy platforms, I just think he's retarded and has no idea how he's being used by the alt-right.&gt;Wouldn’t any decent person wish for a world without guns? In my view, only someone who doesn’t understand violence could wish for such a world. A world without guns is one in which the most aggressive men can do more or less anything they want. It is a world in which a man with a knife can rape and murder a woman in the presence of a dozen witnesses, and none will find the courage to intervene.

Nani?

&gt;Of course, owning a gun is not a responsibility that everyone should assume. Most guns kept in the home will never be used for self-defense. They are, in fact, more likely to be used by an unstable person to threaten family members or to commit suicide. However, it seems to me that there is nothing irrational about judging oneself to be psychologically stable and fully committed to the safe handling and ethical use of firearms

&gt;—if, indeed, one is.

Here is my whole thing. I don't think most people really possess the mental stability of owning a gun. Literally every person I have known who has a gun "just in case" always threaten to use said "just in case" guns for non self-defense, often domestic uses. 



It's only hypocritical if the person cares about the cat for a reason that would also apply to a chicken.

For example the moral axiom 'killing mammals is wrong' is violated by killing a cat, but not by killing a chicken. The 'mammal rights activist' wouldn't be a hypocriteno way, dude. I don't believe in objective morals. Just saying, to be a hypocrite you need to violate your *own* moral position.No problem.

Well if we started from some axiomatic moral ground we could try to explore the killing of different classes of life in an objective way. But I myself don't use products that involve the direct killing of animals, so if there are any good justifications out there, then they haven't reached me yethate to do this, but can someone explain Jeb! memeNo one's allowed to criticize other countries because Americans elected a shifty president? WTF is wrong with your brain? Bombing his mom's basement seems more accurate and less fair to his mom. Alt Hype is a retard.That's what I was thinking, like damn he's let himself go.HahahahahaYeah if Metokur doesn't rip into him for this, I'm going to be hugely disappointed.IT IS CALLED LUV YOU EEDIOTIdk where that picture comes from but it seems really ridiculous to me that it posits a "level" of sentience. This gets into topics I didn't want to discuss (how to define sentience, are plants sentient).Don't make this emotional. Would you rather your dad live instead of harvesting him for organs to save your friends?  
You're making an emotional appeal based off of your own values. He's essentially saying that he views all animals as equal in terms of moral consideration. Of course he would say yes to your question because for him, it would be the same as asking "would you rather your friend die than sacrifice your mother for medicinal tests?""Testing as a whole" means nothing here. I'm okay with sex as a whole, but I'm not okay with rape. You're conflating separate topics.  
It's human testing vs animal testing. They are not the same. Don't tell me that animals can't consent; you're being incredibly dishonest if you think a rat would willingly kill itself for any reason. I have a few problems with this.  
You say that you're an "incrementalist," but this is very immoral if I understand your values (you're a vegan?). You're essentially saying that an immoral action is okay for the time being; the reason is irrelevant. What if we never find another field? Would it be completely okay then?  
Also, when you say "divorce myself" from actions relating to these topics, it's just weaseling yourself out of judgement by saying that it's too hard. Yeah, being morally consistent is difficult, but if you fail because it's difficult that doesn't make it okay.  
I'm a little confused on your values. You're okay with killing animals if it's for some arbitrary amount of benefit to humans. If you think that "saving lives" is what distinguishes flu shots and animal skin, you're basically saying that you're willing to be ___ amount morally consistent until you have to die for it. 

I might have misunderstood your beliefs, but if not, I think you said a few common controversial "safe" opinions.Andy's response should be delicious.If you don't care in general, why engage in this kind of discussion? Unless I'm misunderstanding, it sounds like you don't care about living a morally consistent life (WHICH IS OKAY), but it seems like you're also trying to justify yourself a bit. There's a lot of problems with "evolved to live with us and be our companions," but if you don't care, I think you shouldn't think that at all. Why try to justify your sympathy towards dogs if you don't care? It comes off as half-assing caring about being scrupulous and indifferent at the same time.Not everyone sees humans to be more worthy of consideration as animals. This is what I'm interested in, not your "war against nature."&gt; If someone says or thinks something retarded, I'll call it just that. If they didn't want people to call their opinions retarded, theya shouldn't hold retarded opinions.

If you think something is retarded, it is retarded. It's your opinion that you don't back up at all. "You're retarded, not my fault you think like this." Is this really how your thought process goes?Congrats Destiny!!Yeah, apparently he's going to walk down the street with speakers that read text to speech donations or some shit?What a lunatic.Three comments, only two show up. Someone who commented in this thread is shadowbanned and it's not ctrl_alt-ARGH or fishdancing.I think so.probably because it included a clause that says: dont tell the exact appearance feeYeah that's true. I saw him tweeting to people that if they keep complaining for him to do it, he's just going to do the opposite. Said he "won't be manipulated". Kinda sounds like he's manipulating himself though if he's going to refuse to do a video he'd do about anyone else, based on people bitching at him.I wonder if Andy would do well in jail, he has all that babysitter experience.It's broken down into 8 episodes that are roughly 30 mins long. If you pay for a subscription you will get an extra 30 mins of contents per episode but i don't think its necessary for the main story. I found it to be very interesting and entertaining and something easy to listen to while playing league or doing some other random shit. Also Duckerz at the host's last name.Not propaganda btw PEPEWhen you have to force empathy it's not real empathy, sounds like you're autistic bud.&gt;league

downvotedCouldn't have said it better myself. Now, the sooner we all realize this the sooner we can all move out to Athene's compound and C L I C C.Oh dear. At least he's not pretending anymore I guess.we all sin from time to timewhy does amos yee walk like thatlmao why do i feel like enriched is exactly the word Steven would use 

what a nice friendshipIf you are making the point that Jontron follows them ironically to make fun of them, please tell us what you're basing that on. Anything Jontron said in the past which goes on line with that will do. It's true that you can't simply base it on the Twitter follow page. Jontron is following them *and* he has expressed similar views. That's why I believe he follows them – because they've expressed similar views, i.e agree with each other.So Jontron has participated in this circle and had these views for a long time and only apologized when it started hurting his brand, and when Jontron "distanced" himself that merely came down to still consuming their content, but not producing content with them anymore?

I think most people call Jontron racist because of his lack of ethnostate comments. His Twitter follows is just a small part of it compared to that. I don't see *there being* (edit: phrasing) a very strong "benefit of the doubt" argument for Jontron. But you can rest assured that when Jontron gets called racist it's almost only for him doubling down on his ethnostate idea over and over, and it's almost not at all for him follow racists' social media accounts. The most reasonable explanation is that Jontron was convinced by alt-right figures and didn't know enough himself.

Unfortunately he still follow those alt-right figures on social media. So are we back at square one?jup that is because when you enter a shengen country you dont need to show your ID when you cross over a border to anther shengen country. This entails that you need a centralized place to decide which people cannot enter and which people can. the safety is shared Is who he follows indicative of his character though? I don't even know Jontron really, besides his thing with Destiny, but I follow a lot of the same retards he does just because I like to watch them sperg. I don't think that means very much.No they are not the same. Definately not *literally* the same. They are not even close.

I'm not trying to argue with you, this is an intervention. Your opinion is (if you're not trolling) radical and radically stupid. I'm here to make you aware that your opinion makes you and people associated with you look like unhinged lunatics. 

Please get your mind together!Fear leads to hatred. -YodaPretty sure JF hates jews lol. The latest weird video he posted was mumbling something about being genetically distinct from the jews. He's lost his mind.This is probably not anyone's stupid uncle's opinion, but I will try to put the conservative perspective as charitable as possible.

Black people are dealt a bad hand. But they have the power to improve that situation. If there was a cultural shift in the black community - a strong "black responsibility" movement - that focuses on keeping families intact, on reducing crime, on getting education, the black community could push past the discrimination and break the cycle in a few generations.Cameron was the most annoying character of all time.

Chase was so cool, especially when he murdered that patient.The strongest evidence is that he doubled down pretty hard on his ethnostate ideals. The Twitter follow-list is pretty weak in comparison.That is again one of those statements that makes you look really bad. Again, I'm not arguing with you. I'm telling you. You write like someone who is very histrionic and has little comprehension of the world.The screenshot shows his latest follows at the top. The last time he followed someone on Twitter it was those nine accounts in that order.

The reason he is called racist is because he pushed racist ideas in public debate. If he wants to apologize and actively distance himself from a movement – be my guest – but it doesn't help his case if he still follows that movement.If this is your real personality, you NEED HELP!When I say 'black people are dealt a bad hand' I mean what you would call 'white privilege'. I mean that statistically on average if you are born black in the USA you are in a worse situation and you face more negative bias than white people. Basically what you said.

Let me first apologise, I did not know the phrase "black responsibility" had any historical baggage. I wasn't using the word to be provocative.

What I mean is that within their underprivileged situation, which I don't deny, the black community still has potential to improve from within. I got the impression that there is a fatigue, a kind of hopelessness, a distrust in the system, maybe a lack of leadership that is holding the black community back beyond what can be accounted for by white privilege. Correct me, if I got it wrong, of course.I hate making broad assumptions about people as well, but the subtext is pretty clear with JF. It doesn't take an intellectual heavyweight to see that he has some pretty bizarre ideas in his head.He's fucking up bad now. His first story (which is recorded on stream) was that he took the condom off because it didn't fit right. Now he's saying on Twitter that the condom "slipped off". Like damn dude, you lying about this shit is only going to make things worse...You see how he changed the story when he tweeted about it? Now the condom "slipped off", yeah he definitely didn't take it off intentionally, he wouldn't do that.Well you guys could very well be right about him, I wasn't here to defend him. I'm just saying who people "follow" isn't really indicative of shit. I follow people I genuinely enjoy, and I follow people I dislike just for my own amusement. I assume there are plenty of other people that do that as well.Yeah, that one was really good!

But I was thinking of the one where they treat this dictator Dibala and chase fakes a test result on purpose (!) so that Dibala dies.He's about to talk about it on a stream I think. I wonder if he'll try to bullshit his way out of it?Shocking, what a piece of shit. I think if he owned up to it, most people would move on, but him lying about it is just going to dig his grave further.Yeah the pessimistic part of me thinks you're right. But the optimistic part thinks that his nut-huggers will clearly stay with him, but I think people more in the middle will leave if he continues to lie about it and fuck things up left and right. I can see that happening, but you're right, a lot of his sycophants won't be phased by this, I already saw that in the live chat for the stream he tried to do. Didn't work because his audio was fucking up, so I think he's going to do another one later or some shit.Don't think he gives a fuck about the lawsuit. It's mostly the mass flagging and sending the FBI after his ex-wife and son that scares him away from this human garbage.That's not ok.

But can we be sane about the language? The official narrative seems to be that Andy is bragging about it. But I don't hear bragging in the video. Quote "The next day I was like, 'oh my god, what did I do'". That sounds to me like he made a mistake while being drunk, not like he is bragging about it.

Another thing: That is not rape (*edit: in common language*). Stop eroding that word. Nobody takes you seriously. It's really bad for your cause when you tell people "This Warsky guy is bragging about rape," and then somenoe checks the story, and he is not bragging and it is not rape.Haha wtf, is this for real?Is there a VOD?Same with Pewdiepie who seems to get a slide on it, despite his videos really pandering to the alt-right.I'd ask you if you wanna hop in discord and debate meSource: https://voxeu.org/article/overcoming-zero-sum-games-sustain-growth-and-globalisationWas she at least 18?I like Steven. Worse than a thousand holocausts that he plays League. Let's say people read as a paper headline "Warsky braggs about raping a woman". Do you think the common person would immagine the video how it is?

I would say it invokes a much worse picture. That's why I would absolutely identify it as 'battle language'. The rape part is technically true, but I would say misleading, the bragging part is made up and it's not by accident.I didn't understand the argument or the conclusion. But he seems to be sure that Dawkins wants peoples rights taken away based on status? What a strange videowhat's wrong with atheism and skepticism?

And what's wrong with mocking stupid ideas?

What about that is taking anyones rights away based on status?What else? Housing stock? Immigration? Restaurants?Ian seems to be a nut-hugger of literally everybody at different points in time. Wasn't he both an SJW, and a white nationalist before lol? He seems like a pandering cunt.Yeah it's going to be very hard for him to come back from this, at least with anyone outside of the white nationalist circle jerk."So you think we should perpetuate misconceptions?"

You must be aware that kind of "summary" of my statement makes me not want to interact with you. What are you Cathy Newman?I don't believe the new Atheists are trying to silence anyone.

And the religious are not silent at all. They are literally preaching.

It's called a debate. You critizise each others ideas. Summarizing that as one side is silencing the other is incomprehensible to me.

And you think the 'manosphere' has any social capital to speak of? More than women? More than half the human population?

I'm starting to understand why I didn't understand the videofair enough : )That would still be considering it a mistake, so he is still not bragging right? Did you ever hear someone brag about a mistake they made?But isn't like calling people 'being a dick' or calling my speech 'spouting' also in violation of that concept?You're being rude for no reason.

You can do something on purpose, regret it later and call it a mistake. You're wrong.

But let's call it "he did something wrong, but regret it later for selfish reasons". He's still not braggingNow you're just trying to bully me.

Can you define 'bragging' and show how Andy was doing it in the stream?No, I would *hate* that person. He is making light of it. He is entertaining his friends. He is giving weak excuses. It's DISGUSTING.

But I wouldn't call it bragging though. On account of that *he* considers it something he shouldn't have done.Well, thank you for revisiting then. Then I'll watch the video you provided : )And I never said he regrets it for good reason. But he still thought "this was stupid to do". He regretted it for selfish reasons.

And do you think the only reason people tell a story in public is bragging?

He probably thought it was an interesting story. Maybe even funny. Maybe he thought, minimizing his action would score him points with his vile audience. I don't know what he was thinking, I just know what bragging is and I don't see any bragging going on that video. You asked me to read Andy Warskis mind, did you think I would come up with pleasant scenarios?

Fuck me? You call me obtuse? You call me a mistake?

How about you finally adress what I'm patiently and politely telling you? He was not bragging. That word has a meaning. And I'm not seeing that in that stream.What do you think bragging means? Just tell me please.&gt;They are calling you a racist if you don't like that

Who the fuck is openly talking about their racial preferences in porn to each other and who the fuck would judge somebody for that. They just made this shit up on the spot I see

&gt;White men don't like to see white women get fucked by black men

How does she know this? Is she going around and asking her racist buddies. I'm sure they just don't want to see black people on the screen periodAnd I don't think he is boasting. I don't think he is presenting it as something he is proud of. I don't think he is saying it's an achievement.

You're presenting this weird dichotomy that he either said it as bragging or he said it for educational purposes.

When I presented you with other possibilities -like maybe Andy thought it would be a funny story- you just triggered out. So maybe I actually can't get through to you. And the verbal abuse you are willing to throw my way is also not improving this conversation.I wouldn't, you wouldn't. You think ANDY wouldn't?No, that is not my logic at all. People can be bragging, without saying it explicitly.

I'm saying here in this one specific case someone is not bragging, on account of that he is not showing pride, he is stating regret for the action, he is not stating his increased status, he is not stating how much of an achievement it was, how difficult it was or how other people couldn't have done it, he is not stating how good of an action it was.

My logic is, for me to consider something bragging, the action has to show the qualities of bragging. Your logic seems to be 'it is bragging until proven otherwise'.

And you skipped again the important question:

Do you think it is impossible that Andy has told the story because *he* thought it was a funny story to tell - to entertain his friends and audience?But you are misunderstanding my reasoning. I don't know how much more clearly I can spell it out. It is incredible to me, how often you call my intelligence or comprehension into question while misunderstanding me so profoundly.

My previous post spells it out so clearly: I don't think Andy is bragging, because he is not expressing any of the behaviours that I understand as bragging. It's the most straightforward reasoning.

I only brought up "maybe he's joking" because you asked me to!It is very clear that you are not reading my posts. Then I will stop putting up the efford.

For the record, I have put forward, politely and patiently, a very clear, logically sound case for why I believe Andy was not bragging.

I put up with your abuse without retaliating and I tried my best to correctly understand each of your posts.

I believe you to be a histrionic crybully, who is incapable of reasoning, reading comprehension or civil discourse. You are rude, stupid and annoying. I didn't enjoy this at all, and with that I'm done with this conversation.I agree with that. I don't think that changes my point. It's still an expression of regret. Like he did something stupid. What you wouldn't do while bragging.

Andy is vile and disgusting. I just don't think he was bragging in that situation.Ok, I'm willing to agree that he bragging about being so sexually succesfull might be part of what's happening there. But is he bragging about the rape part though?

Just do me a favour, the next time you are arguing with someone, could you tell them upfront that you are a moron?Didn't see that coming. I've been called a rape apologist all day for wanting to argue semantics, so it's refreshing getting some criticism from the right for a change.

That would be a Peterson or Molyneux kind of criticism of Atheism?Thank you! that is a very helpful summaryRed pilled based muslim women are going their own way, on account of being woke afIf you have a desire to be consistent and are willing to change, good for you man!

One thing I want to point out is the seeming difference between "torture" and just killing the animal. If okay with the killing of the animal, it's very hard to defend "proper treatment" of animals as well. You're breeding them for slaughter and consumption, so is "torture" actually something that makes this unacceptable?

As long as you're honest with yourself, you're more honorable than the average person.&gt; unsustainable

I feel that if Andy and JF were really in a relationship, JF would be abusing him the entire time.Don't bother. The guy is an incredible imbecile. He will tangle you up by not understanding your point. Then get very rude. It's really not worth your time.They haven't been smeared by dogs, they have been exposed by journalists.

Sure, there was a leftist lean to it. And uncharitable language used.

 But there was enough substance there that does reflect extremely badly on these mofos.I can't believe someone expressed exactly how I feel without getting down voted. I really like Destiny, but there just is no joy in the stream recently, it can be a combination of things of course, but nobody really likes league and he continues to play it nonstop. 

I can't really knock him for cutting out debates because those alt right guys are really nutso. Anyways it's not just you, he just seems mad, like all the time and it is just toxic at this point. I am sure he is trying to jazz the stream up a little, but it is having the opposite effect and just driving people away.My bad, forgot how that shit worked. Sorry Lily.&gt;And we put in an extra round because you might need to kill 18 people that day

HeheEh look at Destiny's numbers during his Starcraft run. After 60 hours he still hadn't dropped under 4k (to my knowledge). League streams barely get 2k. I understand that it's a different thing and all but his league streams really don't draw all that well.https://www.reddit.com/user/donnagail/posts/

If you look at "Donna's" history it looks frighteningly real. She's asking in the NRA subreddit about car rentals, and then [there's this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/806yth/my_son_is_visiting_baltimore_this_weekend_and/duwkpge/?context=10000)This is great. It really shows how triggered and bitchy JF get's when HES the one getting dogpiled. He was advocating for that shit on Andy's stream, but I guess when it happens to him, it's mean.So they sentenced him for a joke? That's pretty fucked that they can just do that to people. I mean, unless I'm misunderstanding?[Shaun weighs in](https://imgur.com/lpyuEZV)Yes, because banks = schools, glad we cleared that up.President of the United states =  local goverment official.

And Tonka looked so bad. Like I couldn't believe itThis 100% even if it was a "joke" when it's someone who has a largely racist audience this is not a good look. I do think jail time might be a little too much but it certainly sends a message.Dr. MandingoYeah I don't think JF's retarded ass is suing anybody either, and if he does, I'm sure he'll lose like he always has. Besides that, I can see him starting a cult as well. A cult of autistic, ethnostate loving retards.If you can prove gender discrimination, you should be able to sue. That is a good law. That is a lot better than quotas. That is what all those feminists should be doing: find a woman that was discriminated and sue. It's illegal to discriminate.I'm into internet drama stuff. I don't know if you know, but 'internet Blood-sport' fans HATE Sargon and his (british) liberalism, because he is not an ethno-statist basically. That's why I wanted to see this confrontation. Tonka is suprisingly non-confrontational and calm.everybody might *think* that, but not everyobdy can prove it in court, which is a good standardMOBA addiction. Are these the White [supremacy] knights that I've heard about? He's important and well cited because he is considered a pioneer in linguistics, not because of his works related to foreign politics.

For me in a European university, Chomsky was required reading in theoretical philosophy because of that. Along with people like Putnam, Wittgenstein, Frege etc.h-index.

Noam Chomsky has a h-index of 164. Which means he has published at least 164 papers with that were each cited 164 times. Chomksy's h-index is higher than that of Karl Marx, and has been cited 337098 times in total.Its usually survivorship bias "I was able to beat the odds, why doesnt everyone else just be a statistic anomaly :\^)"Neon Genesis EvangelionYa, we all know that the stream had gone to shit but **this subreddit should be 100% original, insightful context!**Ha, your thread got deleted.The anti-alt-right circlejerk here hates him because he's willing to talk to anyone and mostly let whatever they say go unchallenged. But I think it's really valuable to have someone who can have a long, friendly conversation with Neil DeGrasse Tyson one day and then have a long, friendly conversation with Alex fucking Jones the next. He's a nice conduit to get people's views, however insane they might be, out into the open. 

He also spends a lot of time peddling nutrition  supplements and such, but I guess you have to make money somehow when people aren't willing to donate just to hear you say 'nice meme'. I think it's to Destiny's advantage that the first thing you find when you Google him is no longer some retarded Twitter feud about who is or isn't pro-incest. The whites aren't a race, they're a problem.LPT: You don't have to read all of the dialogue.

If he wants to play the pity card I suggest admitting to acting like a collosal fucking retard, otherwise I'll happily continue to ignore anything that comes out of his mouth and/or twitterFuck bernie bros, they have no idea wtf the DNC actually did but claimed it was rigged. dumb fucking cunts all of them. btw im a bernie bro :/This is what i mean about the retardism of the DNC leaks. No one was "chosen" to win, you people have the hardest fucking time separating dirty political tactics to legit rigging of an election. Every single state has a its own process it goes by during the primaries on top of it being either a closed/open caucus/primary. 

Bernie was destined to lose because he never made in grounds to black voters in the south which where strictly hillary voters and very reliable votes, due to here years of work/recognition whereas Bernie was a complete newcomer to them. Not to mention the New York primary was the turning point. the state democrats there are very corrupt and like to keep power for themselves, this is unrelated to clinton since New york states entire history has been a power struggle of the parties. Dems made it so you had to register 6 months prior an election to vote if you were an independent. remember these are primaries and a party, depending on the state can make it so that only members of said party can vote. The 6 month deadline was in october since the primary was in april, just when bernie was barely breaking into the 15-20% in polling.

So to say that the whole thing a was charade and Hillary was destined to win is not only wrong but completely lacking any nuance of the political system or climate. Not to mention no one even talks about how the RNC was legit stealing delegates from trump by rewriting the rules of their primaires/caucuses days before the vote. The only thing i agree with you here is that the DNC clearly hasn't learned all its lessons from the 2016 election.The problem is just that he's so deeply entrenched into that community that if Destiny does interact with him, it will stir up the worst kinds of people.I think this was based on some articles that popped up in places like the Guardian or VICE magazine proposing the idea that Jesus was gay, I think trying to make a point that christians should not discriminate against gays.

The point Lauren is trying to make here is: can you do that with Islam? Turns out, at least in the UK, the police will stop you.

It's really a strange situation. I don't like anything about it. I don't like Lauren's action and I don't like the Muslim's reaction and I don't like how the police handled it.If you do the reddit thread &amp; podcast, I think the two most important things will be to revisit topics frequently for a back-and-forth with your fans, and to address and acknowledge comments or questions that you could not answer or otherwise forced you to change your position.﻿So I'm assuming that she used the best and most dramatic reactions. In her video:

* Other people peacefully speaking their opinion

* The police closing down the booth

It's unfortunate for her if she set out to become the next Lars Vilks. 

I think we really should be doing more to call this out. Then destiny might get a league ban and we can watch him play something else. That's fair enough. But many people, like me included, find it an important principle to protect offensive speech. We wouldn't like to see the police be the enforcer of anyone who's offended by something.

What I would have preferred to see, is the police to keep an eye on the situation, to diffuse it if neccessary, to prevent violence from happening, not to prevent speech from happening.

If that is not possible of course, they have to prioritise keeping people save.Well, thank you :)Yikes how will league viewers defend thisI'm an outsider looking in but I remember feeling like things were in a really good spot around the Fuentes debate - Destiny seemed to be basically crushing debate after debate, and even though the Fuentes discussion went off the rails toward the end there were a lot of moments where I felt like Destiny really demonstrated how silly the opposing argument was. He started making allies also, which, as Destiny has said, isn't really his goal bc he doesn't really have a specific political agenda but I somehow feel like having allies is a good step towards facilitating further good debates.

Once the JF/Warski memes started I felt like things really went in a bad direction - I personally don't even consider them debates and half of them I haven't even fully watched. People like Lauren Southern or Nick Fuentes at least seemed somewhat focused on *winning the debate*. This crowd seems more focused *defeating the opponent*, which is a set of people on whom things like the 40-40-20 rule doesn't appear to work because their audience doesn't  seem to care about the conclusion even a little. Destiny tangled with bigger names than that crowd many times before and I don't feel like I remember hearing about mass-reporting/FBI shit until recently. I don't have a solution here or anything, I just wanted to say fuck that specific group. I'll take 30 Nick Fuentes before them.Wait, is zis not an official court of ze law? I have been mizled.

Yours Truly,  
J.-François Gariépyo______________________________________oSo he cherry picks examples that have a plausible explanation(i.e. black people tend to play basketball more and Japanese people tend to focus more on achieving academically) and immediately point to "muh genetics". I don't think these people read shitIf we can't blame people for the behaviour by their fans then what is the point of this subreddit? That is very much not how the law works. People are convicted of *specific crimes*, not just generally being bad people. No. The character of the accused can go to the reliability of his testimony, but not the likelihood that he committed the offence. You can't argue, for example, that because someone committed previous robberies they likely committed the one in question. Fuck off. Um, the meaning of my comment was that we shouldn't judge people by their internet fans, not that we should get pedantic about the relatively numbers. But I'll bite: what the fuck do you mean by JBP "radicalizing" his fans? His biggest sin is talking to people you disagree with on his talk show. Wow.I figured this would happen sooner or later. I doubt Warski will be with him much longer, he should probably get back with the asian guy that kept him in line LOLWhat the most funny thing about all of this is. Not one of the Free Speech fighters not one is defending Britain first I'm sure there's a legitimate argument to be made for making children better prepared for the hellscape that is the US school system, but "learn CPR and stop complaining" is probably not the way to do it. He's also a known puppy molester and personally responsible for 3/5 school shootings. So sad that someone would promote him here. Rick Santorum is the same person that falsely claimed Dutch people were euthanising the elderly against their will. ]One thing that I would like to see is some kind of interaction with this subreddit like he did for the Monday Mail series, when he took the most upvoted questions. I feel like it would help drive people from his YouTube (which is one place I assume he’s post the podcast) deeper into his community.Is the quote not about atheists? Most of the leading Bolsheviks were not Jews, and many, like Stalin and Beria, were not ethnic Russians. Is this actually a "famous antisemitic quote" or just being read that way here? Based on that thread, there is nothing to be gained from talking to that person.OK, do you have any reason for saying this? The consensus on Solzhenitsyn by the people who knew him, including his Jewish wife, is that he was [not an anti-semite](https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/13/books/solzhenitsyn-and-anti-semitism-a-new-debate.html). Are you actually aware of any of the background behind this quote, or just banking on the D.GG groupthink? Thanks for the explanation! It just struck me as something Solzhenitsyn wouldn't have said unless he meant it in a completely different way, but I honestly didn't know. Hey guys, just popping round to the shops, has anyone seen my burka? Don't want the sharia police to see me and know that I am a kafir. seems like the only practical way to go about it, from local to sate to federal.

OMEGALULAh, I see. Giving a comprehensive answer to a question now counts as sidestepping and pandering... I hope you remember this every time Destiny is asked a question and decides to not answer with a simple yes/no.Every country has some degree of socialist policies &amp; programs. Those with a overwhelming number of them are called socialist countries.

Maybe this is confusing since Americans seem to think that any kind of socialism is always 100% full-blown communism.understandable Nice post you beat me too it XD, here is the first episode btw, also a good one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBR_dcp38KAIf Lauren Southern looked that dumb all the time JF would have impregnated her by now. &gt;So, is money similar? Does he have the same opinion about capitalism?

Slavoj Zizek is a self described Hegelian Marxist if that means anything to you, and he's very critical of capitalism. Here's a wiki link if you care to learn some more about him: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavoj_%C5%BDi%C5%BEek

&gt;Also, pretty sure pikachu isn't a rapist but okay.

Wat

&gt;Also, why does he say that this is going to be the future

Personally my knowledge of Zizek's philosophical work is superficial outside of youtube vids and a documentary. First of all everyone is trapped in their own ideology thus making it hard to identify said mechanisms in life let alone escape them. I think a good example of this dystopia is shown in the book "Brave New World" where people are pre-programmed genetically to be content in life. I think Zizek also believes more or less that history is cyclical so the concept of a future would more or less resemble the past. Also in the video Zizek implies the future will be the same as the past, just with a technological face. His quote from the video " I think that *sniff* this is the future, why? Because my point is that; the trick with Pokemon Go is not that it's something new. No! It's preci... it brings out something that was always already here in our ideological life."What the fuck is this retard saying. The border was never open, even under democratic control. No one with any real power is promoting this, if anything the borders have been getting more secure with the help of some democrats. Also, do you know what's more paralyzing to the Trump administration? Trump himself is causing legislation to be more difficult than it needs to be, and the people working for him are jumping ship, because of him. But what annoys me the most is the idea that trump, and the republicans some how care about the deficit.Could you explain how "hypergamy" has something to do with this?Oh right. Sure I agree with that entirely. &gt;There are many times throughout history where we have been, to one degree or another, free from dogmatic entrapment.

I'm not sure if there were times in history free of ideology. I can think of the era of good feelings in early U.S. history but peaceful times themselves don't free individuals from their ideological preferences. Its seems to me that although we are affected externally by ideological messaging, the reason we cling to a certain ideology is because we feel internally that it is true to some degree. Another example would be of a hermit who is apolitical/atheist, even though he is free from external influences he is still trapped with his internal ideology that made him a hermit, like a distrust of society and so on. I hope this made some sense.Time to get myself banned from the sub again:

&gt;People keep screaming "YOU'RE NOT IMPROVING YOU HAVE NO DESIRE TO LEARN THE GAME" which is markedly not true.

Sure you're improving, but considering that you sunk several hundred hours into this game over the last year some of the mistakes you keep making are very frustrating to watch. Even more frustrating is that **you yourself** keep identifying these mistakes, but seemingly don't learn from them. How many times this past week alone did you blow flash/heal to escape a gank only to (correctly) say "why did I use my summs", when you die anyway. How many times did you forget to kite away from the enemy only to (correctly) say "I should have kited back". I don't think most people is chat honestly think that you are at the exact same level as you were a year ago, but you making these same old mistakes practically every other game and the screaming at your teammates for sometimes the most trivial shit is just frustrating to watch, even for someone like me who enjoys watching league streams over Undertale, or even Nier. Part of the appeal of your stream is watching you improve and become better at games. Hearthstone, Nier, Rust, Eve, are all games where you started pretty much from scratch and slowly over the course of days made big and obvious improvements. It just feels like to me that, considering the hours upon hours you invest into league and the ressources avalable to you (didn't the LS guy, or some other coach over free lessons?) you aren't improving at the rate that you should be, if improving was a main concern for you. I understand it's annoying as fuck to read chat and see some people backseat game the fuck out of you, but I also think that at least some of those people want to legitimately see you improve. In the end (at least for me) I enjoy watching league streams and will continue watching, but I will also continue turning off stream once you get into you frustrated banhammer phase, because watching you tell chat how retarded they are and sit in silence for the next hour isn't quite as enjoyable.and to think this all happened because people wanted to watch hell's kitchen instead of the Wire PEPE&gt; no moober streams 1 hour before the stream starts

He would need a schedule for that and, spoilers, that doesn't end well, never did.

&gt;no movie related comments while he is streaming.

Would be cancer to enforce since some people aren't aware he's streaming and would get banned and then complain, rinse and repeat.

I think the way going forward is to implement chatrooms. This would basically get rid of most of his complaints about movie chat and keep people that want those happy. Not as easy to implement though, so probably gonna be a while before we have that.Harris has been doing dumb shit recently, but not to the extent that the full-retard circlejerk of Chapo should be feeling superior to him.I'd really hope Destiny isn't finished with debating and conversations, even if he avoids the heavy subjects. That's how I found him originally, I loved those.You don't purge communists. They purge you. I'd disagree. I believe /u/Applepie_svk was trying to point out the absurdity of what she was saying and showing how rude it is to use the taqiya defense. It looks like a lot of people took what Applepie said literally and downvoted.A lot of other religious people and non-religious people do this. Even in the bible.

nah but he's a lil too charitable to people like Dave Rubin and buys into the marketplace of ideas meme too much, which is why he was sorta sympathetic to Lauren Southern in her recent situation

overall though I'd describe him as pretty centre, although he seems to lean sort of apathetically left on things like gender/sexuality etc. (kind of a "you can do whatever makes u happy" type of thing), and he checks his privilege to an extent when talking about racial issues

The world's democracies have always been and will always be a cringe crew. This is well crafted to look creepy, but I honestly don't see why people are losing their minds over it. Saying "fake news", given its association to Trump, is going to trigger some people. Sure. But the message that falsehoods are much more easily spread over social media and people should be on the lookout for this should not be controversial. There is some advantage to having massive media conglomerates that have a reputation to protect. Most people in the political center understand that they need to interpret FOX news through a certain lens, whereas they might not be aware of the axe that various smaller entities with no ongoing reputation may be grinding. If we get a video of all these stations reading a script that takes a particular side if an issue that would be one thing, but just putting out a fairly even handed statement about the modern media landscape across their entire network doesn't strike me as problematic. But the script is exactly something trump or some other right wing talking head would spout. Wouldn’t you agree? DestiSenpaii It's the "whatever propaganda they choose" part that I'm not sold on. This script is so harmless. If they ask their affiliates to read a script about the Jews controlling the weather I have to assume the affiliates straight up refuse.

Or maybe it's just that they fall back on prejudices they hold and can't actually see black people as... y'know people. I don't really knowchat ruined the game for Destiny. Whole point of the first play through was to do a blind run not knowing of any consequences till your next play through by either choosing the pacifist or genocide run. chat's autism wanted Destiny to start with a pacifist run, with Destiny not knowing what it even was, by crying in chat to spare Toriel(first boss) but then not telling him to save the butterscotch pie for Asgore, which is crucial in doing a pacifist run. We've truly hit peak back seat gaming with this one boys.mfw you braindead weeb fucks raised on anime think "not solving all of the world's problems" = "not working"People on the left. Like myself.

With Sam it seems like both. 

Making a statement like "The weight of American history is completely irrelevant...", when talking about issues of race and the science surrounding it, demonstrates this perfectly.

From what I've seen, they make fun of the bloodsports shit too. Most of these retards have threads over there, even Andy has one now. I don't really get the nazi thing, but I can certainly see why you'd see the site as a cesspool lol.

Also he was on Jeopardy.I'll never understand the fear of the radical left, possibly a generational thing since any true leftist thought is more or less gone in the united states. Democrats are a centrist party and the republicans have been becoming more and more radical every since the 1990s. It's hilarious JBP says that the right have "contained" their radicals even though fucking Trump is president right now with all his administrations extremist beliefs from john bolton to jeff sessions and to his base of supporters. This shit with post-modern marxists seems to be nothing but pure conspiracy yet people legit take it seriously. Also people unironically being more concerned with potential future dangers from people who have no actual power vs demagogues who not only control all 3 branches of government but have been heavily influencing public policy since the fucking 1970s.possibly, however Styx is completely overestimating how easy it is to run from office. Probably because he thinks he knows what to do but from his video he sure seems clueless. One of the main things you need to do as a new candidate is constantly canvass and get your name out to new people. In the video he says he'll rely on online messaging but unless he increases his base of viewers there is no way anyone who isn't already a styx fan will know that he's even a write in candidate.https://youtu.be/E2YVRu09nAo?t=14Nothing of you're a nihilistic piece of shit. But if you're a decent human being then you might have a problem with all the killing, political imprisonment, destruction or uncompensated seizure of people's property, and the general chaos and unpredictability that interferes with peoples' ability to live normal lives.He's a big fan of beastiality. You can't be siblings with a dog. This is the problem with corporate America. They're not allowed to cull useless employees, so we have to listen to them complain. Sure, but many countries have made progress on all of those things without violently overthrowing their governments. Pursuing violence against your political opponents instead of following a lawful process of gradual improvement has generally not worked out welI in history. What is "peaceful revolution?" Ah, blaming all the crimes of communist regimes on US intervention. Classic. It's a multinational strike. They don't want to fight us and AT LEAST 2 of our most powerful alliesThe funny thing is that people will see this  and think it is an exxagerations, but it is not too much of a stretch from the people I know most ardent against gun control probably fantasize about killing someone. It's grosshere’s a cool clip

&gt;big yikes insult to injury

masterfully done lilywowie, that's impressive and sad at the same time. I hope you took only doses of the debates at a time because listening to this stuff for 3\+ hours a day will make you lose your mindPretty sure you'll be banned if you stream on Tiwtch.FACT: no white person has ever been arrested for loitering. to use the word "literally" to intensify or exaggerate a description of something is an example of hyperbole, which isn't a misuse so much as a rhetorical device. not sure why/if the dictionary slipped in that alternate meaning but it makes perfect sense to use literally in a hyperbolic mannerAlso, situations change. Say what you want about Trump's actions and his obnoxious Twitter persona, the mere fact that his opinion changed as over time, and in response to new events like the chemical attacks, isn't what should be criticized. The real cringe is the postersI wish they'll dive deep into some of Destiny's positions, instead of another 2 hour circlejerk about how retarded his debate opponents are.shills gonna shillThe amount of people unironically saying that taxation is theft lul. 


Theft: noun- the action or crime of stealing.


Steal: verb- take (another person's property) without permission or legal right and without intending to return it.


Tax:noun-plural noun: taxes-a compulsory contribution to state revenue, levied by the government on workers' income and business profits or added to the cost of some goods, services, and transactions.


Also why are some people saying a 0% tax rate is preferable? Are libertarians secret ancaps now that don't believe in a state. link related https://me.me/i/16446100

MAEK BEBBIES [](/WORTH)I know right?

I was born in germany and I have to endure all this affordable healthcare, education, a functioning democracy, a public prison system that focuses on rehabilitation instead of punishment and multiple choices for my ISP.  
 
Shit's fucked yo&gt; He can associate with whoever he wants, and if they are the only people sticking up for him then why wouldn't he?

Because it makes a lot of people that would otherwise rally behind him less likely to do so out of fear to be associated with an actual nazi. Destiny said himself he thinks the law is bullshit and hopes Dankula wins the lawsuit, but can't support him because of how phenominally retarded he is. I'm in that same boat, I want to be on his side in all of this, but the way he conducts himself and the people he associates himself with makes this impossible.&gt;This might matter to you if you're a criminal degenerate i guess lol

Fuck being empathetic to your fellow countrymen. If you commit a crime you deserve to rot in prison and be branded a criminal for all eternity, you are so right man.

&gt;Democracy is garbage

If you vote yourself into a position where you only ever have 2 options and you have to vote for the lesser of the 2 evils instead of for someone that actually represents your interest, then your democracy has failed/is failing. Also please elaborate on your political system of choice that is so much superior to a functioning democracy, i'm sure it will involve a lot of well thought out ideas.

Depends on where you livethey actually mention the "free marketplace of idea" meme LULis it time for Destiny and Aydin round 2? tho i doubt he will ever want to talk to her againnot just an original writer but the creator of the show, Aaron McGruder, stepped down during season 4 to work on a new show called Black Jesus on adultswim i believeJust like National-Anarchism: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National-anarchismhttps://i.imgur.com/S1Tl1cd.png

https://www.history.com/news/black-panthers-gun-control-nra-support-mulford-actI like to conserve my international trade please, thanks.Is this video more interesting to watch than Destiny vods?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlSsDsBCwQs

Took you a while to figure it out.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlSsDsBCwQsHis justifications aren't very rational.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlSsDsBCwQs&gt;I feel like I've just been inducted into a cult.

That's predicated on the idea that being is partly the knownIt seems racist to me, like why? what does it matter. Everytime I hear this argument I can only really think of one of two things. This person is easily peer pressured and so hung up on what his family would think that he won't date outside his race or that person is not telling you what they really feel.

Maybe I am naive. I just don't feel like people operate on these very loose, nebulous concepts of "I need to keep the blood pure". What does he gain from this? Does he expect to get in the Guinness Book of World Records for being the only Han chinese family of "pure blood".what are the odds u think that pewdiepie actually knows about destiny's videos vs just knowing the photoyeah i guess that's what it is - i was thinking perhaps he saw the jontron debate but who knowsSeeing as how Trump wants to tear up the Iran Deal im guessing he did fuck all with the diplomacy involved here. More like South Korea just brown nosing to Trump since thats the only way he actually responds to people.smoke weed everyday&gt;You have a huge ego and do not understand math beyond a simple level either, (if you actually think showing your work in like a calc 1 or 2 course is anywhere near the same as justifying your answer in a proofs based course like real or complex analysis you are extremely wrong because when you are in those classes you are more or less following an algorithmic process to the answer with very little critical thinking and fore-thought and in proofs based courses you are drawing upon axioms and theorems that are already held to be true and using them to justify your answer vs something in social science where new data constantly disproves old shit and the only thing constant in it is how data should be collected but even then its not cuz there is constant times where undercoverage and variables that are not accounted for in the social """sciences""" I say it in quotation cuz often times they don't even follow the scientific method or how to properly carry out a statistical test).

This run-on sentence, make it stop. NotLikeThisfinal boss isn't Ben Shapiro, it's Mary Bonnell That's Sam HydeFrom what I read S. Korean political commentators are saying that moon credited Trump so that it would be less likely that Trump would fuck up the deal/negotiations if he was given responsibility for the talks. South Korea is legit playing some 4d chess. Also it's more likely than not that Trump will pull out of the Iran deal since he's literally the worst negotiator/deal maker in diplomatic history.I don't pay attention to Warski live so I had no idea, but interestingI'll concede that it proves Moon to be diplomatic."nuking africa is not genocide". Literally genocide

By far the best part of this clip was watching his shit eating grin turn into abject horror"why would I ever date Steven"...

....

Why so savage my dude?they're meming dudeu/morasyid I don't know why you even keep posting in this subreddit. If you want to change our minds then it would probably bee a good idea to stop posting ad hominems and getting triggered literally every post. Also, you know this is a left leaning sub, so why the hell are you coming to this sub if you think all libcucks are retarded anywaysI feel that this is most  peoples problem articulated pretty well. League is not a bad game to stream, obviously, especially when you have good duo partners. However, Destiny desperately wants to be someone like Qtpie or Tyler1 who has a fanbase primarily there for sick league gameplay. That's just not who he is though, it is like sticking a square in a hole. It is not going to workI guess the main problem is that the SJWs label any sort of cultural appropriation, such as the girl in the Chinese dress, as caricature. They don't want to disrespect anyone's culture so they will be strictly oppose to the idea of adopting another culture, which I feel is counterproductive if you claim to be a progressive. Having a more blended culture is needed to build a cohesive society, that is free from the "Us" vs "Them" mentality. Keeping other cultures separate only solidifies the racial biases, and stereotypes that people with brain worms have. The only reason why some people on the Right defend cultural appropriation is to mock, and dehumanize us.
Like [this](https://78.media.tumblr.com/a3775505beaa9fa9e7fe6116cd64d665/tumblr_inline_n5d68ijmMB1sdgcn2.jpg) for example.
Jaylen is literally the most annoying person he plays with, she's just a huge leech and will play with anyone to try to get famous, like how she used Destiny to try to buddy up to Lily and now Offline TV. IDK how anyone talks shit on Mouton but loves her.Is it okay if I interpret this as them silencing themselves? I mean who else put the duct tape on and made them pose for the photo?The debate with Numberless Nick was one of my favourites! So entertaining.

I'd really like to see Destiny debate Tara McCarthy more in-depth or Brittany Pettibone. 

The debate with Styx was great as well. Pro-ethnostate anarchist. Ugh. not so familiar with the people Destiny's talking to - can someone fill me in on the context of this discussion?Look I get it's sad when anyone youngish is taken from cancer or anything of the sort. But is everyone really gonna circle jerk him now that he posted this, the man everyone went after for defending JonTron? You guys are being just as hypocritical as he normally is.M E T A C U L T U R E

W A R R I O R   G E N EAsk her this 

who are the post\-modernist and what do they want? Specifically what do they have to gain from plunging society into chaos?

also question her on dominance hierarchies. Peterson claims they are natural and we have structured our society based on them, ask her why we should live our lives based on the decisions of other people who are long dead, and ask her how does human empathy play into the dominance hierarchies.

Peterson makes value claims that young men just need to suck it up. Does this seem like advice from a truly enlightened individual? and if so ask her how this can help someone who is struggling with things probably beyond their control and if she honestly thinks just telling someone to do better makes them do better.Good post, I completely agree.in the Patreon version of the video, at the very end he says "so, live your own life and make your own decisions, that's my advice for you today...**also God's not real**" but he cut it out for the official version

thought you guys might find it amusingI love the debates-with-idiots but the Contra talks are always fun - Contra did say in a livestream recently she wanted to talk to Destiny again so maybe it'll happen?I saw this last time and I legit regret reading that thread lmao what a place that islmfao the random Sargon bit was incredibleEh, not really a Destiny meme. I was saying this in elementary school 16 years agoThose who search for the meaning of life are typically those without a sense of purpose. Existentialism is a pointless meme. Our emotions are our emotions. Decisions are decisions. Altruism is altruism. Learn to be happy with the small things in life. Realize that life isn't a puzzle to solve, and spend more of your time enjoying it. You will never be satisfied if you are always looking for the final piece. Peoples' brooding is turning them into ego-driven, dissatisfied, and individualistic jerks.﻿It's cause all of the Incels on Livestreamfails can't get one girl so a man cheating is mindblowing to them. It's all just the shitty kids who love Ice Poseidon.lmfao did nathan leave oh nohaha! xD good ironic post bro, wouldnt have caught it wouldnt the /sas someone who hates himself and still plays for honor, I’ve seen a shit ton of people playing the viking and knight classes with racist/nazi player made emblems (which may just be edgy kids) along with super racist, toxic behavior. I may be looking into this too much but I’ve been seeing it more and more oftenYea just be confident in what you're saying even if it doesn't make sense or is the truth. Never budge from your convictions. How long before JF tries to impregnate her?I mean look at the comment section. My favorite is, "Creativity and message, way better than Kendrick’s!﻿"Nothing really maybe that some people are giving him too much praise.For me personally, I just find some of his music to be not that creative. Don't get me wrong, "Awaken, My Love!" was a really good album. But what I mean is the messages that he delivers is just lacking compared to other artists like Kendrick or Joey Badass. But definitely better than Kodak Black or Meek Mill when dealing with a serious topic. Overall I just feel like he's just an overrated artist, and that most artists can do what he does, but don't receive the same level of praise. I don't think he hasn't changed much from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKB66pjw-JA)Yeah I’d leave it like that, especially for a basic bitch like you. You probably find LoL to be entertaining. :)Turning Point USA (the org kanye is working with) has been training youth leaders for a while I believe. They even have yearly events to train young people to become influencers. I think the last one had Steve Bannon and a bunch of other people attend. This is all off the top of my memory though, so it may be largely bullshit.Is it just me or did they remove the ability to go from clips to the appropriate VoD timestamp? Anyone know when this happened?Huh, I just tried it with Firefox instead of Chrome and it's working now. Can someone confirm this is a Chrome issue, or is one of my extensions fucking with twitch clips? I'm confused...Sounds to me like Mitch's problem was that he perceived Destiny as disloyal, which he didn't explain well and Destiny probably can't understand on an emotional levelHey so I've done a little bit of testing. First of all the problem disappears in incognito mode, so I was curious as to why. Disabling all extensions didn't help and logging out of both reddit and twitch didn't either. 

Testing it on the Beta version of Chrome also gets rid of the problem.

Next I deleted all cookies and... it worked? Now it's important to note that this means ALL cookies, deleting only cookies associated with the twitch.tv domain didn't solve this issue. I'm not the most tech-savvy person, but this seems a little wierd to me, no? Is it normal that a cookie associated with a seemingly unrelated site can influence something like this? I mean I guess this is a solution to the problem, but this is still a little wierd, especially considering I don't remember ever changing anything on twitch that would get rid of this button to begin with :/kill yourself [](/OverRustle)What?? Bias news in r/destiny?? Noooo...the one with Charlamagne tha God? That was a pretty good interviewAnti is fucking one of the dumbest members of the Children's Party Game Competitive Scene and that's saying something. He always has retarded takes on literally everything.The words 4, who follow anti because they think he's funny. Don't really need to be in there.

Notch also donated 10,000 dollars to a female streamer who he flew out to Sweden to fuck, so he clearly is not that great with his money.Holy shit this is the cringiest article I've ever seen.Guys I was at the bank and gave the guy behind me my bank card and pin number, now all my money is gone. I called the bank and asked them for it all back, how was I supposed to know he was gonna steal it.You have to see it from their point of view. Children will bully people who are different.

If some kid dropped into Destiny's chat and talked about how he didn't torture his dog he'd be bullied too. Actually this might be accurate asides from the jewish conspiracy stuff. World leaders or powerful financial brokers can move the stocks with their words alone. A good example was back when Ben Bernanke was in front of the FED and seemed to suggest another stimulus packet might be in the works. As a result the stock market shot up like 80 points only to fall the same amount like 10 mins later after he clarified that there would be no new stimulus package. Same can be seen recently with whatever Trump says or attacks; the market will react because it has to. So if Trump is talking tariffs then we'll see dips in the market due to increased anxiety of the market.

That being said the purpose of Netanyahu's speech was to convince(and lie to) trump about Iran's nuclear programs. I doubt his aim was to do some money scheme with oil stocks. Again it's just the market reacting to the events in real time, which is why i find the #nomorejewishtricks really distasteful and completely missing the point of Netanayhu's goals.it's about 2 hours long if you have the time to kill:

thats great to hear. also really loved the banter between him and poki, she didnt take shit. but i really think that he could offer some amazing insight into streaming and all the things around it. I really like how poki has a well structured podcast and thinks about the topics. I'll reserve most judgement for now and give her the benefit of the doubt - I'm a little concerned about the slightly self-pitying tone of it but I guess they were friends so it makes sense


I feel like the title of the post is sorta sensational tho lol&gt;I don't think it's discriminatory to separate cats and dogs

Literally different species, not an argument.


&gt; or pugs and pitbulls

Why? Are you under the delusion that a trained pitbull is a danger to a pug? Do you think different breeds of dog are inherently agressive, something multiple studies across multiple countries have adressed and disproven?

&gt;If you were the type of person to believe that people of different races [] would be mutually better off if they were just isolated from eachother

You're trying to give this a nice package by saying "I jsut want them all to be better off", but what you are saying in essence is that there are inherent differences between races that are so drastic that living together will always result in a worse experience than just separating them. This is racist and I'm sorry if that offends you, but I didn't invent the term, nor its definition. When you have ideas and opinions that fit the definition of a term, then own it, don't bullshit your way out of it with your idiotic half-truths and semantic games.

&gt;That being said, most people pushing the idea of a white ethnostate probably hate black people

I would hate black people too if I'd life with this delusion that the inclusion of black people into society would somehow lead to a worse experience for everyone involved, even themselves.I told you to kill yourself [](/OverRustle)Yeah it's just trying to save face now, fuck Shoe on HeadDon’t worry buddy, after watching it some more, and learning about the hidden meaning of the video, I’ve changed my mind.&gt; Are you kidding?

No

&gt;A dog bred to fight is better at fighting

Noone disagrees with this. I disagree with your initial argument that presumed that just because a breed is better at fighting it automatically means it is a dangerous breed. That is retarded. An MMA fighter is probably a fuck ton better at fighting than the average murderer. There have been countless of studies that proove that the breed of a dog does not suggest its agressiveness or danger. The danger, or agressiveness of a dog is 100% determined by its environment.

&gt;If a german shepherd has a disagreement with a chihuahua, maybe they shouldn't be left alone in the same room.

If the german sheperd wasn't properly trained then of course you are right. This has nothing to do with its race though. If a Labrador isn't properly trained it shouldn't be left in a room with something as small as a chihuahua either. Making this about the breed of the dog instead of its training and upbringing shows how fundamentally little you know about dogs.

Your entire second paragraph is idiotic as you adress a point I never made. I specifically said "*differences between races* **that are so drastic that living together will always result in a worse experience than just separating them**". The second part of that statement is kinda fucking important as it completely changes the meaning of the first part. Noone argues that there are visual differences between **black** people and **white** people, it's in the fucking name.

&gt;And then there are cultural differences

Ah yes, because a black person in America will identify more with the culture of Africa than white Americans. Not necesarilly your argument, but the argument of enough white ethno trash that it's worth mentioning just exactly how retarded that argument is.

&gt;I mean personally I just wish people could get along despite their differences.

Great, we want the same thing then.

&gt;It's possible to see people with real tangible differences the same way

Again, basically what I was saying so I'm glad we agree.

&gt;Homie literally posted the dictionary definition of racism.

He said that "*It would only be racist, if Squidward believes that only his people have a right to a ethnostate*". This is not even close to the definition of racism. An ethnostater can absolutely advocate for blacks to have their own ethnostate and still be racist if he argues for the removal of colored people based on a feeling of superiority towards them.

&gt; When I see this called "racist" I take it as synonymous with "hateful", "wrong", "ignorant"

I wouldn't necesarilly call him racist just based on that comment, but I would raise concerns about his very flawed understanding of racism.

&gt;"if you disagree you are wrong" type mindset

Not at all I welcome people to disagree with me. But the idea that "*the inclusion of black people into society would somehow lead to a worse experience*" is delusional. It is not backed by any data I have ever seen and is almost exclusively an idea pushed by people that argue felaciously for something that they don't even understand. That's not me saying "*if you disagree with me, you are wrong*", that's me saying "*if you disagree with factual evidence without presenting data that contradics these facts, you are wrong*"I'm sure you'd love to fuck anything bud.Because she's attacked Destiny in the past for asking why she doesn't argue against really insane points that her "friends" make. It's not like LS hasn't been this way the whole time, so doing it now is disingenuous and just a move to try to save face.oh man i love this group wowWhat's with the Turning Point USA logos in the background? That organization runs [Professor Watchlist](https://www.professorwatchlist.org/), a website that lists professors accused of "discriminating against conservative students and promoting leftist propaganda."

Apparently, the organization is pretty shady. It has attempted to influence student government elections, past employees have claimed the organization was engaged in racist practices, and TP was potentially illegally involved in the 2016 presidential election.&gt; absolutely more violent on average than other dogs

What you linked doesn't support that statement. Pitbull are far stronger than other breeds because they were specifically bred to fight , noone disputes that, so obviously an agressive pitbull is far more dagerous than an agressive chihuahua. What you linked are fatalities, not overall attacks. An attack by a breed that is "designed" to kill will more likely lead to a fatality, so with the data you linked it is absolutely possible that the overall amount of attacks from pitbulls is far lower than that of for example Labradors.

I would argue that even a statistic like [this](https://petolog.com/articles/dogs-attack-statistics.html) is relatively meaningless as most "attacks" by something as insignificant as a chihuahua or other small breeds that cause little to no harm won't be fairly represented, while practically every single attacks of a german sheperd or Pitbull, will.

Also the entire premiss of this comparison is, in my opinion, inherently flawed. These dogs were, over the course of multiple generations specifically bred to become the ultimate killing machine.  
**IF** you were to breed humans over the course of multiple generations into something that is designed to kill we can have a different discussion, but to my knowledge Africans were nowhere near as selectively bred as dogs and not over as many generations, not even close.

&gt;breed matters in determining the behavior of dogs

Again these fascist fucks miss the point. Yes, the breed of a dog matters to an extent. If you wanna breed a fighting dog for example you're not gonna start with a fucking Chihuahua, you're most likely going to start with something that already has the "groundwork done". But the far more important part when it comes to determining a dogs behaviour is its upbringing and environment. You can teach and train a pitbull to be the most loving dog you will ever know, incapable of hurting a fly and you can fuck up a Labrador to a point where it becomes a massive piece of shit and attacks everything on sight. As with humans the genetics are nowhere near as important (if at all) than the environment.

edit:*"While a dog’s genetics may predispose it to behave in certain ways, genetics do not exist in a vacuum. Rather, behavior develops through a complex interaction between environment and genetics."* -[The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals](https://www.aspca.org/about-us/aspca-policy-and-position-statements/position-statement-pit-bulls) damn you've been missing out, his music is great. also 25 over here Absolutely! It's just like those folks who 'abandoned' the Left and aligned themselves with right-wing (or far-right) ideologies because they got swept away in the extremist SJW hysteria.

Those people who abandoned their beliefs so easily never had those beliefs to begin with. A person who truly believes in their convictions defends them and doesn't adopt the polar opposite position because of some hysterical extremists.jesus christ that intro to the brittany venti video is ridiculous When thousands of professional dog trainers, American institutions on animal cruelty and behaviour and a plethora of studies come to the conclussion that dog behaviour is mostly molded and formed by their environment and their genetics play an almost insignificantly small role, but you gotta find a new argument to advocate for an ethnostate, because every single argument you came up with beforehand has been factually retarded.  
Keep on spouting the pitbull meme, eventually you'll move on to the next retarded argument why genetics are so much more important than environment.who doesn't tbhHoly shit, the bots are contagiousDid this conversation with devin happen recently? If so someone please link the vod and timestamp.when is destiny going on his trip?Don't do Ketamine, fuck that synthetic shit.

Yeah, but did he say he was going there during this trip? Do you have the timestamp?God I love the anti-SJW mindset. You make a small group of people on the internet with no real power angry so it's worth destroying the country over! Nice meme!
He did it already? Wasn't he supposed to do it with Devin?there; not their. :)He's back! KreygasmI am glad he doesn't fully submerge himself into internet bloodsport, because it makes moments like these better.i love this a lot 

never thought i'd see destiny playing this game of all games

edit: dancing to Hyuna of all things I'm done1. I wish he'd just embrace that he's a conservative and I feel like he's pretty dumb at times (although well-spoken) - not a fan
2. I should do it, I have been making some efforts to at least consume less meat. Overall a better moral argument (although I wish my vegan friends would stop theatrically talking about how meat is disgusting and revolting)
3. I actually really dislike him, he's probably one of my least favourite people in the right-wing section of YouTube bc of how smug and wrong he is (but he's also fucking hilarious with how bizarre he is)
4. Idk if anything is gonna come of it but I like that it's lowkey giving sex workers better press in some circles lol. Any outcome is pretty unsurprising here
5. The name is honestly pretty tainted now but it's a good message and a good movement - black people are still getting fucked in America&gt;is apartment belonged to his mom, he got his job through a friend, and he gets his gaming hardware through friends. He, like many incels I believe, is delusional and probably has some kind of social anxiety disorder. 

I agree with the general idea of what you're saying but lets not act like confidence = financial success. You could be brilliant in tech/ academics and get a good paying job and still be the most socially inept person. In my opinion attractiveness and confidence promolgate themselves in some sort of feedback loop, if you're attractive people, especially women, treat you way better, because why wouldn't they, you're hot right? That attention tends to make you more open and social, which surprise, surprise, women also likeEvery single character in this picture is married to a woman and has a job.  
You couldn't get further from the average Lifestreamfails failure in life.As opposed to the masterpiece of historic accuracy that is the Battlefield series.Let's be real:  
That trailer was garbage. But not because of the women or black people in it.A developer making unsubstantiated claims to advertise their videogame? What a world we live in.

Also worth mentioning "literal ninjas" is such a good observation. In fact it is so good, it literally comes from the future, as the trailer doesn't show "literal ninjas", but I guess hyperbole wins arguments these days?

ALSO worth mentioning, that what you qualify as "fairly small" is fucking hillarious my dude. I know right? Who would use a Katana in world war 2? [Right](https://www.quora.com/Did-Japanese-soldiers-use-their-katana-in-WW2)?

But you know what would be even more retarded? Using Bow and arrow, now that would just be stupid, [right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Churchill)?CAN WE PLEASE GET RID OF THESE FUCKING BOTS?  
Just click the fucking link ffs.I was referring to you calling the idea of "literal ninjas" in WW2 preposterous. After being questioned about it you referred to a soldier having a Katana, which made me think a soldier having a Katana is enough to qualify him as a "literal ninja". My link was supposed to proof that by your own standards "literal ninjas" fought in the actual WW2.

I could also go after your other statement about "pirates", by which I asume you are referring to the woman with the metal 
prosthesis. If so I invite you to do a 2 minute google search. Many soldiers fought with prosthesis, because of injuries either sustained during WW1 or WW2. 

I've said in another comment that there are many legitimate problems with this trailer, but this "historical accuracy" meme is borderline autistic. You are literally raging because of a single fucking Katana. 

Any other complaint is fucking stupid. Women did serve as soldiers. Many soldiers fought with prosthesis. This one fucking sword could have many explanations within the story that make perfect fucking sense. Shoe on head isn't looking super white there, will she be allowed in Lauren's all white ethnostate?do you know if it will be posted to youtube?I don't think it was a date, but he met up with some 19/20 year old discord mod. Though it's kinda weird to go to a city that has nothing in it but a person, so who knows maybe it was a date.Honestly looks like Michael Phelps

Like he's not even a charismatic man like some of the other ones.They totally do. You never played with a kid and had them hold onto your arm as you lifted them up and down?I'm sorry I forgot I was in the Destiny subreddit and that at least half the people here are autistic, and a quarter only have interactions with kids through loli.**Archived tweets:**

If you're interested in reading the study I'll see if I can find it.Goes into the whole arbitrator of your own destiny (lul) meme. The Sargons will say that if women wanted to do x job they would choose to do that and Destiny would argue that people's decisions are controlled by their experiences/ societal pressures. You realize that was years and years ago? That's probably why you never saw anyone call that out...You know also I don't know what you know about it but threatening to hurt a kid is not the same as plotting to murder a kid. There was no plotting to murder, just threats by a frustrated destiny that he shouldn't have done and has apologized for. The point is nobody is discussing this because it's not relevant just because JF and gang bring it up as a whataboutism defense of JF's rape. I miss the good old days when you could identify copypastas by their absurdity.you can go back about 2 mins when they start talking about climate change, and it would go on for about 25 mins.high quality meme doesn't need much effort 10/10around 2:30 hours in, Mitch literally reveal that he didn't get anything out of this conversation. He literally think that Destiny agree with everything he says, that everyone is fake, and everyone owes him an apology. I would love for destiny to move on and never talk to mitch againwhile just Trump's twitter *if his mom has bipolar disorder that is definitely what we are seeing here.

From what little I know about Reckful he's sort of a millionaire? So that should work out just fine.He does have that money, but even if he didn't, he could.

https://www.loc.gov/law/help/investor-visas/netherlands.phpMaybe I am reading too much into it, I feel like destiny did have some sort of attraction before, maybe when he was young, that's why he is so open for "new experience" with "cutie guys" in the futureAbsolutelyYou gotta appreciate their commitment to believing that there are simply too many men and not enough women in a country where non monogamous marriage is illegal and there are more women than men.

^please ^don't ^ban ^meAs someone who has finished Mankind Divided the game is tremendous and so is the dlc for it. I took a long break in the middle of it but once the game gets going it's amazing. You really should play it through. You get used to it but yeah its a little wonky at first. This also might just be my bias showing. The story, the characters (other than Jenson who is awesome), and the gameplay are all good but nothing spectacular. The setting is just so incredibly interesting and immersive though and for me that's what I value most. I mean if you only enjoy the game for the main story sure then it's pointless. Many of the side quests are seperate from the story too.        
 I love being in the super immersive universe though and the dlc allows for more of that while being different and fun.I used to converse and challenge incels back when /r/Incels was still around. I couldn't tolerate it past a day.

The self-fulfilling prophecy is exceptionally strong in that community. None of them would believe that a non-Chad, like myself, could have multiple partners. 

To answer your question -- how to begin conversing with a Braincel? Well, you'll need to find those who are receptive to constructive dialogue with an opposing viewpoint. They need to believe that there is value in such a dialogue, and that they themselves might be wrong... and in which case they reform their worldview. Good luck finding those in that community, though. It's such an insular, controlling echo-chamber that doesn't engage in good faith. God damn that might have been the worst pro meat argument I've ever seen in the Bourdain clip. It's incredible how people can be so successful and yet so brain dead.A manlet at 5'11"? I'm 5'3", and only a few folks over at /r/Incels had anything to say. Haven't had the pleasure of being called a manlet, yet though.

Anonymity can really bring out thoughts and feelings people wouldn't otherwise publicly share, or allow them to dabble with "edgier" ideas, emotions, and interactions in a "safer" environment.

These people might be insecure themselves and projecting their own self-hatred or low self-esteem onto others, they could be doing it for that feeling of domination and affirming their ego... y'know, having that sense of control over a person and feeling a sense of self-importance.

I found many of the people who had negative things to say about irrelevant things towards myself or others did so because they were in an unhappy/frustrated state about their life.I have no mouth, yet I must kekLiterally every sub with a political slant that I have been to is a circle jerk. Even those debate"x" political group subs are circlejerks because the only people who populate them have bought into the meme hardcore. I just don't know exactly what he expects. I don't think he even knows what he expects. 

From what I have heard destiny doesn't seem to be particularly interested in JP, which is fine, but this sub and literally every left\-leaning publication and website are taking a stab at him because he is a perfect political manisfestation at the toxic identity politics of "cis\-white men". People talk about this all the time like it is some controversial opinoin he has. Unless you are on the far left in America you probably are not a full blown socialist. 

Hell, even most socialist will tell you that capitalism has been the most succesful worldwide. Most leftist just like to shit on capitalism. You can dislike capitalism without immediately being labeled as a communist/neo\-marxist/whatever. Unless you are a conservative retard, in that case, everything slightly right is anti\-capitalist, sociaist degeneracyJapan, like America, was also a deeply imperialist nation that literally thought "Japanese were the superior asian" and tried to subjugate east asian countries to their economic whim. So, sure Japan is a prosperous country in the economic sense, but you can't divorce that from the fact that they exploited other countries to get ahead. Sound familiar

Also, I don't know how well informed these guys are on japanese culture, but Japan especially in the big city is probably one of the most socially isolating places to live. Have you heard of NEETS,otaku, or herbivore men(?)

I think the real question when it comes to diversity is why not? The only way you can justify having a homogenous country is if you believe that race is correlated with genetics, specifically the kind of genetics that make you smarter. Or you believe that the gene pool needs to stay pure for social homogenity. If you don't buy into either of these the only reason to want an ethnostate is either flat out racism, or to play some sort of weird dungeons and dragons fantasyi was so sure this is gonna be a gnome meme.Why do people try to pretend that the USPS isn't one of the greatest government run programs ever? 

The program is so good that some other countries think that the stories about it are literal propaganda. 

Try sending a letter from South Florida to Alaska for 49 cents w/ UPS/Fed Ex/DHL. I don't know what you're talking about but I think Steven very much enjoyed interacting with Paul. Paul is like that young person from another part of the world that you have to civilise, except that both Paul and Steven live in the US.they are special freedom plans, only available in the US, where you pay way too much to get a little bit of mobile datado you know when the podcast is in hours?nice, thank you :)Indeed, [I even wrote a post here arguing these points a few months back](https://www.reddit.com/user/YeeBOI123/comments/82bglp/since_destiny_deleted_it_a_serious_conversation/), which BadBunny possibly had Destiny delete from the subreddit.That's clearly not the context in which it's being discussed. She's rejecting the claim that it even IS being used with malice today.[Bonus meme.](https://i.imgur.com/6pGxVGO.png)Man, all my friends keep telling me about this movie they saw last week, about how groundbreaking and meaningful it was, and I'm like, do these retards not understand that all the movie is, is simply photons hitting a projector screen and then their eyes? LMAO !!Yes, this came up in the last thread while it was still alive where I argued pretty much what you say.

&gt;When Destiny is debating people, he usually tries to do his best to engage with the best possible interpretation of their ideas. When it comes to calling a random chatter out, it's usually a short "link or IP ban", or "fuck off retard", after which he moves on. Sometimes there is a bit of back and forth, but I still feel he's way more laid back and doesn't actively strive to ridicule people, unless they manage to more or less do it for him. I don't ever remember Destiny dedicating a large amount of time antagonizing a viewer to the same extent to which BadBunny does.Hey y’all. I was thinking today that if destiny were to RIP, there doesn’t seem to be anyone else in the world who could take his place. He is a one of a kind broski.

But if he did I just wanted to let you all know that I’m happy to take his place if they sad day ever came. I am a little less smart and a little way less good at video games but I am a little more handsome so I hope that makes up for it. I will edit this post one day with my twitch name if I do not RIP first. Thank you and I’m sorry for the negative thoughts.

This is by far the best meme ever appear in this subLikewise. I got drawn in by the 'YouTube Skeptics' and the typical anti-SJW hysteria. I started to adopt alt-right beliefs myself. Y'know, "ironically" flirting with ethno-nationalism, fascism, protecting "Western civilization," race realism, Islamophobia, anti-feminism, etc. etc.

Destiny's debate with JonTron challenged my thinking, and though I was resistant to his position at first, something made me keep returning to that debate until I started to stray away from alt-right beliefs. If that is the average then we are either all like that or a portion of us are even more extreme, to compensate for alpha male redpills like OP.

That's how average personalities works like, right? I've already read the Harvard report, but where did you find the meta analysis? I don't have much experience looking for big studies and such. I tried scholar.google but it didn't show me jack shit lol.It kind of sounds like he heard most of this from a Supplement Superstores employee and a little google search.But if you take it with food, wouldn't that solve the issue?Sooo apparently *dailyprogress* is geoblocked in the EU because of some law? Big loss for marketplace of memes\&gt; non-existent Nazis running for office in the Republican Party

But sure, keep being afraid of the big red boogeyman.

\&gt; Leftism is taking over the Democrat party

I'll take the Leftism every day of the week over the fashism that has already taken over the GOPOP also being unironic soooo...seeing a lot of these posts about “muh destiny got banned for saying Faggot when other streamers say it all the time” shut up lol pointing out that other streamers say the same shit isn’t going to unban destiny Psychotherapists from the balkan? Dis gon' be good. (for those wondering, people from the balkan are extraordinarily pragmatic) But i feel like your name could be a joke on 'Lud, zbunjen, normalan' so not sure if trolling. It's literally four incredibly HISTORICALLY racist depictions of minorities. That image was from a much older cartoon from an infamous racist cartoonist active in the 80s. The way the black man is depicted there also has long history of being a racist depiction. Same thing with the Asian man. That shit is straight out of racist depictions of Asians from the fucking 1800s. To say that someone could spend even a cursory amount of time reviewing this image and not see anything racist about it makes me wonder if you are either brain damaged or if you just like defending racists.

Edit: the only one you MIGHT get away with claiming ignorance on is the racist depiction of the Hispanic man. But that's only 1/4. You still need to somehow justify the rest of the racist shit.Yes, i know what it means. Zbunjen is also used as slang to denote (in a nice way) someone is mentally not right. That's why the name seemed to be some kind of joke to me when taking into account your father is a psychotherapist. 

I assumed your parents were born in the balkan region due to your name. But if he's actually Austrian, meh, I'll save the popcorn for another day. ;) 


Great take from the [guy](https://old.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/8eaykt/count_dankula_gets_an_800_fine_for_his_joke/dxvdp12/)  that thinks democracy is garbage and who doesn't care about the state of the American prison system. You share those neurons of yours with him?The United States should remove all taxes and replace them with two new taxes: a tax on carbon and a tax on land to pay for all expenses. Some of the older generation here is used to room temperatures of 60F. And I think a lot of people prefer to sleep in a room that's about that temperature.The increasing lack of education is more responsible for an increase in incels than any female behaviour.&gt;No, it's 4chan memes you fucking retard.

https://images.encyclopediadramatica.rs/thumb/4/4a/A_world_without_jews_and_blacks.jpg/250px-A_world_without_jews_and_blacks.jpg
This image is a from infamous cartoonist "A Wyatt Mann" who was most active in the late 80s and 90s. His art has been featured across a variety of racist hotspots including Stormfront and *gasp* 4chan. Boiling it down to "4chan memes" is really fucking stupid and just ignores the history.

That just covers "Le happy merchant". Now let's look at the depiction of the asian man.

Racist depiction of asians highlighting features such as prominent forward splayed teeth, especially the two front teeth, dates back to before the 1900s. Take this image from 1899.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/YellowTerror.jpg/350px-YellowTerror.jpg

This has been a common way of derogatory depictions of asians since. Even Dr Suess made one.

As for the depiction of black people do I even need to get into it? I can if you want but I'd be posting everything from anti-emancipation cartoon to classic Disney shorts.

If you still honestly believe that someone who's been such a prominent politician for as long as Ron Paul has does not understand the historical context of these images, then you are either being insanely dishonest or you are so naive that it might be pertinent to get yourself tested for lead poisoning.  
Again, this is a prominent politician who's been in the game for quite a while. In addition, it's likely his staff screens his tweets, like most other politicians. In fact, when it was taken down, he claimed that it was his staff that posted it without his knowledge. Whether that last part is true or not can be speculated on.

You may want to consider visiting your local diagnostic clinic and request this test: 
https://www.labcorp.com/test-menu/34001/protoporphyrin-free-erythrocyte-and-zinc-protoporphyrinHoly fuck you actually compete for Dunebug levels of head density. Is it just one big brick of over-calcified bone? Your neck must be strong as hell.

This is coming from Ron Paul's OFFICIAL account. It is meant to be representative of him. That means that either he posted that image or someone representing him posted that image. Either way he is the one who's culpable. When you hire someone to spread your message YOU are responsible for the contents. Otherwise you can just scapegoat some anonymous staff member when people call you out for racism. Also to note: He never actually apologized or denounced it. He just said it was offensive and a mistake that it was posted. Then posted something about anti-political correctness.

Additionally, this isn't just the corner of a picture. Trying to frame it as such is insanely dishonest. There are literally five characters in the entire image. Four of which are racist. They are essential features in the cartoon. The depiction of the jewish person is right up, is the only unobstructed depiction of a face and that face is about the same size as the depiction of uncle sam's. Glad to know you think this image isn't immediately obvious as racist propaganda.Or you know, maybe he just feels like a fucking idiot not being able to say a word in a clearly non-hateful context to better emphasize a point.Do you think that in times of war Iceland is going to keep importing food? The point is that Iceland can easily farm/fish for more calories than they need to consume, and is thus self sustainable and shouldn't be colorcoded as if it is not.

Same for the Netherlands, which is the [second biggest food exporter](https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2016/23/nederland-tweede-landbouwexporteur-ter-wereld) in the world.This is definitely wrong. The Netherlands is the second biggest net food exporter in the world. 

And a [study](https://resource.wur.nl/nl/show/Nederland-kan-zelfvoorzienend-zijn-met-voedsel.htm) by the LEI showed that The Netherlands can be autarkic in times of war if it adjust its production.

I really cannot imagine Sweden and Finland being selfsufficient but not the Netherlands. If you look at Google Earth, essentially any area that is not urban is either greenhouses or farmlands. We also have some of the highest crop yields in the world. We also fish. So if it's just about shipping, we could easily adjust our diet and be selfsustainable. Did you just say the n-w*rd-word? I think you shouldn't use that word because it directly refers to the actual word, and using that in any sentence is obviously racist in all contexts.

Maybe you should delete this post.&gt;but political debates are 11/10?

Please explain Cigarette's&gt; A dictatorship would be good under perfect conditions.

OP would probably disagree with this statement since, the dictator even if they are perfectly good only lasts so many years. 

&gt; But in the real world with real people with real issues, Socialism goes to shit far more quickly and with a much harsher result than capitalism. The highest quality of life in the history of the human race has occurred under capitalism and every single attempt at any other system has produced a demonstrably lower quality of life. If quality of life is your endgame, it's a complete non-argument which one should be tried.

The largest improvement economically in the 20th century was Soviet Russia. The largest improvement economically in the 21st century is China. Neither is a great example of what socialism would actually be, but neither country was capitalist under their improvement. &gt; I don't have any stats on this and I'm too lazy to look up random numbers. However I'm betting that cigarette sales have gone down.

This took maybe 5 min of searching google. [US Cigarette Consumption](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/US_annual_adult_per_capita_cigarette_consumption.png) this only goes to 1998, but it still goes down slightly after that. Now, take a look at other areas of the world like [Southeast Asia](https://international.thenewslens.com/article/90722). It is almost like they are using the [exact same tactics](https://seatca.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cnn-table-678x381.png) and selling their products to very young people in different countries. Almost like the system doesn't self regulate. 

&gt; The idea isn't that bad products magically go away instantly

Okay, but the main idea I would present is: Products that only do harm, have no redeeming aspects and that push all of their externalities away from their profit line. Oh, right I almost forgot they are also responsible for one of the most successful propaganda campaigns in the world, and that they are still doing the exact same thing just in different countries that don't have the laws to prevent them because they learned from their fuck up in the states and now are working directly with governments. 

&gt; the point is that if you smoke you're going to be a poorer person, you're going to be less fit, you're going to be more likely to die early and all of these things limit your impact on society.

Sounds like you would be an excellent customer for the giant tobacco companies. 

&gt; Compare this to a product that helps you achieve things: you'll be more capable of influencing society, you'll be able to live longer and so on. You'll be a much more useful customer.

Is that the best most ppl can hope to achieve? Being a "much more useful customer"??? Seems like there has to be a better system out there. Perfect impression of PetersonLol I love his voice, it makes stuff like this sound greatI was gonna say something like this - aren't computers and things like that basically consequence-free slaves?30-Day Bantano is what seals the deal heretfw Phil's opening meme was so long i had to remove punctuation to fit it in the title, but also lowkey that works with his speaking stylewhat's the difference? I feel like the main differences I can think of between a slave and an android would fit under the umbrella of "consequences". take away the consequences from a slave (sentience, ability to feel pain etc.) and you end up with just a computer, right?

&gt; The Youtube DLC has been by far some of the greatest content released in Destiny to date. It managed to cut down on a lot of the downtime grinding through League streams and gives you the ability to jump on and hammer out a few topics real fast. [This Destiny's child?](https://youtu.be/p83SSGhzT34) I'm hella autismo but I feel like I would have handled that with no problems at all.

Like, all you have to do:

&gt;Lean out behind the phone and chuckle at them

&gt;Turn the phone 180 degrees

&gt;"I'm just shitposting on reddit".

&gt;Turn the phone back 180 degrees

&gt;Let out a brief "pff" while shaking your head as you get back into your shitposting

&gt;They now feel awkward instead.I think what the people in here are missing is that this could have been happening during a conversation between Twitch and Destiny in which he asked them to temporarily unban him to gain access to his streamlabs? Kinda seems like the most likely circumstance, no?[](/LeRuse)this is such a weird situation to choose from. why go out of your way to bring up an incredibly divisive issue when talking about car stickers? he probably thinks he can make this type of lazy argument because he probably won’t receive any sort of backlash from his presumably “cis” majority community. It's from the end of the last stream, like an hour ago.

https://www.twitch.tv/videos/287957228If I recall correctly, it is. That's why it's just discord.gg/destiny rather than discord.gg/&lt;random characters&gt;. I could be wrong on that though.Oh. The porn channels are gone now. I hadn't even noticed.Good fucking botWasn't he banned because of his crypto currency scam or something?I'm not sure when, but he talked about something similar a couple years (maybe only months?) ago. Basically his argument came down to "you lose a lot of viewers, even if you stop the stream only for a short duration". Also I can only imagine how annoying it would become after only a day of doing this. It's a result of Obama's biographer, that I think it was, making a mistake and writing that Obama is born in Kenya but grew up in Hawaii.This is actually one of the few instances I disagree with PeterNorway (whom I follow on Twitter). I'm not shadowbanned myself but I do believe it's aimed at conservatives and it does not have anything to do with "low quality". Twitter states it is based on accounts being "trolls" but that is just too broad. There are dozens of ways you can be a trroll. For instance, you could link to Never going to give you up and you're a troll. Should you then be shadowbanned?What's your solution? 

A $100-$200/tonne carbon tax would actually be very useful IF the United States manages to enforce it globally. Relax dude. Watch some AlmodovarSure. Twitter states on its own blog it now [shadowbans "trolls"](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/Serving_Healthy_Conversation.html).

They also say that they shadowban accounts that don't violate their Terms of Service, but they don't like for some reason. Do you realise what kind of precedent that sets? 

Trolls could also mean that they ban any comedian they don't like, such as Sacha Baron Cohen.

If the algorithm also bans people who are not trolls it is too broad.

Twitter has now admitted in a blogpost that they had an algorithm where users were discriminated upon, but calls it a "mistake". I don't buy it. Multibillion dollar companies don't make "mistakes" in production like that.They've already stated they don't take action against Trump's account in the name of public interest. That doesn't invalidate anything I said.Doesn't matter, it was about who Twitter is actually targetting. Nice way of moving the goalpostsI love you =)Yeah, don't we all miss the good content like league and lords mobile.To enjoy life doing the things i like and to make a difference, to as many people as I can. To create relationships, experiences and offspring, which will make a mark on the world after I'm gone from it. To the people saying yes, I got a few quesions:

Should you be fired for actions you commited 3+ years ago, even after issuing a public apology? Especially when, from what I have seen, most of these comments were made in response to pretty nasty stuff against herself?  
Cause the last time I read this subreddit, I got the impression that we were all pretty much on board that Disney fucked up by firing James Gunn and I quite frankly don't see the massive difference that makes people believe this journalist shoud be fired, while at the same time advocating for James Gunn getting rehired. Anyone care to give me an answer to that?Do people not realized he linked another climate change denial article?&gt;ignoring the fact that 90% of her tweets were not in response to anyone, but just general blanket statements.

Could you link some? Because the ones that are shown in the article are all in response to either direct harrasment against herself, or in response to a more or less popular event/situation at the time that, **in her eyes**,  involved white people acting extremely priviledged. I'm not saying that her perception of these events couldn't have been wrong, but compared to someone like Jessica Price, who frequently, without any provocation posted similar tweets, she seems to have a more or less valid justification for her posts.

&gt;She didn't apologize for her actions, she handwaved them away as a form of "counter-trolling"

Maybe I'm being naive here, but to me contextualizing tweets that were blatantly ripped out of context and then apologising for them by saying you regret posting them is a fine apology. I understand and agree that her's and James Gunns apology are different, but I wouldn't agree that she "handwaved" the critizism. 

She did what many, including Destiny has done many times in the past, when faced with ~~retarded~~ dumb comments, she mimiced the logic of the original comment in an attempt to make fun of it. Doesn't always work and from what I've seen of her twitter she took it too far in some instances, but it's something many people do and apologising by saying you regret doing it is acceptable in my eyes.

I think there is an argument to be made that during the hiring process, **if** the NY Times was aware of those tweets, they should have demanded them to be removed, but I think having someone fired for things that were done before their engagement with a company should only be done if the person in question is unapologetic, which in this instance doesn't seem the case.&gt; Well, here's where our opinions diverge. There's no excuse for racist rhetoric ever,

I take it you're not a fan of Steven then, correct? Considering he has done this many times in the past (KKK-cross, cuban comments that got him banned, etc). I personally don't consider any of these bad, because with added context they lose practically all of the vitriol, but with your 0 tolerance stance regarding racist statements, it logically follows that you are opposed to every single one of these, correct?

&gt;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DjkoOl4U4AAvHCt.jpg

This is exactly why I added this "*or in response to a more or less popular event/situation at the time that, in her eyes, involved white people acting extremely priviledged.*"

I'm not going through every single one of them, but the "cancelwhitepeople" for example was in response to outrage against "[Serial](https://serialpodcast.org/season-one)". I'm not familiar with this *podcast*, but apparently a lot of people (in her eyes probably white people) started a hashtag around that time, aimed to cancel the show, thus her reaction "cancelwhitepeople". This is clearly a reaction to a situation and not just a random, out of nowhere outburst. Was the reaction justified? Debatable, probably not, but it was a reaction nonetheless and if you actually use [this](https://twitter.com/search-advanced?lang=en&amp;lang=en) website to go and look up every single one of those tweets, so are practically all the rest. Again, I'm not arguing that her reaction wasn't out of line in some cases and her "mimicing" and "trolling" took it to far sometimes, but I think it's important not to try and paint her as someone that regularly has random, racist outbursts, that are aimed at white people. I think the obfuscation of this context in a lot of the reporting triggered her to try and explain her actions before her apology.

&gt;No different than people on the alt-right who also "satirically" post racist comments on Twitter. 

This is something we will disagree even more on, but equating someone that is evidentally edgy and makes dumb comments to people that unironically advocate for an ethnostate is irresponsible. If you consider yourself and alt-righter then there is nothing "satirical" about the vitriol you post on social media. 

&gt;it's disappointing that the NYT isn't choosing to teach her this lesson

Again, going back to James Gunn, I can make exactly the same arguments and many people on here would immediately jump down my throat: "James Gunn needs to learn that acting like a little child has consequences and I'm glad Disney taught him this lesson". I just personally don't feel comfortable with companies punishing people for behaviour that should have been clear to them during the hiring process. If I hire someone that spreads literal nazi propaganda on his twitter, I can't act all shocked when it is revealed a year later that he spread nazi propaganda. If literally any of these tweets would have been from 2018, or even 2017, I'd get your point, but firing her for 3-4 year old comments that are intentionally devoid of context to make them seem worse, when she seems apologetic for those comments doesn't really teach her a lesson imo.what the fuck? why am I a target now? monkaS

With a republican senate/house? A whole bunch of absolutely nothing.I facepalmed when I saw this post, too. He even mentioned in his own stream that Alex Jones' banning is akin to Kristallnacht.

He was railing about how the state needs to intervene to protect this type of speech, otherwise the only alternative is violence.well shit LOLnew f-word here, who tf is bombjin?

you’re not horrible, you’re just wrong. the immigration act which passed in 1965 that you’re talking about is called the Hart-Celler Act and it wasn’t an “obvious, massive lie”. They didn’t know it would change the demographics of America as much as it did. Destiny had this same talk with Nick Fuentes, you should really go watch it (https://youtu.be/10neTGqaO20). And by the way, 20 years ago was 1997 and im pretty sure no one would care if they had to choose between a Somali or British immigrant.

It's called "[Rape by deception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_by_deception)"im starting to feel like this is all on purpose. she is blatantly covering all of the same talking points that every other Fox News host has made (i.e. Shut up and play, what are you even protesting for, other, better ways to protest). I think she’s seen the attention that these statements gather for who ever decides to say them and she just wants a piece of it. 

we have the national anthem and shit in sports because the department of defense pays for it for the sole purpose of recruiting more people into the army the people at twitter are just a bunch of fucking hypocrites. maybe if Destiny was doxxing mass shooting victims he would still be ok.i agree with both drgaz and thekonzo's postsdamn i didn't know the title was so triggering, maybe i should have clarified it to"as Destiny has started to realize" or something along those lines. My bad, wasn't trying to say Destiny started the trend or anything just that more recently he started saying such things.jesus, how fucking stupid is thorin???here's the 3 min youtube version for those who don't like to read.

The video seemed to partially agree with their world view.The sentiment in the thread was actually fairly positive for that subreddit.Remind me if i'm wrong but wasn't there another case that was also about a handshake.

They can’t ban all of us."I'm not doing drugs for another year. If I go back on this anyone who knows me is allowed to stop me, by force if necessary."

I'm paraphrasing a bit, because I don't remember the exact words, but he said this on stream in front of 2k+ viewers. Mabye. Again, it's been a while, so I don't know the exact words anymore, it might have been shrooms instead of drugs. But if you are as worried as he was about fucking up his brain I'd honestly imagine staying away from drugs altogether for a while.First of all, read the op. Second of all, are those you own definitions or do more than a handful of people actually subscribe to them. Pretty sure that's called ["Tu Quoque"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque)And why do you think Destiny would disagree with this?Yeah, wtf? I never heard a drug user say "I'll never do this again", only to do it again the next week. They're some of the most reliable people we haveExactly, take it from established and well know internet doctor /u/LEDDUDE2 to explain to you the potential negative effects of a prescription drug.How often do you take weed, how often do you think Destiny takes it?Here is a tipp for anyone reading this:

If anyone on the internet ever says "There are 0 negative effects from taking this drug", ignore them. They are either horribly uninformed, or wanna sell you something. Just because [Benzodiazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) is used to combat panic attacks, does not mean they "don't have any health risks" associated with them. The idea that you would ever take someone serious that recommends the usage of a prescription drug, by advertising it as "risk free" is borderline retarded.And again I ask you the second part of my original comment *"are those you own definitions or do more than a handful of people actually subscribe to them"*. 

From what I can gather the term "individuals" is reserved for humans. Also before you can make claims that you can't exclude individuals from a society you first have to prove that animals are a part of society. Again, the term "society" seems to be reserved for humans, at least in the literature that I could find.&gt;You're denying the thought I'm trying to convey based on semantics.

Because your semantics are controversial, so you should expect them to be questioned and have a response ready. The fact that you don't, makes me think you haven't thought this argument through.

&gt;I do not think you can exclude individuals from society based upon their identities

And I don't do this, neither does Destiny, at least by the actual definition of both words. Neither individual, nor society includes animals, the fact that you do, makes these words have entirely different definitions, at which point I would contest that you indeed *can* exclude individuals by their identity.There are many differences between the comparissons you brought up, first and foremost these examples are all limited to humans. I'd agree that it is a failing of society to deny a human personhood. So one way to attack this argument is via "speciesism". An animal is inherently different from a human, therefore it is not a part of society.  

Another point to consider is that you bring up an argument against yourself when citing the denial of personhood as a failure of society. It is indeed true that African slaves where denied their personhood and seen as mere animals, but by this definition members of society must be granted personhood to be granted access to socitey. Personhood is defined as "the quality of being a person" and person is defined as "being an individual human". Again, the argument here would be speciesism.

It seems to me to grant an animal access to society you would first have to prove it's equality with humans. If we asume that animals are inherently different to humans, then we can't consider them part of society by the common definition of the word.It was more a joke than anything else, I am well aware that Destiny is not addicted to neither shrooms, nor weed, or any other substance. I don't think he would ever do heroin, because he is aware of the addictive qualities of it.

I will however say that him ignoring experienced drug users advice and doing an unhealthy amount of shrooms was monumentally stupid by him and the thought that this could happen in the future (Destiny ignoring advice of experts in a field in favor of the experience) is not that far fetched, altough heroin is probably an extreme example and one he more than likely will stay far away from.This is not a political disagreement then. It is a philosophical one. You asume that animals and humans are identical and thus deserve to be granted access to society. If Destiny would agree with this philosophy I'd asume he would agree with you, as he has shown multiple times in the past that he does not discriminate based on race/gender/identity.

When you say we care about the identity, in this case the identity "human", you are presupposing that animals can be individuals, otherwise all individuals are humans, thus there is no "identity human". I reject this presupposition, as I consider animals and humans to be fundamentally different. Thus I do not care about the identity of individuals, because I reject the idea that there is any other identity but human.

To attack this stance, one I think Destiny holds as well (speculation on my part, because I honestly lost track of his actual opinion during the vegan debates) you would have to prove to us that animals can be considered individuals, otherwise both me and him would simply reject the idea that there is an "identity animal".&gt; You won't have any health risks from taking benzos once to combat a bad trip. Like pretty much every drug.

I'll take my own previous advise and ignore you. But for the record this is wrong and if you seriously consider using Benzos, which *doesn't necesarrily put your health at risk*, consult a doctor first. They are prescription drugs for a reason. Do not ever take advise from randoms on the internet about what drugs to put into which orifice.

&gt;Politics is the governance of society. This subject is inherently political.

Our definitions of society differ. This is the philosophical disagreement. We cannot discuss society when we haven't even properly defined it yet.

&gt;I do not assume animals and humans are equal.

Okay, let me explain this to you in as much detail as I can. [Society](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/society) is **by definition** a group of *people*. We can only include non-humans into society if we observe them to exhibit human behaviour, otherwise **the definition of society** prohibits them from being a part of it. If you want to argue for a different definition of society, you **need** to define it. Right now what you are doing is you are using commonly accepted terms with their commonly accepted attributes and redefine them, while wanting to keep the commonly accepted attributes. You cannot do this, this is fallacious as fuck and every intelligent will simply ignore your argument as fallacious. Right now I claim that animals do not exhibit enough human behaviour to be granted access to society. I do acknowledge that they do exhibit *some* human behaviour, but I do not consider it enough to be granted access into society. Since you seem to be making the claim that animals have a right to be granted access into society, something which, **by definiton** only humans have, you either claim that their similarities are big enough, or you're using a different definiton of the term "society", at which point the argument is irrelevant. 

&gt;protected by society.

This is not the same as being a part of society and I would ask you to clearly define what your actual stance is instead of redefining it like this.

&gt;not murdering an individual.

I reject the idea that animals can be considered [individuals](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/individual), as that term is, again, reserved for humans. If you want to redefine it, please do so, otherwise I will argue that it perfectly acceptable for a society that doesn't have a definition to murder individuals that have no definition. For all I know you could include plants and inanimate objects into your definition of "individual"

&gt;I simply think it is flawed to determine acceptance in to society based on an individuals identity and not their actions.

With the commonly used definitions of all the terms used in this sentence, neither do I. With your made up definitions, apparently I, as well as society, does.

&gt;the fact that I was just stating a part of destinies politics

Again, he does not disagree with you politically, he disagrees with you philosophically.https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/NeoDestiny

0% kindness hahaApparently in the same reality in which someone makes claims about prescription drugs having "no health risks" and in the same reality in which this same person advises to take more drugs if the drugs you're currently using have a bad effect on you.  
But please, if this person makes any sense to you, follow his advise. If you want to take the advise of random people on reddit on the correct usage of drugs I have advise for you as well, shoot a gram of heroin and make the world a better place.&gt;I reject your made up definitions.

The definition I provided was from the Oxford dictionary. If you consider that to be a made up definition, I feel sorry for you.

&gt;Individual's etymology clearly describes an indivisible part of an -al greater whole.

Correct. And if your argument is that animals are individuals of the animal kingdom, or individual things, or individual beings, then I agree. However up until this point your argument has been that animals are individuals of a society and since you have provided me with a "correct" definition of individual, but have conveniently forgotten about the second definition I linked I am asuming that you agree that a society by the definition of the term is reserved for humans. The definiton of individual you linked doesn't disagree with my overall point. 

&gt;Society does not decide that all destinies are strippers

Never said that, nice strawman

&gt;Our legal system does not, or at least should not, persecute based on identity.

It should not and noone intelligent disagrees, nice strawman

&gt;To claim that it is up to me to prove that an individual is innocent of all crimes

Never said that, nice strawman

&gt;It is up to you, as the prosecutor

I am not the prosecutor, as animals are things and can therefore not be prosecuted

&gt;to determine if an individual has committed a crime.

A thing can commit no crime, as you said yourself you consider animals to be things, so your argument is moot

&gt;Describe to me what laws animals have broken that warrant a death penalty.

Animals are things, as per your own definiton, things can commit no crime, things cannot be part of a society. Please define your terms better, or I will gladly use the rope you provided to hang you.So you ignore the entire post that calls out your fallacious use of strawmen multiple times only to try and "get me" on a semantics argument? I actually entertained this argument because I considered you to have a bare minimum of intelligence from your earlier comments, sad to see I was wrong.

To entertain your semantics games:

&gt;Are you going to tell me that people are exclusive to everything?

Yes, both legally and morally I consider people aka humans to be exclusive.

&gt;And you're criticising my comprehension of language?

Yes, I do

&gt;People are things.

No, they are not  
[a human being as distinguished from an animal or a thing.](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/person)

&gt;What crimes were committed by the individuals you exclude from society?

I don't exclude individuals from societyI wrote in another comment but I will say it here again, there are people with allergies towards a substance contained in most Benzodiazepine. For these people using these drugs even once can be life threatening.

But regardless of that, my point wasn't to prove this guy wrong, my point was that taking medical advice from people on reddit is dangerous and stupid. You have no clue wether these people have any education, or experience and absolutes like "no health risks" are huuuge red flags. For all I care he could have made an informed and well meaning suggestion, but when you bundle that in wtih blatant false information like that it devalues the entire argument.&gt; Appeal to authority

Alright I'm done. You actually don't know the words you are using. You're just throwing shit at me and hope something sticks. This is not an appeal to authority in any way, shape, or form. I don't even have any idea how you could possibly come to this hillarious conclussion.  
I am giving you the first dictionary link that popped up when I googled "can a person be a thing", because that was such a moronic, idiotic, nonsensical argument that, I admit, it threw me for a loop and I actually had to google if there was some philosophical definition that I wasn't aware of.

My argument is purely semantic because you are making shit up my dude, neither individual, nor society, nor identity, not appeal to authority work the way you use them. You want me to give you a political argument? Fine, here it is:

I don't exclude individuals from society, neither does Destiny, therefore your accusation is baseless. Nope, I did&gt; unless you do a specific allergy test

which is what a doctor would do, kill yourselfYou can get tested for alprazolam  allergy without telling your doctor you are consuming drugs, if you unable to do that, I pity you.

I will also block you, because this conversation bores me. Anyone still taking your advice after reading through this conversation deserves the risk their taking and with a bit of luck some of them might have a alprazolam allergy and we can raise the overall IQ of this world a bit.

Which she still proceeds to defend as "just a not-pc joke from two years ago".We obviously can’t get into DeSantis’ mind so here’s how I’d break it down:



best case- said it totally innocently 


worst case- hard dog whistle 


most likely case- Freudian slip




This most likely case isn’t very good for DeSantis though (assuming he doesn’t want to be perceived as a racist). It doesn’t sound really great to say I have racist thoughts like this and maybe even talk like this in private but didn’t mean to say it here.

This also explains why he values women less. Remember you can salute hitler all you want and if someone tries to stop you you are the good guy. “Good guy” connotes morality. Unless your conception of morality is following the law (which obviously is vacuous, although I can explain if need be) then no the Nazi is not considered the good guy except by other Nazis. Of course if you want to identify as a Nazi you are welcome to call them the good guys.
Arbitrary moral system? So if you watch batman do you see him hit a bad guy and think technically he assaulted the criminal so he's the bad guy. I got caught up in the YouTube Skeptic community, especially during the presidential election. Was pro-Trump, and posted on t_d. Started to embrace ethno-nationalism, anti-feminism, Islamophobia, etc. etc.

I knew of Destiny during the SC2 days, but I stopped following the SC2 scene. I rediscovered Destiny through his debate with JonTron. Admittedly, it took a lot of effort to un-do the influence the Skeptosphere and alt-right influences had, but I'm glad I got out. Whenever I revisit past Lauren Southern, Blaire White, SomeBlackGuy, or Milo videos I'd watch, it blows my mind how extreme and insane their positions were, and I can't believe I got swept away in that.

Before all that, I was a very Left-leaning person.

I find that argument unconvincing considering muslims already have "taken over governments" before.

Also, British muslims already have "taken over" several local governments.My definition of "taking over" is that a government is ruled by muslims, and Islam is codified into law. So yes, they have, I'd argue.The best way to get good at these things is 1) take a job in either these fields 2) get a degree(s) in either of these fieldsYeah, but by then we can blame it on dirty democrats ruining the economy.

How is that not leeching off others?&gt;dunno 

Yeah that's obvious.

&gt;epik defense of communists, kiddie, you tried your best

I'm not defending communists, idiot.Isn't that considered "leeching off others" the present day?Nice try, dipshit! (We can say dipshit, right?)The villages have churches and sell pork. That's all thanksThat's moving the goalposts. First you said no leeching, now it's only "necessary leeching". I don't believe you any longer.Even the image is comical.Where did I defend communists? Please point it out. 

edit: 2 days later and you couldn't point it out. Sad!Sir-man: "Just because i fight with you, doesn't mean I don't love you. Do you love me?" 

David: "I don't even know you."

Also at least in the US (where libertarianism is most present), schools are funded by property taxes I thought.Oh that’s not my argument at all. I actually think it should be happening anywhere. So my argument is basically that just because I think it’s wrong, doesn’t mean they shouldn’t do it. This sort of thinking should be applied around the world but it isnt because of how backwards it’s perceived to be and this is why it’s being called “mutilation” even though the UN has recognized this and has decided it should be addressed as “cutting” going forward.I’m not arguing the definition of the term here. I’m arguing the connotation the word “mutilation” brings when talking about a culture that’s different than yours. I posted this in the off chance that destiny could see it along with my email. im just covering all my bases lolBut that’s where you’re wrong. In some cultures, being cut is a sort of right of passage. I’m also not trying to argue that it’s a good thing to do as you seem to think. All im arguing is that by calling it “mutilation” when you are not apart of the culture is ascribing a “lesser” or “backwards” way to the culture who practices cutting.  This is one of the reasons to not call it mutilation. I haven’t read this article before, thank you.can you name some form of mutilation that’s good? You are the problem. By calling an entire culture shitty and backwards, you are advertently putting that entire group of people beneath you which is a VERY slippery slopedo you honestly not see where you’re headed when u trash another culture? And again, im not defending cutting at all, I think it’s abhorrent. But what I think doesn’t matter to the people who practice it nor it should. you’re arguments are way too surface level dude lmaoMan you’re dense. You do know im arguing from an anthropological perspective, right?  There’s literally no arguing with you if you’re just going to pretend like you’re high roading me like im actually defending the practice. If you want to talk more about this, I would love to chat with you in discord sometime. Let me know.Sure. But it’s not our place (or anyone’s place) to tell them to stop doing something because we think it’s backwards. 

[[[[[again, I am arguing from an anthropological perspective here guys. please don’t act like I condone any sort of violent behavior]]]]]Do you believe that “FGM” is done outside of cultural tradition? Feel like Hasan is going to bring destiny to the world of politics for once, he needs more connectionsYeah, I have some notes im putting together in the off chance that I do get to talk to destiny. Thank’s for the advice buddyNo. Let's not unnecessarily force the meme. It's being spammed enough.Ihatethisomuch back at it again with another dumbass post&gt;reads Kant daily 

Wow, I mean, how much is there to read about a dead philosopher?no? lol im just arguing from an anthropological stand point “badly” seems tame, but yes.this guys gets it Cuz destiny is a nobody in the world of politicsDont worry chuck schumer already did it for you, check out his tweet comparing abtifa destroying a republican's garden to sending bomb threadI would agree with you if I wasn’t arguing from an anthropological view point. I was talking with an anthro grad in the discord after me and destiny talked and he made me realize that we shouldn’t even call it cutting, but rather the term for it in their own culture/language. I have faith this sub will overcome the title, it's not /r/worldnews or /r/futurology.it's almost like he said the U.S as in the U.S imperialism when the fk did anyone say about Hilary is a wholesome candidate, the person just point out how the U.S is a hypocrite for being against something that they cost*insert that tweet about voting for leopard that eat peopleIncels out!Hey can u stop objectify our boi hasan[Just go on Twitter!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igvA7LP6IA8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2901)Oh shit they found out abt the headquarter of the illuminati: broward countyAs long as you dont say "I love you" after you nut, you should be fine. The title of this post isn’t to directly accuse Trump of being a fascist, even though he has fascist tendencies at the very least. It’s to draw attention to the ultranationalistic rhetoric that is creeping its way into every day speech. When he started drawing similarities to WWII documentaries I was like [you’re god damn right.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9RVS8cjNN0)Who is this person? I must learn more about them.Pretty sure bernie is against political violence but nice memeAu contraire Cant wait when its turn out to be a destiny viewer like mmdt or some shitTrainwrecks thinks Jordan Peterson is pretty well spoken, and has point. He doesn't know what that point is but he is pretty well spoken so he agrees with him. Check out the big brain on Brad...Not until we get that pictureOmega Yikes from mewoizers

&amp;#x200B;Destiny cant be tsundere with yellowspoongirlDid anyone screenshot it b4 desTINY destroy all the evidenceSo what would the legal consequences be if this was true? Libel/slander against the Special Counsel seems like it would hold a fair bit of a charge. Obstruction of Justice as well?Wait does he live with his mom like a true capitalist or what?Why is this here?
