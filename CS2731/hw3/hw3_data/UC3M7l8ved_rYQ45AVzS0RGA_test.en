Lets use this thread to discuss when we should all get together and mass tweet Bernie that we want him on the show!
That’s actually what you are saying when you say the news coverage, U.N. reports etc. are all fake. Was Bosnia and Rwanda fake genocides as well?Hey All,

I picked up some tickets to Jimmy Dore for this weekend when I heard he was coming to town, and I didn't realize it conflicted with a previous engagement I had signed up for.

 My poor planning is your win! I've got two tickets to give away to any one willing to drive to Corvallis and pick them up. If you or any one you know is a Jimmy Dore fan and want to go see him this weekend, post here or send me a PM and if you can confirm you or whomever you give the tickets to aren't just going to sell them, they're yours.

Like I said, I can't deliver them, but if you are in the Eugene, Salem, Corvallis, Albany area, it's prob a 40 minute drive. Hit me up with a PM and post here why you want them and we can work out the details.
In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhn89O_Z96M&amp;user=SamSeder) Michael Brooks responds to the indirect charge that Jimmy made against “dumb liberals”.  He argues that Jimmy’s position, that you shouldn’t vote for the lesser of two evils, is silly and impractical.

I think it is useful to us to consider where both of them are coming from in order to stake out some common ground.  Neither Brooks nor Jimmy are completely right here, and they are both letting their egos cloud a bit of their judgement.  But both of these have some insights that we should consider.

I have been watching Jimmy Dore for over a year now.  I haven’t watched much of the Majority Report or Michael Brooks.  I guess I first got to know his current position on Jimmy either through watching one of Sam Seder’s rants against Jimmy, or when he called Jimmy part of the “dumb-dumb left”.

At first I was very put off and thought Brooks was just another alt-media centrist.  But that doesn’t seem to be the case at all.  He is clearly a socialist (he says in the video that we need to end capitalism) and he doesn’t seem to have any of the vices of the establishment liberals, like the liberal identity politics, the tone policing, etc.  So how come they disagree so much?

I think both of them have the right intentions.  I don’t think that Brooks is an ineffectual, dumb liberal, and I don’t think that Jimmy is pandering for clicks (like Brooks heavily implies).  But they have very different backgrounds.  Jimmy is a raw, working-class comedian.  He might seem anti-intellectual, but it’s more that he emphasizes wisdom over bookish knowledge.  He still respects more bookish knowledge and wisdom, as he often defers to people who know more about him.  Brooks, based on the little I know of him, seems to be more of an poindexter intellectual who is socially and pop-culturally savvy.  And he also knows more about practical politics, it seems.

To the degree that they are attacking each other, I think both of them are mistaken.  Brooks puts forth a valuable critique.  I think he knows more about practical politics than Jimmy does.  But he goes too far in his rhetoric.  Maybe Jimmy is “dumb”, but what does it matter?  Jimmy calls himself dumb all the time (maybe too much).  His intelligence is not his virtue.  It’s his passion and his integrity.  I think Brooks is seriously underestimating the good that Jimmy can do with his polemics.  To whatever degree that Jimmy is “dumbing down” the politics, on the whole it’s a minor vice.  Jimmy is serving as a channel into progressivism and even radical leftism.  Brooks shouldn’t underestimate the power of that.
At the present time, the majority of US governors are GOP. Out of fifty states, thirty-three of them are under a Republican. The damage done by them have been immense, pushing and passing legislation that suppressed voters, restricted abortion rights, enriched corporations and punished workers. However, depending on the state you live in, not every Democrat can be trusted. Some potential candidates are quite progressive and support a Bernie or Bernie-esque platform for their state. But others are "bluedogs", or Republicans in a blue suit. Depending on where you live, please choose wisely in who you vote for. Never forget that there's always more than two parties on your ballot in every election, so vote according to your conscience. Disrupt the status quo, but choose wisely. Take to the airwaves, cyberspace, and the streets to promote your candidate and party of choice, especially if it's third party. It's time to shuffle, to make things interesting. Vote, and vote third party, or vote progressive Democrats/BernieCrats!Jimmy's appearance on Joe Rogan:

Cenk's appearance on Joe Rogan:
 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6snP_ZoaZo Jimmy brought up Chris Hedges and how he owned Sam Harris on the topic of the Middle East, but didn't mention Hedges wrote a book titled "I Don't Believe In Atheists: The Dangerous Rise of the Secular Fundamentalist".

Kinda ironic. Don't get me wrong. I agree with Jimmy Dore's goals in terms of neutrality and free speech. But it's important to keep the internet immutable from government interference. The whole thing could easily backfire and end in a [Social Credit Score](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/china-social-credit).

The #resistance wants us to KYC our social media accounts with the government so they can monitor everything we say and do. 

Snowden, Julian Assange and Chelsea Manning have proven how valuable privacy is. Revealing their identities may have been the worst thing that's ever happened to them. I'm sure many would be whistle blowers stay silent, because no rational person would want to be a martyr. Just a tragic life decision.

If you regulate the internet like it's a public square, then there's a legal precedent that there's no reasonable expectation of privacy.

The odds of competing with facebook or google are already bad enough. But if you put social media in the public utility business, then there's no chance of new startups competing with facebook or google. If you want to run a videohosting site or just a web forum, get a corporate lawyer. Breaking up social media companies seems impractical, social media companies by nature will centralize into as few platforms as possible due to the network effect. Making the internet and social media a public utility seems the same, especially in a more and more nationalistic world. Any "internet bill of rights" would have to be enacted on a near-global scale with the internet being borderless, spaceless and all that, any regulation could be avoided just by moving country.

Lastly is the possibility of more ethical alternatives winning over in the long run. I do hope this will happen, but my inner cynic also sees this as a rather impractical option. Like i stated prior, social media platforms seem to centralize down into as few platforms as possible that can provide as much functionality as possible. This is what is most practical for consumers. This, however, ends us up in a situation where there by nature will always only be one major platform of social media which if you want to be on social media, you will have to utilize if you want to interact with people. Yes, a new Facebook could come, but it would only do to Facebook what it did to Myspace, take over the entire market. This on top of the added monetization options tech companies have in surveillance capitalism (the tracking of info) means that ethical alternatives that do not participate in said tracking of info will always be disadvantaged against those that do in creating capital. It has a lot of parallels to Factories in the 18th century, those that employed kids profited more than those that did not.

The future of the internet is decentralised, that i am certain of. However, the giant cynic on my shoulder can't see how this would be implemented. 

TLDR: We're fucked and there is nothing we can do about it.Over 95% of blacks voted for Obama because he was half black. Whereas only about 60% of white people voted for Trump. Yet people are going crazy attacking Trump for racism, and nobody admits to Obama's racism.

Obama did a variety of policies for blacks, like releasing drug dealers out of prison, importing more muslims into the country, taxing white people to pay for black people's healthcare (on average white people pay more taxes and black people are more likely to be uninsured). And fanning the flames of Black Lives Matter that basically wants to stop the police from doing their jobs. Not to mention the continued affirmative action policies that sees less qualified black candidates getting the opportunities every time.

Isn't it about time the country had a president that wasn't so racist?[ Sanctions do not seem to prevent war, and war does not seem to alleviate the need for sanctions. Rather, these two tools of foreign policy seem to be interlocked in a circular formula: sanction, invade, repeat.](https://medium.com/@hardlensmedia/sanction-invade-repeat-the-end-of-americas-foreign-policy-formula-9eaaf9468bcc)... as long as police unions are significantly weakened.Other than her intense focus on Trump (especially Russia) to the near-total exclusion of other topics, what is it about her that warrants such frequent mention by Jimmy and fans?  Did she do something I'm not aware of?   EDIT: Something bad and cannot be said of Chris Hayes, Lawrence O'Donnell, Don Lemon, Anderson Cooper, etc.?  Dumb question; does anybody know what "double c.k." means?  I understand Jimmy makes the 'jerk off' motion when he says it meaning that the person or statement he's referring to is bullshit, but what does it actually mean or stand for?  Also, is it "double c.k." or "c.k. c.k."?  Please, educate my ignorant ass.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.Just curious. I'm also hoping if you can give a link or a way to find it. I've searched on my own, came up empty.

Thanks in advance.Wondering if Jimmy and Cenk could really be friends? Maybe they are just cordial with one another just to keep each other's shows connected and feed off each others subscriber base. I know jimmy records his other show (Agr/Prog) at the TYT studios...But I still wonder if anyone has info on their "real" relationship? P.S. I completely stopped watching TYT because I can't stand any other host/anchor other than Cenk (and even so I've kinda of lost interest in their channel overall). I always come back to TJDS Day-in and Day-out! He really seems to capture EXACTLY how I feel inside. We are definitely on the same page politically. Keep Being You Jimmy!I know It is being done in LA, but I mean is he shooting in his basement? Or in Part of TYT studios? Or Maybe he has his own studio? Not Sure...Anyone know?https://www.reddit.com/r/centerleftpolitics/comments/7btmu3/clinton_fires_back_at_brazile_rigged_claims_that/

Banned for these comments in this thread, unaltered. I knew it was coming, thats the M.O. of these mods, ban anyone who argues from a progressive reformist point of view regardless of whether they said anything offensive or not. (To them being a progressive is offensive enough)

I’m banned from 6-8 political subs now for basically the same thing (one I think was actual spamming, I got a little obsessed asking if people were synths or not, lol, the rest are for having an opinion the mods don’t like.The Trump-Russia story was concocted by the corporate wing of the Democratic Party as a smokescreen to cover their corruption! By covering this story you are giving trump legitimacy when he accuses us of fake news! In [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwRkfddtSPs&amp;user=TYTInterviews) with The Young Turks from 2013, Noam Chomsky argued that Barack Obama was what in the past would have been called a moderate Republican:

&gt; Would have been called,
several decades ago, a moderate Republican.  Kind of a mainstream
centrist with some concerns for liberal ideals and conceptions”.  But
not much in the way of principle or commitment.  And on some issues he’s
pretty reactionary.  Civil liberties, for example.

As Jimmy has pointed out [this is what](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsg0gfNi424&amp;user=LSUDVM) Obama has said about himself (2012).

Writing for The Washington Post, [Ezra Klein](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/obama-revealed-a-moderate-republican/2011/04/25/AFPrGfkE_story.html?utm_term=.13ad74b24dce) made the same argument in 2011.

Someone writing for The American Conservative [has made the same argument](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/obama-is-a-republican/) (2014).If the government gives money to the poor, they will only consume it on things they need, like housing, food, clothes, medical care for old and education for the young. That's not helping anybody in the long run, it's just going to cause inflation, because it's only wealth redistribution it's not economic growth. This is taking somebody else's hard earned piece of pie and giving it to those who didn't work for it. Instead the government should be reducing taxes for the rich, so they have more money to invest back into the economy. That's making the pie bigger so everyone will have a bigger piece in the long run.

Why do you think USA is the number 1 economic power in the world? It's because here people are motivated to work. The need to buy a house, to buy food, clothes, pay medical bills, pay hundreds of thousands in school fees and student loans... ... etc, etc. These are all great motivators to work hard for individuals and great drivers of economic growth for our country. Why do you think China's economy is growing much faster than us? It's because they have a lot more well motivated people in a lot more desperate situations.

You "progressives" really need to think more about the economy, and use your brains instead of crying at every starving baby.﻿ Feeding that baby now will make you feel good and make you look good as if you were occupying some moral high ground. But not feeding that baby will mean everybody is better off, and there will be less starving babies in the future.Here is Thomas Sowell:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGYl17DiEwo**Why Doesn't Socioeconomic News get Covered by Radio and Television?**

I mean outside of News for the Wealthy with a Wall Street slant. Channels like Bloomberg cover economic news, but they'll be just outright giddy over the prospect of thousands of people losing their homes because to them that's an economic opportunity. The plight of people losing their homes means nothing to them.

Why don't we have a Working Class equivalent of Bloomberg that covers what economic developments mean for the rest of us? We used to, once upon a time waaaay back when there was a labor press, we should have a modern version of that but as far as I can tell we don't.

Sure sometimes there are economics related stories that get covered for like 30 seconds, scandals of employers mistreating employees or something like that, but they're barely even a snowcone's shaving off the tip of a mountain sized iceberg.

It shouldn't take some hermit communist going through towns and writing about them for us to hear about what's going on in places like Camden or cities like Crossett, but we never hear about that stuff unless someone basically publishes a book about it first.

No one in the media ever wants to talk about what happened to the factory towns across the Rust Belt for example, or what's still happening in them. Our failure talk about it is a large part of why Republicans have been able to take hold of them and monopolize voters in them, turning once purple states deep red.

We should be having a public discussion about how and why that happened, about what happened to these communities economically and how we need to address these sorts of things moving foward. This should be a conversation in the 'Progressive Youtube Media' at least, but no one seems interested in having this discussion.#TheRealRussiaStoryPlease respond to my argument, point by point. For context, in case you didn’t know, Medicare is government insurance that pays private, for-profit healthcare facilities. A British NHS system is direct socialized medicine with the government directly paying doctors and owning healthcare facilities. Explain why using your own flawed logic, Bernie and Cortez aren’t just giving “crumbs” and aren’t corporatist neoliberals who don’t want socialized healthcare.Why isn't the media, who is frantically dissecting every detail of the Kavanaugh confirmation process, going after Dianne Feinstein?

She withheld Dr. Ford's letter from her fellow Democrats and initially said the incident happened too long ago to be important, and that she'd handled it. (This was in the New Yorker.)

At the Sept 27 hearing, Feinstein was confused about whether she'd asked her staff about leaks. She also stood by silently while the Republicans grandstanded and conducted a sham process with the assistant female prosecutor.

At the end of the Sept 28 hearing, Feinstein was utterly confused about what Flake was doing, and didn't even know what the committee was voting on.

Eariler this week, when some Code Pink activists confronted Feinstein in a Senate hallway asking her to do more to block Kavanaugh, Feinstein told them, "you have my vote, don't lose it," like some kind of threat.

Dianne Feinstein has lost my vote, I am voting for the other Democrat in her Senate race, Kevin de Leon. He is a bit of a corporatist, but he says he is for Medicare for All....and at least he's not Feinstein.It was his live show at a theater in chicago a few months ago and it really struck a chord with me. It was on youtube and now i can't find it. Any help is appreciated thanks!Conspiracy  is real as well as disinformation. It comes in all shapes and sizes. As  much as fake conspiracies like flat earth, lizard people, and the  mandella effect take away from the validity of possibly real  conspiracies, JFK, 9/11, Operation Northwoods, Gulf of Tonkin, etc. It  is important to remember that calling anything other than what it really  is takes away from its validity.  
I have been a listener to the Joe  Rogan Podcast for the past couple of years, and still enjoy the wide  array of guests that appear on his show. After like most people  consuming the new content quicker than it could be produced, I started  from the beginning and started to work my way up to date. I did not   take long to notice that shortly after the Peter Joseph episode, Joe  began more concerned with what other people thought about his ideas  about 9/11, publicly changing his thoughts on the moon landing, as well  as getting upset with his friends admitting that they have disregarded  the law in various ways, as if "someone" who would care about that sort  of thing was listening.  
Some time after that there was a JRE podcast  with Eddie Bravo where he asked Joe something along the lines of, "What  happened to you man? You used to be this crazy moon denier guy.." I once  saw this segment taken from a full episode, and Joe's face said it all  without him speaking a word in response to Eddie's query. Someone,   probably the CIA had spoke with him. Joe's face was a combination of  fear, combined with the panic all while trying to come up with something  reasonable to say quickly. I had seen this video only a couple of  times, and when I tried to search for it again recently it seems to have  been removed (along with with any videos associated with Joe Rogan  being a shill). I would like to point out a couple of things about Joe  Rogan. First he has publicly admitted that he was not that great at  acting, and prides himself on being an honest person. Check out the  middle a 2016 Gaad Saad episode where Gaad is telling a story about a  FBI buddy taking him to the range to shoot guns, and Joe replies yeah I  know "\_\_\_\_\_" he was here last week. At that point Gaad quickly tries to  recover saying and I will not say his last name. All the while Joe  quickly realizes what he has done and grabs his phone texting who I  believe is the person mentioned.  If you have witnessed this moment, you  have seen Joe's honest self shining at its best indicating that he has a  FBI relation. As of recent he has made many public claims on his show  saying that the CIA or government has never approached him in the  passed. All of Joe's bad acting and lying aside, that is just not true.  Mike Baker supposed "ex" CIA operative has frequented the show quite  often. I enjoyed the most recent episode of Mike Baker on JRE where Joe  asked, "Are you glad to be out of the CIA, or is it one of those things  where, your never really out of the CIA?" Mike laughs and says he is not  still affiliated with the CIA. More importantly he laughs in the same  manner that Joe had pointed out in their first encounter, and claimed  "You know when you laugh like that (in response to a question) it makes  you seem like your lying." The truth is in an organization like the CIA  your never really out unless your dead or locked up.  
As  I understand  it Shill in our country means someone who is acting in a manner to  further the various intelligence agencies agenda either under duress or  for money. I think that this is a misnomer and actually takes away from  the validity of what people like Joe Rogan and Alex Jones actually are.  They are CIA and FBI "sources".  Source doesn't necessarily have to be  someone giving information, they can be a tool aiding them in various  investigations, and flushing out people who may oppose these agencies.  The idea that the Government is paying them taxpayer dollars instead of  using fear and intimidation doesn't seem likely. Why pay for something  that they can get for free. Alex Jones in particular is an agent  provocateur, encouraging violent action and up rise against our  government.  I would not be surprised if all of the IP addresses that  frequent Breitbart are logged and targeted, as well as anyone who might  message info wars directly with the plans or ambitions to take one the  government.  
I would encourage people to type in any search engine  "1975 CIA admits to congress using mainstream media to distribute  misinformation". You will find some articles, but the video itself has  been wiped from the "tube" record.  If you ask yourself, why are all  these videos talking down if they are not true? They are taken down  because they are for the most part true. The CIA and FBI do all they can  to protect their sources and practices (which are often illegal and  unethical) and want to influence the public perception away from knowing  that they influence media. If you still have your doubts I would  encourage you further to search for and interview between Jimmy Kimmel  and Mr Robot's Rami Malek. In the interview I am referring to Rami  openly tells Jimmy that he quite frequently has to defer his email to  the CIA. I'm sure there are many other examples like this out there, you  just have to look.  
The FBI and CIA would not allow these programs to  exist  if they did not somehow benefit from them. The FBI has a long  history of using "psychological warfare". Check out an interview where  reporters ask an agent after Waco if they used psychological warfare  against the people in the complex and they did not confirm or deny, but  did say that they would not discuss their practices. I know as of recent  they have used local news media organizations, radio programs (local  and national, as well as Canadian), DOT light up signs, Joe Rogan's  podcast, Tin Foil Hat Podcast, Your Mom's House, the Nerdist podcast,  NPR politics podcast, Geek Squad, as well as the infamous Confidential  Human Sources as tools for this practice. Turning your friends and  neighbors into "Secret" citizens if you will. A nation spying on itself  and getting paid taxpayer dollars to do it.  
After 9/11, matters of  National Security became wide spread and loosely defined. They are  walking a fine line of trying to strip away as much of our right to  privacy as they can with out causing massive uprising, and working with  corporations and their privacy and security policies to do it, that we  the consumer happily agree to with out so much and reading the agreement  or batting an eyelash. Recently a popular online shopping service that  about half the country uses blacklisted all the U.S. based VPN servers  of a certain VPN provider that is not based in the United States and  operates in the jurisdiction of their own country, that does not require  them to keep connection logs. Thus an example where the intelligence  agencies can't make all non-U.S. based VPN services illegal, but can  expose a "vulnerability" in this certain shopping giant's security while  also reaping the benefit of discouraging those shoppers from using  their beloved VPN in order to use those services. For those that make  the  case that a VPN has a single point of failure and the onion router  is the better way to go, having a broader surface to attack seems to be  just as suspect in securing true privacy. The response to blacklisting  the U.S. based servers seems to show part to the governments hand that  the service is effective for the user, and problematic for them. Search  2015 MIT TOR vulnerability. The students were going to expose and FBI  and CIA practice unintentionally  by publicly showing that Tor is not as  bullet proof as most people think. That presentation never happened  shortly after it was announced. Ross Ulbricht the libertarian  administrator of the Silk Road that will probably never walk the street  again as a free man didn't get a fair trial and was a shining example  that the intelligence community as well a judicial system cares more  about protecting constitutional right violating practices rather than  allowing someone a fair trial. This is not the only example of the a  government abusing its power and the majority of people either seem to  hear about it accept it, or just not care, and then the moment passes by  a flicker in the timeline of government corruption.  
If you live in  America you should absolutely believe in conspiracy, we are all in it  together and we are all living in one. If you enjoyed please share, if  you didn't I am sorry. If you are ever given the opportunity to expose a  valid source or practice please do everyone around you a favor and  speak up. These agencies don't care about you or your rights and will  often go to illegal and extreme means to further there investigations or  agendas, so as citizens you shouldn't care about their right to protect  sources and practices (as long as no one gets hurt). Shout it from the rooftops and do your best to starve the beast if you will. Thanks.Would a pure progressive candidate be nice in an ideal world:yes, but we don't live in that world, and the incremental progress that the Dems give us is 1 million times better than the dragging back that the GOP does every time that they are allowed to get control. The current fight needs to be to destroy the GOP and to shatter their base. Every vote should be cast for the candidate with the greatest chance of killing the GOP off. Once the threat to the world posed by the GOP is neutralized, then we rally behind a non-Dem left candidate. When the GOP is reduced to 15% of the vote, then it won't matter how many votes either left candidate pulls from the other, because we will have removed the possibility of a GOP candidate winning. 

Let's say that there are 3 candidates. 1 is GOP and 98-100% opposed to everything that a progressive wants. 1 is a democrat and 30% in agreement with what you want. 1 is an ideal progressive candidate who is 100% in agreement with you. Everyone can acknowledge that the 3rd party candidate is FAR less likely to win than either of the other candidates. This example's 3rd party candidate is to the left of the Dem, and they will likely only be pulling from the Dem candidates voters and not the GOP, thus increasing the odds of the GOP candidate. If we take 100 elections just like this and remove the 3rd party candidate, we can assume somewhere around 50/50 outcomes. Now lets take 100 elections just like this, but give 5-10% of the liberal vote to the 3rd party "pure" candidate. Now we have the GOP winning 55%-60% of the time. Let's assume that that "pure" candidate (in defiance of current reality) wins 1 out of the 100. Congratulations, we get the perfect candidate for 1 term. Let's say that happens in election #40 and then the next 60 go back to being advantaged towards the GOP. The first 39 elections there statistically went to the GOP and the were pushing 100% in the wrong direction, the next 60 elections will statistically go to the GOP and they will be pushing 100% in the wrong direction. That is far too much "wrong direction" for the "pure" candidate to make up for. Now let's assume the "pure" candidate isn't there and that we are at the 50/50 split scenario. In that outcome, we might only move forward 5-10% of the way over the course of those elections since the GOP is constantly dragging us backwards and the Dems aren't moving as far forward as we would like, but that is a HELL of a lot better than moving 60% backwards because the GOP are in control for the majority of the time and the Dems only undo a fraction of the damage that the GOP causes when they regain control.  I'm an experienced news junkie, and I'm just here to say that the Jimmy Dore Show has been killin' it since I discovered it a few months ago. It's a shame that there's only 775 subscribers here. Unless there's like some other community support site somewhere else? People need to be talking about the stuff on those shows. I especially liked the Canadian whistleblower who was on a few weeks ago. That's some seriously dangerous stuff, since it reveals a whole lot about how corrupt people operate. It's a shame there's only a fraction of the people watching this show compared to who watches Maddow or Carlson.This is one of the best episodes, since the Canadian police officer, who went undercover to bust his fellow cops who were being corrupt, was punished by the Canadian justice system, and he explains how it all happened. It shows how corrupt systems in modern democracies protect themselves, so it's actually very useful to people in other nations as well.

Cop Whistleblower Targeted By Canadian Court (Sep 28, 2018) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4ymAaSx2ts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4ymAaSx2ts)[This panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAAZunrTXZM) consisting of Establishment liberals and Kyle Kulinski illustrates the weird bubble that all those liberals (with the exception of Kulinski) are in.  I’m almost halfway through and it’s funny to watch all the standard talking points about how they need to be “pragmatic”, that they don’t need progressive political candidates as much as they need “normal” (read: decorum) candidates, that the superdelegate system just needs to be reformed and not abolished, and so on.  I’ll just describe one of the points in the panel.  

[At 26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAAZunrTXZM&amp;t=26m) the woman on the right brings up a false dichotomy by mentioning how the Democratic Party has abandonded the “white working class”.  This is a completely dishonest move that liberals make: they try to make it sound like _progressives_ only care about the _white_ working class so that they then can argue that progressives are sexist and racist, or that they don’t care about sociological minorities. While in reality progressives care about _the whole_ working class. Establishment liberals know that they are terrible when it comes to economic justice so they try desperately to muddy the waters.  Kulinski corrects her and says _the whole_ working class, but she continues and gets to exactly the point that she was planning to make: that the Democratic Party shouldn’t be just for white people but that, on the contrary, the future of the Democratic Party lies with women and minorities.  Now, to her credit, she didn’t take this dichotomy so far as to suggest that progressives are racist or sexist.  But the “white working class” talking point is completely dishonest since it smears progressives by association.

PS: The Establishment liberals get a  ton of flak from the audience and they are totally on Kulinski’s side.[Website](http://www.policyconference.org/index.asp)

"The AIPAC Policy Conference is the largest gathering of America's pro-Israel community. Through demonstrations of groundbreaking Israeli innovations, keynote speeches by American and Israeli leaders, inspiring moments on stage, and intimate educational sessions Policy Conference delegates experience the full scale of pro-Israel activism in three powerful days. 

The conference culminates with the **opportunity for delegates to lobby their members of Congress in support of legislation that enhances the relationship between the United States and Israel**."
Now bow your head, axcept defeat, and help Hillary Clinton "resist" whatever it is that she "resists." Why would this even be an item on the progressive agenda? 

"Number 16. Give a Christian Corporatist Neocon working for a company that covers up rapes a little more credibility." 

Jimmy is literally going insane; you know he pays a psychic to tell him the future, right?﻿

He even blocked a superchat contributor because they asked him a question he couldn't answer. Total coward. That's why he won't talk to Cenk live about Russia and why he doesn't go on the main show hardly anymore and if he does he's very careful with what he says because he's no longer in an echo chamber. The only reason Jimmy addressed the "conspiracy" smear was because all of his friends saw it so he had to.

Jimmy openly admits he doesn't watch videos critical of him. He had to address the "conspiracy" smear because all of his friends saw it. So how can he expect his criticisms to reach the minds of those he criticizes? In other words he's not do what would reach him. He repeats a lot of the FOX news talking points and spends almost all of his time attacking Obama, Hilary, etc. Does he support Trump?Essentially, my idea is to create a Youtube video essay channel that is the progressive version of 1791L--check it out if you don't know what it is.

I already write progressive, non-partisan political essays but would like to transform my future writings into visually-appealing narrated videos.

At the moment, there seems to be a hole in the market for this type of thing. So if you want to work together and produce something cool, informative, interesting, and challenges the status quo and the insanity of modern American politics, let me know.

P.S. If you want to take a look at a few of my writings and the type of positions I hold, check out my Medium profile: https://medium.com/@ben_johnsonIt's 2:30 and there is still no live stream of jimmy dore, what the f.  Anyone know what's going on?I’ll do immediately it if it’s audio from the YouTube videos. I hope it’s not just jimmys personal phone calls with celebs. The Majority Report has put out [another clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vJ2C43oIDk) complaining about the so-called Dum Dum Left, in particular Jimmy Dore.  I think it’s very unfortunate that there is this big fight between two progressive camps.  I think it’s especially sad that Sam Seder and Michael Brooks are so condescending and insulting about it.  But regardless of who is more at fault, I think it would be better for everyone if we let bygones be bygones and focus on our common ground.  To that end I have a suggestion for refocusing the conversation.

I think people like Dore get very focused on electoral politics to the exclusion of political action that can happen outside of the political parties and the electoral process.  Seder and Brooks might be more savvy when it comes to electoral politics than Dore, but they make a mistake when they solely try to focus on arguing against Dore’s political tactics [1].  Even assuming that Seder and Brooks are completely right and Dore is completely wrong about electoral politics, Dore is too stuck in the electoral politics mind-game to relent on his points.  Which isn’t strange considering his passion; he genuinely wants the country to change radically and thinks that it needs to be done solely through voting in progressive candidates.  So when someone claims that his tactics are counter-productive, he thinks that implies that he has to settle for the centrist incrementalism which Establishment Democrats love.  But if Seder and Brooks (and other anti-Dore pundits) could try to point out other ways to do politics, they might be able to take some of his edge off.  Dore isn’t an opportunist; you can’t fake that kind of passion.  He wants things to change.  But he’s stuck in the mindset where voting strategy is the most important political strategy.  If other people who were advocates for Lesser Evil voting last election could point out political strategies that has nothing to do with the electoral system—activism, protests, building popular institutions, building alternatives to capitalist structures, etc.—then people who were against Lesser Evil voting last election would have other venues to pour their passion into.

Noam Chomsky was a Lesser Evil advocate last election and he thinks that the decision of who to vote for is a [“decision that’s kind of tenth order”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vJ2C43oIDk) (EDIT: although when it came to the last election he probably thought that it was more important than that).  People like Chomsky aren’t famous activists for having come up with great voting strategies, or for providing great analyses about what demographics will vote for which candidates (which is what a lot of political scientists seem very preoccupied with…).  He’s an acclaimed activist for his intellectual contributions.  And he’s only the tip of the iceberg, as there are countless activists who do work that won’t put them in the spotlight.  

Benjamin Dixon claims in the aforelinked MR clip that Jimmy Dore makes people apathetic.  I would be very surprised if that is the case.  As Chomsky has explained, one of the purposes of the propaganda system and our consumerist culture is to make people atomized and politically apathetic.  People who watch Jimmy Dore are most probably much less politically apathetic than most people (although they might be more pessimistic).  People are engaged and tuned in, they want things to change.  Now are you going to berate them for being “stupid”, or are you going to point them towards where they can make a difference?

EDIT: Here’s [another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0n_nWidU24&amp;t=9m3s) video of Chomsky explaining why elections shouldn’t be an activists primary focus.

[1] They also love to bring up the whopping two videos that Dore made about Seth Rich, complain that he’s a conspiracy theorist and make accusations that he is making content “for the clicks” like a cynical money grubber.  I consider all of those bad faith talking points and accusations so I won’t spend any time on them.Two days ago [I made a thread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqthbQWe4tU&amp;t=20m) about how we can move on from the Dore/Seder feud.  I proposed that what the feud boils down to is Dore’s approach to electoral politics.  He has a kind of tunnel vision which makes him focus very narrowly on electoral politics and distracts him from other ways of doing politics.  I suggested that people like Brooks, Seder, and anyone else who agree with them should focus more on discussing non-electoral politics and less on calling people dum dums.

 As luck would have it [Jamie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqthbQWe4tU&amp;t=20m) brought up the topic of electoralism explicitly in the latest video about Dore.  She said that she is skeptical of electoral politics and is in favor of other ways of doing politics.  She said that Dore lacks class analysis.  To which I say… yeah of course.  He’s a liberal.  He hasn’t run in radical circles.  Why would he know about socialist class analysis?  But anyway, it’s good that she brought up the point about electoralism because they got closer to the real crux of the issue which is the fact that Jimmy Dore cannot see politics outside of electoralism.  Brooks picked up on that point and said that, given how pessimistic Dore is about electoralism, his show should be all about direct action, protests and various forms of demonstration.  Yeah, he has a great point about that.Here is how Youtube advertising works: Youtube puts ads next to your videos, these ads generate revenue (the more views your videos gets, the more revenue obviously) **and the Youtuber gets a slice of that revenue**.

Youtube decides how big a slice everyone gets, or indeed, whether you get anything at all. That was the deal from the beginning (so it's inherently a bad deal, but that's a different debate).

The change that occurred (and which Jimmy is talking about) is that Youtube changed its policy in such a way that any video which is analysed to be "controversial" by Youtube's software, is no longer allowed to generate revenue (technically speaking, the algorithm removes the video in question from the giant pool of advertised-upon content. https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/youtube-demonetization-controversy-explained/ )

Youtube claims that it is just trying to prevent Youtubers making money off hate speech and terrorism and such. But, as it turns out, it is very easy for any political video to be caught in this "controversial" filter. Especially for political videos which espouse views or political language that can be considered going against the mainstream or going against the politically dominant opinions. 

In practice, therefore, lots of videos that are politically progressive have been demonetized. Not all of Jimmy's videos have been demonetized (as others have pointed out) but a big chunk of them. Meaning he gets much less revenue from Youtube than before the policy change.Anyway, sincere congratulations on joining the Jimmy Dore patreon club. Money well spent.The episode linked to above is the one about **William Walker**, who was one of those douchebags who went around Latin America claiming land all the time. 

Walker: *"Mine! This piece of land is all mine now! That bit over there, also mine. People who were already living here: you may start addressing me as 'The President'! Also English is the only acceptable language now..."*

Locals: *"Que?"*Also co-hosted by GaryAbsolutely! I did not intentionally shortchange Gareth (he hates being called Gary :) ), I just wanted to keep the title short and to highlight Dave because he is the one who has been a guest on many Jimmy Dore Show episodes. Gareth is a very fine comedian but Dave is the strongest link to this sub.h/t u/Praxxus This lady is insane she literally believes in chem trails and shit like that. Her page is a bunch of kooks who the the fires in California were set by the government with lasers.Our entire system is morally bankrupt and irreparably corrupt. Our only recourse is for our three corrupt branches of government to check one another, or for the media to expose the corruption. However, now that our situation is that all three branches of the government and the mainstream corporate media are largely complicit in tyrannical actions, e.g. mass surveillance, Citizens United ruling, mass incarceration, War on Drugs, pillaging of resources, austerity, imperialism, perpetual warfare, etc, we need to quit being reliant on government to police itself, or the media to inform us.

We must transcend this thoroughly broken system or radically reform it to the point it is unrecognizable from its current form.Hm, not sure. Doing a search for "Awan" on TJDS's channel throws up this video first: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Rwy0pDeJLnc

Yes, and everyone else too.was hopeing for my sensibility to be questioned.

but no this guy is just a cunt.  i would blow him off too.

props to the rational national.This is incredible marketing for the majority report. Whoever your marketing guy is buy him a steak dinnerDoes it need Sam Seder? Probably not. All his left-punching to increase his viewership merely annoys, and Jimmy is smart enough to ignore Sam's provocations. Jimmy can be relied upon to punch up, not down.I would say no, but he is a good asset to have! Although I think he is dead wrong about how to get the progressive policy agenda accomplished! The way to do it is to take over the Democratic Party not shoot yourself in the foot by trying to start a 3rd party! Here is a list of threads in other subreddits about the same content:

^^Now ^^you ^^can ^^remove ^^the ^^comment ^^by ^^replying ^^delete!If you are asking whether or not they had sex, the answer is yes, but Cenk always assumes dominant position so people can't assume he is gay, and Jimmy occasionally likes to wear nice clothes.ahhh, Ok. No inside info here, but I get the same vibe from them when they're on TYT.He called Cenk a cuck fairly angrily once on air and the clip got scrubbed from the internet. But Jimmy was pretty upset back then at cenk for all the rim jobbing he was giving shillary. I think he likes him personally but doesnt have any respect for him politicallyCenk was playing Russia boogeyman (I am going to assume not by choice).  He was reporting on the DAPL girl who had her arm blown off from the water cannon's of the police.  Cenk said it was terrible, especially with Russia and the world we live in.  I almost threw up in my mouth.  This was not the same guy.  It's our job to prove to the establishment mouthpieces we call the media that it is not about the person.  Even if we like them, if they're actions do not reflect the message, they will not be supported.  Thanks for head's up. I found a youtube vid of the speech. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5UxAmkJ6hM The title of the video is "Together in Brussels | "The Neoliberal Economic Model is Broken" Jeremy Corbyn"&gt;Obama’s poor relationship with Wasserman Schultz was widely known and written about, but he left her in the job for six years regardless.

Author seems to not have connected the dots that Obama put DWS in at chair of the DNC for Hillary. Maybe he just doesn't want to die on that hill. Jimmy is America's greatest newsman.Jimmy has learned a great deal from Cenk - mainly, how to grow his audience. So credit where credit's due, also for giving Jimmy a wider platform. Well done Cenk.

Politically speaking, however, I'd pick Jimmy over Cenk 999 out of 1000 times.Huh? Socialism is such a poorly used term its kind of meaningless. The only non capitalist country on earth is north korea. We need more social programs that benefit society instead of croneyism and corruption. We have socialism for the rich and powerful in america we need it for the middle class and poor instead. Good question. Not something that has ever been mentioned on air, IIRC, not even on the Premium/Patreon-only videos. Though if it ever drops then it will be on the latter since those are occasionally chit-chat about the production side of the show.

It is definitely not a TYT studio, that much is for sure. Nor is it in their private home, I think. And we know that they upgraded it with the Indiegogo fundraiser last year, which suggests that it is a small studio they own./r/politics is toxic, they have no issue that the house democrats and the senate democrats both voted for the $700 billion defense budget. Always follow the money.Wow. You didn't even say anything that 90% of people don't agree withI agree, but usually the mods there seem at least somewhat fair.  What reason did they ban you for? Is it temporary or permanent? I've gotten temp bans, but it's cus I insulted another user. temp ban.  3 weeks.  im assuming its because of this. 
&gt; You are a fucking shill!Did anyone else notice what happened the day after Donna B. spoke out? There were a ton of posts when filtered by new and rising, all with real comments. As soon as any got anywhere near the front page, they were down-voted to oblivion and would have zero points. How sick is it that the media pays companies to push narratives in certain subreddits?Damn 3 weeks is excessive but yeah, calling users shills is against their rules lol. Which sucks because, we'll, there have got to be a ton of shills manipulating their front page. I liked when the redditor called the DNC "the left". LOLI know right.It changed during the general.  After Bernie and leaks they cracked down on the internet, hard.  Then one day, about 2 weeks before the general, I saw the r/politics and r/news' front pages and they were a full 24 for 25 Trump is bad articles.  Once the higher ups got wind we were using Reddit to pass along information, they filled it with bots and links.  Now I gotta look at that damn WashPo ad every time I want to click forward. &gt; Now I gotta look at that damn WashPo ad every time I want to click forward.

Doesn't Adblock Edge make it invisible? Though you still have to click through the empty space IIRC.lol indeedmy ban is for calling them losers...  had to look it up. I also called them divisive fools.    21 days and my next ban is permanent.  then i called the mods tools.

&gt;&gt;really? appeased us? do you remember who they replaced her with. your divisive fools still making excuse and pointing fingers. your banking on trump making the next mistake instead of improving yourselves. losers.Yep, welcome to the paid political operative infiltrated Reddit jungle. This doesn’t happen organically with Reddit’s demographics and the mood of the country. This is astroturf culture. I’ve been trying to tell people a long time without much traction, and my guess is until we get some massive leak from one of the big opinion manipulating political action groups everyone will continue to ignore what in your gut you know is true. r/politics isnt the only one. I got banned from r/progressive for being a progressive lol.Was just talking about that in r/centerleft or whatever it is. Ofc downvoted into oblivion, the fact that a sub that lists the 3rd way as a model for thier views can get 1000’s of upvotes with less than a few hundred subs should make it pretty obvious whats going on.

edit: Looks like its r/centerleftpoliticsreading that sub I get the impression it's set up by the same folks that brought us /r/neoliberal and /r/the_mueller.       
If the people who advised Hillary's online presence in her '16 campaign set up sub reddits these subs are what I'd imagine you'd get.         
Smarmy hack retreads of successful subs, filled with cringey attempted clap-backs by tin-eared paid consultants.       
Safe to say i'm not a fan lol.Ya, and I’m not upset I got banned, I know the way these guys operate, just wanted to point them out. Sad thing is I’ve gotten banned from r/progressive for similar comments, and r/politics is the same. So theyre taking over not just these obvious subs but ones labelled as if theyre on our side when theyre anything but. Jimmy Dore stuff isn’t reqlly even allowed on r/politicalrevolution though they seem more hesitant to just ban you there but still its become a place where criticizing the DNC isnt allowed to be a major focus, its a unity sub now. Anyway, I just wish people would recognize it more and try to do something about it.
i posted this same thread on r/theyoungturks and am now permanently banned for [brigading?](https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/9ym0py)"Objectivity is dead." - Abby Martin

What a great quote. I studied journalism/media history in college and learned that it was corporate advertisers that pushed the concept of having two sides to every debate (in order to keep a larger audience to market stuff to). There is a thing called fact, and if you present lies as equal to truth, we get a completely debased society.Most so-called journalists will say whatever you pay them to say. Since that is the status quo of journalism right now, I’d say Abby Martin is more dangerous to journalism, in its current state.

Her blatant regard for ethics is disruptive. There is no room for the righteous in the field of journalism. Abby Martin is undoubtedly a real problem for the corporate driven, sell out media. 

We should be eternally grateful for badass extraordinaire Abby Martin for being one of the very few willing to stand up to the machine."the left" as in center-right at best .I'm walking through your streets

I’ll take Jimmy Dore over Seder any day or night and 10 times in Sunday. Seder is an establishment herder, his job is to get the real left progressives to concede thier positions and vote the lesser of evils (giving up any leverage they have to reform nomination processes and campaign funding). He apologizes constantly for the edtablishment and whenever anyone challenges his strategy/conclusions he becomes hostile, makes an incredibly infantile emotional argument and belittles whoever he happens to be disagreeing with.

Dore is right, and I disagree in the idea that Hillary would be a better president. Trump has gotten very little done that Hillary would not have also done, and we would likely be more aggressively deployed militarily already. Hillary would have attempted one grand bargain after another to prove to the Republicans how much she always wanted to be one of them. The left would have fallen largely asleep and there would be few justice dems, few dsa candidates ect. Trump is a fever we need to clean out our government. Its someone ugly like Trump or full on revolution because we are just going to be slowly strangled to death by the two party boa constrictor otherwise.Attention everyone after watching this video if you don't feel the need to share it then i don't know what where doing as progressives. This video is not monetized just so everyone knows this is not something to make money on. Videos like this are some of the most important videos to share in out fight to win as progressives. I am starting to lose a little faith on how strong this progressives movement is i hope i am proven wrong and it is as strong as people say.You disagree that she'd be a better president?

Well you're just stupid enough to be a Jimmy Dore fan then. Fuck that guy. Go Jimmy goUgh, I’d say Abby Martin is more dangerous. She’s happy to be a Russian stooge and stir up the American people for THEM. I guess some people can’t see that. Notice how she only reports about wrongs the US and their allies have done. Never reports on the numerous things Russia and their allies are up to. Who is David?  This is a Jimmy Sub.  He says the left has split into fractions which is destructive.  They always say party unity, until it comes to voting for the budget, and sending weapons to the Saudis.  Party is always important when its us, and never when its them.  Why?  Because they are playing us.  
We'd probably be at war with Russia now. Strange how we didn't have an option to vote for anyone who would be willing to close foreign bases and stop one of the seven wars we're currently involved in.Absolutely. The "too many factions" notion is a ridiculous view. It's just an echo of centrist propaganda and Democratic party establishment propaganda.  If anything, we don't have enough factions in politics because establishment Democrats and establishment Republicans seem to agree on everything that matters (like on the Saudis, as you say).All this Left-punching in a vain attempt to increase the viewership of centrist shows like MR and Pakman is retarded. Jimmy is smart to completely ignore these guys. They can say what they want about him, but it's not worth acknowledging by anyone.Abby Martin is a good person.  I like Abby Martin.As a side note, I apologize for becoming the 421st subscriber to r/jimmydore - I'm happy to be here, but it doesn't feel good to break that *extremely appropriate* sub count. Cause it has to be one or the other right? Yes, it does have to be one or the other. Choose a side; it’s ok to criticize the U.S., but if that’s all you do without criticizing everyone else I find that pretty suspicious.But not CNN. Cause they're the good guys trying to help us beat the Republicans. This is the lie you can't see.  In fact, they actively work to keep us divided and afraid.  In a Hitchhiker's sense? Nice.
This is my attempt to try and drum up so some support for amazing progressives from brand new congress and justice democrats. This a inspirational type video now i am not a pro at doing this type of stuff actually far from it. Anyways i hope people enjoy it. And lets do this people lets take the country back.Wow. For a second I was shocked this was on my feed, then I realized oh yea /r/jimmydore.

Cause /r/politics and /r/news is a fucking cluster fuck this week.Because corporate cable networks don’t care about the rest of us.What? So we can end up back at the train station courting corporate democrats again?

You know who would be the ones having sex over your body as they brainwash you.I’ve been saying this all month. https://theintercept.com/2017/12/04/elizabeth-warren-challenges-democrats-deregulating-wall-street/E X A C T L YYou guys realize that Sam Seder hates Jimmy right? Seder was fired unfairly but he’s a major douche regardless, constantly punches left as he tries to get a mainstream gig.I pretty much agree.  Seder was fired for a bullshit reason but I have little sympathy for Seder.he told a shit rape joke.  if it was funny i might have sympthyHey everyone made a video on Alexandria who i am sure you all know and love just wanted to share thanks

&gt; In the House, after hearing from many of his constituents on the issue, Rep. Mike Coffman became the first Republican to ask Pai to delay the vote and allow Congress to hold hearings on the issue, while Rep. Mike Doyle vowed to introduce a bill after the FCC&amp;#039;s vote, to roll back Pai&amp;#039;s new net neutrality policy.

&gt; Pai has proposed repealing Obama-era net neutrality regulations which prohibit Internet service providers from discriminating against web content.

&gt; In recent days, Pai has been dismissive of net neutrality supporters&amp;#039; concerns over his proposal, calling dozens of consumer advocacy groups and the City of New York &amp;quot;Desperate&amp;quot; after they sent him a letter about the vote last week.

&gt; With his latest tweet, clearly implying that a United States senator would trade sexual favors for campaign cash, President Trump has shown he is not fit for office.

&gt; Last October, Trump suggested that he never would have groped Jessica Leeds on an airplane decades ago: &amp;quot;Believe me, she would not be my first choice, that I can tell you.&amp;quot; Trump mocked another accuser, former People reporter Natasha Stoynoff, &amp;quot;Check out her Facebook, you&amp;#039;ll understand.&amp;quot; Other celebrities and politicians have denied accusations, but none has stooped as low as suggesting that their accusers weren&amp;#039;t attractive enough to be honored with their gropes.

&gt; He is enthusiastically supporting Alabama&amp;#039;s Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, who has been accused of pursuing - and in one case molesting and in another assaulting - teenagers as young as 14 when Moore was a county prosecutor in his 30s. On Tuesday, Trump summed up his willingness to support a man accused of criminal conduct: &amp;quot;Roy Moore will always vote with us.&amp;quot; Trump apparently is going for some sort of record for lying while in office.

*****
&gt; As the former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan recently warned, years of highly unorthodox monetary policy by the world&amp;#039;s major central banks has created a global government bond bubble, with long-term interest rates plumbing historically low levels.

&gt; At the same time, housing bubbles are all too evident in countries like Australia, Britain, Canada and China, while interest rates have been driven down to unusually low levels for high-yield debt and emerging-market corporate debt.

&gt; One reason for fearing that these bubbles might soon start bursting is that the years of low interest rates and avid central bank government bond buying that spawned the bubbles now appear to be drawing to an end.

Just wanted to share an amazing progressive i am sure you all know and love. By the way Jimmy is narrating the second half of the video I agree their both corrupt but there is no Trump-Russia story but there is a Clinton-Russia story! Probably because he lives on the other side of the country but I hope he comes here someday! I'd love to see him preform live there!They are releasing a tour schedule sometime in January I thinkWhat are you talking about?  Israel is a pariah on the left due to their trampling of Palestinian rights and militaristic stance and the whole idea of state-favored religion.  Jimmy is just following the wisdom of the crowd on this.  I've not seen him say anything especially anti-jewish in a bigoted sense at all.there has never been a palestinian people ever.  they just want to spread islam and are pissed jews are there.  whats the difference between you anti israel progressives and nazis?  jimmy dore needs to stop the anti semitism immediately.  the jews have suffered enough throughout history.  the entire middle east wants to destroy israel and jews are just defending themselves.  should the jews just let the muslims slaughter them?Were the Nazis bad because their victims were Jewish or because their victims were human?  If you can't tell the difference between us and Nazis, then I have to conclude you believe the former more than the latter.jews are a very small minority in the world.  the nazis crimes were far worse because the victims were jewish, a TINY minority in the world.  there are billions of muslims, and a few million jews in the world.Why does /u/kulltsb hate black people so much?Hasbara troll much ? Jews do not equal Zionists for the thousandth time . Hey everyone just wanted yo share an amazing progressive candidate i am sure most of you all know Amy vilela hope you all enjoy As we all know. Obama himself admits this. reducing taxes on the rich has been proven to do nothing for economic growth, and the proof isn’t questionable.  Since Reagan trotted out trickle down economics in 1980, income inequality has only deepened.  Rich people don’t invest this extra money in new jobs, they squirrel it away in banks or stocks, neither of which do squat for working Americans.  

If you want a strong economy, the consumer class must have money to spend back into the economy.  If they are spending all of their money on basic survival, they aren’t buying fancy consumer goods (new cars, phones, toys, gadgets, etc..).  Paying people more money for their work doesn’t cause inflation, it causes spending growth, which is the one thing that every single economist in the world agrees on.  

Seriously, look into some critical reviews of trickle down economics, read it like you’re doing research to prove your point, don’t go to the same tired sources that back up your claims, try looking at the opposition and then try to get a grip on reality, and not some proven false narrative fed you by FoxNews or the Wall St Journal.  

Yes!  Maybe we can have every road be a toll road that is owned by a different corporation.  Can you say police and fire insurance?  A small handful of people could be making a killing, literally.  How about coin slots for kids lockers?  Those kids go to those lockers several times a day, taxpayers should be getting their money back!Is this supposed to be a joke? I've talked to pro-capitalism conservatives and they had real arguments and actually logical and compelling reasoning to back their arguments up. You just sound like a failed troll, trying to troll people on a topic that you aren't well versed in at all. All I do is learn about the economy, it’s just absolutely revolting that, Academic economics has been a field like if biologists  denied evolution.  The worlds leading economists don’t know shit about their own field. They are Marxian-deniers.
[YOU REALLY NEED TO THINK MORE ABOUT THE ECONOMY.](https://youtu.be/T9Whccunka4)This video is has more economics education then he’s probably ever knew existed. https://youtu.be/T9Whccunka4No. I'm entirely serious. I'm not even the only one who think this. My economist friend goes even further in saying compulsary work camps for the poor would be a good thing. We are well educated people, who took economics courses at university for easy credit, and most of us have qualifications in financial services.It's not that simple. The reason why recently republicans are so bad on the economy is not because they reduce taxes, it's because they decrease public sector investment and at the same time take on a lot of debt to fight wars abroad. Also the republicans reduce spending on education and infrastrature, and even privatise education and infracture like water and electricity, that's terrible for long term growth.

But my original point is not about that. I was saying:

1) Poor people consume, rich people invest. Investment in producing goods and services makes the pie bigger, increasing the demand for consumer goods without investment in increasing production will only cause inflation.

2) Desperate people are better motivated to work harder, do unpaid overtime, take any job they can get, etc. The more desperate people there are to exploit, the faster the economy will grow, provided there is enough capital to keep the investments going.

3) Letting some poor people die of starvation / lack of medical care / other horrible causes, is an innevitable part of capitalism, and it's better to let them die rather than help them through government policy that redistribute wealth. Because there will always be poor people, so it's best to give them some incentive to make money (i.e. avoid dying) rather than let them rely on handouts. This will grow the economy faster.lol. I don't just support cutting taxes to incentivise private sector investment, I also support reasonable borrowing to increase public sector investment in education and infrastracture. You should read Mankiw for the basics and Friedman for the good stuff. The guy you linked only talks about specifics. Has he not realized yet the core question is simply "at what level of exploitation will the economy grow the fastest?".

It may like some kind of moral high ground to say stop all exploitation until you realize that will ruin the economy. There needs to be some balance between keeping everybody at subsistence level of living and 1 family having all of the wealth, and equally splitting all wealth between everybody so nobody has incentive to do work. I think keeping 90% of the country unable to fully pay for education, healthcare, a house, and other living costs, and 9% of the country able to cover those things and maybe even an extra house or two but not much more, and 1% of the country having all of the remaining wealth... ... That's about what a good aspirational society looks like."If the government gives money to the poor, they will only consume it on things they need, like housing, food, clothes, medical care for old and education for the young. That's not helping anybody in the long run"  I thought this was a joke post until I read the rest of the amateur economic observations.  No, you are the one that's totally mistaken here. You let this equilibrium slight far far far to the corporate oligarchic right and a reckoning is due. It will be bloody and it will be messy and it will herald a very sharp and sudden correction back to the left. You better get used to that idea.There is literally zero empirical evidence for your point of view. You do realize that, right, comrade? Just checkin'.

Hey, if you give the rich a tax break, evidence says that they do nothing with it. They put it into a Swiss bank account, or they might buy an additional Ferrari with it. Maybe. In any case, the buying of the additional Ferrari only ever benefits Italian workers (kinda, sorta) not local ones.

If you give the poor a tax break, or a handout, they will spend it instantly and locally. They have to. On burgers or something else like that...something they really do need in order to survive. And that does actually stimulate the local economy, don't you know.&gt;It may like some kind of moral high ground to say stop all exploitation until you realize that will ruin the economy. 

This is capitalist propaganda.  Fundamentally wrong.This is how capitalism ultimately turns into fascism. Welcome to 1929 Germany everyone. Get ready for hyper inflation.We live in the most prosperous era in human history, with the best opportunities for social mobility. What would you rather have instead? War? Revolution? Collapse? Plague? Because that's the 4 things which will reduce the inequality. Don't you know how much worse each of these things are compared to the world we live in?! Stop wasting your time on this socialist nonsense. Let the wealth flow to the top, and worry about how you can get to the top.It's simple supply and demand. Giving money to the poor is only increasing the demand without expanding the supply, it won't help anybody, all it will do is drive up prices. You know those starving people you (don't) see on TV in Yemen, Somalia, or a just few blocks down the road from where you live? With your socialism that's what the entire country will become.No. I don't want fascism. The current system is just fine, we've never had it so good. It's you socialists pushing the Democrats further to the left and driving the middle voters towards the alt right, that's what will give us fascism.If you have capitalism, human nature as a mass of people naturally goes to fascism. If you give the rich power they use it to promote authoritarian political control through propaganda tactics. again I want you to look at Germany’s history. Capitalism + Time = Fascism can't tell if you're a psychopath or if this is satirewhat a bunch of pussiesSorry I don't live in a country where people have given up and where affluence has gone full cancer. And yes, I'd rather see everything burn than this go on for much longer. My solution? Maximum incomes. 

I think the US is gone. It's beyond repair. But then again I live in Northern Europe, i.e. "the civilized world". 

You suffer from stockholm syndrome.&gt;This is taking somebody else's hard earned piece of pie and giving it to those who didn't work for it. Instead the government should be reducing taxes for the rich,

People shouldn't get money they didn't earn? Fine.

Then we need to make the rich pay for their own externalities instead of profitably foisting their own externalities against the poor and dwindling middle class.

Or, are you one of those people that thinks corporations (aided by corporate Democrats and the GOP) should continue privatizing profits and socializing losses?

&gt;You "progressives" really need to think more about the economy, and use your brains instead of crying at every starving baby.﻿

You "conservatives" really need to think about the big picture, instead of crying at every expenditure for corporatists.

&gt;Feeding that baby now will make you feel good and make you look good as if you were occupying some moral high ground. But not feeding that baby will mean everybody is better off, and there will be less starving babies in the future.

Yep, sociopathic behavior against the poor will fix everything in the long run, huh?Absolutely not. Everybody should pay taxes. But what is a fair rate? Wouldn't it be fair if everybody paid 20%? After all 20% of 300k is still a lot more than 20% of 30k, so the higher income will still be paying higher taxes. But we don't have that, instead we have a "progressive" tax rate that punishes success. That's fine too, to a degree. It's paying a little extra for a stable society where the people across the river don't come and burn down my house because they have nothing to eat. (I'm talking about the police and security, not about feeding the homeless.) But Jimmy is talking about 90%+ tax rate, he's talking about maximum income, and he's talking about how much he hate this rich person or that rich person because they have a lot of money. That's crazy talk.

You folks have pushed the Republicans so far to the alt right, I'm not even "conservative". Maybe by 1950s standards, but not today. I genuinely support Hillary Clinton, because she have come from an ordinary background and worked her way to the top, despite all of the sexism and prejudice. Hillary is a very smart woman who has learned how the game is played and she played it brilliantly, and I hate it how people resent her for it just because they are themselves losers at the game.Right, you think the US is gone just like the alt right nuts over here think Sweden is gone because of muslim immigrants. All that "alt reich" rhetoric about muslims burning politicians is [proven Trump shitholery](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42671283).

[You are spectacularly deluded to the point of mental retardation](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/01/who-cares-about-inequality). 

&gt; Absolutely not. Everybody should pay taxes

You obviously don't even have a basic understanding of what I’m talking about.  I'm not talking about taxes, I'm talking about paying for externalities.

&gt;I'm not even "conservative". Maybe by 1950s standards, but not today. I genuinely support Hillary Clinton

Yep, you're a conservative neoliberal.

&gt;You folks have pushed the Republicans so far to the alt right,

That's delusional.  Progressives pull most of the country to the left while corporate Democrats and their liberal supporters alienate the rest of the country and either push them right or towards apathy and out of the process entirely.

You are the problem.

&gt;I hate it how people resent her for it just because they are themselves losers at the game.

I despise Hillary because of her various political choices.  The End.Lol. Externalities?! Do you think the New York Billionaires club eat the same food as you? Drink the same water as you? Breath the same air as you? Travel by subway like you? Live in the same kind of estate near an industrial plant like you?! You must be delusional. They are paying more for it than you by funding the government through taxes, but at the end of the day you are talking about problems that doesn't affect them. They are not living in the same world as you.

I don't even know what you progressives are trying to achieve with all these crazy protests. You hate anybody who gets ahead in life so you try to pull everybody down to your level. Hillary got ahead, you try to pull her down. Obama got ahead, you try to pull him down. Pelosi got ahead, you try to pull her down too. Who's next, Oprah?

The occupy movement? Occupy my ass. How about you try working a little harder everyday and try to get into that 1% instead of crying for handouts like a welfare baby. Abolish the minimum wage, open the borders to immigrants, cut welfare, cut corporation tax, cut the red tape, and crush the unions. Let's have a little competition in this market, and let the best rise to the top. And if you don't like it, it's no use going to Wall St to live like a bum, get out of the country and give up your citizenship, plenty of people are only too happy to take your place.&gt; Externalities?! ... They are paying more for it

If you think the rich are paying more for the externalities they create instead of the poor and middle class, you're terribly misinformed.

When corporations underpay workers - it's the poor and middle class that suffers and pays for all the externalities that surround that dynamic.  Just one example of many is the various costs of higher crime in poor and middle class communities due to economic oppression.

When corporations pollute - it's the poor and middle class that pay with their very own lives by living in polluted areas (not to mention paying taxes for cleanup as well).

Please educate yourself:

&gt;I don't even know what you progressives are trying to achieve with all these crazy protests

Yep, you do seem pretty clueless about it, that's for sure.

&gt;You hate anybody who gets ahead in life 

http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/skeptic/arguments.html#straw

You are a pretentious twat.

I've worked with and consulted for Fortune 500 companies over the course of decades, kid.  I worked in the headquarters of the bank that started Capital One.  What's in your wallet?

I despise massive wealth inequality that's spurred by corruption, sloth and ineptitude. If you think getting ahead in life is fine if it's achieved by cheating others then you're a fucking sociopath.

&gt;Occupy my ass.

That can be arranged.

Megalomaniacs plunder society and call it "success". Their dirty secret is they know damn well if they paid for just a fraction of the externalities that they profitably thrust upon the rest of society (especially the poor), they'd be upper middle-class at best.

Dolts like you that celebrate the absolute narcissistic sickness of megalomania are part of the problem. It's one thing to be successful and make a good living, it's quite another to plunder society for vast wealth and be a net loss against society for your own gain.

Yeah, we're coming for people like [Tom Perkins](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/tom-perkins-liberal-war-one-percent-kristallnacht). Not to kill him, but to kill his sickness, his kind of megalomania that takes and takes and takes from society while serving a doctrine of depravity, inbred ineptitude, willful ignorance, sloth, purposefully obtuse corruption and despicable, undeserved power. The narcissistic, megalomaniacal, hoarder sacks of shit that put money before humanity are our enemy.

Keep crying, weaklings.... it's more fun that way.
 Uh, huh...

Let me know when they get to even a fraction of the way towards the number of times the United States has done the exact, same thing and worse to far more countries.The rich pay more for it, because they don't need to be paying anything for it. Whether they create the problem or not is not as relevant as the fact that it's not a problem that affects them. They can pollute your water then go and buy water from where ever the water is unpolluted. They can contaminate your food chain then go and buy food from where ever the food is safe. They can fill New York with smog then go and live in the Hamptons. When an industrial plant leaks, you get fucked, they move away. That's the power of money.

It's interesting you should mention personal experiences of wealth. Looking around at the people I know, there is zero correlation between wealth and hard work. The wealthiest group are the ones who happened to have bought real estate in areas that happened to have risen in prices by over 50 times in the last decade. Followed by people who have done whatever it was that they did, and traded derivatives with absurd leverage ratios, and made a fortune from it. Followed by people who were fortunate enough to have come from good families that gave them private education and paid their college fees and even paid the downpayment for their house, so they have a good professional career and some investments in real estate that brings in rent or in stock market that brings in dividends. And lastly are the vast majority of my highschool classmates who graduated at age 16 and have been working very hard ever since, in jobs that pay criminally low wages and often expect them to do more than they are supposed to. Even though they are on some crappy contract that says they have no rights, no benefits, no pension, no healthcare, and are officially employed by some third party contractor so they can be fired at any time for any little thing. Yet they are reminded that they are the lucky ones compared to those classmates who are currently unemployed and have to give up their dignity every two weeks at the welfare office and be scorned by the rest of society for their "laziness". The irony that my house and my car are built by and still maintained by the hard work of people just like that, and my clothes and other things are produced by people on the other side of the planet who are in even more desperate situations than that, but I make a better living than them while doing less work, that irony is not lost on me.

This irony is life. Accepting it is a part of growing up. There is always going to be inequality in the world, and that inequality is going to increase not decrease. You have to realize that your life is made by your decisions so you have nothing to complain about. You can not blame someone else for exploiting you. What you should do instead is think about what did he do differently to you so that today he is the master and you are the slave? Would you have done what he did or would you have lived your life just the same? If you are not willing to do what he does, then that is your decision to live your life this way and not that way, so how can you blame him for your own decision? For example, when I first heard about bitcoins it was worth less than $20, and I wanted to convert my entire net worth into bitcoins. But before I did that I had a long discussion with my economist friend who was working in currency trading at the time, and he strongly advised me against buying any bitcoins. So I decided to not buy any. I don't blame anybody for that, it was my decision and I accept the consequences of my decision.

So in conclusion, instead of blaming other people or blaming government policy or market conditions, or even the system itself, what you should be doing is accepting personal responsibility for yourself, and accepting the fact that every exploited poor worker around you need to accept personal responsibility for themselves too. Then you can grow out of your socialist delusions and come to live in the real America.&gt;The rich pay more for it

No, they don't.  For the last time, here's facts and evidence:

https://bbs.boingboing.net/t/why-the-hyper-rich-turn-into-crybabies-when-one-percent-is-invoked/20739/171

You're basing your suppositions upon emotion instead of facts and evidence.
They shouldn't be paying anything towards it. These problems do not affect them. If somebody throws a can on your lawn, are you going to put that in the trash, or are they?For your sake, I hope you're not this dense and are simply trolling me.Jesus, that's a horrific bunch of nonsense. This guy is the academic equivalent of Judge Clarence Thomas.#McResistance. 

I hate the Dems. If you’re with the Dems, you’re either happily going along with their bullshit or, at the very least, compliant. Fuck that noise. No one should be with the dems as they've been over the last number of cycles, certainly, but the Big Umbrella is what We make of it.  It's been overrun by corporateDems for decades now, but JusticeDems and similar efforts (which support candidates that refuse corporate donations) might just be the key to redefine the party. Just wanted to share an Amazing progressive candidate i am sure you all know and love It's really astonishing to me that this narrative, which could easily pass as a Hollywood parody, is being accepted as fact by the general public. I don't know if I'm more surprised that the media would go all in on such a hokey story or that the public would be naive enough to believe it.I can answer for them.  It's because they're corporatist, neoliberal lackeys, that's why.

Same reason most of my local TV stations in Denver, CO refused to inform the public of upcoming Bernie Sanders rallies and the one station that did notify the public waited until the last minute.

For example, local TV Channel 7 ABC News, Channel 4 CBS news and Channel 31 FOX31 completely ignored his upcoming rally in June of 2015. NOTHING. And, local Denver TV Channel 9 NBC news disgracefully didn't mention the event until literally only about 3 hours before the event started.

When Channel 9 was taken to task by activists, they made up a bullshit excuse that they attempted to interview Bernie and he didn't contact them back.  Has nothing to do with covering his rally but the assholes simply attempted to gaslight the public.  And, never mind the fact that KUSA Denver NBC Channel 9 didn't enforce that transparent gaslighting bullshit requirement for Hillary Clinton nor Trump.

**Fuck you**, Channel 9.That was a pretty satisfying read. I almost threw up in my mouth a number of times during his appearance on the Waking Up podcast that just came out: https://samharris.org/podcasts/114-politics-and-sanity/

On the bright side, more and more people are calling the Iraq war for what it is: a war crime, even if these pseudo intellectuals are still unwavering empire apologists.So this broad couldn’t be bothered to show up for people of color but doesn’t like our “president”? Fuck you lady. "They've obviously fallen for my trap - the DOUBLE CAVE!"

this is what you look like when you show off your entire wall.  nobodys got time for this You don't have to read all of the things on the wall, though.why would i read one thing when you look like a nutjob?  get to the point and if you can't find damning evidence, that you can show without looking like a nutjob, stop wasting all our time.

democrats can win elections by focusing on economics and healthcare.  They just have to actually do that.&gt; democrats can win elections by focusing on economics and healthcare. They just have to actually do that.

Yes or no, that question is irrelevant to my thread and is a separate question.

**I'm just saying Trump-Russian collusion is real, and it is built over a an existing close relationship between Trump and Russian Oligarchs over a long time, and there is with a mountain of evidence to support that claim.** 

Whether you think it would be an important factor in upcoming election is for you to think. 

whether you think the Dems should focus on economics and healthcare is your opinion.

by my opinions are backed up with polls that show the American people overwhelmingly are on our side on these issues.  yet they don't seem to know it.  

but you would rather talk about russa.  when this is all you got

Does anyone else know what's up with the salt Jimmy is throwing at TYT throughout the video? Seems like there's some beef backstage.
I don't know, but I'd be thrilled to see him off TYT. They've sold out. Jimmy won't.He’s probably too radical for them, and they are too “establishment” for him.  It’s been a long development since the election.  I am guessing he is feeling more confident nowadays and feels less of a need to moderate himself while on TYT (outside of Aggressive Progressives).At one point he said something about TYT not wanting him on their SOTU livestream. Probably mad about that.^(Hi, I'm a bot for linking direct images of albums with only 1 image)

Call me a humanist because it seems many atheists still believe that some people are more holy than others.

These are the same people who can't describe why a police officer shooting an unarmed black teen is a violation of all of our rights. These "atheists" see it as *mis*applied violence from people possessed by supernatural evil causing them to be racists.Oh you mean the super predators?

-HRCWhat difference does it make?

What a terrible hand Bernie is playing. He's walking right into the bear trap set for him, though he thinks it's for Trump.&gt; collusion  
&gt; oligarchs  

My opinion is that you don’t understand what either of these two words mean.  
  
Trump isn’t the problem.  He is a symptom of the problem.  Focusing on Russia isn’t going to fix the last 40 years of Democrats fucking over their base and turning into Republicans that are cool with gay marriage and abortions.  
  
Eventually, the wrong poor people are going to die due to their inability to get proper healthcare, or get laid off due to outsourcing.  Our policies are creating a world of haves and have-nots.  The rich will be eaten by the poor.  We will absolutely see more and more attempts on the lives of those in office or places of power.  Eventually it will trickle down to anything with a nice house.  
  
I don’t have any fantasies about living in that world or raising my children in it, but that is the path we are heading down.  If you take away the ability for a society to effect non-violent change, the only logical outcome is violent change.  Oh God, not you, Bernie! *facepalm*I will not believe any documentary that paints Thatcher as some sort of hero, disgusting piece of propaganda that tries to promote capitalist elitism as some sort of saving grace.Someone missed the point.Probably, but any point that involves saying that thatcher did anything right for society is one point that I want to miss.I hate Thatcher as much as anyone else. I'm just putting it up here because it's an interesting documentary short.I get you. My bad, I thought it was a piece of ignorance from the perspective of an American and it cut me up the wrong way. I respect that the rest of the documentary was your point, so I’m sorry.Hey everyone just wanted to spread the word for an amazing candidate Alison Hartson hope you enjoy  Fuck yes!! I’ve been cursing Rogan in my head for weeks for not having any sane progressives on and only conservatives. Fuck yeah!!Totally. The conservatives were good guests with some interesting points, but the automatic dismissal of socialism as a whole (because the soviet union!) was annoying.

I love that Joe can speak intelligently with both sides; he's definitely helping bridge the divide."Israel has started issuing deportation notices to African asylum seekers from Eritrea and Sudan."

Seems like this is just for asylum seekers. The title makes it seem like all Africans are being kicked out of IsraelThis is guna be awesomeAll the conservatives he’s had on seem to be for unregulated capitalism and they call people socialist when they aren’t also. That annoys me. The balance is somewhere in the middle but they cant seem to figure that out while billionaire donors have all the say so in every single issue that matters. How much longer till people are in a he streets? I hope it’s soonWhen I first saw this article from The Hill,

I am a bot trying to encourage a balanced news diet.

These are all of the articles I think are about this
                story. I do not select or sort articles based on any opinions or
                perceived biases, and neither I nor my creator advocate for or
                against any of these sources or articles. It is your responsibility
                to determine what is factually correct.Wut. 


That's seriously fucked up. did you see the map?J. Edgar Hoover was also a gay uncle Tom, since he didn't do anything but undermine gay rights, and meanwhile didn't fight against any oppression, as we all know oppression is intersectional. Progress for the left's other causes would have meant J. Edgar Hoover would have had an easier life being gay, but he couldn't see that I guess. 

In other words, these people are just against progress (and therefore progressives) and are suffering because of it.The FBI is 81% caucasian, and 85% male. If that's not a red flag for closed off patriarchy I don't know what is. Also, I feel sorry for the straight men there, because they have nothing to jerk off to.

edit: Oh I'm getting downvoted because I want the government to hire more women?Rant? people are asshats when drunk and cuffed broken. but this steroid raged, over sensitive, over reacting, non fearing, police officer union hiding behind, is really on my last nerve. this is daily never ending constant crack of skulls. reform? replace? change?training? simple human feeling? sorry-fix 50 different states thousands of towns... Layers of lawyers.  sheriff drug task, swat, road pirate. what? Gun control.  end gun ownership. cops looking like batman. full auto weapons all the time to get ya for a warrant missed court again lost job permanent record. Mr Spicoli. courts to prison to fat money payout corporate middle men. any thoughts here and now. would help.  People are being ground up like hamburger.Uhhh, no?  I'm sorry you don't get the bigger picture here, so let me explain.  This was a test flight of the falcon heavy, there needs to be some sort of payload to test its capabilities.  So, why not do something fun and advertise electric cars (helps the planet btw) The falcon heavy will allow cheaper access to space and further science and human exploration.  One project that SpaceX is working on it global high speed Internet access that is cheap and net neutral. yeah but people are acting like he did something productive. how does lunching a car into space advance the human race?
See above as to why it was a car.  As far as to how this helps the human race.  Have you ever seen a weather report? made a long distance phone call? Watched the Olympics from the other side of the world? You can thank satellites for that, or NASA.  There is so much that can be learned and we can grow as a species by having an affordable space launch system.  SpaceX has brought the cost down to roughly a 3rd of what it typically costs.   There are numerous reasons for humans to be in space and to become multiplanetary.  What if we detected an asteroid headed for Earth in the near future?  There have been several global killers that have hit the Earth before.  We just can't wait around for the next one, we can actually do something about it.It was the first flight of an unproven rocket. SpaceX offered the cargo space to NASA and I believe Boeing but both of them declined to put any of their satellites on an unproven rocket so SpaceX said, fuck it and send Elon's car up.  

Normally, first launches of unproven rockets would have cargo space filled with lead weights or whatever junk.

Launching the car into space advances the human race because it proved the Falcon Heavy can launch massive cargos into space. Just wait until you see the BFR sending 100 people to Mars...  and no, the first flight of the BFR will not be testing with 100 volunteers.  They'll send something equally whimsical on it's first flight, I'm sure.Ok, but which side has signs **explicitly** promoting the death of others? This article has the answer.

This is a difficult situation between two groups of people that the silent majority doesn't approve of. In these situations the cops always side with the side willing/able to snitch on the other side.If stating publicly available donor information is attacking a person's character, what's next?productive? maybe you could do with some.When Jimmy talks, when he goes into a rant, he is always talking straight FROM MY HEART.

Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

- [/r/wayofthebern] [Some thoughts on Michael Brook’s video about Jimmy](https://www.reddit.com/r/WayOfTheBern/comments/7x21xf/some_thoughts_on_michael_brooks_video_about_jimmy/)

&amp;nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*The issue with Sam Seder and Michael Brooks is that they are both believers in American political kayfabe. They think the theater is the reality. They are victims. JIMMY DORE IS A FAILED NIGHTCLUB COMEDIAN PANDERING TO VERY NAIVE PEOPLE. YOU ARE ALL DUMB CUNTS. You must be one dumb fucker. It’s common knowledge that Jimmy is a jaggoff nightclub comedian.  Do you have something more insightful to share with us?That might be the case for Seder, but I think Brooks is more savvy than that.  I think that his position is closer to Chomsky, who believes that most significant change happens outside of the voting booth through grassroots political activism, but that the presidential election is the time to vote for the lesser of the two evils.There was ample room for a great series of debates between Jimmy and the MR crew. Sam has been infinitely clear on the subject since day one: he'd happily accept the revoked invitation to appear on Jimmy's show and he's consistently left open his own invitation to have Jimmy back.

I'm just sorta tired of people acting like Sam or Micheal have any responsibility here when they've done everything possible to continue the debate and Jimmy has just shat all over them.I love your caps.He's not. Michael is a con artist. His understanding of socialism is weak and puny. He's jumping on the bandwagon because it's cool right now. 

Just like Sam Seder, he berates people who refused to support Hillary Clinton. 

Jimmy didn't name anyone in that video. Brooks is just using this as a chance to make a feud to try t get more subscribers and donors. 

Seriously fuck that dude. 

Sam is a sellout (literally he got on the MSNBC payroll) and Brooks is a wannabe sellout. 
Sam and Michael are upper middle class elitists who have no clue of the struggles faced by people in this country. 

They can't understand how people are willing to withhold our votes from neoliberal Dems after their policies have wrecked America and destroyed our communities and our lives. 

Our lives are already in ruins after 24 years of the Clinton-Bush-Obama presidency. 

I voted for Jill Stein in a swing state and I'll do it again. With either Clinton or Trump in office my family is screwed either way.  

If we burn, you burn, liberal dummies. 

Michael has talked on the show about growing up, at least at some points, in poverty—with his family even being homeless for a bit. And I doubt he’s living in an upscale apartment right now.

Seriously, you can’t just dismiss everyone you dislike as “upper middle class elitists,” especially when you clearly know jack shit about them.His parents were like professors at Umass or something. He grew up in Amherst. He probably calls that poverty.
Michael is a sleazebag. Jimmy didn't name him or refer to him at all in that video. It's not even clear that he knows who Michael Brooks is. 

Michael is just combing through TJDS videos looking for easy stuff to attack. It's an opportunistic smear job just to get clicks and donors for Michael's show. Pathetic. 
This entire feud goes back to Sam having Jimmy on the Majority Report. That's the only reason Michael's talking about any of this stuff. But it took a huge number of failed launches for SpaceX to get to this point - terrible waste of resources - and the benefits from this system having been perfected will obviously be more commercial than scientific.

The OP is not wrong, in that this is going to be more a money-making enterprise than a science-advancing enterprise. It will be a bus service for billionaires, the company will get extremely rich, and that's about it.

For pure scientific research in outer space, we've already got the International Space Station for that, and furthermore these type of flights had already been done to death before by both the US and the Russians and all the other state agencies.

The Russian Soyuz system was already a relatively cheap and efficient method to send cargo up and down, just dated and old-fashioned because the Russians don't have any money to keep developing it.I don't understand how a self-described Dem Socialist like Brooks can take that position towards third parties, the Democratic Party and people like Jimmy. 

...actually, I do understand it. It has to do with how they are trying to grow their show (but it's a pretty awful way to do it).

Like TYT, their approach to growth is to attempt to be a kind of MSNBC-in-miniature (also since Sam literally appears on MSNBC, if not nearly as often as he'd like, and gets an MSNBC paycheck) in which model you have to be kicking around a certain number of both rightwingers and leftwingers. Doesn't really matter how you do it or who you have to pick on...because the goal is merely to create the superficial appearance of "centrism" and "balance".

It's that cheap ploy of trying to communicate to your audience "you and me, we're the reasonable ones" but without actually making that case based on reason. You just pick convenient targets on the Right (this is very easy) and you pick convenient targets on the Left (this is harder, especially if you're theoretically Left yourself) and you throw tomatoes at both of them.

In Sam's case, Jimmy is that target because they're both fishing into the same pool of viewers (i.e. the crowd of Youtubers who stumble across TYT and TYT Network before they really get into anything else). And if he didn't have Jimmy to kick around then he would casually throw that focus unto some other unabashedly leftist pundit channel that has more Youtube viewers than Cedar does.

Though it must be added that Jimmy has helped to make this target on his back a little bigger by insufficiently researching a few stories prior to pouncing on them. Sam doesn't make that kind of mistake but he's guilty of the same kind of information manipulation and partisan dishonesty as the majority of the supposedly "left-of-center" pundits with MSM access engage in...they try to stack the whole deck and every single debate in favor of a kind of genteel and condescending 'progressivism' which never really attacks the Democratic establishment.
An actual person-to-person debate is one thing, but in the absence of one, why the continued attacks on Jimmy and why this relentless Left-punching? (I think I know why, see my post above, and it's not an admirable reason). Conversely it's not like Jimmy has any ongoing on-show vendetta against The Majority Report, also because that target is far too small. 

That's valuable air time that must be devoted to attacking the actual Corporate Media. Which the MR could also be doing instead of wasting time on Jimmy Dore. Instead, they're letting MSNBC and CNN and other MSM entities off the hook.Dude, he has described being temporarily homeless as a kid and living in poverty. You can try to talk around that as much as you want to deflect from the fact you weren't just being an asshole, but *wrong*, but it's reality.Oh, come on. Jimmy made some angry tweets while Michael was on, and was *obviously* invoking those as well as commenting on Michael's appearance directly. He was talking about Michael in that video, and it's obvious to anyone who saw Michael on TYT, Jimmy's tweets, and then Jimmy's vide. Unfortunately, Jimmy's not only too cowardly to go on Sam's show again, he's also too cowardly to name or show what he's whinging about.&gt;  It's not even clear that he knows who Michael Brooks is. 

Jimmy has talked to Michael on the Majority Report before.You're right - it would have been much better if they saved those resources and just skipped the failed launches.

We should also tell SpaceX and all the other private launch companies to get stuffed and continue using Soyuz spacecraft for trips to the ISS, even if they are 5X more expensive. Oh, and let's just let the Russians take over the ISS completely since we cannot use their Soyuz rockets any longer after 2019. But that's cool, all the other State space agencies will do the scientific research and share the results with the USA. No really, this is brilliant. Just let all the other countries do the research and we get the benefits FOR FREE!

You're really smart.  I love this idea of leaving everything to the Russians and the USA just snickers and gets all the benefits without wasting resources or with any of that messy rocket research and development, or saving money by having private industry develop rockets. Brilliant!

Not to mention the ridiculous notion of developing the BFF to send people to mars (at an estimated $250,000 per person). We don't need to move off the Earth!  And $250,000 will only allow billionaires to go to Mars, not a single poverty-stricken beggar will be allowed to go!  Progress is for suckers!  So what? I could introduce you to more than a few poor and homeless people who are deeply misguided politically. Also a few (but fewer in number) who are on the ball politically.

Social backgrounds are not an argument. Jimmy was the youngest of a poor family of beat cops, but that's not an argument either. Friedrich Engels (the co-conspirator and financial sponsor of Karl Marx) was the spoilt son of a rich factory owner. Not an argument.

So the point is that a socialist is not immediately beyond criticism just because he comes from a certain background. Brooks is not a more convincing socialist just because he comes from somewhere. Actions and positions are the only thing that matters. Any socialist who stumped for Hillary Clinton is extremely suspicious in my book and I am a card-carrying socialist myself. This suspicion and scepticism goes double for anyone who is trying to be a media personality on Youtube (a platform driven entirely by clicks and advertising).

You don't get to attack someone on their class and background (incorrectly, by the way), and when called out about how you're making shit up, say it doesn't matter. Come on.Why are you resorting to all caps, Don? That stuff is for trolls. I'll argue your points except you ain't got none.I'm speaking for myself, not for anyone else, so don't quote anyone else in reply to my points. I don't care about whatever the lead-in was. You don't get to defend anyone's centrist politics based on "boo hoo, they ate out of trash cans".Ah, sorry, I didn't realize you were a different person who jumped in. Interesting to me that you're mad at me for talking about this stuff, when it was the person I replied to that brought all that shit into the conversation anyway. I wasn't trying to make it about Michael's background, but since someone else did (wrongly), I corrected them. Yet I'm the one you're lecturing about backgrounds not being relevant.I apologize for jumping in unexpectedly. But one type of social apologetics is worse than the other. If you're accusing a centrist of being too upper class, this may be inaccurate but it's understandable, and this is less serious than defending a centrist on the basis of some Dickensian, I'm-from-the-gutter basis. Except Michael isn't a centrist, even if he makes a point about voting you dislike. You can argue that on this position he is effectively centrist because voting Democrat in the presidential election overrides all your political positions and actions, but that's a pretty blatant misrepresentation of the word "centrist."

And again, it's interesting that one of these things bothers you while the other doesn't, even though Jimmy is not left of Michael, and I was responding to blatant falsehoods about Michael. It's almost like you're just supportive of Jimmy generally and finding wys to shut down anyone defending Michael.I question whether Brooks is indeed to the left of JD. I have been watching both shows without encountering anything in support of this. Claiming to be a democratic socialist certainly doesn't count because anyone can dress themselves in a label (as I've suggested). 

Jimmy says that he voted for Jill Stein. While we don't have anything but his word to go on, I don't recall Brooks saying that he ever voted for any third party.

You can justify all of this in relation to the Winner-Take-All electoral system, perhaps, but really, on what basis does he claim to be superior to Jimmy Dore? I realize that he wants more viewers than Jimmy Dore has, but again, on what basis? I can tell you from experience that his viewers are almost exclusively centrists.Well, for one, Brooks recognizes how massively limited the presidential election (or all electoral politics) is for achieving genuine political change. He may've voted Hillary over Jill, but that does not de facto make him "less left" than Jimmy, because Jimmy lacks political insight or recommendations outside of these arenas. In Michael's show and appearances on MR, he almost always emphasizes political action and power outside of (not) voting for Democrats, with clear ideas about how to build power in several areas of life. Jimmy's got anger at the Democrats. If you look at the substance of what Michael talks about, it's about building avenues of power for the left to improve people's lives today, gain institutional power tomorrow, and ultimately end capitalism. Jimmy does not have this analysis, he just has anger at the Democrats.

So yes, if you consider "how left" someone is as defined by if they voted for Hillary or Jill, then Jimmy is more left. By any other metric, though, Michael is not just more left than Jimmy, he's more *informed* on just about every issue and matter regarding politics, which means he understands how to not just be mad, but to actually do something.What? That's not what the Majority Report communicates at all. I mean, look at their Youtube channel. https://www.youtube.com/user/SamSeder/videos 90% of their videos are clearly geared to deflect any possible blame from Obama and Corporate Democrats. 

I don't have to limit myself to any individual vote - never said that I did, anyway - because I can clearly point at all these videos which are completely devoid of criticism of the Democratic establishment. Feel free to disprove me on that.&gt; 90% of their videos are clearly geared to deflect any possible blame from Obama and Corporate Democrats

What? They criticize Obama and the Democrats *repeatedly*. If you watch their show ever, you'll see that they are happy to contextualize issues in terms of Democrats' role, they just ALSO shit on Republicans (ya know, the people in direct power across our entire government at the moment). I do not know how you can watch MR or TMBS and think they're about apologizing for Obama or the Democrats, unless you think recognizing the basic fact that Democrats are less atrocious on a handful of important issues than Republicans is some deep centrist apologia.

Hell, I'm listening live now and they're criticizing the Democrats as a party. 1:34pm EST 2/13. Literally at this moment.I was referring specifically to their Youtube selection, because I linked to it. https://www.youtube.com/user/SamSeder/videos

That's all most people see. Not any long feed because most people don't listen to any two hour feed. Feel free to explain why your argument is not borne out by that long list of videos. Feel free to explain why not a single one of their videos is titled to be an attack on the Democratic party.I don't see many videos titled to specifically attack either party? They're about topics, and if they're about people, it's about people with massive amounts of power right now (e.g., ya know, the president). If you watch their videos or search more directly for what you want, you'll find that it doesn't fit your obviously incorrect analysis. So far, your argument is "their video titles from the past month don't directly attack Democrats enough"? Not even that the videos don't, just that the titles don't do so obviously. Come on. You don't know MR or Michael Brooks, and you're finding any way to undercut him without actually engaging with the content. It's a waste of everyone's time.

But I guess if research and nuance were valued here, it wouldn't be a Jimmy Dore subreddit.Oh come on. Michael is an irrelevant sidekick. He's not memorable in the least.  Jimmy could have been talking about any number of liberals who are cashing in by scolding third party voters. 

There are always going to be 2 or 3 percent of people who refuse to vote for corporate Dems. Deal with it. Stop scolding us.  It's really condescending. 
He probably doesn't even remember him. He's not memorable in the least except as "that liberal dummy who makes fun of foreign accents" I don’t care about how you vote. Michael says in the clip that he doesn’t care what you the individual voter do (or maybe that was on the TYT clip Jimmy was obviously referencing). It’s not about you, it’s about larger criticisms of structural change and the people who have the potential to shape conversations on this matter.

Also, it was 100% clear Jimmy was talking about Michael. Jimmy whined about Michael without naming him while he was on TYT, and trotted out the same criticisms (and some more references to Michael’s appearance that didn’t use his name but used his words) for the clip Michael featured. It is plainfacedly obviously that Michael is who he was talking about. You can pretend otherwise but that’s exactly what it is: pretending.Don't avoid the question, please. I can certainly point at plenty of their videos which directly attack Republicans, or directly attack the Republican party, or directly attack the corruptions of the Republican party.

My question is - very simply - why I can't point at any videos which point directly at Democrats or the Democratic party, or at any of the corruptions of the Democratic party.I don't believe him. He's a piece of shit liar. A real ladder climber whose interest in leftist politics is nothing more than opportunistic careerism. 

Instead of scolding people for voting third party these MSNBC liberals should focus on fixing their own shitty politics. I think Jimmy is a piece of shit liar who is looking to career climb (faux outrage is a much easier ladder than actual history and analysis, but that's not a relevant factor in this argument. You can dodge around the issues and moe the goalposts as soon as one of your points is called out or debunked, but I'm not gonna keep following you down these random paths.The person who held most of the power was, until recently, Obama. Jimmy Dore has no compunction about attacking that person - that self-described "moderate conservative" - or his ideology, then or now, but apparently one can't say the same about Michael Brooks.&gt;he doesn’t care what you the individual voter do

Actually that's what the whole thing is about. Sam and his baby boy Michael literally calling us the "dumb dumb left" because we refused to vote for Hillary Clinton in Michigan, Ohio, PA, etc. They have the attitude that if you refuse to vote for their so-called "lesser evil" that it's basically because you must have emotional problems, or you're just a dummy you doesn't understand politics. That's the root cause.  Sam (and Michael) refusing to acknowledge that third party voting is a legitimate and intellectually sound form of strategic voting for progressives. 

They are trying to frame it as "strategic voting" vs. "emotional voting for personal expression". But that's not what it is. Really both ways are strategic and it's just a different strategy.  
&gt;Don't avoid the question, please.

I didn't. Note that I said this:

&gt;I don't see many videos titled to specifically attack either party? They're about topics, and if they're about people, it's about people with massive amounts of power right now

Each of these videos is about an individual Republican. And they're criticizing individual Republicans because those are the people with power right now. However, because you're apparently too lazy to look at all, here're some titles from the past few months:

`
Democrats CAVED With No Strategy During Government Shutdown
`

`It's WAY Past Time For The Democratic Party Move On From The Clintons`

`Why Democrats Caved On FISA`

`Republicans Don't Care About Incrementalism, Why Do Democrats?`

Now, if you want to go back to when Democrats held more power, you'd find more videos specifically criticizing the party and individual members. But again, that requires research and watching actual videos.

I'm sorry that the five most recent video titles or whatever don't fit your narrative, and that you have to read a little or even *gasp* watch one of their videos to know their actual political analysis, but that's called *doing the research*.YOU CAN. He criticizes Obama all the fucking time, on drones, on healthcare, on foreign policy, on economic policy, on deportations, and *so much more*. Stop just making up shit when you have zero idea what you're talking about. You are constantly lying to cover your ass, and making up a new lie when your old lie is called out. Just stop.&gt; Democrats CAVED With No Strategy During Government Shutdown

Pretty good one, but that still puts most of the responsibiilty on the other side. It's also a near-unanimous sentiment among the Democratic base. Not going out on any anti-establishmentarian limbs here.

&gt; It's WAY Past Time For The Democratic Party Move On From The Clintons

That's from three months ago. Already had to go that deep into the archives, did you? Not surprised. 

This is a video that takes all of Donna Brazile's claims at face value so it's actually a video about a feud WITHIN the Democratic establishment, not a video against that establishment.

&gt; Why Democrats Caved On FISA

Apologetic. Also ignores the fact that for 8 years, Democrats made use of FISA.

&gt; Republicans Don't Care About Incrementalism, Why Do Democrats?

More importantly, why does The Majority Report? Because they are so eager to support every act of Democrat incrementalism.What's "faux outrage" when you're outraged about neoliberal ideology, as Jimmy always is? George Monbiot accurately observed that "most of our problems can be traced back to neoliberal ideology". https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/15/neoliberalism-ideology-problem-george-monbiot

And, ironically,  George Monbiot was invited that make that very point on the Majority Report https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOYcL5JZys4 (though the segment was overlong and didn't get to the point fast enough)Well, link me to a single video then. The most recent video about Obama that I can find is one that tries to absolve Obama and cover Obama's neoliberal/neoconservative ass. It's from yesterday.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbqcMpOm_Y0
Michael Brooks has a single writing credit at Jacobin Magazine: it's a piece trying to compare the Republican Party to the Turkish AKP party of Erdogan. https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/07/erdogan-washington-kurdish-protesters-trump-republican-party

Analogy doesn't really work, Mike. The working classes involved are too different. How about comparing the upwardly mobile elements of the Democratic Party to the upper echelons of ISIS? You'd get further.share this story. cops are not being honest. expired tag and your dead telling the wrong mother that her son was dead and that he shot at cops. call them bumbling stumbling "Barney" wannabes but just liars will do. surprised that they didnt beat her to death and claim resisting. Hi Robert. We both know Jimmy is the one who's refused to continue the one-on-one debate with Sam. We both know the MR crew would desperately like to continue the one-on-one conversation that Jimmy started and ended over a year ago.That's a conversation between the Left (the real Left) and the Majority Report (the fake Left). They can invite two dozen people to continue that conversation, because that conversation most certainly isn't limited to Jimmy. My primary suggestions would be Chris Hedges, Lee Camp, Cornel West, Jill Stein, Killer Mike, Nina Turner, Abby Martin, etc. So my real question would be, why aren't any of these people coming to the Majority Report?This is the same argument everyone makes against MR when cornered in this conversation: why aren't they doing other people's shows? Why do they keep producing their own show with its own content rather than interviewing the people other shows talk to? Why all the labor history and criminology and political history and investigative journalism when you could be talking about the DNC? Why waste a whole show with a social epidemiologist discussing the deadly cost of inequality?

It's a lazy argument to focus on a single clip taken out of the dozen hours of content Michael and Sam produce every week and chastise them for how they spent that ten minutes.No, that's just a silly attempt to avoid the question I posed. Again, why aren't they getting any of the progressive guests I listed? Answers please.Scottish people make fun of every foreign accent that exists. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzV-u73jdWg That hasn't stopped Leftist Scottish Person Michael Blyth from coming to the Jimmy Dore Show and expounding his economic theories.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmmGTyXDcT8&amp;list=PLdYano3HZjnfEnW7hczcYLXyMQUEGSybRExactly Right IMO.That was fucking fantastic. This is some damn good satire. He got so many in this thread too.Your question was an evasion. We were talking about the conversation between Jimmy and MR, not some broader debate that doesn't exist between Sam and all those people.Yeah, I was worried going in for some reason. I like both shows and was worried they wouldn't like each other? lolThis was so embarrassing Joe is a perfectly reasonable dude, he just likes to have people from all ends of the spectrum on his show. As of late, he has had more right-wingers on than left, which is why you probably had that perception.How lol? Jimmy performed beyond my expectations, and Joe had some great insights. Plus I learned shit about Jimmy I never knew, so that's a plusJimmy is a huge hit on The Donald. So he has that going for him. Yeah, I loved the old days comedy talk, the new info about Jimmy he doesn't talk about on his shows, and he even got in a number of his classic rants. First thing I noticed when I opened the video was that it went 2.6 hours; I figured it must have went well and it did.Sorry, I hadn't seen this post yet. Apologies for the double.Looks like Christmas came early!Rogan was more receptive to Jimmy's political ideas than I expected. He's certainly not deaf to critiques of the failing political and economic system.

And I especially like Rogan's views on the Big agro-business and on wild life. The instinct to decouple oneself from a corrupt system is a good one (though, as he says, it's not possible for the vast majority of people to act on that impulse so you end up more with political fantasies than anything else. Still, the instinct in itself is good.)...of course it has more! Cenk is a major dickhead. Jimmy is a straight shooter.... and hasn’t sold out!Undermines the left?... you’re high as a kite thinking that they are for one party. FBI is a corrupted arm of the deep state. They work with any crooked politician, from ANY party!We need a progressive to take every single corporate democrat out of office. Crop your picture and reread that sentence you wrote. This is an absolute mess of a post. Their whole idea for 2020 is to try and blur the divide policy wise between Bernie and other corporate dems. That way they can push stuff like this and a "pledge" to medicare for all as them caving in to the left when Bernie is cheated.Just wanted to share an amazing progressive Chardo Richardson hope you all enjoy 
If either of them somehow won in 2020 they would immediately start taking corporate money post election. Bernie will never take corporate money. We need to make sure everyone sees the difference.I was VERY DRUNK. I’m definitely going to leave it I think it’s funny. I’m definitely going to have to edit that post on /r/worldnews though. I’m definitely downvoting my original post here 😅Eventually they'll go back and claim they simply have to. You didn't even screenshot the post. You screenshoted the submit box. Also, posting a screenshot of your own comment to another subreddit is pretty pathetic.

Don't bother downvoting. You're at 0 which is as low as you can go. It’s really funny. I love this!Are you still drunk? No I’m just not a nihilist. Are you?I have no idea what nihilism has to do with you being shit at reddit. Here is a list of threads in other subreddits about the same content:

&gt;The vast majority of us in the anti-sanders wing are saying any cooperation was unwitting and unknown at the time. If Bernie does want to run in 2020, he will need to address Russia, though, through transparency (e.g. tax returns) &amp; ensuring it doesn’t happen again.With stuff like this, dems are just asking for another four years of Trump.Mee too bro. I'm disgusted with how people only talk about things cause they are trending in the internet. People can no longer think for themselves.

Hope we get a video covering this.they are not saying they wont take bundled money from the dncPeople should learn about National Endowment for Democracy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Endowment_for_Democracy**National Endowment for Democracy**

The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) is a U.S. non-profit soft power organization that was founded in 1983 with the stated goal of promoting democracy abroad. It is funded primarily through an annual allocation from the U.S. Congress in the form of a grant awarded through the United States Information Agency (USIA). It was created by The Democracy Program as a bipartisan, private, non-profit corporation, and in turn acts as a grant-making foundation. In addition to its grants program, NED also supports and houses the Journal of Democracy, the World Movement for Democracy, the International Forum for Democratic Studies, the Reagan–Fascell Fellowship Program, the Network of Democracy Research Institutes, and the Center for International Media Assistance.

People wouldn't admit that to themselves, let alone to others people. That is just human nature, and some corporate conspiracy.You.  I like you.I think the more progressives get involved and work to fix things, the more apparent the extent of the corruption is. Combine that with the fact that so many people who identify as a democrat has no desire to even acknowledge any wrong doing by the party and you end up with  misanthropic defeatism.Damn, spot on!This is precisely why its taking so long to change. People aren't aware of how bad the corruption is because they don't have any politicians to point to and say "see, THAT'S a good politician!"

Sanders was one of the first ones in a long, long time that made people think "THAT is what a politician should be."

Without GOOD ones being visible, the people have nothing to compare the bad ones too. So they don't complain.

It's why the Dems need a MESSAGE beyond "we're not them!"This picture should be in black and white, because it's been that long since "the left"/Dems have been on the side of workers. Before modern civilization and the agricultural revolution, humans were egalitarian.  We had to be. This was an entertaining and insightful discussion.  Thank you for sharing this.i hope things like this are being taught at schools one day. seems way more interesting than suck up and follow and repeat.&gt; Joe Rogan in clip: I was infuriated when people that I knew that I was friends with were trying to tell me that Hillary Clinton was a good choice.
&gt;
&gt; Sam: Pause it.
&gt;
&gt; Sam: Of course he's talking about in the race with Donald Trump ...
&gt;
&gt; Joe: That that's the same choice.  Look, I don't know that she's murdered people, but I know that I wonder if she's murdered people.  I mean this Seth Rich shit...
&gt;
&gt; Sam: Pause it for one second, that's interesting...
&gt;
&gt; Sam (at 7:15 in video): And I would add.. I would add.. that Seth Rich was killed.. *after* the election.  So I don't know who he thought that she had killed before then.

What the fuck?  Seth was killed before Hillary was even officially nominated by the Democrats. Is Sam intentionally spreading misinformation about Seth Rich?  Pot meet fucking kettle.
That first guy: this is your brain on capitalism.Nope.  They agree on some things, and disagree on others.  It's almost like they are all rational adults.  He was on the main show [just today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3wzDSI_-j8).

EDIT: Added link.There is a disagreement on the importance of the Russia scandals but that seems to be the only thing.  I thought I saw Cenk with Jimmy at a live show about a week ago.Workers are greedy and selfish, to put it one way, yet they're the only ones being punished for it.And the reason why we should listen to Jamari Thomas?  I tried to google him, but apparently there is a high school football player by that name who has apparently achieved more renown than this guy.

I don't want to dig on small youtubers, but he seems to think we should just accept his opinion because he doesn't seem to offer a single justification for anything.

You and I have already established that TYT barely covers the Russia influence at all, and you can't point to one thing that they actually say that's unreasonable.  It's only the crazy TYT dolls dancing in your head that are crazy about the issue.

If you have a case to make, quit being lazy and make it.  Lets get some quotes in context.  Lets get a reasonable estimate for how much time they spend on the story.  Lets compare the time they spend on the story with the time they spend on other stories.  Lets get something.  You are obsessed with this shit, yet you only seem capable of linking to lame videos.  Think for yourself man!Jamarl has his head way up his ass.  I like some of his messages and critiques of TYT, corporate Dems, etc. but he uses far too many straw man attacks and outright hyperbole for me to take him seriously.

https://twitter.com/Cowicide/status/970345459146358784

It's ironic that a guy that loves to critique TYT so much is so incredibly thin-skinned, obtuse and impervious to a critique of himself.



I'm just sick to death of the left eating itself.  Any difference in someone else's ideology and they are suddenly the enemy.  It's insane and it's pervasive.Sounds like Justice Democrats were infiltrated. I've also observed that there doesn't have to be any significant difference in ideology for people like Jamarl to get hostile.  If there's a similar ideology, but a different *strategy* for getting progressive results you may get demonized by him.

Jamarl and Jimmy spend a lot of time rightfully denouncing those who attack progressives, etc. who didn't vote for Hillary.  However, they have become their own enemies and routinely attack people that did vote for Hillary in the general election as well.  That's hypocritical bullshit.

I voted Bernie in the primary and Hillary in the general election.  Jamarl has claimed that people like me are basically brainwashed, DNC-duped nonces for my Hillary vote and, unfortunately, so has Jimmy Dore lately.  They are becoming guilty of the same harmful rhetoric that they denounce and are pulling into their own counterproductive bubbles as a result.

I think both sides that engage in this hate for those who voted for Hillary or  vice versa are being counterproductive.  I voted for Hillary in the general but I certainly understand why many progressives did not - and I do NOT chastise them for their decision.  How would doing that bring more progressives together?  It doesn't.

What people like Jamarl and Jimmy don't attempt to understand is I voted for Hillary in the general not just because she was the lesser evil, but because she was the weaker opposition for progressive agendas **overall**.

Jimmy and Jamarl do lay out some very good arguments that Hillary would've been a more difficult foe for progressives (and in some cases I agree).  However, I think evidence shows that we'd make much more progress with her in office *overall* for a host of good reasons they never seem to consider.

I voted for Hillary in the general election over Trump not because I'm a brainwashed, Democrat-loving nonce, but because I strategically look at more factors than Jimmy or Jamarl seem to do.

What Jarmal and Jimmy don't consider is the fact that corporate Democrats have to keep up appearances of being an opposition party to the GOP.  Once that curtain falls, that'll open up the floodgates for progressives to take over the party and foster progressive third parties to gain powerful, grassroots support.

With that very real dynamic in mind, here's why it would have been a better strategy to elect Hillary perhaps *despite* her being a warmongering maniac:

**1)** Unlike GOP, Democrats like Obama and Hillary do succumb to political pressure on some major domestic issues.  They have to give in eventually - otherwise the charade of being an opposition party will be vanquished.

Unlike with the GOP, progressives and general public pressure can force the hands of corporate Democrats over time.  Once certain progressive issues get enacted this way, it's difficult even for the GOP to *completely* roll them back.  See civil rights including gay rights, cannabis decriminalization, etc.

**2)** Jimmy and Jamarl are correct - both corporate Democrats and the GOP are, indeed, war parties.  However, they repeatedly ignore the fact that there's more resistance to war by corporate Democrats overall compared to the GOP.  Through public pressure the Democrats will back down from hot wars more readily than the GOP will.

For instance, Jimmy has repeatedly conveyed the misinformation that the Democratic party voted alongside the GOP for the Iraq War.  That's completely false.  Yes, Hillary did - but most of the Democrats voted AGAINST the Iraq War resolution.  Really wish Jimmy would research it and stop with the mistruth on that.

One can cherrypick where Democrats have ramped up aggression, but even warmongers like Hillary who helped to decimate Libya under Obama are likely to face more opposition from within their own party and even the GOP in some cases.

For example, Obama wanted to escalate towards a hot war with Syria beyond the proxy war we already had.  Due to resistance from his own party, the public (and even some of the GOP!) - Obama was forced to back down.

A hot war with Syria was thwarted and even with the Republicans in control today it's difficult for them to roll back and put our troops on the ground there in direct combat.

Was there still massive bombings?  Yes, but nothing like the aggression and deaths that would have incurred if he'd been allowed to jump into an outright hot war with Syria and massively escalate as he first intended.

Hillary would have met this same kind of resistance for her own warmongering.  On the other hand, the GOP much more easily can railroad through hot wars that are vastly more deadly and much more difficult to roll back afterwards (see Iraq War).  Does this make corporate Democrats like Hillary a lesser EVIL?  Yes, but it also means less death, less suffering, less drain of our national treasure, etc. -  Sometimes LESS is MORE.

**3)** Jimmy and Jamarl keep saying there was less progress after Obama was elected because he was able to sneak through corporatist agendas more readily than the GOP can.  While it's true that corporate Democrats are able to do this to some degree, what Jimmy and Jamarl leave out is all the progress that happened as well.  There was a huge Occupy movement that forever changed the national dialog on wealth &amp; income disparity.  Before OWS there was ZERO mention of our current class war on a national scale.  We changed that and that was no small task.

After Obama, there was the huge Bernie Sanders movement that has also altered the political landscape for the better.  We proved that small donations from grassroots political campaigns are viable and powerful despite all the insidious naysaying from both liberals and even some progressives during his run.

That's huge steps forward for the USA that happened under Obama due to progressives thriving and resisting the establishment.  Not to mention things like single-payer healthcare (Medicare For All) are now quickly becoming household words for most Americans and support is rising at a historic rate.  The precursor to that was under Obama as well.

Those were all accomplished while a corporate Democrat was in power and that is some of the reasons why I chose to vote for Hillary in the general election over Trump.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Anyway, here's the main point that I think even Jimmy and Jamarl would have a hard time arguing against if they were to open up their minds a bit.  By voting in Democrats and having them take the White House, Senate and House we force their hands and stop giving them the GOP as their scapegoats for their own actions and inactions.  If we force them to win TWO Democratic administrations in a row (which has never been done in modern history!) they can no longer play the ping-pong blame game with Republicans.  Once we remove Republicans as scapegoats for corporate Democrat's actions and inactions, even the most ardent Democratic supporters are going to see through the charade and demand change.

It seems like a flippant answer to your awesome write-up, but I agree on every point.

Something I don't get about their approach is how the end game is supposed to work.  They like to talk about how hopelessly corrupt the Democratic party is, but isn't the government itself just as bad or worse?  If there isn't the political power to take over the Democratic party, where is the political power going to come from to take over the government?  They will have all the same forces working against them, and the limitations of our first-past-the-post voting system to deal with as well.

They act like the Dem-Enter strategy is akin to endorsing the current party.&gt; f there isn't the political power to take over the Democratic party, where is the political power going to come from to take over the government? They will have all the same forces working against them, and the limitations of our first-past-the-post voting system to deal with as well.

I really want to see an answer for that from Jimmy or Jamarl.  I honestly don't think they have a plan to overcome those obstacles and that's why as much as I appreciate them on many other levels, I just don't agree with their overall strategy.

Naysaying is easy, but coming up with a constructive, realistic plan is a lot of work and research.

&gt;  It's only the crazy TYT dolls dancing in your head that are crazy about the issue.

There you go, making it personal again. Why would I even reply with substance to something like this? You are incapable of defending TYT without using insults.
&gt; Democrats like Obama and Hillary do succumb to political pressure on some major domestic issues. 

No, they don't. Neither Obama nor Hillary would ever embark on a course that contradicts their neoliberal and neoconservative ideologies, the latter of which they so amply and consistently display in their policies and connections (Hillary is friends with Kissinger, Obama takes orders from Wall Street, etc.) And that's the main problem. 

&gt; otherwise the charade of being an opposition party will be vanquished.

Well, that's what the spectre of "Russia" and similar mass-manipulating tactics are for. They think they can rely on that, regardless of everything else.

Anyway, they obviously **loathe** being an opposition party, they are only interested in getting back into power ASAP...and then pick up their project where they left it off in 2016, i.e. continue their slightly-soft-edged neoliberal/neoconservative program. With some gay rights and pro-choice and Identity Politics thrown in.
&gt; There you go, making it personal again.

Yes, exactly.  It *is* personal.  You are obsessed with a show that you obviously don't watch.  I'm no psychiatrist, but you really should consider talking to a professional.

And, BTW, Ana and Cenk are people too.  You slander them continuously, then whine when someone calls you out on it.  If you are that fragile, then i suggest the best course of action would be to shut the fuck up.&gt;  I'm no psychiatrist, but you really should consider talking to a professional.

You should know that questioning the psychology of leftwing activists is a favorite rightwing tactic. It's a kind of depolitization tactic, i.e. an attempt to reduce the politic to the psychological. But my problems with TYT are definitely political (media and media ownership are an extension of politics).

&gt; And, BTW, Ana and Cenk are people too.

Those people are "journalists", or at least they are claiming the mantle, the privileges and the status of being journalists. This makes them public figures which invites a heightened level of public pushback as well as heightened scepticism. Whatever can be said of them, it's not on the same level as what we are saying about/to fellow reddit users.

&gt; questioning the psychology of leftwing activists is a favorite rightwing tactic.

I'm pretty sure that's not exclusive to the right.  In fact, I see it far more often used by the left attacking the right.  (It helps that when the left uses it, it's often accurate.). But in any case, I did not intend it as a tactic.

&gt; But my problems with TYT are definitely political (media and media ownership are an extension of politics).

The fact that they took a big investment is the only legitimate criticism I've seen you make. But then you spoiled it by falsely claiming it changed their coverage.

&gt; Those people are "journalists", or at least they are claiming the mantle

I would say they are commentators, at least in the case of Cenk and Ana.  In any case, you are also broadcasting political commentary on a worldwide network.  The only differences I see are that you lack popularity, creativity, integrity, and skilled presentation.Where is part 1?
To start off I want you to know I respect you.  Even with Jarmarl being close-minded and somewhat counterproductive in my view - I respect where he's coming from too. I think we all want basically the same progressive goals.  This is respectfully about strategy and how we get to those goals — hopefully within our lifetimes.

&gt;&gt;Democrats like Obama and Hillary do succumb to political pressure on some major **domestic issues**.

&gt;No, they don't.

While I agree that corporate Democrats don’t succumb in certain domestic areas hardly at all, I’d really like to refrain from utilizing hyperbolic absolutes in describing all their actions.  That drives people away before even attempting to reach them.  The reality is much more nuanced.   The usage of hyperbole is an old, tired, neocon-style tactic that unproductively alienates the very people I’d like to bring to the table.  The less we mimic neocons in this regard, the better.

Speaking of neocons, I see you mentioned Kissinger and Wall Street so I think you're basically referring to both foreign and domestic issues in that part of the conversation.  I’ll start with domestic.

When it comes to Wall Street we both know corporate Democrats have a horrible history.  Obama was basically a paid-off Wall Street lackey and Hillary is practically a Goldman Sachs representative for all intents and purposes.  She was a Goldwater Girl that graduated into being a Goldman Girl.

I would also agree that while Sen. Warren's showmanship is commendable, she doesn't seem to have any large impact that we truly need against the massive scale excesses and corruption of Wall Street. I do think that Warren at least keeps corporate greed in the public's eye and that's vital — but that only does so much, of course.

All that said, I think in our current dynamic, Warren is an example of how even corporate Democrats succumb at least somewhat to pressure against Wall Street whereas within the GOP there is little to none at all.  You may think that’s all just a charade (and you may be right), that's really beside my point as there's a much bigger, more important picture at play that I’ll get into later.

So, back to what I regard as the harmful absolutist rhetoric that some progressives employ.  Wall Street isn't our only domestic issue. Democrats have been, indeed, successfully pressured to change on several domestic issues. For example, corporate Democrats were attempting to appeal to religious constituents against gay marriage for as long as they could.

Obama and Hillary did, indeed, succumb to political pressure on that major domestic issue.  You later mentioned in your post above that gay rights and women’s right are “thrown in” but I think civil rights are a huge deal and we shouldn’t discount them as an advantage of having corporate Democrats in power or we just seem disingenuous.

So the absolutist, "No, they don't" is incorrect there.  The nuanced truth of the matter is that in some spheres the corporate Democrats do succumb to pressure (where most of the GOP never will) and in some cases they do not or are even worse than the GOP.

When progressives keep telling others there’s no real nuance between the parties — people tune-out and reject our valid arguments about where they **are** on the same corporatist boat before ever hearing them.   That’s not productive.

Now I'll get to your Kissinger reference which I assume is in regard to foreign policy.

&gt;&gt;Democrats like Obama and Hillary do succumb to political pressure on some major domestic issues.

&gt;No, they don't. Neither Obama nor Hillary would ever embark on a course that contradicts their neoliberal and neoconservative ideologies, the latter of which they so amply and consistently display in their policies and connections (Hillary is friends with **Kissinger**, Obama takes orders from Wall Street, etc.) And that's the main problem.

They do.  Not willingly as you seem to be inferring.  They don’t “embark” on anything progressive.  But, I didn’t say in my previous post they do so willingly on their own.  As I said, it's via the political force of public pressure. I gave the example earlier of where Obama attempted to begin a hot war with Syria.  Remember his "red line"?  He was setting us up for total war with Syria well beyond the proxy war.

Through public and political pressure, Obama wasn't able to get congressional approval for his drastic military intervention in Syria.  Once public pressure was combined with other geopolitical pressures (see Iran), Obama succumbed and was forced to back down from starting a very major war. 

*Syria would have been our next catastrophic Iraq War and public pressure helped thwart it.*

This was a historic moment in modern American history, but the corporate media sure as shit doesn’t want to talk about it directly and risk having the American public realize their own power.

The corporate news will **never, ever** bring attention to this fact, but it was one of the first times in modern American history where public pressure actually prevented a hasty, large-scale war that the military-industrial complex was already geared up and ready to profitably engage in.  The establishment is terrified of this absolutely historic event and want to erase the event from history because it showed a changing dynamic brought upon by a much more connected American public through social media at that time.

Again, Obama still bombed the shit out of Syria and that's why need to get rid of corporate Democrats where we progressives have the *ability* to do so — that's why I actively fund and support the hostile takeover of the Democratic party alongside also funding and supporting various attempts to foment viable, progressive third parties **wherever we can** in this current corporatist power structure within a heavily entrenched oligarchy.

——————————————————————————————————

See part 2 below**Now here's my main point I was making in the first place** about how corporate Democrats and Republicans are enabled to play the American public when we allow the Democrats to use Republicans as scapegoats for their own actions and inactions.

Let's start with Wall Street. The [CFPB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren#Consumer_Financial_Protection_Bureau) was signed into law under Obama, but the Republicans were able to stymie it and give it less teeth.  This is a recurring pattern of deceit.

This is exactly how corporate Democrats collude with Republicans to play the American public.  MSNBC &amp; CNN will show the masses that good, old “liberal” Obama tried to fight the good fight against corporate corruption — but the big, bad Republicans came along and screwed things up.

That's our current dynamic.  You may be "woke".  Jimmy Dore may be "woke" and I sure as hell know that Jamarl Thomas thinks he's more “woke" than all of us combined (just kidding).  But we still need to realize we’re often in a progressive bubble barking to each other about the sins of the corporatists.  Spreading the truth to others has a long, long way to go still.

Many Americans we need on our side (yes, we need them) for a true revolution are still swept up in an MSNBC-style corporate media induced fog that perpetuates the myth that corporate Democrats would help us if only it wasn't for those damn, dastardly Republicans that stunt Democrats at every turn.

These Americans are people that work their asses off and have little time for seeking out alternative sources of news media beyond the mainstream.  These are the overworked, underpaid, over-stressed people of America that at least bother to vote in elections.  These are the people that we need to reach, but it’s extremely costly and difficult to do so on a mass scale large enough to overtake the influence of the corporate media machine (this includes social media bots, deep state influences, etc. as well).

Nationwide, strong progressive activists have been *slowly* but surely breaking that dynamic through offline/online hybrid organizing in the past and utilizing decentralized activism via social media and/or comment board groups, etc.  That's partially how we got Bernie Sanders as far as he got, for example.  Also, Internet media from people such as Jimmy Dore are doing their smaller, more centralized part to educate the American public as well.

That's exactly why corporations like Google &amp; FaceBook are turning the screws on us online and the establishment is bashing our skulls on the streets.  Progressives are becoming an increasingly powerful force via the Internet and it terrifies corrupt, greedy corporatists.  If you want to look for weaknesses in the establishment, look at what they do, not what they say.  Their actions clearly show they fear the power of connected Americans on the Internet.

And……their actions clearly show they **fear** concurrent Democratic administrations as well (more on this later).

Now, if you're heavily involved in the progressive movement and regularly watch shows like Jimmy Dore, it's rather easy to get into the bubble I previously mentioned and forget the much larger forces that are still in play all around us.

A huge part of the American public still needs to be jarred from a corporate media induced haze.  Progressive activists and Internet broadcasts such as The Jimmy Dore Show only have but so much reach at the end of the day.  A lot of Americans know there’s suffering, but they don't understand the dynamic because of the corporate media shell game played upon them.

**We can smash that shell game.**

We haven't had two, consecutive Democratic administrations ever in modern history **and the establishment WANTS it that way**. We’ve also only had a brief time in modern history where Democrats have held the White House, Senate and House at the beginning of Obama's administration.  More on this very important dynamic later.

What we've had instead is a shell game where we flip-flop between admins and Democrats blame previous Republican admins for their own actions and inactions.  MSNBC and CNN perpetuate that shell game and many Americans are obviously fooled.  Corporate Democrats foster this dynamic because they can pander to the public while truly serving the wealthy donor class that truly controls them and benefits at our expense.

If you think Jimmy Dore and social media are going to crack that shell game any time soon, you've got some Youtube demonetization and an ever-ramping-up social media censorship blockade to seriously look at.  For example, Twitter is blatantly capping my growth on its platform and probably yours as well.

So how do we "reach" this huge mass of unreachable masses that we desperately need to for true revolution?

We simply don't have the money for that kind of reach…  Or do we?  I say we use the establishment's own hubris, money and power against them.  (See *The Art of War* for context).

How do we do this?  By forcing the hands of the corporate Democrats. How do I know this will work?  Because it *already has*.

I've been a part of various progressive activist movements for decades and I've personally tried countless strategies with varying degrees of success in attempts to reach other Americans about things such as single-payer healthcare and our two-party fraud.  We helped to promote the old idea of small donations from individual donors, door-to-door activism and spreading the truth about our corrupt system wherever we could.  It’s been a success, but it’s been very slow coming.

What *finally* broke through (and helped to explode the progressive messages of my compatriots and myself) was the dynamic after Obama took the White House along with the corporate Democrats taking the Senate and House.

It was after this happened that we were finally (finally!) able to jump on the failures of the corporate Democrats and not allow them to get away with blaming Republicans for being blatant corporatists.  They tried to deflect, but our message resonated because Americans were finally **seeing for themselves** what a fraud the corporate Democrats were.

How do I know this resonated?  Enter Bernie Sanders.

This dynamic resonated so well that we were able to use that power to get Bernie Sanders to reach unthinkable, historic heights within a massively corrupt, cheating system (see DNC, for example).  Did we know Bernie Sanders would win?  Nope, we knew it was a hell of a long shot to say the least, but the POINT of supporting his rise was to show Americans what a fraud the DNC was.

Don't believe me?  This is what I clearly said was our plan **before** Bernie Sanders ran for office:

https://twitter.com/Cowicide/status/933887627207499777  

It worked to some degree obviously.  The DNC has now been exposed for a fairly large swathe of Americans as being a sham.  Of course the establishment is now going into over-drive with damage control in collusion with the corporate media distraction machine to get liberals to focus like a laser on Russia hysteria, but that desperate act will only last for so long.

As a matter of fact, a huge part of the nation is already getting Russia burn-out.  You wouldn’t know that from all the social media bots that infest Twitter, Reddit and Facebook.  You wouldn’t know that from outlets like MSNBC and unfortunately TYT that blast Russia hysteria all too often — but if you look through the cracks, poll after poll shows that Americans are getting Russia hysteria fatigue despite the continuing media blitz onslaught.  Its impact will fade.

I think Jimmy Dore is making a critical mistake by underestimating just how smart the establishment really is.  He keeps referring to the establishment as stupid for running an obviously weak candidate like Hillary.  Has he ever considered that they aren’t stupid and wanted her to lose?  What better way to continue the insidious ping-pong cycle where Democrats keep getting to blame the previous Republican administration for all our woes?

This is why I want Democrats to not only have consecutive administrations, but also take the Senate and House and better yet take them with filibuster proof majorities.  It’s not because I love corporate Democrats, it’s because I **despise** them.  We need to take away their Republican scapegoats and show Democratic voters that corporate Democrats aren’t truly fighting for them.

**Corporate Democrat liberals grow through Republican failures (see the rise of Obama).  Progressive movements grow through liberal failures (see the rise of Bernie after Obama).**

A Republican administration is why so many corporate Democrat liberals are still rising up instead of much more progressives despite the catastrophic failure of corporate Democrats in the race against a serial pussy grabber.  Jimmy Dore should stop scratching his head on that one as the insidious ping-pong cycle continues.  Corporate Democrats are gaining power by using Republicans for scapegoats all over again.  The cycle continues! Progressives need to break that damn cycle.

This is why I voted for Hillary (in the general election after voting Bernie in primary).  I want the Democrats to fall on their own hubristic sword and be exposed for what they are.  No more scapegoats for a disillusioned electorate who wants things like single-payer healthcare.  Among all the other ways I’ve mentioned earlier, that’s how we take over the party with real populists and that’s how we give progressive third parties the **viable** power they need to gather supporters disillusioned with the corporate Democrats en masse.

If you, Jimmy Dore or Jamarl have a better strategy to bring down the most vastly powerful oligarchy in world history without bloodshed, I’m all ears.
I'm so happy that my city is involved in the  strike. I'm glad they have taken inspiration from West Virginia and decided to take action! Our teachers need a lot more respect and better pay. It will be cool to see Jimmy talk about this!Sjws are a real thing and this is what happened To be honest, I have little respect for progressive YT channels that seem to only cover "drama" between other progressive media.

The stock market... day-to-day has no impact on everyday people, but they make it our concern.  Another example, the unemployment rate.  This is a ruling class measurement.

They ask "are you working" And if you say no, they ask "are you looking for work"

If you say no again, they don't count you as unemployed because you "aren't in the workforce" anymore. That includes people who stopped looking because they gave up.

So they're fake to begin with, even ignoring the minimum wage issues. How this post was reacted to kind of shows me where the progressives are.

Progressives certainly aren't watching David Pakman or following his reddit.Meh, Stein isn’t a very impressive candidate. At least she won’t run as a DemocratI’m a Sanders / Gabbard man.I’d like to see her run as a dem, that’s how she will get into congress! Tulsi Gabbard is so fucking awesome! She's my hero,  what an awesome person!We need Jill Stein to run as a justice dem against Tim Kaine! So... I'm sure this is Russia's doing. I’m still proud to have voted for herI'm getting tired of this fake ass lady.i imagine the rebels or terrorists who will benefit from the US going to war with syria. i don't really know what russia has to gain from it. i guess it would give them more of a reason to start attacking US-backed forces in that area&gt;rebels and terrorists

These are the groups the US supports. Some, yes... And they would benefit from the US going into a direct war with Syria. Right, hence my suspcion of who launched this gas attack.

&gt; Former super model Janice Dickinson has appeared in court to testify against Bill Cosby in a drugging and rape case, where she admitted to making up a story that appears in her memoir in order to protect herself.

&gt; Dickinson, 63, took to the stand in a Pennsylvania courtroom that sees Cosby, 80, on retrial on three separate accounts of sexual assault.

&gt; Dickinson confirmed that she actually confronted Cosby the following day about the assault, only for him to deny it had ever taken place.

Why? The Daily Mail is known for holding controversial opinions within its articles. It should not be tolerated. The outlet also is known for being highly biased and also publishing false and misleading articles.

&gt; We have some exciting news — we're making a movie! But only with your help.

&gt; Socialism: An American Story will be a feature-length documentary about the resurgence of socialism in the United States, its vibrant and suppressed history, and why it might be our best hope of building a better world out of the misery of capitalism. 

&gt; After all, not everyone can be won over by 3,000-word essays.

&gt; Steering the project is Yael Bridge, a talented filmmaker with years of experience in political filmmaking. She worked closely with Robert Reich to produce hundreds of viral videos on progressive policy, and Saving Capitalism, a documentary feature that premiered as a Netflix Original last fall. We’ve got some great footage shot already with socialists in office Lee Carter and Kshama Sawant, historian Eric Foner, and Oklahoma teachers on strike. But we can't get this project off the ground without you. 
 
&gt; Today is the first day of our 30-day Kickstarter campaign to raise money so we can keep going. Can you please help us? Every donation helps, and we’ve got some fun rewards lined up for all our backers. If you know anyone who might be interested in the movie, let them know this is happening now!

&gt; The word “socialism” is gaining traction in American politics and it’s critical that people understand its deep roots and potential future, even in the heart of empire. We hope you’ll help!Bwhahahahaha. 

/sarcasm on/ I can't believe Joy lied to cover her a\*\*./sarcasm off/damn you citizens united........  oh wait that has nothing to do with this. well except that it makes democrats look like hypocritesAnd what's horrible is that even actual progressive democrats like Dennis Kucinich (Ohio candidate for governor.) are under constant fire and smearing.

The democratic party is just becoming socially progressive Republicans.&gt;The democratic party is just becoming socially progressive Republicans.

He is right when he says;

The corporate media (print,radio,tv,digtal) are all distracting us with porn stars, Russia, pee tapes, lawyergate, etc.  While (behind the scenes) Congress is systematically dismantling every social construct, destroying every ability for us to communicate unfettered, crushing any chance for the common family to get ahead, save for retirement and basically live a normal productive happy life. This is all being done by design, make no mistake about it. The system is rigged against us. #Truth.
Chomsky is one guy I wont ever fight on his impression of reality. I might disagree at times about what to do about it, but never about how he sees things. Everyone can use more Chomsky in their perspective imo.Yes, all my yes.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_NelsonI tend to think Bernie is the best person! But both him and Warren need primary challengers to keep them honest! Scum bag pieces of shitI think the new shows are great. I love John's True North videos. I was worried about that $20million too but it's not what op claims it is. It came from a single investor (Jeffrey Katzenberg) who is also interested in the democratic and progressive movement. There is no sign that I can see that tyt is changing, just expanding.

https://www.businessinsider.nl/young-turks-fundraising-venture-capital-criticism-2017-8international=true&amp;r=US

Edit: Katzenberg is not the sole investor according to some redditors so I'd ask you to verify this for yourself. 

Point still stands, TYT hasn't changed or soldout. Just watch a few of their recent videos and make up your own mind.&gt; It came from a single investor (Jeffrey Katzenberg)

That's deeply incorrect. It came from at least three venture capitalist firms, namely 3L Capital  Greycroft, e.ventures and WndrCo. http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/young-turks-jeffrey-katzenberg-wndrco-funding-1202518938/

Of those, WndrCo is the company that is just the private plaything of billionaire and Democratic party kingmaker Jeffrey Katzenberg.

Again, how are any of these creations "progressive"? "Aggressive Progressives" is progressive, but this is not. Feel free to attempt to back up your points.Billionaires aren't "interested in the democratic and progressive movement", you daft naive git. The whole point of being a billionaire is to wield more power in a corrupt society than the average person does. Look up "oligarchy" and "plutocracy" in the dictionary. I wish! He called Sacramento “too Republican“.just watching the live youtube clips, they seem pretty fun.. like, the crowds always seem really engaged. I don't know anything but I did notice he wasn't on the last episode I saw. It was just Ron and Steve hosting it. But I do know he had a hernia surgery recently so I just figure that's the reason why. I expect him to be back soon, whenever they tape those things.But why no live stream?  This is annoying.i wish he'd stop advertising the Saturday chat. it just makes it worse when he flakes.I thought that, but he’s still doing his show. And he is also and they tape every Tuesday i thinkHe could still advertise it but say "sometimes" rather than implying it is weekly. Hey, look over here!

That policy did not get implemented. Instead, we have the Trump administration tearing apart real families and handing children off to foster families. Including infants and toddlers. Just wanted to help Alison Hartson get the word out for her campaign. She is not getting any coverage form the Corporate Media. Hoping people will help spread the word for Alison she is an amazing progressiveI f**king love her. Always have, Always will.Thank you so much. Na, Thank her;)Links?  Context?Er, it's a Tweet. Everything you need to know is inside the Tweet. 

I mean, it's pretty short, but that's kind of the core concept of Twitter.I agree that Ana's twitter pic looks like that of a troll, but that's not really my fault.Anyway, have you seen how TYT puts its video clips up on Youtube? Every single one has a title that is deliberately designed to be at least 50% clickbait.Well that's not very nice. Are all regulars of r/Enough_Sanders_Spam so impolite?That may be but what does the Twitter account @jimmydoreshow have to do with this? I want to understand it but you'll have to explain more. 

Jimmy himself is @jimmy_dore (but he's not actively involved in this either).Still not very nice! Still very r/Enough_Sanders_Spam. Jimmy said today in the Solid Chat Saturday stream that Bernie's press secretary keeps saying that he'll schedule Bernie on the show, but that he keeps dodging Jimmy. Jimmy even offered to submit his questions in writing, but still nothing. Someone should [e-mail this](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/works/1944/1944-fas.htm) to JimmyThat we pick a day in the near future when, for an hour or so, we constantly tweet at Bernie's Twitter accounts and tell him we want him on the Jimmy Dore Show. But we need a good amount of people, so if you have friends who like Bernie or Jimmy then get them to come along, too.Me, too, why do you think he's not coming on the show?Yeah, I can't disagree with that. Maybe not fringe; he has the same policies and ideals as Bernie, but he certainly is very vicious and aggressive.I know he's said that 9/11 was a false flag, like the Gulf of Tonkin (might even be using that phrase incorrectly), but I haven't heard anything else about it nor the Las Vegas Massacre. I'll check it out, though. I’m ideological scoring puts him to the left of Roy Moore on every issue. He doesn’t want to eliminate social security and Medicare for example, or decrease the minimum wage, or eliminate the EPA, or look at the Supreme Court...What’s wrong with military spending?He will NEVER come on your show. You said Syrian children were child actors. That Syria is all about oil. Bernie disagrees and knows the facts. Not to mention denying Russian collusion. Oh god he cites TrotskyLet me guess? RT? Because the U.N. interviewed the people and examined them. They did a year long study and proved that Assad gassed his own people at least twice now.The people interviewed by RT said that. Every other report found that there was a gas attack. U.N. reports have proven that Assad gassed his own people. What, like the Kurds? The Syrian anarchists that are secular socialists? That’s the majority of our fighting coalition in Syria against a fascist dictator known as Assad.Look up Jimmy Dore on rationalwiki and go to the Syria section. You will see how much fake news he spews. It’s not even disputable. Assad has underground torture sites and gases his own people. His party, the Ba’ath party, was founded on following European fascism.Nope. That’s fake news. General Mattie said that a DIFFERENT attack was not done by Assad. He like all respected figures and studies have confirmed that Assad gassed his people.
Pipeline has been dead for years. Look up Jimmy Dore’s rationalwiki page and go to the Syria section, there is a rebuttal of the pipeline conspiracy. The Syrian people would own their own oil if Assad was overthrown by the way. Just like the Iraqis now own their own oil. Look up Iraq’s ministry of oil.He not only supports Assad, he’s also an apologist for Fidel Castro. Saudi Arabia opposed the Iraq War and the Afghanistan war against the taliban.
For Yemen, we are helping overthrow a coup that is fascistic That’s completely wrong. Mattis said that a DIFFERENT attack wasn’t Assad. Mattis and all other respected officials still say that Assad has used chemical weapons three times now. Stop listening to RT/Jimmy Dore or other propaganda outlets. Jimmy is incapable of being neutral or reporting on any foreign policy matters in regards to the facts. He would probably say we were wrong to end genocides in Bosnia and Rwanda under President Clinton. Assad is fighting for a fascist police state and he has been confirmed twice by U.N. investigations to have used chemical weapons. Assad also had underground torture and execution sites. His opponents/rebels in Syria include anarchist socialists and Kurds who all value human rights and have established democracy in the areas they occupy in Syria.
Link for U.N. report is below
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-warcrimes/syrian-government-forces-used-chemical-weapons-more-than-two-dozen-times-u-n-idUSKCN1BH18WIf you oppose the Iraq War and the war against the Taliban then YOU are on the side of Saudi Arabia! The only side that is fighting based off of religion is our opposition in the Middle East. Saddam Hussein killed minimum 600,000 of his own people not counting starvation, these are direct killings and executions. The entire Iraq War cost 200,000 lives and most of those were from our opposition’s terroristic tactics. Iraq was already a failed state and would have eventually collapsed leading to direct invasion by Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Turkey. How could anyone argue that our only mistake in Iraq was not removing the fascist regime in 1991. Iraqi Kurdistan is a massive success, flourishing with democracy and human rights and the rest of Iraq is heading in that direction. Most Iraqis supported the war as well. Saddam Hussein only had a 7% support in his country. Removing Saddam Hussein had over 80% support amongst Iraqis. Iraq was a literal concentration camp under Saddam. You have no idea what those people went through. He made families applaud while he would put scorching hot rods into their children’s orifices, burn them alive, or slowly lower them into vats of acid. He based his ideology off of Hitler as well.By default when he denies Assad’s atrocities he is supporting him. He wants Assad in power over the people selecting a leader and having a democracy. Assad has the worst human rights record in the world, worse than North Korea.Saudi Arabia is not a close ally of ours. The Iraq War and the Afghanistan War against the Taliban, our two biggest foreign policy decisions of the past two decades, were both opposed by Saudi Arabia. They also are ranked near the bottom for human rights, but they are not at the bottom and they haven’t committed any crime that justifies regime change, unlike Assad.
UN has confirmed that Assad used chemical weapons. https://news.un.org/en/story/2017/11/570192-both-isil-and-syrian-government-responsible-use-chemical-weapons-un-security
“Government forces continued to deliberately target civilians, including through the use of chemical weapons against civilians in opposition-held areas. As part of an aerial campaign in northern Hama and southern Idlib, on 4 April the Syrian air force used sarin in Khan Shaykhun, killing over 80 people, most of whom were women and children. The aerial campaign also targeted medical facilities throughout the area, resulting in a severe weakening of their ability to provide assistance to victims of the sarin attack and a consequent increase in the number of civilian casualties. In Idlib, Hamah, and eastern Ghouta, Damascus, Syrian forces used weaponized chlorine. These attacks constitute clear violations of international humanitarian law and the Convention on Chemical Weapons, the report notes, which the Syrian Arab Republic ratified in 2013 following a previous sarin attack”
[Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/IICISyria/Pages/IndependentInternationalCommission.aspx) 

General Mattis has stated unequivocally that Assad has used chemical weapons.
Here’s the actual transcript from the associated press.
““Q: Just make sure I heard you correctly, you’re saying you think it’s likely they have used it and you’re looking for the evidence? Is that what you said?

SEC. MATTIS: That’s — we think that they did not carry out what they said they would do back when — in the previous administration, when they were caught using it. Obviously they didn’t, cause they used it again during our administration.

And that gives us a lot of reason to suspect them. And now we have other reports from the battlefield from people who claim it’s been used.

We do not have evidence of it. But we’re not refuting them; we’re looking for evidence of it. Since clearly we are using — we are dealing with the Assad regime that has used denial and deceit to hide their outlaw actions, okay?”

‘It’s clear from the full transcript of the press conference that Mattis is referring to allegations of Sarin use since the US attack on Shayrat airbase, which means Wilkie either didn’t read the transcript, read it and misunderstood it, or read it and decided to claim something it didn’t say. More disturbingly still is Newsweek published the article without first doing basic fact checking on the central premise of the article.’”

The only thing Mattis said was that they didn’t have definitive proof YET that Assad had done the most recent chemical attack, not that he hasn’t done the ones in the past or that Assad was unlikely to have done this one. You like in a fantasy world where the only country that can do wrong is America. You understand that there are horrible governments out there. Assad is one of them, he gases his own people.Read the next sentence and you will see what I mean. Are they an ally? Yes. Do we push them to the left, constantly working to improve their human rights? Yes. But are they a close ally where we have similar foreign policy interests, values, etc. ? No, not at all.We had the most mild torture program, which I oppose. That’s nothing like the torture program of the Nazis or Assad or Saddam Hussein. Come on, you have to admit that the best and only argument against calling waterboard torture is that it clumps it in with the worst forms of torture. I still say it’s torture because it is, just that we have to point out those distinctions. We never sold cluster bombs or white phosphorus. Our allies in Syria used them on ISIS and Amnesty International condemned it but also said that there was no record of civilians being harmed as the area was solely occupied by ISIS. They also said that they could not confirm that it was done by U.S. allies, although that was their assumption and I don’t argue with it. Saudi Arabia is ranked near the bottom, around 15th from the bottom. They are actually above Iran. Iran is a police state with extrajudicial killings. The people get to “vote” and choose between a few people for prime minister that the ayatollah picks, and that person is not ever the leader, he always serves the ayotollah/dictator. That’s their upside compared to Saudi Arabia. Iran has extrajudicial killings and tortured and executes political opponents as well, even raping children because it’s against sharia to execute a virgin woman. So no matter how young the girl is, they just rape her, then kill her. Iran helped install the terrorist houthi rebels in Yemen against the will of the people there, ended the little democracy they had there, installed a terroristic police state and worsened sharia law interpretation. I used to be on your side before I learned about us savings millions in Bosnia and Rwanda and hearing Christopher Hitchens defend the Iraq War. Saudi Arabia’s tactics in Yemen have been condemned, but no genocide has taken place. There are food shortages so far but not mass starvation as of yet. The U.S. actually helps brings in food and gives it to both sides, even those aligned against us. You do know that a large portion of the Iranian government literally wants to annihilate every Jew on the planet and wants America annihilated next. They are suicidal as well and can only be deterred through threats of force and containment. Kim in North Korea is far more rational, and I would actually agree with the left that he is a rational actor that can be dealt with. I don’t think he wants an empire and that his only threat is to his people. I do not believe he would ever attack South Korea, which would be a suicide mission. He is ranked around 5th worst in the world for human rights, below Iran and Saudi Arabia.Also do you think U.S. foreign policy caused the Barbary Wars under Thomas Jefferson? Muslims captured over 1.5 million Americans and literally enslaved them citing the Quran. Jefferson declared war on them until they agreed to stop doing it as a governmental policy towards Americans. We never did anything to Muslims prior to this. The point is al queda opposed America for doing things like reversing our position in East Timor and ending the genocide that we armed and helped to exist.It’s not a strawman. Do you even know what a strawman is? Because that would not be an example of one. I’m simply letting you know that if we were allies with the mujahadeen it makes absolutely no sense to say that we initiated 9/11 and created terrorism against the U.S. The facts are that it is a Muslim threat to the worldSyria is not secular at all. Their constitution specifically says that all laws are based upon sharia. Assad is an Islamist that funds terrorism in Iraq and Lebanon. Religious minorities are persecuted and taken to black sites where they are executed. Actually the opposite of regime change opens the door to ISIS. Pulling out of Iraq lead to ISIS. You do know that ISIS is part Ba’ath Party and if you argue that we should remove ISIS that you ARE arguing for regime change and for removing Saddam Hussein’s Ba’ath Party from power. Interventions ending genocide in Bosnia and Rwanda were purely humanitarian. Giving aid to Yemen is purely humanitarian. Engaging in Syria is part humanitarian and partly for national security. You do know that Syria, like Iraq, is a failed state and will eventually collapse. Your policies will lead to Syria being a full quagmire with all surrounding countries invading. A regime change war now would save lives. Failed states turn into rogue states and implode while they enact violence on surrounding countries in their last days as they become desperate. You actually think that regime change is morally wrong. What about ending the Nazi regime? Was that wrong? Assad runs Syria as a concentration camp, a police state above ground and a mass torture site and mass burial below ground. He’s just another evil, despotic leader that I wish I could kill myself. You know that your policies will lead to the socialist anarchists and Kurds and other democratic, progressive groups in northern Syria to be taken over by Assad and put back under his police state best scenario, or to be annihilated worse case scenario. You know that Saddam Hussein was stopped from committing genocide against the Kurds solely by a U.S. no fly zone that we put up in the face of Russian opposition.All Libyan citizens were slaves under Gaddafi. He had private control of an entire country and treated the people terribly. The problems with Libya today are caused by the U.S. not taking a role in structuring post-Gaddafi Libya. Gaddafi would have been removed by the people without any international support to the democratic rebels as well. He was running a failed state.Congratulations! I think! :)Funny how 2 state solution, with palestine(which was rightfully there 1st) having a right to exist used to be the moderate position. What the hell happened to common sense? This current political establishment is more dangerous than any in my lifetime. Thanks for the condescention. The young lady at your "church" was palestinian? Because I always find muslims in christian churches. And I love how it's her "homeland" because she is muslim, but no problem calling it that for jews who mever set foot in it. Amazing how many crazy christians fuel that conflict in favor of Israel to hasten the end times. Religion kills. And i know the bible says it's their(the jews') homeland. Right, a book written by goat herding primitives who pray to the volcano god Jehovah[Not quite](http://youtu.be/BT5L4YU_Fl4).Provide evidence then? Everything I’ve seen that “disproves” it is from unreliable sources like Washington Post or New York TimesI agree, but i think a refugee deserves the right to wish their kids could return to where they came. Isn't that what radical right wing trump supporters want is for immigrants to go back to their country?This time with punctuation:

Lawrence O'Donnell: "Russia launched a war against the United States of America in 2016. And won."

Jimmy Dore: **"‏Remember when Russia Forbid you from covering Bernie Sanders? Oh wait, that was Phil Griffin. #DeleteUrNetwork**

John Cusack :‏ *"Helpful reminder -If ur anti fascist - it’s probably a good idea to be ANTI trump AND anti putin - (not anti Russian or American ) &amp; ANTI imperialist -see what happened there - lots of things are true at once- so stop ignoring the mountain of facts =giving cover to a fascist"*

Jimmy Dore: **"Hey everybody one of my all time my favs is following me and tweeting at me! He's a little mixed up &amp; doesn't understand you could be anti-Trump without swallowing propaganda and repeating it, but still a big day!"**Ok so Israel can't do wrong i get it. They're just managing backward savages. Palistine started the war that got them there. They deserve their open air prison. They should bow thier heads and give up what is asked of them. Shut up Cusack, and pay the 2 dollars. I have, and you are obviously a Zionist. Israel doesn’t even exist and never has, you would have to believe in something as silly as a religious text to believe that.Oh you’re a white supremacist... wow. It is Palestine you can just take a homes away from people. So white people can live there. Thank you so much for this post.  In a more sane America, this would be on the front page of Reddit instead of all the rampant, dangerous Russia hysteria induced by our corrupt military-industrial complex in collusion with their political lackeys and corporate media.

I'm starting part 2 now.All in a day's work, comrade ;)Seriously, check out some other threads I'm in.  The hysteria has reached such a fever pitch to the point where if you even attempt to introduce logic and nuance they act like crack heads losing their supply.

This is the build-up to the Iraq War all over again, but the terrifying thing is the end result could be nuclear annihilation.  These fucking idiots are falling for this induced hysteria hook, line and sinker.

They're so... far... gone...&gt; The hysteria has reached such a fever pitch to the point where if you even attempt to introduce logic and nuance they act like crack heads losing their supply.

Yeah, that's how it is. I agree of course but these discussions are also very tiring, for those same reasons. And they will probably not go away until the arrival of a purely domestic crisis big enough to take their minds of it.The more I engage with them in these threads, the more I suspect many of them aren't liberals at all.  I bet a good number of them are neocons and alt-right trolls attempting to divide the left.  Some of them just can't resist using their old, neocon tactics that show their hands to me.  It's tricky because there's certainly some liberals out there that've become their enemy and are now acting just like their enemy due to Russia hysteria — but I really think their numbers only appear much larger online due to trolling.  IOW, it doesn't reflect the majority of Americans.  At least I hope so or we're pretty well fucked and headed towards nuclear annihilation.Really? you can't think of anything else more important to put a spotlight on? I could probably think of at least 1000. Lets give a rape covering, war starting, corporatist network credibility because other networks didn't mention that war is bullshit.... wow you're an absolute idiot. Like I said where is this item on the agenda? it's not even CLOSE to the top for most people but Jimmy gives MSM crap for covering college kids who want to live at home forever. Total coward, moron and hypocrite who does exactly what he criticizes.Well I guess If the person who lived in my house before me was a piece of shit the neighbors have a right to throw rocks at my house.



This is seriously how stupid what you're trying to convey is....smh&gt; Lets give a rape covering, war starting, corporatist network credibility because other networks didn't mention that war is bullshit
 

you obviously can't read


&gt;war startingJust cause our unchecked late stage capitalism is dying and destroying everything it doesnt mean all capitalism needs abolishing.Definitely not. Only Trump's trade policy fits within Jimmy's world view (because it causes damage to neoliberal trade and aligns with Sanders' ideas about trade).

Being against Corporate Democrats doesn't make you pro-Trump. And there is a difference between being a left-populist and a right-populist (though there are also areas of overlap, of course).It sounds like he hates everybody. He hates the cops, the rich, the democrats AND the republicans, and he sure hates the America. He ought to move to North Korea and see how he likes it there.I get it. I watched him. He sounds like a commie to me. Free medicare, free tuitions, free everything for the poor. We ought to deport him back to North Korea.oh, do you mean the book in this [interview](https://www.salon.com/2008/03/13/chris_hedges/)?

&gt;While speaking out against the Christian fundamentalist movement and its political agenda, Hedges noticed another group -- this one on the left -- conspicuously allied with the neocons on the subject of America's role in world politics. The New Atheists, as they have been called, include Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins and bestselling author and journalist Christopher Hitchens -- outspoken secularists who depict religious structures and the belief in God as backward and anti-democratic. 

Because none of those guys had any problematic views, ever.And none of them are really on the Left, either. But I think Hedges is just commenting on the reality that the media tends to treat them as if they are.Harris is particularly neo-con and Hitchens was a huge supporter of invading Iraq. I just don't get OP's "irony". I should've researched it more! You're not wrong. But I still agree with Jimmy on sticking up for the indefensible. First they came for the mexicans, then they came for the right wing lunatics. Marxists are next and then anarchists, libertarians and progs.Well if they want to win they have to be like those red elephants, is what they would sayBecause their donors don’t make money from liberal policies. Simple.It's so sad to see how many on the left are applauding the shutting down of speech. When I simply commented on how Rachel Maddow is unhinged, I was downvoted to oblivion. They were calling me a russian bot. Fucking sheep, the lot of them. How someone could not see clear propaganda is so effin depressing. True. I did mean neoliberals. It's disgusting that their garbage is taken seriously. And it is presented in such a weasely way, they should be ashamed. Same thing over here in the states too. If you're are actually for the common person, god help you. The lie circles the globe before the truth get's it's boots on. I could have sworn I said OTHER THAN her focus on Trump (especially Russia).  I think you understand my English just fine.  It should be capitalized by the way. Thanks for posting this.  I was a little disappointed that no one on the panel asked the question "Who decides what is appropriate?"  For example: when steve made the point that you can't post porn on youtube due to restrictions no one asked, "Who decides what content is considered porn?".  Right now it's facebook and google that decides, but should it be?  We've all heard stories of people who have had posts taken down on social media platforms for nudity, ect... yet more popular users of that platform have posted equivalent or worse material and have not had their posts taken down, and those people who's posts are taken down have zero recourse.  There is no fair, impartial governing system in place on the social media platforms and that's what jimmy is arguing for.  I understand steve's point of view and I agree that if someone is inciting violence or is harassing others then recourse should be taken, but I am not comfortable with facebook, google, ect... deciding at their pleasure what constitutes harassment and inciting violence. [FB and the PM of Norway](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-censors-norway-prime-minister-erna-solberg-napalm-girl-vietnam-photo-aftenposten-2016-9?r=UK&amp;IR=T&amp;IR=T) got into a conflict because they censored the famous photograph from the Vietnam War because it contained nudity.That Youtuber has some kind of chip on his shoulder against Dore.  It becomes apparent if you watch some of his other videos of him.Thank you! Part of that is quotes from me and other parts not.  I did not say "Rachel Maddow does nothing but talk about Trump and Russia," but I did ask "Did she do something wrong I'm not aware of?"  So you are the one being confusing.  
I will try to rephrase my question for whatever kind of difficulty you have understanding.  
--What I already know is that she usually includes coverage of the Russia investigation in some portion of her 45 minute nightly show.  Often it is more than half the show.  Sometimes her coverage concerns Russia but not the 2016 election, such as evidence the Russians are interfering with American systems now. Sometimes she covers 'Trump' topics that aren't Russian-related, such as the border family separations.  And sometimes she covers noteworthy election stories like the Ocasio-Cortez and Gillum wins.  I only started watching her about a year ago so I know nothing about her being a "Hill-bot."  But if you want to elaborate on that or anything else about what Maddow covers or "ignores" (such as the 7 wars you mentioned), let me repeat that she has just 45 minutes per day.  Note in my edit that I mentioned the names of many other pundits, most of whom are on the air for 2+ hours a day, so I would ask you to keep them in mind.  And by the way let's not forget FOX News pundits who do virtually nothing but smear and spin.  So in short, Maddow specializes in Russia coverage, which anyone can take or leave as they choose.  I would assert that all those other guys obsess on Trump's tweets and speech phrases all day long, hour after hour, and she rarely even mentions them.  But if you think covering Russia in depth is terrible, fine.  WHAT ELSE IS SO HORRIBLE ABOUT HER THAT IT WARRANTS JIMMY DORE SINGLING HER OUT ON A REGULAR BASIS?So don't you mean she WAS a Hillbot?  That was 2 years ago.Isn't that what all broadcast/cable news pundits do?FFS, really????  "Wishy-washy"?  And you seriously think there's any chance Hillary will rise to anything ever again?  Good god, you people are worse than I thought.  Yes YOU PEOPLE, who are the Dore equivalent of FOX viewers.  Case in point: whataboutism.  Like running out of excuses for hating Maddow, trying to turn it into being about Clinton, and when that doesn't work, Warren.  Just pitiful.  My "narrative" was an open question, to which you had no real answer.  Maddow is a "Hillbot."  Got it.  Thanks.  I found Jimmy's wording to be disingenuous when he said no progressives were beating corporate Democrats.  He later weasel-worded his statement with "incumbents".  I love Jimmy, but here he's using the similar tactics of people he despises.  He muddled the waters to protect the validity of his third party strategy.  It's becoming more obvious he's also protecting his ego that's wrapped around his increasingly monolithic strategy.

It's almost as if the more Justice Democrats and other progressives make gains, the more Jimmy wants to ramp up insulting naysaying.  I agreed with most of what he had to say in this video, but Jimmy should rise above this non-productive rhetoric against other progressives.

Despite what Jimmy said, the reality is that progressives are defeating numerous corporate Democrats in an incredibly short amount of time.  Some say it's been a very long time that progressives have been trying — but not on this level.  We have a new dynamic in the last few years for a host of reasons — this includes social media organizing becoming vastly more powerful, a national dialog previously changed since #OCCUPY and the Bernie movement, etc.

My compatriots and myself were on the front-lines of those movements and I remember the liberal (and some progressive) naysayers at the time shitting on us every, single step of the way telling us we were wasting our time and wasting our lives because the system was too corrupt and too insurmountable to challenge.  Kind of like how Jimmy sounds today in this video as a matter of fact.

It's arguable whether or not a progressive third party (or group of them) will take over the nation before progressives take over the Democratic party from within. That does NOT mean I think third party supporters (which includes me) are wasting their lives trying to do it as Jimmy snidely implied that Justice Democrats (and the like) are doing.  I support efforts for progressive third party growth and find no reason to shit on it in order to prop up the other prong of attacks and strategies I support.

Jimmy used to claim that he supported progressives running against corporate Democrats from within the party and even (kind of) said that again in this video here, but then he just turned around and strongly insinuated they are wasting their lives.  It seems like Jimmy isn't for a multi-pronged attack from both inside and outside any longer and I strongly disagree with him on that.  One is lame without the other.

I think we should work on third party growth, but when Jimmy shits all over and demeans progressives who are attacking the corporate Democrats from within I don't see how that's productive. Third party growth is strengthened by progressives attacking and weakening corporate Democrats from within the party.  If Jimmy wants progressives to also help fight on the outside with third parties he supports perhaps it isn't wise to tell them they're wasting their lives and alienating the very people he wants to join with him?

I'd like to see Jimmy debunk this infographic I put together and have been sharing for a while on Twitter, etc.  He's used some of my other graphics/memes on air during his show, so I know he sees them.  Here's the history and dynamic I think Jimmy is ignoring:

https://i.imgur.com/lcYPn9W.png

We need a multi-pronged attack.  Jimmy shitting all over progressives who are fighting and making gains doesn't strengthen progressives.  If anything I could see where he's alienating progressive to move further away from his ideas and inadvertently stunt third party growth.  Jimmy should knock off the incessant naysaying and tell us what kind of advances his third party ideas are making.  Otherwise, perhaps it is Jimmy that's wasting his time and spinning his wheels — not us who're beating corporate Democrats with a hostile takeover in process while ALSO supporting third party growth?Okay, so you literally have no answer even after I clarified.  You STILL are focusing on her Russia focus, and cannot say how she is any worse than those other cable news pundits, who also cover Russia ad nauseam, and work for despicable corporations.  
So let's look at it from an alien visitor's point of view for just a moment.  There IS something about Rachel Maddow that jumps out as distinctly different from all those other pundits who have their own shows with their names in the title.  It's something that makes HER (hint) unique among those shows.  If I were an alien and didn't know what a staunch Progressive Jimmy Dore is, I would swear it was THAT thing that makes her uniquely hatable to him (and fans of his who share that tendency whether they can admit it or not).  This reddit post is just one of many ways I have tried to find evidence to the contrary, without making the accusation outright.   LOL, apparently you're the one with reading issues, if you don't get what I just said.  Here, in ultra simple English: I AM DONE ASKING 'BUT WHY?' BECAUSE THE ONLY REMAINING POSSIBILITY IS MISOGYNY.  Save your denials for Jimmy or yourself, save claims of having women friends and praising women leaders.  Look at how many chances I gave you to distinguish how Maddow is worse than all the male counterparts Jimmy doesn't rant about on a regular basis.  Link ain’t werkin sonI think Dore is still a force for good overall, but he's going wayward as he increasingly ties his ego to his monolithic third party strategy and protects said ego with disingenuous babble as we see in this video.  I hoped the statements would be an anomaly but he's repeating the bullshit in other videos as well and doubling &amp; tripling down on his bullshit.

I hope Jimmy isn't already jumping the shark, but it's beginning to look that way.  Bloated egos can take down the best of us.  Hopefully Jimmy will take a break and gather some introspection while he's still on a peak.  Otherwise, he's heading for an irrelevance cliff as progressives who're kicking ass throw him to the side as just another cantankerous naysayer who puts his own ego ahead of mutual goals.&gt;maybe just the looming threat of third party votes causing an election loss for a Democrat could be enough for them to take on a few more progressive stances

I don't agree, the only actions that's forced the DNC to take more progressive stances is through our hostile takeover from within.  When progressives run directly against corporatist Democrats, we expose them for who they truly are despite the best efforts of the corporate media to keep it quiet.

This is exactly what perplexes me with Jimmy Dore's hostility (saying we're wasting our lives) with Justice Democrats, etc.

Corporate Democrats will continue to scapegoat third parties for losses to the Republicans and stay the same.  Corporate Democrats will blame third party candidates (along with Russia for as long as that will last) for their own losses instead of having to own up to the fact that they prop up weak corporatist lackeys (see Hillary &amp; Kamala) that don't truly support populist agendas.

Jimmy repeats what I've said some years ago that, "The DNC would rather lose with corporate Democrats than win with progressives." and, "Democrats are paid to lose." — Very true, but Jimmy never quite takes it literally enough to understand the broader dynamic of just why Democrats purposefully behave this way.

Let's keep in mind that corporatists are composed of a wealthy donor class that controls both Democrats and Republicans interchangeably (follow the money).  These corporatists don't care about gay marriage, abortion rights or any other social issues that "rile up", distract and/or affect average Americans as long as they garner vast wealth in the process.

When Democrats aren't blaming Russia for losing, they're blaming third parties.  Why do they do this instead of introspection?  It's because the corporatists need an ongoing blame-game in place.  This way corporate Democrats can pretend that they *really, really* want to do good things for average Americans if it just wasn't for those dastardly Republicans getting in the way and Jill Stein enabling them.

This is what Jimmy doesn't seem to understand.

Corporatists are NOT stupid.  They learned a valuable lesson after corporate Democrats took over the House &amp; Senate along with Obama taking the presidency [after running on progressives promises none of them intended to keep](https://i.imgur.com/UdoDO2V.png).

That lesson was to NEVER get that kind of overwhelming power for Democrats again, period.  What do they fear more than anything?  **Accountability.**

Hence this dynamic: https://i.imgur.com/lcYPn9W.png

The corporatists do not want corporate Democrats to become accountable for their own actions and inactions ever again.  That’s exactly why we see Hillary marching back into the fray to throw a wrench into things.

https://i.imgur.com/7rLz4ie.jpg

This is why I support the hostile takeover of the Democratic party from within by progressives.  It's forcing corporate Democrats and the liberals who support them to show their hands as being against policies that support average Americans.  That exposure is their weakness.

This is also why as a very last resort (in certain cases) I support voting in corporate Democrats instead of allowing Republicans to win.  It takes away their GOP scapegoats.  That exposure is their weakness.

Despite Jimmy's lie that progressives aren't winning, we are and we're paving the way for third party growth while doing it.

edit: fixed few things for clarityThis needs to be posted all over the place and brought more nationwide attention until MSNBC is forced to cover it.That's 3745 patrons already (including me).Lol, I didn’t even know his sub existed, that is exactly what I would expect there.Jimmy Dore is a true dissident and speaks out against ALL the corruption which includes the banks, the wars, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer etc. 

I saw a couple of videos of Sam Seders, and it seems to be just more of the same echo chamber that is against the alt-right. In the one with Jimmy, Seder was accusing him of spreading misinformation when Jimmy suggested that democrats "filibuster" all of Trump's supreme court picks, as the Republicans did with Obama. While "filibuster" isn't the technically the correct term, (is there a word for the Senate refusing hearings of Supreme court picks?), that was grounds for Seder to accuse Dore of spreading misinformation. But it really seemed that Seder was personally upset that Dore wouldn't share his audience by having him on his show. 

Seder just came off as unfunny, not making any jokes or including any bit of humor.Absolutely, and that’s why you folks need to stick together to get ready for 2020, it’s gonna be the fight of a lifetime to get Bernie in but Bernie is just the beginning! Aside from the name calling, these seem to be the main criticisms in the clip you presented: 1. Jimmy should advocate for leftist Democratic primary challengers, rather than talking about the need for a third party; 2. Jimmy shouldn't say anything negative about Obama; and 3. Jimmy should't praise Tucker Carlson. 


1. Jimmy has leftist Dem candidates on his show all the time, he praises them, he directs viewers to go to their websites and donate. He had Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on his show for a long interview about a year and a half ago, before anybody knew who she was. In the runup to the CA primary he had many leftist challengers on like Allison Hartson, and and was very supportive of them. Jimmy had Amy Vilela on his show and was very supportive of her before the Nevada primary. So that entire critique of Jimmy is just bullshit (or "dum dum." to use Sam Seder's terminology.)


2. Analyzing when and why corporatist Dems like Obama take leftist positions is very important to the success of our movement. It certainly is important to know that Obama was for single payer in 2007, then didn't push for it during the Obamacare debate, and now is suddenly calling it a "new" idea. Why could that be? Maybe due to his alignment with Wall Street and corporate interests? Understanding what happened with "hope and change" Obama is critical to understanding how leftists can get real change. Hint: campaign finance reform, and supporting those who swear off corporate PACs like Ro Khanna and Tulsi Gabbard. BTW it is pretty, uh, dum dum, to attack the Bernie or bust POV as fruitless in the same discussion where you praise Obama's embrace of Medicare for All. 0% chance Obama would have come out for Medicare for All under president "never, ever come to pass" Clinton.


3. Sam Seder says it is bad to praise Tucker Carlson for sometimes being against war. That wasn't even what Jimmy praised him for before Ben Dixon went scorched earth on twitter a week or two ago. Jimmy played a clip of Tucker Carleson talking about wages at Amazon and the stop BEZOS act, Jimmy said (paraphrasing) "isn't it frustrating that the so-called left media like MSNBC is busy talking about Russia while a right winger like Tucker Carlson is saying the right thing on this issue." The point of the segment wasn't to heap praise on Tucker Carlson, it was a media critique of so-called leftist journalists who aren't focused on leftist issues. Lo and behold, Ben Dixon and Sam Sedar didn't have anything to say about wages or Bezos when this topic came up, and Sedar didn't even know what sparked Ben Dixon to go off, but he was still quick to throw out ad hominem insults.


I am a pretty regular Jimmy Dore listener and I've never heard him insult the intelligence or integrity of fellow independent journalists, and I've never heard him say anything negative about Ben or Sam. There is no "feud" between Jimmy and these guys, in fact they are the ones that seem to be trying to stir up drama to get clicks. No thanks. I disagree.

&gt; If you vote for a candidate you send the message that you support that candidate and EVERYTHING that candidate does and believes. You dont get to put an asterix next to your vote.

You’re right that voting sends a very narrow message.  But the act of voting is only part of a greater system, not a closed system onto itself.  If enough people talk about how corrupt both of the parties are, the parties are going to notice.  If enough people talk about how both parties are selling people out, the parties are going to notice.  And it’s of course not just the two parties but all kinds of other entities, and indeed the whole population of America.  The Civil Rights Movement didn’t make changes by voting strategically.  They made changes by being politically active, which (among other things) _forced_ the politicians to go along with some of their demands.  But of course whatever politician that finally sees an opportunity for himself and goes along with a progressive wave isn’t the central thing—the central thing is the progressive wave _itself_.  And waves like that are made by the people, always.

For that matter, it’s not like I am arguing _for_ Lesser Evil voting.  That’s not the point of this post.  For all I know it can be a great way to pressure the parties in better direction.  But you can also do a lot _more_ than that.  Politics isn’t confined to the political parties.&gt; 2 Jimmy shouldn't say anything negative about Obama

Sam Seder does seem to be concerned about being _too_ critical of Democrats.  Maybe that relates to Dixon’s claim that Dore makes people apathetic, in the sense that focusing “too much” on Democrats will encourage people to throw their hands up and conclude “they’re all bad so what’s the point”.  Seder does seem to want to police how much Democrats should be criticized by progressives compared to Republicans and right-wingers.

To their credit they’re right that one shouldn’t focus on the personal motives of politicians too much.  Yeah, Obama is a liar and out to enrich himself more than he is trying to help the country, but you have to be tactical and use his endorsement of Single Payer for what it’s worth.  That doesn’t mean that they are necessarily right in their charge that Dore focuses too much on people’s intentions, though.&gt; one shouldn’t focus on the personal motives of politicians too much

It isn't a matter of personal motives, like Obama's feelings, more like an analysis of the political and financial forces that have shaped Obama's positions and policies over the years. 


But, given that they made a big deal of saying they've realized that Jimmy Dore is insincere and only motivated by money, it is pretty hypocritical for them to argue that Obama's motivation doesn't matter, right after shitting all over what they imagine to be Jimmy's moneygrubbing motivation. They kind of jumped around in their discussion so I'll just do the same.

Firstly, the condescension is so off putting how can anyone stand to listen to these guys? I guarantee that 99% of the audience has no idea what the IDC is (I didn't until I looked it up), and then they follow it up with the "dum dum left is hindering progress and legislation". It's like they are pretending their audience is the smart and mature type that know best because they fall in line and do not question what they are told.

A large portion of Jimmy's audience are Trump voters who are just as disgusted with mainstream politics as he is. So he plays that part of his audience by not bringing focus to Trump while entertaining ideas like the Seth Rich conspiracy. There are already so many anti-trump mediums (Bill Maher, Trevor Noah, Colbert, Kimmel, Maddow) that it really isn't worth repeating the same tired rhetoric.

They say that Jimmy is getting rich by spreading his disinformation. I find that hard to believe considering that they demonetize his videos. He could become overnight if someone made him an offer to either buy his silence or his cooperation.

They say that Obama endorsed Medicare for all. "Democrats are running on good new ideas, like Medicare for all " I would hardly call that an endorsement. Remember Obama ran on single payer in the 2008 election and immediately backtracked once he was in office despite having all the political clout and momentum one could ever dream of. So it is appropriate to doubt the genuineness of his statement. But they want Jimmy to shut up about his doubts and just use that audio clip of "medicare for all" as a weapon to win votes.

I'll admit that Seder does bring up a good point about the long term impact of Trump court appointment. That it will be much hard to get states to enforce legislation if we ever do get our guys into office. But wouldn't we have that struggle with the courts anyways? Are we not exchanging one conservative corporate stooge (Merick Garland) for another?

Finally I'd just to say that they are going after a very small group of people who represent a sliver of the massive pie of eligible voters. They are voter shamers and are condescending and dismissive to anyone who doesn't fall into line and vote the way they want you to. We had something like 35% or so people turn out for the primaries. An abysmal number considering the political climate. Why don't they instead go after that 65% chunk of people who stayed home? They accuse Jimmy of spreading apathy, and instead of trying to motivate people and give them a reason to vote they voter shame those that do.&gt; It isn't a matter of personal motives, like Obama's feelings, more like an analysis of the political and financial forces that have shaped Obama's positions and policies over the years. 

Those things are definitely relevant and worthy of discussion.&gt; Firstly, the condescension is so off putting how can anyone stand to listen to these guys?

I barely have the patience to listen to them when they are talking about Dore.  It’s also their general MO for most of the people that they disagree with strongly.

I agree.  I don’t like voter shaming to begin with, but considering the size of the audience it’s definitely a waste of time.I just found an exchange on \/r/TheMajorityReport.  It starts off with an anti-Dore poster and then is followed by [this response](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMajorityReport/comments/9gxifd/whats_with_this_focus_on_jimmy_dore/e6bemkp/):

&gt; I think it’s fucked up that you’d rather play by the ‘rules’ of a rigged game rather than recognizing that, yes it is rigged (ie DNC/media blocking out Bernie and propagating Trump, Citizens United/corporate pact money, two party systems being uniquely American, popular vote does not even win elections... that’s literally not a democracy...), and working to change that as being the path to a better future. Nothing will ever change by electing the same people who do the same thing and work in unison to promote and pass corporate interest time and time again.

&gt; Why are we conspiracy theorists when we question why we have to settle for shills when we’ve seen this story on repeat for the last few decades? It’s time for change and staying in line only benefits those in power.

Notice how this comment is only focused on who to elect.  Now the other party could try to meet this poster half-way by focusing on non-electoral politics.  The other party could say that they are still in favor of Lesser Evil voting, _but_ here are some other things that we all can do in between elections.  They could concede the fruitless argument about who should have voted for whom and focused on what to do _now_ and outside of the mid term elections.  But instead they chose to post [this response](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMajorityReport/comments/9gxifd/whats_with_this_focus_on_jimmy_dore/e6bf762/):

&gt; Yeah, but you’re ignorant and stupid. Move to a middle sized country without nuclear weapons and try out your social experiment. This is not a game. There are real world consequences to your childlike wonder and insistence of fantasy political realities. Has not trump convinced you of the dangers of letting conservatives have unfettered control of the state?
Here’s [another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0n_nWidU24&amp;t=9m3s) video of Chomsky explaining why elections shouldn’t be an activist’s primary focus (also updated the OP).Aw, it doesn't matter. The Majority Report is just a tiny blip on the radar, and even fewer people know/care that it's fixated on attacking a similar-sized show to its left (because the JDS is bigger, but not radically bigger).

It's highly unoriginal, too, to spend your time attacking people to your Left. The MSM and corporate media already do that with great regularity, so you just end up looking like a tiny, lazy imitator of the Big Boys.

&gt; If other people who were advocates for Lesser Evil voting last election could point out political strategies that has nothing to do with the electoral system—activism, protests, building popular institutions, building alternatives to capitalist structures, etc.—then people who were against Lesser Evil voting last election would have other venues to pour their passion into.

"Lesser-evil voting" is not conducive to that kind of proactive attitude. It implies a fundamental trust in the system. People who vote for the Lesser Evil are, precisely, the ones least likely to get off their butts and actually do something (other than voting).
It takes chutzpah and daring to fight for a real alternative, to take over the streets, to be a real activist, etc. Lesser Evil Voting is the exact opposite of "chutzpah and daring".It’s hard for me to care so much about the Democratic Party that I become a party loyalist given the fact that I’m not even an American.You’re being unreasonable.  Jimmy can do whatever he wants.  I have my views on his tactics (which are not the same as that anarchist girl on MR, by the way) but I have no urge to ram them down anyone’s throat, or to say that he “needs to stfu”.

If people want to spin their wheels over how the other side isn’t getting it, fine.  In my opinion it mostly boils down to misunderstanding each other.  It doesn’t boil down to one group being dumb and the other one being enlightened.  Now, if I’m right about where Dore and MR is coming from it’s not like that makes any of them _correct_, necessarily.  So no, there is no “subtext” of telling anyone what they should do.  (As if I had that power in the first place.)I started watching Jimmy’s videos a few months before the election.  I watched all of his new videos for a good while after the election.  After a while I grew tired of it and moved on to other things, even though I still liked his style.  I still agree with him on most issues and his passion is unparalleled in the progressive space.  Which is why it annoys me that this stupid online feud has taken hold.  With the exception of some of the posters that I’ve seen on this subreddit in my two latest threads, I’ve mostly been annoyed with the people on Seder’s side.  [I’ve posted speculations about their intense animosity](https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/9exbns/tulsi_gabbard_interviewed_by_joe_rogan_shes_got/e5u4xet/) in case you’re interested.  My theory is that people who _hate_ Jimmy are wonkish progressives who care more about being smart than being right on the issues.

It’s fine that you think that it’s weird that I make posts about this topic.  I guess I don’t know how to prioritize my time.  But don’t think that I would care to waste my time on trying to bamboozle Jimmy or his fans.  That’s some paranoid bullshit and you know it.&gt; Idk who you think you're fooling 

This is clearly a complete waste of time.Jimmy’s focus on electoral politics puts him in a great place to understand the everyday American that has been brainwashed to think that electoral politics is all politics, and jimmy constantly pointing out that he himself is stupid let’s the audience reach full political potential by becoming more politically astute then him. Hell as an American that thought nobody could be more left then Obama becfore I started watching Jimmy Dore I now feel as it’s my life’s mission to teach Jimmy Dore about Marxism and Libertarian Socialism. I think he is doing a great job of getting people to think for themselves and to the left of him, unlike Seder who his audience “aspires” to be as smart as Seder and almost seams as they are trying to out right Seder at every turn while just being as right winged as Seder but just going about justifying their right wingedness in different flowery language.Totally agree.&gt;  He hasn’t run in radical circles. Why would he know about socialist class analysis? 

He's had Richard Wolff on, and Hedges who is a socialist of course, and many other guests who are also obviously versed in those theories, at least minimally. So he's learning.

But if he takes this too far and makes it too explicit, Cenk would stop letting him come on TYT panels. Which Jimmy enjoys doing. (I for one think he should have left TYT completely in 2016, but there are incentives and personal relationships that work against this.)Nope. Pretty sure he's categorized it as just another "conspiracy theory".A "way" is not even a "theory". That's just your superficial impression, from your own neoliberal vantage point.Rather than acting like moronic right-wingers ("lol I triggered libtards"), why not take a moment to step back and evaluate why so many progressives are turning against Jimmy?&gt; There is a group of Bernie supporters that take Bernie's "change the party from within" stance as gospel. Where has it gotten us

Like most people that support the ongoing hostile takeover of the Democratic party, I also support fomenting progressive third party attacks "from the outside".

The issue I have with some third party advocates like Jimmy is they focus a lot of time naysaying and complaining about other prongs of attack without showing any real gains they've made via their own "attack from the outside" rhetoric.

There's scores of videos where Jimmy vehemently (and correctly) bashes Democrats for being anti-Trump without stating what they'll actually do for average Americans.  However, then I'll see Jimmy hypocritically turn around and do the same thing bashing on progressives who attack the Democratic Party from the inside without focusing on just how well his third party strategy is going.

By his own rhetoric, Jimmy should be promoting the strengths of his increasingly monolithic third party strategy, but instead he's hypocritically consuming a lot of his air-time spewing vitriol against other progressive strategies.

&gt;Where has it gotten us

I don't like black and white, loaded questions that don't consider room for nuance, so I'm going to preface my answer with the fact that like many other progressives that support attacking the party "from within" — I don't treat any one strategy as "gospel".  Again, I support a multi-pronged attack from both the outside and inside — and I always have.

With that out of the way, (for just one example) the attack from within has gotten us Justice Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez bringing progressive ideas to millions of Americans.

In the process she's attacking old, pervasive, disingenuous mantras that're used against the progressive movement such as "How do we pay for it?" bullshit for single-payer healthcare.

AOC turns that bullshit premise on its head and asks pundits why they only seem to question "How do we pay for it?" when it comes to helping average Americans and not when there's massive tax cuts for the rich and spending on the military.

Case in point — 

https://youtu.be/I3wSSShwwwo?t=8m58s

That's just one example of many where progressives are making inroads by attacking the system from within.People talk about Jimmy Dore being toxic ([and I agree to some extent](https://old.reddit.com/r/jimmydore/comments/9c1o1x/democrats_bar_superdelegates_from_voting_on_first/e57c9bb/)) but Bill Maher is an outright corporatist sociopath.There certainly are a lot of vocal and active users who have become mobilized against this threat to the cause called Jimmy Dore.  There is a lot of complaining, hand-wringing, name-calling, and going over past sins ad nauseam (_Seth Rich!!_).  Overall there is a lot of heat and little light to the anti-Dore gallery; few nuggets of constructive critique in the cacophony of obnoxious whining.  But they might be able to claim one victory in the end, namely the manufacture of the appearance a mass movement against Dore which is mostly propped up by over-active, hysterical and substance-less posting:

&gt; why not take a moment to step back and evaluate why so many progressives are turning against Jimmy?

Y’all doth protest too much.Not surprised to see the more wonky progressive David Pakman have such a negative opinion of Jimmy’s recent work.  I think there’s a tendency for more wonky progressives to confuse some liberal Establishment concerns with grassroots progressive concerns.  Maybe they sometimes muddle the two together by getting a little too invested in reading analyses and opinions coming out of the Washington DC consensus.  In any case, it’s striking how he thinks that Jimmy is counter-productive to the progressive cause—a “useful idiot”, as he puts it.  To my mind that’s absurd.  On one hand, think of all the lefties and progressives that he talks to, interviews, and speaks about on his show.  Then think about the things that he either dismisses or doesn’t put much emphasis on… things like Russiagate and Republicans being horrible.  As for Russiagate, even if they were successful, what we’re talking about is on the scale of some tens of thousands [of dollars] in FB ads.  As for Republicans (the charge that Jimmy focuses too much on dissing Democrats), any progressive knows that the Republican Party is completely insane, and progressives won’t forget that fact simply because Jimmy doesn’t bring it up every video.  Now, these might seem like major strikes against Jimmy if you have your mind a little too much in the Washington DC consensus space, and I suspect that it’s easy for a wonk to end up like that.  But I don’t at all see how they are strikes against Jimmy from the perspective of a more grassroots progressive.

By the way, gotta love that condescending way of explaining that calling someone a “useful idiot” is “not an ad hominem”, geez…This video has been posted to many progressive subreddits by now, all by people who agree with it.  The video has been received well on some subreddits, but [not on r tytonreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/tytonreddit/comments/9k7vmo/david_pakman_weighs_in_on_jimmy_dorethanks_david/).  See in particular the [top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/tytonreddit/comments/9k7vmo/david_pakman_weighs_in_on_jimmy_dorethanks_david/e6xtxki/).Let’s just consider how different people promote tribalistic thinking.  One might say that Jimmy Dore promotes tribalistic thinking against people like Establishment Democrats, Republicans, billionaires, and Establishment journalists, but I think that kind of animosity is warranted and grounded in fact.  Also, he’s punching up.  Meanwhile the people who love to do the progressive infighting routine are making clips that directly target a peer in the same media space over an old debate, his (lack of) intellect, and his tactics. 

Concerning tactics, they are way too preoccupied with stoking tribalistic fires to try to start a dialogue about different political tactics.  [I myself have tried to start a conversation on what the two shows can do better](https://www.reddit.com/r/jimmydore/comments/9i8ix3/how_the_feud_between_the_jimmy_dore_crowd_and_the/). The only constructive debate that MR has had on the Dore–Seder feud has been [buried in an attack-video on Dore](https://www.reddit.com/r/jimmydore/comments/9iw6b5/the_majority_report_talk_about_electoral_politics/) as opposed to coming in the form of an outreach to the “dum dum left”.  And even in those rare moments were they start to talk about the real roots of the differences of opinion that they have with Dore—beyond Dore being “dumb”—the two sycophantic producers (Jamie and the other guy) practically fall over themselves to insult Dore’s intelligence while Brooks and Seder have to play the part of “moderates”, clearly showing that bonding and personal advancement over personal attacks is important for the employees at that radio show.  How’s that for tribalism?

Sure many Jimmy Dore fans are tribal.  And I don’t think that’s a strange reaction considering the vitriol that has come out of The Majority Report.Yeah, people don’t have to disown each other just because they disagree on tactics.What harm is there in taking down the D-party from both the outside (JD) and from within (KK, DP, etc.)? It harms only the corporatists. Let's have a third party, while progressives within the D-party corrode the corporate elements away from within.People like medicare and are familiar with it so just the branding alone is a reason to support it. Introducing something like the NHS is  a government takeover of the health care industry and that is a hard sell to Americans. Those "crumbs" could save you from bankruptcy or maybe even your life. 

I am just imagining a rally where everyone is holding up signs saying "We want a British NHS!" and how well that will do. /sSo you admit that you favor pragmatism over principles and policy? You’re basically the Hillary Clinton of this debate.

Crumbs aka a fully implemented Obamacare would cover everyone and save everyone’s life and end medical bankruptcy. Jimmy has supported many Democrats, this attack that he is some sort of absolutist 3rd party ideologue is a total strawman. 
First off, we do not have 30% profits. Obamacare capped profits, so you’re just wrong. Second off, if fully implemented, Obamacare would cover everyone and achieve universal coverage.

I agree that his plan would be great. A NHS system would be better. My point is that Bernie, Cortez and even Dore are favoring pragmatism over “principled progressive policy.” His plan does NOT eliminate profits from the healthcare industry, they solidify and subsidize profits in the healthcare industry. It has the government pay for the care of the uninsured for the profit of healthcare CEOs.

A NHS system lowers costs further than single-payer and increases quality further. And no, it is not overhead costs that lower. It is profits that lower. Medicare has a 2% overhead which pays for FOR-PROFIT healthcare. A NHS system eliminates greedy hospital CEOs etc. that make money off of people being sick. Overall, it’s about another 25% drop in cost from a single-payer system.He said to note vote for Hillary Clinton because she did not pass the purity test.Not a purity test, fundamental diagreement on issues, record, and character.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msiBZwqLhzAWhich is a purity test. I fundamentally disagree on Bernie’s Medicare for all not being good enough, his record of supporting regime change in Iraq in 1998 and then lying about being always against the war and his character of complimenting despotic, undemocratic regimes like Cuba, where Castro profits off of all of the people’s labor. Guess what? He’s still a good politician and I would vote for him if he was the candidate. 

Also Hillary had a 60% approval as Secretary of State. Once the Republicans started the Benghazi bullshit and all of the fake news and scandals began her numbers started tanking. Bernie’s would have dropped if he was the nominee as well. I mean some republicans gave a favorable view of him, but still would vote Cruz over Sanders. Sanders lost in general election polling to all Republican candidates other than Trump, including Ted fucking Cruz.You don't even understand what a purity test is. 

Hillary's record as secretary of state: worked to spread fracking globally, pushed the war in Libya (now a failed state with slave auctions), supported the coup in Honduras (Berta Caceres and many others killed as a result), presided over a failed "reset" with Russia (apparently we are in a new cold war), etc. "Dore is just strategically wrong" &lt;----This x 1000. Jimmy is damaging to the overall progressive movement by pushing strategies that have proven time and time again to allow conservatives to step in and shore up their own power by running against a split liberal ballot.&gt;"Jimmy is not the hero progressives want, Jimmy is the hero progressives need."

u/AJLEB I must respectfully, but strongly disagree. Jimmy delves far too much into the conspiracy theory/unhinged rant side of things to be the progressive "hero" that we need. Jimmy hurts his credibility, and by extension progressives in the eyes of many outsiders, when he keeps repeating ideas and theories long after they have been thoroughly debunked. I am not talking about when rightwingers say moronic shit like "we just debunked socialism", I am talking about when he does things like bring up Seth Rich in multiple videos including many after that was shown to just be a rightwing fever dream. Jimmy's rants and "strategies" line up with what rightwingers want far too often for him to be a true progressive hero."It harms only the corporatists." False. It harms everyone who will be harmed by the fleet of right-wing wing-nut judges that conservatives pack into the courts when the liberal vote is split. It harms everyone who will be harmed by the laws that conservatives push through when the liberal vote is split. It harms everyone who will be discriminated against by conservatives who feel emboldened when the liberal vote is split. It harms everyone who will be poisoned by the environmental problems that conservatives choose to ignore in favor of fairytales when the liberal vote is split. etc etc etc

&amp;#x200B;No, I support Medicare for all. Bernie also supports a full implementation of Obamacare, such as a stronger individual mandate penalty, greater subsidies to individuals and Medicaid expansion. 

Doctors make more in the V.A. while it costs less than Medicare does for a higher quality of service, dollar for dollar. Obamacare also cuts costs. Healthcare costs went up 12% a year under Bush, then 5.5% under Obama after Obamacare was implemented.

Your entire argument about how they will say “X” about a NHS system would apply to Medicare for all as well. All I am saying is that we all agree that pragmatism is a good thing, at some level.100% False. Bernie did worse than Hillary against all Republican candidates other than Trump. Here’s a fact check that shows my statement to be true.

https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/26/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-he-polls-better-against-gop-ca/Hillary also pushed clean energy globally and domestically. Fracking is a positive change from coal by the way and should be encouraged for countries that use coal still. I could use an analogy comparing fracking to e-cigarettes. 

Libya would have been like Syria if we did not act. Gaddafi stated that he was going to massacre all dissidents whether they took up arms or not. Under the Geneva convention, we had to act. The rebels would have never surrendered, leaving it in a Syria-like situation where the government slowly massacres all of the opposing side. Either the vast majority of rebels would have been killed in Libya, or Gaddafi’s regime. Not doing a small scale Marshall plan like we did in Iraqi Kurdistan, which is a huge success today, is a separate mistake in Libya. The U.N. says that we saved over 200,000 lives in Libya. Russia was pushing towards a Cold War before Obama got into office. Bombing Georgia for example, trying to put in a dictator.If you don’t vote for them, it sends a signal that they need to move to the right since they are not being rewarded for being to the left of the Republican. Obamacare capped healthcare profits, you do know this, right?Obamacare outlaws shitty healthcare aka junk plans and caps profits. It creates a healthcare bill of rights in all healthcare plans. The health insurance industry was more profitable prior to Obamacare. 12% healthcare cost increases per year under Bush. 5.5% under Obama after the ACA was implemented. And capped profits. I am saying that Bernie is a good candidate. But that he too uses pragmatism and also he supports voting for Democrats across the board.

And no, healthcare CEOs profits are not affected at all by Medicare for all. You’re thinking of Health INSURANCE overhead being lowered drastically. Hospital CEOs etc are all going to be making profit more so than today under Medicare for all.That’s what I said. Bernie did better against Trump than Clinton. Clinton did better than Bernie against all other Republican candidates. Bernie lost to even Ted Cruz in polling.I'm sure it's great, I would love to have an NHS equivalent here in the US. I am saying that it would be a much harder *sell*, to both the public and to the medical industry than implementing medicare for all.&gt;So you admit that you favor pragmatism over principles and policy? You’re basically the Hillary Clinton of this debate.

I am not as left as you on this issue, so yes, that would make me the Hillary Clinton here.

&gt;So you admit that you favor pragmatism over principles and policy?

The principle is for everyone to be medically covered. The policy is called medicare for all. Is there any reason not be pragmatic when it is aligned with your principle? Sure an NHS sounds great, but unless we have a complete socialist takeover of the government it won't ever happen. 


The U.K. doesn’t have a socialist government and never has. And you can achieve universal coverage without Medicare for all but I’m assuming Medicare for all is non negotiable for youBecause the Republican, to their right, won the election. He lost to Cruz in that poll.

https://www.scribd.com/doc/293784795/Public-Policy-Polling-national-pollThe REPUBLICAN WON. It makes no sense why you would move to the left if people voted for a candidate to your right.That was after Cruz lost momentum in the primary and Republicans rallied around Trump. Hillary had a 60% approval as Secretary of State and look what the GOP did to it, just in the period before the primary started.He gets SO indignant and offended when people suggest his "hiking trip" in Iran was a little fishy. But he was comfortable working undercover for his private prison expose. And he pushes establishment US foreign policy. 

Not saying he for sure has ties to the CIA. Just saying his angry denials, and flipping accusations back at whoever questions him, come across as "doth protest too much."What did they take away?  The article doesn't mention down sides.She lies roughly the same amount as Bernie Sanders according to politifact. She also supported regulating banks lol. She adopted over 90% of Bernie’s platform and Bernie said she was running on the most progressive platform in U.S. history. And yes she was a good candidate, she would have done better than Obama in 2008.Yes, that is what I am saying. There’s no evidence that people are staying home because they think both candidates are right-wingers which is 100% False. Hillary Clinton was a social democrat, under the same tent that Bernie Sanders’ ideology also is. In terms of international politics, there was very little difference between them. The difference between 40% public sector GDP ratio or 45%. Under any definition that puts Hillary Clinton as right of center, I’m assuming you’re using international ideologies to get to that, Bernie Sanders is also right of center, a social democrat.Doesn’t matter if that’s what 70% want. They vote for Republicans. Maybe they prioritize abortion over healthcare, etc. And yes, when democrats can’t win elections with liberal candidates (1984. 1988) they will move to the right and win.Yes, you are ignorant politically. If you cannot explain the large differences between the parties and presidential candidates, you have failed the most basic understand of U.S. politics.That’s not a crime. Explain what crimes she committed and why she was not prosecuted by Trump. You really do fall for FOX news bullshit, don’t you? And she supported increasing regulations through Dodd frank. That’s not “against regulations” like Trump and all Republicans are. Obama represented the coal industry as a senator because they were a powerful lobby in his state. Same with Hillary as Senator of New York with banking. Same with Elizabeth Warren now representing medical device manufacturers. Obama didn’t as president. And glass stegall repeal is not a problem if other things are in place, such as oversight, regulation of all activities, and anti-trust enforcement. The repeal of glass steagall was based off of looking at Canada’s superior banking system which has no glass steagall. I do support glass steagall, but it doesn’t do as much as you think. I wouldn’t use a glass steagall rule on public banking if we had socialized banking for example. Because merging assets can be beneficial. Risky, but beneficial.Then you need to move to Alabama if there is no difference. Ideological scoring alone proves you dead wrong. And creating a power vacuum around the world to be filled by Saudi Arabia, Iran, China and Russia is a terrible idea. You cannot have international law or human rights without the U.S. military enforcing it.

Republicans are vastly different than democrats. Look up welfare benefits by state, minimum wages, environmental protections by state, criminal justice issues, taxes on the wealthy, public subsidies for housing, Hell California even has a state level social security system, Colorado has a pure cash transfer program for poor people, state funding of education, Republicans privatize even roads and bridges, prisons, privatize public education, cutting state funding of colleges, support for higher education right to unionize a workplace which republicans end with right to work (for less) laws. Look up how each state uses block grants for example. Parts of alabama don’t even have sewer systems. 

Two good examples are, one, how the GOP left California in 2011, rising poverty, declining wages and slow GDP growth. Now? Went from nearly 18% to 13% poverty, fastest declining poverty in the country. Fastest GDP growth, 4.3% annually. And fastest wage growth in the country, 7% annually and once adjusted for inflation, 4.3% real wage growth per year, the best in the country.

Alternatively, look at Republican Reaganomics at the state level in Ohio, Michigan under Scott Walker or Kansas. Tell me it is the same and you are fucking delusional. Republicans are HORRIBLE. They are so fucking bad, way different than democrats.That show was July 15, hope that helps you narrow it down.

I don't see the contradiction, it's more like complementarity.Like any Irishman's lifelong dream, he finally gets to make that trip to Italy. :)YouTube is hiding this comment, so I'm going to repost it here:

Corrupt corporations utilize powerful, expensive mass communications to maintain a hostile environment for progressives. In contrast, they garner this massive reach to maintain a fertile ground for corporate Democrats and Republicans to thrive and do their bidding.

Their power all hinges on perpetuating a big lie.

The big lie they are actively promoting is the illusion that corporate Democrats would fight for average Americans if only Republicans would stop hindering them.  The truth that tens of millions of Democratic-leaning and independent voters still don't know is that the corrupt Democrats very much collude with Republicans to perpetuate a system that works against them.

Within this environment both organizations can do the bidding of the wealthy donor class while the public is indoctrinated to believe there are two warring parties stuck in gridlock when it comes to creating beneficial policies.  The big lie is neither party has any such intentions and collude with each other to keep it that way.

Attempting to expose this big lie and compete for national reach against the massive infrastructure of a multi-billion dollar media machine that's been entrenched nationwide for decades is possible with grassroots small donations — but it'll take decades of slow growth at best.  That's time the people and planet don't have.

My plan is primarily about outmatching this widespread national reach and influence of multi-billion dollar corporate media machines that successfully indoctrinate tens of millions of Americans against their own best interests.

This strategy creates a habitable atmosphere nationwide for progressive third party growth alongside a hostile takeover of the Democratic party from within by progressives who refuse to accept corporate donations and support policies that benefit average Americans.

This image below shows the political dynamic that the corporatists damn well do not want progressives to understand, nor exploit: 

https://i.imgur.com/lcYPn9W.png

As clearly shown within the image above, corporate Democrats thrive on a cycle of public discontent with the Republicans.  In turn, progressives and progressive movements thrive on public discontent with the corporate Democrats.

That's exactly why in recent years the corporate Democrats have been literally losing on purpose to "maintain the balance" between the power of the two parties.  The corporate Democrats do NOT want to be put into a position of transparent responsibility.  They desperately need for the Republicans to be maintained as a scapegoat for their own actions and inaction or their shell game will be exposed nationwide.

We can continue to spin our wheels for decades attempting to combat the multi-billion dollar influence of the corporate media — or with my strategy we can expose corporate Democrats to tens of millions of Americans who will see for themselves within 4-8 years what even a nationwide media machine cannot hide.

Indoctrinated people are a very tough nut to crack on an individual basis, much less en masse.

The fastest, best way for progressives with very limited money and resources to be able to reach tens of millions of indoctrinated voters and circumvent their egos is by inducing an environment that allows these voters to see how things are for themselves.

This terrifies the establishment and their consistent, recent track record of corporate Democrats very purposefully losing to Republicans on purpose — proves it.

- cow﻿Also a former member and fully agreed.No worries, it's not going anywhere - because this isn't a TYT board. :)

I'm a big fan of Jimmy's and simultaneously deeply exasperated with what TYT has become.I certainly agree that the original would have been better. Unfortunately I can't find it (normally, it's accessible only to paying subscribers). So we're stuck with various types of edits (none of which are mine, needless to say).

Secondly, Steve Oh is like Cenk in his style of arguing: he always starts out by saying "I agree with you" to the other guy - just to give the appearance of conviviality and rapprochement - and only *then* do we find out what he **really** thinks in what follows, which is invariably a contradiction of the former statement; if we're lucky a subtle contradiction but sometimes a radical contradiction (and this case is more like the latter).I never put a timeline on Jimmy's exit. I still think it's inevitable, probably around an election.

It's like TYT's next corporate funding round: go ahead and try to put a timetable on it, but it can't be done because TYT's viewers don't have any inside information (or would that be 'insider trading information'?).

I don't care that you reflexively defend them, no matter what they do. Since I have a pretty good idea of where they are headed.If you have the original, feel free to put it up. I can only reference what people put up on Youtube.&gt; And it started to feel really inconsistent for TYT's members to demand accountability of everyone but TYT itself.

Yeah, members are not very good at consistency and applied principles, to put it mildly.

I admire how you put a lot of research and references into the above text. Strong work, good sleuthing.You're being accurately informed that James and Oh had a heated argument about free speech. That's true regardless of any and all edits. 

And, like the other poster already said: "I agree with Jimmy in every single version of the video being bandied about"."The three phases of TYT"...someone ought to put that into long form (or video) so we can educate TYT's current audience with it.&gt; The 3rd one (started with Trump) is one of hyper partisanship for all of the Democratic Party votebanks that are strictly identity politics based. That is basically the left equivalent of Rush Limbaugh's audience. 

I'm not sure about the Limbaugh analogy. Isn't he more about relentlessly pushing the Republican party towards the (extreme) Right than he is a party loyalist? Though admittedly I never wasted much time on Limbaugh.

&gt; I mean seriously, how many botched shows, half-baked ideas, aborted spinoffs, etc, ARE there in TYT history?

If you look at it from the broadest perspective, it's like they do nothing other than throwing things at the wall just to see what sticks...but never putting much effort into these attempts, and never hanging around very long to see whether it sticks. Also never caring about TYT's overall consistency, building up a reputation for being fleeting to the point of hypocrisy, or about their own reliability as a stable source of information.
Please take a step back and look at what you are saying: a group of socialists disagrees with you on one stance and suddenly they are establishment? Do you not see how crazy that is?A) your statement that "every field reporter" says that there is no evidence is patently false. Seth Doane for example.

B) In response to "Why is bombing the answer to bombing?": you do know that there is a middle ground right? You can say that Assad bombed his own people without immediately saying that you have to bomb him back. Admitting that Assad might have bombed his people doesn't require saying that we need to bomb them back.What a bunch of insulting, pretentious, straw man garbage against Jimmy and his viewers.  Even if I agreed with this bullshit I would still choose to no longer support NYC-ISO due to the fact this is an absolute blunder of a political move.  A shitty move even beyond the fact this sets them up for suspicion that they've been infiltrated by the military-industrial complex as a warmongering tool.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

edit:

NYC-ISO is dead to me me.  FUCK THEM.On an extremely serious point. What kind of a self-respecting socialist would attack other people for being too anti-war? THAT is the craziness here.

It's one thing to be a socialist and try to adopt a complex and nuanced position on foreign policy. That's fine (but most socialists in the world still tend to be strongly against military intervention abroad, with no ifs or buts). 

But it's quite another thing to attack other leftists for being too anti-war. That's nuts.Agree or disagree with Coffin’s arguments on electoral politics and direct action, I think most of us here can agree with him that it’s counter-productive to  shame non-voters and people who vote.&gt;They are calling his channel a conspiracy theorist channel

Jimmy Dore is clearly a conspiracy theorist. Whether or not you agree with his theories doesn't change the fact that he has a ton of theories about false flags, cover-ups, etc (ie conspiracies)&gt;Did you know there was a government conspiracy to launch an unprovoked attack against Iraq and a whole bunch of insiders knowingly lied to get us into that war?

Of course I know that. That has no bearing on whether or not his other theories are right (Seth Rich, Syria, No Russia, etc)

&amp;#x200B;Your way is the one that led directly to Trump, across a period of 30 years (starting with the Clintons' neoliberalization of their party in the late 80's).

This way, you only get Worse Democrats - and as a result, Worse Republicans. Everything always keeps shifting towards the Right, towards more neoliberalism. 

You keep putting in more "Lesser Evil" Corporate Dems - every time more similar to yesterday's Republicans - which actively invites Republicans to keep shifting to the Right of those Dems and to become more crazy. The natural result is that the system keeps getting more corrupt and eventually starts to implode.Lesser of two evils is still evil, but if the choice is 100% evil or 60% evil, you’re  better off with 60%And what is your theory with putting Republicans into office? That suddenly the Dem Base voters are going to vote for a 3rd party candidate?So you think Hillary would have packed the courts with Conservative theocrats who will spend the next 30-50 years ruining lives?What do you think will happen while a 3rd party option is growing if the GOP is still strong? Election 1 51:45:4, Election 2 51:40:9, election 3 50:35:15, e4 50:30:20, e5 50:25:25. E6 50:20:30, E7 50:15:35, e8 48:9:43, e9 48:3:49....People won’t magically switch parties in an instant, the GOP would dominate for the majority of the rest of many of our lives under that scenario. Now imagine pushing in the primaries while later supporting the candidate who emerges with the best shot at winning. The vote wouldn’t split and deliver the election to the GOP, and we would force the candidates left in the primary just like the GOP base forces their candidates to the right.So you are completely fine with that attitude resulting in a Republican winning that election?So you would be fine with someone even worse than Trump being President by 1 vote if you voted for the “person who (you) want to represent you, whether he’s going to win or not”?They would be better off with a pro US puppet government rather than a bus driver as head of state&gt;Once the threat to the world posed by the GOP is neutralized, then we rally behind a non-Dem left candidate. When the GOP is reduced to 15% of the vote, then it won't matter how many votes either left candidate pulls from the other, because we will have removed the possibility of a GOP candidate winning. 

Never going to happen. Just by being the party of anti illegal immigration, tax cuts, pro life, etc. they will always garner at least 40% of the vote barring an apocalyptic scenario.

&gt;Everyone can acknowledge that the 3rd party candidate is FAR less likely to win than either of the other candidates. This example's 3rd party candidate is to the left of the Dem, and they will likely only be pulling from the Dem candidates voters and not the GOP, thus increasing the odds of the GOP candidate. 

I highly doubt stein voters would've voted for clinton. You just assume they would. We all knew stein had no chance, it was about getting her to 5% so she'd get federal funding.

We know that republicans are bad. But the difference between them and the democrats is that democrats will stab you on the back the first chance they get. Who would you hate more, your enemy or your "friend" who betrays you? And then shame and blame you if they lose. Democrats are doubling down on their "were not trump" strategy and it may cost them the midterms. And wouldn't it be nice if they did? They'd lose all legitimacy and the two party system would collapse. Maybe then we'd have a real democracy instead of two halves of the Corporate party playing us all for fools and squeezing the middle class to extinction.



No liberal or progressive should be ok with what Trump is doing.I said "So you would be fine with someone even worse than Trump being President by 1 vote if you voted for the “person who (you) want to represent you, whether he’s going to win or not”?" You said "Yep. I'm ok with Trump winning. That's how democracy works: you sometimes lose." and "But I'm also not gonna cry over something that can't be changed. He's still our president, like it or not." The point in my Hypo is that your decision is the reason that he wins, thus, you are at fault and could have changed it. If I vote for the candidate most likely to beat him/GOP then I know that if they lose I did everything that I could. If you and people who think like you vote for a 3rd candidate you don't know when you cast the vote that you aren't setting into motion a Republican entering into office. You are ok with that risk, I am not. I see the GOP as an existential threat to both the future of our planet and an educated and civilized society. No democrat is going to pass laws to take us closer to a theocracy, no democrat is going to push unscientific bullshit because their base believes in a sky fairy, no democrat is going to wage a crusade (look up Bush's quotes in regards to the Iraq War), no democrat is going to roll back civil right for minorities, no democrat is going to try to restrict the rights of minorities to vote. The GOP has, is and will continue to do all of those things, and for that reason no amount of risk of increasing the odds of them entering office is worth it to me.&gt;You think I am the reason Trump won?

Do you not know what a "Hypo" is?&gt;No one wanted Hillary OR Trump, but if we have to choose between them, clearly Trump wins.

How can you call yourself a liberal or a progressive when you say shit like that? &gt;I sincerely doubt anyone that calls themselves liberal or progressive actually voted for Trump.

The point is that you don't have to vote for the Republican to fuck things up and put the Republican into office. Wisconsin in 2016 shows that 3rd party left-wing candidates can fuck things up and result in an entire state going to the GOP. Trump got 1,405,284 votes, Clinton got 1,382,536, a difference of 22,748. How many votes did Jill Stein get in Wisconsin? 31,072, almost 10,000 more than Clinton needed to win Wisconsin. Let's look at Michigan: Trump got 2,279,543 votes, Clinton got 2,268,839, a difference of 10,704. How many votes did Jill Stein get in Michigan? 51,463, 40,000 more than Clinton needed to win Michigan. Let's look at Pennsylvania: Trump got 2,970,733 votes, Clinton got 2,926,441, a difference of 44,292. How many votes did Jill Stein get in Michigan? 49,941, 5,000 more than Clinton needed to win Pennsylvania. Wisconsin has 10 electoral votes, Michigan has 16, and Pennsylvania has 20, making those 3 a combined total of 46 electoral votes. Hillary Clinton received 227 electoral votes in 2016, if you moved those 3 states' 46 votes from Trump to Clinton, Hillary Clinton would have become our President with 273 votes. You might not like it, but those Jill Stein voters fucked us all by not voting for the candidate who could have actually prevented a Trump Presidency.&gt; And what is your theory with putting Republicans into office?

A few isolated Republican victories are preferable to the whole political field shifting towards the Right over a long period of time, which is what has happened as I described above. The longterm picture is the one that always matters, not the shortterm one.

For example, if Bill Clinton hadn't been elected to a second term (i.e. an act of Lesser Evil voting, if ever there was one) his whole strategy of turning the Democrats into the "pro-business, Law &amp; Order, white collar, welfare-cutting, balance-the-budget, Neoliberal" party would have been judged a failure. Thus Democrats would have remained (more of) a working class party that operates temporarily from the opposition, and the whole dynamic of the political field shifting towards the Right over time would have been suppressed...the ultimate consequence of which being that today's problems would now be far less serious (not least our problem of having to rescue the DP from billionaires and its own conservatism.)

Still waiting for Ana Kasparian to come running to the rescue.  When many progressives warned her that giving sociopathic TechBro technocrats too much power to censor us would backfire, she said that she'd cover it and protect us all...   Still waiting, Ana.&gt; we also shouldn't be trying to paint Assad as a good guy

Jimmy Dore hasn't done that.  Jimmy has **repeatedly** said that Assad isn't a good guy.  The NYC-ISO is full of shit and that makes them incredibly suspect.u/Inuma and u/AJLEB I definitely don't think that Clinton would have been even 75% ideal, but I personally think that overall she would have been better than Trump. Trump is guaranteed to pack every level of the federal courts (district, appeals, supreme) with conservative theocrats, Clinton would have given us a chance to avoid that. Even if she nominated 75% fuckwads, that is still better than 100%&gt;She gave us Russiagate since she lost to a game show host.

Well on that point we disagree. I think that there is more than enough evidence to acknowledge that Russia fucked around with our election and manipulated the uneducated and mentally inept (ie conservatives)

&amp;#x200B;&gt; So grandstand about conservatives while ignoring Obama's "legacy" didn't do enough for the people of Michigan while he wanted to push the TPP that decimated their jobs. Trump is the new Nixon after LBJ.

I have not mentioned Obama at all. Saying that Conservatives are worthless trash who we would be better off without has nothing to do with how good or bad I think Obama did as a President.Also, that "Shattered" link that you provided is to an article by a guy who wrote "[How Feinstein is conspiring to destroy Kavanaugh](https://nypost.com/2018/09/22/how-feinstein-is-conspiring-to-destroy-kavanaugh/)" "  
**Carter Page: The FBI ruined my life" "**  
**Dianne Feinstein was an easy mark for China's spy""**  
**Twitter is run by Democratic donors and activists" and others so congratulations on spreading BS rightwing propaganda**Well, I think The Daily Show was really good, but people walked away thinking it was just comedy and nothing needs to be done. It seemed that only hard-core political nerds were capable of realizing how potentially dangerous the content from the Daily Show could be, if one chose to make use of it. With the Jimmy Dore Show, I think people walk away thinking that they need to do something about it. Plus, the Dore Show is actual news mixed with some comedy, and it's straight-up dangerous at times, leaving the viewer no doubt that they're hearing things that our benevolent overlords don't want us to be hearing. This isn't playing around anymore, this is the real deal.If you call yourself a progressive, but you can't see that Republicans are far worse than Democrats, then that is a problem.If you call yourself a progressive, but you can't see that Republicans are far worse than Democrats, then that is a problem.I am not ignoring any hypocrisy, I am just capable of acknowledging that the Republicans much worse given how they are dead set on rolling back civil rights for LGBT and racial minorities, that the Republicans want to impose their own version of Christian Religious Laws (a la Sharia), that the Republicans want to do away with the social safety net, that the Republicans want to go back to the pre-ACA healthcare landscape and allow discrimination for pre-existing conditions, that the Republicans want to do away with workplace protections and labor unions, that the Republicans want to do away with what meager pollution controls we currently have and that Republicans would completely remove corporate taxes if they could among many many many other horrendous things. Is it great that many Dem politicians only want to raise corporate taxes by 5% at most? No, but it is a hell of a lot better than the Republicans wanting to remove them entirely. &gt; We have no stake in such a race.

Clinton would not be dead set on destroying the environment. We ALL have a stake in making sure that the party that doesn't deny climate science in favor of a 2000 year old collection of fairytales is the one put into positions of power to actually do something about it.I’ve been trying to get jimmy to mention this sub so more ppl would join. 

Everyone reading this email jimmy@jimmydorecomedy.com and tell them to plug this sub so it will grow. It is by far the superior place for long form discussions.We're just going to have to have badass conversations after each show then, aren't we? Also, it's possible to paste the transcripts from YouTube's automatic generator, but that one doesn't organize into paragraphs plus gets some words wrong, so it will require a little work by people. I'm wondering though if there's any copyright issue with pasting the transcript of each show into here, so does anyone know about that?Here's the transcript copied from youtube, which needs to be reorganized into sections of each person speaking, and then into paragraphs. Here's the first chunk:

hi everybody welcome to jimmy dore show we have special guest donald best is with us he is considered one of canada's most methodical and well-documented whistleblowers he was a police sergeant for over 30 years before becoming a journalist filmmaker and an anti-corruption advocate he spent 63 days in solitary confinement for exposing corruption and he's here today to tell us why please welcome to the show donald best hey doll how are you great Jimmy alright we like we like whistleblowers and people who are fighting corruption so before we get into your work you know I want to know what you're a police officer who was assigned to investigate and arrest corrupt police officers now that's so much my career yes I can't think of a more dangerous job than that you deliberately hunted down and arrested your fellow police officers first of all why did you accept such an assignment and how badly you were you ostracized after your role became known by other police officers well Jimmy you have to understand that that organizations like the police and the judiciary and lawyers and so many powerful professions if they don't place themselves well but basically all goes to hell it gets rotten it gets corrupt very very very soon and I found myself earlier in my place career finding that's I've seen things everybody sees things and the pressures on do not say anything and if it's a small thing and you're new you have to let it go up I'm sure it's that way in journalism I'm sure it's that way in medicine it's not with a lot of professions but then you see more and more and you have to make a decision some people decide to ignore it some people decide to be willfully blind but when you do that you are empowering the corruption but responsible for it somebody has to have the courage to do something but everybody's got integrity but integrity is a little good without courage so there were a few of us and they put us into a corrupt squad a squad where there were rumors about organized crime about these same squad members hanging around with socializing with receiving money women all in exchange for looking the other way while organized crime did what it does so we were infiltrated into that squad three friends that I asked by the chief to go in nobody was told not even Internal Affairs we worked there for a year we pretended to be corrupt we took the money we took the parties we had to bring our own and women undercover police officers we couldn't take the women but some of the squad members who weren't working with us they took all of it and at the end of the year we had to start arresting people and she I mean it's hard you go to somebody you've worked with you there there on the job you do a search for it at their home on a Saturday morning and their wife and children are there you're arresting them and the poor wife she doesn't know what's going on the children like you have to do it it's hard it's very hard personally it's hard emotionally as fired and yes for us precisely it's not the point where we couldn't park our cars anywhere downtown it personal vehicles they would be trashed some of them some of the guys did have their cars trashed there were threats against place families about stance for me some things I can't even I don't want to tell you about them they're just too too awful and messy so it's a mass normal so Don it sounds like you were like a regular you're a Canadian version of a Serpico was who we had here in America in the 70s and he infiltrated well he didn't infiltrate he was a cop who exposed that they were on the take right so they were taking money for drug dealers and organized crime and as long as you took the money everybody was okay so you decided so so you like so there was another movie in America was made called was the Prince of the city it was about this kind of thing and so you're taught you're telling me that you actually had personal friendships with these people how could you not you're working with them every day and then you have to turn around at the end of a year and start arresting them and you know and and you were so you caught a lot of flack from other cops you were ostracized you were messed with why aren't why aren't cops more open to reforming criminals I mean if their whole idea of being a cop is you're gonna fight crime why are cops in general like as a as a culture why are they against people like you whistleblowers who expose criminals inside the police department it's the same thing with journalism it's the same thing with medicine it's the same thing with law most people are decent good people they set out they join these professions to to change the world for good we all go into it right eyed and bushy tailed but such sense dreams of what we can accomplish but that then we start to see the corruption in each of those professions and I'm sure many more and most people remain honest but they don't do anything to stop the corruption now whistleblowers are slammed down all over the place in every profession police is no different except police have guns and they have a lot of power and they have access to information same with lawyers judges a lot of power access to information they can ask all the police officers other agencies I to target individuals who they don't like they can they can make it seem legitimate and it's very dangerous go after people who are in positions of power yeah I know but I'm so I'm so what so you know these people you say join the force with these good intentions but it just seems like no matter where there is an investigation trying to root out criminality inside the department whether it be in Canada or in the United States or anywhere it seems like as a as a culture the police they push back they're not really supportive of it so so is that just normal for people to try to protect their own is that what is that what it is or what do you think I think that is I think it's quite normal now of course in some professions the stakes are very very high take law take being a judge even even in the operating theater in a hospital how many surgeons who make mistakes or show up with alcohol on their breath or before ordered right away nurses look the other wayNext chunk:

doctors look the other way it happens all the time but if it gets to a certain level somebody has to do something about it and most people don't so yes Jimmy there are corrupt cops and the corrupt cops often act and operate with impunity for long periods of at the time I'm saying it's the same in law it's the same in the courts so let me talk about so how many people did you arrest I mean for this and in this duty arresting coming home other police officers did you arrest okay personally I arrested I think three or four police officers personally also members of organized crime who were were caught up in it had bribed us I think was it doesn't but in the end I believe that there was above a list of a hundred people now these were police officers there were some crown attorneys found prosecutors or there there were some politicians at various levels government and there was one or two judges - well I better question the better question to ask would be yeah a few people were allowed to resign a few people might have been charged how many were convicted Jimmy how you tell me how many were convicted no not a one so now why is that because the system comes together the system comes together to defend those who are corrupt if if they can because the fact that they are corrupt they've probably got information on other people too so there's a fear throughout throughout these two balls and I'll call them footballs and they operate in the operating in law they operated in policing maybe even in journalism I don't know but these two balls provide an instant strong defense they will go after whistleblowers they will go after any threat to one of their members because one member who cracks threatens the whole group right okay so so not only were they not convicted but they went after you right so you you were convicted for contempt of court in a civil lawsuit and you know and so there were secret recordings you made of your telephone conversations with the lawyers involved and I read the official court records showing what those lawyers told the court they lied to the court and as a result you were convicted for contempt of court while you weren't even in the country and then they offered you a plea bargain but you chose to go to prison instead so first of all what was the phony charge that they convicted you on and why didn't you take a plea bargain sugar well to me first of all that situation that we're talking about now is decades after that the police corruption undercover work that I did okay time and it has nothing to do with it I had I had a company and my company launched a lawsuit against people who and corporations who owed me money in the little island nation of Barbados but some of them were in Canada I tried to get that lawsuit heard in Canada because the Barbados courts are just very corrupted and one of the people I was suing was the Chief Justice of Barbados you don't have much luck suing the Chief Justice of Barbados in his old court in any event in Canada court decided that Canada was not the place for my company's civil suit and that's all well and good and then we had costs hearings when I was out of the country at the time I was a traveling in Asia and these lawyers they went to the court and obtained an order that the judge back dated ten days for them and that order ordered me to produce documents two days before the order was signed now think about that so I didn't know about this I didn't know what was happening but the day before or that I was supposed to appear for questioning in Toronto I phoned the court to see how the case was going and found out I was to appear the next day in Toronto well I couldn't appear so I telephoned and I had a long conversation with the lawyers and during that time they asked me if I had received a certain court order this court order that had been back dated I said no I hadn't they didn't know I was overseas I said no I hadn't tonigh asked some 12 different times and then they hung up on me they refused to let me testify over the phone or answer any questions and they went to the judge immediately and told the judge that during the phone conversation I had confirmed to them that I had received the order they lied now one would think lucky for me I recorded that phone call and it showed me well saying I didn't get that order please send it to me I didn't get it but they went to the court and they lied and the court in a secret hearing that I knew nothing about convicted me of contempt of court and sentenced me to three months in prison all on the basis of these lies both written in an world oral testimony before the court by these lawyers so I came back to Canada and I thought I would bring the recordings and other evidence I have adepts irrefutable shows the word lied I was not guilty I was innocent but the court refused to hear the new evidence it excluded the evidence and it continued to find me guilty so away to jail I went I was offered a deal and the deal was if I would apologize to the court even though I was innocent if I would forget about the full the lawyers perjured themselves lied obstructed justice then the court wouldn't send me to jail I refused that I refused to be part of a cover-up and a lie now I'm a little different I'm a little different at this stage of life my children are all grown I don't have a I'm in business for myself so I don't have to be at a job every day so I can take the head but some people can't and I understand now why thousands tens of thousands of people plead guilty even when they're innocent because the system exports guilty pleas for all kinds of reasons and one of the reason is to protect the cabal's who are very powerful I found that out so what so Don what so what you're saying that you're pull you're in your career of investigating police officers for their criminality that has anything to do with this case so what you're saying is that some lawyer is that correct that's correct and so what happened was these lawyers so this civil case you have these lawyers got colluded with this judge to criminally deceive the the court right and say that you did something you didn't do and why would they do that why would the judge and those lawyers do that why wouldn't they just was it because they knew you were gonna beat them in court or what was it well who knows why criminals do criminal things okay do they do they get lazy now there was a lot at stake there was a lot at stake okay then you know there was a corrupt police officer the lawyers had actually hired a corrupt Ontario Provincial Police Detective Sergeant to work for them privately on the side they paid him on the side I even have those invoices that he gave to the law firm and they paid totally illegal against the Criminal Code against the police act against the Private Investigators law in Ontario but this police officer was hired by these corrupt lawyers and he worked on the case investigating me on police time for a civil matter for which he took a bribe oh so so you you go you do the time and now ever and so how long ago was that when did you get out of prison how long ago 2014 and so ever since then you've been trying to get these people to justice who did this to you right the judge those lawyers and on your side in this case or in your fight is former Canadian government cabinet minister and police commissioner various law school professors and expert forensic witnesses formerly with the Ontario centre of Forensic Sciences you even have a former American CIA computer expert testifying about illegal activities against you by staff and judges in the Federal Court of Canada so it almost sounds like it's some kind of crazy conspiracy theory but except you appear to have solid evidence on your side and some highly credible people who back your story so do you think you're gonna be able to get justice ever out of these people well we'll see Jamie the fact the matter is I've been saying that these people these lawyers gerald banking Lawrence silver Sebastien Kaczynski judge Jay Brian Shaughnessy and former Detective Sergeant former Detective Sergeant with the OPP I've been saying that these people are corrupt and I've said it for years they don't sue me they have had me banned from the newspapers and because some of the lawyers or as I understand it represent some the major newspaper organizations in Canada but they don't dare sue me and I just keep saying their names and that's what I'm doing I'm still in court I complained to the Canadian judicial council about justice Shaughnessy and that was tossed without an investigation without looking at any evidence so I asked for a judicial review and we're in the middle of that right nowAnd the last of it:

and this is where all these other people who have seen my story who have looked at the evidence these experts including the former commissioner of police and they're on my side the lawyers the judge and even the Attorney General of Canada are doing everything they can to stop this Wow well listen you you know you good luck on this I mean I hope you could bring these people to justice we're always here for anti-corruption fighters but you you say that this kind of corruption is rampant in the United States too is is that or is it am i putting words in your mouth no you're not I think this kind of crap from well for instance one of the things that the doctor dr. Eric Cole is my ex CIA guy that sounds a little more sinister than then he was the Commissioner for cybersecurity for President Obama that's a little better and he's on my side one of the things that we discovered for instance was that judges and were their staff of the Federal Court of Canada for over a year and a half we're doing secret investigations into me into my witnesses my lawyers and we know that because they had a fixed IP number that identified the Federal Court of Canada and they visited my website so we have dozens and dozens of visits and we've applied to find out which personnel we're doing this this secret investigation now I mean yeah you know you think so what's the problem with judges and their staff secretly collecting information online of our cases are the litigants of abused persons witnesses what what's the problem with that well that's easy you see secret investigations secret evidence considered in backrooms that goes right to the heart of the justice system and this happens both in Canada and the United States we know this from other cases and and newspaper articles and legal articles that the law societies throughout North America have commissioned they know this is happening and you see persons before the court they have a right to see the evidence against them they have a right to cross-examine the witnesses who present the evidence and by the way I'm the only person in Canada in awe of who's gone to jail who was refused the right to cross-examine the very witnesses the court relied upon to convict and sentence me the only person in Canada that that's ever happened to to my knowledge so you know when there are secret trials secret hearings secret evidence consideration by judges or by jury members that's wrong it's illegal and it undermines everything and it's rampant right now I mean all of us when we when we hear something when we want to know something more about somebody we just pick up her phone some we google but you can't do that if you're in court considering evidence it's just it's illegal and it destroys everything but that activity is rampant in the United States it's rampant in Canada in the courts and we've proven it now we have the solid evidence backed up by experts like dr. Cole and once again the system is fighting it tooth and nail what we've applied to get the information from the courts administrative service the people who administer the courts computers they've refused so we're going further we want to know which judges were secretly gathering evidence even during one of the court hearings I saw that the judge sort of my beware had his laptop open on the bench and he was just surfing around during the during the hearing and bought into my case and lo and behold at that same day same hour and same minute someone from the Federal Court of Canada was visiting my website and doing various Google searches so we want the courts to come clean we want the judge to complain what this activity stopped and they're doing anything and everything they can to prevent us from learning which judges were doing these secret investigations into me in my case well Donald best we wish you all the best in you know getting to the bottom of this and bringing getting justice in your case and exposing these corrupt lawyers and judges and you know if something like that happens it'll be amazing but you know right especially in this day and age it takes a long time for whistleblowers to get there they're do people don't like them in the moment and then it takes a while for it to for people to come around to the report of view but listen thanks for taking time with us there anything else you want to leave us with that we should know about well yes I do Jimmy my friends when I came down to LA and saw you guys live right right right we want to know when you're coming live to trial ah I think you could fill a couple of venues I can think of I think it would be brave we had the most wonderful evening it was such a great time we want to see you again okay I will all right Donald we're definitely gonna come up to Toronto and Vancouver II I don't know about Montreal cuz I don't speak French but yes we're definitely coming to Canada we love Canada and thanks for the invitation and it was great to see you in Los Angeles at the show Donald best he is a he is an anti-corruption fighter from Canada thanks for being our guest and good luck and please check back in with us thanks so much Jimmy thanks for having me on the show see you later okay thanks for watching please make sure you're subscribed even if you think you are you're probably not it only takes a second to check and then you have to ring that Bell so they send you a notification when we drop a new video otherwise they won't tell you when we drop new videos and if you like our show please help support it become a patron we give you hours of bonus material every week and we give a live stream we do a live stream every Saturday at 2:00 p.m. Pacific time when you could ask us questions and we answer them back thanks for your supportI've pasted the youtube transcript into the post about the Canadian whistleblower cop from 3 weeks ago here to get an idea of the work required to post the transcripts here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/jimmydore/comments/9q2lbt/episode\_with\_cop\_whistleblower\_lays\_out\_how\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/jimmydore/comments/9q2lbt/episode_with_cop_whistleblower_lays_out_how_a/)Below is a portion of what's copy/pasted from the youtube transcript, to get an idea of what needs to be done. I've pasted the entire transcipt from youtube into the post about the Canadian cop whistleblower, who was on the show 3 weeks ago, to get an idea. I posted that one recently so it will be in the new articles. Here's some of it:

&gt;00:00 hi everybody welcome to jimmy dore show 00:01 we have special guest donald best is 00:03 with us he is considered one of canada's 00:06 most methodical and well-documented 00:08 whistleblowers he was a police sergeant 00:10 for over 30 years before becoming a 00:12 journalist filmmaker and an 00:14 anti-corruption advocate he spent 63 00:17 days in solitary confinement for 00:19 exposing corruption and he's here today 00:21 to tell us why please welcome to the 00:22 show donald best hey doll how are you 00:25 great Jimmy alright we like we like 00:31 whistleblowers and people who are 00:33 fighting corruption so before we get 00:36 into your work you know I want to know 00:37 what you're a police officer who was 00:40 assigned to investigate and arrest 00:42 corrupt police officers now that's so 00:45 much my career yes I can't think of a 00:47 more dangerous job than that you 00:50 deliberately hunted down and arrested 00:52 your fellow police officers first of all 00:54 why did you accept such an assignment 00:56 and how badly you were you ostracized 00:59 after your role became known by other 01:01 police officers well Jimmy you have to 01:04 understand that that organizations like 01:08 the police and the judiciary and lawyers 01:12 and so many powerful professions if they 01:15 don't place themselves well but 01:18 basically all goes to hell 01:19 it gets rotten it gets corrupt very very 01:22 very soon and I found myself earlier in 01:26 my place career finding that's I've seen 01:30 things everybody sees things and the 01:34 pressures on do not say anything and if 01:36 it's a small thing and you're new you 01:39 have to let it go up I'm sure it's that 01:41 way in journalism I'm sure it's that way 01:43 in medicine it's not with a lot of 01:44 professions but then you see more and 01:49 more and you have to make a decision 01:53 some people decide to ignore it some 01:57 people decide to be willfully blind but 02:01 when you do that you are empowering the 02:04 corruption but responsible for it 02:07 somebody has to have the courage 02:12 to do something but everybody's got 02:13 integrity but integrity is a little good 02:17 without courage so there were a few of 02:20 us and they put us into a corrupt squad 02:23 a squad where there were rumors about 02:27 organized crime about these same squad 02:30 members hanging around with socializing 02:35 with receiving money women all in 02:39 exchange for looking the other way while 02:42 organized crime did what it does so we 02:45 were infiltrated into that squad three 02:49 friends that I asked by the chief to go 02:52 in 02:52 nobody was told not even Internal 02:55 Affairs we worked there for a year we 02:57 pretended to be corrupt we took the 03:01 money we took the parties we had to 03:06 bring our own and women undercover 03:08 police officers we couldn't take the 03:09 women but some of the squad members who 03:14 weren't working with us they took all of

&amp;#x200B;Jimmy is the best! You're right that it would be good to build a bigger/stronger community of his fans. Maybe people could ask him about this sub on one of the Saturday live shows, or maybe message Ron @RonPlacone or Stef @miserablelib about it on twitter?

Since you're new-ish to Jimmy, here are some of his greatest hits:

We need to show people on Reddit why they should spend time here. Some ideas:

* have a discussion about what the most dangerous thing discussed on the recent episode was. This is necessary because act like alternative media is a joke, so it's always fun to get people freaked out about being part of a public discussion that's actually challenging the status quo.
* Type/paste your favorite quotes from the episode, and why you liked it. A problem with video/audio interviews is that it's difficult to quote them. Simply putting quotes in can go a long way. And show why it's worth peoples' time to be discussing it. People have to learn from them, which is what makes them useful.
* Show what's being talked about on the Jimmy Dore Show that isn't being talked about anywhere else, and maybe also opine on why others aren't talking about it.
* List predictions made on the show, along with their outcomes. For those still waiting to come true, post those predictions as they come in. Maybe have "prediction" in the title of the post. This generates interest because it holds someone accountable for taking a particular stance, rather than using gobbldygook which can't be challenged.&gt;President Obama did by coming to Flint

Please show me where I ever mentioned FlintNice job. This may come in handy. There’s a lot of brilliant comedy and great points made on the show. It could be useful having them in text.I love Bill Maher but jimmy should kick his ass and steal his show. Could you imagine how great of a show jimmy would make if he had the resources of HBO. If I were an oligarch I would give him that... And I’d give dj dougpound several million to make a movie. But that’s just me.have you ever heard of /r/chapotraphouse ? (okay, they don't necessarily know they're like minded, but it's a good crew and conversation. If we want to make a thriving community here, I think they're the ones we should be more mindful of)I didn't ignore anything, you said that I am ignoring "everything about the Obama administration to blame Republicans for everything," and proceeded to talk about Flint. Please show me where I made any commentary about Obama and Flint? Hint: I didn't. I have repeatedly said that Dems aren't near perfect, but that Republicans are far fucking worse. After this weekend, you can now add to the list of things that Trump is doing/trying to do that Clinton wouldn't have done: Roll back LGBT rights and remove transgenderism from rights laws and regs.&gt;Oh, and Clinton was the last one on board for LGBT rights along with Obama.

But she IS on board now, and the GOP isn't. How is this so fucking hard for you to just admit that the GOP is currently trying to roll back civil rights in a way that the Dems aren't? You are the one who is ignoring reality so that you don't have to admit that Trump in the WH and the GOP controlling Congress is obviously worse than Clinton in the WH and the Dems controlling Congress. I absolutely don’t want conservative policies and I cast every vote with the intention of limiting the number of conservative policies enacted. You, on the other hand, are completely fine with casting votes that will lead to the GOP creating far worse policies than the Dems because you think that all of the many more lives ruined by the GOP over the Dems are a sacrifice that you are willing to make.Nope, I have repeatedly made it clear that I don't agree with the Dems on economic policy. I am just willing to sacrifice a bit of what is in my wallet if it comes down to centrist Dem vs nut job GOP while fighting for more progressive Dem candidates in primaries in order to ensure that the GOP can't completely fuck up the environment, civil rights, etc.I would rather have non-ideal economic policies and avoid the attacks on civil rights and healthcare while we fight for progressive Dems. You are fine with having shit economic policies AND the attacks on civil rights and healthcare while trying to get a 3rd party candidate to even reach 5% of the vote. I find that stance to be utterly despicable. I will not sacrifice the civil rights of my fellow Americans so that I can say that I didn't vote for a centrist.rexactly u/cryptonews291TV is for boomers. Jimmy Dore can't be cancelled and doesn't have any pressure from sponsors. He can say whatever's on his mind with no consequences. The internet really did liberate the press, when it needed it most after all of the news outlets consolidated into an oligarchy.

So he has an unfair advantage on traditional broadcasters. Except the pay. Pretty sure he'd still get a 10th of Maddow's pay if he surpassed the same numbers.The black cube?Decades of "they are entitled to their opinion" or "can't we just agree that both sides have problems" and refusing to address the elephant in the room in our daily lives has allowed the so-called "alt-right" (read: neo-nazis) to reach the point where society seems to be treating them as "just another opinion." No, fuck that, the Dems aren't perfect, the Greens aren't perfect, but the scum that exists on the right needs to be named, shamed, and shunned. They are trash and will 100% continue to be trash until their friends and family (ie people they respect and care about) point it out. "It won’t get you anywhere except more push back." Will you get pushback? Of course, Conservatives are generally garbage people to start with, but there will be some people who don't fully grasp what it is they are doing/supporting, and every voter swayed from the right is one less vote that we have to overcome.&gt; "I would have voted for trump because he CAMPAIGNED as a non-interventionist.""Neo nazis and alt right is a very small subsect of people who voted for trump like Black Panther radicals were a small subsect who voted for Obama."

Trump was an open racist from the very beginning. Even more so than your average Republican. Here is a gem from early in the campaign in case you forgot: "They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” Let's not forget "birtherism." And then there is this gem of a tweet from 2013 "Sadly, the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanics-a tough subject-must be discussed." 
There was never any doubt that the GOP 2016 campaign was 100% racist. You say that you are fine voting for those racists and that is your choice (which I vehemently disagree with obviously), but you can't pretend that it wasn't an obviously racist campaign and platform from the start.Seder wasn’t on that panel thoughYeah, he lead the “should we be socialists” (or something) panel.&gt;"Sorry but that’s not being a racist."

Saying that the first black President is really a Kenyan muslim, selectively disenfranchising minorities, saying that immigrants are all criminals and constantly depicting black people and hispanics as predisposed to being criminals isn't racist? Are you for real?Alright, enjoy living with your head buried firmly in the "both sides are the same" sandWhy is it so hard for you to admit that Republicans are trying to roll back civil rights and environmental protections on a level that would be unheard of in the Democratic Party?&gt; I think they're trying to do exactly what you suggest by adopting a complex and nuanced position on foreign policy.

But that doesn't fit with their behavior at all: it's not *"nuanced"* to drop a progressive candidate entirely just because of one foreign policy point. If you really have a complex position then you don't crudely blacklist anyone who is the same side of the political spectrum.

And obviously there is no complexity whatsoever involved in accusing Jimmy Dore of "islamophobia". That charge is more than just simplistic and propagandistic, it's also a flat out lie.God that's an awful panel. Such group think and absence of alternative thought.&gt; Was he on the socialist one?

If he was then I surmise that he did nothing other than make us socialists look bad.That's such a boneheaded, daft liberal analysis. How are you going to rescue Republican voters (especially working class voters) from that party and its ideologies, if you've already written those human beings off in advance as "racists" and monsters? 

What's the plan then? Engineer a black hole, dump them all into it somehow?

They're just humans, and as political subjects, we are all constantly being reshaped in various ways. This requires long and hard work - and the billionaires who control most of politics have been taking shortcuts with the use of their vast resources - but we can do it too, one person at a time.

&gt; Shame your family and friends. Don't let them pretend that they are "still good people

I can assure you that you'll never convince anyone by condescendingly moralizing and acting all morally superior at them. That's not how politics works, you'll only hurt your side of the argument, in short it's counterproductive.

&gt;They just won't do it.

There's a reason they won't do it.  They don't want to and they certainly don't want to be put on the spot for not trying and face transparent responsibility for not trying when they can blame Republicans for their own actions and inactions instead.Why? That's easy. Because Democrats tend to go along with every rollback of civil and human rights, whenever they think they can get away with it. It was Obama who suspended Habeas Corpus and made the shadow security state permanent, not Bush. It was Obama who vastly expanded the NSA surveillance program beyond the modest beginnings that Bush had made with it. It was Obama who expanded the ICE repatriation apparatus that Trump is now deploying.

You can't trust a party that obediently follows the Rightwing down every single dark hole they choose to dive into.Ralph Nader explained why just [2 days ago the Larry King's PoliticKing show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5XbvZUgLLo). Nader said an AFL-CIO guy explained that Democrats "don't want to win" because it means the stances they'd have to take while in office would angry the wealthy donors so much that they wouldn't be funded in the next election. 

So I guess that means it's actually more profitable for the Democrat candidates to lose the election? This kind of thing needs to be explained in more detail. I can understand how the infamous "revolving door" in D.C. keeps the elections losers in power in D.C., but is that the only way the "loser" gets rewarded and kept in the establishment's grip?When people are participating in evil, the necessary and proper thing to do is to let them know that they're participating in evil. When I see a comment such as yours right here, I recognize it as part of a repeating pattern. It goes something like this:

1) The political right, regardless of how racist and hateful it is, is to be respected and pampered whereas:

2) Anyone from the left who tries to call them out for the evils they participate in, is told to stop being so hard on those participating in evil. And:

3) The person telling the left to stop being so mean to the right, is actually being very mean to the left. Which means:

4) It's acceptable in U.S. society to treat the left like garbage, even though the left is acting for the greater good, while we're all supposed to pamper and support the right, even though the right is acting for evil.

And here's your contradictory arguments I'm referring to:

&gt;I can assure you that you'll never convince anyone by condescendingly moralizing and acting all morally superior at them. That's not how politics works, you'll only hurt your side of the argument

and

&gt;That's such a boneheaded, daft liberal analysisOn the one hand, you said in a comment above that:

&gt;I am a sanders supporter who voted for Stein in the general.

While on the other hand in this comment you said:

&gt;Hillary Clinton called black youth super predators but she’s never called a racist.

Well, here's your very own [Bernie Sanders saying that Hillary's use of the term "super predator" is "racist"](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bernie-sanders-slams-clintons-racist-1996-super-predators-comment/).

It's pretty ridiculous when people try to act like there isn't racism in the United States. Stop trying to bury it, it's all over our history and has not gone away, and won't go away any time soon. As long as there are unfair distributions of wealth and incarcerations among the different races, it will continue to be statistically verifiable that there's racism in U.S. politics. And yes, it exists within both parties. Even the supposed angel FDR screwed over black people in the economic recovery programs in order to appeal to the racist southern white voters, so that they wouldn't vote Republican. The southern whites would have been angry if the black people received aid during the Great Depression, so FDR obeyed their commands and abandoned black people during The Great Depression so that Democrats could continue to dominate the U.S. government (or at least that was their excuse).When I see a statement like:

&gt;This is not racism but tribalism.

I can't help but laugh. So gee, thanks Copernicus for the paradigm shift. We all (ie - entire population of U.S.) should have known that this was never racism in the U.S., but should have seen things through the eyes of /u/E46_M3, who is the only one who had the vision to recognize that it's actually been "tribalism" this whole time. Time to rewrite all the history books...I completely agree with this part:

&gt;the scum that exists on the right needs to be named, shamed, and shunned. They are trash and will 100% continue to be trash until their friends and family (ie people they respect and care about) point it out.You said:

 &gt; it’s not that these people truly dislike people of color

But there's a very long history of evidence that white people truly dislike people of color. [Take Thomas Jefferson, for example, who said](https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/12/opinion/jefferson-is-america-and-america-is-jefferson.html) about ethnic Africans:

&gt;"They secrete less by the kidneys, and more by the glands of the skin, which gives them a very strong and disagreeable odor," he argues, adding that this "renders them more tolerant of heat, and less so of cold than the whites."

To claim that someone's sweat smells like urine is clearly an expression of "dislike" for someone. 

Oh yeah, and then there's [that long history of these happy little events, mostly in the South, called "lynchings"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching_in_the_United_States). **I think it's safe to argue that one group of people having a tendency to lynch those of another group is clearly an expression of "dislike".** Unless you're going to actually try to refute that here?When you say:

&gt;White people dont dislike Mexicans because of the color of their skin but because they have been fed lies about Mexicans taking their jobs.

You're assuming for some strange reason that the "dislike" of Mexicans is some kind of new phenomenon, which is related to the current jobs situation. You're forgetting about this little event in U.S. history known as "[The Alamo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Alamo)". There was actually a war between the U.S. and Mexico. 

And then there's the fact that Mexicans are Spanish-speaking, and there were whites in the U.S. who thought that people of Spanish descent were inferior to those of English descent. And then there's those in Mexico who are from indigenous groups (what we in the U.S. call "Native Americans"), who make up a very large part of the Mexican population. There are quotes from U.S. government officials saying to not associate too closely with the Native peoples of Mexico because they are ethnically inferior.

Some history of the hatred and racism against Mexican people is [mentioned on the History Channel's website](https://www.history.com/news/the-brutal-history-of-anti-latino-discrimination-in-america), which mentions that, "School segregation, lynchings and mass deportations of Spanish-speaking U.S. citizens are just some of the injustices Latinos have faced."

Sounds like racism to me.First of all, you first say that whites are hating black people because they've been "preconditioned and brainwashed", and then you contradict that by saying the whites' hatred for black people is because of "tribalism", which is "an evolutionary trait". 

When you say

&gt;If you mingled with another tribe they could give you a disease that wipes out your whole tribe

You have to completely ignore the long history of trade among different human groups. Speaking of Native Americans and "mingling", you ought to know that they had [extensive trade routes throughout the Americas](http://mapmanusa.com/cci-print-3.html). The natives even traded with the Europeans colonists, since trade was so deeply ingrained into the native peoples' history that it was normal to exchange goods with different peoples. And as it turns out, [these European colonists deliberately infected blankets with smallpox](https://academic.udayton.edu/health/syllabi/Bioterrorism/00intro02.htm) with the intended effect of causing genocide on the natives, since the Europeans discovered that smallpox was devastating to the natives for some unknown reason. 

So it wasn't "mingling" with another tribe that spread the disease, since humans can help each other when it comes to stopping infectious diseases, and have a history of this, but it was the pre-meditated mass-murder by ethnic Europeans against the natives. 

And when it comes to evolutionary traits, you should know that humans, and all animal species for that matter, have a long history of being liberal about who/what they have sex with. This is [evidenced by a recent discovery in an cave in Africa](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/new-fossil-discovery-change-what-know-human-evolution-homo-naledi-180956559/) which shows that early humans had traits consistent with human-like creatures having sex with more ape-like creatures, due to strange mixes of features, which implies that a species separates into 2 branches, which then re-combine in the future. So the evolutionary tree is no longer a tree, but more like water flows in a delta, which split and re-combine. This is also evidenced by the fact that [ethnic European humans have Neanderthal D.N.A.](https://www.livescience.com/42933-humans-carry-20-percent-neanderthal-genes.html), which could have only gotten there by having sex with Neanderthals.

And then there's the fact that we're talking about Mexico here, and they're the ones who use the word "mestizo" to describe themselves, which [literally translates as "mixed", as in, "mixed race"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mestizo). Two very different tribes obviously combined, and that's the population of Mexico today.

This mixing of different ethnicities occurred so much in Central and South America that [Hitler noticed it and talked about it in Mein Kampf](http://hitler.org/writings/Mein_Kampf/mkv1ch11.html). He praised the whites of Canada and United States, who were prominently Protestant, for refusing to mix with black people and the natives while admonishing whites of Central and South America, who were predominantly Catholic, for mixing with blacks and natives. Hitler wrote:

&gt;No more than Nature desires the mating of weaker with stronger individuals, even less does she desire the blending of a higher with a lower race, since, if she did, her whole work of higher breeding, over perhaps hundreds of thousands of years, night be ruined with one blow.
Historical experience offers countless proofs of this. It shows with terrifying clarity that in every mingling of Aryan blood with that of lower peoples the result was the end of the cultured people. North America, whose population consists in by far the largest part of Germanic elements who mixed but little with the lower colored peoples, shows a different humanity and culture from Central and South America, where the predominantly Latin immigrants often mixed with the aborigines on a large scale. By this one example, we can clearly and distinctly recognize the effect of racial mixture. The Germanic inhabitant of the American continent, who has remained racially pure and unmixed, rose to be master of the continent; he will remain the master as long as he does not fall a victim to defilement of the blood.

So your argument about humans having evolutionarily evolved to have completely segregated tribes which are constantly committing genocide on each other for "money" is false. There are numerous groups of peoples and cultures all throughout history who have mingled and traded, and not become so hateful and racist towards each other that they lynched each other as has occurred in the United States. The way black people and natives have been treated by whites in the U.S. is significantly different from how, for example, ethnic Chinese have interacted with ethnic Thais for the past 2,000 years. The same goes with Chinese trade with the Persians. The situation in the United States is exceptional, it's not the rule. There is racism here, and it's a huge problem.&gt;my argument is that these broad comments are not truly out of hatred like it’s being painted but rather out of tribalism or others

All that one has to do is poll those who watch the news and ask them what they think of the group being demonized by the media. 9 out of 10 times those people are going to express hatred for the group being demonized. You can try to whitewash it all day long, but when people answer in polls that they want to "attack" or "retaliate" against the group that the people in power are telling us is attacking us, to me, those overtly militant words sound like hate. There's a long history of discrimination and hatred in the U.S. against those our leaders tell us to hate. You can start with the [anti-German sentiment in the U.S. during World War 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-German_sentiment#United_States). Then you can move on to the [anti-Japanese sentiment in the U.S. during World War 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Japanese_sentiment_in_the_United_States), or read about [deliberately racist propaganda in World War 2](https://artifactsjournal.missouri.edu/2012/03/wwii-propaganda-the-influence-of-racism/). The ordinary folks throughout the U.S. clearly had a "true hatred" of Japanese and Germans at this time, and how they were treated in their day-to-day lives reflects that. There are countless testimony of the racism, violence, and hatred against them.

I suppose you're going to now argue that people engaged in combat aren't really feeling rage while firing at the enemy, and are instead disobeying orders from their superior officers who command them to get angry and kill kill kill? People literally shooting at and stabbing each other with bayonets is not "truly out of hatred"? &gt;those people with a true hatred are a small, ignorant minority

So then why did Ronald Reagan's top political strategist, Lee Atwater, [deliberately appeal to hatred and racism against black people to get Reagan elected President in 1980](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Atwater#"Southern_strategy"). As Atwater stated in an interview in 1981:

&gt;Questioner: But the fact is, isn't it, that Reagan does **get to the Wallace voter and to the racist side of the Wallace voter by doing away with legal services, by cutting down on food stamps**?

&gt;Atwater: Y'all don't quote me on this. **You start out in 1954 by saying, "Nigger, nigger, nigger". By 1968 you can't say "nigger"—that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights and all that stuff**. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and **a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it**. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that **if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other**. You follow me—because obviously sitting around saying, "We want to cut this", is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than "Nigger, nigger".

And why did this man, well-known for using dirty tricks, rise to become Chair of the Republican National Committee in 1989? Notice that the Republican Party, to this day, still says things like "we want to cut this", because it appeals to racism and hatred of black people. So this claim by you about a "small, ignorant minority" of true haters, which you imply is so small that it doesn't matter, is just plain false. The Republican Party goes out of its way to appeal to them. Not only that, but the Clintons did in the 90's, with Hillary claiming that black teenage boys are "super predators", and Bill advocating what he called "welfare reform".

You said, reasons tribes are against each other:
&gt; One was disease and others were competition.

Since whites have been around black people for so long, we know that disease hasn't been the problem for at least 400 years. I guess it comes down the perceived competition whites have with black people. The fact that black people in the U.S. make up 12% of the population, and are the most impoverished demographic (aside from some native tribes on reservations), means that black people aren't much competition to the white majority. So what's left now?

Then you said:
&gt;Politicians use derision and attacking outsiders as bad guys

This is wrong, since anyone who follows the Jimmy Dore Show should know that it's the wealthy donors who tell politicians what to do. Politicians just read from the script that's handed to them.

You said:
&gt;the media plays up this fear tactic that minorities will come take what’s yours and your land whatever

Again, the talking heads in the media just read from the teleprompter that's in front of them, as well as that voice in their earpiece making adjustments for what to say in real time. The business owners of that media organization are the ones writing up what to say. Anyone who follows the Jimmy Dore Show ought to know this already.

So the question now is, why are the wealthy business owners pushing all this fear of "others" in the media and through the mouths of our local politicians?This whole discussion started because you said:

&gt;These racist remarks only help to further divide the tribes by attempting to shame the “other” guys. It won’t get you anywhere except more push back.

And in another comment you said:

&gt;at the time I would have voted for trump because he CAMPAIGNED as a non-interventionist...people got bamboozled and we’re left with only 2 options so you can’t just dismiss them as racists

These Trump voters can simply make statements opposing racism. They can also agree that when the Republican Party blocks black people and Native Americans from voting, that's racism. The Trump voters can tell me that they agree with me about the history of racism in the Republican Party, and that I am correct to admonish Trump for making the racist statements that he did. At that point, we have unity and can focus on going after the wealthy elites who manipulate the majority in order to stay wealthy. 

...As Donald Trump has done. 

So I take it we're now in agreement that:

1) it's the wealthy people who are causing the main problems in the U.S.

2) these wealthy people are manipulative, and use the media to spread racist statements that are meant to divide the people against each other

3) when these wealthy people get elected into office, they get involved in swampy politics where they're making business deals for themselves and their buddies

4) Donald Trump completely fits the profile of a typical wealthy elite who does all 3 of the above.&gt; Everything to you is racism and that’s where you’re wrong.

Not true. I only call racism where racism is confirmed.

As for the purge in Brooklyn, I don't know what the demographic makeup of that neighborhood was. If it's mostly black people, of course there's reasonable suspicion of racism on the part of Democrats. I've already mentioned that the Clintons in the 90's calling black teenage boys "super predators" is racist, and I linked an article quoting Bernie Sanders as saying it's racist. The Democrats also have their own history of racism. Just ask black people in primarily Democrat regions, especially in big cities. Democrat-run police departments in big cities such as New York and Chicago are notoriously obnoxious and violent towards black people. Same goes for the justice systems in those regions. 

And of course rich people are going to make sure that the Democrats don't end racism, since it means redistribution of wealth away from wealthy whites and towards poor black people. The fact that wealthy whites have rigged the system to prevent socialist economic policies shows that the wealthy whites have zero respect for black people in the U.S. Add that to the fact that Democrats have been horrible when it comes to showing support for public housing projects, which would include listening to what the recipients of welfare would like be done to improve the system, shows that Democrats are also racist.

If you don't want to believe me, simply ask black people in black neighborhoods what they think is racist or not. I'm sure a whole lot of them happen to have this strange belief that Donald Trump voters are racists. I'm sure that if the neighborhood in Brooklyn that was purged is mostly black, the black people there would say it was due to racist Democrats making sure only Hillary gets the nomination, since Sanders' socialist policies would help black people.

It'd be interesting for me to see someone on a YouTube video in a black neighborhood in Chicago, New York, and Las Angeles and try explaining to black people that for the past 500 years, what black people have been experiencing in the U.S. wasn't "racism", but "opportunism" or "tribalism". This is an original idea that I haven't heard before, and maybe all that black people have needed all this time is for the one person to rise up and explain this to them, so all these black people can be liberated of this supposed delusion of racism that they've falsely believed in this whole time. What you're suggesting really does imply a major paradigm shift in the understanding of U.S. history and race relations.In the case of major wars, it can be a little more understandable that they've been brainwashed to attack another ethnic group. So then sure, there's a good argument that insulting those who are engaged in a firefight by calling them racists in the middle of a battle, isn't going to win their votes.

But in the case of Republican voters in the U.S., they're not in a fast-paced ongoing war in which each side is trying to destroy the infrastructure of the other. Instead, Republican voters have access to all kinds of educational resources, including libraries, universities, and a massive communications infrastructure. And the primaries for the last election started in early 2015. These Republican voters had a little over a year-and-a-half up to the November 2016 elections in order to research the situation and come up with the best solution.

During that time, Trump openly said many racist things as well as encouraged his supporters to violently assault protesters at his rallies. The Trump supporters didn't stop the racism. Instead, they reveled in it. The Trump campaign even embraced the slogans "All Lives Matter" and "Blue Lives Matter" rather than "Black Lives Matter". This was obviously to appeal to racist whites. It's a simple thing for white people, and the Republican Party, to simply say, "I agree, black lives do matter, and we whites need to do better to fix the situation". But the Republican Party didn't do that. They defied black people with the alternative slogans. And with all of the police violence incidents, the Republicans keep on supporting the violent police, regardless of the evidence against the cop's claims. The Republicans have absolutely refused to crack down on police corruption and police violence, instead pretending that all cops have too much youthful innocence to do any wrong.

After Trump was elected, children in schools were experiencing more racism and violent attacks then ever before, due to some kids thinking Trump's election was carte blanche for white kids to attack ethnic minorities.

The Republican Party did nothing to stop this. Fox News did nothing to stop this. And then there was the violence in Charlettesville, and Trump was playing it off like both sides were equally guilty. There were fascists with swastikas, advocating the extermination of people, and the Republican Party couldn't condemn them.

And now here we are in 2018. With all of these obvious appeals to racism, and all of these minorities who clearly feel threatened, and all of these Mexican families being split up in concentration camps, and all this money about to spent on a border wall, and all these fascists going around attacking people in the streets, and the Republican Party still refusing to say that the "Black Lives Matter" movement is a good movement, you're actually going to argue that the people who continue to follow Republican media, and who continue to support openly racist Republican candidates, are people we should be pampering and desperately pleading with for support?

Hell no! The Republican voters have too much leisure time and freedom in their daily lives to have not figured out by now the absolute evil that is the Republican Party. There's no excuse for them being ignorant of what the Republican Party stands for and who runs it. At some point, we have to follow the Republican Party's own mantra of "personal responsibility", and apply that to those who continue to support the Republicans and these obviously evil policies they stand for and the rhetoric they use. And this isn't even getting into the catastrophic environmental failures of the Republican Party, the most notable being ExxonMobile burying climate science data in the 1970's, which shows that even with early access to information, the Republicans will still fail to act properly on it.

I agree with Noam Chomsky when he said that the Republican Party is "the most dangerous organization in human history". See:

[Chomsky on the GOP: Has Any Organization Ever Been So Committed to Destruction of Life on Earth?](https://www.democracynow.org/2017/4/26/chomsky_on_the_gop_has_any)I agree with Nader.

There's no proper penalty for sociopathic politicians and pundits who turn their backs on average Americans in support of corporatist agendas that favor a wealthy donor class and no one else.

I mean, sure, they'll be hated publicly by a segment of Americans that keep themselves informed, but otherwise they'll live in the lap of luxury the rest of their lives insulated and separated from the "riff-raff" in gated communities and/or mansions surrounded by their wealthy peers who could also give zero fucks about average Americans.

There's definitely nuance where some of them actually care about their public perception and want to be loved, but they have a crafty public relations industry to turn to.  For example, the PR industry will have them give a pittance of their plunder towards philanthropy along with other tactics in attempts to sway public opinion and manufacture consent.

Hell, if the PR industry can resurrect GW Bush's image among soft-headed liberals in recent years, they can pull off just about anything.

They've got quite the game going, but I do have a plan to smash that shell game in 4-8 years here:

edit: grammar/spellingAnd no one gives a fuck. Just like trump, kavanaugh, ect. The media has actually REAL issues that they can demonize someone with, but they dont. I think its because their donors dont want them to because their donors are the republican donors. Its like Coke and Pepsi, no big difference between the two, but people with cavities will yell that the other is retarded.That was greatI meant more 'make us look bad by pushing centrist voting' (which he also does).

In any case: panel on socialism without any self-described socialists = MASSIVE FAIL (as you suggest)pied pipe-her strategyYes on social issues they are different, but when it comes to finance, the wars, fucking over the middle class, they are the same.
Jimmy Dore doesn't get it. There will always be a voting of "lesser evils" in modern times until the multi-billion dollar corporate media machine is addressed.  Just look at how many viewers and subscribers Jimmy has compared to corporate media.  His viewership and influence is just a tiny drop in the mass media bucket.

Jimmy loves Noam Chomsky, but he needs to re-read 'Manufacturing Consent' to better understand the dynamic progressives are up against versus a vast, highly effective propaganda machine with a national reach and influence only billions of dollars can attain.

Corrupt corporations utilize powerful, expensive mass communications to maintain a hostile environment for progressives. In contrast, they garner this massive reach to maintain a fertile ground for corporate Democrats and Republicans to thrive and do their bidding.

Their power all hinges on perpetuating a big lie.

The big lie they are actively promoting is the illusion that corporate Democrats would fight for average Americans if only Republicans would stop hindering them.  The truth that tens of millions of Democratic-leaning and independent voters still don't know is that the corrupt Democrats very much collude with Republicans to perpetuate a system that works against them.

Within this environment both organizations can do the bidding of the wealthy donor class while the public is indoctrinated to believe there are two warring parties stuck in gridlock when it comes to creating beneficial policies.  The big lie is neither party has any such intentions and collude with each other to keep it that way.

Attempting to expose this big lie and compete for national reach against the massive infrastructure of a multi-billion dollar media machine that's been entrenched nationwide for decades is possible with grassroots small donations — but it'll take decades of slow growth at best.  That's time the people and planet don't have.

My plan is primarily about outmatching this widespread national reach and influence of multi-billion dollar corporate media machines that successfully indoctrinate tens of millions of Americans against their own best interests.  This strategy creates a habitable atmosphere nationwide for progressive third party growth alongside a hostile takeover of the Democratic party from within by progressives who refuse to accept corporate donations and support policies that benefit average Americans.

This graphic below shows the political dynamic that the corporatists damn well do not want progressives to understand, nor exploit: 

https://i.imgur.com/lcYPn9W.png

As clearly shown within the graphic above, corporate Democrats thrive on a cycle of public discontent with the Republicans.  In turn, progressives and progressive movements thrive on public discontent with the corporate Democrats.

That's exactly why in recent years the corporate Democrats have been literally losing on purpose to "maintain the balance" between the power of the two parties.  The corporate Democrats do NOT want to be put into a position of transparent responsibility.  They desperately need for the Republicans to be maintained as a scapegoat for their own actions and inaction or their shell game will be exposed nationwide.

We can continue to spin our wheels for decades attempting to combat the multi-billion dollar influence of the corporate media — or with my strategy we can expose corporate Democrats to tens of millions of Americans who will see for themselves within 4-8 years what even a nationwide media machine cannot hide.

Indoctrinated people are a very tough nut to crack on an individual basis, much less en masse.

The fastest, best way for progressives with very limited money and resources to be able to reach tens of millions of indoctrinated voters and circumvent their egos is by inducing an environment that allows these voters to see how things are for themselves.

This terrifies the establishment and the consistent, recent track record of corporate Democrats very purposefully losing to Republicans on purpose — proves it.

Like tranny bathrooms?&gt;Jimmy has openly called the US an oligarchy

Agreed.

edit: On a side note, I find it interesting how hardcore Jimmy Dore fans are often the only people who can't comprehend the plan or at least pretend not to.  I'm a fan of Jimmy Dore, but I don't agree with all of his strategies.  

His third party strategy is dead in the water and pissing in the wind until he addresses the multi-billion dollar corporate media complex that absolutely destroys his reach.  If you doubt this, go out on the streets and ask people who Jimmy Dore is.  Go ahead and find out the **cold reality** that very few Americans know who he is — much less know his progressive messages and plans.

My plan acknowledges the reality of a multi-billion dollar corporate media machine.  [My plan understands this reality](https://i.imgur.com/lcYPn9W.png):

• Public dissent with Republican failure builds corporate Democrat power across the nation in modern times.  Hence, Obama after GW Bush and Kamala Harris after Trump.

• Public dissent with corporate Democrats builds progressive power across the nation in modern times.  Hence, Occupy Wall Street and Bernie Sanders rise after Obama &amp; Corporate Democrats failed to enact progressive agendas.

Jimmy ignores this dynamic and therefore he doesn't exploit it.  *My plan does.*  That is, if you bother to read and comprehend it, anyway.
