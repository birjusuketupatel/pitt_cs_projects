*"The Republican party is taking a nap somewhere"—[John Boehner](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/boehner-republican-party-taking-nap-somewhere?h_sid=c7f746b793-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), one Bloody Mary in*                      
              
**Pardon Me, I'm Terrible**
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
**President Trump deployed the pardon power corruptly for the third time, granting a reprieve to [Dinesh D'Souza](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/31/politics/trump-dinesh-dsouza-pardon/index.html?h_sid=c7f746b793-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** a racist, right-wing conspiracy theorist, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to making illegal campaign contributions. Trump also floated the possibility of further pardons for people who have been convicted of the kinds of crimes for which his associates are currently under investigation! Weird coincidence!                   
                 
**Earlier this year, Trump pardoned [Scooter Libby](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/us/politics/trump-pardon-scooter-libby.html?h_sid=c7f746b793-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)**—Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff—for obstruction of justice and perjury convictions. Last year he pardoned [Joe Arpaio](https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/25/politics/sheriff-joe-arpaio-donald-trump-pardon/index.html?h_sid=c7f746b793-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)—the racist and inhumane former Maricopa County, AZ sheriff—for criminal contempt of court.                        
                   
**The thread connecting these pardons (other than the fact they’re all politically connected Republicans)** is that they pertain to the same family of crimes that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating. Campaign violations. Abuse of power. Obstruction. The message to subjects of the Russia investigation is: Hang tight, don't squeal, perjure yourself if necessary, and a pardon will await you too. He can do it with a tweet if he wants! It’s a neat constitutional power.                                 
         
**Trump, after all, has every reason to be concerned that his associates will flip on him.** His indicted campaign manager, [Paul Manafort](https://www.axios.com/manafort-on-gates-plea-i-maintain-my-innocence--892bc806-b5f3-4353-a4ed-66e0af9d4c28.html?h_sid=c7f746b793-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), is proclaiming his innocence. His personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, is expected to be indicted soon, as is his political adviser [Roger Stone](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/20/17373864/roger-stone-indictment-mueller-wikileaks-russia?h_sid=c7f746b793-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84). Both men have professed their loyalty to Trump and promised not to turn on him—for now. The pardon dangle seems intended to persuade them not to.                                 
        
**It’s hard to overstate how serious an abuse of power this is, and why it's so important that Mueller is cooperating with state Attorneys General.** If Trump grants pardons to people like Manafort and Cohen, it still wouldn’t prevent them from being tried and convicted in state courts, which means they still have an incentive to cooperate with prosecutors.

In response, each has promised or implemented retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports.                  
             
**On Thursday night, Trump's longtime political adviser [Roger Stone](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-offers-pardon-to-conservative-pundit-dinesh-dsouza-for-campaign-finance-violations/2018/05/31/b4939a08-64d5-11e8-a768-ed043e33f1dc_story.html?h_sid=05a0eed59f-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.6c733646b7e1&amp;noredirect=on) gave away the game about Trump's use of the pardon power.** “It has to be a signal to Mike Flynn and Paul Manafort and even Robert S. Mueller III: Indict people for crimes that don’t pertain to Russian collusion and this is what could happen,” Stone said, acknowledging Trump is witness tampering. “The special counsel has awesome powers, as you know, but the president has even more awesome powers.” Real constitutionalist, this guy!        
               
**Then, on Friday morning, Trump teased highly sensitive, market-moving labor market data [before its official release](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-breaks-with-decades-of-protocol-with-tweet-before-release-of-jobs-report/2018/06/01/b89c0f26-65d0-11e8-a768-ed043e33f1dc_story.html),** breaking protocol that prevents the sharing of this information for the purposes of market manipulation and insider trading. This also raises concerns that Trump himself, or his family and political allies, [might be trading on that information month by month](https://crooked.com/article/corruption-basic-fact-trump-administration/?h_sid=05a0eed59f-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84). (But they would never! JK.)                      
              
**This is a reminder that the Republican Congress is just not doing the job of, you know, Congress.** Congressional Republicans say they hate Trump’s tariffs, but they aren’t using their power to reverse them. A few of them might say it’s inappropriate of Trump to prematurely tweet out sensitive economic information, but none have called for investigations even though this breach would have been a big scandal in any other administration. They can’t stop him from pardoning whoever he wants directly, short of impeachment, but they could speak out and use their oversight powers to discourage these abuses.

The humanitarian crisis they have faced has made them arguably the [most persecuted minority on the planet](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/31/asia/rohingya-resettlement-united-nations-intl/index.html?h_sid=05a0eed59f-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=66fa81fe4c-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_06_01_08_38&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=CNN+Five+Things&amp;utm_term=0_6da287d761-66fa81fe4c-86393421).

**One problem: this isn’t true. Obama did not “enlarge” the D.C. circuit court, or try to pack it in any way.** Oh no! A lie! Obama nominated judges to fill existing vacancies, per the job posting as described in Article II of the constitution. And it’s worth noting: Democrats did not change the filibuster rule in a vacuum; they did so after Republicans had imposed a blanket filibuster on all of those nominees, making clear that they would hold seats open for a Republican president to fill. There should probably be a correction, but the whole damn system needs a correction, you know?

[Kassie Solon on Twitter: "She glowed up so hard on us. Y'all said she isn't a planet and she went out and got a whole revenge bod, and now y'all keep saying you miss Pluto being a planet but you had your chance!! Look at her, she has Moved On!!"](https://twitter.com/kassaffrass/status/1002059274502131713)"I think that we have to internalize the idea that [income inequality] is a solvable problem, and not some inexorable force, some unstoppable natural result of change, or globalization, or automation, because the data simply doesn't support it, the facts don't support it, and I think too many Democrats have internalized it, too many Republicans have internalized the idea that it's not a problem to solve at all. You know, there are tangible answers to fix this problem today, that will give power and opportunity to working people and consumers, that will restore some dignity for people. 

Economic inequality is a consequence of selfish and destructive policy choices, and if we knock on enough doors, and throw out enough Republicans, and elect Democrats who are willing to *really fight*, not say they get it, not just act like it's important, not see it as an important message, but as an organizing principle that requires *making enemies*, that requires making enemies of donors, that makes enemies of certain corporations, that recognizes that you can't just go along to get along. That if we elect *those kinds* of Democrats we can actually solve this problem. And I do see glimmers of hope, that Democrats are starting to get this, not fast enough, not strong enough, but I do believe that change is happening. Because I really feel like there's only so far we can stretch the fabric of our society before it doesn't bounce back. ... 

So often we act as if these are forces outside of our control, but we have power in the system, and one of the ways in which we can assert our power is remembering we are not helpless, we are not the subjects of these corporations, we are not the subjects of our government, we choose our government, and we can choose a government that will actually solve this problem. You know, you see a glimmer of hope with someone like Larry Krasner, who comes in and says we can solve inequality in this city, and we can do it here, and in congress, and that's what we have to do."

**"I Am The Law!"**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**In Monday morning [tweets](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1003616210922147841), and a [January memo](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/02/us/politics/trump-lawyers-memo-mueller-subpoena.html?h_sid=370666e2a8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) from his then-lawyers to Special Counsel Robert Mueller,** President Trump made a series of pretty dangerous (and silly if it weren’t so serious) legal claims.                              
           
**First, Trump [claimed](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1003637916919320577) that the appointment of Mueller was unconstitutional** (though no one knows what the heck that means because [it’s bullshit](https://twitter.com/steve_vladeck/status/1003626713119711232).) And, in a pretty exciting development if you want to live under a monarch, Trump said that he has the “[absolute right](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1003616210922147841)” to pardon himself.                            
            
**The previously undisclosed January [letter from Trump's lawyers to Mueller](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/02/us/politics/trump-legal-documents.html?h_sid=370666e2a8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) makes similarly fantastic assertions of executive power,** including the sweeping claim that the president can "direct the Justice Department to open or close an investigation."                     
                   
**Taken together, these amount to a claim that the president is totally above the law,** and that his political enemies are only free from prosecution at his mercy. Luckily for us, Trump is a fair and righteous spirit who would never abuse powers his lawyers pulled out of their asses.                            
                 
**Trump is acting as if he expects Mueller's findings in the obstruction and collusion investigations** to be very bad news for him.                       
             
**The January letter concedes that [Trump dictated the dishonest statement](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/02/politics/trump-lawyers-statement-trump-tower-russians/index.html?h_sid=370666e2a8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) his son issued last year about his meeting in Trump Tower** with Russian agents offering dirt on Hillary Clinton. Previously his lawyers and the White House had claimed Trump had nothing or little to do with that statement. So they are admitting to a pretty big lie.                        
               
**Here’s a question: Why would they concede the lie, first privately to Mueller and then publicly?** Either the Trump squad discovered a new-found love of integrity via a visit from a ghost, or they know that the truth will come out anyhow. Could be either!                           
             
**Bottom line: Whatever Mueller has on the Crime Family-in-Chief, Trump’s legal strategy seems to be to place himself above the law** and dare Congress to respond. As always, we return to the fundamental problem of Trump-era politics: It’s not only Trump, but those in his party who refuse to stand up to him.                      
                           
**What Else**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt had an official aide do personal tasks for him, such as inquiring with [the Trump Hotel](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/pruitt-had-aide-do-numerous-personal-tasks-including-a-hunt-for-a-used-trump-hotel-mattress/2018/06/04/a1f72c84-6043-11e8-b2b8-08a538d9dbd6_story.html?h_sid=370666e2a8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.a30e895544da)** in DC about purchasing a used mattress like a totally normal person. (THIS IS SO WEIRD.) At this point, it would only be surprising if it came out that Pruitt once asked his aides to do ethical tasks that pertained to their job descriptions.                                    
                  
**The [Supreme Court sided](https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/supreme-court-baker-marriage-colorado-masterpiece-cake?h_sid=370666e2a8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.gslooaxjD#.er0yykj0g), on narrow technical grounds, with Masterpiece Cakeshop—**the Colorado bakery that refused to make a wedding cake for a same sex couple, avoiding, for now, a ruling on the question of whether certain businesses can cite their first amendment rights as a basis for discriminating against people protected by civil rights laws.                          
              
**Facebook [shared user data with over 60 companies](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/03/technology/facebook-device-partners-users-friends-data.html?h_sid=370666e2a8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) that make smartphones and tablets,** including Apple, Amazon, BlackBerry, Microsoft, and Samsung, raising privacy concerns and concerns that Facebook is violating its consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission in which it pledged not to allow companies to access the data of users’ friends without permission. Time for another Facebook apology tour? Feels like the last one just wrapped up.            
                        
**A [new study](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/03/health/breast-cancer-chemo.html?h_sid=370666e2a8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;nlid=6112595420180604&amp;te=1&amp;nl=morning-briefing&amp;emc=edit_nn_20180604) shows that about 70 percent of women who have early-stage breast cancer don’t need chemotherapy treatments they are generally prescribed.** According to the study, doctors can run genetic tests on tumors to determine which patients can safely skip chemotherapy and take estrogen-reducing medications instead.

- According to a [new CBS/YouGov poll](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dy4Nj1f7Z80NUkxfFax_nmyl6t3DegxF/view?h_sid=2e565cdec9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), of those who say GOP changes to the health care system under Trump have affected them personally, more than twice as many claim those changes have hurt them than helped them.

**From Brian:** Republicans want their voters to believe Democrats have a secret plan to impeach Trump if they win back the House. That is complete bullshit. On the other hand, there *is* a potential future House majority with a secret plan—it’s a GOP plan to throw millions and millions of people off the insurance rolls in 2019.                                 
         
**Ramping Up Tampering**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office caught former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort [attempting to tamper with witnesses](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/us/politics/paul-manafort-mueller-witness-tampering.html?h_sid=2e565cdec9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).** On Monday night Mueller filed a motion asking a federal judge to either rescind his supervised release and throw him in jail, or to revise the terms of his release. Manafort is acting both like a man who believes that cooperating with Mueller would end very badly for him, and like a man who believes the president might pardon him.                      
                    
**Meanwhile, [George Papadopoulos](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/what-on-earth-is-going-on-with-george-papadopoulos?h_sid=2e565cdec9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)—who got the Russia investigation moving in 2016 by bragging drunkenly** about Russians offering him stolen dirt on Hillary Clinton—will face sentencing soon. So naturally his wife (who previously portrayed him as a figure who might bring down the president) went on Tucker Carlson's show and begged Trump to pardon her husband. I’m sure her second husband won’t be such a shitty spy.                                    
             
**While the criminals Mueller has caught try to undermine him,** Trump seems to have [admitted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1003962584352030720) on Tuesday that he pressured Attorney General Jeff Sessions to withdraw his recusal so he could end the Russia investigation. Some things make Mueller's investigation harder; others, like Trump confessing repeatedly to obstruction of justice, make it easier.

[KT Nelson on Twitter: "how is this kid not a parody account"](https://twitter.com/KrangTNelson/status/1004003389473280001)On the heels of the last PSA and Lovett’s rant on Democrat Immigration Policy, I’m wondering the hosts ever addressed how Jon tweeted Obama-era pictures to condemn the current Trump administration?

Like, it’s not a big deal. He got got. So what, it happens. But it’s a little disingenuous to be like “why can’t we get our act together on immigration” when you actively sweep under the rug what your team did when it could help decide what immigration policy was to look like. 

I wish they’d been more forthcoming is all. I mean, they were working with different immigration patterns and national attitudes toward immigration, so their policy was under some dubious ground justifiably restrictive and punitive. But why sweep that under the rug and play blind, deaf, and dumb when levying critique on current Republican immigration policies. 

As always: big fan, critical listener. *"Didn't you guys burn down the White House?"—Trump [incorrectly referencing](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/06/politics/war-of-1812-donald-trump-justin-trudeau-tariff/index.html?h_sid=13d83d3841-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) the War of 1812 in a phone call with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau*

**The final results of the California primary won’t be official until all the mail-in ballots are [counted](http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article212672834.html?h_sid=13d83d3841-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) about a week from now.** But the news (from California and nationally) is *mostly* good for Democrats, with important caveats.                                               
                      
**From [California](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/05/us/elections/results-california-primary-elections.html?h_sid=13d83d3841-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84):**                     
             
- It was very close in the 48th and the 10th districts, but Democrats [avoided being locked out](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/05/2018-primary-election-results-updates-california-626439?h_sid=13d83d3841-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) of any congressional races due to California’s top-two primary system. That means a Democrat will advance to the general election in every single California race.                   
            
- In most of the eight GOP-held California House districts we call the [Crooked 8](https://crooked.com/crooked8/?h_sid=13d83d3841-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), Democrats narrowed their margins with Republicans relative to 2016.                      
           
- Democrats start the general election as [favorites to take Darrell Issa’s 49th district seat](https://crooked.com/crooked8/?h_sid=13d83d3841-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) from Republicans, while most of the Crooked 8 districts will be true tossups. CA-21 (represented by David Valadao) and CA-22 (represented by Devin Nunes) will be reaches.                 
                   
- Also worth noting: Turnout tends to be higher in general elections, but it was [relatively low](http://www.kcra.com/article/early-returns-indicate-low-turnout-in-california-primary/21101913?h_sid=13d83d3841-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) on Tuesday.                    
                 
**Extrapolating California results to the nation at large is tricky, but still promising.** The [cumulative Democratic vote total](https://twitter.com/gelliottmorris/status/1004363675283722241) relative to the 2016 California primary is up, and up enough to be [consistent with a narrow Democratic victory](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/upshot/california-will-have-clues-for-the-nation-how-to-watch-the-primary.html?h_sid=13d83d3841-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;pgtype=collection&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;version=latest&amp;action=click&amp;rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fnate-cohn&amp;contentCollection=undefined) in November. 
                           
               
**That finding matches some anecdotal evidence from around the country:**                           
           
- In Johnson County, IA, a bellwether for Democratic base enthusiasm, turnout in the primary [eclipsed 20 percent](https://twitter.com/drewbulman/status/1004197400783851520), breaking the previous record.           
                      
- Democratic [turnout](https://twitter.com/WinWithJMC/status/1004320538951606272) was up 71 percent over the 2014 midterms outside of California, while GOP turnout was only up five percent.                
             
- Democrat Lauren Arthur [won a special election](http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article212508709.html?h_sid=13d83d3841-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) for a state legislative seat by 19 points in a Missouri district that went for both Donald Trump and Mitt Romney by four points.            
                        
**From Jon Favreau:** The lockout threat in California was real, and Democrats only avoided it thanks to a surge in grassroots organizing and activism, and cooperation between the party, groups like Swing Left and Indivisible, and some of the candidates. Democrats will need to sustain this level of cooperation, energy, and enthusiasm through November to win these California seats and take back the House. It will not be a cakewalk. Because of gerrymandering, Democrats will need a level of turnout that’s not just better than the last midterm election, but historic for any midterm election—particularly among young voters, whose low turnout rates in 2010 and 2014 cost the Democrats dearly. They need to show up in a big way this November.

**BREAKING**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump’s Justice Department has joined a frivolous anti-Obamacare lawsuit, [arguing that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional](https://www.axios.com/trumps-justice-department-says-aca-is-unconstitutional-06f8714d-7606-4104-9982-f057786828a7.html?h_sid=ebb859c7a4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=alerts_all&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=alert&amp;stream=top-stories) and it’s core provisions must therefore be thrown out.** The development does not pose an immediate threat to the law, but represents one of the GOP’s most brazen acts of ACA sabotage since Trump’s inauguration, and breaks with DOJ’s longstanding commitment to defending laws when they can be credibly defended. It marks an effort by the Trump administration to assert that any laws it doesn’t like might come under legal threat by the branch of government tasked with executing them, and is such a blow to the integrity of the DOJ that the career attorneys assigned the case removed themselves from it. As University of Michigan law professor [Nicholas Bagley](https://twitter.com/nicholas_bagley/status/1004866345924689925), who is one of the country's foremost experts on ACA litigation, put it, “I am at a loss for words to explain how big of a deal this is.”                                   
                
**In a statement to Crooked Media, former Solicitor General Don Verrilli, who successfully defended the ACA from two significant challenges** before the Supreme Court, called it “a sad moment.”                                 
               
**“The DOJ has a duty to defend federal laws when reasonable arguments can be made in defense of the law,”** he said. “I find it impossible to believe that the many talented lawyers at the Department could not come up with any arguments to defend the ACA’s insurance market reforms, which have made such a difference to millions of Americans. Just read the brief of the States that intervened to defend the law. A compelling defense of the law is right there in black and white.”                             
                
**America On ICE**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**This week we learned that Pablo Villavicencio, a 35-year-old Ecuadorian man with an American wife and two daughters,** [faces deportation](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/07/us/ice-undocumented-immigrant-arrest-pizza-delivery/index.html?h_sid=ebb859c7a4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) because he delivered pizza to an Army base in Brooklyn, NY. To complete the delivery last week, he needed a visitor’s pass; to get a visitor’s pass, he had to sign a background check waiver. The background check showed an active deportation warrant, so the military police turned him over to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE).                                 
                    
**Villavicencio’s story is horrifying and tragic. Unfortunately it isn’t rare.** President Trump has unleashed ICE, freeing federal agents to target unauthorized immigrants like Villavicencio, who have lived in the U.S. for years, and have American families.                                      
           
**In just the past week, ICE:**

ICE.

**This pattern of abuse has rallied progressive and immigrant-rights advocates to the cause of abolishing or defunding ICE.** This week, Democrats in New Mexico’s first congressional district nominated Democrat [Deb Haaland](https://www.thecut.com/2018/06/deb-haaland-new-mexico-first-native-american-congresswoman.html?h_sid=ebb859c7a4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), who is expected to become the first Native American woman to serve in the House, and who proposes abolishing ICE.                             
                        
**In the meantime, the American Civil Liberties Union has compiled [this tip sheet](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/what-do-if-immigration-agents-ice-are-your-door?h_sid=ebb859c7a4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** to help educate immigrants and the public at large on exercising their rights when ICE agents come knocking.                                       
              
**The Trump administration has made clear that it thinks these stories about terrorized immigrants** are both politically valuable, and a [useful deterrent](https://www.npr.org/2018/05/11/610116389/transcript-white-house-chief-of-staff-john-kellys-interview-with-npr?h_sid=ebb859c7a4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) against further immigration. But if Democrats take back Congress, they will have the power to more effectively expose ICE’s abuses. And the next president can set enforcement priorities that make stories like these exceedingly rare.

**Pruitt has yet to suffer consequences for his unending string of abuses,** but big players in the Republican Party appear to have reached a breaking point with him. This week’s leaks appear to have come from Republicans in Congress and at the White House. [Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA)](https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/1004836333460836359), who said Pruitt’s actions were “about as swampy as you get,” along with other members from ethanol-producing states, have also turned on him. Even [Fox News](https://twitter.com/FoxNewsResearch/status/1004467969873924096) calculated the tab he’s run up with taxpayer dollars while in office. We have found the limit! Maybe!                              
            
**But President Trump supports Pruitt, and continues to praise him publicly.** And by refusing to take any action against Pruitt, he continues to [test the GOP Congress’s appetite for corruption](https://crooked.com/article/scott-pruitt-conservative-trial-run-ignoring-robert-mueller/?h_sid=ebb859c7a4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), which is voracious.

**The President's Other Ill-Fitting Suit**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Late on Thursday, the Justice Department filed a brief in support of a lawsuit that, if successful, would [gut the Affordable Care Act](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/trump-administration-wont-defend-aca-in-cases-brought-by-gop-states/2018/06/07/92f56e86-6a9c-11e8-9e38-24e693b38637_story.html?h_sid=4a90df0803-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.65983357bbcf&amp;noredirect=on)** and eliminate its protections for people with pre-existing conditions.                         
                
**The logic of the suit is convoluted! Here’s the gist:** Congress eliminated the individual mandate penalty when it passed Trump’s corporate tax cuts last year. In 2012, the [Supreme Court upheld the mandate](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2011/11-393?h_sid=4a90df0803-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) under Congress’s power to tax. Now a [group of GOP-led states claims](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/trump-administration-shifted-positions-in-a-lawsuit-against-affordable-care-act-it-wasnt-first-legal-about-face/2018/06/08/c0dd30a8-6b33-11e8-9e38-24e693b38637_story.html?h_sid=4a90df0803-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.8ada81607b47) that, because the mandate “tax” is zero, the law is no longer an exercise of the taxing power. Therefore, the mandate has to go, along with a bunch of protections for pre-existing conditions that the mandate is intended to prop up.                            
               
**Having trouble following that? You’re not alone! Career DOJ attorneys refused to participate in the litigation,** and some of the ACA’s [biggest legal foes](https://twitter.com/jadler1969/status/1004899714272235522) have condemned it. They’ve also pointed out that the challenge is very unlikely to succeed if it ever reaches the Supreme Court.                       
                         
**And yet, the Trump administration is not only supporting the suit, it’s taking the extraordinary step of refusing to defend the law in court—a decision seemingly directed by Trump himself.** In a [letter to Congress](https://www.justice.gov/file/1069806/download?h_sid=4a90df0803-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), Attorney General Jeff Sessions said it was made “with the approval of the president.” Left to his own devices, Sessions might have made this decision anyhow—but [as a senator](https://twitter.com/brianbeutler/status/1005114840577400833), and a nominee, he committed himself firmly to the principle that the Justice Department should defend all laws that the department can credibly defend.     
                                   
**“It has a duty, the Department of Justice does, to defend the laws passed by this body, by Congress,”** Sessions [said at his confirmation hearing](https://www.thisweekinimmigration.com/uploads/6/9/2/2/69228175/hearingtranscript_senatejudiciarysessionsconfirmationhearing_2017-01-10.pdf?h_sid=4a90df0803-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84). “And they should be defended vigorously, whether or not the solicitor general agrees with them.” Yet again, Jeff Sessions’ congressional testimony is best taken with a grain of salt.                          
                   
**Bottom line:** Earlier this week, we warned that Republicans would revive their efforts to repeal Obamacare if the midterm elections go better for them than expected. This legal brief is a testament to that commitment.

**In the past, suicide was primarily prevalent in middle-aged people, but rates have risen among many demographics.** Perhaps most alarming is the staggering [increase in young girls’ deaths by suicide](http://time.com/5296967/kids-injury-deaths-suicide/?h_sid=4a90df0803-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).

**Look No Further than the Crooked Media**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**On *Crooked Conversations*:** Crooked.com Editor in Chief Brian Beutler talks to Harvard’s Laurence Tribe about constitutional law, impeachment, and whether or not Republicans have made themselves immune from it.                                
              
**From Brian:** This was a great conversation based on Tribe’s book *To End A Presidency*. It’ll make you realize the question of impeachment is more complicated and higher stakes than you thought, and might even make you reconsider your views, whichever side you come down on.

**Newly released figures from an anonymous government official show that [nearly 1,800 families were separated by border officials](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-children-exclusive/exclusive-nearly-1800-families-separated-at-u-s-mexico-border-in-17-months-through-february-idUSKCN1J42UE?h_sid=4a90df0803-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;il=0) between October 2016 and February 2018.** In the majority of these cases, the families were reportedly separated for security or health concerns. Last month the Trump administration announced a “zero tolerance” immigration policy, resulting in the prosecution of all adults who cross the border illegally and the ensuing separation of children from their parents. Previously, the only available statistics about these family separations were from a two week period in May 2018.

**Today Trump said he was “seriously” considering a [pardon for Muhammad Ali](https://www.buzzfeed.com/tasneemnashrulla/trump-pardon-muhammad-ali?h_sid=4a90df0803-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.aizaaJ6w9#.ugyNNYKXO)** for evading the draft during the Vietnam War. The thing is, Ali doesn’t need a pardon because his conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court.                             
                   
**Also, Trump wants to meet with the athletes who kneel during the National Anthem to [ask them whom he should pardon](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/08/politics/trump-nfl-athletes-kneeling-pardons/index.html?h_sid=4a90df0803-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** completely missing the point of the anthem protests, and also of the pardon power, which only extends to federal crimes.

**It’s hard to imagine President Trump doing a more efficient job of unwinding the western alliance,** and forging a new one between the United States and authoritarian regimes around the world, than he did this past weekend at the G-7 summit.                              
             
**Trump capped off the weekend by launching a nasty, but typical-for-Trump Twitter [attack on Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-floats-end-to-all-tariffs-threatens-major-penalties-for-countries-that-dont-agree/2018/06/09/a06350be-6bf1-11e8-bea7-c8eb28bc52b1_story.html?h_sid=e74e04516a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;noredirect=on),** and reneging on his commitment to sign a bland joint statement of shared G-7 goals, after Trudeau repeated his objections to Trump’s imposition of tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum.                             
            
**After claiming that Trudeau had stabbed Trump in the back, and [literally suggesting Trudeau would burn in hell](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/10/politics/peter-navarro-justin-trudeau/index.html?h_sid=e74e04516a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** his advisers let on that the purpose of the broadside was to [strengthen Trump’s hand](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-attacks-canada-to-show-north-korea-hes-strong-aide-says/2018/06/10/afc16c0c-6cba-11e8-bd50-b80389a4e569_story.html?h_sid=e74e04516a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.878bcad6a36c) in negotiations with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Because nothing says “trustworthy negotiating partner” like completely disregarding terms you agreed to hours earlier.                                       
            
**Trump used the summit to [advocate for Russian interests](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/09/politics/trump-russia-g8-press-conference/index.html?h_sid=e74e04516a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)—including for readmitting Russia to what was once the G-8** before allies expelled Russia for invading Crimea. He left the G-7 summit early to get to Singapore for his meeting with Kim. Trump has already toyed with the idea of a [second summit](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/390937-trump-may-offer-to-host-kim-jong-un-at-mar-a-lago-for-second-summit?h_sid=e74e04516a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) with the North Korean dictator, and [said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-hell-size-up-kim-jong-un-within-the-first-minute-of-singapore-summit/2018/06/09/68a44aba-6bde-11e8-9e38-24e693b38637_story.html?h_sid=e74e04516a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.a63f38d87119) he hopes that after meeting Kim this week, “we’ll have liked each other.” If all goes well, they’ll be binge-watching Ballers by the second date.                        
                         
**On Monday, *The Atlantic* quoted a senior Trump official describing the Trump doctrine as “[we’re America, bitch](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/06/a-senior-white-house-official-defines-the-trump-doctrine-were-america-bitch/562511/?h_sid=e74e04516a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).”** As stupid as that is, an equal opportunity disrespect for all foreign nations would actually be an improvement on the foreign policy Trump is actually advancing: “we’re America, bitch” when it comes to the alliance that has maintained peace in the west for 75 years, paired with lenience for autocrats who flatter and are willing to enrich him.

According to the Trump administration, Latin American gang violence is a massive, deadly threat to people in the U.S. but not something people from other countries might legitimately flee from. Because what our immigration system needs is more cruelty.

By law, the White House has to preserve all documents that Trump comes into contact with for the National Archives under the Presidential Records Act, but Trump is famously bad at following laws. Probably because he tore them up.

**This Thursday, the FIFA World Cup will begin in Russia, kicking off a month of soccer/football hysteria basically everywhere in the world, except the United States.** But strangely enough, Russia’s bid to host this year’s tournament features a familiar face for anyone keeping tabs on U.S. politics/the pee tape—Christopher Steele.     
                                            
**More good news:** You don’t even have to pretend to care about soccer, or learn any embarrassing chants, because the U.S. didn’t qualify for this year’s World Cup. Whatever, we’re not allowed to have nice things again until we can prove we won’t elect sociopaths anymore.

**The [Singapore summit](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/12/asia/singapore-summit-intl/index.html?h_sid=4f8a318403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) between President Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un is over,** and we have progressed very little toward America’s goal of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula. But hey, at least we fawned over a murderous dictator!                    
                 
**What did we get?**                            
           
**Basically nothing, even though Trump [propagandists](https://twitter.com/IngrahamAngle/status/1006500176524140544) are [pretending](https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1006494449764110337) as though the president walked out of the summit with North Korea’s entire nuclear apparatus in tow.** Trump and Kim signed a [joint statement](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/12/politics/read-full-text-of-trump-kim-signed-statement/index.html?h_sid=4f8a318403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), which amounted to a watered-down [reiteration of goals](https://www.npr.org/2018/06/10/618738537/u-s-and-north-korea-how-we-got-here?h_sid=4f8a318403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) that both nations have espoused for decades. Trump got no more from North Korea than any other U.S. president has in the past, and significantly less than many. But negotiations between American and North Korean diplomats will continue. And that’s about it. (Don’t believe us? Believe the right-wing Heritage Foundation’s [North Korea expert](https://twitter.com/BruceKlingner/status/1006443791966928896).)
                                  
            
**What did North Korea get?**                                               
                
**More than we did. For starters, [a provisional invite to visit the U.S.](https://twitter.com/AFP/status/1006658867789475842), which Kim has preemptively accepted. (This appears to be turnabout from when Trump [accepted](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/us/politics/north-korea-kim-jong-un-trump.html?h_sid=4f8a318403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) an unofficial invitation to meet with Kim.)** Trump didn’t just meet Kim, but [praised him](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/12/politics/donald-trump-kim-jong-un-loves-his-people/index.html?h_sid=4f8a318403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) as a “smart” and “funny” man who “loves his people.” (His people happen to live in a [horrific prison state](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/world/asia/north-korea-human-rights.html?h_sid=4f8a318403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).) He announced that U.S.-South Korean military exercises (what he called “war games”) would come to an end—an announcement that [surprised and alarmed U.S. allies](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa-military/trump-surprises-with-pledge-to-end-military-exercises-in-south-korea-idUSKBN1J812W?h_sid=4f8a318403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) in South Korea.      
                                   
**Oh, and Trump literally talked up [beachside hotel opportunities in North Korea](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-korea-best-hotels-beaches-trump-kim_us_5b1fc2a1e4b0bbb7a0e18c73?h_sid=4f8a318403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).** Who hasn’t wanted to swim in an infinity pool overlooking mass starvation and squalor?                                 
               
**Bottom Line?**                           
              
**We are better off on a diplomatic footing with North Korea than we were** when Trump was raving about “fire and fury” and the size of his nuclear button. That’s a good thing.                   
                     
**But the summit increased our medium-term risks in two ways:**                                 
               
- **Republicans like [Tom Cotton](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/trump-north-korea-responses-w521447?h_sid=4f8a318403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) argued today that normalizing relations with a nuclear-armed state like North Korea is necessary because their weapons already exist.** During the Obama years, these same Republicans made bad-faith arguments that engaging in diplomacy with aspiring nuclear states like Iran is bad, because they don’t yet have nuclear weapons. This line of argument will create an incentive for dictators to develop nuclear weapons as quickly as possible.                           
                 
- **The situation could deteriorate rapidly if and when Trump comes to believe he’s been [played for a fool](https://twitter.com/cnnbrk/status/1006473156868091904).**                             
                      
**In exchange for all this we’re left to hope that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo can pull verifiable denuclearization out of his hat.** He knows torture isn’t allowed in diplomacy, right?

The administration’s opposition to the merger raised concerns that Trump was using antitrust enforcement as a weapon against political enemies (Time Warner owns CNN), but corporate consolidation is also a huge problem that should be remedied by the government in a non-corrupt way. At this rate of consolidation, we’ll be the United States of Amazon in no time.

If there’s one candidate with a clear majority, that candidate will win. If not, the candidate ranked first by the fewest voters will be eliminated, and those voters’ second-choice candidates will gain their votes instead until a winner emerges. Maine’s GOP Governor Paul LePage has [threatened to not certify the election results](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/12/17453676/paul-lepage-maine-governor-threatening-not-to-certify-tuesday-primary-results-2018-midterms?h_sid=4f8a318403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) because of this system of voting.

**The report concludes that Comey’s violations—and his recommendation that Clinton should not be prosecuted—weren’t politically motivated,** but cites multiple witnesses saying Comey was effectively bullied into harshly criticizing Clinton because he feared right-wing criticism.

**Manafortnight or Two in Jail**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**A federal judge in Washington, D.C. sent President Trump’s former campaign chairman [Paul Manafort to jail](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/15/politics/judge-sends-paul-manafort-to-jail-pending-trial/index.html?h_sid=ff2d0926d6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** after investigators working for Special Counsel Robert Mueller caught him [tampering with witnesses](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/us/politics/paul-manafort-mueller-witness-tampering.html?h_sid=ff2d0926d6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84). It’s the little things.                                            
              
**Trump [bemoaned](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1007679422865006593) Manafort’s “tough sentence,” but it’s not a sentence.** (Guess this means Trump doesn’t understand either usage of the word “sentence.”) Manafort was awaiting trial on supervised release. The judge revoked his bail because he used his freedom to obstruct justice. Now he will await trial in a jail cell. We’re not sad about that!                                
               
**This is perilous for Trump, and good for those of us interested in the pursuit of justice,** because it creates new and enormous pressure on Manafort to cop a plea and cooperate with Mueller’s collusion investigation. This means we are very close to the Flynn, Cohen, Manafort “When I Flip, You Flip, We Flip” parody music video.       
                   
**Manafort is the only American Mueller has accused of crimes to plead not guilty.** Either because he fears retaliation, or because he anticipates a pardon, or because of a combination of the two, the threat of *conviction* hasn’t fazed Manafort at all. He already stands to spend the rest of his life in prison, so Mueller can’t use new charges as further leverage. But spending time in a jail cell, knowing he might never get out again, is just the sort of development that might focus his mind. That, or Vladimir Putin is already helping him dig his way out of there.                         
            
**Which is probably why Rudy Giuliani reacted to the news by [dangling the possibility of a presidential pardon](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-news-rudy-muller-pardons-trump-manafort-20180615-story.html?h_sid=ff2d0926d6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) before him.** Maybe Rudes doesn’t realize Mueller can see him obstructing justice even when he does it through a New York tabloid reporter.

**Meanwhile, Trump continues to insist that the policy is [Democrats’ fault](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1007671131841671169) (it’s not), while Attorney General [Jeff Sessions](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/14/politics/jeff-sessions-immigration-policy-defense-biblical/index.html?h_sid=ff2d0926d6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=247b5abc68-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_06_15_07_46&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=CNN+Five+Things&amp;utm_term=0_6da287d761-247b5abc68-86393421)** and Press Secretary [Sarah Huckabee Sanders](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/14/politics/sanders-immigration-child-separation/index.html?h_sid=ff2d0926d6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=247b5abc68-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_06_15_07_46&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=CNN+Five+Things&amp;utm_term=0_6da287d761-247b5abc68-86393421) fumbled through their bibles looking for verses that might justify this cruelty, and settled on a passage slavery supporters once used to oppose abolition ahead of the Civil War.

They also say he wasn’t shy about using his position for personal gain, reaching out to a Virginia politician to get his daughter into law school. These aides say they felt like “foot soldiers” in Pruitt’s efforts to match the lifestyles of wealthier cabinet secretaries, because he’s an entitled little shit and corrupt as hell. Also, imagine being jealous of Wilbur Ross and Steve Mnuchin. Who knew anyone could be more embarrassing than Paul Ryan?

After controlling for variables, one study found that with each child, a woman’s hourly wages decrease by four percent, while men see their earnings *increase* by six percent when they became fathers.                                   
                
**The number of pregnancy discrimination claims filed has risen annually over the past two decades,** but many more women facing discrimination like this at work lack the means to file legal complaints, or don’t realize that what’s happening to them is illegal.

325 days ago Trump promised 24-hr Hezbollah answer on Twitter: "[i found it i found the saddest tweet of all time](https://twitter.com/MattNegrin/status/1007253373769474048)"In "Wild Wild GOP" from Thursday, Favreau seemed to indicate he's given the idea some thought. It's commonly understood that contributors like Jon Lovett and Erin Ryan and much of the Pod Save the People team are well to the left of Favs.

Is it possible that the abuses of the Trump administration will bring Crooked Media as an enterprise to line up behind the #AbolishICE movement the way they have with Moms Demand Action and Indivisible and Swing Left?

There isn't the same organizational structure yet in place to advocate for the abolition of ICE, but candidates like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Dan Canon have worked with writers on the left ([mostly Sean McElwee of Data for Progress whom Favreau interviewed for his upcoming project](https://twitter.com/jonfavs/status/1001865344623886336)) to get the message out there.

In the House, Republicans are using the leverage Trump has offered to push forward [restrictionist immigration proposals](https://www.axios.com/immigration-votes-house-gop-family-separation-border-396d4855-0ad0-4346-963f-5eb5f2c047fb.html?h_sid=675e652a35-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).                            
                   
**There are three ways this policy can end:** Trump’s surrender; the passage of legislation banning child separation as either a stand-alone bill or as part of a larger immigration bill; or by voting all of the people enabling the policy out of office. What’s also clear: If Democrats pay the ransom, Trump will be emboldened to take more hostages, and in this case, the hostages are literally children.

**From Brian:** Trump has to be stopped because child abuse is barbaric, but also to prevent future atrocities. If he weathers turning children into hostages without being forced to back down, just imagine the menu of horrors that will open up to him.

**President Trump [suspended his policy](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/us/politics/trump-immigration-children-executive-order.html?h_sid=b44f85da0d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) of separating children from parents captured at the southern border today,** but replaced it with a new policy of keeping parents awaiting deportation proceedings jailed together with their children indefinitely.                              
                       
**Trump relented on child separation after [reporters revealed](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/youngest-migrants-held-tender-age-shelters-56016873?h_sid=b44f85da0d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) that the administration had created multiple facilities** for detaining what it euphemistically described as “tender-age” children: a jail for babies and toddlers.

Mexican restaurant** by protesters Tuesday night, reportedly [spearheaded the order](https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/1009452575475818497). It may have been an effort to force Trump’s hand and/or protect the border security of her reputation.                        
              
**What the order does: leaves the zero-tolerance policy underlying child separation in place.** That means all asylum seekers caught crossing the border between ports of entry will still face prosecution, except now they will in many cases be detained with their children. It also conflicts with a court-enforced agreement from 1997 called the Flores settlement, which prohibits the government from keeping children in immigration detention for more than 20 days. It’s unclear how this conflict will be resolved, or whether Trump will merely pivot from blaming Democrats for his family-separation policy to blaming judges.                         
              
**What the order doesn’t do: resolve what will happen to the thousands of children who have already been separated from their parents.** A Department of Health and Human Services official told reporters there will be no special efforts to reunite families, and hundreds of separated children may be orphaned, [according to a former ICE chief](https://twitter.com/JProskowGlobal/status/1009119915348021249). It also does nothing to deter ICE agents Trump unleashed in the country’s interior, who just conducted their [largest raid in recent history](https://www.npr.org/2018/06/20/621810030/ice-carries-out-its-largest-immigration-raid-in-recent-history-arresting-146?h_sid=b44f85da0d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).

One, written by right-wing hardliner Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), would slash legal immigration. The second, a bill reporters refer to as a “compromise” alternative, is only a compromise *among Republicans*—with Democrats shut out of talks. Both partisan immigration bills will likely be unacceptable to Democrats.

**From Dan Pfeiffer:** Trump faced real-time accountability for separating families, and it’s worth looking at why, in the hope of learning lessons for the battles to come.

**Wall Flowers**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**After days of telling us that only Democrats in Congress can prevent family separation at the border,** President Trump is now telling fellow Republicans to [use this crisis for political gain](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1010116816998490113), and only legislate if and when Republicans win in November.                           
                
**“Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November,”** [he tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1010116816998490113) Friday morning, “Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves [sic] this decades old problem [ed note: this is a lie]. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!” (Ew, obviously.)                              
                     
**There’s a simple reason for this reversal: Trump knows he wants a wall. He knows he wants it to be harder for people who don’t look like him to come to America.** But he also knows he can’t get those things from Congress, even with thousands of child hostages in captivity. Any immigration bill that cleared the House with only Republican votes would fail in the Senate, and House Speaker Paul Ryan [can’t even get that done](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-rejects-conservative-immigration-bill-delays-vote-gop-compromise-measure-n885406?h_sid=44ba0b0305-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84). Bills designed to get bipartisan support could clear the House and the Senate, but those wouldn’t be harsh enough for Trump to sign.                                           
              
**The bad news is, unless Republican leaders somehow discover their missing spines, Trump’s separated-family crisis and a brewing indefinite-detention crisis**—which even a humane and competent administration would have a hard time resolving—will fester at least through the midterms in November.                              
                
**If Democrats retake the House, they can conceivably force Trump to accept measures that would fix the problems he created at the border,** and help Dreamers and other immigrants. And they can make headway toward that goal by making reuniting children with their parents a part of their campaign platform.                 
                
**From Brian:** There is a risk, [reflected in punditry](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/trumps-cynical-immigration-strategy-might-work-for-himagain?h_sid=44ba0b0305-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), that Democrats will convince themselves Trump has the better of the politics of immigration, and shy away from taking his cruelty and demagoguery on directly. This would be a tragic error. No matter how much ground Democrats cede to Trump, he will lie and accuse them of supporting open borders anyhow. The best Democrats can do is refuse to reward liars, accept what they’re up against, and support policies they believe will do the most possible good.

**Rep. Steve King (R-IA) has been incredibly racist forever, but under Trump he has [accelerated his transformation](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/us/politics/steve-king-collett-nazi.html?h_sid=44ba0b0305-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** from standard-issue right-wing xenophobe into an advocate for white-purity politics.                           
              
**A couple weeks ago he retweeted a self-described Nazi sympathizer named Mark Collett, who is a prominent British far-right activist.** Today, he described young boys the Trump administration separated from their parents as “[prime MS-13 gang material](http://thehill.com/latino/393666-steve-king-calls-detained-children-prime-ms-13-gang-material?h_sid=44ba0b0305-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),” and earlier this week he lamented that he [doesn’t hear](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-blowtorch-to-the-tinder-stoking-racial-tensions-is-a-feature-of-trumps-presidency/2018/06/20/e95e71dc-73d9-11e8-805c-4b67019fcfe4_story.html?h_sid=44ba0b0305-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.60db107545a1&amp;noredirect=on) Trump “speaking much about race.”
                                         
              
**“For me, there are cultural distinctions that matter,” he said. “Whenever you import large numbers of people from singular cultures, you import the culture, too.”**                                              
                                
**We’re past expecting Republicans to find their consciences. But not only have they said literally nothing about King’s white supremacy,** they continue to treat him as a kingmaker in Iowa politics. That’s unacceptable. It would also be unacceptable for Republican leaders to condemn him meaninglessly on Twitter, and think they’d done enough. And as luck would have it, [there is a better option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_from_the_United_States_Congress?h_sid=44ba0b0305-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).

(Or just tap ‘allow government to access your location data.')

Surprise.                             
             
**Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) has finally discovered that his powers of office extend beyond writing sad tweets and scolding President Trump on the Senate floor.** He’s [threatening to withhold support](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/20/politics/flake-circuit-court-nominees/index.html?h_sid=44ba0b0305-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) for all of Trump’s judicial nominees unless Trump reverses his Cuba and tariff policies. Assuming Democrats align behind him (not always a safe assumption) he could unilaterally grind Trump’s transformation of the judiciary to a halt. Let’s see if he caves and hope he doesn’t. Let’s also ask why THIS was Flake’s line in the sand.                      
                               
**The family separation crisis has given rise to a new issue: there [aren’t enough lawyers](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/21/17479030/immigration-courts-lawyers-trump-family-separation-policy?h_sid=44ba0b0305-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) to handle the sudden influx of urgent immigration cases,** especially now that parents and children have been split up, requiring multiple attorneys.                          
                    
**As part of Trump’s plan to reorganize the federal government, he wants to [house all social safety net programs, including food stamps, under the same organization](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/us/politics/trump-government-overhaul-safety-net.html?h_sid=44ba0b0305-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;nlid=6112595420180622&amp;te=1&amp;nl=morning-briefing&amp;emc=edit_nn_20180622),** potentially leaving millions at risk by making these programs easier to cut. This is not likely to pass in Congress, but it does tell you a lot about Republicans’ true priorities, behind the populist facade.                                    
                      
**Under Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, over 1,200 civil rights probes from the Obama-era Department of Education** have been [quickly closed](https://www.propublica.org/article/devos-has-scuttled-more-than-1-200-civil-rights-probes-inherited-from-obama?h_sid=44ba0b0305-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) without consequences or punishments for wrongdoing largely due to “insufficient evidence.” Elections matter.

The GOP is basically going to run on the fear of immigration in 2018. We can see that narrative lining up now, although they've tripped over themselves in a major way with the children-in-cages thing. Still, we see the very clear signs of them setting the battle field up. We also know that McConnell has elminiated August recess to set up a likely showdown over The Wall. 

The entire immigration "debate" is fueled by fear from the GOP. Fear is the one thing the GOP can consistently rely on to turn voters out and control the national conversation. It sits at the intersection of racism, xenophobia, and criminal justice - three things that are incredibly important to the Trump base. 

It's the perfect fuel for Trump. 

This is why we need to attack the fear mongering itself. It's Trump's most potent tool. We need to make it his weakness. 

I have a few ideas on how to do this, and perhaps better methods will be developed, but I am convinced that we must turn the fear mongering into a weakness if we are to crush in 2018. 

My primary idea is to essentially use Trump supporters' we're-so-tough-and-'murican attitudes against them in contrast to the fear mongering. If they're so tough, why are they so scared of some kids crossing the border? If you have all these guns, why are you so scared of a few dipshits from MS-13? Not even the liberal snowflakes are scared of the immigrants, why are you? Of all the places in the US, you really think some terrorist disguised as a mexican is going to do something near you? Cmon. Why are you so scared... stop letting Trump control you with fear and grab those bootstraps. 

Trump supporters won't respond to compassion or empathy, so let's use their own rough argumentation style against them to deaden the effect of the fear mongering. I would gladly pay a fee to have access to a version where I don't need to fast forward 8 times an episode.

**On Sunday, President Trump called for those who cross into the U.S. illegally to be [sent back immediately without due process](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/24/us/politics/trump-immigration-judges-due-process.html?h_sid=c9663f86bd-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).** Due process is a Constitutional right guaranteed to all people in America, but it’s also how the government determines who is in the country illegally and who is not. So Trump wants to end rule of law so that immigration agents can deport whomever they want, even citizens, without review. Wonderful.

**From Brian:** There are only so many official channels for enforcing moral standards in American public life. One is elections, which happen pretty rarely, and, thanks to gerrymanders and the electoral college, frequently reward popular vote losers. Another is the law, where courts are increasingly stacked against the majority. That makes shame a potent weapon, and it’s little surprise that people invested in the status quo want those who are willing to use shame to unilaterally disarm.

**Gorsuch A Bad Day**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The Republican Party’s theft of a Supreme Court seat in 2016 paid its most awful dividends on Tuesday,** with a 5-4 decision [upholding the third iteration of President Trump’s Muslim travel ban](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-travel-ban.html?h_sid=4839aef586-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), and two other 5-4 decisions that [tilt against access to abortion](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/us/politics/supreme-court-crisis-pregnancy-center-abortion.html?h_sid=4839aef586-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) and in favor of [concentrated economic power](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/us/politics/supreme-court-american-express-fees.html?h_sid=4839aef586-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).                                     
                     
**The upheld travel ban restricts entry to the U.S. from [seven countries](https://twitter.com/jaketapper/status/1011645801179860992): Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Yemen, Syria, and Venezuela.** The original ban included only Muslim-majority countries, but the administration reverse engineered a modified version of the order, which satisfied the Supreme Court’s five conservatives that the text of the ban didn’t demonstrate obvious anti-Muslim animus. Thus, they ruled it could be implemented on national security grounds.                                     
             
**In a separate case, the same justices [struck down a California law](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/us/politics/supreme-court-crisis-pregnancy-center-abortion.html?h_sid=4839aef586-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) that required crisis pregnancy centers to provide women with information about abortion** and other reproductive-health options. They distinguished these laws from analogous red state laws that compel speech from doctors aimed at discouraging abortion, because… none of this shit is on the level.

**All of these decisions are the result of Mitch McConnell’s unprecedented partisan power grab in 2016,** when he refused to grant President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee a hearing.  That decision galvanized conservative voters, and helped Trump-skeptics in the GOP to rationalize voting for him. And Mitch is pretty proud of himself. McConnell once claimed to oppose the Muslim ban. Today, after the ruling was handed down, McConnell tweeted out [this celebratory picture](https://twitter.com/Team_Mitch/status/1011615705568071681).                                    
                             
**From Brian:** If there’s a single image that ought to encourage liberals to take the race for the Senate seriously, it is that photo. Donald Trump is President (with a little help from his Vlad). Neil Gorsuch is a Supreme Court Justice. We can’t change that.  But Democrats can stop Trump from being rewarded with another Gorsuch if they win back the Senate. Then we can be the ones smirking. Remember smirking because you won something? Good feeling.

She distinguished herself with passionate advocacy for policies that would help as many people in her district as possible. People are desperate for resolute moral leadership, and their political energy is frequently going untapped because existing political leaders aren't providing it. In fighting Trump’s second Supreme Court nominee, they can tap it in the same way Ocasio-Cortez did, and get caught fighting. Or they can quit without trying.

**Supremely Screwed**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**There are [signs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/with-trump-supreme-court-coming-democrats-weigh-strategy-1530209462?h_sid=5d2a178898-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) that Democrats won’t even put up a united front against President Trump’s nominee** to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. Democrats are not speaking with one voice, and vulnerable incumbents won’t rule out helping to confirm the nominee in the fall.                                   
             
**This would be a huge mistake. Democrats can’t promise victory, but their odds aren’t zero,** there are very good arguments for providing Trump no votes, and their constituents’ lives and livelihoods are on the line.          
                       
- **On purely moral grounds, Democrats should oppose any change to the ideological balance of the Court** that is likely to place health care, reproductive rights, and LGBT equality at risk.                    
                
- **Trump and his goons are [under federal investigation](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-supreme-court-russia-investigation_us_5b351d00e4b0b745f17c3ffc?h_sid=5d2a178898-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) and/or were indicted and/or already confessed. If any challenges reach the Supreme Court,** Trump may literally be picking a judge in his own case.                                
             
- **The people didn’t vote for two new right-wing justices.** Lockstep opposition to Trump’s nominee would reflect the will of the people (who, of course, will have to live under the rule of whoever is confirmed for decades).                            
             
- **Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell created a [new and extraordinary precedent](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/us/politics/fact-check-supreme-court-senate-confirm.html?h_sid=5d2a178898-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) by preventing Obama from reshaping the Court.** If only for the party’s own dignity, Democrats should be willing to draw a line here. It wouldn’t even cut against existing norms. Won’t someone think of the norms?                                          
           
**The least Democrats can do is give their voters a fighting chance, so losing the Court for a generation** does not become a foregone conclusion. Come on, Senate Dems. Give this all you’ve got.

**And, in case you missed it yesterday, Mueller revealed that Paul Manafort, who managed Trump’s campaign for free,** had an [outstanding $10 million loan](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-manafort/manafort-had-10-million-loan-from-russian-oligarch-court-filing-idUSKBN1JN2YF?h_sid=5d2a178898-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) from Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Paul Manafort has a lot of intersecting problems at the moment.                                              
             
**This news was so alarming to Republicans that they [convened a hearing](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/28/politics/rod-rosenstein-house-hearing-christopher-wray-documents/index.html?h_sid=5d2a178898-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)…**                       
               
**...to discredit the investigation, and set both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray up to be held in contempt of Congress** and possibly fired. They also voted nearly unanimously in support of a non-binding resolution meant to pressure Rosenstein to turn more documents pertinent to the investigation over to Congress.                                                  
              
**Checks and balances?** More like, check out how the GOP has turned the oversight committees of Congress into extensions of the Trump defense team to protect Trump even though they don’t fully know what they’re trying to cover up.

It has very rapidly entered the mainstream of the national policy debate.                                   
                 
In just the past week:                             
               
- **New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio also called for abolishing ICE.**                
                         
- **Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who’s running for the House on a platform that includes abolishing ICE,** defeated Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY) in New York’s Democratic primary.

- **Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) is [drafting a bill to abolish ICE in the House](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/29/17518176/democrats-to-abolish-ice-movement-gillibrand-de-blasio-ocasio-cortez?h_sid=1464c98e03-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** and multiple progressive Democrats have said they will support it.                    
               
- **Nineteen special agents from the Department of Homeland Security, who work under ICE’s umbrella** enforcing international financial and anti-terrorism laws, wrote a letter to Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen [asking her to split ICE’s detention and deportation function off into its own entity](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/us/politics/ice-immigration-eliminate-agency.html?h_sid=1464c98e03-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), because its work is “unnecessarily impacted by the political nature of [ICE’s] civil immigration enforcement.”                                 
               
**From Brian:** “Abolish ICE” is catching on because of a widespread and accurate belief that it’s a cruel, rogue agency. And even if the goal of actually abolishing the agency goes unmet, a party unified in hostility to a government agency can have a huge impact on its functioning. Republicans have channeled their antipathy towards the IRS into starving the agency of funds, which has had a huge impact on the agency’s ability to enforce tax law. A tamed ICE that wasn’t engaged in mass raids and deportations would be an improvement over what we’ve got now.

But if you enjoy laughing at the pain of Patriots fans, then you should watch them before they’re gone. So, uh, distracting from all the drama of the evening... does anyone know when Girls Just Wanna Have Pod will be coming? I'm a big Erin fan and am excited for this. Sorry if I missed this on Twitter or something. Was there a pod today? I haven't seen one in the feed on Google Play. 

EDIT: apparently it was tweeted this morning that the show will be released Friday AM. It's taping tonight. Thanks!Look, I love Lovett or Leave It, and I'm glad people all across America (and in fact, the globe) get a chance to see the crew live, but I feel like Pod Save America specifically loses something when brought to a live audience.  The conversation is less in depth, more lighthearted, and prone to more diversions in conversations.  It's nice once in a while, but it feels like we haven't had a steady stream of standard PSA pods in a long time.Message me if you know of anything. Thank youVery disappointing news this morning. I remember the spiel about Joe Manchin and how we need their votes, but they've already voted in favor of giving Trump more spying powers and betrayed Dreamers twice.

Are they inept of is it all theater? Pelosi knew that the Democrats wouldn't stand up for DACA even as she was giving her speech. What do to? Primary everyone now?Official website doesn't allow it. I use podbean on android which allows it but the desktop site doesn't :/ Downloading and playing on chromebook's media player also doesn't allow it. HelpIs anyone else becoming a bit irritated with the Mueller and FBI lionization? I mean, honestly, Trump definitely was in cahoots with Russia, but Mueller and the FBI aren't really amazing . Am I alone in this?Hey guys, I have been introduced to these podcasts (particularly Pod Save America) and was looking to listen to some and understand a new perspective! What episodes would you recommend to a new comer?Have we learned nothing from the food pyramid? Get that bread out of there! The food pyramid was a lie, you know what I want to talk about this for a second. I specifically want to talk about the only good period of time in history. And it was a two-year period after the release of the food pyramid before they realized it made America gain collectively a trillion pounds because there was a two-year period where the president, and the first lady and the surgeon general and other surgeons and the whole doctors and Richard Simmons, and all of them were saying “remember to get your six servings of bread”. Because it’s’ healthy now. And so, I remember it was one beautiful year and I remember like being over at a friend’s house and we were having like tuna salads and their parents are at the counter just like dancing saying were on a diet and she’s like putting pasta into their bowls being like we can’t eat that tuna salad we’re on a diet. Pasta. That was cool! It was at one time where that was possible. They put bread on the bottom of the pyramid! WHAT? THAT’S CRAZY!
(It was wild.)
It doesn’t get enough coverage. It really doesn’t. It’s a crazy thing. The entire medical community. The FDA, EVERYBODY! 
(This is the real Watergate ya’ll)
They got together and they said make sure you get 6 potatoes every day. AND NO ONE WAS HELD ACCOUNTABLE! NO ONE PAID A PRICE FOR THAT! America gained A TRILLION POUNDS! Oh, fruits and vegetables? 2 or 3 if you’re lucky. 6 slices of bread. Potato! That’s what you need to be healthy. SIX TO TEN! Oh, are you trying to be healthy? Did you have 10 potatoes? Are you crazy? Doctors went on Television! They went to schools! They put it up on the wall at schools! For 5 years! No one ever apologized! They just replaced it! They just put another poster over it and pretended it didn’t happen! Six to ten! Potatoes! WHAT THE FUCK?? How did that..? No accountability for it!Recently there has been some very good and thoughtful discussion on what is wrong with current Democrats that have power in Washington and in the media.


For example, people on the far-left are very sceptical that the Democrats are actually trying to get liberal legislation through. Their view is that Democrats in power know that they will get left leaning/female/minority viewers as long as they speak like they care. But when push comes to shove they aren't willing to actually risk their seat in power to make the hard vote/decision. In their mind most of the Dems are bad faith actors and are diluting the progressive movement by not putting their vote where their mouth is. They also feel that to make progress, Democrats need to make sweeping changes through activism and ground-up movements without being hampered by corporate influence. And that their ideals would be very popular with most of the nation if they are properly marketed to the specific audience.


On the other hand, the more moderate Democrats see the Democrat's actions as them trying to compromise, but the GOP as we know it are bad faith actors and will not actually try and create bi-partisan legislation. In their mind, the GOP is only about 33-40% of the country and their voters are the cause of the current Republican platform racist ideology. The other more moderate Republicans, Independents, and disallusioned voters can turn to the Democratic party. They feel that the first step in converting them is to run good candidates that are qualified and who directly appeal to them. In their mind the only way we create good legislation is to incrementally shift the nation as a whole to a more progressive ideology.



I think this a fascinating discussion and hopefully I accurately summarised each side of the progressive movement.


Now a couple questions for you guys...


Should the progressives run more far-left candidates who are staunch in their ideology, but might lose a safe Democratic seat to a republican?


Do you think progressives should out Schumer/Pelosi and put in younger progressive leaders at the cost of losing some of the best Democratic fundraisers?


Do you believe that the Democrats can actually turn Trump supporters if those guys are properly marketed to?I remember a hilarious but short rant where Lovett that Trumps couldn’t do this or that because is brain is broke. Does anyone remember where and when?A little context, I work for FedEx Office in South Bend, IN. As a young, progressive person I hate the fact that the company I work for supports and works alongside the NRA. I posted a tweet directed at FedEx, did not use any vulgar language or anything one would deem hostile. Twenty minutes later I get a call from my manager telling me she just got off the phone with FedEx corporate and that I was ordered to delete the tweet immediately. Needless to say I will be asking how to better get my thoughts across to the higher ups about their business dealings.  I will follow this up with a photo of the tweet since I’m new to Reddit and don’t know how to post the photo along with this textI'm a technology user, not a maker, but I'm thinking that there must be a way to post [the newsletter](https://crooked.com/article/newsletter-what-a-day/) as a post, preserving links etc, to either this sub or a sub of its own with minimal human effort...right?

I would prefer to have it here, where I'm browsing at the end of the day, and it would allow for discussion, etc. I'm thinking something similar to r/xkcd

Anyone up for the task? Any interest? Anyone from Crooked Media seeing this?I just got back from seeing Three Billboards and I was wondering if someone could refresh me on why Ira, Louis and Kara hate it with a passion?With the amount of *shit* that I keep reading about every day I find myself in a perpetual state of stress and pining for the next PSA episode.

So much for 'we don't use that other app anymore!'

(I get it.  Their payment site doesn't use Cash app but it's still kind of funny)

Edit: this a joke. Was this really not that obvious ? ‘It’s still kinda funny’?  Smh.Because it's 50/50 whether I need an M or L shirt.just do it.  Seriously, tonight in Cleveland was just amazing.  *Spoiler warning*  Sherrod Brown, was the guest and the whole show was great.  Sherrod's spectacular wife, Connie Schultz, also ended up sitting in as a guest and stole the show at the end.“Let’s get rid of Trump undermining the office of the White House so we can get back to business as usual—me fighting tooth and nail against womens’ reproductive rights and single payer health care” is such a loathsome and gross viewpoint. And I’m really disappointed that he was paid by Crooked media to write it. Big fan of both. It would be so funny listening to them. Back in July, a few months before the ouster of his subject, Joshua Green published *The Devil’s Bargain*, which openly sought to do two different things: the first was to provide a biography of Steve Bannon with a particular emphasis on how his background fed into his intellectual development and relationship with Trump, and the second was to provide the author’s own interpretation of “what happened” in 2016. It is, commercially speaking, a pretty potent combination as the market for interpretations of 2016 shows no sign of shrinking, and Bannon himself has emerged as the most (or arguably only) journalistically compelling figure in “Trumpland”. As such, Green’s book was accompanied by something of a media flurry, which included reviews in most major media outlets as well as the likes of Kirkus and the New York Review of Books, and interviews with NPR, Charlie Rose and, of course, John Lovett on the August 7 Pod Save America. This media coverage and a long standing interest in conservative intellectual movements that goes back to my National Review reading days, led me to pick up and, if Audible is to be believed, through eight hours and three minutes away on this execrable little book.

Allow me to explain: an author writing a book is going to set out with a certain purpose, in this case a sort of “Education of Steven Bannon” as well as an interpretation of What Happened, but will also have things in the back of their mind that guide how they go about their work. Joshua Green would never admit it, but it is pretty clear two of these things here were the observation he records one journalist making that this would make a good movie, and the second and overwhelming thing is that the movement represented by Bannon is not going anywhere, and if Green wants to be the Breitbart Whisperer he cannot write anything that would jeopardize his access. To call the book apologetic does not begin to do it justice, do say he will not be losing a single interview source is an understatement, this is a book that not only goes out of its way to avoid anything that might be seen as insulting to its subject, it often feels as though a copy of it was sent to Breitbart for screening before it was published.

Now hold on, I hear you saying, this does not seem entirely fair. And sure, I can see the argument that a journalist does not need to take an ethical stance on the issue reported on to be valuable, and anyway there isn’t that much to be gained by yet another piece calling Bannon a racist. But that is not really the issue, the issue is that Green’s need to be “even handed” pretty significantly distorts the issue. Most egregiously, in basically every interview I saw with him, he was asked the obvious question of whether he thought Bannon was a racist, and in every one he gave the same answer that is also in the book, that while he may say some nativist things he never said anything in Green’s presence that was disparaging of black people...which is just ridiculous. Quite apart from the rather dubious claim that racism is a term solely limited to disparaging comments about black people, Breitbart had an entire section devoted to “black crime”. This sort of deliberate obtuseness completely permeates the work, particularly when it gets close to the racially charged nature of Trump’s campaign. Judge Curiel gets a few words, the attack on the Khan’s barely a mention, but here is a whole section on how black people liked the Apprentice, and a pointed mention of how Trump did better among black voters than Romney--a “fact” that Trump apologists love to trot out.

This sort of faux-evenhandedness is most apparent and obvious in the section on the campaign, where the endorsement of the Trumpian interpretation of the campaign events is pretty full throated. This comes in sections both small (he describes Trump’s victory in New Hampshire as a “blowout” despite him only snagging about two thirds of the vote share--in fact Trump’s inability to crest 50% until New York, a massively important aspect of understanding the primary, is entirely unmentioned) and large (the part about Megyn Kelly is, I am comfortable saying, completely disgusting). There is a lot, a whole lot, to criticize about the portrayal of the campaign, so to limit myself I will just note that while Green at length describes a populist, bottom up reaction against coastal elites and big money, entirely unmentioned is that Trump lost the popular vote and that the median Trump voter had significantly higher income than the median Clinton voter. Let alone some wonkier points about the generic Republican being well above the generic Democrat in polling, or how a lot of the states that Trump was able to “take” from Democrats had Republican governors, which points less towards particular qualities of Trump as a candidate and more towards long term trends in state level politics (but seriously, how many What Happened thinkpieces note that Michigan and Wisconsin have Republican governors?). The problem is not that he does not say that the whole Clinton health conspiracy thing was kind of shitty (it is entirely unmentioned), the problem is that the whole analysis of the campaign is just bad. That the bad analysis invariably is aggrandizing to the pretensions of Trump and Bannon is not the real problem, but that aggrandizing quality I think goes some way to explaining why the analysis is bad.

Because the book as a whole is remarkably uncritical in its description of Bannon’s self fashioning. Bannon is fun to write about because he does a lot of the work in terms of fashioning his own mythology. He is the kid from the wrong side of the tracks who forged his own opportunities and had to fight against the blue blood snobbery wherever he went. His support for Trump and “economic nationalism” come from this man of the people background. Now, there is a lot to critique in the Bannon Myth, most obviously the whole “blue collar millionaire” thing. A really good biography of Bannon, of the sort that I am sure will be produced before too long, is going to do that, but that is not this biography. Bannon’s Horatio Alger story is not challenged.

What is particularly not challenged is the sort of macho posturing at the heart of Bannon’s self presentation. The whole “I’m a street fighter”, “I’m a honey badger”, “We’re going to war” schtick is here pretty much without comment. As the CM crew have noted, there is something kind of comical and kind of pathetic about how this out of shape middle aged man constantly talks about getting into “knife fights”, by which he means he will put up mean articles on a website. There is a lot to be said about how Bannon embodies this sort of crisis of masculinity, but instead the picture here is pretty heroic. There is a part midway in the book where an observation of Bannon is noted, that while most journalists were at least somewhat liberal, their real allegiance was to the story, which pretty well sums up the book.

This is not to say the book is worthless. It is the only real biography of the man around right now, and it does a good job of showing his self presentation. I think this book will remain relevant, particularly those who want to understand the internal narrative of the budding far right movement. But I get the sense that something of a counter-narrative is developing around Bannon, a sense that all of the Time covers and Politico #1 spots are a tad hyperbolic when describing someone who held a highly influential position in the White House yet managed to accomplish nothing besides the embarrassing failure of the travel ban and a whole lot of leaking (I think the CM crew and particularly Pfeiffer have done a good job of this). This book is badly behind that curve.What's their Audible promo code? I can't find it online and I don't want to listen to 8 hours worth of old pods to find it.https://twitter.com/ByYourLogic/status/918159809035169793

All this stuff about wanting to hear different perspectives from different people, and they cut out most of his statements from the podcast? Why do this? Why even have him on, given you know his perspective and what he's going to talk about?

Is Lovett really so scared of what Felix has to say about American foreign policy that he decided his listeners could not handle it? Was what he said so much more offensive than the republican who he had on right afterwards to argue for endless war?I was thrilled to go see the show, but I just discovered that I have a final exam for a class that night and there’s no way I can miss it. PM me if you’re interested and we’ll work something out.

If you haven’t yet see the New subreddit theme because you’re on mobile more than desktop, please check out this new theme! I would also like to give a special thanks to /u/picodeguano for working tirelessly on this theme without any monetary compensation at all! This theme tries the hardest to be stylistically close to the new Crooked.com so please let us know if you like it! Thank you so much and thanks again, /u/picodeguano!!

EDIT: user flairs are now live! Please pick one from the sidebar for your convenience!...that they’d do fewer of the Tour podcasts.  They play to the live audience and get ever more shrill and “ironic”.   And boy do they love coining a phrase with “shit” in it— if I have to hear them roar with laughter at “shitburger” (their “hilarious”name for Trumpcare) one more time I’m giving up.  They’re not as adorable as they think they are and it’s getting worse the more popular it gets.  I think nobody on the inside has that perspective.   Most of the people I got on board to listen have started dropping.  Hello fellow friends of the pod! What is the running joke about hissing that incites a rant from Lovett almost every time? I've been listening to the pod for the last 3 weeks and missed the inception of the joke so I feel like I'm missing something every time it comes up. Hope this is the right place to post!Anyone else not getting PSA update on Google play?M(uh)ller, M(you)ller, the occasional M(oh)ller. Only one is correct and it’s driving me nuts. Anybody know a clip of Mueller introducing himself? I want it straight from the horses mouth. Just curious because it seems like many do listen to all, but I personally have no interest and haven’t been able to get into any other than PSA, LIOLI and PSTheWorld (occasionally, not every episode). Tonight was the proudest I've felt about our country in the last two years.  To everyone who knocked on doors, phone banked, donated, and made every other kind of contribution, thank you for your time, money, and energy.  I have to say that I personally thank the Crooked crew for getting me more involved and I know that I'm not alone.  Every one of these live shows the past week has made me swell with hope during the Your Tweets Are Not Enough segments, and all of those people's hard work really made a difference in putting people in office who will do their best to help people.  I know this isn't especially pod-related, but given how influential on us I think these podcasts have been I hope we can all take a moment to appreciate the work that each other has done to make the country better for us all before we go back to the challenges ahead.  Good work, fellow friends of the pod.  Let's go get em.FOTP - Doug Jones faces an uphill battle to win the US Senate race against the notorious Roy Moore.

The Election is December 12th, 2017.

Let's help him by doing what we do best volunteer, donate, and VOTE!

**Healthcare**

* Health care is a right, not a privilege limited to the wealthy and those with jobs that provide coverage.
* Coverage must meet basic standards that protect individuals.
* No woman should be denied coverage of services based on the religious beliefs of her employer.
* We must ensure that quality health care is available not only in our cities, but in rural areas as well.

**A Living Wage**

People in Alabama should not have to work two or three jobs just to provide food, housing and other necessities for their families, often foregoing healthcare and other needs. I strongly support ensuring working Alabamians receive a living wage for their hard work. It is past time. They are then less reliant on the government and those dollars help lift the economy.

**Equal Pay for Equal Work**

Today’s champion for equal pay is Lilly Ledbetter and her battle for equality in Gadsden, Alabama. In the Senate, I will work to extend the spirit of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to make it mandatory that two people, doing the same job with the same qualifications, are paid equally – regardless of their gender.

**Environment**

I want to be perfectly clear: I believe in science.

The consequences of our unchecked use of fossil fuels for our planet and our health have been clear for decades. Period. Clean air and clean water are not controversial. They are essential to our health, our prosperity, and our quality of life. We should be encouraging investment in renewable energy and conservation as ways to create new jobs and make ourselves energy independent.

**Criminal Justice**

As both a former federal prosecutor and practicing attorney, I disagree with the attorney general rolling back sentencing reform efforts. Those sentencing reforms reduced the prison population, saving money that could be better utilized to provide education and services to families.

I support continued efforts at sentencing reform and back creating options for alternative sentencing, seeking to rehabilitate those in the justice system instead of sending all of them to prison at a high cost to their families and to taxpayers.Hey fellow friends. As progressives we need to stand against corporate exploitation. Blue Bottle Coffee was recently bought out by Nestle, one of the most exploitative companies on the planet. It seems like a bad look for a Dem leaning, progressive company to be sponsored by a company like Nestle. I’ve tweeted at the guys and the crooked twitter account to try to request they rethink their relationship. I sent a few links to stories about the harm they do to communities. I can share them in the comments. With the announcement of 3 additional new pods after Crooked Conversations, please look here for the line-up changes for the Crooked Media podcasts!

##Pod Save the World

Originally releases every Wednesday, Tommy has moved the release of each episode on Fridays. Tommy released a video after he [ruined our lives and commutes](https://www.facebook.com/TheCrookedMedia/videos/514656712229271/).

##Crooked Conversations

Debuted earlier this month with not one, not two, but three interesting episodes, this new pod is now taking the Wednesday spot that Pod Save the World left open.

##Majority54

First episode debuts on Friday, 11/17. [Merch](https://store.crooked.com/collections/majority-54) is already available for pre-order.

Keep an eye on this thread for updates on Erin and Ira's respective pods!Personally I'm an undergrad student who found myself with a lot of time on my hands in the summer and fall of 2016 and fell in love with the medium of podcasts, particularly political shows such as NPR Politics, Slate Political Gabfest, etc.

The Run-Up to the election was such a fun time, I remember NPR did episodes every day for the last 20 or so days leading up to the vote, and every day it was like a reaffirmation of my values (Progress good, Trump bad etc), especially after Pussygate.

After the election however, podcasts, much like everything else, were soured for me. I felt lied to, blindsided, and angry, and the friendly milquetoast NPR pods just weren't doing it for me.

I remember the day the first pod dropped; I had never listened to KI1600 but I had time to kill and IMMEDIATELY it was a new obsession. Monday and Thursday could never come soon enough and every time a new pod was announced it was like Christmas.

It's been such a joy to see this fan community grow on Twitter and see this burgeoning media empire unfold in real time.Because I'm cheap and rent is expensiveI love the conversations when they stay on topic/mildly productive, but it very quickly falls into the panel riffing on the subject matter.  That plus the games gives it a WWDTM feel for me.Considering the FCC is going to vote to repeal net neutrality next month, and Crooked Media relies on the Internet to get their content out, I'm incredibly surprised that none of the pods have talked about the importance of net neutrality.I know that three new pods were just announced, but I still have hopes that there will be many new pods to come.  Here are some of the pods (or their rough equivalents) I hope may come to be:

* **Pod Save the Trees**: Given the Trump Administration's recent assault on Environmental policy, it might be worthwhile to keep us updated on what's going on with the EPA, NOAA, NASA, and other related agencies.  Long term, climate change and environmental policy will have a huge impact on our politics.  Even if we can eventually get the National government to move on climate change, there will be a lot of tough (not to mention technical) decisions that we will all have to make.  It would be good to have a group of people who thoroughly understand the issues and alternatives and who can explain these issues to the listening audience.
* **Campaign Startup**: With the recent flurry of first-time Democratic candidates, I think it would be interesting to hear the stories of what it takes to go from average, ordinary working person to local, state, national candidate.  Plus, it might give some people in the audience (who are considering running for office), an idea of what to expect and what kinds of challenges exist.  And finally, it would act as a working record of what actually works to help convince Red/Swing District voters to vote Blue. 
* **Know the Players** (Title in Progress): One thing that I feel like is difficult to keep track of is who is actually influencing politics/policies and what their roles in policy decisions are.  I think more information on the following would really help us better understand the government as a whole:
  * *Government Agencies*: this would explain the history, purpose, and contemporary issues of the agencies; it would hopefully get interviews with their leaders as well
  * *Think Tanks*: same as the agencies, except it would also inform listeners about their politics, policy agendas, and donors
  * *Lobbyists*: same as above
  * *Political Donors*: same as above
  * *Journalists*: same as above
  
* **Pod Save the Miscellany** (Title in Progress): Essentially this would be a show about whatever they want to cover.  It could be a place to try out new ideas and let smaller (but still important) ideas have a place to exist (i.e. important content areas which are not large enough to merit their own podcast). Actually, any of the other podcast ideas could be small feature segments. 

These are just my ideas and I know y'all have more.  I'm curious to know what you think the next new pod should be.Source: https://twitter.com/PreetBharara/status/936003050841440259

EDIT: Double Thursday in the title. Oops.Hey guys!
Just wondering if there are any other European fans of Crooked Media out there. How many of you are there? Where are you from? What do like about Crooked from a European perspective? There should be a group of us! What do you think? :)Does anyone remember, I think it was a couple of weeks ago, in a Pod Save episode, John Favreau and Tommy (I think) talking about their suggestions for new legislation that would help prevent the next malicious administration from doing some of the things Trump is doing?I haven't had a chance to listen to much of anything from Crooked Media over the holidays and thought I'd source you loyal Friends of the Pod about this: have the PSA guys or any of the other content contributors at Crooked Media commented on Michael Wolff's new book about the Trump administration? I'm curious because I vaguely remember the PSA guys saying something either dismissive or negative about post-election books in general (maybe even Game Change or something Clinton-related specifically too), but my memory isn't good enough for me to remember why they didn't like it/them or what the situation was. F&amp;F seems to be causing a bit of a wake, and I'm interested in hearing their take on it. It was a lady talking about Russia, how it was more of a big corporate money laundering issue than a typical partisan sensationalism or whatever the Dems have been portrayed as touting. The core of it was extending the anti corporate sentiments to this issue, using that framing.

It's really big for me since all my leftist friends are circle jerking about "stupid dems obsessed with Russia, it's an excuse for losing" or "Philadelphia doesn't care about Russia" sentiments. Making fun of people for buying the earlier Trump Collusion book. “If you want to run for Congress first have a career that informs how you will act in Congress.”

I’m pretty sure it was an elected official who I think was a Republican if that narrows it down.The one about chirping Oprah and Hanks into running for office like he did to Trump at the correspondents dinner. Seth truly is a friend of the Pod.Hey everyone! I'm so pumped to be going to my first PSA/Lovett live show in London this coming weekend. So I was hoping some superfans might be able to tell us what the experience of going to a live recording is like. So a couple of questions (but feel free to contribute whatever you want):

How long are the shows? Can you expect to hear bonus material that gets edited out later?

Any strict rules? Do they lock up your phones? 

Tips for getting picked for a game (other than wearing merch, of course)? 

Do they ever come out and socialize after the show? 

Anything else?

Thanks!Pod Save America, Pod Save the People, Lovett or Leave It, and Keep It all either have gay hosts or gay co-hosts. Additionally, Tim Miller, who frequently contributes to Crooked Media is also gay. 

Crooked, rightly, in my opinion, frequently receives criticism for being too white and too male. However, I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a high percentage of LGBT+ people featured in one media company, without LGBT+ issues being the explicit focus. I realize that part of this just a function of one of the founders being gay, but it’s still really cool to see, especially as young gay person myself. So, my wife and I were supposed to be out of town for her mom’s 60th, but there was a change of plans and we aren’t leaving until Saturday now, silver lining we can go to the live show!!! Oops, no tickets available, well shit. Thought I would look here first before resorting to Craigslist or a scalper night of. Really never thought I’d have to scalp to get tickets to a podcast. We are both huge fans and would even throw in a round cocktails beforehand at Corner Office. Reddit, a better way to scalp?I don’t think this is necessary a problem specific to Crooked Media per se, but it does kinda irritate me how with a company that has quite a lot of influence over younger people that they don’t really report much on environmental issues such as climate change, water pollution, Native American water rights, etc. 

Am I the only one who feels this way? I feel like these are all really important topics in their own right. It’s their company, so obvi they can do what they want, but I feel like they can really get the message out on this stuff if they just look for the right people. 

Am I alone?after listening to the Erin Gloria Ryan/Alyssa Mastromonaco Crooked Convo I am kinda dying for the new pod. does anyone know if there's a date for its premiere?Trying to find the Pod Save America episode where Jon Favreau tells the story of interviewing with Obama when he was running for Senate and Obama tells him "I don't need a speechwriter."
Help? :) Thanks!I anticipate hearing the London show tomorrow hopefully. Maybe Amsterdam as a Tuesday pod?Hi all. I'm going to be interviewing DeRay ahead of the live D.C. taping of "Pod Save the People," and I don't want to squander my time with him. I'm curious: What would you most want to ask him? Would love to hear your thoughts and what you think would be most interesting to pose to him.The episode where they discuss their frequent use of the word "right" in arguments. Any help would be much appreciated!!
I am feeling ranty after leaving the Lovett or Leave It live show in Oakland. 

Important things out of the way first: the cuck zone is usually funny. And Tim miller's voice does things for me. 

That said, never-trump republicans agree with an awful lot of the horrible things Trump is doing. Trump forgets to include the classy veneer on some standard awful Republican policies. And he does a small number of things that no Republican would do. But republicans support the vast majority of this administration's policies. 

Tim Miller supports policies, politicians, and justices who oppose my right to control my body, his right to marry, and everyone's right to health care (among other things). 

That's not to say he shouldn't be on stage at Crooked Media events.  But he shouldn't be on stage being holier than thou about Steve Wynn without having to speak up for the practical impacts of his policy positions. 

I know he's a friend of the pod but let's ask him some serious questions already. **If We Had State Run Media, Would It Look Different?**

**[Sinclair Broadcast Group](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/business/media/sinclair-news-anchors-script.html?h_sid=f25c6ac5f9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) has been a lightning rod for criticism for years, but this weekend many people woke up to the danger it poses** as a manufacturer of right-wing propaganda. Deadspin posted a video overlaying clips of anchors all reading from a single script decrying “false news.” Sinclair owns and/or operates [173](http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/01/media/sinclair-anchor-promos/index.html?h_sid=f25c6ac5f9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) television stations across the country, and seeing a mashup of Sinclair anchors saying in unison, “This is extremely dangerous to our democracy” felt a bit on the nose.                  
         
[Deadspin on Twitter: "How America's largest local TV owner turned its news anchors into soldiers in Trump's war on the media:"](https://twitter.com/Deadspin/status/980175772206993409)        
            
**This is not the only MAGA content Sinclair shoves down its viewers’ throats.** Stations are forced to air segments featuring Trump stooges like Fox News angry-man Seb Gorka and [Boris Epshteyn](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/boris-epshteyn-television-networks-behavior-235787?h_sid=f25c6ac5f9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) (who literally did communications for Trump), called “must-runs.” This morning, Trump sided with the company [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/980799183425802240) because of course he did.                        
                 
**The LA Times' Matt Pearce reported on a [clause in the contract of a Sinclair employee](https://twitter.com/mattdpearce/status/980800914423406592?h_sid=f25c6ac5f9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) that seeks to penalize those who quit** with large monetary fines, which may be discouraging employees who oppose Sinclair’s motives from resisting. On the other hand, [one lawyer noted](https://twitter.com/renato_mariotti/status/980843231356293121) the contracts are likely unenforceable. Cool company.                
                
**Earlier this year, Crooked contributor Symone Sanders spoke with FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel about Sinclair’s efforts to expand even further** by acquiring Tribune Media in a [Crooked Conversation](https://crooked.com/podcast/thing-media-merger-monster/?h_sid=f25c6ac5f9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) →        
           
**The flipside of Trump’s praise for Sinclair is his renewed political attacks on [Amazon](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/980800783313702918).** Despite [laughable spin](https://www.axios.com/trump-regulation-amazon-facebook-646c642c-a2d7-454b-a9a9-cdc6e4eaef2c.html?h_sid=f25c6ac5f9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) that Trump’s main problem with Amazon is the company’s damaging impact on “mom-and-pop retailers,” it’s plainly obvious that he’s angry with *The Washington Post*, which is also owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Trump expects all media companies, including *the Post*, to be more like Sinclair or risk regulatory punishment.

**In a series of rage tweets, Trump accused asylum seekers of “trying to take advantage of DACA,” and used their plight to advocate for his border wall.** This betrays stunning ignorance of DACA, which only applied to children who have lived in the U.S. since 2007, and which Trump [terminated](https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/05/politics/daca-trump-congress/index.html?h_sid=f25c6ac5f9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) last year.

EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt made this decision at the request of the auto industry, perhaps on his way to drop off the Starbucks gift card he uses to pay “rent” to his lobbyist landlord. Today we also learned that clients of this same lobbyist landlord [had a project approved by Pruitt](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/climate/epa-pruitt-pipeline-apartment.html?h_sid=f25c6ac5f9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) last March.

Obviously not the primary concern, but 97 percent is a strange choice. Either make it look closer, or go for 100 percent, you know? Anyway, Trump likes to praise the winners of rigged elections.

Mueller III informed President Trump’s attorneys last month that he is continuing to investigate the president but does not consider him a criminal target at this point, according to three people familiar with the discussions… The special counsel also told Trump’s lawyers that he is preparing a report about the president’s actions while in office and potential obstruction of justice, according to two people with knowledge of the conversations.”                            
                
**Imagine All The Memos We Haven't Seen Yet**
----------------------------------------------------------------------
**What an awful day... for Paul Manafort and other potential criminals being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.** Manafort had asked the court to [dismiss his indictment](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/14/manafort-mueller-indictment-dismiss-465416?h_sid=6eea81fa04-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), arguing that Mueller lacked the authority to investigate the kinds of financial crimes Manafort has been charged with.                        
                  
**Mueller responded in part with a [heavily redacted memo](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4429556/Response-to-motion.pdf?h_sid=6eea81fa04-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein** that spells out Mueller’s specific authority to investigate Manafort, including “[a]llegations that Paul Manafort [c]ommitted a crime or crimes by colluding with Russian government officials with respect to the Russian government’s efforts to interfere with the 2016 election.” Hey look, it’s the “c” word, coming from the Justice Department.
                                          
                        
**From Brian Beutler: It’s not surprising that Mueller would have this authority.** But a straightforward reading of the memo also suggests that the government *already knows Manafort cooperated with Russians to help Trump*. So Mueller’s task would simply be figuring out if Manafort broke the law. No collusion? No. Collusion.                                  
             
**Mueller also reminded the court (as well as other Trump-adjacent criminals trying to act cool, like they’re totally not worried) that** “a Special Counsel may conclude that investigating otherwise unrelated allegations against a central witness in the matter is necessary to obtain cooperation.” Note to the sketchy goon squad orbiting Trump: Mueller’s sources of leverage are vast. 
                                      
                
**Pruitt's Google Alerts Are Not Improving**

• **Pays below-market rent to a lobbyist landlord who also [funded his previous campaign](https://www.thedailybeast.com/scott-pruitts-dc-lobbyist-landlord-also-funded-his-oklahoma-attorney-general-campaign?h_sid=6eea81fa04-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;ref=wrap)** to be Oklahoma Attorney General.

**Trump’s [latest comment](https://twitter.com/seungminkim/status/981208498804527104) on him:** “I hope he's going to be great.” That’s what you say during the confirmation hearings, not when he’s LED THE EPA FOR A YEAR. Trump generally allows people he likes, such as Pruitt, to go nuts corruption-wise. But this is the same notorious vote of confidence that has preceded just about every departure from this administration. Bye Scott?

**Congrats, You're…Not A Target...Yet?**
---------------------------------------------------------------------
**Late Tuesday, the Washington Post [published a story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mueller-told-trumps-attorneys-the-president-remains-under-investigation-but-is-not-currently-a-criminal-target/2018/04/03/d7832cf0-36c1-11e8-acd5-35eac230e514_story.html?h_sid=4e12250d35-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.402bc49f2423) that contained multiple scoops.**                           
             
**1. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team has reportedly told Trump's lawyers that Trump is a subject, but not at this point a target, of their investigation.** To translate: They are investigating his conduct but have not yet determined whether they are prepared to charge him with crimes.                        
           
**2. They're working on a series of reports on their investigation, starting with one (slated for [this summer](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/04/mueller-may-be-baiting-trump-eyeing-early-summer-release.html?h_sid=4e12250d35-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)) on whether Trump obstructed justice.** They want him to submit to an interview before then in order "to answer the public’s questions."
                       
                    
**3. Trump “has repeatedly expressed an eagerness”** to be interviewed by Mueller. This is what drove his lawyer, John Dowd, to resign (and also do that thing where you rub your whole face and sigh because you can’t believe this is both your client and the president.)                                  
              
**Investigators could still conclude Trump didn't violate any laws.** But in sitting for an interview—he could lie under oath, or perhaps worse, he could tell the truth.                        
            
**At the same time, it is the Justice Department’s position that a sitting president can’t be indicted while in office,** and if he can't be indicted, then it stands to reason he quite possibly *can't* be a target. So the fact that he's been labeled “a subject” might tell us nothing.                           
            
**Now that’s if everything the *Post*’s sources said is true.** But who knows. The White House has never felt obligated to be honest and leaks constantly. Mueller, by contrast, is running an incredibly tight ship, [secretly interdicting and interviewing Russian oligarchs](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/04/politics/mueller-special-counsel-investigation-russian-oligarchs/index.html?h_sid=4e12250d35-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), and who knows what else without a peep. So we are in the dark on a lot of fronts. Beware of speculation.

**This differs slightly from Democrats' off-year and special election victories over the past several months.** The race wasn't technically partisan, and didn't arise unexpectedly.

**Bernie After Reading**
----------------------------------------------------------------------
**Bernie spoke earlier this week in Jackson, Mississippi, and made a point that has been drawing some attention:**                         
                
**[What he said](https://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/bernie-sanders-revolution-needs-black-voters-to-win-but-can?h_sid=45e1ef0afb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.rwwOvEgKN#.vxYLQ56gN):** "The business model, if you like, of the Democratic Party for the last 15 years or so has been a failure. People sometimes don't see that because there was a charismatic individual named Barack Obama, who won the presidency in 2008 and 2012. He was obviously an extraordinary candidate, brilliant guy. But behind that reality, over the last 10 years, Democrats have lost about 1,000 seats in state legislatures all across this country.”                         
                   
**How it played:** Remember the 2016 Democratic primary? It went over a bit like that, which is always a treat.                       
             
**Sanders’ critics [most persuasive point](https://twitter.com/jfreewright/status/981745067076542464):** Implying that Democratic voters were too distracted by Obama's dazzling oratory to notice the collapse of the Democratic Party was an [unwise thing to say](https://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/bernie-sanders-revolution-needs-black-voters-to-win-but-can?h_sid=45e1ef0afb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.xi7DBvoZJ#.osQ6e0KwP).                                 
              
**Sanders’ most persuasive point:** As many observers [have noted](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/10/13576488/democratic-party-smoking-pile-rubble?h_sid=45e1ef0afb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), Democrats shouldn't be blasé about how deep of a hole they are in and how they got there.                               
            
**From Brian Beutler:** Few Democrats argue that the Democratic Party is in great shape, or couldn't have done better under Obama. Nobody should be particularly surprised or offended. Sanders should probably be pressed to explain why what happened under Obama is any different than what happened to every two-term presidency since Eisenhower, and why Democrats' electoral fortunes have improved so much since November 2016 without a radical change in "business model." But getting worked up about it in either direction is silly.

I'm struggling with my school-work-life balance and that has taken a physical and emotional toll on me. All my good friends have graduated and are far away and my family is hundreds of miles away from me. With everything going on I have been extremely depressed.


Especially listening to PSA, LoL, PSTP, and Citations Needed, I get extremely down. It just seems like country not only is going to shit, but has been shit for a large population of this country (and other countries as well) since it's inception. I have called my senators and representatives, but it seems like a waste of my time. I was too far away for the major marches. I feel completely isolated (live in a pretty Republican town) and I feel like there is no one to talk to about anything.


I'm just wondering how you guys stay positive when you are depressed and if you guys talk to therapists it seem counselingJohn and Dan discussed the omnibus, and rightfully pointed out the BS. But the [cloud act](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/cloud-act-dangerous-expansion-police-snooping-cross-border-data) wasn’t mentioned at all.  Why?I'm sure it'll become apparent in the next hour or two but I guess it's about Trump in a meeting ranting about stuff including the Cohen raid? It's just frustrating because I'm seeing these tweets roll in from him and others and don't know what the giant thing going on is. Going to the live pod this Saturday in Minneapolis, but unfortuanatly have to work before and after. 
I am able to escape for the pod, but would like to know some specific parameters to tell my boss. 

So, does it start on time?  Is there more to the show than what we here later on?

Thanks. *"I love government. I'm obsessed with presidents." —[Cardi B](https://www.gq.com/story/cardi-b-invasion-of-privacy-profile?h_sid=a16c4fcdf5-5a0b4483aec9a785adb3e27a)*                         
               
**Monday Night Meltdown**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump completely lost it in the Cabinet Room tonight, calling Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation “an attack on our country,”** in televised [comments to the press pool](https://twitter.com/CNN/status/983484901478379520). Asked whether he [plans on firing Mueller](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/us/politics/trump-cohen-mueller-full-transcript.html), Trump responded, “we’ll see what happens… many people have said you should fire him… I think this is disgraceful and so do a lot of other people, this is a pure and simple witch hunt.” We agree that this is exactly like a witch hunt, if the witches had actually used magic to curse Salem.                  
                    
**Trump also attacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.** He said he would have “put a different attorney general in” had he known Sessions would recuse himself from any 2016 campaign investigations in advance, and he [criticized Rosenstein](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/us/politics/rod-rosenstein-carter-page-secret-memo.html?h_sid=a16c4fcdf5-5a0b4483aec9a785adb3e27a&amp;smid=tw-share) for signing the Carter Page FISA order.                                 
                
**Trump’s rant came in response to news that the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York executed search warrants at the [office and hotel room of Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/us/politics/fbi-raids-office-of-trumps-longtime-lawyer-michael-cohen.html),** after receiving a referral for a warrant from Mueller. Agents seized a variety of records, including those pertaining to payments to Stormy Daniels. According to [*the Washington Post’s*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fbi-seizes-records-related-to-stormy-daniels-in-raid-of-trump-attorney-michael-cohens-office/2018/04/09/e3e43cf4-3c30-11e8-974f-aacd97698cef_story.html?h_sid=a16c4fcdf5-5a0b4483aec9a785adb3e27a&amp;utm_term=.9e1c441ddaf7&amp;noredirect=on) sources, the Justice Department is investigating whether Cohen committed bank fraud and campaign finance violations. Trump called the raid “disgraceful.” We had a slightly less negative reaction.

Trump [blamed](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/982966315467116544) Iran, Russia, and Vladimir Putin himself for supporting Syria’s president Bashar al-Assad, whose forces are believed to be responsible for the attack, though Syrian state media [denies it](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/08/syrian-government-accused-of-chemical-attacks-on-civilians-in-eastern-ghouta?h_sid=a16c4fcdf5-5a0b4483aec9a785adb3e27a). Trump said their attack will be “[met forcefully](https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/983473063550509056),” though he refused to specify when or how.                             
               
**According to Homeland Security adviser Thomas P. Bossert, the administration [has not ruled out](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/us/politics/trump-syria-chemical-attack.html?h_sid=a16c4fcdf5-5a0b4483aec9a785adb3e27a) a retaliatory missile strike.**          
             
**Though Trump condemned the attack, he has not changed his [policy of hostility toward Syrian refugees](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-syria-refugees_us_5acb501be4b07a3485e68a3d?h_sid=a16c4fcdf5-5a0b4483aec9a785adb3e27a).** Under the Trump administration, the U.S. refugee resettlement quota has remained capped at the lowest level in history. Since October of 2017, the U.S. has only resettled 44 Syrian refugees.

**[Exclusive to Crooked.com](https://crooked.com/article/gop-tax-cuts-culture-corruption/?h_sid=a16c4fcdf5-5a0b4483aec9a785adb3e27a):** In a new memo, the Center for American Progress Action Fund details how a key measure added to the corporate tax cuts at the last minute lined the pockets of specific Republicans in Congress. YEAH BABY WE GOT A SCOOP!!!!
                                               
                 
**The memo focuses on a provision Republicans snuck into their tax cut bill days before it became law,** which created a huge windfall for people who make passive real-estate income, and uses public financial disclosure reports to estimate the size of the windfall for individual Republicans. It suggests Democrats will use the argument that Republicans made public policy to enrich themselves on the campaign trail.

**Did You Say Impeachment?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Sunday’s *New York Times* outlined the [Republican Party’s plan](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/us/politics/trump-impeachment-midterms.html?h_sid=a16c4fcdf5-5a0b4483aec9a785adb3e27a) to rally their supporters and divide Democrats** by claiming Democrats will impeach President Trump if they reclaim the House. Though Republicans are wildly exaggerating the impeachment threat and few Democrats have proposed removing Trump from office, they have successfully created a messaging challenge for Democrats. But don’t worry, if there’s one thing Democrats are good at, it’s simple and clear messaging.  :(                                      
                
**The challenge arises from the fact that while some Democrats may worry that running on impeachment would hurt them politically,** it is also impossible for them to ignore Trump’s historic corruption and unfitness for the presidency.                      
                 
**Jon Favreau [argues](https://twitter.com/jonfavs/status/983315294943932416?h_sid=a16c4fcdf5-5a0b4483aec9a785adb3e27a):** "I don’t know any Dem candidates who’ve made impeachment a centerpiece or even an issue in their campaigns. But if Dems win ‘18, of course they should investigate Trump’s corruption and hold him accountable. If Rs wants to run against that, go for it."                  
                 
**One caveat [from Brian Beutler](https://crooked.com/article/donald-trump-deserves-impeachment/?h_sid=a16c4fcdf5-5a0b4483aec9a785adb3e27a):** Dems should be careful not to avoid questions about impeachment by downplaying (and thus normalizing) Trump’s unprecedented conflicts of interest.              
                 
**What Else**
---------------------------------------------------------------------
**The Congressional Budget Office now estimates that Trump’s corporate tax cuts will help drive [trillion dollar deficits](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-09/u-s-budget-deficit-to-balloon-to-1-trillion-by-2020-cbo-says?h_sid=a16c4fcdf5-5a0b4483aec9a785adb3e27a) by 2020.** So sick of winning!

Many in the city haven’t turned their taps on in years and still don’t believe the water is safe for consumption. At least Scott Pruitt is on the job.

To supporters, it raises concerns that Trump spoke to someone from Panama.                               
            
**An internal EPA email shows that Scott Pruitt [explicitly approved a $56,765 raise](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/04/pruitt-epa-raises/557561/) for an aide,** despite claiming he knew nothing about it in a Fox News interview last week.

From Brian: Priyanka’s $56,765 raise is still not approved.

**On Saturday, a fire at Trump Tower [killed resident Todd Brassner](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/nyregion/trump-tower-fire-art-collector.html?h_sid=a16c4fcdf5-5a0b4483aec9a785adb3e27a).** The building (which Trump tweeted was “[well built](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/982750459877380096)”) lacked fire sprinklers on the upper floors. Trump, along with other developers, lobbied against requiring developers to add sprinklers to their buildings, citing burdensome costs.

**Grandparents v. Facebook**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Facebook CEO [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/2018/04/10/b72c09e8-3d03-11e8-974f-aacd97698cef_story.html) started his first day of testimony on Capitol Hill before the Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committees,** where he was asked about privacy, competition, and data security in the wake of abuses by the data firm Cambridge Analytica.                                       
                      
**From Brian Beutler:** A well-conducted Senate hearing on Facebook should address three topics: data security and user privacy, antitrust, and the umbrella issues of who controls information and power in a democracy. Senators in the hearing were by and large only interested in the first issue, and most had a very weak grasp on it. About an hour in, Mark Zuckerberg seemed to relax a bit and find his groove, because he realized most Senators don’t understand the Internet, and are uninterested in forcing him to make major changes.                 
                
**That said, here are some [highlights](https://www.axios.com/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-senate-hearing-cambridge-analytica-1523379666-deabed81-4b5e-43e7-a0aa-0a5855e6d8ee.html?h_sid=7d4a769562-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)!**                      
                        
• Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) asked Zuckerberg the first good question of the day, well into the hearing, about whether Facebook is a monopoly. Zuckerberg responded, “It certainly doesn’t feel that way to me." Tell that to MySpace.                              
           
• Soon after, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) asked Zuckerberg to reveal which Washington, D.C. hotel he was staying at to highlight concerns about personal privacy. (Zuck did not say. Maybe it’s the Trump hotel?)                                     
                   
• He confirmed that members of Facebook’s team had been interviewed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

**We have learned a lot in the past 24 hours about the [FBI’s raid on Michael Cohen’s office, home, and hotel room](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/us/politics/trump-russia-mueller-rosenstein.html?h_sid=7d4a769562-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;smid=tw-share).** During the raid, the FBI reportedly sought records about payments from Cohen, Trump’s lawyer, to adult film star Stormy Daniels and *Playboy* playmate Karen McDougal, as well as records pertaining to David Pecker, the publisher of *The National Enquirer*. Cohen [broke his silence](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/10/politics/michael-cohen-fbi-raid/index.html?h_sid=7d4a769562-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) telling *CNN*’s Don Lemon “I would be lying to you if I told [you] that I am not [worried]." No shit.
                                   
           
**Deputy Attorney General [Rod Rosenstein personally approved the raid](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/us/politics/trump-russia-mueller-rosenstein.html?h_sid=7d4a769562-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, [Geoffrey Berman](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-attorney-trump-appointee-recused-michael-cohen-investigation/story?h_sid=7d4a769562-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;id=54365546&amp;cid=social_twitter_abcn)—a Jeff Sessions appointee who donated to Trump’s 2016 campaign—recused himself from the Cohen investigation. Trump is going to LOVE both of these facts—just kidding, according to CNN, he’s reportedly [considering firing Rosenstein](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/10/politics/trump-rod-rosenstein-robert-mueller/index.html?h_sid=7d4a769562-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).                                  
              
**This whole episode has intensified fears that Trump could move to fire Mueller.** According to a new report from [*the New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/us/politics/trump-sought-to-fire-mueller-in-december.html?h_sid=7d4a769562-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), Trump wanted to fire Mueller over false reports of new subpoenas back in December. His own friends think he could [lose it any minute](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/inside-trumpworld-allies-fear-the-boss-could-go-postal-and-fire-mueller?h_sid=7d4a769562-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;mbid=social_twitter): One Republican source told *Vanity Fair*: “I could see him having a total meltdown and saying, ‘Fuck it, I’m firing all of them.” Press Secretary [Sarah Huckabee Sanders](https://twitter.com/ABC/status/983784367020498945) did little to calm these fears when she asserted that Trump “believes he has the power” to fire Mueller today.                          
                     
**Naturally, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell still [refuses to protect Mueller](https://twitter.com/pdmcleod/status/983771731637751808?h_sid=7d4a769562-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).** Tuesday afternoon he said "I haven’t seen clear indication yet that we need to pass something to keep him from being removed because I don’t think that’s going to happen.” The President is publicly mulling it over, his press secretary says he has the power to do it, eight White House sources told the Times Trump wanted Mueller gone in December, but sure, Mitch, no need. Pathetic.                   
                           
**A new [Quinnipiac poll](https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?h_sid=7d4a769562-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;ReleaseID=2534) says 69 percent of Americans believe that Trump should not fire Mueller. Nice!** Even a majority of Republicans (55 percent) agree.

Ryan claims his decision to retire has nothing to do with politics, and mostly reflects his desire to strike a healthier work-life balance—a balance he’s worked his entire career to make increasingly inaccessible to the non-wealthy. Feel free to let the door hit you on the way out.

Trump will probably be very conciliatory about the whole thing. “Water under the bridge,” his tweet will say.                            
            
**Republicans want you to believe** that since Democrats criticized Comey for his handling of the Clinton email investigation, they’re not allowed to cite anything he says about Trump now. It’s a bad-faith tactic meant to deflect attention away from Comey’s (presumably) explosive revelations. It also comes at a time when Trump is still weighing whether to breach the rule of law by firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and/or Special Counsel Robert Mueller. That would *definitely* deflect attention away from Comey’s book.                                      
                  
**Democrats: Reject Mike Pompeo**

**Outgoing CIA Director, and Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, Mike Pompeo faced a Senate confirmation hearing today.**
                                        
               
**From Crooked contributor [Ben Rhodes](https://crooked.com/article/democrats-vote-mike-pompeo/?h_sid=7de504cb19-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84):** Over the course of a short and volatile political career, Pompeo has advocated regime change in Iran and North Korea, peddled Benghazi conspiracy theories, and politicized intelligence as the director of the CIA. He comes before the Senate at an unusual moment, when his party’s majority has dwindled down to a one-vote margin, and his fate may in fact rest in the hands of the opposition. Senators from both parties should oppose his confirmation.                                    
                  
**CNN reports that Pompeo [may not get a favorable report](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/12/politics/mike-pompeo-confirmation-votes/index.html?h_sid=7de504cb19-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,** thanks to expected opposition from Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and Rand Paul (R-KY). If this happens, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could still bring the nomination to the Senate floor, but to be confirmed, Pompeo would need at least one Democratic senator to break ranks.

**Stop In The Name Of Love Child**

**The *New Yorker* reports that in 2015, American Media Inc., the publisher of the National Enquirer,** [paid Trump Tower doorman Dino Sajudin $30,000](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-national-enquirer-a-donald-trump-rumor-and-another-secret-payment-to-buy-silence-dino-sajudin-david-pecker?h_sid=7de504cb19-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) to kill a story alleging that Trump fathered an illegitimate child with an employee in the 1980s. Sajudin was reportedly made to sign a contract including a $1 million penalty if he spoke about the deal or the information.         
                     
**This is NOT the first time AMI has been [accused of using this tactic](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-a-playboy-model-and-a-system-for-concealing-infidelity-national-enquirer-karen-mcdougal?h_sid=7de504cb19-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) to help Trump.** AMI’s chief executive, David Pecker, is a longtime friend of Trump’s, who has been accused of using payouts to kill damaging stories for Trump in the past.                                     
                
**This afternoon, Sajudin [released a statement](https://twitter.com/mj_lee/status/984515821350342664) all but confirming the story:** "I was instructed not to criticize President Trump's former housekeeper due to a prior relationship she had with President Trump which produced a child.”                              
                    
**Spring Is For Muellers**

**NBC reports that Mueller is instead likely to present an obstruction of justice report to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein even sooner than he had planned.** This report will supposedly address Trump’s firing of James Comey; his involvement in efforts to cover up the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between his campaign leadership and Russian spies; his efforts to squelch cooperation from implicated witnesses by dangling pardons before them; and his attempts to interfere with Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ recusal. Like Peter Jackson and the Hobbit, the question is, how many reports will Mueller need to tell the story right?

Apparently the lesson Republicans have learned from Pruitt’s tenure is why bother pretending?

Others say he seems “less anxious” these days and has been quoting MLK (which is a bit much, let’s be honest). But what else can you do when you’re what stands between the country and a constitutional crisis? Should he get the axe, the next in line to oversee the Mueller investigation is Solicitor General Noel Francisco.                                      
                   
**Democrats are reportedly also bracing for Rosenstein's firing—a bit too well, perhaps.** According to *National Journal*, Top Senate Intelligence Committee Democrat [Sen. Mark Warner](https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/666542/dems-prep-plan-if-rosenstein-is-fired?h_sid=16449cdd16-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) told Democratic colleagues that “they should adhere to a one- or two-day cooling off period if Trump fires Rosenstein." Because the way to confront a President hell-bent on obstructing justice is to just, like, chill man. Activists are rightly planning [mass protests](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mass-protests-planned-if-trump-fires-rosenstein-click-click-c_us_5ad0d867e4b077c89ce83272?h_sid=16449cdd16-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) should Trump do what should be considered the unthinkable. Anyway, there will be plenty of time to cool off when we’re dead.                                  
        
**From Brian Beutler:** The purpose of firing Rosenstein is to eventually replace him with a Trump lackey who will end or sabotage Mueller’s investigation. It's an act of obstruction of justice and a huge deal. It would come as Trump has reportedly [backed out of an interview with Mueller](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-mueller-teams-prepare-move-forward-without-presidential-interview-n865421?h_sid=16449cdd16-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;cid=eml_nbn_20180412), and [pardoned former Dick Cheney aide Scooter Libby](https://twitter.com/mviser/status/984843410606641152), who was convicted last decade of obstruction of justice after refusing to be a cooperating witness for the government.

**The Michael Cohen saga escalated quickly!**                     
                    
• **Sources tell McClatchy that [Mueller has evidence Cohen was in Prague](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article208870264.html?h_sid=16449cdd16-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) during the 2016 campaign,** confirming a portion of the Steele dossier that Mr. “[I’ve-Never-Been-To-Prague-In-My-Life](https://twitter.com/MichaelCohen212/status/818991277685567489)” has vehemently denied since the dossier came to light.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Days before James Comey’s new book, *A Higher Loyalty*, officially hits the shelves,** it has already accomplished its seemingly central purpose of making Trump [ripshit angry](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/984763579210633216). The book doesn't break much new ground—it further describes events that Comey already relayed in testimony, and other details that have leaked to the press over the course of the last year.       
                       
**In the book, Comey [admits](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/13/james-comey-book-hillary-clinton-email-investigation?h_sid=16449cdd16-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) he was convinced Hillary Clinton would win the election,** and that his certainty likely shaped his decision to speak publicly about the then-ongoing Clinton email investigation.

[Ice T on Twitter: "Pee Tape????!  I’m DONE."](https://twitter.com/FINALLEVEL/status/984931303765274625)Do you think it's a good or bad thing that Trump bombed Syria?

Couple notable Democrat politician responses below.

TL;DR: Chuck Schumer came out in support of the bombing, but said it shouldn't be sustained. Nancy Pelosi gave a milquetoast response and said Trump should go through Congress before doing anymore bombing. Kirsten Gillibrand said she did not support the strike and Trump should go through Congress for anymore bombing. Cory Booker didn't say whether he supported the bombing or not, just said Trump should go through Congress for more bombings. Bernie Sanders stated we should hold chemical weapons use accountable, but bombings must go through Congress. Elizabeth Warren supported the bombings, but said Trump needs to go through Congress for anything else. Kamala Harris supported the bombings, but is concerned about the legality.

All in all, I'm disappointed in almost every response. No one questioning the chemical weapons attack in the first place, no one outright stating bombings are bad and that we shouldn't be at war in Syria. Just a lot of "well the Constitution says you should go through Congress" statements and a disgusting amount of support for the bombings.*"It's pretty unbelievable, the world we live in"—[Sean Hannity](https://twitter.com/oliverdarcy/status/985968953854918657?h_sid=d53078261f-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).

**First, presiding Judge Kimba Wood forced the lawyers to reveal the name of a mystery client** that Cohen claims to have given legal advice to in the past year.                              
                
**And that client is Sean Hannity!** But not the one from TV, because that would be insane.

Announcing the strikes Friday, Trump [directed a warning](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/04/14/trump-syria-announcement-iran-and-russia-sot.cnn?h_sid=d53078261f-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) at Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s allies in Iran and Russia.

So today officials said he likely would not impose additional sanctions on Russia without another triggering event. How predictable and weird as always!                              
               
**On a highly related note, the *Washington Post* [reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-a-reluctant-hawk-has-battled-his-top-aides-on-russia-and-lost/2018/04/15/a91e850a-3f1b-11e8-974f-aacd97698cef_story.html?h_sid=d53078261f-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;stream=top-stories&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=.ce362f506fc5) that Trump became furious last month** when he learned the U.S. had imposed a harsher punishment on Russia for poisoning a former spy on British soil than American allies had.

The former FBI director called the sitting president of the United States an unethical and morally unfit liar who conducts himself like a mob boss, and said it’s possible Russian officials have material they could use to blackmail Trump.

**Pompeo And Circumstance**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Breaking tonight, CIA Director Mike Pompeo [made a secret visit to North Korea](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/us-china-trade-dispute-looms-over-trump-summit-with-japans-abe/2018/04/17/2c94cb02-424f-11e8-bba2-0976a82b05a2_story.html?h_sid=0d43f5cbdc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.ab5fc00d9142&amp;noredirect=on) to meet with Kim Jong Un over Easter weekend.** According to the *Washington Post*, Pompeo’s visit was for the purpose of “[laying] groundwork for direct talks” between President Trump and the North Korean leader, which are planned to come later this year. Pompeo’s trip followed his nomination by President Trump to become secretary of state.                              
               
**From Tommy:** This is interesting but unsurprising news. It makes sense to send an emissary in advance of a head-of-state meeting to sort out details. The cynic in me would note that a normal administration would do the staff work before agreeing to a summit, but it’s a good idea. The fact that this happened through intelligence channels is also not surprising. The State Department has been gutted, and often the intelligence community handles negotiations with countries we have no formal diplomatic relations with. As Trump’s secretary of state nominee, Pompeo currently straddles both worlds.                                
             
**How Safe Is The Russia Investigation?**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Mitch McConnell left President Trump [an open door to fire Robert Mueller](https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/986351014822514698?h_sid=0d43f5cbdc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** today by saying he will block bipartisan legislation to protect the special counsel from coming to the Senate floor. 
From Lovett: Who needs that law anyway? Why reassure the country and remove the looming threat of a constitutional crisis? Why provide leadership and patriotism? The worst.                       
                     
**But there have been other encouraging signs** that President Trump will have a hard time quashing Mueller's investigation:        
               
• **On Tuesday, House Speaker [Paul Ryan](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/mcconnell-slams-door-mueller-protection-bill-we-ll-not-be-n866856?h_sid=0d43f5cbdc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) told reporters that his confidence Trump won't fire Mueller** stems from “the kinds of conversations we’ve had,” suggesting GOP leaders have demanded and received private assurances from the White House that Mueller's job is safe.                         
       
• **On Sunday, Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) [told *ABC*](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-15-18-james-comey-interview-clips/story?h_sid=0d43f5cbdc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;id=54470491) the Senate would not confirm a replacement for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein** who won't pledge to protect the Mueller probe.         
                
**Does that mean people should rest easy?** Absolutely not! Remember Collins' [tax bill promises](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/sen-susan-collins-takes-huge-leap-of-faith-with-tax-bill-critics-say-shes-getting-played/2017/12/15/e3b4d342-e1d1-11e7-8679-a9728984779c_story.html?h_sid=0d43f5cbdc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.2c7dfcca00cb&amp;noredirect=on)? Also, Trump could choose to fire, then not replace Rosenstein at all, which would place Solicitor General Noel Francisco in charge of the Mueller investigation. And [no one knows what he’d do](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/17/rosenstein-francisco-attorney-general-solicitor-general-526859?h_sid=0d43f5cbdc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).                             
              
**But this provides supporters of the Mueller investigation a clear lay of the land.** First, more Republican senators should be pressed to match Collins' commitment. Second, Democrats should insist on hauling Francisco before the Senate Judiciary Committee to secure *his* commitment to protect the Mueller investigation as well.

**Advise And Dissent**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**In the past 48 hours we've learned that:**               
            
• **President Trump and his top aides hung U.N. Ambassador [Nikki Haley](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/world/europe/trump-nikki-haley-russia-sanctions.html?h_sid=c7dec8e093-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) out to dry,** reneging on a commitment to impose sanctions on Russia after she had announced them publicly, then blamed her for the ensuing global confusion.                             
              
• **Defense Secretary James Mattis [urged](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/us/politics/jim-mattis-trump-syria-attack.html?h_sid=c7dec8e093-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) Trump to seek approval from Congress** before bombing Syria last week, but Trump ignored him, because, according to the *New York Times*, he "wanted to be seen as backing up a series of bellicose tweets with action." (Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the least credible White House press secretary since the last White House press secretary, [denies](https://twitter.com/HallieJackson/status/986711960631816192) this happened.)                           
        
• **Trump sent his designated secretary of state, current CIA Director [Mike Pompeo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/us-china-trade-dispute-looms-over-trump-summit-with-japans-abe/2018/04/17/2c94cb02-424f-11e8-bba2-0976a82b05a2_story.html?h_sid=c7dec8e093-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;noredirect=on), to North Korea** to lay the groundwork for a summit with Kim Jong Un, then leaked the classified development to the press in what [critics suspect](https://twitter.com/nedprice/status/986398839392342016?h_sid=c7dec8e093-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) was an effort to make Pompeo's [contested nomination](https://crooked.com/article/democrats-vote-mike-pompeo/?h_sid=c7dec8e093-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) a foregone conclusion.                          
               
**These are some pretty big errors, leaks, and oversights.** Each has its own backstory, but they are all symptoms of Trump's unprecedented mismanagement of the federal government. What a fun throughline!                                    
                
**We don’t know for sure why Trump reversed his decision to impose sanctions on Russia,** but forgetting to tell the ambassador to the U.N. about the change speaks to dangerous disorganization and the risk of [hiring a Fox News pundit](http://time.com/5212129/john-bolton-hr-mcmaster-donald-trump/?h_sid=c7dec8e093-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) to be your national security advisor.                
                     
**Likewise, whether Trump had domestic political concerns in mind when he sent Pompeo to North Korea,** he didn’t have a ton of options because he fired his incompetent secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, after Tillerson [gutted the foreign service](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/alarmed-cuts-lack-leadership-200-us-diplomats-call/story?h_sid=c7dec8e093-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;id=54094907).

So a real banner day for how shit shouldn’t be.

**There’s an [island-wide power outage in Puerto Rico](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/18/us/puerto-rico-mass-power-outage/index.html?h_sid=c7dec8e093-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** that was caused by attempted repairs to infrastructure damage from Hurricane Maria. It could take [24 to 36 hours](https://twitter.com/AEEONLINE/status/986627757990916097) for power to be restored for everyone. In a just world, the botched response to Hurricane Maria would lead the news every night until things were fixed.

Closing this loophole in New York’s double jeopardy law would make it easier for the state to prosecute (hypothetically) pardoned Trump aides for crimes like money laundering that are illegal at both the state and federal level.                                   
                
**Somehow [Eric Greitens](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/us/eric-greitens-felony-referral.html?h_sid=c7dec8e093-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) is still the governor of Missouri,** despite repeated calls for his resignation after sexual abuse allegations, as well as a statement from the attorney general’s office saying he may have committed a felony by using his charity’s donor list to fundraise for his campaign. Greitens responded like anyone would in this situation, by filing for a [temporary restraining order](https://twitter.com/eyokley/status/986717229214584835) against Missouri’s attorney general. Not a good guy.

Never Trump book-writer-but-not-vote-caster Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) changed his vote to yes, but will probably give a sternly worded speech about it at some point, or something. Sen Bill Nelson (D-FL), a former astronaut, has criticized Bridenstine for lacking expertise and denying climate change. No Tang for you yet, Jim.

This is an example of the power they have to impact criminal justice and voting rights. Hold your governor accountable to taking action and, if they fail, elect someone better.

**There appears to be a wide consensus within Trump world that the president has committed crimes, and Michael Cohen will probably reveal them to prosecutors.**                        
            
**On Friday, Trump’s former lawyer, Jay Goldberg, advised him not to trust Cohen** because he’s going to fold like Rubio on a debate stage and may already be wearing a wire. In the spirit of whatever the opposite of attorney-client privilege is, Goldberg [spilled all of the beans about this conversation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cohen-would-turn-against-president-if-charged-counselor-warned-trump-1524093151?h_sid=f718f9badf-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;ns=prod%2Faccounts-wsj) to the *Wall Street Journal*, and compared Cohen to Sammy "The Bull" Gravano, who flipped on John Gotti and brought down the Gambino crime family.                          
            
**Don Jr., Eric, and Ivanka [also reportedly think](https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/986799153714999296) Cohen will incriminate Trump,** as do [all of these anonymous sources](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/18/trump-michael-cohen-flip-536926?h_sid=f718f9badf-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) close to Trump. Anthony Scaramucci, who [apparently doesn't understand how a coin toss works](https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/986675654073700353), is a bit more confident in Cohen.                              
                 
**The subtext all of these concerns isn't just that Cohen is less-than-trustworthy.** It’s that Trump did a whole lot of crimes Cohen knows about, since you can’t “flip” on an innocent person. More subtext: All these idiots have seen too many movies.            
                   
**Spare The Rod, Spoil The Trump**

Rosenstein had warned that the memos contain investigative and classified information, but caved—presumably to stave off his own firing. (On the one hand, Comey seems [totally OK with this](https://twitter.com/MarshallCohen/status/987059291638071296). On the other hand, Comey’s political judgment is NOT THE BEST.)

Trump was reportedly so thrilled he “told some of his closest advisers that it’s not the right time to remove [Rosenstein or Mueller] since he’s not a target of the probe." This suggests that Trump:                         
          
• **[Still hasn’t learned the difference](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mueller-told-trumps-attorneys-the-president-remains-under-investigation-but-is-not-currently-a-criminal-target/2018/04/03/d7832cf0-36c1-11e8-acd5-35eac230e514_story.html?h_sid=f718f9badf-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.a7dfcf9271a7) between being the target** of an investigation (which he may not yet be) and being the subject of an investigation (which he clearly is).       
              
• **Plans to obstruct justice the moment justice comes knocking.**                       
              
**From Brian:** Rosenstein now sits at the nexus of all of Trump's legal jeopardy. Firing him and replacing him with a loyalist would allow Trump to obstruct both the Cohen and the Russia investigations, and Trump is telling friends he’ll do just that if and when evidence of his crimes is uncovered.

I'm 5'11 190 and normally wear a L. I hate hearing people on their podcasts, usually some Woke guests, saying "Right?" after every point they make, as it to signal that their argument is truth etched in stone and that we're idiots if we don't agree with every word they say.  If you have an argument to make, then make your case, but it's just such a lazy rhetorical tactic and comes off as arrogant to anyone listening who isn't 100% on board with your position.So, I saw a link that Stamps.com was also an advertiser on Hannity.

**Memo Random**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**James Comey’s memos about his interactions with President Trump [leaked to the press Thursday night](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/us/politics/comey-memos-trump-justice-department.html?h_sid=72db86e4c7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** minutes after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein submitted them to Congress in response to [House GOP threats](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/18/comey-memos-subpoena-republicans-house-536587?h_sid=72db86e4c7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) and demands.                            
              
**Here’s what Republicans got for their efforts:**                       
            
• **Trump is obsessed with the pee tape,** and lied to Comey when he said that he didn’t spend the night in Moscow after the Miss Universe pageant, since his [bodyguard already confirmed that he did](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-bodyguard-testifies-russian-offered-trump-women-was-turned-down-n819386?h_sid=72db86e4c7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84). Nothing says normal and not at all suspicious like a false alibi!        
           
• **Trump was desperate to please Vladimir Putin,** and told Comey he became angry when he learned his now-disgraced national security adviser Michael Flynn [hadn't expedited a phone call](https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-to-give-congress-access-to-comey-memos-1524178710?h_sid=72db86e4c7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) between the two presidents.                  
                
• **The White House leadership (including Trump) was nervous as hell about Flynn.** [Two weeks after the White House learned](https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/987155886991925252?h_sid=72db86e4c7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) Flynn represented a massive national security breach, former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus took the wildly inappropriate step of asking Comey whether the FBI was monitoring Flynn's communications. Trump fired Flynn only after the White House [learned he was being surveilled](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/4/20/17261770/james-comey-memo-trump-flynn?h_sid=72db86e4c7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).                               
              
**From Brian:** House Republicans’ plan is to keep demanding sensitive investigative materials from Rosenstein until they make a demand that he must refuse, at which point they can hold him in contempt of Congress and give Trump an excuse to fire him. It didn't work with the Comey memos, but they’ll surely try again. The situation is so dire that no less a Trump loyalist than Attorney General Jeff Sessions has reportedly told White House Counsel Don McGahn that he [might have to quit if Trump fires Rosenstein](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/sessions-told-white-house-that-rosensteins-firing-could-prompt-his-departure-too/2018/04/20/911ca994-44c7-11e8-bba2-0976a82b05a2_story.html?h_sid=72db86e4c7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.51f5f7754dbb&amp;noredirect=on). (That word “might,” though…)                
            
**All's Well That Ends Wells Fargo**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Despite believing the agency he leads should be abolished,** acting Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Mick Mulvaney has touted a [$1 billion settlement](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/20/wells-fargo-agrees-to-pay-1-billion-to-settle-over-loan-abuses.html?h_sid=72db86e4c7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) CFPB reached with Wells Fargo. As former Director [Richard Cordray](https://twitter.com/RichCordray/status/987320608198414337) notes, the settlement stems from wrongdoing the bureau [uncovered](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-fines-wells-fargo-100-million-widespread-illegal-practice-secretly-opening-unauthorized-accounts/?h_sid=72db86e4c7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) [when Cordray was still director](https://twitter.com/RichCordray/status/987321989714018304).                                            
            
**On the other hand:** The nation’s six largest banks [pocketed $3.6 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/20/the-associated-press-big-banks-saved-3-point-6b-in-taxes-last-quarter-under-new-law.html?h_sid=72db86e4c7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) from the Trump tax cuts in just three months. That’s our Paul Ryan, helping those in need.                          
            
**From [Dan Pfeiffer](https://twitter.com/danpfeiffer/status/987320193377386497):** This is really going to anger voters, but if and only if Democrats make sure they know about it.

**The party seeks millions of dollars in damages,** but the main public value of the development is the hope that the litigation will reach the discovery phase, which would allow DNC lawyers to depose members of Trump’s inner circle and gain access to internal communications and other documents. Which would be bad for them.                          
         
**The Democrats' model for this litigation is the successful suit they filed against the Nixon campaign after Watergate,** which they won. Nixon's campaign ultimately paid the DNC $750,000 on the day Nixon resigned. Fun fact.

From *Pod Save the People* news crew member Clint Smith: It is *definitely* a good thing that more politicians are talking about decriminalizing marijuana, but it’s also the politically safe and palatable thing to do. The more honest conversation around ending mass incarceration demands a completely different level of political courage.

**Federal civil rights prosecutors have [recommended charges](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/civil-rights-prosecutors-recommend-charges-in-death-of-eric-garner/2018/04/20/01d77236-44b4-11e8-bba2-0976a82b05a2_story.html?h_sid=72db86e4c7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.48d856f750ec) against the police officer who used a chokehold against Eric Garner in 2014, ultimately killing him,** but Trump’s Justice Department leaders are hostile to civil rights litigation, and prosecutors are reluctant to move forward with cases they don’t think they can win.

[@AiiGod on Twitter: "yall: 4/20 me, an intellectual: 1/5"](https://twitter.com/AiiGod/status/987217842880757761)So, long story short, I kind of rage-quit listening to crooked media after Jon Lovett said the Dewey Decimal system is outdated in a Tommy John ad (Yes I realize how petty this is, but I have a legit explanation for why I think it matters more than being just a cheap joke.)

But! My sister said someone wrote to him and he apologized in a later episode. As an overly-sensitive librarian, I would really really love to hear his apology. Does anyone remember what episode it's in? 


Edit: This is a genuine and sincere question, I know it's silly, I just thought someone might remember since the original ad was sometime in the last several months I'm pretty sure. *Trump's presidency is "%$&amp;#ing disastrous.

**Democrats Go Pompeii On Pompeo**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**(As in, they froze and got burned?) For a few glorious days, Democratic votes seemed to control the fate of Mike Pompeo,** President Trump's Islamophobic, conspiracy theory-loving nominee to be secretary of state.                             
       
**Fun facts about Mike Pompeo:**                       
            
• One of the House GOP's leading [Benghazi conspiracy theorists](http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/11/pompeo-has-been-undermining-the-state-department-since-the-benghazi-investigation/?h_sid=ba28c7f62e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)     
                  
• Caught [lying about his service](https://splinternews.com/the-cia-says-mike-pompeo-didnt-fight-in-the-gulf-war-1825422682?h_sid=ba28c7f62e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) during the Gulf War                     
         
• Affiliated with [anti-Muslim hate groups](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/us/pompeo-bolton-muslims.html?h_sid=ba28c7f62e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)     
             
• [Bullshitted his way](https://crooked.com/article/democrats-vote-mike-pompeo/?h_sid=ba28c7f62e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) through a Senate Foreign Relations Committee inquiry about Trump's efforts to obstruct justice.          
                
**Before Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) caved to White House pressure,** Pompeo’s nomination was in such jeopardy that the White House [clamored for Democrats' votes](https://twitter.com/WPJohnWagner/status/988394971433721856) after [excluding congressional Democrats from a state dinner](https://twitter.com/jameshohmann/status/988406145957224450) with French President Emmanuel Macron, in defiance of bipartisan tradition.                     
             
**Republicans were so on edge that Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), a man who [held up an Obama nominee until she died](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/282448-obama-nominee-died-after-waiting-two-years-for-confirmation?h_sid=ba28c7f62e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** said Democrats were engaging in “[shameful political behavior](https://apnews.com/bd55f217dbd34812a79d3b7f929a72c1?h_sid=ba28c7f62e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).”                       
         
**But in the end, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) [hailed](http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/384416-manchin-becomes-second-dem-to-back-pompeo?h_sid=ba28c7f62e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) Pompeo's "exemplary career in public service,"** and Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-IN) joined him in pledging his support today. COOL THANKS. Between them and [Sen. Heidi Heitkamp](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/19/politics/heidi-heitkamp-to-vote-for-pompeo/index.html?h_sid=ba28c7f62e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) (D-ND), who announced her support for Pompeo last week, Pompeo stands to be confirmed.                 
                
**From Team Crooked Media:** We are generally sympathetic to the argument that the President gets to pick his team, but we don’t understand why Democrats think there’s a greater political cost to vote against, rather than for, Pompeo, nor do we believe that Pompeo deserves the job on the merits.                            
       
**Anyway, Dems balked so hard the umpire advanced the runners.** (Yikes. Lovett googled “balking.”)                  
               
**Blackmail is Good Now**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Over the weekend, Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, who commissioned the Steele dossier,** [argued](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/21/opinion/sunday/trump-business-mueller-money-laundering.html?h_sid=ba28c7f62e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of the Trump Organization puts Trump in serious jeopardy, and is critical to making sure Trump is running foreign policy in American interests.                         
           
**Conservatives responded by ~~agreeing that our national security trumps partisan politics~~** [arguing](https://twitter.com/ByronYork/status/988008976100085760) that it’s none of our business whether Trump is being blackmailed, and that Mueller should [stick to collusion](https://twitter.com/AriFleischer/status/988059086150356992).    
                      
**More from Brian:** Conservatives are preparing to argue that any crimes Trump committed that weren’t essentially motivated by a desire to cheat during the election are no business of ours, and can’t be investigated legitimately. They’d prefer we remain vulnerable to a potentially enormous and ongoing national security breach than fix it.

**A bystander rushed a gunman [who shot up a Waffle House](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/waffle-house-shooting-tennessee-man-who-wrestled-ar-15-away-n868291?h_sid=ba28c7f62e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) in Nashville, Tennessee.**  James Shaw, Jr. was grazed by a bullet before grabbing the assault rifle and snatching it from the gunman’s hands, burning his own in the process. The attack left four dead, and sparked renewed calls for gun control. The suspect was [arrested today](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/04/23/waffle-house-shooting-travis-reinking-manhunt-continues-nashville-police-say/?h_sid=ba28c7f62e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.7cddd1d32dff).             
              
**Meanwhile, another Waffle House in Alabama is embroiled in controversy after [police threw a black woman to the ground](https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/4/23/17271296/waffle-house-video-police-racism?h_sid=ba28c7f62e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** exposing her breasts, and suggested they’d break her arm if she didn’t cooperate. She had been waiting to receive the district manager’s phone number after refusing to pay for plastic utensils that she had asked for with her order.

**Ahead of a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, South Korea has [turned off the speakers](http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-south-korea-loudspeakers-20180422-story.html?h_sid=ba28c7f62e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) that blare K-Pop and anti-Pyongyang propaganda messages** across the border. (Maybe switch to podcasts?) For its part, North Korea has committed to halting nuclear tests and closing a nuclear test site...for now.         
                    
**Fox News host Sean Hannity interviewed Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson without disclosing millions of dollars in loans he received from the department.** He [argues](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sean-hannity-defends-real-estate-portfolio_us_5addf7a7e4b0df502a4e0b52?h_sid=ba28c7f62e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) that he didn’t know all the details about his investments and also that it’s none of our business. One time there should be a surprising story about Sean Hannity being cool.                           
        
**A [van struck and killed nine pedestrians](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/toronto-van-suspect-alek-minassian-hit-pedestrians-yonge-finch-today-2018-04-23-live-updates/?h_sid=ba28c7f62e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) and injured 16 more in Toronto** before the driver fled the scene, in what is believed to be a deliberate attack. They now have a [suspect in custody](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/driver-who-struck-pedestrians-custody-toronto-police-say-n868466?h_sid=ba28c7f62e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) and believe mental illness was the motive.                           
          
**Mitt Romney [failed to snag the Utah GOP nomination](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-romney/romney-fails-to-win-republican-nomination-for-senate-heads-to-primary-in-june-idUSKBN1HT048?h_sid=ba28c7f62e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) on Saturday,** receiving only 49 percent of delegate votes—far short of the the 60 percent he would’ve needed to clinch. Now he has to face 11 competitors in a June primary, with an electorate that is increasingly hostile to the GOP establishment.                            
       
**Deputy Attorney General [Rod Rosenstein](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/embattled-deputy-attorney-general-rosenstein-argue-case-supreme/story?h_sid=ba28c7f62e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;id=54663460) represented the Trump administration before the Supreme Court** in a criminal sentencing case. It’s not unprecedented for a DAG or attorney general to occasionally stand in for the solicitor general, but in this case it feels very last-meal-before-execution-y.                            
                
**Vice President Mike Pence now plans to name National Security Council official [Lt.

[Michelle Sykora on Twitter: "My sisters guide dog always sneakily walks her into this store without her knowing 😂😍 I love dogs, man"](https://twitter.com/michelesykora/status/987129010873397248)Sorry if this has been asked recently. I searched through the sub but didn't find anything.

what are the 'lyrics' in the Keep it theme? All I can hear when the vocals come on is "hey hey hey hey honk honk" and that feels wrong. 

It may just be that they may not be words, or that it's intentionally hard to decipher. But if not, I sure would love to know. 

Thanks friends. *"In fact I'll get that little piece of dandruff off... We have to make him perfect."—President Trump [making friends](https://twitter.com/DanLinden/status/988791819474554880)* 
             
**BREAKING**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Two stories broke right before I was about to send this newsletter, so we wrote them up for you, because we care:**       
                 
• **According to the [*New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/us/mulvaney-consumer-financial-protection-bureau.html?h_sid=adf880d5c8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), Mick Mulvaney, interim director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,** advised lobbyists and banking executives to increase their contributions to campaigns, saying that when he was in the House, he would only meet with lobbyists who had donated to his campaign. From Dan: “If the *Times*’ account is accurate, Mulvaney has admitted to committing a crime.”                           
                
• **A federal judge in the District of Columbia, appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, has ruled that the Trump administration’s decision to terminate DACA was unlawful,** and that the program must be restarted, unless the Department of Homeland Security can provide a credible justification for ending it within 90 days.                         
         
**Check The User Emmanuel** 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Every few months, the French president pretends not to think the American president is a buffoon,** and good for him! This time it’s for the purpose of convincing Donald Trump to stay in the [Iran deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/world/europe/trump-macron-iran-climate.html?h_sid=adf880d5c8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), which froze Iran’s nuclear program in 2015.                               
           
**Trump will have to decide by May 12 whether the U.S. will withdraw from the agreement.** Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker [said last week](https://www.thedailybeast.com/bob-corker-no-really-trump-is-gonna-kill-the-iran-nuclear-deal?h_sid=adf880d5c8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) that Trump’s almost certainly going to break the deal, and national security adviser John Bolton is also in favor of withdrawing. Macron's goal is to convince him to buck Bolton et al and let the Iran deal live.                                       
          
**In a rational administration, the best argument for staying in, apart from the merits of the deal itself,** would be that breaking a major U.S. commitment weeks before a denuclearization summit with North Korea is BREATHTAKINGLY STUPID. Why would Kim Jong Un enter an agreement with a country that reverses a nuclear deal on a whim? If Trump wants to be remembered as the president who finally solved the crisis on the Korean peninsula, he shouldn't go in to negotiations having just demonstrated his own bad faith with Iran. Maybe Macron is saying that? With a lot of compliments mixed in?                                     
                  
**I'm Sorry Dr. Jackson, Ooh**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Dr. Ronny Jackson’s nomination to run the Department of Veterans Affairs, is [in serious jeopardy](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/us/politics/ronny-jackson-veterans-affairs.html?h_sid=adf880d5c8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** after senators were alerted to allegations that Jackson over-prescribes drugs, has created a hostile work environment, and drinks on the job. Additionally, a 2012 [Inspector General report recommended removing Jackson](https://twitter.com/AP/status/988878565814005760) from his White House role, finding “severe and pervasive lack of trust in leadership.”                                
               
**Jackson, who has served as the White House physician under the past three U.S. presidents,** was nominated by Trump to run the government’s second largest department despite having no significant administrative experience.                                
              
**Trump [all but invited Jackson to remove himself](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/us/politics/ronny-jackson-veterans-affairs.html?h_sid=adf880d5c8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) from consideration on Tuesday,** but has declined to quash the nomination himself, and White House officials confirmed that [Jackson will not withdraw himself](https://twitter.com/finnygo/status/988904390827429889) after meeting with Trump this afternoon. Should Jackson’s nomination falter, it will give the right another opening to hand the V.A. over to a Koch Brothers Approved^TM secretary in favor of privatizing veterans’ health care.                              
                    
**From Brian:** One moral of this story: don’t agree to work for Donald Trump. You will always come out of the experience damaged.

**Keep an eye on Democrat Hiral Tipirneni’s performance in tonight’s [special election](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/24/us/elections/results-arizona-house-special-election.html?h_sid=adf880d5c8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) in Arizona’s eighth district.** Trump won the district by 21 points, and Republicans are expected to hold it, but a narrower margin would be another indication of Democratic strength leading into the 2018 midterms.                          
                
**Thomas Roberts, the host of Miss Universe 2013, [confirmed that Donald Trump was there and spent at least one night in Moscow](https://www.thedailybeast.com/miss-universe-2013-host-thomas-roberts-confirms-trump-stayed-overnight-in-moscow/?h_sid=adf880d5c8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).** Can someone leak Brian the pee tape already?

This is not at all consistent with Sessions’ promise last year to “recuse...from any existing or future investigations of any matter relating in any way to the campaigns for president of the United States.”

His case became a high-profile example of the need for criminal justice reform.

**From Brian:** It’s important in the Trump era for leaders of other democratic countries like Macron to stand up publicly for core liberal values, particularly on high profile platforms with large U.S. audiences. Macron pushed Trump hard to preserve the Iran deal in private, and then made his case to Congress and the American people.

**President Trump is stuck between political and legal woes.** He can't claim a close legal relationship with his probably-going-to-jail fixer Michael Cohen, for political reasons, but distancing himself from Cohen increases his legal jeopardy, because it means more of their correspondence over the years won’t be privileged attorney-client material.                                       
        
**Case in point: [Trump phoned in to *Fox &amp; Friends*](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/26/politics/donald-trump-michael-cohen-fox-and-friends/index.html?h_sid=b025cd6cde-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) this morning and claimed Cohen did only a tiny amount of legal work for him.** It took New York prosecutors overseeing the Cohen investigation about two hours to cite that claim in court as evidence that most of the material the FBI seized from Cohen won't be privileged at all.                                         
            
**Trump went on to tell *Fox &amp; Friends* that he might eventually begin ordering the Justice Department to investigate his enemies** and drop investigations affecting him and his friends.

**Not entirely unrelated: The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 14-7 to advance legislation protecting Special Counsel Robert Mueller.** Republican Senators Thom Tillis (NC), Lindsey Graham (SC), Jeff Flake (AZ), and Chuck Grassley (IA), the committee chairman, joined all Democrats to clear the bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed to never let the full Senate vote on it (because he is fully captured by Trump and it never stops being pathetic).                                                     
       
**Also not unrelated: If you need a good laugh/cry, read this story about all the [desperate things Cohen has done to suck up to Trump](https://www.wsj.com/articles/boss-i-miss-you-so-much-the-awkward-exile-of-michael-cohen-1524767440?h_sid=b025cd6cde-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) over the years,** and all the predictable ways Trump has embarrassed him in return.

**Pruitt told the House Energy and Commerce Committee that he did,** in fact, give his chief of staff permission to give enormous raises to two of his lackeys, in defiance of the White House. This directly contradicts his recent claim to Fox News that he didn't know anything about the raises. It’s totally damning stuff, so presumably nothing will be done.

[Barstool Sports on Twitter: "What was more ice cold: LeBron’s shot or this kid calling it?"](https://twitter.com/barstoolsports/status/989335296306221056)I'm listening to "It's your justice department!" and they just got done discussing Gillibrand's post office banking act. They were going on about how the Democrats' need to build an agenda that includes things like this that isn't status quo, or from previous elections.

Problem is, things like this were apart of the 2016 election. It was a prominent part of Sanders' platform in the primaries and one of the things that the Sanders folks fought to get into the Democratic platform going forward. It's a little irksome that, still, in the Democratic Party, there are calls for a bigger, bolder platform...but what's being asked has already been given. It's been written off as pie-in-the-sky, though, or outright ignored.

So, is this the cycle the party is going through? Or had to go through? The more status quo politicians have to take old or oldish ideas that they previously ignored or actively fought against, and then rebrand them as their own idea? It's cool if thats what has to happen, I suppose, it just seems like a kick in the gonads to the wing of the party that actually drove those ideas in the first place.If you follow Lovett on Twitter, you may have noticed he's been starting a fight with the state of Connecticut over their pizza.

So I think it is time we weigh in as a community.

Is Lovett right or wrong?

**Sixty-five years after hostilities ceased, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-In [pledged to end the Korean War](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/27/asia/korean-summit-intl/index.html?h_sid=ac9409d10e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) Friday morning at a historic summit.** The two leaders also agreed to work toward the goal of a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.                                
          
**The denuclearization question will turn on the success or failure of an anticipated Kim-Trump summit,** and the months of diplomacy that will likely have to follow it.                      
                 
**Absent President Trump’s willingness to meet with Kim, the North-South summit may never have happened.** But it will be difficult for the president to preserve his credibility as a good-faith nuclear-diplomacy negotiator with North Korea if he decides to withdraw from the nuclear deal with Iran. In Brussels on Friday, newly confirmed [Secretary of State Mike Pompeo](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/27/politics/pompeo-iran-north-korea-presser/index.html?h_sid=ac9409d10e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) said, "Absent a substantial fix, absent overcoming the shortcomings, the flaws of the deal, [Trump] is unlikely to stay in that deal past this May."

It’s nice that we all just casually accept how much Trump’s ego figures into the fate of nations. COOL ERA.

**This weekend, law enforcement officials [blew the whistle on the White House’s effort](https://twitter.com/KenDilanianNBC/status/1046248077949063168) to control the investigation,** including by dictating to the FBI a [limited list of four people](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-confusion-surrounding-the-fbis-renewed-investigation-of-brett-kavanaugh?h_sid=21ad505564-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22152&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) agents would be allowed to interview—a list that omitted Kavanaugh’s first accuser, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, and Kavanaugh himself. Agents would have also been prohibited [from pursuing key leads](https://twitter.com/KenDilanianNBC/status/1046819429701627904), i.e. doing their jobs.       
               
**In response to these reports, multiple senators—including [Sen. Jeff Flake](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/flake-fbi-must-do-real-investigation-kavanaugh-n915511?h_sid=21ad505564-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22152&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) (R-AZ)—communicated to the White House that a sham investigation would not be acceptable.** “I’ve had discussions, many yesterday, with my colleagues, with the White House Counsel’s Office...to make sure that any current, credible allegation that has been made is fully investigated,” Flake said at an event in Massachusetts on Monday.        
               
**Flake also made it clear in a separate appearance on [*60 Minutes*](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeff-flake-lindsey-graham-brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-confirmation-inside-the-decision-to-delay-confirmation-hearing/?h_sid=21ad505564-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22152&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive)** that if Kavanaugh lied to the Senate, his nomination will be “over.”       
               
**That’s terrible news for Kavanaugh, because the story he told the Senate in support of his innocence is at odds with [evidence from his youth](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/28/heres-where-kavanaughs-sworn-testimony-was-misleading-or-wrong/?h_sid=21ad505564-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.e51a1a305b42&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22152&amp;noredirect=on):**       
               
- Because Kavanaugh says that he never attended a gathering like the one where Ford says he attacked her, he has claimed under oath that he never blacked out from drinking.        
               
- Because Kavanaugh insists he has always treated women respectfully, he testified that the misogynistic language on his yearbook page doesn’t mean what it appears to mean. Specifically, he claimed the terms “boofing” and “devil’s triangle,” which appear to describe to sex acts, [actually refer to flatulence and a drinking game](https://www.hive.co/email/22071/view/public?h_sid=a74e88cfc5-5a8ce697f17efae1cd8050b2&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22071&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;hash=5df12c318ae6885&amp;utm_source=hive). These are the kinds of factual claims that witnesses could easily debunk.        
               
- Plus a source with knowledged confirmed that Kavanaugh never benched 245 no matter how much Squee vouches for him. “Bro did 220 tops, no spotter.”        
               
**On the Senate floor Monday, Senate Majority Leader [Mitch McConnell](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/409340-mcconnell-senate-will-hold-kavanaugh-vote-this-week?h_sid=21ad505564-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22152&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) said the Senate will “be voting this week”** on Kavanaugh’s nomination, which would not give senators and the public much time to digest the FBI’s findings (which is probably the point). We look forward to Lindsey Graham screaming like a maniac about how this breaks with normal Senate process.        
               
**From Brian:** Whether the FBI digs up enough material to convince Flake and other undecided senators that Kavanaugh misled the Senate, they should have to reckon with *why* the White House tried to rig the background check for three days, if not to prevent agents from finding information that would imperil Kavanaugh’s nomination. Everything Kavanaugh and his supporters have done since the allegations surfaced suggests consciousness of guilt, and Republican senators shouldn’t be allowed to get away with pretending they’ve handled the accusations scrupulously.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Brett Kavanaugh [pressured Yale friends of his](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/mutual-friend-ramirez-kavanaugh-anxious-come-forward-evidence-n915566?h_sid=21ad505564-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22152&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) to speak up on his behalf in advance of the New Yorker article detailing the allegation** that he sexually assaulted Deborah Ramirez at a party. Kavanaugh also claimed under oath that he first learned of Ramirez’s allegation when he read it in the *New Yorker*. Liar liar tequila-shots on fire.         
               
**California enacted a [net-neutrality law](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/technology/net-neutrality-california.html?utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22152&amp;nl=morning-briefing&amp;emc=edit_nn_20181001&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;h_sid=21ad505564-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;nlid=6112595420181001&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;te=1.) over the weekend to guarantee equal access to the Internet, but soon after the governor signed it, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit** against the state, claiming states can’t regulate interstate commerce.

**The United States and Canada struck an agreement to preserve the principles of NAFTA on Sunday, called the [United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/us/politics/us-canada-nafta-deal-deadline.html?utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22152&amp;nl=morning-briefing&amp;emc=edit_nn_20181001&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;h_sid=21ad505564-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;nlid=6112595420181001&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;te=1).** Really rolls off the tongue. It allows U.S. farmers greater access to Canada's dairy market and addresses concerns about U.S. auto tariffs. Congress has 60 days to approve the deal. Trump is pretending that it ends and replaces NAFTA, but he’s [extremely full of shit](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/01/politics/nafta-usmca-differences/index.html?h_sid=21ad505564-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22152&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive). From [Ben Rhodes](https://twitter.com/brhodes/status/1046787980143337473): “Reminder that Obama renegotiated NAFTA through TPP. Trump basically embraces TPP provisions which he trashed, and which would have applied not just to Canada and Mexico but to a huge chunk of Asia, also creating a coalition that could stand up to China.”         
               
**Tesla CEO [Elon Musk](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/29/technology/business/elon-musk-tesla-sec-settlement/index.html?h_sid=21ad505564-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22152&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) has struck a deal with the SEC requiring him to step down as the chairman of Tesla** and pay a $20 million fine after making false statements to investors because he thought his girlfriend would think it was funny.

Though media attention to the growing population of detained children has declined, the government is currently struggling to house the largest population of detained children—13,000—in history. The average time children have spent in custody has increased from 34 days to 59. They are transported overnight in an effort to reduce the number of attempted escapes.

**Meanwhile, [new polling from CNN](https://twitter.com/ericbradner/status/1046852252403728390) has Democrats in two competitive Senate races leading their Republican opponents:**          
               
- Missouri: Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) leads Josh Hawley 47-44          
               
- Nevada: Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) leads Sen. ‘Dirty’ Dean Heller (R-NV) 47-43

**Republicans say the [FBI could complete its background check](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/kavanaugh/card/1538511155?h_sid=e2812f19ee-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22216&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as early as Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning,** despite the fact that, as of this writing, agents have not even contacted Kavanaugh’s first accuser, [Dr. Christine Blasey Ford](https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/1047230127485177856), and have only been conducting an unfettered investigation for one day.       
               
**In fact, multiple key witnesses have gone public with their accounts after the FBI failed to contact them.** This includes one of Kavanaugh’s former college classmates, [Kerry Berchem](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/mutual-friend-ramirez-kavanaugh-anxious-come-forward-evidence-n915566?h_sid=e2812f19ee-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22216&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), who claims to possess evidence that Kavanaugh and his team have been aware of Deborah Ramirez’s assault allegation since at least July, and that he unsuccessfully pressured other classmates to tell reporters Ramirez was lying.        
               
**Her account is additionally damning because it [contradicts Kavanaugh’s sworn testimony](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp/2018/09/27/kavanaugh-hearing-transcript/?h_sid=e2812f19ee-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.e70a9c4adc79&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22216&amp;noredirect=on) that he only learned of Ramirez’s allegation in September,** after Ford went public with hers.

**From Brian:** Kavanaugh’s opponents should brace themselves for the horrifying possibility that undecided senators will ignore everything else we’ve come to learn about Kavanaugh and base their decision entirely upon a background check that contains conflicting accounts of his youth. The fact that any senators remain undecided suggests that, for at least some of them, the materials the FBI provides the Senate will be decisive factors when they vote. If that happens, remember who those senators are, along with all the other senators who help put him on the bench, and dedicate yourselves to ending their political careers.

- **Murkowski:** “I am taking everything into account. I think the president’s comments yesterday mocking Dr. Ford were wholly inappropriate and in my view unacceptable.”       
               
- **Collins:** "The president's comments were just plain wrong."       
               
**That hasn’t prevented the White House from trying to rig the FBI’s background investigation** of the assault allegations, to give undecided Republican senators political cover.        
               
- As of this writing, the White House [hasn’t given the FBI “clear authority” to interview](https://twitter.com/MikeDorning/status/1047537717213638658) either Ford or Kavanaugh—despite the fact that Ford’s lawyers are practically begging for an interview, and promising to provide investigators new information.       
               
- The FBI has also [reportedly failed to contact](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna916146?h_sid=3b41f13b01-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;__twitter_impression=true&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22275) more than 40 people, including friends of both Kavanaugh and his accusers, with information pertinent to the background check.       
               
**From Brian:** It’s probably overthinking things to wonder whether Trump stepped on the strategy to confirm Kavanaugh intentionally, but it isn’t crazy. Setting aside the question of whether Kavanaugh deserves to be a Supreme Court justice (he does not!) the fight over his nomination has, since his first accuser went public, [juiced Republican enthusiasm](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/poll-kavanaugh-hearing-galvanized-republicans-erasing-dem-enthusiasm-edge?h_sid=3b41f13b01-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22275&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), which Republicans sorely need to avoid a wipeout in November.

**Crunch Time**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**We should know for certain whether Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court in a matter of hours.**       
               
**On Friday morning, amid escalating protests on Capitol Hill and around the country, the Senate will hold a [key test vote](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/us-senate-republicans-set-key-vote-on-kavanaugh-nomination-for-friday.html?h_sid=628bfed9ce-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22318&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive)** to end the ongoing filibuster of Kavanaugh’s nomination. If Kavanaugh gets 50 or more votes tomorrow, he’ll be on a glide path to be confirmed Saturday afternoon.       
               
**But the fact that his fate remains unclear is significant, particularly because the [FBI returned its background report](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/04/politics/susan-collins-jeff-flake-kavanaugh-fbi-report/index.html?h_sid=628bfed9ce-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22318&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive)** on the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh late on Wednesday, and it didn’t instantly convince undecided Republicans to vote yes. Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), and Susan Collins (R-ME) remain undecided as of this writing.        
               
**Every Democrat who has looked at Kavanaugh’s file says it the [investigation was a sham](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/sham-cover-so-called-investigation-democrats-blast-fbi-kavanaugh-report-n916701?h_sid=628bfed9ce-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22318&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive).** Operating under White House instructions, the FBI only sought to interview 10 people about the allegations, and only reached nine of them. Dozens of people with relevant information were essentially ignored. By contrast, Republicans held eight separate Benghazi investigations, which lasted years.        
               
**Those whose accounts were not included in the background check include:**       
               
- [Kavanaugh’s college roommate](https://amp.slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/brett-kavanaugh-college-roommate-jamie-roche.html?h_sid=628bfed9ce-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22318&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), James Roche, who claims that Kavanaugh “lied, under oath, like it was nothing,” about his drinking and objectification of women. “He claimed that he occasionally drank too much but never enough to forget details of the night before, never enough to ‘black out.’ He did, regularly. He said that ‘boofing’ was farting and the ‘Devil’s Triangle’ was a drinking game. ‘Boofing’ and ‘Devil’s Triangle’ are sexual references. I know this because I heard Brett and his friends using these terms on multiple occasions.”

Appold, now a Princeton theologian, who says he heard about Kavanaugh exposing himself to Deborah Ramirez at a freshman party within a day or two of the incident.        
               
- Angela Walker, a high school contemporary of Kavanaugh’s, and a friend of Renate Dolphin—the woman Kavanaugh and his friends humiliated in their yearbook by calling themselves “Renate alumni.” She submitted a declaration to the FBI which recounted a house party she attended, where a friend of hers, “warned me not to go upstairs, where the bedrooms were, cautioning me that it could be dangerous.”       
               
- Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. Seriously.       
               
- Brett Kavanaugh. We shit you not.       
               
- Dozens of others.       
               
**From Brian:** Flake is reportedly [“still having issues”](https://twitter.com/elainaplott/status/1047927165797486594) with Kavanaugh, and these public attestations may be way. Kavanaugh’s lies about his youth sound trivial and irrelevant, but only when abstracted from their origins. Why do we care about “boofing?” Because it was in his yearbook. Why do we care about the yearbook? Because it’s a window into his conduct as a teen? Why do we care about that? Because he said drunkenly attacking a woman in his teen years would have been out of character for him. The small lies are important not just because they’re lies, but because they’re falling dominoes that lead to bigger lies. There’s a reason the White House prevented the FBI from interviewing Kavanaugh, and his tendency to deceive was undoubtedly a big part of it.

Then please go to [Vote Save America](https://votesaveamerica.com/dosomething?h_sid=194a988102-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22387&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) and find a volunteer shift for this weekend, because fuck these people →        
               
**Kavanaugh stands to be confirmed by a [historically thin margin](https://twitter.com/rachelwellford/status/1048308997219082240), with the help of three of the four last undecided senators:** Susan Collins (R-ME), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), and Joe Manchin (D-WV). Yeah, that last guy has a D next to his name.       
               
**His fate became fairly clear after all three of them teamed up to end a filibuster of his nomination,** over the objection of 48 Democrats and [Sen. Lisa Murkowski](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/us/politics/lisa-murkowski-brett-kavanaugh-vote.html?h_sid=194a988102-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22387&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) (R-AK)—the one Republican who took the allegations, the lies, and the partisanship seriously.

Which is the same thing as not believing her.

**Activists have already [raised over two million dollars](https://www.crowdpac.com/campaigns/387413/either-sen-collins-votes-no-on-kavanaugh-or-we-fund-her-future-opponent?h_sid=194a988102-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22387&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) to fund Collins’s opponent—money that would have been returned to donors had Collins decided to vote no**—and there are multiple credible Democrats who could plausibly defeat Collins. After Collins announced her support for Kavanaugh, [Susan Rice](https://twitter.com/AmbassadorRice/status/1048305496732491777), who served as President Obama’s U.N.

**From Brian:** Kavanaugh’s ascent to the Supreme Court is a blow for the worst forces in politics. It is a victory of the patriarchy over equality movements like #MeToo; a victory for the forces of deception and bad faith over virtues like ethics and decency; a victory for the maximalist right wing effort to co-opt democratic institutions and turn them into tools of partisan control as a means to preserve minority rule; and a victory for President Trump in his ongoing effort to corrupt the judiciary and the federal law enforcement apparatus. There’s only one lesson to be taken from this outcome and it is for the masses to mobilize as if their lives and livelihoods depend on it—for many of them, it does.

Also, the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances is literally in the first amendment to the Constitution, and if Grassley and other Republicans gave a shit what their constituents think, they might not be so opposed to it.

Since then, the [#MeToo movement](https://www.thecut.com/2018/10/sexual-harassment-harvey-weinstein-allegations.html?h_sid=194a988102-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22387&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) has prompted more women to break their silence about harassment and assault at the hands of society’s most powerful men. The controversy over the looming Supreme Court confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh underscores both the strides the movement has made, the backlash it has generated among privileged white men, and the need to translate the movement’s popular energy into voter mobilization.

**The Senate confirmed Kavanaugh, and Chief Justice John Roberts swore him in Saturday afternoon,** amid protests on the Supreme Court steps, and the revelation that Roberts had sat on [multiple judicial misconduct complaints against Kavanaugh](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/dc-circuit-sent-complaints-about-kavanaughs-testimony-to-chief-justice-roberts/2018/10/06/c7e7b526-c8d0-11e8-b1ed-1d2d65b86d0c_story.html?h_sid=fa3395b241-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.ec69a6716af3&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22436&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;noredirect=on) stemming from his dishonest testimony before Congress. Because judicial misconduct rules do not apply to Supreme Court justices, the complaints are now moot.       
               
**From Brian:** Of the five men who are likely to erode or eliminate the right to choose, and who stand to overrule economic regulation and progressive legislation for decades, two are credibly accused of both sexual misconduct, and lying about their misconduct under oath. Four of the five were nominated to the court by presidents (George W. Bush and Donald Trump) who lost the popular vote and, for different reasons, should never have been inaugurated. Liberals had mostly slept through the Court’s brewing legitimacy crisis, as it became more conservative, and more countermajoritarian. Hopefully Trump’s election, and now Kavanaugh’s confirmation, will awaken them to the theft of the country’s jurisprudence, and get Democrats talking seriously about how to undo the damage.

**Don't Spread Lies**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**In an act of stunning journalistic malpractice, the country’s largest newspaper, *USA Today*, [published an op-ed by President Trump](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/10/10/donald-trump-democrats-open-borders-medicare-all-single-payer-column/1560533002/?h_sid=7940afa573-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22548&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive)** that’s shot through with lies about his party’s health care record and the Democratic health care agenda. The op-ed is abhorrent, but it’s also a window into the most basic truth about the election: Republicans aren’t running on offense about tax cuts, or the Supreme Court, or any aspect of their substantive agenda, because that agenda is hideously unpopular. That’s especially true when it comes to the Republican quest to repeal Obamacare and eliminate protections for people who have pre-existing medical conditions.          
               
**Among Trump’s lies:**           
               
- ”We have seen Democrats across the country uniting around a new legislative proposal that would end Medicare as we know it and take away benefits that seniors have paid for their entire lives.”          
               
- “I also made a solemn promise to our great seniors to protect Medicare. That is why I am fighting so hard against the Democrats' plan that would eviscerate Medicare.”          
               
- ”I promised that we would protect coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions and create new health care insurance options that would lower premiums. I have kept that promise.”          
               
**This is just a small taste of the dishonesty—as [the *Washington Post*’s fact checker noted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/10/10/fact-checking-president-trumps-usa-today-op-ed-medicare-for-all/?h_sid=7940afa573-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.bc6ddb8f866d&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22548&amp;noredirect=on), “almost every sentence” of the op-ed** “contained a misleading statement or a falsehood.” Some facts:            
               
- Many but not all Democrats support expanding Medicare so that it will benefit seniors and non-seniors alike. The most popular Democratic Medicare-for-All plan would expand benefits for seniors.          
                
- Republicans have consistently proposed privatizing Medicare and starving it of funds over time; Trump’s corporate tax cut law [includes provisions that depleted Medicare’s revenue stream](https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/the-facts-on-medicare-spending-and-financing/?h_sid=7940afa573-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22548&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive).          
               
- Trump and his Republican majorities have dedicated themselves to eviscerating protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and continued their assault even today.          
               
**Republicans across the country have told versions of the same lie about the party’s position on pre-existing conditions,** and it’s the most galling lie of all.           
               
- On Wednesday, 50 Republican senators teamed up to [reject a Democratic resolution](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/10/politics/health-care-vote-senate-democrats/index.html?h_sid=7940afa573-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22548&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) that would have withdrawn a Trump administration rule that allows insurance companies to sell junk health plans that don’t guarantee coverage for pre-existing conditions.           
               
- Even before Republicans voted the resolution down, [President Trump threatened to veto it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/democrats-fail-to-overturn-trump-administration-rule-on-junk-insurance-plans/2018/10/10/26335f2c-cca0-11e8-a360-85875bac0b1f_story.html?h_sid=7940afa573-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22548&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive). Because Republicans control Congress and have protected him from accountability, this was the first real veto threat of his entire presidency.          
               
- Trump instructed his [Justice Department](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/06/aca-preexisting-conditions-doj/562442/?h_sid=7940afa573-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22548&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) to support the GOP state attorneys general who are challenging the Affordable Care Act’s pre-existing conditions protections in federal court.           
               
**From Brian:** Republicans spent about a week pretending that a Brett Kavanaugh-based surge of GOP enthusiasm had fundamentally changed the trajectory of the election, but the party’s actual campaign strategy is the same as it ever was: lying about health care and trying to scare their voters about minorities.

**Georgia’s Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp is running against Democrat Stacey Abrams in the state’s gubernatorial election, but with less than four weeks to go before the election, he has [purged voter rolls](https://www.wabe.org/voting-rights-become-a-flashpoint-in-georgia-governors-race/?h_sid=7940afa573-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22548&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive)** and frozen more than 53,000 voter registration applications—more than enough to make the difference in a close election. Throughout his tenure as secretary of state, Kemp’s office canceled more than 1.4 million voter registrations total, and 670,000 registrations in 2017 alone. Nearly 70 percent of voters whose registrations Kemp has frozen are black, whereas 32 percent of Georgians are black, suggesting this is part of a familiar, systematic GOP effort to disenfranchise black voters (who tend to vote for Democrats).            
               
**Simultaneously, the Supreme Court allowed a voter ID provision in [North Dakota](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/heidi-heitkamp-north-dakota-senate-voter-id.html?h_sid=7940afa573-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22548&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) that will prevent thousands of Native American voters from casting ballots next month to take effect.** The provision prohibits people without residential street addresses on their state IDs from voting, and because the U.S. postal service doesn’t deliver to residences on rural reservations, many tribal members use P.O. boxes to get their mail, and list their P.O. box numbers on their IDs.

**#WhereIsJamal**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump really wants to let Saudi Arabia off the hook for murdering the Saudi journalist [Jamal Khashoggi](https://www.vox.com/2018/10/9/17950992/jamal-khashoggi-saudi-journalist-killed-missing-turkey-trump-washington-post?h_sid=458ca694c1-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22588&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive),** who wrote for the *Washington Post* and lived legally in the United States, and the question is why.          
               
**Khashoggi, who had been critical of the Saudi regime, and sought to set up a pro-democracy organization in Washington, entered the Saudi consulate in Turkey on October 2 and never emerged.** Turkish officials say agents of the Saudi regime murdered him and sneaked his dismembered body out of the country.            
               
**At an Oval Office press event Thursday, [Trump](https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1050419885891829760) essentially warned Congress—and signaled to Saudi leaders—that he will not sanction Saudi individuals** for murdering Khashoggi under any circumstances, in order to protect $110 billion in U.S. arms sales to the Saudi kingdom.          
               
**“If it turns out to be as bad as it might be, there are certainly other ways of handling the situation,” [he said](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-signing-s-3508-save-seas-act-2018/?h_sid=458ca694c1-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22588&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=link).** “But I will tell you up front, right now, and I’ll say it in front of senators, they’re spending $110 billion purchasing military equipment and other things. If we don’t sell it to them, they’ll say ‘well thank you very much, we’ll buy it from Russia,’ or, ‘thank you very much, we’ll buy it from China.’” If Trump wanted the Saudis to come clean, the threat of sanctions would be a powerful tool, but the master dealmaker just gave up all of his leverage. Curious.          
               
**On Wednesday, Sens. Bob Corker (R-TN) and Bob Menendez (D-NJ), the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,** [sent a letter to President Trump](https://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/chair/release/corker-menendez-graham-leahy-letter-triggers-global-magnitsky-investigation-into-disappearance-of-jamal-khashoggi?h_sid=458ca694c1-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22588&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), signed by nearly two dozen committee members and others, which triggers provisions of a law called the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. Under the terms of the law, the letter from Corker and Menendez requires the Trump administration to investigate Khashoggi’s disappearance, and, if he was murdered, formally determine within 120 days whether or not to sanction the individuals responsible.           
               
**Trump’s reluctance to upset Saudi Arabia is particularly alarming in light of his actions since Khashoggi went missing,** and reports about how his administration responded to threats against Khashoggi’s safety.           
               
**For days, Trump pretended to know nothing about Khashoggi’s wellbeing.** But as the *Washington Post* reported Wednesday, the [U.S. intelligence community was fully aware](https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/world/national-security/crown-prince-sought-to-lure-khashoggi-back-to-saudi-arabia-and-detain-him-us-intercepts-show/2018/10/10/57bd7948-cc9a-11e8-920f-dd52e1ae4570_story.html?h_sid=458ca694c1-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;__twitter_impression=true&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=.dfd34d0f3b21&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22588&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;noredirect=on) that the Saudis intended to capture and possibly harm Khashoggi, and that intelligence “had been disseminated throughout the U.S. government…contained in reports that are routinely available to people working on U.S. policy toward Saudi Arabia.”          
               
**That almost undoubtedly includes Jared Kushner, who forged a close relationship with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman,** and likely Trump himself. If that intelligence said the Saudis were planning to kill him, then by law the  U.S. government had a “duty to warn” Khasshogi about the danger he faced.          
               
**The world is watching. Trump’s response to this horrific attack will either signal that there will be repercussions** to cracking down on dissent, or that the U.S. will turn a blind eye.          
               
**From Brian:** Speculation about whether the Kushners and Trumps have personal financial interests in the U.S.-Saudi relationship has dogged the administration since Trump took office, and flew to Saudi Arabia for his first official trip abroad. The questions the potential conflicts of interest raise—about what Trump knew when, and why he’s reluctant to take action now—are almost too dark to fathom, but they require answers.

Among other things, West noted that his female-dominated family, growing up without his father, and Hillary Clinton’s prominence left him feeling emasculated, and that he thinks Apple should make Trump a hydrogen-powered "iPlane 1.”              
               
**He also spoke about being misdiagnosed as bipolar, and suffering from sleep deprivation.** For the first time in his life, Trump felt like America feels when Trump rants incoherently about nonsense. He watched Kanye in near total silence, but he never tried to bring the press event to a close. That’s because Trump doesn’t care about Kanye West beyond his usefulness as someone with a large following who’ll praise Trump in public. It’s okay with him if a fallen cultural icon has a meltdown in the Oval Office, so long as he’s wearing a MAGA hat.

- Earlier this month, people descended upon the Capitol to [peacefully protest](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/10/06/police-clear-capitol-steps-chanting-protesters-ahead-kavanaugh-vote/1548499002/?h_sid=6fad979b11-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22657&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.           
               
- At a campaign event earlier this week, [former Attorney General Eric Holder](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/10/10/eric-holder-says-michelle-obama-wrong-when-they-go-low-we-kick-them/1593189002/?h_sid=6fad979b11-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22657&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) riffed on Michelle Obama’s old line—“when they go low, we go high”—like so: “When they go low, we kick ‘em.” Metaphors.          
               
- Also this week, [Hillary Clinton](http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1810/09/ampr.01.html?h_sid=6fad979b11-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22657&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour, “You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about.”          
               
**Here’s the truth: The Kavanaugh protesters and Holder and Clinton are right about what Democrats are up against,** and Democrats shouldn’t get cowed into treating Republicans with kid gloves just because Republicans trick the media into making a big deal about harsh rhetoric. That’s especially so, because the GOP’s whining about civility is obviously disingenuous bullshit.          
               
- Nazis marched in [Charlottesville, VA](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/trump-defends-white-nationalist-protesters-some-very-fine-people-on-both-sides/537012/?h_sid=6fad979b11-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22657&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) last year, murdered a counter protester, and Trump called them “very fine people.”          
               
- Trump has directly [incited violence](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/394128-morning-joe-plays-montage-of-the-many-times-trump-encouraged-violence?h_sid=6fad979b11-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22657&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) at his rallies, where he routinely leads chants about [imprisoning his political enemies](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/us/politics/trump-rally-opponents.html?h_sid=6fad979b11-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22657&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive). Other times, he calls Democrats “[evil](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/evil-becomes-trumps-adjective-choice-his-us-opponents?h_sid=6fad979b11-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22657&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive).          
               
- Republicans have [nominated multiple white supremacists and Nazi-sympathizers](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/9/17525860/nazis-russell-walker-arthur-jones-republicans-illinois-north-carolina-virginia?h_sid=6fad979b11-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22657&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) for federal office this cycle.          
               
- Just today, the [GOP’s gubernatorial candidate in Pennsylvania](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/411176-gop-candidate-says-he-will-stomp-on-tom-wolfs-face-with-golf-spikes-in-ad?h_sid=6fad979b11-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22657&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) ran an ad warning Gov. Tom Wolf (D-PA), "You better put a catcher's mask on your face because I'm going to stomp all over your face with golf spikes." Not metaphors.
 
**But the hypocrisy is only part of the story.** The bigger question is whether Democrats genuinely face an existential threat from an opposing party that doesn’t believe the progressive agenda is legitimate, and fights dirty to stop it. The answer to that question is yes.          
               
- Republicans describe progressive protesters as the “[mob](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/politics/Republican-Congress-Democrats-Ahead-of-Election-497222451.html?h_sid=6fad979b11-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22657&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive)” and conservative protesters as the beating heart of real America.          
               
- Republicans are holding on to minority rule for dear life, particularly through racial gerrymandering and voter suppression. Just this week, Georgia’s Republican Secretary of State, [Brian Kemp, purged the voter roles](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/10/12/georgias-gop-gubernatorial-candidate-brian-kemp-sued-over-claims-of-suppressing-53000-minority-voters/?h_sid=6fad979b11-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.bff5ff06e4b7&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22657&amp;noredirect=on) and froze over 50,000, predominantly black voter registrations to steal the Georgia governor’s race for his party’s candidate—himself.          
               
- Republicans are single-mindedly [stacking the courts with right-wing judges](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/11/senate-democrats-judges-895168?h_sid=6fad979b11-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22657&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) who will never face voters, but who believe nearly all major progressive legislation and regulation is unconstitutional.          
               
**Viewed in this broader context, it’s completely obvious that Democrats have to fight** like their party, their agenda, their supporters, and the country depends on it, without placing a premium on civility. Because they all, in fact, depend on it.

**The Turkish government says it has audio and video evidence supporting the conclusion that Saudis murdered [Jamal Khashoggi](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/12/middleeast/khashoggi-saudi-turkey-recordings-intl/index.html?h_sid=6fad979b11-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22657&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) inside the their consulate in Istanbul.** Khashoggi, a journalist who was a vocal critic of the Saudi government, was a legal resident of the U.S. and *Washington Post* columnist, yet [President Trump](https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1050419885891829760) is refusing to sanction the individuals responsible for Khashoggi’s murder and downplaying the seriousness of the crime by noting Khashoggi wasn’t a citizen.             
               
**Civil rights groups are [suing Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/10/12/georgias-gop-gubernatorial-candidate-brian-kemp-sued-over-claims-of-suppressing-53000-minority-voters/?h_sid=6fad979b11-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.bff5ff06e4b7&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22657) for freezing voter registrations of 50,000 overwhelmingly black residents,** to stack the odds in his own campaign for governor against Stacey Abrams, who would be the first, black, female governor in U.S. history. Good.             
               
**[Tropical Storm Michael](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/us/hurricane-michael-live-updates-florida.html?h_sid=6fad979b11-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22657&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) is exiting the continental U.S. and making its way into the Atlantic Ocean after killing 16 people,** leaving at least 1.27 million without power, and destroying the town of Mexico Beach, FL.             
               
**A Turkish court ordered the release of [Andrew Brunson](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/world/europe/turkey-us-pastor-andrew-brunson.html?h_sid=6fad979b11-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22657&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), an American pastor who has been imprisoned in Turkey for the past two years.** Brunson had previously been sentenced to over three years in prison in the aftermath of the failed coup there in 2016, after which he was charged with espionage and aiding terrorists. The Trump administration has leaned heavily on Turkey to release him.              
               
**EPA officials have [disbanded a panel of experts on air pollution](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/climate/epa-disbands-pollution-science-panel.html?h_sid=6fad979b11-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22657&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) that helps the agency determine safe levels of pollution to breathe,** eliminating one obstacle to lowering existing air quality standards. Basically, these people are going to allow more pollutants into the air to benefit the industries they used to work for and will surely return to once their stints in government are over. They don’t care if your kid has asthma.             
               
**Stephen Elliott, a man named on the [Shitty Media Men list](https://jezebel.com/shitty-media-man-sues-creator-of-shitty-media-men-list-1829694376?h_sid=6fad979b11-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=2018-10-12&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=theroot_newsletter)—which circulated among women in media seeking to warn one another about abusive men, before it leaked**—is suing the list’s creator, Moira Donegan, for $1.5 million in damages because his name appeared on the list.

**Under one scenario, the government would detain asylum-seeking families together for 20 days, then force parents to choose** whether to stay in family detention with their children for as long as their immigration proceedings take, or let their kids be taken into government shelters, where other relatives can seek custody.

**The Saudi government is [reportedly prepared to admit](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/15/middleeast/saudi-khashoggi-death-turkey/index.html?h_sid=aab9221ab2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22708&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) that *Washington Post* columnist Jamal Khashoggi**—the Saudi citizen and U.S. resident who disappeared into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last week and never emerged—died in its custody under interrogation as part of a botched effort to abduct him and return him to Saudi Arabia. In other words, Saudi officials murdered Khashoggi, as has been widely suspected for days.          
               
**Unfortunately, it’s unclear whether Trump will accept the confession, or impose any punishment on the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,** or the individuals responsible for Khashoggi’s murder, because he has a corrupt relationship with the Saudi government.           
               
**[Speaking to reporters at the White House](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/15/politics/trump-saudi-king-tweet/index.html?h_sid=aab9221ab2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22708&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) on Monday morning, Trump touted the “very strong” denial he received from Saudi King Salman,** and posited that “rogue killers” might have murdered Khashoggi.          
               
**The question is why, and whether his reluctance to accept the truth of the matter is going to create a global crisis.**          
               
**Trump has claimed he would [impose punishment](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/13/middleeast/khashoggi-saudi-turkey-investigation-intl/index.html?h_sid=aab9221ab2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22708&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) on Saudi Arabia, short of canceling U.S. arm sales to the kingdom,** if it turns out the Saudis did in fact kill Khashoggi. But it’s entirely possible that Trump, who has boasted about Saudi investment in his personal business, has even more corrupt motives for letting the Saudi government get away with murdering a U.S.-based journalist.          
               
**Trump’s involvement in this charade is reminiscent of his ongoing participation in the Russian government coverup of the crimes it committed during the 2016 election.** He is siding with the Saudi government over the growing consensus of his own government, just as he [publicly accepts Vladimir Putin’s denial](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/07/16/vladimir-putin-denies-meddling-2016-presidential-election/788219002/?h_sid=aab9221ab2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22708&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) that Russia interfered in the 2016 election—despite knowing full well that Russia interfered, and that his [campaign happily accepted the help](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/11/17438386/trump-russia-collusion?h_sid=aab9221ab2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22708&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive). He is acting equally compromised now, with equally disastrous consequences.          
               
**According to CNN, the Saudis will issue a report that says [Khashoggi’s death “was the result of an interrogation that went wrong](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/15/middleeast/saudi-khashoggi-death-turkey/index.html?h_sid=aab9221ab2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22708&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive),** one that was intended to lead to his abduction from Turkey,” and that it may “conclude that the operation was carried out without clearance and transparency and that those involved will be held responsible.”          
               
**If this reporting is correct, Trump may decide to let the Saudi’s off the hook anyhow,** creating a horrifying precedent that will endanger exiled dissidents all over the world.

**[Sen. Elizabeth Warren](https://twitter.com/elizabethforma/status/1051783184390664192) (D-MA) issued the results of a DNA test that confirms her Native American ancestry—a response to years of Republican taunting, including by President Trump, who routinely refers to her as “Pocahontas.”** At a July rally, [Trump offered $1 million](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/15/politics/donald-trump-elizabeth-warren-dna-1-million/index.html?h_sid=aab9221ab2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22708&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) to a charity of Warren’s choice if she took a DNA test confirming she was “an Indian”—he now says he will only make the donation if he [can administer the test himself](https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1051943541721759744).

**Patrick Monahan on Twitter: "[Tarbuci’s, my favorite local spot](https://twitter.com/pattymo/status/1051247763005030400)"**I was listening to the 538 politics podcast this morning, and they discussed using PSA appearances as a factor in predicting likely 2020 candidates. Do you think that Crooked will play a role in determining who wins the 2020 Presidential primaries? Do you think that's a role the company has contemplated sufficiently to deal with that moral responsibility?I'm in Canada, and having a heck of a time finding it. The YouTube video is geoblocked. I subscribe to CraveTV, the Canadian streaming service that includes HBO content, and it's not there. I've even looked for torrents and illegal streams (sorry guys), with no luck. I realize I could use a VPN to watch the first episode on YouTube, but that won't help with the other three episodes. Are we expats just out of luck?I’m getting antsy I have been missing the newsletter a lot lately. I don't keep my phone near me at the end of the day, mostly so I don't go crazy any faster than necessary. That said, is there a way to forward email newsletters to Kindle? Or more specifically THIS newsletter. Any help would be great!In episode 2, something that really shocked me, and the podcast doesn’t really try to explain, is how instantly the tea party movement sprang up after Obama’s election, and how savage they were from the beginning. Were the republicans planning this, knowing they’d be in opposition? It seems outlandish to simply blame it on a bad economy and people defaulting to blaming the government. 

And the other thing is how many people thought he was a communist bent on eroding all freedoms. How do you compete with something like that? How do you govern a country where so many people have views like that, let alone govern it progressively? But that’s a whole other thing I suppose

This got a bit long, so I guess the question is, why on earth did the Tea party movement become so strong, so quickly?

The second is, in what way can people on both sides in America agree that immigration is ‘broken’? What is wrong with the system that parties can agree on, and by extension, what is a fix that they can both agree on? People talked a lot about this idea in episode 7 as a way forward for Democrats, but I’m having a hard time picturing it.

**The Long Con**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The GOP’s real agenda for the next two years is to take health-care benefits and Social Security payments away from tens of millions of Americans** to pay for trillions of dollars in tax cuts that mostly went to big corporations and the ultra wealthy.          
               
**Don’t believe us? Believe Senate Majority Leader [Mitch McConnell](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-16/mcconnell-blames-entitlements-not-gop-for-rising-deficits?h_sid=1113e8fb0e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22736&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive).**           
               
**In a Tuesday interview with *Bloomberg*, one day after the White House reported that the annual deficit had soared to $779 million,** McConnell proposed reducing the deficit with “entitlement changes.” Based on past GOP statements and proposed budgets, that means big cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, Affordable Care Act subsidies, and Social Security.          
               
**Here’s the background: President Obama handed Donald Trump and the GOP Congress a healthy, growing economy with low, sustainable budget deficits.** Republicans have increased spending somewhat, but their main policy legacy is the [Trump tax cut](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/16/657790901/federal-deficit-jumps-17-percent-as-tax-cuts-eat-into-government-revenue?h_sid=1113e8fb0e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22736&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), which is expected to add $1.5 trillion to deficits over the coming decade—even though [Republicans promised it would *shrink* the deficit](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-republican-tax-reform-bill-deficit-debt-claims-2017-12?h_sid=1113e8fb0e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22736&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive).           
               
**As [every credible analysis forecast](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fiscal-deficit/republican-tax-cuts-to-fuel-historic-u-s-deficits-cbo-idUSKBN1HG2RW?h_sid=1113e8fb0e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22736&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) at the time, the tax cut did not pay for itself, so now McConnell wants you to pay for it.** He’s not alone. In August, the chairman of the House GOP’s campaign committee [said the same thing](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/20/gop-rep-steve-stivers-urges-medicare-social-security-reform.html?h_sid=1113e8fb0e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;__source=twitter%7Cmain&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22736). So did [Donald Trump’s top economic adviser](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy/trump-adviser-eyes-entitlement-cuts-to-plug-u-s-budget-gaps-idUSKCN1LX254?h_sid=1113e8fb0e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22736&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive). And, of course, [House Speaker Paul Ryan](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/17/14960358/paul-ryan-medicaid-keg?h_sid=1113e8fb0e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22736&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) has been dreaming of this since he was doing keg stands.          
               
**This is exactly how Republicans conceived of their “starve the beast” approach to governing a generation ago**—slashing taxes on the rich while they’re in power then trying to force Democrats to reduce the resulting deficits with cuts to popular programs like Medicare and Social Security. The bait and switch isn’t fooling anyone.          
               
**From Brian:** Leading Democrats seized on McConnell’s confession, and should remind voters about it every day between now and the election. The backlash perfectly explains why Republicans have spent the entire campaign lying about their health-care plans and imaginary mobs and MS-13 and so on. They conceal their true agenda, year in and year out, because the GOP couldn’t survive if they were honest about it. McConnell let the mask slip for a heartbeat and what he revealed was devastating.

**How the Supreme Court gutting the Voting Rights Act led to hundreds of closed polls:**           
               
**In 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act to end things like poll taxes, literacy tests, and other restrictions that were designed to prevent people of color and poor Americans from voting.** It also required areas of the country that historically used these tactics to receive federal approval before making any changes to their election laws. But in 2013 the Supreme Court invalidated key provisions of the act, allowing states to create their own rules again. Since then, the areas that were once required to receive federal approval to make change have closed almost 20 percent more polling places per capita than other areas of the country.

**In an [interview with the *Associated Press* Tuesday](https://www.apnews.com/a28cc17d27524050b37f4d91e087955e?h_sid=242693e0e5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22780&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), Trump vouched for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS),** who is suspected of having ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, but claims he knew nothing about it. Trump parroted that denial. He also said the Saudi government’s plan to investigate itself for the murder will be a “very thorough investigation” that will be completed within a week.

- Trump has boasted of making “[hundreds of millions](https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/1052193155011960834)” selling things to Saudi Arabia.             
               
**From Brian:** If it weren’t already clear, the fact that Trump’s habit of collecting bribes appears to be facilitating grotesque human rights abuses is a great reason for Democrats to get Trump’s tax returns from the IRS as a first order of business if they win the House or Senate.

**King is an unapologetic white nationalist.** This week, King [endorsed a mayoral candidate](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/18/17990718/steve-king-faith-goldy-white-supremacist-canada-iowa-republicans?h_sid=299e150c40-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22885&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) in Toronto, Canada, named Faith Goldy, who lost her job at a far-right Canadian media outlet for collaborating with the *Daily Stormer*, a neo-Nazi website. In [his endorsement](https://twitter.com/SteveKingIA/status/1052390445735706624), he said her greatest virtue is being “Pro Western Civilization.” It’s unusual for a member of the United States Congress to endorse a mayoral candidate in Canada, unless the member of Congress is Steve King, and the mayoral candidate is a neo-Nazi.            
               
**King has been partnering with [Nazi sympathizers](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/us/politics/steve-king-collett-nazi.html?h_sid=299e150c40-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22885&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) and [Islamophobes](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/steve-king-republican-geert-wilders-tweet-wants-everyone-to-look-the-same-a7627216.html?h_sid=299e150c40-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22885&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) and racist political parties abroad for years,** promoting conspiracy theories that include the notion that liberals are secretly committing “[white genocide](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/10/steve-king-endorses-white-supremacist?h_sid=299e150c40-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22885&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive)” by promoting diversity and race-mixing, while discouraging white-ethnic purity. (Seriously.)            
               
**Last year he got in trouble for [tweeting](https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/323606-gop-lawmaker-invokes-far-right-dutch-politician-in-retweet?h_sid=299e150c40-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22885&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), "We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies.”** That sentiment as much as any other underpins his entire, nauseating worldview.             
               
**But House Speaker Paul Ryan [doesn’t care](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/us/politics/steve-king-neonazi-tweet-republicans.html?h_sid=299e150c40-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22885&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive).** King is influential in Iowa politics, so other ambitious Republicans don’t care. In fact, they clamor for his endorsement. In 2016, he [co-chaired Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/ted-cruz-picks-rep-steve-king-campaign-national-co-chair-n491461?h_sid=299e150c40-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22885&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), for example. And because the Republican establishment has decided to accept King, the mainstream media mostly treats him as an oddity rather than a dangerous racist.             
               
**Democrats could and should have made more of an issue of King’s views and alliances in the past.** But as long as Republicans control the House, and Steve King is a member of the GOP conference, Democrats can’t do much more than express outrage over his comments and good standing in the GOP.            
               
**That will all change in November if King is re-elected and Democrats retake the House.** The Constitution provides both the House and the Senate with the power to “expel a Member” with the “Concurrence of two thirds.”            
               
**Democrats aren’t likely to have a two-thirds majority next year, but with a bare majority, they will control the floor and can move to expel King,** which would force Republicans to vote on whether they stand with neo-Nazis and white nationalists or with basic decency.            
               
**From Brian:** Other House Republicans are detestable racists, but King stands alone in aligning himself with eliminationist elements of the global far right—with people who believe the most terrible human-rights abuses are legitimate tools for preserving white-ethnic purity. Expelling a member of Congress is an extraordinary step, and King has demonstrated the kind of extraordinary behavior and rhetoric that makes him the perfect candidate for expulsion. Democrats should make that an early goal of their next majority.

**We’ve said your vote in the midterm elections is important ([Vote Save America](https://votesaveamerica.com/?h_sid=299e150c40-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22885&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), anyone?),** and here’s proof. These ballot measures caught our attention—and you might be voting on them:             
               
- **AWFUL**             
               
**West Virginia: Amendment 1,** *the No Right to Abortion in Constitution Measure*             
               
This amendment would change the state constitution to explicitly state that it doesn't protect a woman's right to have an abortion. In other words, if *Roe V. Wade* were to be overturned, this language would make it constitutionally impossible to allow abortion in West Virginia.

- **IMPORTANT**              
               
**Louisiana: Amendment 2,** *Unanimous Jury Verdict for Felony Trials Amendment*             
               
Right now, Louisiana and Oregon are the only two states that don’t require a unanimous jury to convict someone of a felony. Louisiana only requires that 10 of the 12 jurors believe the person is guilty, meaning someone could get sentenced to prison for life even if 2 jurors believe there is reasonable doubt in the case. This measure would change the law to require unanimous juries to convict people charged with felonies.

**The Saudi Arabian government is now saying that dissident journalist [Jamal Khashoggi died in “a fistfight”](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-45923217?h_sid=778a547f86-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22940&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) that broke out at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul** where he was last seen entering over two weeks ago. This is the first time the Saudi government has admitted that he died. According to a statement released to state-run media, 18 Saudis have been arrested and are being investigated in connection to his death. The statement does not indicate where his body is. Turkish media continues to claim that Khashoggi was interrogated, tortured, and dismembered.            
               
**Don't Vote for Trump**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump has apparently decided that the GOP’s last, best hope of avoiding a midterm wipeout** is for him to barnstorm the country and the media reminding everyone about how he’s a terrible person, and how Republicans up and down the ballot have embraced his terribleness.            
               
**It is ironically the most honest thing about the Republican Party’s midterm campaign strategy,** which is otherwise defined by outrageous lying.             
               
**The immediate effect has been to focus the political media on his most recent outrageous statements:**            
               
- At a rally for GOP Senate candidate Matt Rosendale in Montana on Thursday, Trump celebrated Montana’s Congressman, [Greg Gianforte](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/us/politics/trump-greg-gianforte-montana.html?utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22940&amp;nl=morning-briefing&amp;emc=edit_nn_20181019&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;h_sid=778a547f86-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;nlid=6112595420181019&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;te=1), for physically assaulting a reporter, and encouraged further violence against reporters by insisting that the assault helped Gianforte win his special election last year.             
               
- He accused [Democrats of paying a caravan](https://www.apnews.com/33a20363ee9a414b8d502e2ff74353fb?h_sid=778a547f86-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22940&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) of migrants heading north from Central America to reach the border before the election.            
               
- Earlier this week, he called the adult film actress he once had an affair with, and who sued him for defamation, “[horseface](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/us/politics/trump-women-insults.html?h_sid=778a547f86-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22940&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive).”            
               
- He bragged about how [mocking Dr. Christine Blasey Ford](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-defends-mockery-christine-blasey-ford-says-it-got-kavanaugh-n919986?h_sid=778a547f86-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22940&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), who accused Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her, helped get Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court.             
               
**But at each rally, he’s made the point of saying a vote for [whoever he’s rallying for] [is a vote for him](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/i-am-on-the-ticket-trump-seeks-to-make-the-election-about-him-even-if-some-dont-want-it-to-be/2018/10/17/069406f6-d0bc-11e8-a275-81c671a50422_story.html?h_sid=778a547f86-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22940&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;noredirect=on),** and that’s absolutely fair game:            
               
- Republicans have spent nearly two years helping Trump grift and [cover up corruption](https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-sneak-peek-e5749da8-cdc3-4c8c-8a4c-623a0dabe5f9.html?h_sid=778a547f86-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22940&amp;chunk=0&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive#story0) and [conceal both his tax returns](https://www.vox.com/2018/10/3/17932216/donald-trumps-tax-returns?h_sid=778a547f86-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22940&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) and his administration’s crimes. A vote for them is a vote to let that continue for two further years.

- Republicans, like Trump, fan authoritarianism, then [pretend to believe Democrats whip up mobs](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/16/opinions/trump-calling-democrats-a-mob-berlatsky/index.html?h_sid=778a547f86-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22940&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive). (Trump, by being the least-civil person in politics, has helpfully underscored how full of shit they are about this.)            
               
- When forced to account for their true policy objectives, Republicans, like Trump, have lied egregiously, particularly about the [effect of their corporate, high-income tax cuts](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/19/17989664/deficit-tax-cuts-donald-trump-disaster-relief?h_sid=778a547f86-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22940&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), and their position on protections for people with [pre-existing conditions](https://www.apnews.com/6e1aa41dfaf24320b8dfcc55157f637f?h_sid=778a547f86-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22940&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive). (They oppose the protections, tried to repeal the protections, are suing to get the protections thrown out in court, but have been systemically lying in races across the country to mislead as many people as possible into thinking they support protections for pre-existing conditions.)            
               
**From Brian:** If Trump had decided to completely sit out the midterms, Republicans might actually be better off politically than they are with Trump hogging the spotlight. His polling and theirs seems to improve when he recedes. But whether he was there to say it or not, Republicans have been running a Trump campaign for months and months on their own, and, fortunately, they’re losing.

**Hell No to the Memo**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**There are no shortage of reasons for you to vote on November 6, but here’s one that might fly under the radar:** The Trump administration is considering legal guidance, which, if adopted, would [strip transgender people of civil rights protections](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/us/politics/transgender-trump-administration-sex-definition.html?h_sid=49efa7f6c4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22991&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive).              
               
**President Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services** argues that under Title IX, which seeks to prohibit sex discrimination in education, the [government should define sex](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/trump-administration-considering-narrowing-definition-gender-n922591?h_sid=49efa7f6c4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22991&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) “as male or female based on immutable biological traits identifiable by or before birth.”             
               
**Title IX works by withholding federal funds from institutions that discriminate “on the basis of sex.”** If HHS follows through on this, the courts would have to determine whether the Trump administration wrote transgender people out of Title IX lawfully. The fact that the administration is pushing harder in this direction after the [confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/11/17555974/brett-kavanaugh-anthony-kennedy-supreme-court-transform?h_sid=49efa7f6c4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22991&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) is probably no coincidence. Kavanaugh is more hostile to LGBTQ rights than his predecessor.             
               
**The effect of this would be to [eliminate federal protections for transgender men and women](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/05/13/477896804/obama-administration-to-offer-schools-guidance-on-transgender-bathrooms?h_sid=49efa7f6c4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22991&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive),** reversing strides the Obama administration made to ensure that transgender people aren’t discriminated against at school.              
               
**But that doesn’t mean all hope is lost. Conservatives on the Supreme Court have no control over what laws future Congresses and administrations pass in response.** If the Supreme Court says transgender people aren’t entitled to existing civil rights protections, Congress can amend civil rights laws to explicitly include them.             
               
**That process might take years, and may even require a unified Democratic government before it can be completed,** but it won’t begin unless and until Democrats regain some power in Washington. The midterms are about a lot of things, but stopping this administration from making bigoted policies, or forcing them to reverse such policies, is an important part of the mix.

He, however, does not regret implying that Ted Cruz’s dad killed JFK because he “[doesn’t] regret anything.” This is all super normal.

**Only 56% of U.S. voting-age population cast ballots in the 2016 presidential election.**           
               
Compare that to South Korea (78%) or Mexico (66%). Not smart.           
               
You know what else isn’t smart? Job boards that overwhelm you with tons of the wrong resumes. ZipRecruiter scans thousands of resumes, identifies the right people for your job — then actively invites them to apply. That’s smart.

**Horrendous, right?

The only legal standard currently in place is from 40 years ago, which only requires companies to accommodate pregnant women if they are making the same accommodations for other employees.

- Democrats had nothing to do with the formation of the caravan.              
               
- Democrats do not want the caravaners to cross the southern border undetected and disappear into the United States.

**Republicans want you to believe that the opposite is true for each case.** But just as importantly, they want to create as many diversions as possible, so that the true stakes of the election get lost in the fog. On the fog front, they have been dismayingly successful.              
               
**The real stakes of the midterm are enormous, fascinating, and easy to cover:**              
               
- If Republicans keep the House and Senate, they will take another run at [repealing Obamacare](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mcconnell-gop-may-take-another-shot-at-repealing-obamacare-after-the-midterms/2018/10/17/7a0e7c70-d23c-11e8-8c22-fa2ef74bd6d6_story.html?h_sid=624207dedf-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23050&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) (including its protections for pre-existing conditions), give any money they cut from health care to the rich, and possibly even try to slash [Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-16/mcconnell-blames-entitlements-not-gop-for-rising-deficits?h_sid=624207dedf-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23050&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive).               
               
- If they keep their majorities, they will continue to ignore Trump’s corruption and incompetence, by failing to conduct any meaningful oversight of the executive branch.               
               
- If Republicans keep just the Senate, none of this will happen, but they will continue to reshape the courts for a generation by [confirming almost every judge Trump nominates](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zoetillman/republicans-confirmed-trump-judges-kavanaugh?h_sid=624207dedf-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23050&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive).              
               
- If Democrats win the House, they will share power over the budget with Republicans, and thus can demand that the Trump administration’s priorities better reflect the country’s. They will [protect Special Counsel Robert Mueller](https://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/408822-democrats-efforts-to-protect-mueller-fail-on-the-floor?h_sid=624207dedf-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23050&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), and conduct rigorous investigations of their own. It is very likely that we would finally see Trump’s tax returns. His presidency will be imperiled.               
               
- If Democrats win the Senate as well, Trump will no longer be able to stack the courts with the [Federalist Society](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/us/politics/heritage-foundation-clerks-judges-training.html?h_sid=624207dedf-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23050&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive)’s [favorite right-wingers](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-secrets-of-leonard-leo-the-man-behind-trumps-supreme-court-pick?h_sid=624207dedf-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23050&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive).                
               
- If Democrats win back power in states, the range of potential policy changes [would be vast](https://crooked.com/articles/states-are-destiny/?h_sid=624207dedf-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23050&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), but could include expanded voting rights, gun safety regulations, Medicaid expansion, minimum wage increases, and, eventually, input in the next round of redistricting.               
               
**From Brian:** Instead of foregrounding any of this, most national coverage of the midterms has centered on Trump’s effort to whip up a panic about a caravan of migrants traveling through Mexico, and a fake tax cut plan. It’s all too reminiscent of 2014, when the media chased the [GOP’s contrived panic over Ebola in west Africa](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/04/trump-ebola-tweets/?h_sid=624207dedf-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23050&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), and 2016, when they chased the [GOP’s contrived outrage over Hillary Clinton’s emails](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/republicans-cant-shake-their-preoccupation-clinton-emails?h_sid=624207dedf-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23050&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive).

[President Trump](https://twitter.com/AP/status/1054826352841580551) said the murder was “carried out poorly, and the cover-up was one of the worst in the history of cover-ups,” which is a disgraceful thing to say.

Didn’t think we’d side with Erdoğan on something, but alas, 2018.

When asked today about [using this coded language](https://twitter.com/Acosta/status/1054826879243481088), Trump—avid consumer of cable news—said "I've never heard that theory about being a nationalist."

It seemed very out of place for what South Park normally does.

Comments?So I know the whole "caravan" thing has been in the news for a couple of days (and let's be honest no one will talk about it a week from now), but the only reason I even heard about it was Favreau and Tommy complaining about the media running with it on Twitter. Just 5 minutes ago there was news about 3 different bomb scenarios and Tommy was mentioning the caravan thing being in the news instead.

I dont think they realize how influential they are, and for how much they say that Democrats need to keep on message and not worry about bullshit news, they really do focus on bullshit news a whole lot.

**From Brian:** Let’s hope a silver lining around today’s news is that national political reporters realize they wasted weeks taking disingenuous Republican attacks on supposedly uncivil liberals seriously, and wasted days letting Trump lead them by the nose with transparent lies—including the lie that George Soros paid central American migrants caravanning through Mexico.

**ALABAMA: Amendment 2,** *State Abortion Policy Amendment*             
               
Under current law, the Alabama state constitution does not include any language about abortion. Amendment 2 would make it state policy to “recognize and support the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children, including the right to life.” Basically, this is an attempt by Republicans to eradicate a woman’s constitutionally-protected right to choose in Alabama.

**IDAHO: Proposition 2,** *Medicaid Expansion Initiative*             
               
With Proposition 2, Idaho is putting the question of whether it should expand Medicaid to cover more low-income people to voters. The measure would expand eligibility to those under 65 years old, whose income is 133 percent of the federal poverty level or below and who are not eligible for other state insurance coverage. Hey Idaho, this is a good idea with little cost to the state government.

**The Taylor oil spill began in 2004 and has been leaking an estimated 30,000 gallons of oil a day into Gulf waters.** If the estimates are correct, and the leak continues, the magnitude of the spill will exceed the more intense Deepwater Horizon disaster of 2010.

Only the 1,699 migrants who agreed to register with immigration authorities have been provided aid and allowed to stay in government shelters. These migrants are not being allowed to leave Tapachula and continue north towards the U.S. border until their visas are processed, which could take months. Many caravaners were afraid to register with the Mexican government, suspecting it may be a trap to detain and deport them.

**The Trump Threat Grows**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The unknown terrorist or terrorists who sent pipe bombs to America’s most prominent Trump critics this week had more targets in mind.**                   
               
**On Thursday, authorities intercepted pipe-bomb packages addressed to [Joe Biden and the actor Robert De Niro](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/package-found-robert-de-niro-s-office-nyc-matches-other-n924251?h_sid=74d1420077-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23160&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive)** in Delaware and New York, respectively. Another package, intercepted at a California mail facility, was addressed to [Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA)](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/24/politics/maxine-waters-suspicious-package/index.html?h_sid=74d1420077-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23160&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), who was also one of Wednesday’s targets. None of these devices detonated.                   
               
**After briefly pretending to care about the threatening and potentially deadly incidents on Wednesday, President Trump settled on a [final position](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/24/us/politics/trump-bomb-cnn-obama-clintons.html?utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23160&amp;nl=morning-briefing&amp;emc=edit_nn_20181025&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;h_sid=74d1420077-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;nlid=6112595420181025&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;te=1):** The media is to blame for being too critical of him. “A very big part of the Anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News,” he tweeted. “It has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description. Mainstream Media must clean up its act, FAST!” (CNN was one of Wednesday’s targets, which makes Trump’s tweet a veiled threat to mainstream journalists that they might be killed if they criticize him.)                   
               
**Law enforcement authorities have not named any suspects, but they have plenty of evidence in the form of the unexploded devices.** The culprit also decorated at least one of the devices in a [parody ISIS flag](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/explosive-device-sent-cnn-featured-parody-isis-flag-get-er-n924166?h_sid=74d1420077-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23160&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), which spells out “GET ER DONE” and uses stripper silhouettes to create faux-Arabic script. The “GET ER DONE” ISIS flag has been [a right-wing meme](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Meme-Found-on-Pipe-Bombs-ISIS-Git-Er-Done-Meme-NYC-New-York-City-Brennan-Clintons-Obama-498472241.html?h_sid=74d1420077-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23160&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) for several years.                     
               
**We still don’t know whether the devices were intended to detonate, but failed, or were inert by design**—in other words, we don’t know if this was a botched assassination attempt or a less-violent campaign to terrorize Trump’s critics. The [official Republican spin](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/25/trump-gop-bomb-scare-940825?h_sid=74d1420077-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23160&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) on this episode is that Trump deserves no blame for the mailings, just as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) isn’t to blame for the unhinged Sanders-supporting gunman who shot Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) earlier this year. (Sanders, of course, never relentlessly smeared or attacked Scalise.)                   
               
**But President Trump’s surrogates are telling a different, more pernicious story, to limit political damage to the GOP.** [Donald Trump, Jr.](https://twitter.com/oneunderscore__/status/1055562492926222336), along with the wives of Interior Secretary [Ryan Zinke](https://twitter.com/c_m_dangelo/status/1055533365871427586) and Nevada congressional candidate [Danny Tarkanian](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/amy-tarkanian-shares-conspiracy-theories-mail-bombs?h_sid=74d1420077-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23160&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), have all quietly spread the false message that the bombs were fake, or part of a liberal false flag operation.                    
               
**From Brian:** For all of Trump’s contrived grievances, the mainstream media has actually struggled mightily to describe the timbre of the midterm campaign. Most reporters and pundits, and even some prominent Democrats, have chalked the political climate up to “divisions” or “polarization.” It is an article of faith in the political establishment that Democrats and Republicans are both trying to scare people, and thus the theme of the election is “fear.” This is horseshit. Only one faction in American politics is organizing around incitement and the dehumanization of its opponents. It’s the Republican faction and it’s lead by the president.

Does anybody happen to have a definitive answer on this?

EDIT: All set! Thanks everybody!did anyone get them? I know two other people that requested them too and still haven't heard anything :(If you're not familiar, they do what is, in my opinion, the best interview show going. What makes it special is that it is a remarkably well researched interview conducted while the interviewer and subject(s) eat a series of increasingly hot wings. The effect is that the heat of the wings breaks down the defensive mechanisms of the subjects and their answers are more honest and direct. I think it would be magical.*"What, what happened?

**Mail Bomber Arrested**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Federal law enforcement officers in Florida arrested [Cesar Sayoc](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/10/26/who-is-cesar-altieri-sayoc-what-we-know-about-suspected-mail-bomber-arrested-florida/?h_sid=83df23a332-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.b024034b487f&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23201&amp;noredirect=on), a 56 year-old Trump enthusiast, for mailing over a dozen pipe bombs to President Trump’s most high profile critics,** all of whom have been targets of the president’s smears.                   
               
**The Justice Department has charged Sayoc with [five federal crimes](https://www.thedailybeast.com/doj-mail-bomb-suspect-faces-five-federal-charges?h_sid=83df23a332-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23201&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive),** including threats against former presidents. If convicted on all charges, he faces up to 48 years in prison.                   
               
**Upon Sayoc’s arrest, agents [confiscated his white van](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/26/politics/cesar-sayoc-white-van-stickers/index.html?h_sid=83df23a332-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23201&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), which he had plastered with pro-Trump stickers** and stickers attacking Trump’s political enemies, including Hillary Clinton, Eric Holder, and other mail bomb targets. [Sayoc’s social media accounts](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/mail-bomb-suspect-sayoc-shared-social-media-posts-about-targets?h_sid=83df23a332-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23201&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) included a video of himself wearing a MAGA hat, which he recorded at a 2016 Trump rally.                   
               
**Shortly before the arrest, [Trump dismissed the significance](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1055826295337172993) of these acts of terrorism.** He complained that news coverage of the attempted bombings had depressed Republican voter turnout, and suggested, intentionally or otherwise, that the attacks were a false-flag operation perpetrated by Democrats.                    
               
&gt; **Donald J. Trump on Twitter: "[Republicans are doing so well in early voting, and at the polls, and now this “Bomb” stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows - news not talking politics. Very unfortunate, what is going on. Republicans, go out and vote!](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1055826295337172993)"**                    
               
**The FBI typically briefs the White House in real time amid national security investigations like these,** which suggests Trump knew, or should have known, that the suspect was a supporter of his when he sent that tweet. Speaking at a DOJ press conference Friday afternoon, [FBI Director Chris Wray](https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2018/10/26/suspicious-packages-bombs-not-hoax-devices-wray-fbi-nr-vpx.cnn?h_sid=83df23a332-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23201&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) would not confirm whether he had briefed the White House in advance of the arrest, but noted emphatically, “these are not hoax devices.”                    
               
**After Sayoc was in custody, Trump hosted the [Young Black Leadership Summit](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/26/trump-says-americans-must-unify-after-florida-man-arrested-in-bomb-plot-targeting-democrats.html?h_sid=83df23a332-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23201&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) at the White House,** where he attacked “globalists” and “fake polls” prompting audience members to shout “George Soros”—one of the bomb recipients—“CNN sucks”—another bomb recipient—and “lock ‘em up”—a reference to Hillary Clinton, who was also one of Sayoc’s targets.                    
               
**Between Thursday night and today’s arrest, authorities intercepted [more packages](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/us/politics/trump-bomb-media.html?h_sid=83df23a332-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23201&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive)** addressed to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Kamala Harris (D-CA), and Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer.                    
               
**Trump loyalists who had been recklessly advancing the false flag conspiracy theory reacted in mixed ways.** Some [recanted](https://twitter.com/GeraldoRivera/status/1055871163790958592), others [tried to delete](https://twitter.com/brianbeutler/status/1055884881392271360) evidence of their comments, still more [pivoted](https://twitter.com/tripgabriel/status/1055877896793964544) to a [new conspiracy theory](https://twitter.com/LauraLoomer/status/1055854372389826561), in which Sayoc is a patsy or a crisis actor, and the sticker-covered van is planted evidence. (Seriously.)                    
               
**None of the intercepted devices have detonated,** though Wray cautioned that more devices might still be in circulation.                     
               
**From Brian:** Trump’s tweet suggested he’s deeply frustrated that his efforts to energize Republican voters by portraying Democrats as dangerous were upended by a right-wing bomber targeting Democrats. He will almost certainly do something reckless and gross to get Sayoc out of the news and reporters focusing on his racist incitement once again.                     
               
**What Else**

**President Trump is reportedly [considering an executive order](https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Trump-administration-considers-travel-ban-like-13337662.php?h_sid=83df23a332-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=1185a19585-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_10_26_07_17&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=CNN+Five+Things&amp;utm_term=0_6da287d761-1185a19585-86393421) similar to the Muslim travel ban in order to close the southern border** to incoming migrants from Central America—many of whom are seeking asylum. Trump is desperate to manipulate media into covering "dangerous foreigners" who want to live in America, but an order along these lines would invite a swift legal challenge.

**The Trump administration is admitting that it [failed to include at least fourteen migrant children](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zoetillman/government-found-14-kids-separated-parents-border?h_sid=83df23a332-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23201&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) in its official count of children they separated from their families at the border,** resulting in these children remaining in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services for months. This was realized three months after the court-mandated deadline to reunify these children with their parents.                     
               
**Saudi Arabia has acknowledged for the first time that the murder of dissident journalist [Jamal Khashoggi was premeditated](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-jamal-khashoggi-turkey.html?utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23201&amp;nl=morning-briefing&amp;emc=edit_nn_20181026&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;h_sid=83df23a332-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;nlid=6112595420181026&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;te=1).** Previously, they insisted that Khashoggi left the consulate alive, then said he had been a target of a “rogue” operation, and then said he died in a fistfight inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.

In Star Trek the next generation, episode "Chain of Command",  Madred attempts to break Picard's will by showing 4 lights, and offering Picard freedom if just says that he sees 5 lights.  I've felt that 45 has been doing this to America trying to break our will for democracy, civility and freedom.  I wonder PSA's 4 lights are done in reference to this episode, or just aesthetically pleasing.  {Been listening since the beginning}Today's discussion post will be End on A High Note, inspired by Pod Save America. What news is giving you cause to be optimistic?I am really pissed off about something like tis when it comes from progressives.   
This is the "all lives matter" of political debate. and I hate it when the smart side quotes the republicans on that, as if to excuse Trump's , or McConnell's or Ryan's lies.  


There is a difference between   
D. making a campaign promise and then not living up to it, or even consciously breaking it  
R. lying about actual facts : "We have worked to keep the ACA and pre-existing conditions" or the present "It isn't raining."  


I hate it when someone says "All politicians lie" and everyone around just nods.   


\-----  
I get that there is a feeling of deception when a campaign promise is vague. but rewriting facts Orwell style is not the same, and can't be treated as same. *"Vote blue... bitches!!!"—[Axl Rose](https://twitter.com/axlrose/status/1056736856455372800).

**Divide And Squander**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**On Saturday, Robert Bowers [shot and killed 11 people](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/us/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting.html?utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23286&amp;nl=morning-briefing&amp;emc=edit_nn_20181029&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;h_sid=c8377ad2a5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;nlid=6112595420181029&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;te=1) and injured six at Tree of Life, a synagogue in Pittsburgh, PA.** His motive? Bowers said he “wanted all Jews to die” because they were “committing genocide against his people.” According to the [Anti-Defamation League](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/27/us/jewish-hate-crimes-fbi/index.html?h_sid=c8377ad2a5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23286&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), this massacre is believed to be the worst ever committed against Jewish people on American soil, and officials have [filed hate crime charges](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/27/us/pittsburgh-synagogue-active-shooter/index.html?h_sid=c8377ad2a5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23286&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) against Bowers.                   
               
**Bowers’ vicious attack closed out a week of racial and politically-motivated violence and domestic terrorism around the country:**                   
               
- Over a dozen pipe bombs were sent to Democratic leaders, in one of the largest mass assassination attempts in American history. [Cesar Soyac](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/mailbomb-pittsburgh-shooting-online-hate-real-world?h_sid=c8377ad2a5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=BuzzFeed%2BNews%2B-%2BOctober%2B29%2C%2B2018&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_term=News%2Bconfirmed%2Blist), the man who mailed the pipe bombs, had a online history of extremism and hatred similar to Bowers’.                   
               
- In [Louisville](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/26/us/kentucky-kroger-shooting/index.html?h_sid=c8377ad2a5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23286&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), a white shooter tried first to enter a predominantly black church, and when he was unable to, shot and killed two black people at a local grocery store, later telling an armed patron of the grocery store that “whites don’t shoot whites.”                   
               
**It’s impossible to divorce these acts of violent hatred from the words and actions of our own president and his party.** Bowers claimed that Jews were [helping transport members of migrant caravans](https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting/h_0c180f52c8d032fd47eef570cc5065c2?h_sid=c8377ad2a5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23286&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) from Latin America to the United States. The narrative of a caravan of “violent gang members” and “some Middle Easterners” rapidly approaching the U.S. southern border, paid for by Democrats like Jewish philanthropist George Soros, is one that President Trump and other Republicans have pushed repeatedly in the weeks ahead of the midterm elections.                   
               
**In fact, all of these acts follow weeks of Trump calling Democrats “[evil](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/evil-becomes-trumps-adjective-choice-his-us-opponents?h_sid=c8377ad2a5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23286&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive)” and the media “[the enemy of the people](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/business/media/trump-media-enemy-of-the-people.html?h_sid=c8377ad2a5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23286&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive).”** They also follow a [rise in hate crimes](https://www.naacp.org/latest/naacp-sees-continued-rise-hate-crimes-legacy-trumps-racism/?h_sid=c8377ad2a5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23286&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) and anti-Semitism during Trump’s presidency, during which time he has called the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who marched in Charlottesville “[very fine people](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/trump-defends-white-nationalist-protesters-some-very-fine-people-on-both-sides/537012/?h_sid=c8377ad2a5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23286&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive).” In turn, those groups have [praised Donald Trump](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/david-duke-donald-trump-state-of-the-union-2018-kkk-wihte-supremacist-americans-dreamers-a8186606.html?h_sid=c8377ad2a5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23286&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), believing that he is sympathetic to their cause.                   
               
**Despite all this, Republicans are [vehemently pushing back](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-gop-defiant-amid-allegations-that-incendiary-rhetoric-contributed-to-climate-of-violence/2018/10/28/eecd91f6-dae1-11e8-b732-3c72cbf131f2_story.html?h_sid=c8377ad2a5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.06c19b97314d&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23286&amp;noredirect=on) against the idea that Trump or party leaders have any responsibility to tone down their rhetoric.** If anything, the President has decided to double down on his strategy of fear and division in the last week before the midterm election. And Republican candidates are all too happy to let him do it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The Defense Department is sending 5,200 active duty troops to the U.S. southern border in order to “harden” it against a migrant caravan that’s still hundreds of miles and weeks away from the U.S. border.** [Mexico’s ambassador to the U.S.](https://twitter.com/NPRinskeep/status/1056858924794679296) says the caravan is down to 3,500 people, and many in that group are accepting offers of asylum from Mexico.

The shooting occurred before classes started for the day, and the school was placed on lockdown at the time, but it [remained in session](https://twitter.com/wsoctv/status/1056907980006924288?h_sid=c8377ad2a5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23286&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) even though a student was shot and killed in front of many others.

New indications suggest this Pivot (back) To Race Baiting^TM may have backfired.                   
               
**Trump claimed in an interview with *Axios* this week that he will soon issue an executive order [halting birthright citizenship](https://theintercept.com/2018/10/30/axios-hbo-trump-birthright-citizenship/?h_sid=d660eec0c4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23368&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive)**—the constitutional guarantee of citizenship to the U.S.-born children of non-citizens.                   
               
**The initial coverage of Trump’s comments, in Axios and elsewhere, was wildly irresponsible.** It uncritically repeated Trump’s false claim that other countries don’t offer birthright citizenship ([dozens of democracies do](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/30/us/politics/trump-birthright-citizenship.html?h_sid=d660eec0c4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23368&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive)) and failed to note that [constitutional rights](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/30/us/politics/birthright-citizenship-executive-order-trump.html?utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23368&amp;nl=evening-briefing&amp;emc=edit_ne_20181030&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;h_sid=d660eec0c4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;nlid=6112595420181030&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;te=1) can’t be undone by executive order.

**Relatedly, amid [new polling](https://twitter.com/ChangePolls/status/1057121115879833600) that shows Rep. Steve King (R-IA)—the Nazi-sympathizing Iowa congressman—losing ground** to his Democratic challenger, J.D. Scholten, the chairman of the House Republican election committee [denounced King](https://twitter.com/RepSteveStivers/status/1057327397685653510), calling his “recent comments, actions, and retweets” “completely inappropriate,” and adding, “I strongly condemn this behavior.”                    
               
**From Brian:** [Steve King](https://crooked.com/articles/expel-steve-king-from-congress/?h_sid=d660eec0c4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23368&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) has been palling around with European fascists and retweeting neo-Nazis and making wildly bigoted comments since long before Trump became president. Reporters have been asking GOP leaders like Strivers and Ryan if they’d condemn King’s antics, to no avail, for years. To the contrary, King has been a Republican validator ahead of Iowa caucuses in multiple presidential election cycles. He was even Ted Cruz’s 2016 national campaign co-chairman! Now, a week before the election, they want distance themselves from him. Ryan, likewise, would not be shutting down Trump’s birthright talk outright unless he saw a huge backlash to Trump’s bigotry building.                    
               
**The conventional wisdom among political analysts is that Trump ratcheted up racist incitement in the past few weeks as a savvy ploy to juice Republican turnout.** Take one step back from it, though, and it looks more like flailing desperation. At this point in 2016, when polling showed victory within reach, Trump actually receded from the race, and dialed down his incendiary nonsense. Nothing can be taken for granted, but we’re seeing in these closing days how Trump acts when he senses defeat.                    
               
**Listen:** J.D. Scholten, Rep. Steve King's Democratic challenger, is on Monday’s [*Pod Save America*](https://crooked.com/podcast/from-charlottesville-to-pittsburgh/?h_sid=d660eec0c4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23368&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) →                    
               
**What Else**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump visited Pittsburgh in the aftermath of the massacre at Tree of Life synagogue,** despite widespread requests for him to steer clear of the city, at least until the dead have been buried. Upon his arrival scores of residents [protested](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/10/30/despite-calls-stay-away-trump-heads-pittsburgh-after-synagogue-massacre/?h_sid=d660eec0c4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23368&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;noredirect=on) him, his divisive politics, and his call for arming synagogues. Trump [reportedly](https://twitter.com/howardfineman/status/1057321489828065283) lied to congressional leaders of both parties in an attempt to convince them to join him on his trip, but all of them declined his invitation.                    
               
**Notorious pro-Trump grifter Jacob Wohl got [caught organizing a fraudulent scheme](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/10/special-counsel-refers-scheme-targeting-mueller-to-fbi/574411/?h_sid=d660eec0c4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=2018-10-30T17%3A14%3A35&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=atlantic-politics-and-policy&amp;utm_content=edit-promo&amp;utm_source=twitter) to falsely accuse Special Counsel Robert Mueller of sexual assault.** The plan involved approaching [multiple women](https://twitter.com/NatashaBertrand/status/1057365295323586562) who have since told reporters they were offered money to publicly accuse Mueller of misconduct. The problem (other than the obvious grossness): Mueller got wind of the plot and immediately referred it to the Justice Department for criminal investigation, because it may constitute wire fraud and obstruction of justice. Couldn’t have happened to a more deserving lowlife. Note to others: Trying to do crimes against the most experienced cop in America is a bad idea, don’t do it.                    
               
**Speaking of Mueller, his team questioned former Trump campaign chair [Steve Bannon](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mueller-probes-roger-stones-interactions-with-trump-campaign-and-timing-of-wikileaks-release-of-podesta-emails/2018/10/30/33052472-db89-11e8-85df-7a6b4d25cfbb_story.html?h_sid=d660eec0c4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.878944878556&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23368) again, this time about Roger Stone’s communications** with the Trump campaign about his foreknowledge that Wikileaks would publish stolen Democratic emails.                    
               
**Federal prosecutors are seeking the [death penalty](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/blakemontgomery/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-death-penalty?h_sid=d660eec0c4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=BuzzFeed+News+-+October+30%2C+2018&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_term=News+confirmed+list) against Robert Bowers,** the anti-semite who murdered 11 worshipers in a Pittsburgh synagogue this weekend.                    
               
**The Interior Department’s internal watchdog just referred Interior Secretary [Ryan Zinke](https://www.washingtonpost.com/energy-environment/2018/10/30/zinkes-own-agency-watchdog-just-referred-him-justice-department/?h_sid=d660eec0c4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23368&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) to the Department of Justice** for potential criminal prosecution. Zinke has been the subject of [15 federal investigations](https://www.citizensforethics.org/a-guide-to-the-14-federal-investigations-into-ryan-zinke/?h_sid=d660eec0c4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23368&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) since he was confirmed in March 2017. Only one more until he beats former EPA chief Scott Pruitt. C’mon buddy, almost there!                    
               
**According to federal authorities, the man who mailed over a dozen pipe bombs to high-profile Trump critics around the country last week had a [list of 100 possible targets](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/us/cnn-suspicious-package-bomb.html?utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23368&amp;nl=morning-briefing&amp;emc=edit_nn_20181030&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;h_sid=d660eec0c4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;nlid=6112595420181030&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;te=1).**                    
               
**Though Trump has repeatedly claimed that the US-Saudi arms deal will create 500,000 jobs and isn’t worth jeopardizing over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi,** the deal would actually [only create a few hundred new jobs](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-saudi-arms-jobs-exclusive/exclusive-defence-firms-see-only-hundreds-of-new-u-s-jobs-from-saudi-mega-deal-idUKKCN1N40D6?h_sid=d660eec0c4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23368&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) in addition to maintaining 18,000 jobs that already exist. It’s almost as if Trump has a [corrupt ulterior motive](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-saudi-arabia-financial-interests-ties-hotel-bookings-sales-2018-10?h_sid=d660eec0c4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_23368&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) for helping the Saudi government cover up its crime.                    
               
**Engineers at Google have [organized a walkout to protest](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/googles-female-engineers-walkout-sexual-harassment?h_sid=d660eec0c4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=BuzzFeed+News+-+October+30%2C+2018&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_term=News+confirmed+list) the company’s payouts to and protection of high-level male employees** who engaged in sexual misconduct with co-workers.

Just a quick question on Student Tickets for anyone who has bought them: The site says that the tickets are first come, first served at the box office. Are they only on sale the day of the show or can I buy them in person ahead of time?

Thanks!I have two tickets in Orchestra Row G to the Oakland Show of Pod Tours America that I can't use. Will sell them individually too! Message me for info.I have a pair of extra tickets for the 12/4 Oakland show (I'm going with a friend but bought 4 and wasn't able to find another 2 people to come with). They're in the Orchestra Terrace(?) in row W, so pretty good seats. I'm just asking for face value ($60). Message me if you're interested!The tour is coming to where I live. If I go, I would absolutely want to go to both Pod Tours America, and Lovett or Leave It. However, tickets for both would be near $100 total, which is a good amount of money for me.

Could someone who's been to a show describe what it's like? Is it longer or is there more than what's on the podcasts? I'm just wondering if there's more that makes it worth going to besides just the idea of seeing everyone in person.Please direct all your discussion for the new tour dates here!

Has anyone gotten a Pod Save / Friend Of The Pod sweatshirt from the crooked site yet? I'm digging the [unisex sweatshirts](https://store.crooked.com/collections/guys/products/pod-save-america-sweatshirt) but I'm not sure if the small is like, a guys small, or what. 
What's the scale for sizing on these? 
I'm a girl but I want my wrists to be covered, feel me? 
THANKS FRIENDS - I decided to try Overcast as a replacement for Apple’s Podcasts app. It seemed to be working well until I tried to download the new Pod Save the World episode. The most recent show available through Overcast is from October 4, 2017! 

Deleted the app and reinstalled. Same issue. Anyone else having this problem? Is the pod available through any other apps besides Apple’s?Accidentally booked a vacation the same week and won’t be in town. Let me know if you’re interested!It’s been a long and weird year for all of us, I presume. I’ve stepped back from discussing content of the Pods with the subreddit and mainly focusing on making this subreddit a more welcoming space for lively and civil discussions instead. Please comment in this thread for ideas on how we can improve this sub!

MORE TO COME:

* I am trying to get that sponsored list updated so I can post it either in the side bar or make a page or post, so stay tuned for that.
* If anyone can help me setup an auto-moderator or knows someone who can help, also please let me know!

Thank you guys so much for helping me figure out this sub as this is the first subreddit I’ve ever moderated! Happy holidays (WAR ON CHRISTMAS ISNT FINISHED YET) and hope everyone has a happy new year (with hopefully a live show or two to look forward to!)I'd really like to rehear those episodes. I know they are spread out over several of the different podcast. So general dates would work.Hey all, this is super silly and not really important but I'd like to know how to make this work!

I got an Echo for Christmas and its dope. One feature I love is I can tell it "Alexa, play X podcast." It works for the other Crooked Media pods but not Lovett or Leave It, presumably because it thinks I'm saying "Love It or Leave It"

I'm totally new to Echo and this kind of smart device in general (other than smartphones lol) - anyone know of  some way I can make it play that specific podcast when I say the name?I have been listening to Pod Save America sense it was Keeping it 1600.  I have also listened to a few of the other pods, but mostly PSA. It is awesome and much more fair to conservative viewpoints than Hannity or his ilk are to liberal viewpoints.

However, I am a middle of the road guy, and I hold some conservative viewpoints.  I really like to hear real, passionate arguments from both sides of the spectrum that don't pander or conflate/misrepresent arguments from the other side. PSA does great for the left of center and liberal viewpoints, and I would like to see if they could do the same for the right of center and conservative viewpoints. 

Only two other pod's I know of come close to this, but they don't really do a great job.  Dan Carlin's Common Sense is generally a conservative podcast, but it is much more broad in its topics and more libertarian than conservative.  Radio Free California does ok at presenting conservative viewpoints, but it does so in a dishonest way sometimes.

Maybe Tim Miller can fill this role? Can you actually have a conservative leaning podcast in the Crooked lineup without it becoming a podcast about a conservative apologist?Does anyone know of this episode or if it was even aired?? I want to listen to this so bad.I have trouble listening to the pods lately because I feel like often the guys can be so overwhelmingly similar to those they protest. I agree with their stance on most things, but idk why they don’t point out problems within the Democratic or progressive party too, especially on Twitter. Rather than acknowledge our own shortcomings it seems they often just push it off as “well we’re not in control now” I mean would love someone to show me otherwise because I typically enjoy the shows but I’m getting frustrated. Also the fact that they won’t say something about louis Farrakhan is pissing me off as a Jewish progressive. Most guilty of this is Favreau. Every time it comes up and he mentions “when Pelosi has the gavel” I just cringe. He just said it on the Thursday pod. 

The Democratic Party desperately needs new leadership. Why would we give it to Pelosi and Schumer? They’ve had their chance and the party has suffered miserable losses up and down the ballot thanks in part to their leadership and the GOP’s ability to use them as boosters for their own campaigns.  

I don’t see any good that would come out of handing them the titles of speaker/majority leader if Dems take back congress. The guys are generally not critical enough of the party, but this particular point especially is a blind spot of theirs. No episode up yet and couldn't find anything on their twitters. Am I missing something?

-----------------------------------------------------------
Former Trump aide [Sam Nunberg](https://www.vox.com/2018/3/5/17081954/sam-nunberg-mueller-trump-interview?h_sid=83537214) appeared on every cable news show in the land today to let America know he will not be complying with a [subpoena](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/special-counsel-wants-documents-trump-numerous-campaign-associates-n853386) from Special Counsel Robert Mueller to produce all of his communications with Trumpland. Why? Because it would take him [“80 hours”](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/03/what-is-sam-nunberg-doing/554906/?h_sid=83537214) to pull together the emails, and he believes Mueller is setting him up for a perjury case against his mentor [Roger Stone](https://twitter.com/TheBeatWithAri/status/970797985985630209?h_sid=83537214).                         
                               
[Nunberg](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/former-trump-aide-sam-nunberg-called-before-grand-jury-says-he-will-refuse-to-go/2018/03/05/24c8b86a-20a9-11e8-badd-7c9f29a55815_story.html?h_sid=83537214&amp;utm_term=.5b39bd847553) made it clear in his bizarre media tour that he a) is naming names and b) needs a good hug. Here are his thoughts on:                   
                    
• **Collusion:** *“[Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/03/05/ex-trump-aide-trump-may-very-well-have-done-something-during-the-election-with-the-russians/?h_sid=83537214&amp;utm_term=.eb03adf80a87) may have very well done something during the election with the Russians.”* That’s a pretty big admission!                         
                                   
• **Don Jr.’s Trump Tower meeting with Russians:** *“The [Russians](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/ex-aide-won-t-comply-subpoena-says-trump-may-have-n853771) offered us something and we thought they had something. And that was it. I don't know why he went around trying to hide it."* Also a big admission!                      
                        
• **Former Trump adviser/FBI surveillance subject Carter Page:** *"I believe [Carter Page](https://twitter.com/ByronTau/status/970769557488111616?h_sid=83537214&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) was colluding with the Russians… Carter Page is a weird dude."* Sam, don’t stop. You’re killing it.                   
                            
• **His refusal to comply:** *“I think it would be funny if they [arrested](https://twitter.com/Ed_Demaria/status/970748156752392192?h_sid=83537214) me.” But maybe not "ha ha" funny. He later [reversed himself](https://www.axios.com/nunberg-now-says-hell-cooperate-with-investigators-1520300941-e164aac2-e662-4684-a8c2-8123e25e77ce.html?h_sid=83537214) to say he'll probably cooperate with Mueller now.*
 
• **What will come of this shitshow:** *“I’m not going to go to jail.... [Mueller](https://www.axios.com/nunberg-interview-a856e24e-5c7c-4daf-8376-ef5a6f619f36.html?h_sid=83537214&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiospm&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;stream=top-stories&amp;utm_source=newsletter) isn’t going to do anything.” Ah, the seldom seen “I dare you” legal strategy. Very cool.*                                            
                                   
• **Who’s at fault:** *“[Donald Trump](https://www.mediaite.com/tv/sam-nunberg-is-not-done-claims-lewandowski-hope-hicks-had-affair-trumps-an-idiot/?h_sid=83537214) caused this, because he’s an IDIOT.”* No argument there!                                

                                                      
**Trade War—What's It Good For?!**
-------------------------------------------------------------------
**“We’re not backing down” from a [trade war](https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/970720240454832128?h_sid=83537214), says President Trump**, who’s sticking by his decision to impose tariffs on all imported steel and aluminum, without exemptions for U.S. allies. But Trump is pretty isolated. Even House Speaker [Paul Ryan](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/ryan-splits-with-trump-as-gop-lawmakers-move-to-block-planned-tariffs/2018/03/05/cbb5c786-2094-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html) is “urging the White House not to advance with this plan.” New reports say that while tariffs will create some jobs in these sectors, they will cost 179,000 American jobs.                                                      
                                            
**The European Union may retaliate with [tariffs](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-europe/europe-targets-u-s-bourbon-bikes-blue-jeans-for-trade-riposte-idUSKCN1GE1F9?h_sid=83537214&amp;il=0) of their own** on American-made Harley Davidson motorcycles, bourbon, and jeans—which happen to hit the home states of Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, and Nancy Pelosi. Mr. Art of the Deal then threatened further escalation on Twitter, saying he would “simply apply a tax on their cars, which freely pour into the U.S…”                           
                                                                 
**From Brian Beutler:** What do President Trump’s proposed tariffs have to do with Russia? Possibly nothing! Trump has been anti-trade for a long time. He’s actually consistent on it. Protectionism, racism, and authoritarianism—he’s always been a fan.                                       
                                            
**But what’s also true is that Russia wants to divide the U.S. and Europe**, and a trade war would do just that. And because Trump hasn’t revealed almost anything about his finances, we have no idea whether Trump is imposing tariffs for legitimate reasons or corrupt ones (same goes for imposing sanctions on Russia, or refusing to criticize Putin). If we don’t know whether someone like Putin has leverage over Trump, we can’t trust decisions our government makes.

**DACA Deadline Comes and Goes**
-----------------------------------------------------
**Today is the [arbitrary deadline](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dreamers-deferred-congress-lets-daca-deadline-pass/story?h_sid=83537214&amp;id=53464924) Trump set to end the DACA renewal process** for young immigrants, but recent court decisions that have stopped the termination of the program have made this deadline relatively meaningless. The uncertainty surrounding protections for Dreamers has led to another push for a short-term extension. A government spending bill, due by March 23, could be a way to grant some Dreamers a temporary reprieve.                         
                                 
**Under The Radar**
----------------------------------------------------------
The [teachers strike](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/3/17074824/west-virginia-teachers-strike-justice-union?h_sid=83537214) in West Virginia was supposed to end last Wednesday, when the governor agreed to increase teachers’ pay by five percent if state lawmakers approved the bill. But the state's 680 public schools will stay closed through tomorrow because the state Senate refused to approve the increase, passing a four percent hike instead.                                                        
                                       
In [Oklahoma](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-west-virginia-education/oklahoma-teachers-might-follow-west-virginia-in-strike-walk-outs-idUSKBN1GH0KH?h_sid=83537214), educators may be gearing up for similar strikes. That state has not given educators a raise in more than a decade.                       
                          
**What Else**
--------------------------------------------------------------
**After the election, Trump’s personal lawyer/goon [Michael Cohen](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-lawyers-payment-to-porn-star-was-reported-as-suspicious-by-bank-1520273701?h_sid=83537214) complained to friends that his $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels hadn’t been reimbursed.** Cohen also revealed he had missed two prior deadlines to pay her because he wasn’t able to reach Trump in the final days of the campaign. If Trump ordered Cohen to pay Daniels, and promised to reimburse him, both of these bozos might be in (even more?) trouble with the law.                                 
                                   
**Mississippi Senator [Thad Cochran](https://twitter.com/ABCPolitics/status/970776860090134528?h_sid=83537214) (R-MS) is resigning on April 1,** for health reasons. Mitch McConnell and President Trump have pushed the state’s GOP governor to consider appointing himself to fill the seat.                     
                                          
**The State Department has spent [NONE](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/04/world/europe/state-department-russia-global-engagement-center.html?h_sid=83537214) of the $120 million allocated to “counter foreign efforts to meddle in elections or sow distrust in democracy”** since the 2016 election. On top of that, none of the 23 analysts employed by State’s Global Engagement Center speak Russian. Fantastic!                                                                  
                                                
**Look No Further than the Crooked Media**
------------------------------------------------------------
***Tim Miller's latest for Crooked.com: Shun the Trumpers.* “Liberals have the power to shame future politicians and operatives out of race-baiting and shameless lying by writing Trumpers out of polite society. It’s time you started using it.”**
[Read](https://crooked.com/article/shun-trumpers/?h_sid=83537214) →                                               
                                     
**The New Dumbest Thing I Have Ever Heard**
---------------------------------------------------------
**Here’s an Academy Award voter’s thoughts on the film “Get Out,”** which won an Oscar for best original screenplay:               
                                         
“It’s a good B-movie …[b]ut what bothered me afterwards was that, instead of focusing on the fact that this was an entertaining little horror movie that made quite a bit of money, they started trying to suggest it had deeper meaning than it does—and, as far as I’m concerned, they played the race card, and that really turned me off.”                                                        
                                               
Two words: Keep. It.                                      
                               
**Long Read**
------------------------------------------------------------------
Jane Meyer’s New Yorker profile of [Christopher Steele](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/12/christopher-steele-the-man-behind-the-trump-dossier?h_sid=83537214), “the man behind the Trump dossier,” is full of new information. For example, Steele authored another unseen memo that alleges the Kremlin may have “intervened to block Trump’s initial choice for Secretary of State, Mitt Romney…[who in 2012] was notably hawkish on Russia, calling it the single greatest threat to the U.S.”                      
                                          
An important subtext of Mayer’s piece: basically everything Steele did that Republicans have tried to characterize as evidence of partisanship is standard operating procedure for him.                       
                         
**Enjoy**
------------------------------------------------------------
No one in D.C. wants to [date conservatives](https://www.washingtonian.com/2018/03/05/why-its-hard-for-conservatives-to-date-in-dc-right-now/), or how Trump cucked the entire GOP singles scene. Swipe right.On yesterdays episode they discussed SA's congress voting to move forward on taking away the farmlands from white South Africans. In my view, advocated for it in talking only of the income inequality seen in South Africa, and not about the potential consequences of such an action, as exhibited in Zimbabwe years ago. And, they left out the part about the congress saying that this wasn't "yet" a call for genocide.

Make no mistake, this action meets the United Nation's standards for ethnic cleansing as seen [here](http://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/ethnic-cleansing.html)

&gt;The Commission of Experts also stated that the coercive practices used to remove the civilian population can include: murder, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, extrajudicial executions, rape and sexual assaults, severe physical injury to civilians, confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas, **forcible removal**, **displacement and deportation of civilian population**, deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas, use of civilians as human shields, **destruction of property**,** robbery of personal property**, attacks on hospitals, medical personnel, and locations with the Red Cross/Red Crescent emblem, among others.

I am aware of the difficult past the nation of South Africa has. We have one here as well. I am also sympathetic to the plight of black south Africans.  But the sins of the father cannot be past down to the sins of the son. What foreign investments can SA expect if property rights are insecure? Why would non-land owning whites be inclined to stay in SA and continue to the country when their livelihood is can be taken away from them at the whim of congress? What global fallibility can SA expect when it persecutes a minority group, particularly a powerful one with close ties to the west? 

I don't see how this does more harm than good for black south africans, and I resent crooked media for not calling this what it is, stupid and racist. **North Korea Says Something... Positive?**
------------------------------------------------------------
**North Korea “clearly stated it’s willingness to [denuclearize](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/world/asia/north-korea-south-nuclear-weapons.html?h_sid=83836082)”** and to hold negotiations with the United States, according to South Korean envoys who spoke to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. They say the North could give up nuclear weapons if they feel the “military threat” to their country from the U.S. was eliminated, and its security was guaranteed. South and North Korean leaders also agreed to meet next month.                                  
                                            
**The U.S. has demanded that North Korea show a willingness to give up nuclear weapons** as a precondition for any talks with the regime. Trump also [announced](https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/23/politics/donald-trump-north-korea-sanctions/index.html?h_sid=83836082) a new round of sanctions against North Korea’s shipping and trade industries last month to create additional pressure.                                   
                                                        
**Trump met the news of “possible progress” by [tweeting](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/971025582061424640)** “may be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!”                                                        
                                                  
**From Tommy Vietor:** To quote a tired Twitter joke, BIG IF TRUE. The announcement comes at the end of a two-day summit in Pyongyang that was the first meeting between Kim and South Korean officials since Kim took power. Veteran North Korea negotiators have often seen North Korea make promises to get sanctions relief or other concessions and then reverse course. Skepticism is warranted.                         
                               
**Finally, Congress Sides With the Big Banks!**
-----------------------------------------------------------------
**Today, 17 members of the Democratic caucus joined Senate Republicans to support a [bill](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/6/17081508/senate-banking-bill-crapo-regulation?h_sid=83836082)** that will allow large banks to take on greater risk with less oversight. Progressives like Elizabeth Warren are understandably furious. Why?                                       
                                           
**First, it’s a bill that could make another bank bailout more likely.** The proposal would rewrite parts of the Dodd-Frank Act so that large banks could hold riskier assets on their balance sheets, and more banks would be exempt from stricter oversight. Currently, banks with assets greater than $50 billion experience stricter oversight from the Federal Reserve. This bill would raise that threshold to [$250 billion](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/6/17081508/senate-banking-bill-crapo-regulation?h_sid=83836082), leaving fewer than [10 banks](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/us/politics/democrats-banking-rules.html?h_sid=83836082) (that’s right, ten) subject to certain rules designed to prevent another financial collapse. Awesome.                                                      
                                                
**Second, Democrats are voting for this bill without any kind of concession from Republicans,** even though Republicans need Democratic votes to meet the 60-vote threshold. There are many demands Democrats could make as part of this negotiation to protect consumers against the excesses of Wall Street. For example, they could demand that Trump appoint an independent consumer watchdog to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is temporarily being run by Trump lackey Mick Mulvaney, who wants to shut it down. But these Democrats, with the blessing of Senate leadership, are cooperating with Republicans on a bill that helps big banks without asking for anything in return. They’re hoping you don’t notice, but it’s not too late to stop this bill. Give those Democrats a [call](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm?OrderBy=state+&amp;h_sid=83836082)!

**What Else**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This followed Trump’s imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum, despite Cohn’s objections. Chaos, corruption, obstruction of justice, racism—sure that’s bad. But Gary Cohn has a line. And the line is tariffs.

According to new reports, Nader represented the UAE crown prince at a January 2017 meeting in the Seychelles between a Russian investor close to Putin and Erik Prince, an informal Trump adviser and the founder of Blackwater. UAE officials believed Prince represented the Trump transition team in the meeting, which Prince has since denied. Nader is not only cooperating with Mueller—the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/us/politics/george-nader-special-counsel-mueller-cooperating-seychelles.html?h_sid=83836082#click=https://t.co/3Dqq44Suz0) is reporting that he testified to a grand jury last week.

**“The Russians had no impact on our votes whatsoever.** But certainly there was meddling and probably there was meddling from other countries and maybe other individuals…. we’ll counteract whatever they do.

**Bad Punditry**
----------------------------------------------------------------------
**On Sunday, Axios touted a [scoop](https://www.axios.com/robert-muller-questions-list-trump-russia-54d00d1c-f008-457c-b304-ee601a98d78c.html?h_sid=83836082), sourced to a witness, describing a grand jury subpoena** for communications between the anonymous witness and members of the Trump team. On Tuesday, after Sam Nunberg outed himself as their source and made much larger news by threatening to defy the subpoena, Axios published a [new item](https://www.axios.com/sam-nunberg-metldown-msnbc-cnn-cable-news-mueller-51798471-2535-4d1f-86ba-d3f1417a9e36.html?h_sid=83836082) blasting the media for interviewing Nunberg because he was a “hanger on” in the midst of “a sad, epic meltdown.”                                         
                                        
**Nunberg was one of Trump’s longest-serving political advisers,** and became unglued over a subpoena stemming from a criminal investigation of the Trump campaign. His claims are undeniably newsworthy. The ugliness of the meltdown calls for tact and grace, not silence. It seems strange for a reporter to claim that it is the job of his fellow journalists to protect sources from the consequences of speaking out.                                          
                                                 
**Was Nunberg more reliable when his words were printed anonymously?** Seems unlikely.

**President Trump has agreed to meet North Korean leader [Kim Jong Un](https://twitter.com/AP/status/971902330785423360) by May** to discuss “the goal of denuclearization,” a South Korean National Security Adviser announced tonight. The [White House](https://twitter.com/tparti/status/971909020108902400) said the date and location of the meeting are TBD, but Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/971915531346436096) “meeting being planned!”                              
                                       
**This comes after North Korea “clearly stated” its willingness to negotiate with the U.S. on [denuclearization](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/world/asia/north-korea-south-nuclear-weapons.html?h_sid=eb5053f7d2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** earlier this week. Tonight, South Korea also noted Kim Jong Un “[pledged](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/09/trump-kim-summit-plan-draws-positive-reactions-from-key-players.html) that North Korea will refrain from any further nuclear or missile tests” until the meeting. In the interim, the White House said “all sanctions and maximum pressure [on the regime] must remain.”           
                                  
**The news came as a surprise to virtually everyone**—not even the [Pentagon](https://twitter.com/HansNichols/status/971882931374391296) knew what Trump was referring to when he teased the announcement beforehand. Secretary of State [Rex Tillerson](https://twitter.com/joshledermanAP/status/971903247773466625) had said “we’re a long ways from negotiations” earlier in the day.                                  
                                
**If he follows through with the meeting, Trump will become the [first](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/us/politics/north-korea-kim-jong-un-trump.html?h_sid=eb5053f7d2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) sitting American president to meet with a North Korean leader,** marking a major diplomatic and personal shift. If you’ll recall, he referred to Kim Jong Un as “[little rocket man](https://twitter.com/farhip/status/971905620453613568)” just six months ago. Here’s how [North Korea](https://twitter.com/DPRK_News/status/971908940920508416) is reporting it:                 
                        
**From Tommy Vietor:** Getting a meeting is the easy part, it's what North Korea has wanted for ages. Getting what the U.S. wants out of it is the hard part. It’s disconcerting that Trump’s response is based on South Korea’s interpretation of the meeting. The details are VERY important and North Korea has a long [track record](https://twitter.com/nktpnd/status/971916848747962368) of lies and manipulation. So right now, the real question is whether it's an intelligent move to meet at this level when it's doubtful that there has been any preparation or diplomacy.”                     
                          
**Oh, Also Tariffs**
------------------------------------------------------------
**Trump announced today that his [proposed tariffs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/after-trump-promises-tariff-announcement-staff-scrambles-to-figure-out-what-hell-say/2018/03/08/5e1483e4-22e6-11e8-86f6-54bfff693d2b_story.html?h_sid=eb5053f7d2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.cd1d483d6c0b) on imported steel and aluminum will go into effect on March 23.** Mexico and Canada, which account for a combined [25%](https://twitter.com/AaronBlake/status/971841216848580610) of steel imports, are exempted from the tariffs, and [all countries](https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/971834426341634048) have reportedly been invited to negotiate exclusions of their own. What will it take to get those countries off the tariffs list? A Mar-a-Lago membership? Perhaps a loan to prop up the Kushner empire?? Stay tuned!

Bad news for every American business and job that depends on exports to these regions.                      
                           
**Lawmakers, like Trump’s staff, had no idea what Trump would actually propose today,** and many issued [statements](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/08/trump-tariffs-republicans-448054?h_sid=eb5053f7d2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) against the tariffs. Sen. [Jeff Flake](https://twitter.com/JeffFlake/status/971853531127930880?h_sid=eb5053f7d2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) (R-AZ) said that he will introduce legislation to nullify the tariffs—an important reminder that this is only happening because Congress is allowing it. This White House is run like a junior prom committee with nukes.                                
                            
**Meanwhile, 11 other nations, including American allies,** signed an updated [Trans-Pacific Partnership](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/world/asia/us-trump-tpp-signed.html?h_sid=eb5053f7d2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) trade agreement. President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the agreement upon taking office, so although TPP was our idea, those nations will now get to write global trade rules without us.

From [Dan Pfeiffer](https://twitter.com/danpfeiffer/status/971863611370082305): “This is the sort of corruption that enrages voters and flips the House and Senate, but it requires aggressive, sustained and creative paid and earned messaging.”

----------------------------------------------------------------
**This afternoon, [Sarah Huckabee Sanders](https://www.axios.com/sanders-north-korea-meeting-not-going-to-happenw-1520623351-450f0444-e88d-4b66-830c-b43c6cc594f2.html?h_sid=8cde262fa8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=organic&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_term=politics&amp;utm_content=1100&amp;utm_source=twitter) appeared to pump the brakes on talks with North Korea,** insisting that leader Kim Jong Un must take “concrete actions” to denuclearize before a meeting. However, just hours later, Trump [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/972271520847466498) “the deal with North Korea is very much in the making...time and place to be determined.” It’s almost as if—stick with us here—this was a haphazard decision made without any real planning so no one in the White House, let alone the rest of the administration, has a clue what to say or do.                            
                           
**As of [Friday evening](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-a-trump-kim-summit-scrambles-the-calculus-for-key-players-1520606340?h_sid=8cde262fa8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), North Korea has yet to confirm** the offer to meet with Trump, or to make any public commitments on denuclearization efforts. Our understanding of these promises comes from South Korean officials who had met with North Koreans earlier this month.           
                                 
**Crooked Media’s Take:** We’re glad that Trump has chosen to take a risky diplomatic step instead of a military one, but these negotiations are highly technical and historically take years, not weeks. If the U.S. is going to give North Korea the meeting it has wanted for decades, that decision needs to result in verifiable proof that North Korea is dismantling its nuclear weapons program. In order to reach an agreement like that, Kim Jong Un would have to allow on-the-ground inspections, removal of nuclear material, and a host of other requirements to ensure North Korea is not and cannot make a nuclear weapon.                      
                       
**But it’s not clear that the U.S. and North Korea have the same expectations or goals** and the stakes couldn’t be higher—the intelligence community estimates Kim has up to 60 nukes. By comparison, the Iran deal took seven years of sanctions, diplomacy, secret talks, and active negotiations. Obama didn’t do it alone. There’s no reason to believe Trump can wing this and be successful.                           
                   
**Meeting of the Minds**
------------------------------------------------------------------
**Trump’s lawyers are considering offering Special Counsel Mueller a [sit-down interview](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-lawyers-seek-deal-with-mueller-to-speed-end-of-russia-probe-1520625944?h_sid=8cde262fa8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) with Trump as part of a deal to end his Russia investigation.** One possible deal would only grant an interview if Mueller commits to ending the Russia investigation 60 days after the interview. Trump’s legal team is also trying to limit the scope of Mueller’s questioning, which they expect to focus on Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey and his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Sure, pal. No hard questions and stop the investigation. Anything else? Should Mueller pick up McDonald’s for you?

Cohen [responded](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/09/politics/michael-cohen-trump-organization-email-stormy-daniels/index.html?h_sid=8cde262fa8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) that he used his business account for personal matters and that the funds came from a home equity line of credit. May you have in your life a stooge so dumb and loyal that he uses the money from his home loan to hide your secrets.

According to the Economic Policy Institute, wage increases need to be greater than 3.5% “for workers to claw back losses... they’ve felt during and since the Great Recession.”

It also creates a program to arm some teachers. Following the announcement, the NRA filed a [federal lawsuit](https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/972250693779312640) challenging the legislation raising the purchase age. (P.S.

The rest of the party’s 4,000-plus delegates were “pledged delegates,” or those who had to vote in accordance with the state’s results.

**Oopsie doopsie:** Yesterday we included a tweet from one of our favorite parody accounts, DPRK News. We thought everyone would know it was a joke. We did not think North Korea tweeted a picture of Donald Trump looking for a golf ball. We will be more clear in the future. What did you guys think of how the gang approached Jordan Peterson’s admittedly shitty and context-less clip on the lastest PSA? 

I’ve always considered myself a liberal, but I feel as though they did not do JP justice. He is in no way a misogynist or a misandrist, he takes great care to make that clear in the hundreds of hours of lectures he has online. It seems as though they just used his three spoken sentences as bait for their skit.

They might not agree with him, but if you’ve heard him on Joe Rogan or Sam Harris’ podcasts he is a really erudite and experienced man. I would love to see them have an honest and open discussion about US (gender) politics. 

Also way to go Tommy, the guy who hosts Pod Save the World, for pointing out JP is Canadian. He of all people shouldn’t have made that a punchline, and I’m sure all of them invite Canadian criticism when it’s levied at American healthcare "I don't know how to make this part of the right message, but I do think that what we're seeing with wages not going up very fast is sort of the same structural economic problem we've seen for decades that the economy grows, the economy contracts, and yet we don't see benefits accruing to the vast majority of people. I think part of what explains Trump, beyond all the obvious causes, is some kind of fundamental sense among people that things aren't fair, and that we, each of us, don't have enough dignity in the society as we used to have, and that's something that crosses parties, because I think you see some of that same feeling in the desire for revolutionary change with Bernie Sanders, it's something you see across races, Donald Trump appealed to by using racism for white voters, but that same sense that something is broken in our economy, in our culture, that saps us of dignity in our dealings with our bosses at work, where we don't feel we have enough power, with the companies we give money to every day, the cable companies, and the airlines, and the banks, and the people we deal with. And I think Democrats don't necessarily have, none of us have the language to talk about this, and I don't have the language to talk about this, but I think about it all the time, I think about it when we talk about the way in which people leave the Trump administration and pay no price for it, and it seems like it's disconnected, but a culture that doesn't prize basic values about fairness, integrity, honesty, is a culture in which people feel as though they're not going to be, in which the only way to get ahead is to cheat, and steal, and lie, and that brokenness is part of our politics and it's a huge part of our culture and I don't think anyone has the language."**Collusion Conclusion**

**Today the Republicans of the House Intelligence Committee [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/us/politics/house-intelligence-trump-russia.html?h_sid=7b16a52cf3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;smid=tw-share) that they found no evidence of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia in the 2016 election.** What a relief! That’s the exact opposite finding of the intelligence community. The Republican-led House committee finished interviewing witnesses last week (note that they never interviewed [Trump](http://www.businessinsider.com/when-will-russia-investigation-end-house-intelligence-2018-3?h_sid=7b16a52cf3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) himself), and Rep.

[Saccone](https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/973375629637791744) reacted well: “They say the other side is energized… they’re energized for hate for our president… [they] have a hatred for our country… they have a hatred for God.” Big fan of tact and nuance, that guy.

I would give so much just to sit down and have a conversation with this guy. Like recently in his rant he did on PSA after the Jordan Peterson clip, i thought that was so amazing and insightful and I would love to read a book by him on the subject area.

Lamb [swung](https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/973936856256712704) 172 precincts that went to Trump in 2016, while his opponent Rick Saccone took a grand total of 0 districts that went to Clinton. The Pennsylvania 18th marks the [42nd seat](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C2MVeM2K7WgqmJw5RCQbWyTo2u73CX1pI8zw_G-7BJo/edit?h_sid=60bba73587-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84#gid=546409300) to flip from Republican to Democrat since Trump became President.              
                    
**The Republican spin on the loss is wonderful.** After Republicans spent more than [$9 million](https://www.vox.com/2018/3/6/17087480/pennsylvania-18-lamb-saccone-republican-money?h_sid=60bba73587-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) calling Lamb a Pelosi-style liberal, [Paul Ryan](https://twitter.com/markknoller/status/973932627282616323) claimed that Lamb ran as a “conservative,” and the White House [said](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/14/politics/white-house-pa-18-reaction/index.html?h_sid=60bba73587-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) he won in part by “embracing Trump’s policies.” Lamb did support Trump’s tariffs and was critical of Pelosi; but he also campaigned in favor of Obamacare, expanded background checks, stronger unions, a woman’s right to choose, and legalizing medical marijuana, while opposing Trump's tax cuts, cuts to Medicare, and cuts to Social Security. Not exactly a member of the Tea Party, Paul.                              
                               
**Turnout was also high for a special election like this—it captured 62 percent of the 2016 presidential turnout.** It was especially high in Democratic areas of the district. According to FiveThirtyEight’s [Nate Silver](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-enthusiasm-gap-could-turn-a-democratic-wave-into-a-tsunami/?h_sid=60bba73587-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84): “That sort of turnout gap suggests that registered-voter polls could be underrating Democrats in this year’s midterms—and could turn a challenging year for Republicans into a catastrophic one.”                      
                             
**Bottom line: You see the numbers.** Conor Lamb is heading to Washington because of 627 votes. From [Jon Favreau](https://twitter.com/jonfavs/status/973907305010954241): “Never think your vote, or phone call, or door knock, or $10 donation won’t make a difference. It all adds up.

**New York Magazine’s Olivia Nuzzi chronicles the departure of Hope Hicks,** the “only person [Trump] trusts.” Though Hicks doesn’t speak on the record, Nuzzi was able to speak with over 30 current and former White House officials and staffers close to Trump to paint a portrait of the world inside the West Wing:          
                         
**“The people who were problems on the campaign or on the inside continued to be problems.** The president’s taste for the other and the new was so established that the most driven among them knew that all they had to do was wait for an opening, or shrewdly create one — a weakened staffer, a particularly demoralizing news cycle — and they could worm their way back in. The madness engulfing the White House, in other words, was not just a matter of staff infighting or factional ideological rivalries, as it was often portrayed in the press, but also, in part, the result of manipulation from the fringes of Trumpworld.”

**From Brian Beutler:** This week’s revelations about the lawlessness of Trump’s data firm, Cambridge Analytica, are stunning in their own right but blend seamlessly into the culture of impunity Trump has built around himself. Pluck nearly any Trump-administration outrage out of the litany—his self-enrichment and openness to bribery, his cabinet full of grifters bilking the public for ludicrous travel perks and other dubious expenses, his campaign’s collaboration with Russians subverting the election—and it fits a picture of continued indifference to rules and the well-being of people outside his circle. The pivot to serving the public interest never happened.

• $1.6 billion for border funding (Trump wanted $25 billion for a wall, and [threatened to veto](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-second-thoughts-omnibus_us_5ab29465e4b0decad0463d6d?h_sid=81b1b300e5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) the bill when he didn’t get it, until Paul Ryan talked him off the ledge)

• $4.7 billion to fight the opioid epidemic                     
                
• A pay raise for the troops                      
                   
• The Fix NICS bill that’d make modest improvements to the existing national background check system.                    
                     
**Not in the bill:** protections for Dreamers, an Obamacare stabilization package, or anything to protect Mueller.

The [House Freedom Caucus](https://twitter.com/freedomcaucus/status/976638597192470529), however, isn’t on board. Their classic objections were there: no border security, no concealed-carry reciprocity, and no defunding of Planned Parenthood and sanctuary cities. But they did have one good point: “leadership is forcing a vote on this 2,232-page bill in under 36 hours, far from an adequate amount of time to read and analyze it.”

Seems contradictory, unless Trump’s sweet spot is that he wants to talk to Mueller under oath (or claim he’ll do it) while reserving the right to say mean things about him on Twitter.         
                   
**Meanwhile the Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee [released a summary](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/house-intelligence-committee-vote-releasing-gop-russia-report/story?h_sid=79bdf6773f-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;id=53930805) of their forthcoming report on Russian election meddling** which essentially concludes that Trump is genetically incapable of doing crimes. We should all hope to have loved ones in our lives who support us the way Devin Nunes supports Donald Trump.

[China responded](https://twitter.com/ZekeJMiller/status/976978825274970112) by saying it may raise their tariffs on U.S. pork, aluminum and other goods. No tweet tariffs yet, sadly.                              
              
**Speaking of the steel and aluminum tariffs,** the Trump administration announced that four more countries—Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea—will be [exempt](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/business/us-eu-tariffs-steel-aluminum.html?h_sid=79bdf6773f-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) from the import tariffs, joining the European Union, Canada, and Mexico.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has scheduled a vote for 1 a.m. Saturday (an hour past when the government would shut down), which will only be necessary under Senate rules if the senators can’t agree on allowing a vote before then. Even if the government ends up shutting down for a few hours, this thing will pass by this weekend.

**Didn't Even Take The Cap Off That Veto Pen, Huh?**
--------------------------------------------------------------------
**Hours after threatening to veto a $1.3 trillion government spending bill passed by the Senate overnight, President Trump [signed it anyway](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/us/politics/trump-veto-spending-bill.html?h_sid=0bd97cb91b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).** In brief remarks, Trump said “there are a lot of things that I’m unhappy about in this bill.”        
                             
**The sources of his unhappiness:**                   
                
• **The so-called “omnibus” bill only included enough border wall funding** to build [33 miles of fence](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/22/funding-for-border-wall-in-spending-bill-divides-conservatives-and-establishment-republicans.html?h_sid=0bd97cb91b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), something noted by the world’s most important television program, Fox &amp; Friends.                 
               
• **The bill didn’t protect young immigrants covered by DACA.** You might be surprised to learn that he blamed Democrats for this, even though Trump unilaterally terminated DACA and has refused every bipartisan compromise on the issue.                     
                 
• **Lawmakers passed the massive spending bill in such a short time,** which led Trump to grumble that “nobody read it.” Oddly enough, Trump had no such complaint when the corporate tax bill was passed so quickly that last-minute changes were literally [scribbled in the margins](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/1/16726234/handwritten-republican-tax-bill?h_sid=0bd97cb91b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).                
                
**Anyway, Trump said he would have vetoed the omnibus but he couldn’t, because of the bill’s funding for the military.** He does it all for the troops

The goal: enacting common-sense gun control after the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 dead on February 14. The students have worked tirelessly to organize the protest in just a few weeks, and have raised more than $4 million while managing to hold the nation’s attention on this issue.                              
              
**The rallying cry has expanded beyond Parkland** and student organizers have sought to lift up the voices of marginalized young people facing gun violence on a daily basis. Parkland students discussed this in an interview with *[TIME](http://time.com/longform/never-again-movement/?h_sid=0bd97cb91b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)*, saying they “know that other youth campaigns against gun violence, including those led by black activists in urban communities, have not gotten the same financial support or media attention. ‘We came from an affluent area, and we’re mostly white, and we have to use that privilege.’”

**Ahead of the march, Trump announced [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/977286489410240514) that the Justice Department would issue a rule banning bump stocks—**devices that allow a semi-automatic weapon to fire more rapidly.

He also claimed that the Obama administration “legalized” bump stocks. This is...not true. What is true: the DOJ under Obama determined that federal gun laws prevented them from banning bump stocks without further action from Congress while Trump’s DOJ went with a tougher interpretation of current law.

• **Daniels says she was threatened:** In 2011, shortly after she spoke with a tabloid, Daniels claims she was approached in a parking lot by a man she had never seen who said: ’Leave Trump alone. Forget the story.’ He then looked at Daniels’s infant daughter and said, ‘That’s a beautiful little girl. It’d be a shame if something happened to her mom.’

The marches were also an opportunity for organizers hoping to channel engagement and outrage into votes. HeadCount, which has helped register voters at Pod Tours America events this year, [registered almost 5,000 people](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/march-our-lives-pushes-expand-voter-rolls-across-country-n859756?h_sid=198d5716b7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) to vote during the protests.

**We have a lot of work to do to take back the Congress.** But the challenge doesn’t stop there. As Brian Beutler noted today, passing common-sense proposals, like a ban on assault weapons or stricter background checks, will require 60 votes in the Senate as long as the legislative filibuster remains in place.That’s what happened in [2013](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/150?h_sid=198d5716b7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) after Sandy Hook, when Republicans like Marco Rubio (joined by four Democrats) blocked a bipartisan compromise bill in the Senate. This may be the fight that Stoneman Douglas students—and all of us—have to take up next.

**The New Dumbest Thing I Have Ever Heard**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
**NFL cheerleaders and players have [VERY different expectations of conduct](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/sports/saints-cheerleader.html?h_sid=198d5716b7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;smid=tw-share),** as evidenced by a lawsuit from a former New Orleans Saints cheerleader who claims she was unfairly dismissed because of sexist rules.              
              
**Among the rules discovered by *The New York Times* that apply to cheerleaders but not players:**                              
             
• An anti-fraternization policy that requires cheerleaders to avoid contact with players in-person or online                         
           
• A policy requiring cheerleaders to block EVERY player on all social media (there are over 2,000 in the NFL)                    
             
• A policy requiring cheerleaders immediately leave any restaurant if a player arrives or is already present                              
                   
**According to the team, the rules “are designed to protect cheerleaders from players preying on them,”** which is a great way to hold women accountable for the misconduct of men. Give me an “E”! Give me a “W”! What’s that spell? Ew.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
**The Trump administration wants the 2020 Census to include [a question about citizenship status](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/us/politics/census-citizenship-question-trump.html?h_sid=bea9981697-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) for the first time in 70 years. [Why is this a problem](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/us/politics/census-citizenship-question.html?h_sid=bea9981697-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)?** Undocumented immigrants might be afraid to respond, even though courts have ruled that citizens and non-citizens must be counted. If immigrants are undercounted, many communities won’t get the funding or representation in Congress that they deserve. Because the Census is only conducted every 10 years, the damage would be long-lasting.                                     
                         
**This proposal is already facing legal challenges** from [multiple state Attorneys General](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/03/27/california-sues-trump-administration-over-decision-to-add-citizenship-question-to-census/?h_sid=bea9981697-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.3316519d0002) as well as the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder.                                 
                
**From Brian Beutler:** Part of the reason Democrats aren’t runaway favorites to capture the House in the fall is that they are still living under the gerrymandered maps Republicans drew after winning landslide majorities in the 2010 midterms, a Census year that gave them control over redistricting. This latest change to the Census is a bid to hold on to as much control over the next round of redistricting as they can, and in a way that panders to the Trumpiest faction of the GOP base. It’s antidemocratic, anti-empirical, and racist, and shouldn’t be allowed to stand.                
              
**Another Brick In The Dumb Wall**
---------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump now says the Department of Defense (America’s, not Mexico’s, FYI) [should pay for his border wall](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-privately-presses-for-military-to-pay-for-border-wall/2018/03/27/d79907a2-31c9-11e8-9759-56e51591e250_story.html?tid=ss_tw&amp;utm_term=.d4816c188735&amp;h_sid=bea9981697-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** using tax dollars appropriated to the Pentagon for other purposes. Trump floated the plan to House Speaker Paul Ryan last week, who reportedly “offered little reaction,” which is probably what he does when the President suggests dumb ideas that Ryan is too chickenshit to oppose. Paul Ryan’s eyes must roll so hard before he fails to confront the president in private and/or in public.                            
              
**The truth: Trump won’t get his wall unless Congress funds it.** Right now, they don’t have the votes to do that unless Trump agrees to protect the Dreamers. If Trump could maintain interest in a topic for more than the length of a cable news segment, he would make that deal.                                 
                 
**When asked about it, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders [responded](https://twitter.com/JDiamond1/status/978703413268623360):** “I can’t get into the specifics of that at this point.” Translation: “There’s no way for me to explain this without making myself and my boss look very stupid. I chose this life.”

This is the most hotly anticipated congressional hearing since James Comey testified that he wouldn’t do anything differently(!).

According to *The New York Times*, the deal leverages Trump’s threat of steel and aluminum tariffs to allow for auto imports from American companies like Ford and General Motors, extend tariffs on South Korean truck exports, and reduce the amount of steel South Korea can export to the United States.

**Trump’s former lawyer John Dowd reportedly discussed [Trump issuing pardons to his former campaign advisers](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/us/politics/trump-pardon-michael-flynn-paul-manafort-john-dowd.html?h_sid=ae7d9dc853-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) Paul Manafort and Mike Flynn with their lawyers** while they were under investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller last year. This raises questions about whether Dowd dangled the prospect of pardons to entice them to not cooperate with Mueller—something that strikes us as an awful lot like witness tampering. Also sounds obstruction-y, which is very on brand.                              
                      
**Flynn still struck a plea deal and is cooperating,** but Manafort has pleaded not guilty to all charges, and (apparently) continues to resist Mueller’s efforts to flip him. Perhaps because he thinks Trump might pardon him?                       
              
**But Mueller has other ways to pressure Manafort.** On Tuesday evening, Mueller filed a memorandum in district court. Here’s what it says: During the election, Manafort’s business partner and Trump’s deputy campaign manager, Rick Gates, was [in contact](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/manafort-associate-had-russian-intelligence-ties-during-2016-campaign-prosecutors-say/2018/03/28/473228e8-3231-11e8-8bdd-cdb33a5eef83_story.html?h_sid=ae7d9dc853-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.f7fce80523f0) with a business associate who had known, ongoing ties to the Russian intelligence agency [responsible](https://www.thedailybeast.com/exclusive-lone-dnc-hacker-guccifer-20-slipped-up-and-revealed-he-was-a-russian-intelligence-officer?h_sid=ae7d9dc853-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) for hacking DNC emails.

Such an amendment would cripple the government’s ability to respond to national emergencies, and would almost certainly lead to huge cuts in food stamps, Social Security, and Medicare, which is probably why they proposed the amendment in the first place.                               
                
**The good news is that amending the Constitution is very hard, so the BBA will go nowhere after a vote in Congress.** Which must be a relief for Republicans who are seeking another round of deficit-financed tax cuts.

(And it’s not like Jared is squeaky clean! If we’re firing people for being unethical, they’ll have to make a tumbleweed comms director.)      
             
**He fired Shulkin, it seems, because Shulkin was an obstacle to the agenda of wealthy GOP interests who want to privatize VA health care.** Trump has selected White House physician [Ronny Jackson](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-ousts-veterans-affairs-chief-david-shulkin-in-administrations-latest-shake-up/2018/03/28/3c1da57e-2794-11e8-b79d-f3d931db7f68_story.html?h_sid=47f4b6321e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.1a9c1ec397dd) to replace Shulkin at the VA. Though Jackson is an accomplished Navy physician, he has no relevant administrative experience and we know nothing about his views on issues like privatization.         
               
**From Brian Beutler:** Could this also be a trial run for a potential Mueller firing? Until Jackson is confirmed, Trump is replacing Shulkin with an Acting Secretary from another Cabinet agency who’s already been confirmed by the Senate. This is exactly the move we expect he'd make if he tried to shut down the Russia investigation: Fire Jeff Sessions or Rod Rosenstein, replace them with a toady from another agency who’s already been confirmed by the Senate (like EPA Chief Scott Pruitt), and order that person to fire Mueller. Maybe someone should be scrutinizing the legality of this move?

So either the NDA is void and Cohen is in deep trouble, or there's no attorney-client privilege protecting Trump and Cohen's communications.

Cool arrangement!
                            
              
• **This compounds Pruitt’s [existing ethics scandal](https://newrepublic.com/article/147681/conservative-coddling-scott-pruitt?h_sid=29ddf7414a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84):** wasting taxpayer funds on first-class travel and a $25,000 phone booth, and then lying about it.

**Last week Congress passed a bill called the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act,** which “carries penalties of up to 25 years in federal prison for anyone who runs an internet service 'with the intent to promote or facilitate the prostitution of another person.’” The law has already caused Craigslist to shut down its personals section and Microsoft to change Skype’s and Xbox’s terms of service.                                  
                
**But critics say not all the changes are good:** “Some sex workers argue the bill will hurt those who voluntarily work in the sex industry by pushing them off the internet and back on to the streets. Internet advocates say the bill may the beginning of a crackdown on free speech online.”

**A Texas woman was sentenced to FIVE years in prison because she [voted while on probation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/03/30/texas-woman-sentenced-to-5-years-in-prison-for-voting-while-on-probation/?h_sid=29ddf7414a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.e978cbfa5bc9).** If she had known it was illegal, she said she never would’ve cast a ballot in the 2016 presidential election, but no one (including her probation officer) told her that being a felon on probation meant she couldn’t vote. Now a Texas judge is sending her BACK TO PRISON for illegal voting. Five years for this mistake. For casting a ballot she [should have the right to cast](https://twitter.com/verainstitute/status/967191417012486146).

On Tuesday, a U.S. District judge ordered Gov. Rick Scott (R) to find a way to restore these voting rights by April 26. The current system in Florida forces ex-felons to wait at least five years before they can ask for the right to vote.

**“The link between immigration and crime exists in the imagination of Americans and nowhere else.”**                     
               
**Nearly half of Americans believe immigrants make crime worse,** according to Gallup polls cited in [new *Marshall Project* investigation](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/03/30/the-myth-of-the-criminal-immigrant?h_sid=29ddf7414a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84). However, as immigration has shot up by 118% since 1980, violent crime in America has DECREASED by 36%. In fact, the data shows it’s possible that immigration actually *reduces* the crime rate.

Have any of you been to the Improv to see LIOLI? If so, how do you get your tickets?

I've checked the Improv's website and Seatgeek, and neither of them have any mention of the show.We're not doing general political posts anymore but - I thought it might be a good idea to try out weekly posts. From what's under the radar to what you are keeping to the hill you want to die on to ending the week on a high note.

This is a test run. 

Today's post will be The Hill I Want To Die On, inspired by Hysteria. What petty belief do you hold with burning conviction? 

Edit: Oh - to be clear, most of these posts will revolve around politics but I wanted to start out light. *"I know this because I have experienced this firsthand on Martha's Vineyard."—[Alan Dershowitz](http://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/394346-maxine-waters-does-not-speak-for-democrats-or-liberals?h_sid=6944d4d43c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), who is unhappy that people on Martha's Vineyard aren't being nice to him because he has defended Trump*                                 
                
**Justice is Blindly Loyal**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump [has interviewed four potential Supreme Court justices](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/02/us/politics/trump-supreme-court-nomination.html?h_sid=6944d4d43c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) and will interview more this week,** ahead of a formal nomination early this month.                  
              
**His [two leading candidates](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-supreme-court-nominee-judge-brett-kavanaugh-amy-coney-barrett-leading-contenders/?h_sid=6944d4d43c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) are reportedly Brett Kavanaugh, a 53-year-old judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals,** and [Amy Barrett](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/amy-coney-barrett-abortion-rights-federal-judge_us_59f87abde4b0aec1467ac111?h_sid=6944d4d43c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), a 46-year-old judge whom Trump appointed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals last year.                         
                  
**Both are on [Trump’s list of 25 judges](https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-surprises-expected-in-trumps-next-supreme-court-pick-1530229181?h_sid=6944d4d43c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;ns=prod%2Faccounts-wsj) the conservative Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation pre-approved during the election.** In other words, they are considered safe bets by people who want to overturn *Roe v. Wade*, pare back voting rights, and eliminate environmental and economic regulations.                              
                
**Barrett is relatively inexperienced, but some conservatives believe that—because a handful of Democrats already voted to confirm her** to a lower court, and because she is a woman—her confirmation fight would be easier on Republicans, even though she is anti-choice. On the other hand, her positions on both *Roe v. Wade* and the Affordable Care Act are [unusually clear](https://www.afj.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Barrett-Report.pdf?h_sid=6944d4d43c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) for a potential Supreme Court nominee, which would make her a political liability for vulnerable Republicans.                       
                      
**Kavanaugh has a more typical profile for a GOP SCOTUS nominee in some ways, but is controversial in others.** He rose to prominence as a Republican operative, and [Democrats were broadly opposed to confirming him](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-court-kavanaugh-barrett-20180628-story.html?h_sid=6944d4d43c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) to the circuit court when President George W. Bush nominated him. He was a principal author of The Starr Report who reportedly [once called Hillary Clinton a “bitch.”](http://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/clinton-scandals-2014-4/index2.html?h_sid=6944d4d43c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) He’s [also argued](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-supreme-court-candidate-brett-kavanaugh-20180629-story.html?h_sid=6944d4d43c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) that presidents should be exempt from criminal and civil complaints. Trump must hate that!                      
              
**Whether any of these pre-approved judges can be confirmed to the Supreme Court will likely turn on whether Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can unify Republicans.** For the time being, the Senate’s only pro-choice Republicans are being pretty cagey. Over the weekend, [Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME)](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/01/us/politics/susan-collins-supreme-court-nominee-abortion.html?h_sid=6944d4d43c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) said she would oppose nominees who were openly hostile to *Roe v. Wade*, but also suggested that as long as Trump nominates someone who hasn’t created an anti-Roe paper trail, she will vote to confirm. For instance, on CNN, she [claimed to believe](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/01/politics/susan-collins-supreme-court/index.html?h_sid=6944d4d43c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch both believe Roe is “settled law,” which means she is either fooling herself, or trying to fool the rest of us. Either way, this is gearing up to be a huge political fight with Collins at the center of it.                           
              
**It's Cohen Down**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump’s former lawyer/fixer Michael Cohen [says that in determining whether he will cooperate with federal prosecutors](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/michael-cohen-family-country-president-trump-loyalty/story?h_sid=6944d4d43c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;id=56304585), he will prioritize his wife, children, and country** over all other considerations, including (perhaps?) his loyalty to Trump. All that’s left for him to do is hire a skywriter to spell out “PARDON MC?” over Mar-a-Lago. (Spelling out the name costs more.)                                     
          
**Cohen also revealed to ABC that his new lawyer will soon terminate his joint defense agreement with Trump’s attorneys,** suggesting their interests as subjects of criminal investigations no longer align—i.e. that Cohen might soon flip on the bossman.                                  
                  
**He reluctantly declined to say whether Trump directed a $130,000 hush money payment to Stormy Daniels,** or knew of a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between his son Donald Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort, and multiple Russian agents promising dirt on Hillary Clinton, which could be a signal to prosecutors that he has special knowledge on both issues.                           
                    
**Cohen might also be sending a signal to Trump: Pardon me now, or I’m going to crack.** After all, if he wanted to cooperate with prosecutors, he could communicate that to them directly. But Cohen has exposure for violations of New York state laws, which a presidential pardon wouldn’t cover. That’s why it looks more like he’s laying groundwork to tell prosecutors what he knows.

His election follows [an incredibly violent campaign season](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/01/world/americas/mexico-election-assassinations.html?h_sid=6944d4d43c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) in the country, resulting in the deaths of at least 136 politicians.

**Twitter won’t shut up about [this video](https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1013784579243724801) of a woman who tried to hand-feed a shark, but got dragged into the water instead.** What did you think was going to happen here, exactly, ma’am?

**#JusticeForNoura on Twitter: "[milk and henny](https://twitter.com/darfurdarling/status/1013291159152746497)"**We're not doing general political posts anymore but - I thought it might be a good idea to try out weekly posts. From what's under the radar to what you are keeping to the hill you want to die on to ending the week on a high note.

This is a test run.

Today's post will be Under the Radar, inspired by Pod Save America. What news are you all het up about that hasn't broken through the mainstream yet?

Just devoured Dan’s book and am about to dive into Ben Rhodes’ “The World As It Is”.  Any other recommendations for some summer reading?Trying to find the first Lovett rant when the audience hissed, anyone know where to direct me? *"The fake news constantly likes to pour over my tweets looking for a mistake."—DJT. *Pore.*                        
                        
**ICE Feels The Bern**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Today, NBC News reported that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents are giving asylum seekers at the border [no choice but to be deported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/new-trump-admin-order-separated-parents-leave-u-s-kids-n888631?h_sid=089f4720a9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).** According to official documents, these parents can only choose whether they want to return to their home countries alone, or with their children—they are not given an option to stay and make an asylum claim.                    
               
**This new tactic denies asylum seekers their due process rights and may even violate a June court order** requiring the Trump administration to reunite the over 2,000 children it seized at the border with their parents.       
                     
**Against this backdrop, more Democrats are joining calls for significant immigration enforcement reforms,** including for abolishing ICE altogether. [Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-abolish-ice_us_5b3bba5ce4b05127cced1535?h_sid=089f4720a9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) called today for restructuring ICE as part of a broader push to “abolish the cruel, dysfunctional immigration system we have today and pass comprehensive immigration reform.”                         
                 
**Many other Senate Democrats, like Sanders, have fallen short of calling for the elimination of ICE,** but the rallying cry has helped shift the center of the immigration debate away from defensive responses to Trump’s scapegoating of immigrants, and toward a more humane discussion. Republicans, of course, have responded by [lying systematically](https://twitter.com/GOP/status/1014202613380861953) about why some Democrats want to abolish ICE, and [what the consequences of it would be](https://twitter.com/GOP/status/1014220983576776705).
                                                             
                 
**How Does Scott Pruitt Look People in the Eye?**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**CNN reports that earlier this year, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt asked President Trump to fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions** and [replace Sessions with himself](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/03/politics/scott-pruitt-jeff-sessions-trump/index.html?h_sid=089f4720a9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).                                
               
**Pruitt’s interest in the job has been widely reported, as has Trump’s desire to obstruct or terminate Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation** by placing a loyalist at the helm of the Justice Department. This new revelation suggests Pruitt almost got his way, and might explain why Trump has tolerated Pruitt’s corruption.       
                           
**Just today we learned:**                     
                        
- Pruitt had his 25-year-old aide book hotel rooms for him on her credit card and [didn’t pay her back](http://www.businessinsider.com/scott-pruitt-had-staffers-book-hotels-and-then-never-paid-them-back-2018-7?h_sid=089f4720a9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;r=UK&amp;IR=T). Cool boss!

**Believe it or not, there used to be this co-equal branch of government called Congress that could “check” corruption in the executive branch.** Quaint! Like typewriters or integrity.

**SCOTUS Pick: Brett Kavanaugh**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump’s second Supreme Court nominee is [Brett Kavanaugh](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court.html?h_sid=2638f62232-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), a conservative judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals,** whom Trump selected, as promised, from a list of 25 pre-approved judges that the ultra-conservative Heritage Foundation put together to maximize right-wing power. Not good.                            
                  
**[Kavanaugh](https://www.vox.com/explainers/2018/7/9/17540334/brett-kavanaugh-trump-supreme-court-anthony-kennedy?h_sid=2638f62232-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) was a Republican operative who made his name in legal circles as senior counsel for Ken Starr’s sprawling and highly partisan investigation of Bill Clinton,** during which he was once overheard at a social function hosted by right wing propagandist Laura Ingraham [calling Hillary Clinton a “bitch.”](https://twitter.com/brianbeutler/status/1013972697091584000) Seriously. Kavanaugh was President George W. Bush’s staff secretary, and had no judicial experience when Bush nominated him to the DC Circuit. Democrats overwhelmingly opposed his nomination, which stalled for years, but he has served as a reliably conservative vote on that court for over a decade.                             
              
**And of course the purpose of the list was to install another Supreme Court justice who will be a reliable vote for conservatives.** Where retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy ruled for corporate power and against voting rights, Kavanaugh will also rule for corporate interests and against voting rights; but where Kennedy voted decisively to uphold reproductive rights, gay rights, and affirmative action, Kavanaugh is very unlikely to follow suit. Not good!
                                      
           
**Many liberals are no doubt tempted to despair. And there is a lot to be unhappy about. (Don’t stop reading here.)** But Democrats also have an opportunity to make the stakes of the nomination clear. If every Senate Democrat opposes Kavanaugh, then every single Republican will become a decisive vote on critical questions, like whether abortion will be criminalized, or remain a constitutionally protected right.                          
                        
**From Brian:** Even the loss of a Supreme Court seat wouldn’t signify permanent defeat for liberals—it would illustrate anti-democratic flaws in our system of government, which liberals can and must make a high priority of fixing.

Insisting that public officials aren’t corrupt and cruel or creepy bosses should transcend ideology. (Emphasis on “should.”)                        
            
**Pruitt fawned over Trump in his embarrassingly obsequious [resignation letter](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2018/07/05/scott-pruitt-resignation-letter/761174002/?h_sid=2638f62232-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), and blamed his departure on the media’s “unrelenting attacks” on him.** [Cough, “Pardon me?

Sir?” Cough.] But Trump administration officials had been [leaning on Trump to fire Pruitt for months](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/climate/trump-fire-pruitt-epa.html?h_sid=2638f62232-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), understanding that Pruitt could become a huge political liability.

**To Kavanaugh or Kava-not?**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has a [long track record](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-10/court-pick-kavanaugh-is-washington-insider-regulation-skeptic?h_sid=abb207957b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) as both a judge and a Republican operative.** He had a heavy hand in writing *The Starr Report* about the sprawling Clinton investigation; he served as a top aide to President George W. Bush for years; he sat through a [contentious confirmation hearing](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11433231&amp;h_sid=abb207957b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) to become a federal judge; and he’s published countless judicial opinions and other legal writings. There is a wealth of information out there—some of it public, some of it private—that Democrats will be able to deploy in the hope that at least one Republican senator develops second thoughts.      
                      
**From the public sphere:**                       
             
- **Kavanaugh is an extremely conservative judge who will be on board with the Roberts Court’s ongoing project of [gutting labor law](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/us/politics/supreme-court-unions-organized-labor.html?h_sid=abb207957b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) and [voting rights](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/25/politics/supreme-court-voting-rights-gerrymandering/index.html?h_sid=abb207957b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** and will allow the Court to kick off its aspirational project of [gutting reproductive rights](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/05/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-impeachment.html?h_sid=abb207957b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), and possibly even protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Not good.              
                  
- **During the Clinton presidency, Kavanaugh believed that presidents should have crippling [exposure to criminal law and impeachment](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/top-supreme-court-prospect-has-argued-presidents-should-not-be-distracted-by-investigations-and-lawsuits/2018/06/29/2dd9c1cc-7baa-11e8-80be-6d32e182a3bc_story.html?h_sid=abb207957b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.92133f802c44&amp;noredirect=on). After working for Bush, he decided that presidents should be [*immune from criminal investigations*](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/10/627504728/brett-kavanaugh-supported-broad-leeway-for-presidents-under-investigation?h_sid=abb207957b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** like the one Special Counsel Robert Mueller is conducting. That’s a [crazy reversal](https://crooked.com/article/brett-kavanaughs-achilles-heel/?h_sid=abb207957b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) and it demonstrates horrible judgment.                     
            
- **Kavanaugh seemingly [lied under oath to Senate Democrats](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/04/washington/04judge.html?h_sid=abb207957b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), including to the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee,** who referred him to the Justice Department and is still in office. Cool nominee. Should be a fun hearing.                       
                 
**We also deserve to learn more about what isn’t public.** For instance:                    
                
- **As a heavily partisan operator, he privately [called Hillary Clinton a “bitch”](http://www.newsweek.com/trumps-scotus-nominee-brett-kavanaugh-called-hillary-clinton-bitch-book-1015461?h_sid=abb207957b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** and reporters who covered the Starr investigation have suggested that he [lawlessly leaked details to reporters](https://twitter.com/jonathanalter/status/1016830859742273536) (in contrast to Mueller’s leak-free investigation). Is there any other misconduct during that period that speaks to his partisan bias?                
                    
- **As Bush’s White House staff secretary, he wrote [thousands of emails that are public record](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/09/brett-kavanaugh-vince-foster-files-703344?h_sid=abb207957b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** but haven’t been published. When President Obama nominated Elena Kagan to the Court from his administration, the White House published her emails. Kavanaugh must be held to the same standard, or must be assumed to be hiding something.                            
              
- **Trump is famous for demanding loyalty and striking corrupt deals.** His White House reportedly [negotiated with Justice Anthony Kennedy](https://twitter.com/nycsouthpaw/status/1016729383527071744) over who would replace him, easing Kennedy into retirement while Kennedy was deciding cases on the administration’s behalf. Did Trump ask Kavanaugh for loyalty? Did Kavanaugh play a role in his own nomination?                    
                 
- **Also, why the fuck was [Rudy Giuliani](https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/watch/why-was-rudy-giuliani-at-trump-s-supreme-court-announcement-1274143811879?h_sid=abb207957b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), Trump’s criminal lawyer, at Kavanaugh’s White House nomination ceremony?** (Was it for the canapes?)                                  
            
**From Brian:** Kavanaugh’s public record on presidents and the law seems less hypocritical than completely reactionary, bouncing from one indefensible position to another without applying any judgment whatsoever. Senate Democrats should take note of that, because explaining away hypocrisy is easy, but explaining away a fatal blindspot like this is not.

**First, [*BuzzFeed*](https://www.buzzfeed.com/emaoconnor/pregnant-migrant-women-miscarriage-cpb-ice-detention-trump?h_sid=abb207957b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.ptWO80P2XY#.qnVk7AYjlP) reports on the harrowing conditions that pregnant migrant women face in detention facilities on the southern border, including mistreatment that causes them to experience miscarriages.** In December, the Department of Homeland Security introduced a new policy that allows for the detention of pregnant women until their their third trimesters—a departure from previous directives under Obama to not detain pregnant women unless in extreme circumstances.                      
                      
**From Brian:** The "pro-life" party is also the party that [thinks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/03/12/rep-steve-king-warns-that-our-civilization-cant-be-restored-with-somebody-elses-babies/?h_sid=abb207957b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) "we can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies," and this is what that looks like in practice.

**Under the Radar**

**Trump [issued pardons for the two insurrectionist Oregon ranchers](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/10/trump-pardons-oregon-ranchers-hammonds-bundy-militia-standoff?h_sid=abb207957b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;CMP=twt_gu) who occupied federal property and were convicted of arson for starting multiple fires on public lands in 2012.** The message to right-wing extremists is that they can commit federal crimes and endanger federal law-enforcement officials with impunity. Fantastic.

As a big fan of Dan, I was disappointed in both the writing and the content of the book. I haven’t read it all because the way he writes really bothers me. It’s like I’m just reading a podcast transcript. He put no effort into his prose and I find that offensive. And more importantly, he didn’t seem to demonstrate while we STILL could? All these months I had the impression he was laying out some strategy for the future of our party. But it’s just another genuflection to Obama.

I love Obama, but for fucks sake. We need to move forward *"[Kelly] was displeased because he was expecting a full breakfast and there were only pastries and cheese."—[Sarah Huckabee Sanders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/07/11/pursed-lips-and-glances-to-the-floor-watch-trump-aides-react-to-his-attacks-on-germany/?h_sid=476d47ccb5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.53616e0da2ee) explaining John Kelly’s look of dismay at the NATO breakfast.

**NATO's Fate-O**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ahead of today’s NATO summit, Madeline Albright and 15 other former foreign ministers around the world [wrote President Trump a letter](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/09/trump-putin-summit-diplomats-albright-703568?h_sid=476d47ccb5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** urging him to work on improving America’s “deteriorating” relationships with allies, and warning him not to ignore the threat Russia poses. It’s safe to assume [he didn’t bother reading it](https://mashable.com/2018/06/01/trump-letter-north-korea-kim-jong-un-lie/?h_sid=476d47ccb5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).                          
                 
**Instead, Trump again accused NATO members of [not spending enough](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-nato-allies-double-defense-spending-goals/story?h_sid=476d47ccb5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;id=56509760) on defense, and saying Germany’s natural gas imports make Germany (a key U.S. ally) a “[captive of Russia](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/11/politics/trump-germany-russia-captive-nato/index.html?h_sid=476d47ccb5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).”** A reprisal of Trump’s “no puppet! you’re the puppet” attack on Hillary Clinton during the debates, but for destroying the alliance that has successfully prevented global thermonuclear war for decades.                                         
                
**This alarming behavior received [resounding criticism](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/11/trump-germany-comments-reaction-708853?h_sid=476d47ccb5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) from both Democratic leaders as well as Republicans, including [Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN)](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/11/politics/bob-corker-trump-america/index.html?h_sid=476d47ccb5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** who said "When I see [U.S.] leadership diminishing and trying to break apart alliances that we created, it troubles me." Oh Bob, you are always so troubled. And yet… you do… what do you do again?                           
           
**Foreign policy analysts are perhaps more alarmed about this** than any of Trump’s previous foreign adventures. They believe his behavior is designed to undermine the alliance and may even be calibrated to bring about it’s collapse sooner than later.                         
          
**Dan Shapiro, the former U.S. ambassador to Israel, who served on President Obama’s National Security Council [warned](https://twitter.com/DanielBShapiro/status/1016435137708544001),** “we could be on the on the cusp of a completely new era, a fundamental reshaping of the international order. And I don't mean over the course of the Trump Administration. I mean by next week.”                            
               
**“If he sabotages the NATO summit the way he did the G-7,” Shapiro added, “don't be surprised if he actually makes a move toward exiting NATO.”**                   
           
**This dovetails with new reporting from the *New Yorker*’s Adam Entous, who [discovered](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/israeli-saudi-and-emirati-officials-privately-pushed-for-trump-to-strike-a-grand-bargain-with-putin?h_sid=476d47ccb5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) that Russia and the U.S. may be on the cusp of a grand bargain, even as Trump threatens to unravel the Western alliance.** Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE—all countries that have courted Trump—have been encouraging him and Putin to reach an agreement that would require Putin to drive Iranian forces out of Syria and end the conflict there in exchange for the U.S. removing sanctions it imposed on Russia for invading Crimea.                               
             
**Ukraine is not a NATO ally, but by striking such a deal, Trump would signal that he’d take a soft line on Russian incursions into neighboring countries,** which would severely damage an alliance based on mutual defense against outside aggressors. Trump and Putin are scheduled to meet in Helsinki on July 16.                         
           
**From Tommy:** Remember World Wars I and II? Yeah, those were bad. One reason we've managed to keep the peace for the last 70 years is because of the NATO alliance. When Trump attacks NATO or unfairly criticizes our allies, he makes it harder to guarantee the freedom and security of its members, including our own.              
               
**What Else**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Our government has told some immigrant parents that they need to [pay for DNA tests](https://www.thedailybeast.com/government-told-immigrant-parents-to-pay-for-dna-tests-to-be-reunited-with-kids-advocate?h_sid=476d47ccb5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) in order to be reunited with the children we separated from them in the first place.** The tests are being administered by a private contractor that the Department of Health and Human Services is refusing to name. Their refusal is illegal and this situation once again exposes the inhumanity of the Trump administration’s brutal, half-cocked separation policy.                  
                    
**The Trump administration is preparing to impose [more tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/10/politics/ustr-new-china-tariffs-trump/index.html?h_sid=476d47ccb5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).** Not only is this trade war stupid, it is pointless. As Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman [notes](https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1017009563500007425), “he hasn't even told the Chinese—or, for that matter, anyone else—what they would have to do to satisfy him.” From trade to the border, Trump takes hostages and the ransom is always “more.”                        
                 
**Special Counsel Robert Mueller has recordings of former Trump campaign manager/current jail-cell inhabitant [Paul Manafort](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/11/paul-manafort-jail-calls-710445?h_sid=476d47ccb5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)’s phone calls from jail,** where he says he’s been treated like a “VIP” with a [laptop](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/manafort-says-hes-being-treated-like-a-vip-in-jail/?h_sid=476d47ccb5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), his own private shower, no jumpsuit, and his own workspace to prepare for trial. Manafort previously told the judge he couldn’t prepare for trial adequately, but the recordings include him saying he can see all the files like he would’ve been able to at home… 🍿

NICE DEMOCRACY YOU HAVE THERE, WOULD BE A SHAME IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN TO IT.

Joe Manchin (D-WV) voted to confirm him. We struggle to understand why red-state senators think voting for horrible, low-profile Trump nominees is somehow good politics.

**[Tommy Vietor](https://twitter.com/TVietor08/status/1017095573873102848) said it best:** Calling exhaustive reporting by CNN “fake news” is fucking pathetic and shows how worried Jordan is about his story unraveling.

I've noticed the Crooked podcasts seem to have inconsistent audio quality, or problems with audio quality. I listen to PSA, Lovett or Leave It, Keep It, and Hysteria every week in my car driving to work. I can't properly hear Ira (and sometimes Kara) during Keep It, and I can't hear Ziwe or Grace Parra, or most of the women on Hysteria. I listen to other podcasts, chiefly the Stuff You Should Know family, and I don't have trouble with those in my car.

I have brainstormed some reasons as to why this is happening.

1. Crooked Media was originally just PSA and whoever works on their audio only knows how to record white guy voices?
2. CM does not feel like investing in the audio quality for "spinoff" podcasts because they're not sure whether the podcasts will be hits.
3. CM recording engineers are not very good (see 1).
4. The newer hosts don't know how to properly speak into the microphones.
5. It's harder to hear speakers who have a lower tone to their voices (Ira has a pretty deep voice and I have the most trouble hearing him).
6. I am going deaf at the ripe old age of 34.

Is anyone qualified to chime in on this, or does anyone else have these issues? Do I need to purchase a complex earwax removal system??? 

I just want to hear Ira.*"V.I.P."—[Paul Manafort](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/us/politics/manafort-trump-russia-jail-transfer.html?h_sid=b527e3339f-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) describing how he was treated at his old jail*

**Strzok (pronounced “struck,” it’s not that hard) became a household name last winter** when the Justice Department [released text messages](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/us/fbi-trump-russia.html?h_sid=b527e3339f-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) he exchanged with a colleague, Lisa Page, with whom he was having an extramarital affair.                              
           
**Those text messages, spanning 2016 and 2017, contained a lot of unkind words about Donald Trump,** but zero evidence that either Strzok or Page allowed their personal views to interfere with the FBI’s investigation.     
                       
**Trump and Republicans, however, have pretended that the texts represent evidence of a “deep state” conspiracy against Trump.**           
               
**On Thursday, Strzok proved how ridiculous that is. He:**              
          
1. **[Explained](https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1017430161472610304) that he texted mean things about Trump because Trump did terrible shit** like mock the Pakistani-American family of a soldier who was killed in Iraq.                             
                  
2. **Reminded Republicans that if he had wanted to sabotage Trump, [he could have](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/07/12/peter-strzok-just-gave-a-hard-to-rebut-defense-of-the-objectivity-of-the-russia-investigations-origins/?h_sid=b527e3339f-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.016a7d45d3e4&amp;noredirect=on).** “I was one of a handful of people who knew the details of Russian election interference and its possible connections with members of the Trump campaign,” he said. “This information had the potential to derail, and quite possibly, defeat Mr. Trump. But the thought of exposing that information never crossed my mind.”                              
                
**Republicans responded by:**                
                    
1. **Threatening to [hold him in contempt of Congress](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/embattled-fbi-agent-to-appear-before-congress/2018/07/11/7754ad14-854e-11e8-8553-a3ce89036c78_story.html?h_sid=b527e3339f-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.d90abf402fff) for not divulging details about the ongoing Russia investigation.**                        
            
2. **Letting [Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX)](https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1017492740144320512) diss him for being unfaithful to his wife.**                             
            
**From Brian:** Republicans’ real goal was to continue to polarize public opinion around the Russia investigation, because they fear—for good reason—that Mueller has found evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to subvert the 2016 election, and they want to help Trump get away with it. This is why Strzok rightly said the hearing was “another victory notch in Putin’s belt and another milestone in our enemies’ campaign to tear America apart.”                                 
               
**Torn NATO**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump barely managed to leave this week’s NATO summit without completely destroying the NATO alliance.**                     
            
**This morning he [forced an emergency meeting](https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-nato-emergency-meeting-germany-merkel-a7d9d532-4458-457a-9a7e-1419476d1151.html?h_sid=b527e3339f-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=alerts_politics&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=alert&amp;stream=politics) where he reportedly suggested the U.S. would withdraw from NATO** if other member nations don’t increase their defense spending commitments to two percent of their respective GDPs by January.                 
                   
**After doing this, he held an impromptu press conference where he claimed that his bullying worked,** and everyone had agreed to “substantially [up] their commitments.”                           
             
**The leaders of Italy and France, however, [denied that this happened](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/the-latest-nato-holds-emergency-session-amid-trump-demands/2018/07/12/ad506c7a-85ba-11e8-9e06-4db52ac42e05_story.html?h_sid=b527e3339f-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.e83c7b68cb7e),** or that there was any agreement to increase the defense-spending target.                         
                         
**From Brian:** We can breathe a sigh of relief that NATO didn’t disintegrate this week, but that’s a pathetically low bar, and doesn’t mean we won’t be right back in the same predicament next year, when Trump tries to hold NATO allies to commitments they all deny making. Welcome to hell.

- The online pseudonyms Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks, which disseminated the emails, were created by these Russian hackers.

**From Brian:** It’s important that Mueller got to the bottom of this criminal conspiracy, which played out publicly, in time to disrupt Trump’s looming summit with Putin.

[Tarana Burke](https://twitter.com/TaranaBurke/status/1017746933618757632), the founder of the #MeToo movement, used this nonsense to highlight a broader problem with the way we discuss the men whose misconduct has been exposed.                             
             
**Using words and phrases like #MeToo “snared,” “brought down,” or “singled out” men runs counter to reality:** “The fact is these people brought THEMSELVES down with their own behavior. The movement is about people owning their truth and releasing the shame associated with sexual violence,” Burke tweeted. How we see and hear stories being told shapes how we think about them.

**Summit of all Fears**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump hosted an [astonishing press conference](https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/trump-putin-meeting-us-russia-helsinki-finland-summit-live-updates-today-2018-07-16/?h_sid=45694f27d7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday** during which he refused to back his own intelligence team over Putin, blamed the United States for strained relations with Moscow, attacked Hillary Clinton, and smeared the FBI. A stunned [Anderson Cooper](http://www.businessinsider.com/anderson-cooper-slams-trumps-performance-in-putin-press-conference-2018-7?h_sid=45694f27d7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) spoke for all of us immediately afterwards when he called Trump’s performance “one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president at a summit in front of a Russian leader, certainly that I've ever seen."                            
            
**The backdrop for the press conference was a [U.S.-Russia summit in Helsinki, Finland](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/16/629424684/trump-putin-lead-press-conference-after-2-hour-meeting?h_sid=45694f27d7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), where Trump and Putin met privately for two hours,** just three days after Special Counsel Robert Mueller [indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers](https://crooked.com/newsletter/what-a-day-nyet-collusion/?h_sid=45694f27d7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) for stealing and leaking Democratic Party emails to help Trump win the presidency.                      
               
**Asked whether he sided with his own government or with Putin, Trump:**               
                        
- **Took [Putin’s side over his national security team](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/world/europe/russia-trump-putin-news-conference-transcript.html?h_sid=45694f27d7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), calling out Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats by name.** “My people came to me, Dan Coats came to me and some others, they said they think it’s Russia. I have President Putin; he just said it’s not Russia. I’ll say this: I don’t see any reason why it would be.”           
               
- **Called Mueller’s investigation a “[witch hunt](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/16/629462401/transcript-president-trump-and-russian-president-putins-joint-press-conference?h_sid=45694f27d7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),” and suggested the FBI and intelligence community** are conspiring to set him up and let Democrats off the hook.                    
                
- **Agreed in principle to a [ludicrous Putin proposal](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/16/17576788/putin-trump-meeting-election-idea-hacking?h_sid=45694f27d7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), under which Mueller would read Russian officials into his evidence against Russian hackers,** and Russia in turn would be allowed to interrogate FBI agents and American spies about alleged violations of Russian law. In other words: to give Putin visibility into a wide range of U.S. intelligence capabilities.

It was weak, but usually Ryan pretends to not see this stuff!                     
            
**Schumer made [four demands](https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/1018933358125043712) of Republican leaders:**                         
                
1. Stiffen U.S. sanctions on Russia;            
             
2. Demand that the national security team accompanying Trump to Helsinki “immediately” testify before Congress;                         
             
3. End their attacks on Mueller and the FBI;            
          
4. Demand that the 12 Russians named in Friday’s indictments be extradited to the U.S. to face trial.           
                 
**From Brian:** Today we saw the makings of a new corrupt bargain between Trump and Putin. Trump signaled his willingness to compromise U.S. intelligence and law enforcement operations at Putin’s request and in exchange will look the other way if and when Putin sabotages future U.S. elections on Trump’s behalf.

**Doubly Negative**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The White House and its allies spent Tuesday trying and failing to clean up the damage President Trump caused in Helsinki, Finland on Monday,** when he said he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin’s denials over the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election on his behalf.       
                 
**At a brief White House press availability, Trump [claimed he misspoke](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/24-hours-later-trump-claims-he-misspoke-helsinki-meant-say-n892166?h_sid=a9eb2f1f10-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84):** When he said, “I don't see any reason why it would be” Russia that interfered in the election, he really meant to say, “I don’t see any reason why it wouldn’t be” Russia that interfered in the election.                         
              
**Trump’s walkback was ludicrous because:**                    
               
- **It makes no sense in context.**            
         
- **He immediately contradicted himself again:** "I accept our American intelligence community's conclusion that Russia's meddling in the 2016 election took place,” he added. “Could be other people also. There’s a lot of people out there." Ain’t that the truth…                      
          
- **If Trump really misspoke, he would have clarified his comments immediately,** not over 24 hours later, and he wouldn’t have had to read the clarification from a script.                         
           
- **It’s the dumbest bullshit we have ever seen.**            
            
**At the same time, conservatives parroted White House talking points by [attributing Trump’s conduct to his egotism](https://www.axios.com/trump-putin-russia-helsinki-congress-intelligence-06a4c21e-59e5-419e-9f70-e88018c87bd2.html?h_sid=a9eb2f1f10-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84):** He refuses to acknowledge Russian meddling, [they say](https://crooked.com/article/the-legitimacy-excuse-for-trumps-russia-coverup-is-a-crock/?h_sid=a9eb2f1f10-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), because he worries it would tarnish his legitimacy.     
                  
**This justification is just as ludicrous because:**                       
           
- **Trump (or at least his campaign) knew the Russians were meddling on his behalf during the campaign,** and [publicly welcomed the help](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html?h_sid=a9eb2f1f10-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).                     
         
- **Trump was covering for Russian election meddling and other bad Russian acts before the election.**        
              
- **Denying that Russians did the meddling doesn’t enhance his legitimacy at all.** The damage to his legitimacy stems from the fact that someone committed crimes on his behalf, not from the specific identities of the criminals.                        
                   
**From Brian:** Both the justification and the clarification are absurd on their own terms, but they also are incompatible with one another. The White House is simultaneously arguing that Trump sided with Putin to defend his legitimacy, and that he didn’t actually side with Putin at all. Neither story checks out, and the failed effort to spin away Monday’s catastrophe only reinforces the more straightforward implication that Trump is compromised by the Russian government, and wants Putin to interfere on his behalf again.

**Tale of the (...) Tape**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump gave Republicans in Congress about 24 hours to pretend he’d fixed the [damage he did in Helsinki](https://crooked.com/newsletter/what-a-day-rot-in-helsinki/?h_sid=a3dd176fb6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** on Monday before saying a bunch of new and outrageous things that suggest there’s a corrupt relationship between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.                       
              
**Asked at a White House press availability on Wednesday whether Russia is still targeting U.S. elections,** [President Trump said, “no."](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/us/politics/trump-putin-higher-intelligence.html?h_sid=a3dd176fb6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) This is the second time in three days he’s contradicted his director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, to Putin’s benefit. On Friday, [Coats said](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/14/politics/director-of-national-intelligence-dan-coats-cyberattacks-russia/index.html?h_sid=a3dd176fb6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) “warning lights” of Russian cyberattacks are “blinking red.”                       
                   
**At her daily briefing, White House Press Secretary [Sarah Huckabee Sanders](http://www.businessinsider.com/white-house-press-briefing-sarah-huckabee-sanders-trump-russia-clarification-2018-7?h_sid=a3dd176fb6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) claimed that by “no,”** Trump meant he would take no questions (that’s not what he meant, he took multiple questions). Then she said Trump is [considering handing Americans](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/18/trump-russia-browder-mcfaul-questioning-731616?h_sid=a3dd176fb6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), including a former U.S. Ambassador, over to Russian law enforcement authorities to help Putin pursue his vendetta against a businessman named Bill Browder who exposed Putin’s corruption. This appears to be part of [a new quid pro quo arrangement](https://crooked.com/article/trump-and-putin-colluded-in-public/?h_sid=a3dd176fb6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) Trump and Putin discussed in private on Monday. (Imagine explaining this to people in 2014.)                      
           
**In a pre-recorded [interview](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/7/18/17585984/trump-nato-montenegro-russia-carlson?h_sid=a3dd176fb6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) with Fox News’s pledge master/preppy white nationalist Tucker Carlson,** Trump called Article Five of NATO—the linchpin of the treaty, which commits allies to a collective defense in the event of attack—into question. Destroying NATO is Russia’s top priority, and suggesting ambiguously that America might not rise to the defense of its allies sends the kind of mixed signals that could lead to a calamitous war.                                   
                
**From Brian:** If Republicans in Congress cared about anything other than pursuit of total power, the ones who took Trump’s absurd, disingenuous Tuesday walk-back at face value would be humiliated, and demanding real answers from the White House. Instead, they’ve [moved on to blocking](https://twitter.com/ChadPergram/status/1019629552656703489) legislative efforts to secure democracy from further Russian meddling. They’ve all known for a long time that there’s something deeply disturbing at the heart of the Trump-Putin relationship, they all know that allowing it to continue is extraordinarily dangerous, and they’ve all decided to let the rest of us live with the consequences.

**From Brian:** A bunch of Republicans must be pacing nervously tonight. This investigation is separate from, but clearly overlaps with, Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation.

**Russian to the Finish Line**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Donald Trump has [invited Vladimir Putin to visit the U.S. this fall](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/19/politics/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-summit/index.html?h_sid=6b7d24fd9a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), so that the crisis of the past week can replay itself, possibly before the midterm elections.** This news comes amid boasting from Moscow that Trump struck [multiple verbal agreements](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/as-russians-describe-verbal-agreements-at-summit-us-officials-scramble-for-clarity/2018/07/18/8bb1e96c-8aa7-11e8-a345-a1bf7847b375_story.html?h_sid=6b7d24fd9a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.f712d9ac23ec&amp;noredirect=on) with Putin—agreements that nobody in the United States government seems aware of because Trump met with Putin privately, accompanied only by an American interpreter. That interpreter’s name: Shmatamir Shmutin.                      
         
**In an interview at the Aspen Security Forum, Director of National Intelligence [Dan Coats](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-hes-looking-forward-to-second-summit-with-putin/2018/07/19/450a0424-8b59-11e8-8aea-86e88ae760d8_story.html?h_sid=6b7d24fd9a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.78530927f9a8)—the administration’s top intelligence officer—**acknowledged that he doesn’t know “what happened in that meeting” and that the Russians likely recorded it. He also learned during the interview that Putin will visit the U.S. in mere months, because the White House had not briefed him about it, marking the first communication failure in the history of Trump’s White House.     
                     
**Coats’s comments echo this [*Washington Post* report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/as-russians-describe-verbal-agreements-at-summit-us-officials-scramble-for-clarity/2018/07/18/8bb1e96c-8aa7-11e8-a345-a1bf7847b375_story.html?h_sid=6b7d24fd9a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.e764a744c98e) about “officials at the most senior levels across the U.S. military,”** who have been “scrambling since Monday to determine what Trump may have agreed to on national security issues in Helsinki,” but still have “little to no information.” This mirrors Trump himself, who also has “little to no information.”                         
              
**Democrats have responded to the chaos by demanding that the interpreter brief Congress and the intelligence community** about what happened in the meeting, but Republicans on Capitol Hill have [blocked their efforts](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-block-democrat-attempt-subpoena-trump-interpreter/story?h_sid=6b7d24fd9a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;id=56687970), because if Trump sold out the country, they don’t want to know about it. Republicans couldn’t remove their fingers from their ears to make a comment.                           
            
**On Wednesday, the *New York Times* published an [explosive article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/world/europe/trump-intelligence-russian-election-meddling-.html?h_sid=6b7d24fd9a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), which reported that intelligence community leaders briefed Trump before his inauguration** on their conclusion that Putin ordered the Russian attack on the election—a conclusion they based in part on a very sensitive human source close to the Russian president. The government is now left to wonder whether Trump betrayed that source, or why Trump invited Putin to the White House.                              
                  
**From Brian:** The absence of an official record of the Trump-Putin meeting feeds speculation, and the speculation will persist until Congress does its job and demands an account of the meeting. Today, a single Republican senator, [Tim Scott of South Carolina](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/19/17592120/ryan-bounds-tim-scott-trump-court-nominee-racism?h_sid=6b7d24fd9a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), derailed the confirmation of one of Trump’s judicial nominees for his past racist writing. That was the right thing to do, but this also underscores how complicit he and the rest of his GOP colleagues are in letting Trump compromise the security of the country in secret. They could get the answers the public deserves, but they don’t want to.

**Ken McGraw on Twitter: "[A new Papa John has been chosen](https://twitter.com/KenMcGraw/status/1019679425108029440)"***"No one really knows anything."—Jonathan Swan explaining his recent reporting from [inside the White House](https://www.mediaite.com/tv/nicolle-wallace-bursts-out-laughing-as-jonathan-swan-talks-wh-confusion-no-one-really-knows-anything/?h_sid=34dd3675a3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84). That's reassuring.*                     
                   
**Planet of the Tapes**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump and his former lawyer/fixer Michael Cohen discussed paying hush money to *Playboy* model/former Trump mistress Karen McDougal** to buy her silence two months ahead of the election. Today, we learned [Cohen recorded that conversation](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/20/us/politics/michael-cohen-trump-tape.html?pgtype=Homepage&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;h_sid=34dd3675a3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;action=click). Such a payment could constitute a felony under campaign-finance law, and the FBI is in possession of the tape. Hey, at least he found a way to get Helsinki out of the news.                             
             
**During the campaign, [McDougal sold her story](http://www.businessinsider.com/president-donald-trump-relationship-national-inquirer-mika-brzezinski-2017-6?h_sid=34dd3675a3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) about a 10-month affair she had with Trump in 2006 to the *National Enquirer* for** $150,000, but the Enquirer, whose owner is close friends with Trump, buried the story. At the time, the Trump campaign flatly denied having any knowledge of the payment, and Trump’s spokeswoman Hope Hicks called the affair allegation “totally untrue.” Extremely surprised that people close to Trump would lie.                      
                     
**On Friday, Trump’s criminal defense lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, confirmed that Trump and Cohen had discussed payments to McDougal,** but he told conflicting stories about it. In one version, Trump and Cohen discussed making a payment to McDougal directly. In another, they discussed buying the rights to her story from the *Enquirer*. Both versions could spell legal trouble for Cohen and, thus, Trump, but either way, Giuliani denied that Cohen or Trump ever made the payment, and spun the existence of this recording as “powerful exculpatory evidence.” When evidence emerges that Trump did make the payment, Giuliani will probably claim he meant to say “*in*culpatory evidence.” Tomato/to-mah-to, would/wouldn’t, etc.                    
             
**Cohen is apparently considering cooperating with the FBI, which is investigating Trump on multiple fronts.** On Friday, *TMZ* [reported](http://www.tmz.com/2018/07/20/manhattan-madam-kristin-davis-subpoenaed-robert-mueller-trump/?h_sid=34dd3675a3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has subpoenaed one of Roger Stone’s former associates (and erstwhile Manhattan Madam) Kristin Davis to testify in the Russia investigation, which appears to be closing in on Trump. If Cohen flips, his testimony will likely be of interest to Mueller as well as federal prosecutors in New York.                        
                 
**From Brian:** This week, the media and political establishment reluctantly began taking the possibility that Moscow has leverage over Trump, and is using it, seriously. It shouldn’t have taken so long, and Trump’s history of lying about his promiscuous use of hush money payments should have been a tip off. Trump has secrets, he goes to great lengths to keep them from becoming public, and there’s no reason some of them couldn’t be in the possession of hostile foreign governments.

Tl;dr It’s a great daily summary of the fuckery going on around us 
(perfect tl;dr from u/hyenaDeli)

Basically, the curator puts together all the major political stories into snippet style headlines, with some more detailed explanation and links to sources. The main ones for the day are generally about the Trump crime family, big political stories, or Trump-adjacent news. The Notables at the bottom are for other news stories that are less Trump-adjacent.

It's honestly a fantastic way to distill down the news of the day, and the creator runs it on crowd-funding. There's also a great community behind it that you can access by supporting him. I do, and I love it. My husband doesn't and he still loves the site.

Basically I'm doing an unabashed plug for this website that I have been privileged enough to watch grow from the ground up, from a hobby for Matt Kiser all the way to a full-time job that he loves with a community behind it intent on tearing down the bullshit.*"This girl Ocasio-Cortez or whatever she is."—[Rep.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump is exploring new ways to use his official powers to retaliate against people he perceives as his political enemies.**                            
                
**White House Press Secretary [Sarah Huckabee Sanders](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/23/politics/trump-security-clearances/index.html?h_sid=becb85975b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) announced during her daily briefing that Trump wants to strip the security clearances of former national security officials who have criticized him.** On Trump’s enemies list: former CIA Director John Brennan, former FBI Director James Comey, Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former NSA and CIA Director Michael Hayden, former national security adviser Susan Rice, and former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe. (Rosie O’Donnell doesn’t have a clearance.)                                
              
**All former heads of national security agencies like the CIA [keep their clearances](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/security-clearances-how-do-they-work/?h_sid=becb85975b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** so they can provide advice and expertise if asked. They don’t receive new classified information unless specifically authorized by the current administration, and there are no credible allegations that these individuals have leaked classified information or abused their clearances.                    
                 
**In other words, this is stupid.**                               
                
**Trump appears to have cooked up this plan alongside [Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY)](https://twitter.com/RandPaul/status/1021359932795482112),** who announced on Twitter that he would raise the idea of punishing Brennan with Trump.                       
              
**The “plan” seems mostly to be about creating news** that isn’t about a) whether Trump is [compromised by the Russian government](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/top-house-intel-democrat-president-acts-compromised-russian/story?h_sid=becb85975b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;id=56736305), or b) how federal prosecutors have a tape of him and his former lawyer [discussing an illegal hush money payment](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/20/us/politics/michael-cohen-trump-tape.html?h_sid=becb85975b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) to one of his former mistresses. At least two of the people on Trump’s enemies list, Comey and McCabe, have [already lost their security clearances](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/07/trump-maybe-revoking-comey-security-clearance-that-doesnt-exist.html?h_sid=becb85975b-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) because they were fired. And Sanders’ explanation for Trump’s desire to punish these critics is transparently disingenuous. She claims Trump is unhappy that his antagonists make what she called “baseless charges,” and that they are monetizing their government service—two sins Trump commits nearly every day of his presidency.                               
                 
**Coming on the heels of Trump’s [renewed attacks](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1021388295618682881) on Amazon and the *Washington Post*, and of a seriously unhinged [threat to attack Iran](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1021234525626609666),** and new lies about the origins of the Russia investigation, it makes sense to see this as part of a reported White House effort to distract the press from worse stories.                              
                
**From Brian:** This is a new and chilling abuse of power that shouldn’t be given short shrift just because other storylines are more politically damaging to him, or because his critics aren’t the most sympathetic bunch in the world. Trump is trying to consolidate power by letting everyone who works in government know they will be punished for criticizing him. It bears real resemblance to authoritarian abuses in (where else?) Moscow, and Republicans in Congress are cheering him on from the sidelines. The GOP is morphing into an authoritarian party before our eyes. It’s a big deal.

**Surprise: Betrayal Polls Terribly**

**[New polling](https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?h_sid=dacb0ad1b8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;ReleaseID=2557) today suggests that President Trump’s [betrayal of the country](https://crooked.com/newsletter/what-a-day-rot-in-helsinki/?h_sid=dacb0ad1b8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) in Helsinki last week has darkened the Republican Party’s midterm election outlook.**                                
                       
**The Quinnipiac poll, the first high-quality survey to be conducted entirely in the aftermath of Helsinki, finds 51 percent of respondents believe Russia has compromising information about Trump,** and that 49 percent feel embarrassed to have Trump as president—nearly twice as many as the 27 percent who say they are proud of him.                 
        
**Aggregate polling of Trump’s favorability has been relatively stable over the past several months,** but after a stretch of terrible news Trump is behaving even more defensively than usual, as if he knows his (and thus the GOP’s) position has slipped:                         
           
- **On Tuesday, Trump laughably [pretended that he *is* worried about Russia](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/398566-trump-im-concerned-russia-may-interfere-in-election-to-help-democrats?h_sid=dacb0ad1b8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) sabotaging the election again—to help Democrats.** This is the opposite of what his national security advisers are telling him, and the opposite of what Russian President Vladimir Putin said to the world in Helsinki. But it is something you might say if you a) worry about people thinking you’re compromised by Russia and b) think the elections are going to go badly for your party, and need an excuse.

(I don’t remember that from *Law &amp; Order*.) If Giuliani can push Mueller’s findings beyond November, Republicans will have one less potential political crisis to deal with on the campaign trail.                         
            
- **At the same time, the Trump administration announced it will spend $12 billion to [buy off farmers](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/us/politics/farmers-aid-trade-war.html?h_sid=dacb0ad1b8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** dealing with the direct economic consequences of Trump’s trade war—suggesting that Trump’s defensive maneuvers are also tied to his broader governing failures.                  
               
**From Brian:** At an event for veterans in Kansas City, MO, today [Trump told his supporters](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/398606-trump-what-youre-seeing-in-the-news-is-not-whats-happening-inbox-x?h_sid=dacb0ad1b8-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), “What you are seeing and what you are reading is not what’s happening.” It’s a chilling thing to hear a president say, but Trump wouldn’t be asking voters to disbelieve their eyes and ears if he didn’t need them to.

**CNN GOT THE TAPE! CNN GOT THE TAPE!**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**In September 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump and his then-fixer, [Michael Cohen](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/24/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump-tape/index.html?h_sid=b817f8dad3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), agreed to funnel $150,000 through a shell company** to assure that a politically damaging story about a 2006 affair Trump had with *Playboy* playmate Karen McDougal remained secret. (Remember that [book about Trump’s deep religious faith](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-downes-the-faith-of-donald-j-trump-20180301-story.html?h_sid=b817f8dad3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)? Remember that??)                    
            
**On Tuesday night, Cohen’s lawyer, Lanny Davis, released audio of that conversation, which Cohen secretly recorded at the time.** It confirms that Trump and his campaign lied egregiously and repeatedly about both the affair, and Trump’s efforts to bury it ahead of the election. It may even amount to [evidence of a criminal conspiracy](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/3/17314790/cohen-audio-tape-trump-giuliani-campaign-finance?h_sid=b817f8dad3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) to violate campaign finance law.                        
            
**In the conversation, Cohen advises Trump that he and Trump Organization CFO [Allen Weisselberg](https://heavy.com/news/2018/07/allen-weisselberg/?h_sid=b817f8dad3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) have created a plan** “to open up a company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend, David.”          
               
**In context, they appear to be devising a plan to obtain rights and source material for a story about the affair from *National Enquirer* owner [David Pecker](https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/25/media/david-pecker-american-media-inc-trump/index.html?h_sid=b817f8dad3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** who had purchased them from McDougal earlier that year.                      
              
**At issue is whether Trump knowingly authorized a financial transaction and whether the purpose of the transaction was to affect the outcome of the election.** Other parts of the audio make clear that the answer to both questions is yes.                         
           
- **When the two discuss the cost of the transaction, Trump volunteers, “what do we got to pay for this? 150?”** The *Enquirer* [reportedly paid](https://www.vox.com/2018/7/25/17610856/trump-cohen-tape-karen-mcdougal-explained?h_sid=b817f8dad3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) $150,000 to McDougal for her story.                 
         
- **Earlier in the conversation, the two men establish that they are discussing how to keep damaging stories out of the public eye.** Cohen informs Trump that he is fighting a *New York Times* legal effort to unseal the records of Trump’s divorce from his first wife, Ivana. Trump makes clear that his top priority is making sure that those records remain private at least until after the election.                        
             
**From Brian:** There is no reasonable doubt that Cohen and Trump were discussing ways to bury harmful stories before the election, and that they were planning to pay money to keep one such story out of the headlines. The only outstanding question is whether Cohen completed the transaction. We know he followed through with the hush money payment in the case of Stormy Daniels. It’s likely he did here, too. And if that’s the case, Trump is guilty of a felony.                     
             
**From Lovett:** ALSO IT’S ALL SO FUCKING GROSS.

Bolton is catching flack for referring to the investigation as a “witch hunt” but we want to know why he’s so confident about when Mueller will be done. Also, congrats John Bolton on this capstone to your career of shit.                  
            
**A federal court has ruled that [Maryland and Washington, DC, have valid claims against Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal-judge-allows-emoluments-case-against-trump-to-proceed/2018/07/25/c8070206-8fa4-11e8-8322-b5482bf5e0f5_story.html?h_sid=b817f8dad3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.c3cfbf9e2677)** stemming from his violations of the Emoluments Clause, an anti-corruption provision that prohibits government officials, including the president, from accepting foreign-government gifts and bribes. This is an important development that should allow plaintiffs’ lawyers access to Trump Organization books, to see how much money he’s currently raking in from foreign governments.                                   
          
**The White House is ending the long-held practice of publishing public summaries of [Trump's phone calls with world leaders](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/24/politics/foreign-leaders-call-white-house/index.html?h_sid=b817f8dad3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).** They could either have fewer corrupt and embarrassing calls with foreign leaders, or just keep them secret.

A Facebook spokesperson told *BuzzFeed* that Jones’s comments did not violate the company’s community standards, and were “not a credible statement of intent to commit violence,” suggesting yet again that avoiding bad-faith accusations of anti-conservative bias is more important to the company than basic decency and responsible behavior. In other news, [Facebook stock tanked](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/2018-07-25/facebook-inc-fb-stock?h_sid=b817f8dad3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) because it missed its revenue and usage targets.

O’Rourke’s campaign has previously reached out to Cruz about scheduling debates to no avail, and apparently Cruz’s team is not open to negotiating dates, locations, or topics. This is how someone who’s scared to debate acts when he’s more scared about what his internal polling says.

**So Much is Happening**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**First we heard the [secretly-recorded audio of Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/07/24/cohen-trump-audio-recording-cuomo-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/trump-lawyer-michael-cohen/?h_sid=80b684a68f-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) and Michael Cohen** conspiring to pay $150,000 to kill a news story about Trump’s decade-old affair with *Playboy* playmate Karen McDougal. Now comes the fallout, as the political world processes the possibility that this evidence of a felony is just the tip of the criminal iceberg.                       
             
**Here’s what happened on Thursday alone:**               
               
- **[Allen Weisselberg](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-organization-finance-chief-called-to-testify-before-federal-grand-jury-1532622947?h_sid=80b684a68f-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization has been subpoenaed to testify before the federal grand jury investigating Michael Cohen.** On the recording, Cohen names Weisselberg as a participant in a plan to purchase the rights and source materials to the McDougal affair story by funneling money to the owner of the *National Enquirer* through a shell company. (Isn’t it crazy that we’re used to seeing sentences like that?) But Weisselberg is said to know more about the Trump Organization than anyone else in Trump world, and that would include—just, you know, for instance—whether Trump owes large debts to Russian oligarchs.                        
           
- **Within the confines of campaign-finance law, [Michael Avenatti](https://twitter.com/MichaelAvenatti/status/1022382109535522816)—the lawyer representing Stormy Daniels,** who received pre-election hush money from Cohen *directly*—claims there are more women out there. “Donald Trump conspired with Michael Cohen to pay off multiple other women prior to Election Day in 2016,” Avenatti tweeted. “They were also concerned about a pregnancy. Cohen has evidence and info in his possession and it must be released to the public.” Avenatti loves attention, but he also has a habit of being right.                          
               
- **The *New York Times* reported that Special Counsel [Robert Mueller is scrutinizing Trump’s tweets](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/us/politics/trump-tweets-mueller-obstruction.html?h_sid=80b684a68f-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** in his efforts to determine whether Trump has tampered with witnesses in, or criminally obstructed, the Russia investigation. We knew that already, but that was before Trump’s criminal defense lawyer Rudy Giuliani said Trump would refuse to answer Mueller’s obstruction of justice questions. So Trump and Mueller appear to be headed for a showdown.                          
               
**From Brian:** 1. It’s tempting to see all developments on the Trump-legal front as signs that the walls are closing in on him, but this really does look like that. 2. I can’t believe I wrote all the words in this digest and they’re all true. It turns out electing an unrepentant liar and criminal president is messy. 3. Don’t obstruct justice on Twitter. (Just share news that confirms your biases, obviously.)

**These members have the power in theory to force a vote on this and other so-called “privileged” resolutions,** but have chosen not to, in part because [House Speaker Paul Ryan](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/26/ryan-rejects-conservative-push-to-impeach-rosenstein-743487?h_sid=80b684a68f-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) has come out against their effort publicly. Perhaps efforts to undermine Robert Mueller’s investigation look less appealing to Republicans now that Trump betrayed the country on television, and voters are starting to pay attention.

**Michael Cohen, Welcome the the Resis-HAHA, JK**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen now says he is [willing to testify under oath that Trump knew in advance](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/26/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump-june-2016-meeting-knowledge/index.html?utm_source=CNN+Five+Things&amp;utm_campaign=2fbd4528b2-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_07_27_07_31&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_6da287d761-2fbd4528b2-86393421) about, and approved, the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting** where his son, son-in-law, and campaign manager sought stolen dirt on Hillary Clinton from Russian agents. According to the same sources, Cohen also says he and “several” people were present when Donald Trump, Jr. informed his dad about the meeting.                              
                  
**You usually won’t go wrong not trusting Michael Cohen, who is an extremely dishonest person.**          
                    
**But if there’s one person who’s less trustworthy than Michael Cohen, it’s Donald Trump,** so when the two of them make irreconcilable claims, believing Michael Cohen isn’t necessarily crazy. Remember, the enemy of your enemy is your frienemy.                                  
                 
**Trump and his son [continue to deny](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/27/politics/trump-denials-trump-tower-2016-meeting/index.html) that Trump knew anything about the meeting,** which involved all of his campaign’s top principals, until well after the election. Don Jr. (who’s not NOT going to prison) even testified to it under oath. But their version of events is less credible than Cohen’s.                     
            
- **Multiple Trump insiders, including [Steve Bannon](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/03/donald-trump-russia-steve-bannon-michael-wolff) and [Sam Nunberg](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/03/05/ex-trump-aide-trump-may-very-well-have-done-something-during-the-election-with-the-russians/?utm_term=.ae9ff3c2533b&amp;noredirect=on), have publicly said they believe Trump knew** about the meeting at the time and is lying.                 
                  
- **Trump has lied serially about his [campaign’s Russia ties](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/03/connections-trump-putin-russia-ties-chart-flynn-page-manafort-sessions-214868), and now asks us to believe** that the truth just happens to coincide with the last possible version of events that spares him any guilt.                        
             
- **Cohen reportedly recognizes that [he’s past the point of no return](https://www.thedailybeast.com/dead-to-each-other-team-trump-prepares-to-bury-michael-cohen-weakling-and-traitor), telling associates there’s no going back,** and that “he expects to be finished with the president for the rest of his life.” Which, to us, sounds pretty fucking wonderful.                        
            
- **There’s no good hypothetical reason Cohen would put forth a wildly fabricated version of events,** and set a public expectation that he’ll testify under oath to a huge lie.                             
            
- **Trump loyalists, who see the writing on the wall, are now [test-driving](https://twitter.com/brianbeutler/status/1022722264683429889) the [shameful line](https://twitter.com/brianbeutler/status/1022932021436469250)** that colluding with Russian intelligence to beat Hillary Clinton wasn’t that bad.                                 
                           
**From Brian:** The most interesting thing about this development is that Cohen’s team is going public at all. When ABC’s George Stephanopoulos interviewed Cohen three weeks ago, Cohen declined to comment on the Trump Tower meeting “on advice of my counsel due to the ongoing investigation.” Cohen has a lot of legal jeopardy, and if he could, he would quietly trade this information to prosecutors in exchange for leniency. The fact that he apparently can’t suggests pretty strongly that Special Counsel Robert Mueller already knows that Trump green-lighted the Trump Tower meeting, that Cohen will face trial, and that he’s trying to gain public sympathy by taking aim at Trump.

**Ira on Twitter: "[I love when a Ronan Farrow alert hits](https://twitter.com/ira/status/1022875632047284224)"**I’m very pleased to be a corporate Democrat shill for neoliberalism, but I find the way Tommy, Dan, Jon, and Jon interact with each other really important and refreshing.

Dan and Favs are my favorites, but I can appreciate that they all see the broad goal of making the party big tent and inclusive of a swath of liberal ideas.Yes boys and girls and all those of genders I’m ignorant of, we have reached “collusion is not a crime”  anybody know who made this prediction first? I feel like it was Tommy. Also the administration is hedging now, they’re trying to soften a blow seemingly so given this switch in stance how close do we think Mueller is. I’ve always said this level of hedging would be an indicator that trump is being told that Mueller is closing in *"My client didn't do it, and even if he did it, it's not a crime."—[Rudy Giuliani](https://twitter.com/aidnmclaughlin/status/1023974964200914944) “defending” Trump on Fox.

**Objection: So What?**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump’s allies, including his criminal defense lawyer/guy who looks like he asks for a to-go box at a buffet, Rudy Giuliani, are test-driving a new defense.** Instead of denying that Trump and the Russians colluded, they’re arguing that [any such collusion wouldn’t be illegal](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/30/trump-lawyer-rudy-giuliani-collusion-is-not-a-crime.html?h_sid=baf6e605ab-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) and might not even be that bad.                   
                  
**In multiple cable-news appearances Monday, Giuliani entertained the possibility that Trump “colluded” with Russia,** but that because “collusion” is not a relevant legal term of art, he can’t be guilty of a crime.              
               
**“I have been sitting here looking in the federal code trying to find collusion as a crime. Collusion is not a crime,”** he said on Fox News.                           
               
**"I don't even know if that's a crime—colluding about Russians,” he [told CNN](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/07/30/rudy-giuliani-intv-mueller-not-sure-collusion-crime-sot-newday-vpx.cnn?h_sid=baf6e605ab-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).** “The hacking is the crime. The president didn't hack! He didn't pay them for hacking." Fun code of ethics!                              
                 
**In the [same CNN interview](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/07/30/rudy-giuliani-obliterates-the-goal-posts-on-trump-russia-collusion/?h_sid=baf6e605ab-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.9ddad1c3d9b2&amp;noredirect=on), he denied that Trump “participate[d] in any meeting about the Russia transaction.”** (Transaction is an interesting word! What was the transaction exactly?)                        
                     
**This line of argument has been gaining traction on the right,** including among elected Republicans.

**The right is preparing to defend Trump for having worked with the Russians to defeat Hillary Clinton** because Trump’s former fixer Michael Cohen seems to have turned on his former boss/father figure.           
             
**Cohen reportedly [is prepared to testify](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/26/politics/michael-cohen-donald-trump-june-2016-meeting-knowledge/index.html?h_sid=baf6e605ab-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) that Trump knew about the infamous Trump Tower meeting,** where Trump officials met Russian agents for dirt on Hillary Clinton, in advance, and approved it.                     
           
**According to Giuliani, [Cohen is pitching another story](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/399526-giuliani-rejects-purported-cohen-claim-of-second-trump-tower-meeting?h_sid=baf6e605ab-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), which places Cohen and other members of the campaign in a strategy session** to prepare for the meeting with the Russians.                         
               
**Giuliani has been traveling from cable studio to cable studio giving bonkers interviews** where he has a) called Cohen a liar and b) begun to lay the groundwork for new incriminating information about Trump to prove Cohen right. As he said today, "My client didn't do it, and even if he did it, it's not a crime." Rudy wants the media to treat the Trump-Russia conspiracy as normal politics. It’s not. And they know it! That’s why Trump and his allies have been lying about this meeting for a year.

From Crooked contributor Ben Rhodes: “President Trump isolated the US and sacrificed the high ground when he pulled out of the Iran Deal, despite the fact that his own intelligence community and Secretary of Defense said that Iran was complying and our closest allies were united in supporting the deal. Rather than erratic Twitter diplomacy, he’d be better off listening to his own experts and America’s allies by sticking to a deal that accomplishes the goal of preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and avoiding another war in the Middle East.”

"What's happening today," Trump said, "has really shown that I’ve been 100 percent right.”                                             
                  
**Late Breaking:** In an [official statement Monday night](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-israels-announcement-related-iranian-nuclear-weapons-development/?h_sid=8441c6ab9e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=wh&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter), White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Netanyahu’s presentation confirms that “Iran has a robust, clandestine nuclear weapons program that it has tried and failed to hide from the world.” The statement was false. Nuclear arms inspectors have certified Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal, and even Netanyahu acknowledged evidence in his presentation that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program years ago.                                           
              
**Amid fierce pushback, the White House attributed the confusion to a typo,** and that the statement was supposed to read, “Iran ***had*** a robust, clandestine nuclear weapons program.” It is good that they withdrew the statement, but their explanation doesn’t withstand scrutiny. The original statement uses the word “has” twice, strongly suggesting an intent to mislead the global public into believing Iran had covertly reactivated its nuclear weapons program in direct defiance of the agreement.                       
                 
**It should frighten everyone that not one but two nuclear negotiations are captive to Trump’s ego.**

**From Brian:** The White House Correspondents’ Dinner is a corrupt spectacle at its best. This weekend’s dinner harmed the media as an institution even more than usual by demonstrating that many journalists are so easily intimidated by bad-faith conservative criticism that they’ll abandon their professional mission—truth-seeking—when conservatives object to holding the Trump administration to account for its lies.

**Pop Quiz, Hot Shot**

**The *New York Times* [published a list of questions](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/us/politics/questions-mueller-wants-to-ask-trump-russia.html?h_sid=2e07f93d97-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) on Monday** that Special Counsel Robert Mueller reportedly told Donald Trump's lawyers he would like to ask the president. About one third of them are about contacts and cooperation between Trump’s inner circle and Russian agents. The rest are all hair questions. JK.                         
              
**Trump reacted to the development by [pretending those questions don't exist](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/white-house-frustrated-with-direction-of-mueller-questions?h_sid=2e07f93d97-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).** White House spokesman Raj Shah suggested that Trump has been cleared of collusion and that Mueller shouldn’t be allowed to investigate other crimes. Cool.                                              
                  
**From Brian:** It's very hard to read Mueller’s questions and see how the Russia investigation ends without several Trump associates indicted for crimes stemming from acts of collusion. The most natural interpretation of a few of the questions is that his some of his most senior aides—including Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort—committed crimes in the course of this corrupt partnership with Russia, and Mueller has the goods. But Trump may think he can get away with gaslighting the public about this, because he's already bamboozled the press corps into conceding the almost-as-brazen lie that there's "no evidence" of collusion.                                      
             
**Trump may *also* think that he can spin his way into avoiding an interview with Mueller, but if Mueller believes Trump’s testimony** is pivotal to his investigation, he has the power to compel it with a grand jury subpoena. On Tuesday night the *Washington Post* [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mueller-raised-possibility-of-presidential-subpoena-in-meeting-with-trumps-legal-team/2018/05/01/2bdec08e-4d51-11e8-af46-b1d6dc0d9bfe_story.html?h_sid=2e07f93d97-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.23a634eaea01&amp;noredirect=on) Mueller floated that possibility during a tense meeting with Trump’s lawyers last month.                               
                
**Also, Mueller’s team wants to delay disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s sentencing another [60 days](https://twitter.com/MarshallCohen/status/991421730865459201),** presumably because Flynn is still cooperating with him and that cooperation is bearing fruit. If we don’t write down all the crimes in 60 days or less, the pizza is free.

**The campaign centers on Benjamin Netanyahu’s evidence that Iran once had (and lied about) a covert nuclear weapons program,** which he’s offering Trump as a rationale for breaking the agreement that eliminated Iran’s nuclear weapons program (yes, you read that right).                                        
              
**Of course, the Obama administration and U.S. allies knew Iran hadn't been honest about its weapons program.** [Here, for instance](https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/obama-pitches-u-s-jews-on-iran-nuclear-deal-transcript/?h_sid=2e07f93d97-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), is President Obama telling the American Jewish community “we don’t trust Iran.” That is why the deal established a robust and intrusive inspections regime.                                            
                
**The White House took things one step further Monday night by issuing a false statement** claiming Iran's nuclear weapons program had been secretly reactivated. The National Security Council attributed the misstatement to a typo, but in full context [that explanation isn't credible](https://crooked.com/newsletter/day-hot-takes-snowflakes/?h_sid=2e07f93d97-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).                                          
              
**From Tommy Vietor:** After years of bashing US intelligence agencies for getting Iraq WMD wrong, Trump is now cooking up intel with the Israelis to push us closer to a conflict with Iran. A scandal hiding in plain sight.

**BREAKING**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**In an interview with [Sean Hannity](https://twitter.com/passantino/status/991856728454123520?h_sid=09504c80bb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), President Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani said Trump reimbursed Michael Cohen for the $130,000 in hush money he paid to Stormy Daniels,** to buy her silence about the affair she had with Trump in the last decade. This story is developing.                            
             
**Just What The Patient Ordered**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**We've learned more from [Dr. Harold Bornstein](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-doc-says-trump-bodyguard-lawyer-raided-his-office-took-n870351?h_sid=09504c80bb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)—President Trump's eccentric former physician—about the story** behind a seemingly illegal raid on his office by three Trump goons who made off with Trump's medical records last year. Turns out it was all innocent and cool. (It wasn’t.)                                     
              
**Bornstein believes Trump ordered his personal bodyguard to seize the records because he was unhappy** that Bornstein told a reporter he'd prescribed Trump a hair growth drug. He also admitted that [Trump personally dictated the contents of a notorious letter](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/01/politics/harold-bornstein-trump-letter/index.html?h_sid=09504c80bb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) Bornstein signed in 2015, giving Trump a clean bill of health during a stretch of the campaign when Trump and conservatives were [spreading propaganda](https://www.cnn.com/2016/10/11/politics/donald-trump-ad-hillary-clinton-health/index.html?h_sid=09504c80bb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) about Hillary Clinton's medical condition.
                                                     
                  
**That leaves two lingering questions:** Will there be an investigation of the altercation at Bornstein’s office? And will Trump be held to account for deceiving the nation? We won’t be holding our breath.                           
           
**Sometimes the unfairness of it all is hard to take!** Then you see a [video](https://twitter.com/RedTRaccoon/status/991430788276244480?h_sid=09504c80bb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) where you think, “good for TMZ,” and you realize life is not meant to be fair at all.

**We now know the questions were drawn up by one of Trump's criminal lawyers, Jay Sekulow,** based on an overview he received from the special counsel team. [Trump world orchestrated the leak](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mueller-raised-possibility-of-presidential-subpoena-in-meeting-with-trumps-legal-team/2018/05/01/2bdec08e-4d51-11e8-af46-b1d6dc0d9bfe_story.html?h_sid=09504c80bb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.c7194f4a6efd&amp;noredirect=on) in the hope of a) blaming Mueller's team for being behind the leak itself and b) creating the false impression that Mueller is asking questions he shouldn’t be asking.

They know more about the Trump campaign than anyone who ever worked there … They know what they are aiming at and are deadly accurate.” No collusion, indeed!                                                            
                      
**Anyhow, Trump's reluctance to be interviewed tees up a potential legal battle,** which the Supreme Court would have to decide, over whether a sitting president can be compelled to testify before a grand jury.            
                
**To get the White House on a war footing, Trump [pushed out Ty Cobb](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/us/politics/emmet-flood-ty-cobb-white-house-lawyer-special-counsel.html?h_sid=09504c80bb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;smid=pl-share), whose goal has been to avoid conflict with Mueller, and replaced him with Emmet Flood,** a veteran white collar criminal lawyer, who is reportedly prepared to do lengthy battle with Justice Department.                                                
               
**Meanwhile, Trump's corrupt disposition toward the Mueller investigation is helping to obstruct justice all on its own.** According to the *New York Times*, the [Ukrainian government ceased cooperating with Mueller](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/world/europe/ukraine-mueller-manafort-missiles.html?h_sid=09504c80bb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) and quashed its own investigation of Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort, shortly after the Trump administration agreed to sell the country missiles. Ukraine characterized this decision as one designed to stay on Trump's good side.

[The Hill on Twitter: "GOP lawmaker shares photo of middle schooler flipping him off"](https://twitter.com/thehill/status/991774844139253768)Hey fellow friends of the pod,

I'm trying to track down an episode of Lovett or Leave It where they played a game where the questions were so difficult that the audience participant was having a legitimately difficult time and even Lovett was surprised over how hard the game was. I wish I could remember what the topic was, but if it's any help, it wasn't a "Too Stupid to be True" format and it wasn't a lightning round; it was more of a "guessing who said the given quote" game. 

If anyone's got any recollection, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks so much!Checked out the Tommy John site then went back to my usual browsing. Coworker walked by and asked a question so i opened Chrome to look up whatever and bam, half naked dude rocking some TJ's.

**First Week Is Going Well, Emmet**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Last night, President Trump’s new lawyer Rudy Giuliani [told the world](https://twitter.com/passantino/status/991856728454123520?h_sid=c058b3ed93-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** that Trump not only knew about Michael Cohen’s hush money payment to Stormy Daniels—he also reimbursed Cohen for it, by "funneling" money through Cohen's legal practice. Huge news. Everything Trump and the White House said about the story was a lie.                                      
        
**Kind of a lot’s happened since then!**                                      
             
**Trump [confirmed the reimbursement to Cohen](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/991992302267785216) (and, thus, that he'd been [lying about it before](https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/992105296330936320))** on Twitter.                               
             
**Trump and Giuliani have insisted these payments [don’t violate campaign finance laws](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/us/politics/trump-michael-cohen-stormy-daniels-giuliani.html?pgtype=Homepage&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;h_sid=c058b3ed93-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;action=click)**—which may be true, but only because they probably violated campaign finance *disclosure* laws instead. You can’t funnel your own money into your campaign and not report it. Bad! Illegal!                                           
                 
**Trump's less rusty lawyers, Emmet Flood and White House Counsel Don McGahn, might have been able to stop all this damage,** but they never got a chance because [Giuliani didn't tell them](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/i-was-going-to-get-this-over-with-inside-giulianis-explosive-stormy-daniels-revelation/2018/05/03/6937ac52-4ee6-11e8-84a0-458a1aa9ac0a_story.html?h_sid=c058b3ed93-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.c1d680de1a75&amp;noredirect=on), or anyone but Trump, what he was going to do.                                       
          
**Giuliani also:**                       
                
• **Invented yet another excuse for Trump’s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey,** saying it was because Comey wouldn’t publicly state Trump wasn’t under investigation. The best legal arguments are born of improv.                                         
              
• **Compared FBI agents to Nazi stormtroopers.** Usually former federal prosecutors don’t do that.              
                    
• **Said that Attorney General Jeff Sessions,** "should, in the interest of justice, end this investigation." Fun definition of justice!                                       
              
**From Brian:** Things didn't go off the rails in the past 24 hours by accident. Trump and the people around him lie so much they can't keep track of which lies they've told whom. But after the Giuliani interview, Trump’s lies may have finally caught up with him.

**Today President Trump tried to sweep away the [enormous mess Rudy Giuliani made for him this week](https://crooked.com/newsletter/day-rudy-blowhard/?h_sid=f68c4a5fbc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** by [saying](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/04/politics/trump-giuliani-facts/index.html?h_sid=f68c4a5fbc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) Giuliani isn't "totally familiar with everything" but will "get his facts straight." Cool boss!                            
              
**Giuliani then issued a [dignity-crushing statement](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/giuliani-corrects-comments-on-daniels-hush-money-and-comey-firing?h_sid=f68c4a5fbc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** that didn’t really retract any of his potentially incriminating revelations about Trump. It said:                                        
        
• The hush money payment Trump made to adult film actress/[Twitter virtuoso](https://twitter.com/StormyDaniels/status/992394912388861952) Stormy Daniels through Michael Cohen would have gone forward "whether [Trump] was a candidate or not." (Daniels’ lawyer Michael Avenatti [says this is bullshit](https://twitter.com/brianbeutler/status/992251806007738368), and that he has receipts.)     
                     
• Giuliani was speaking out of turn when he suggested Trump knew about the payment at the time. (It *doesn’t* say Trump didn't know about the payment at the time.)                              
             
• Trump had the right to fire former FBI Director James Comey, and has been vindicated for it. (It *doesn't* say Trump wasn't trying to obstruct the Russia investigation.)                                      
                          
**Earlier this week, Giuliani said he would most likely advise Trump to [decline an interview](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-lawyer-ty-cobb-is-exiting-and-will-be-replaced-by-clinton-impeachment-attorney-emmet-flood/2018/05/02/96da63b8-4e26-11e8-84a0-458a1aa9ac0a_story.html?h_sid=f68c4a5fbc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.3d081974fb71&amp;noredirect=on) with Special Counsel Robert Mueller,** because Trump (who tweets angrily at the television all day) needs to focus on foreign policy. Trump laid that cover story to waste on Friday by saying [he wants to speak with Mueller very badly](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia/trump-says-he-cant-talk-to-mueller-unless-its-fair-idUSKBN1I51S6?h_sid=f68c4a5fbc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;il=0), but his lawyers think he shouldn’t because Mueller's team isn't "fair."                                                    
            
**Giuliani has been [stepping on rakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?h_sid=f68c4a5fbc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;v=2WZLJpMOxS4) all week,** and he’s basically [claimed that Trump gives Cohen lots of money every month](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/us/politics/trump-michael-cohen-stormy-daniels-giuliani.html?h_sid=f68c4a5fbc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) and Cohen uses that money to make Trump's problems go away. Bada bing bada boom. Unfortunately, that would probably implicate Trump in all the crimes Cohen committed on his behalf. Through a friend, [Cohen said](https://www.thedailybeast.com/friend-michael-cohen-says-rudy-giuliani-doesnt-know-what-hes-talking-about?h_sid=f68c4a5fbc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) Giuliani "doesn't know what he's talking about." A source who has worked with Trump's lawyers [told *Politico*](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/03/trump-lawyers-mueller-russia-probe-strategy-568481?h_sid=f68c4a5fbc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), "The public strategy has now subsumed the legal strategy.” At least the public strategy is working though?                                              
           
**Do these people know you don’t have to go on Fox News?**                                        
          
**What Else**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The Trump administration has [rescinded the temporary protected status](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/04/politics/immigration-tps-honduras/index.html?h_sid=f68c4a5fbc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) that has allowed 86,000 Hondurans to work and live in the U.S.** since a hurricane destroyed much of the country in 1998. They now have 18 months to either seek legal residency in the U.S., or return to Honduras. This brings the total number of people whose temporary protected status has been ended by the Trump administration up to 425,000.                                
                
**A Reagan-appointed federal judge in Virginia [grilled one of Robert Mueller’s deputies](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/04/judge-in-paul-manafort-case-criticizes-robert-mueller-probe.html?h_sid=f68c4a5fbc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** accusing Mueller of not “really car[ing] about [Paul] Manafort’s bank fraud,” and only caring “about what information he might give you about Mr. Trump and what might lead to his impeachment or prosecution.” Trump turned right around and [touted the judge’s bluster](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/386287-trump-gives-freewheeling-political-address-to-nra?h_sid=f68c4a5fbc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) at an NRA rally in Dallas. Great job, judge.                            
                   
**Iowa’s governor signed the [nation’s most restrictive abortion ban into law](https://www.wsj.com/articles/iowa-governor-to-sign-six-week-abortion-ban-legislation-1525463781?h_sid=f68c4a5fbc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).** Planned Parenthood of Iowa and the ACLU have said [they will sue the governor](http://www.kcci.com/article/reynolds-to-sign-6-week-abortion-ban-into-law/20164560?h_sid=f68c4a5fbc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) over this bill.

When will he get some perks???                                       
              
**What a condo! Senate Banking Committee chairman Mike Crapo (R-ID) has held 78 campaign events in the [same lobbyist-owned condo](https://www.thedailybeast.com/senate-banking-chair-mike-crapo-set-up-campaign-shop-in-scott-pruitts-lobbyist-pad/?h_sid=f68c4a5fbc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** Pruitt was paying submarket rent to live in. The owners of the condo represented firms that had business before Crapo’s committees, which should honestly not surprise anyone at this point. Anyway, life is good at 666 Swamp Lane.

Pena contends Jackson violated Karen Pence’s medical privacy and that Jackson tried to intimidate Pena when she confronted him about it.                            
                     
**The literature world was hit with two major sexual abuse related allegations today.** First, it was announced that the Nobel Prize in Literature [won’t be awarded this year](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/world/europe/nobel-literature-swedish-academy.html?h_sid=f68c4a5fbc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes) because the Swedish panel that selects the winner has been embroiled in a sexual abuse scandal. Instead, the panel will name two winners next year. Also, Pulitzer prize winning author [Junot Díaz was accused of sexual misconduct](https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/author-junot-diaz-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-verbal-abuse.html?h_sid=f68c4a5fbc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) and verbal abuse by multiple women, weeks after [his own story](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/16/the-silence-the-legacy-of-childhood-trauma?h_sid=f68c4a5fbc-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) of being raped as a child and his ensuing trauma was published.

• Defy a subpoena if Special Counsel Robert Mueller issues one.                         
             
• Plead the fifth amendment if forced to testify.                         
           
• Have "funneled" more hush-money payments to women through Michael Cohen.                       
          
**Giuliani also revealed that the Trump team is still trying to interfere with the Mueller investigation,** complaining that Mueller's team won't provide Trump a memo outlining the scope of his investigation. Don’t ever change, Rudy!                                      
                 
**From Brian:** Trump and Giuliani appear to be priming Trump's supporters to expect and accept the worst, including a refusal to testify. This would defy a norm that applies to most public employees: innocent or guilty, they can plead the fifth as the Constitution allows, but, [as explained here](https://www.govexec.com/oversight/2014/03/lawyers-examine-pleading-fifth-federal-employee/80179/?h_sid=7e160db01e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), they can't expect to keep their jobs if they do. It’s a matter of public accountability and that standard should apply to the president, too. Trump wants to bust through that norm, and the battle for narrative control over whether he should be allowed to or not begins now.                  
                              
**Blanken-Shipwreck**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Republicans are freaked out over polling that suggests [Don Blankenship](http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/386498-polls-show-blankenship-ahead-sparking-panic-among-gop?h_sid=7e160db01e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** the racist coal baron who [spent time in prison](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/west-virginias-joe-manchin-is-vulnerable-but-will-the-gop-blow-its-chance/?h_sid=7e160db01e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) for costing 29 miners their lives, might win the West Virginia GOP Senate primary on Tuesday.                                                 
                   
**Their objection to Blankenship doesn’t stem from his felony record or bigotry,** per se, but a concern that he’ll lose the general election.                                
              
• “I hate to lose. So I'm gonna go out on a limb here and ask the people of West Virginia to make a wise decision and reject Blankenship!...” —[Don Jr.](https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/992127873405341696)                              
            
• “To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can’t win the General Election in your State...No way!” —[Donald Trump](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/993443781281271808)         
                            
**This is exactly how the Alabama Senate special election began.** In the primary, Trump endorsed establishment-favorite Luther Strange. When Strange lost, he threw his support behind pedophile-bigot Roy Moore in the general. If Blankenship becomes the GOP nominee, it would be completely in character for Trump and the RNC to throw their support to him, and for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to spend months in hiding. The voters of West Virginia may face a test that the voters of Alabama just barely passed.                   
                                                 
**From Crooked contributor [Tim Miller](https://twitter.com/Timodc/status/993511594582671360?h_sid=7e160db01e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84):** People “in politics” think Trump half-heartedly endorsing Strange/dinging Blankenship matters because they have deluded themselves about Trump and the base. Trump unleashed a noxious, hateful monster. And the voters who liked it can sniff who his real heir is, endorsement or not.

**Gina Haspel's nomination to run the CIA [nearly fell apart over the weekend](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gina-haspel-nominee-to-head-cia-sought-to-withdraw-over-questions-about-her-role-in-agency-interrogation-program/2018/05/06/eaa9b990-50dc-11e8-af46-b1d6dc0d9bfe_story.html?h_sid=7e160db01e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.63618a3264eb).** Here’s the tick tock:                               
               
**Late last week, officials summoned Haspel to the White House after discovering information about her role in the Bush torture program** that they weren’t aware of and which they worried could present an obstacle to her confirmation.                             
                
**Haspel later broached the idea of withdrawing** to avoid further embarrassing herself and the CIA.             
                     
**On Friday night, senior White House aides raced to CIA headquarters to convince Haspel not to back out,** and over the weekend she decided to continue the confirmation process.                          
                  
**It would be great if Haspel's nomination fails one way or another.** But it's also a huge problem that the White House is nominating people to critically important jobs without knowing much about them.                    
                 
**From [Rear Admiral John Hutson and Boise State University professor Steven Feldstein](https://crooked.com/article/grill-gina-haspel/?h_sid=7e160db01e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84):** If Haspel’s nomination can’t be defeated, her confirmation process represents one of the few opportunities for skeptics to lay out their concerns and attempt to limit the damage her directorship may inflict.

&gt;We're surrounded by the implications of wealth concentration, all the time, in ways big and small, and I think this is one of those where you look at it and say, there are people out there who have enough money and have enough power that they're willing to devote resources to things like that, because there's so much concentrated wealth in so few hands that these people believe that they can wield this kind of power in our political system... And ultimately whether that's somebody with, somehow, financial interests that will benefit from the removal of the [Iran] deal, versus someone with just a political interest in destroying the deal, I don't think it ultimately matters, it's that we as a society have to say that this is just beyond the bounds, we just don't dig into the personal lives of people who were in government in the past to discredit them or destroy them in some way for political purposes.

**Awful President Makes Huge Mistakes**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump officially withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear deal on Tuesday** thumbing his nose at the United States' closest allies, and cementing the power of the [newest members of his national security team](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/04/iran-nuclear-deal-bolton-trump-regime-change/558785/?h_sid=4fa478df55-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), who have angled for war with Iran for years.                                    
              
**What you need to know:**                                   
            
**After well over a year on the job, Trump seems to have no idea what the Iran deal actually did,** and has formed no contingency plans for any of the potential consequences of leaving the agreement, including dire ones: Iran may restart its nuclear weapons program, allies and major trading partners [may defy U.S. sanctions](https://twitter.com/awprokop/status/993890078329131008), global trust in the U.S. government is almost certain to collapse further, and nuclear diplomacy with North Korea may unravel. (From Tommy: 🤢)       
                          
**Trump is justifying his decision with outright lies, [including the claim](https://twitter.com/jimsciutto/status/993917947386187777) that Iran "is pursuing" nuclear weapons.** Big fat lie. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed that Iran was in compliance with the deal during his confirmation hearing last month. This brazen, wilful dishonesty comes just days after reports surfaced that the White House enlisted foreign spies to run black ops on prominent Iran deal supporters. They lacked a persuasive substantive case for unilaterally withdrawing, so they've tried to fabricate one.                              
               
**The truth is as simple as it is depressing: Trump only opposes the Iran deal because Obama signed it.** He doesn’t understand or care about the security implications, and his neocon aides were more than happy to go along for the ride.                                       
                  
**It remains to be seen how this plays out in Iran, or what it will mean for nuclear diplomacy with North Korea.** Trump just told the world he thinks swapping reversible sanctions relief for disarmament and strict inspections is a bad idea, and shown that he's liable to violate such agreements in response to imagined provocations. Who knows what Kim Jong-un will make of it?                                              
                  
**This could turn out to be one of  the single most consequential decision of Trump's presidency,** and it's a monumental error that nobody can defend on the merits. Donald Trump should not be president.

**The emails reveal that Pruitt fast-tracked a California cleanup project near Hewitt’s home,** essentially at Hewitt’s behest. Hewitt [responded to the revelation](https://twitter.com/hughhewitt/status/993889777006141440?h_sid=4fa478df55-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) by admitting to the quid pro quo arrangement, and calling it a non-story.            
              
**More emails underscore the fact that, on top of being insanely corrupt,** Pruitt is a coward who [panics anytime he thinks a reporter might be nearby](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/climate/epa-pruitt-emails-secrecy.html?h_sid=4fa478df55-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)—often because he's worried the reporter will catch him in ethically compromising situations. The details here are truly incredible.                                   
                    
**Meanwhile some White House aides are [urging Trump to fire Pruitt](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/climate/trump-fire-pruitt-epa.html?h_sid=4fa478df55-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** in large part because Pruitt is at the center of about a dozen investigations, and they realize it's going to look extremely bad when a cabinet member with Trump's full support gets frog marched out of his office. These officials predict Trump might change his mind about Pruitt "within weeks" (very cool code of ethics) when he can be safely replaced with an equally industry-friendly EPA chief.

They were there fairly recently.*"Gotta do it, he has no choice"—‘98 [Rudy Giuliani](https://twitter.com/RogueFirstLady/status/994210240106287104) on whether presidents have to testify if subpoenaed* 🤔                             
                 
**Under The Table And Scheming**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Michael Cohen [accepted money through the same LLC](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/5/9/17336856/michael-cohen-novartis-att-shell-company?h_sid=8576d5a526-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) he created to pay off Stormy Daniels from at least two multinational corporations and one Russian oligarch,** according to a [memo published by Daniels’ lawyer](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2l7qztjakjpqcdl/Executive%20Summary.pdf?h_sid=8576d5a526-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;dl=0), Michael Avenatti, which was later confirmed by multiple news outlets. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is [reported to have investigated](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/08/politics/robert-mueller-russian-oligarch-payments-michael-cohen/index.html?h_sid=8576d5a526-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) these aspects of Cohen’s LLC independently. Oh no—more weird, suspicious, crime-esque behavior!                                        
                    
**This news could merge all of President Trump’s corruption scandals into one cosmic corruption scandal,** where drug companies, telecom giants, and Russian oligarchs were essentially paying bribes to Cohen in order to gain access to Trump. What’s more, the government may have indirectly (and perhaps unintentionally) substantiated the corrupt arrangement by announcing the Treasury Department’s inspector general will investigate the [possible leak of Michael Cohen’s bank records](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/treasury-inspector-general-launches-probe-into-possible-leak-of-michael-cohens-banking-records/2018/05/09/d33c2010-5391-11e8-b00a-17f9fda3859b_story.html?h_sid=8576d5a526-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.6aba04ec414c), which Avenatti would have needed to compile his memo.                              
          
**From Brian Beutler:** The Constitution lists bribery as an impeachable offense. Much of the money that came in to Cohen’s LLC is unaccounted for at this moment. What if it went directly to Trump or the Trump organization?

She testified categorically that she would not reimpose the Bush era detention and interrogation program. To make it seem as if she would keep the CIA well clear of any lines of impropriety, Haspel [said](https://twitter.com/shaneharris/status/994224383601324032), "I would not allow [the] CIA to undertake activity that I thought was immoral even if it was technically legal." But in response to questions from multiple Democrats, and a [particularly effective grilling](https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedNews/status/994241607481217024) by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Haspel refused to say whether she believes the torture program itself was immoral. She promised not to authorize anything immoral, but without defining the scope of what she finds immoral, she effectively promised nothing.

He’s actually [running for governor](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/ohio-primary-voters-pick-candidates-for-one-of-the-years-biggest-governor-races/2018/05/08/2c2f6178-52c5-11e8-a551-5b648abe29ef_story.html?h_sid=8576d5a526-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.76e56333e119), which OF COURSE we knew. OUR BAD.I use the Google Music app podcast section for my podcasts and the PSA pod hasn't updated a new episode since last Monday(Tuesday)'s pod. PSW, WFLT, LIOLI and everything else seem to be updating, but PSA isn't. 

Anyone else having the same issues? 

I also tried to search for the pod instead of just going through "my subscriptions" and that isn't updated also, which has worked in the past. *"I'm crushing it"—[Michael Cohen](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mueller-questioned-payment-to-trump-lawyer-michael-cohen/2018/05/09/6ad3a7d6-538d-11e8-a551-5b648abe29ef_story.html?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.2fa6d243d265&amp;noredirect=on) (c. 2017)*
                                           
           
**Enhanced Capitulation Techniques**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**There will be, [at most, 50 Republican votes](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/09/politics/whip-list-senators-gina-haspel-cia-director/index.html?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) for Gina Haspel, President Trump’s designated CIA director,** and a key player in the Bush administration torture program.     
                         
**In a statement Wednesday, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) [called on the Senate](https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;ID=9BF25289-D798-47B9-A30D-9494C6022EF8) to reject her nomination.** “Ms. Haspel’s role in overseeing the use of torture by Americans is disturbing," he said. "Her refusal to acknowledge torture’s immorality is disqualifying.” H/T to [Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA)](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6j6wte?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) for asking a hard question with an easy answer.                                          
                   
**On Thursday, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) [wrote to Attorney General Jeff Sessions](https://www.flake.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/0c1dec01-7197-4e73-abc7-8dc104a7f27e/05.10.2018-letter-to-ag-sessions.pdf?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) urging him to give senators unfettered access to a Justice Department report** on the CIA’s destruction of torture videotapes, and Haspel’s role in it.                                             
           
**This nomination is only a lock if every Republican other than McCain—including Flake—ultimately falls into line.** If they don’t, then Haspel can only be confirmed with Democratic votes. So far only one Democrat, Sen. Joe Manchin (WV), has announced he supports Haspel’s confirmation, but his vote would be decisive if all Republicans other than McCain and Flake rally behind her. Most Trump cabinet nominees have racked up a few Democratic votes, but those votes have always been surplus. It’ll be an enormous failure and a lasting stain if Democrats are given the opportunity to sink a torturer’s nomination but fail to do so.                                    
                
**Living Life While Black**

**On Tuesday, a white Yale graduate student [called the police on a black Yale graduate student](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/09/us/yale-student-napping-black-trnd/index.html?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** she found napping in a common room in the school’s Hall of Graduate studies. When campus police showed up to interrogate her, she identified herself as Lolade Siyonbola and began streaming the incident on Facebook Live. The officers questioned her for nearly 20 minutes, even after she proved she lived in the building.                                  
                
**A [Yale official said](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/387121-yale-reviewing-response-to-white-student-calling-police-on?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) the university will be “reviewing the call and the response** of the police officers to ensure that the proper protocol was followed and to determine if there was anything we could have done better.” We imagine this won't be hard.                
                        
**One month after the April arrests of Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson in a [Philadelphia Starbucks drew nationwide attention](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/19/603917872/they-can-t-be-here-for-us-men-arrested-at-philadelphia-starbucks-speak-out?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** a very similar story is capturing the country’s imagination, but for many people of color in this country, racial bias is a daily, not monthly problem.

Do I appear angry? Am I walking in front of white people rather than behind them in the street? Do I have cash on me to buy something before I ask the cashier can I use the bathroom?... These are the respectability politics of how black people are often forced to conduct themselves in society. It's not by choice, but by obligation. It could in many ways be the difference between being free or imprisonment, of staying alive or facing death.”                                      
                  
**Lyin' Devin**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**House Intelligence Committee chairman/midnight avenger Devin Nunes (R-CA) [tried to force the Justice Department to out a CIA and FBI informant](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/risk-to-intelligence-source-who-aided-russia-investigation-at-center-of-latest-showdown-between-nunes-and-justice-dept/2018/05/08/d6fb66f8-5223-11e8-abd8-265bd07a9859_story.html?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) working with Special Counsel Robert Mueller** (placing lives at risk) to help Trump cover up whatever he's covering up.                                             
                 
**When [confronted about this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nunes-subpoena-to-justice-dept-requested-all-documents-about-individual-described-as-longtime-intelligence-source/2018/05/09/93fbc154-53c2-11e8-9c91-7dab596e8252_story.html?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.1945e1fc4193) by the *Washington Post*, Nunes, referring to the Justice Department said,** “I’ve never referenced an individual. They did. They did that. I didn’t." (The subpoena he sent to the Justice Department literally requested “all documents referring or related to the individual referenced in Chairman Nunes’ April 24, 2018 classified letter to Attorney General Sessions.”) Devin Nunes is bad at lying.                                                 
            
**Though Nunes and DOJ reached an accommodation that allowed him to view documents in a secure setting,** the intelligence community believes Nunes is pushing for these documents from the Mueller investigation so that he can give them to Trump. (No shit!) Having overseen the complete breakdown of trust between intelligence agencies and the intelligence committee, House Speaker Paul Ryan [gave Nunes the green light](https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/994605930959572994) to continue the coverup. Gross!           
                 
**Also, [Vice President Mike Pence](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/10/politics/mike-pence-robert-mueller-investigation/index.html?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) "would very respectfully encourage the special counsel and his team to bring their work to completion."** Pence added, "In the interest of the country, I think it's time to wrap it up." Earlier this month, Pence also called [Sheriff Joe Arpaio](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-champion-of-the-rule-of-law-pence-praises-pardoned-arizona-sheriff-joe-arpaio/2018/05/02/b8ae812c-4e0d-11e8-84a0-458a1aa9ac0a_story.html?h_sid=c29568179c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), whom Trump pardoned for criminal contempt of court, a champion of the rule of law.

Trump will meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un [in Singapore on June 12](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/994587349718847489).

Heaven forbid anyone mention a smokey eye!

He has has not only abandoned that commitment, but is doing his level best to make sure Congress doesn’t even try, and it is driving many pro-Dream Act Republicans into retirement. Trump’s nativism isn’t dividing the GOP. It’s what’s holding it together.

&gt; -- **YES**, guys like Michael Cohen routinely get paid amounts like $1.2 million to offer insights about their boss or former boss. Yeah, it’s crazy. But many readers of this newsletter would not have their McMansion in McLean, their BMW, their membership at Army Navy, second homes in Delaware, cigar lockers and endless glasses of Pinot Noir at BLT Steak and Tosca if that kind of stuff didn’t happen. Newsflash: $1.2 million is not even a rounding error for massive corporations. (The smart companies route these deals through law firms.)    
                               
This argument, which has echoed across the commentariat:                         
                       
1. **Is mostly wrong.** Yes, our political system allows people to trade connections for more money than they deserve, and features plenty of legal corruption. But to suggest it’s commonplace for presidents to create systems of enrichment for personal lawyers (or children) who have no functional knowledge of politics or policy—or that influence peddlers frequently pocket over a million dollars simply for meeting with corporate officers—is horseshit. Trump has introduced Washington to new frontiers of corruption.                    
                 
2. **Underscores just how poor a job the Washington press corps does explaining the politics industry to readers and viewers.** People are outraged about the Cohen scandal, and if your response to them is “Forget it, Jake, it’s Chinatown,” you’re doing it wrong on a couple levels.

[Ashley C. Ford on Twitter: "I’m just here to share the things that bring me joy"](https://twitter.com/iSmashFizzle/status/994690832384045056)For me, the recent discussions on confirming/not confirming Gina Haspel has got me thinking. I used to be very sympathetic toward red\-state Dems voting with the GOP on certain issues because of the reflection it has on the voters in their states, and because it's better to have a conservative\-leaning Dem than it is to have a total right\-wing looney. And to some extent, I still think it's okay for Dems to vote conservative on certain policy issues that may be popular in their state, such as voting against gun control measures and in favor of pro\-life measures \(to some extent\). However, when it comes to issues like confirming problematic cabinet members, Dan has been making a really good point. Republicans are not suddenly going to be cool with their Dem lawmaker because they voted to confirm a Trump nominee. At least, not enough to want to vote for them in November. I now think that no Dem has an excuse to vote in favor of Gina and most Trump nominees.*"Why does everyone say Karate?

**Today a delegation representing President Trump, led by Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, [officially opened the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-44116340?h_sid=5de310fd93-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), as protests raged nearby in Gaza.** Israeli soldiers [killed at least 55 Palestinian protesters](https://twitter.com/sharifkouddous/status/996134511518928896) and injured over 2,700 more, creating [a humanitarian nightmare](https://twitter.com/eugenegu/status/996058031140978689).                                       
            
**Few issues are more diplomatically sensitive than the question of where the Israeli and Palestinian capitals will be located,** and the reaction to today’s move broke down along familiar lines. Many Israelis view moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem as simply an acknowledgment that Jerusalem is Israel’s capital, but Palestinians, who view Jerusalem as their capital as well, see the move as proof that the U.S. is not an honest broker in what’s left of the Middle East peace process.

**Nuking The Goalposts**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The Trump administration has [very rapidly moved the goalposts](http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/14/security-brief-unclear-u-s-demands-on-north-korea-iran-deal-fall-out/?h_sid=5de310fd93-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) for gauging the success of its nuclear diplomacy with North Korea.**                             
             
**Just a few days ago, North Korean officials [committed to the complete denuclearization](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/14/17352056/north-korea-news-trump-bolton-pompeo-nuclear?h_sid=5de310fd93-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) of the peninsula and even the exile of nuclear physicists and engineers from North Korea.** But this weekend, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo [reset expectations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/05/14/is-the-administration-backing-off-trumps-demand-that-north-korea-get-rid-of-its-nukes/?h_sid=5de310fd93-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.cd9d0fa78324&amp;noredirect=on) at the destruction of North Korea's biological and chemical weapons stockpiles only. “If [North Korea does] the things we need to do so that America is no longer held at risk by your nuclear weapons arsenal, and that you get rid of your [chemical and biological weapons] program and missiles that threaten the world,” Pompeo said, “we will ensure that your people have the opportunity for the greatness that I know Chairman Kim wants them to have.”                        
                 
**In other words, the administration has defined denuclearization down to meaninglessness.** In exchange for establishing an inspection regime that verifies North Korea’s warheads can't reach targets in the U.S., Pompeo suggested the United States would be willing to ease sanctions on the North Korean regime.                            
              
**If this sounds like a shittier version of the Iran deal, it's because that's exactly what it is.**                          
                       
**Inconsistencies like these arise from the fact that Trump seems to make enormously consequential foreign policy decisions** based on crude assessments of whether they will help him dominate cable news cycles, win praise from foreign leaders at big public ceremonies, or heal a psychic wound by attacking the legacy of Barack Obama.

**From Brian: These Senate Democrats had the power to deny Haspel the CIA directorship**—to make a powerful statement that the U.S. government has at long last decided it will not promote architects and leaders of the torture regime, even under GOP rule. They even had cover from Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), who was tortured as a POW in Vietnam and opposes Haspel. But they declined to do so. Bafflingly, Heitkamp [even cited](http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/387803-heitkamp-backs-haspel-to-lead-cia?h_sid=27253445de-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) McCain's principled stance in her statement announcing that she will be voting a different way. Though most Democrats will surely vote against confirming Haspel, vulnerable Democrats and party leaders have apparently not learned anything about how politics has changed in the past decade or two.

**Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley [published 2,500-plus pages of documents](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/16/gop-led-senate-committee-releases-2556-page-report-on-trump-tower-meeting.html?h_sid=53ac2d01e4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) stemming from the committee’s inquiry into the Trump campaign** and Russian subversion of the 2016 election.                      
              
**The documents are pretty damning!** They include a transcript of the committee’s interview with Donald Trump Jr. regarding that wonderful June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner, and a handful of Russian spies as well as new details about the Trump team’s efforts to cover it up.                 
                          
**Junior [admitted](https://twitter.com/ThePlumLineGS/status/996749347508408320) that his father helped craft the statement he issued lying to the public** about the purpose of the meeting.                        
            
**He [also told the committee](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/05/16/trump-tower-meeting-transcripts-donald-jr-russia-lawyer-downplay-session-rip-apocalyptic-hollywood-narrative.html?h_sid=53ac2d01e4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) that he accepted the meeting in part because, at the time, “there was no focus on Russian activities that there is today,”** suggesting he didn’t realize that Russia was attempting to intervene in the election. By June 2016, Russian spies had already approached the campaign offering dirt on Hillary Clinton. Trump Jr. was so primed to accept dirt on Clinton from the Russians that, according to one of Russians in attendance, he began the meeting by saying: "So you have some information for us?"

**Kim Jong-Unclear**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**North Korea is [threatening to cancel a planned summit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/north-korea-threatens-to-cancel-summit-with-trump-over-military-drills/2018/05/15/04a15a5e-5878-11e8-8b92-45fdd7aaef3c_story.html?h_sid=53ac2d01e4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.6f2a2c6c98f3&amp;noredirect=on) between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un,** citing its distrust of Trump’s national security adviser, [John Bolton](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/16/politics/north-korea-john-bolton-libya-comments/index.html?h_sid=53ac2d01e4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), and his insistence that North Korea must commit to complete, verifiable, irreversible disarmament. Predictable twist!                                
              
**Nonproliferation experts have speculated that Bolton has been publicly pushing a very hard line in the hope of sabotaging the diplomatic process,** as he did in the last decade under George W. Bush. At a minimum, Bolton has been citing Libya’s former leader Muammar Qaddafi as an example of what denuclearization in North Korea might look like. About a decade after giving up his nuclear program, Qaddafi was deposed by NATO and killed in the streets by rebel fighters. So, ya know, maybe not the best way to describe things to Kim Jong-un?
                                        
            
**Two reasons to think the summit will still happen:**                      
         
1. Trump’s Secretary of State [Mike Pompeo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/05/14/is-the-administration-backing-off-trumps-demand-that-north-korea-get-rid-of-its-nukes/?h_sid=53ac2d01e4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.6855598998be) has suggested that the U.S. would be satisfied with much less than complete nuclear disarmament.                 
                        
2. Trump is desperate to hold the summit and the North Koreans know it. Art of the Deal!                         
                
**Oh Yeah, Ethics**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The Office of Government Ethics effectively referred President Trump to the Justice Department for [criminal investigation](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/5/16/17361704/trump-financial-disclosure-stormy-cohen-ethics?h_sid=53ac2d01e4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) after Trump disclosed that he reimbursed Michael Cohen** for making a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. Wait a second… was Trump… lying about it the whole time?                                      
             
**OGE appears to have concluded that by disclosing the Cohen reimbursement, Trump revealed that he knew he owed Cohen money last year,** yet failed to list that debt on his 2017 form. *ProPublica* wrote a [helpful tweetstorm](https://twitter.com/ProPublica/status/996882689503440897) about the rest of the disclosure.      
                             
**What Else**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The Senate passed a resolution to [restore net neutrality](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/16/politics/net-neutrality-vote-senate-democrats/index.html?h_sid=53ac2d01e4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) today, after the Republican-led Federal Communications Commission repealed it in late 2017.** If the House were to take it up the resolution and pass it, Trump could still veto it, but Speaker Paul Ryan is expected to shelve it (of course), which makes it a GREAT campaign issue.                         
                    
**Michael Cohen [personally solicited $1 million from the government of Qatar](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trumps-personal-attorney-solicited-1-million-from-government-of-qatar/2018/05/16/e787e716-592c-11e8-858f-12becb4d6067_story.html?h_sid=53ac2d01e4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.ed1575b42513) in 2016,** in exchange for access to and advice about the Trump administration. Qatar reportedly declined, and then shit went downhill for them from there. The flood of Cohen disclosures in the past week began because a federal investigator was worried that someone or some people in the government were helping Cohen and Trump engage in a cover up by destroying official suspicious activity reports (SARs) connected to Cohen’s shady hush-money-and-bribery LLC (cool company!), and then [started leaking](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/missing-files-motivated-the-leak-of-michael-cohens-financial-records?h_sid=53ac2d01e4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).

Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have sued the state over the law.

**Trump, King of Nuance**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**On Wednesday, President Trump faced widespread backlash for referring to some [deported immigrants as “animals.”](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/16/17362870/trump-immigrants-animals-ms-13-illegal?h_sid=dc0fc2d90d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)**                                  
            
**Republican pundits rushed to Trump’s defense,** arguing that Trump had been taken out of context, and had only referred to MS-13 gang members as animals. People should read the full transcript, which makes it pretty clear that Trump was doing the same thing he’s been doing since he called Mexican immigrants rapists when he launched his campaign: conflating immigrants with criminals.                            
            
**Many [Republican critics](https://twitter.com/brianbeutler/status/997121191398772736) decided to take their argument a step further by accusing liberals and Democrats of siding with MS-13** over Trump—a predictably gross move that [made its way into Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ press briefing today](https://twitter.com/tparti/status/997170689441501189).                     
            
**The bullying tactic worked well enough that the *Associated Press* [deleted a tweet](https://twitter.com/AP/status/997138543817449472)** because it didn’t include the caveats conservatives demanded.                  
               
**From Brian:** This episode dovetails with an increasingly prominent conservative argument that excessive liberal accusations of racism are responsible for making Republicans embrace white nationalism. Yes, people actually say that. But it’s a rigged game. It confronts Trump’s critics with a choice between giving him a pass on his racism (selling the humanity of immigrants short) or being accused of elitism, or worse. Here, Trump said something racist, people called it racist, and his supporters turned around and accused those people of being in league with gang members. Nobody can force conservatives to stop defending Trump’s racism, but nobody has to buy into these bad faith arguments either.

Reminder: We did hear A LOT about the investigation of his opponent! Still frustrating!                              
               
**The Trump investigation has since [yielded](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/us/politics/mueller-investigation-charges.html?h_sid=dc0fc2d90d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) dozens of indictments and five guilty pleas,** underscoring why it was needed in the first place. Trump propagandists, by contrast, are characterizing the very fact his advisers were under investigation as evidence that the FBI “spied” on his campaign. How dare they investigate people who later admitted their own guilt! Why won’t the FBI let my crime syndicate operate with impunity? This is America!

**An armed student [opened fire in an art class](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/18/us/texas-school-shooting/index.html?h_sid=3f38fd6bbb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) with a shotgun and a revolver at Santa Fe High School outside Houston, Texas, killing 10 and injuring 10 others.** Authorities also found explosive devices in and around the school, though it is not yet clear if any detonated. The shooter—a 17-year-old student—obtained the weapons from his father, who owned them legally. He surrendered to police, who have detained a second person of interest, also believed to be a student.

**After the shooting, Texas [Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick](https://twitter.com/TomNamako/status/997557776850268162), a staunch opponent of gun control,** attributed the massacre to the fact that the schools have “too many entrances and exits.” Ah yes, the only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with no doors.                            
              
**In part because the killer was known to wear a black trench coat to school every day,** pro-gun activists trained their focus on teachers and school administrators, asking why they hadn’t identified him as a threat and intervened before the shooting.                                     
               
**All of this is diversionary and it is bullshit.** Trench coats aren’t the problem, nor are entrances and exits. “Door control” isn’t a thing. Educators can’t and shouldn’t be expected to be law enforcement officers with flawless intuitions about all of their students’ troubles. The problem, as always, is the guns.

Trump kicked things off this weekend when he [demanded an investigation](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/998256454590193665) of the counterintelligence investigation of his campaign. Trump’s order bulldozed the firewall meant to prevent the White House from interfering with federal investigations for political purposes.                      
                 
**Rosenstein sought to defuse the crisis by instructing the Justice Department’s inspector general** to expand his existing investigation of the process by which DOJ secured a surveillance order on Trump’s former adviser and self-incrimination hobbyist Carter Page. After the meeting Monday, the [White House](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-confirms-trump-meeting-with-top-intelligence-officials/?h_sid=67ded051d6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) announced it had accepted Rosenstein’s accommodation, but added that “White House Chief of Staff [John] Kelly will immediately set up a meeting with the FBI, DOJ, and DNI together with Congressional Leaders to review highly classified and other information they have requested.” Trump and his loyalists in Congress keep demanding access to evidence in the Russia investigation, and DOJ keeps giving it to them.                                    
                   
**The backdrop for all this was an [explosive *New York Times* story](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/19/us/politics/trump-jr-saudi-uae-nader-prince-zamel.html?h_sid=67ded051d6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;login=email&amp;auth=login-email) that revealed** the Trump campaign also solicited assistance in the election from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. As the report notes, “it is illegal for foreign governments or individuals to be involved in American elections.” The story implicates both Donald Trump, Jr. and Erik Prince in serious wrongdoing, and may explain why Trump abruptly took his efforts to interfere with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation to an alarming and corrupt new level. (Are we at the boss level yet?)                                      
           
**From Brian:** The scandal of Russian meddling in the 2016 election may be transforming into a larger story of the corruption of U.S. foreign policy by a transnational consortium of authoritarians, who saw value in having one of their own in control of the American government, and found Trump to be a willing coconspirator.

**FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein** will [meet later this week](https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/999009807041515520), at President Trump’s insistence, with Republicans Devin Nunes and Trey Gowdy, where the congressmen will be given access to secret documents about [Stefan Halper](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/who-is-stefan-a-halper-the-fbi-source-who-assisted-the-russia-investigation/2018/05/21/22c46caa-5d42-11e8-9ee3-49d6d4814c4c_story.html?h_sid=5f7020a835-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.b34edbe680ab), the FBI informant and longtime Republican operative who assisted in the counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign.                     
                
**The White House [did not invite](https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/999008243363012609) any Democrats,** because the point isn’t to help Congress conduct oversight. The goal is to allow Republicans to publicly misrepresent what they learn, and to allow Nunes to relay evidence back to Trump, who is a subject of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. This was always always always about undermining and breaching the Mueller probe. Huge surprise there!                                  
               
**Another surprise: Trump made a bunch of outlandish claims about the informant at a White House press availability on Tuesday.** On Monday [his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/giuliani-mueller-trump-fbi-source_us_5b032010e4b07309e05b3820?h_sid=5f7020a835-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) Trump needs to be read into the informant’s role in the investigation before he agrees to an interview with Mueller. When Giuliani was a prosecutor, he would have been totally cool with giving evidence to a subject of an investigation because the subject was afraid of being caught in a lie. Classic prosecutor move.

**The House passed a Senate-approved bill today that [rolls back banking regulations](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bank-bill-deregulation-congress_us_5b043b70e4b0c0b8b23ea6cd?h_sid=5f7020a835-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;ncid=engmodushpmg00000004) and weakens consumer protections,** with [33 Democrats](https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/999056704221433862) voting for it. Banks were already reporting record profits following the passage of Trump’s corporate tax cuts, but America can never be looted too much.

Very cool that the person charged with the “security” of the “homeland” is unfamiliar with Russia’s efforts to sabotage it.

(It’s a fun mystery!) Today Trump [denied](https://www.axios.com/us-china-deal-zte-trump-trade-war-sanctions-north-korea-5c77d7b5-43d3-4bb3-90f6-2299c81d4aa1.html?h_sid=5f7020a835-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiospm&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;stream=top&amp;utm_source=newsletter) that there is a deal with ZTE.

**Republicans claimed against tons of evidence that Donald Trump’s corporate tax cuts would create jobs and spur investment, but, LOL, jokes on us!** According to CNN, “economists see little evidence that the tax cuts sparked an acceleration of investments in new equipment, factories, or other projects. Instead, business spending has remained steady, and though some saw bonuses and wage increases, the most notable impact was in stock buybacks that went into the pockets of companies’ shareholders.”

**“I want to demean you and discredit you so that when you do negative stories about me, no one will believe you.”**                         
         
As always, the truth is shocking, but not surprising. And here, it’s mostly shocking to imagine Donald Trump speaking so succinctly.

**The Real Fake Scandal Scandal**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump kicked off the day tweeting about “[SPYGATE](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/999246677549768704),” underscoring the two tracks of the Russia scandal.** One is real and pretty well hidden. It’s a sprawling criminal investigation, the details and dimensions of which we only know through reporting and leaks from people implicated in the probe. Then there’s the fake one, made up of conspiracy theories and deceptions coming from the president and his pals in the right-wing propaganda industry.                       
                    
**In the fake scandal:**                  
             
- **[Trump says](https://www.buzzfeed.com/mattberman/trump-spygate-campaign-what?h_sid=37907ce5f6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.ooy88ynY6#.xr899rkN4) Obama and the FBI planted a “SPY” in his campaign to sabotage him,** though they were so bad at sabotage that Trump won after the FBI kneecapped Hillary right before the election.                
         
- **The White House is now test driving the claim that this imaginary spy planted evidence of collusion** where no collusion existed, according to [*Vanity Fair*’s Gabriel Sherman](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/05/inside-trumpworld-a-bizarre-counter-narrative-takes-hold?h_sid=37907ce5f6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).                    
         
- **This builds on the conspiracy theory laid out in the Nunes memo (since debunked)** that the DOJ improperly wiretapped foreign agents who worked for Trump and a related conspiracy theory (also debunked) that the investigation was launched on the basis of the Steele dossier.                      
                   
**In the real investigation:**              
              
- **Special Counsel Robert Mueller [interviewed Jared Kushner last month](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/23/politics/special-counsel-abbe-lowell-kushner-interview/index.html?h_sid=37907ce5f6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** for the second time.            
          
- **Ukraine gave [Michael Cohen $400,000](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-44215656?h_sid=37907ce5f6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) to set up a meeting between Trump and Ukraine’s president,** after which Ukraine scuttled its cooperation with Mueller and [shelved its investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/world/europe/ukraine-mueller-manafort-missiles.html?h_sid=37907ce5f6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) of Paul Manafort.                    
         
- **Cohen’s business partner, Evgeny Friedman, [promised to cooperate with federal investigators](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/nyregion/michael-cohen-trump-taxi-cooperation.html?h_sid=37907ce5f6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** which will increase pressure on Cohen to flip on Trump.     
                                 
- **Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani [described](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-giuliani-collusion_us_5b0487f8e4b05f0fc8429767?h_sid=37907ce5f6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) the emails Russia stole** from Democrats, which Trump and his aides solicited publicly and privately, as “gifts.”                          
                   
- **Mueller has [issued](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/23/17384096/mueller-investigation-poll?h_sid=37907ce5f6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) 17 indictments and secured five guilty pleas.**                     
                    
**This divide between the real and fake investigation explains why Trump wants [only Republicans](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/us/politics/republicans-information-russia-investigation.html?h_sid=37907ce5f6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) to be part of a meeting he ordered** between FBI Director Christopher Wray, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and Trump’s biggest lackey in Congress, Devin Nunes. It’s way easier for Nunes to come up with a bullshit story about “SPYGATE” without Democratic witnesses. And that’s why [Democrats are asking](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/23/schumer-and-pelosi-ask-to-attend-meeting-on-secret-russia-probe-documents.html?h_sid=37907ce5f6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) Wray and Rosenstein to either cancel the meeting or make it bipartisan.                
                              
**From Brian:** The right’s propaganda campaign to discredit the Mueller investigation has muddied the issue pretty well. A [significant majority of Americans](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/23/17384096/mueller-investigation-poll?h_sid=37907ce5f6-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), for instance, believe Mueller has turned up no evidence of criminality, even though Trump’s national security adviser, campaign chair, deputy chair, and foreign policy adviser are all now either indicted or confessed felons. Democrats need to step up, demand to be included in the Nunes meeting, and press Republicans on why Trump’s DOJ is politicizing intelligence.

The owners apparently did not consult the [NFL players union](https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedNews/status/999337519933214720) at any point in the creation of this policy, and according to players, these new rules “[contradict] the statements made to our player leadership by Commissioner Roger Goodell.”

**Tesla CEO Elon Musk went on an unhinged [rant about the media](https://twitter.com/natemcdermott/status/999370140071481345) on Twitter,** after Tesla received some negative press coverage. His tweetstorm, which renowned moron/alt-right hero [Donald Trump, Jr. endorsed](https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/999366215696109569), culminated with the [#disruptive idea](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/999367582271422464) to “create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article &amp; track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor &amp; publication.”               
                       
**Musk also whined about people comparing him to Trump, and he has a point:** Even an autocrat as committed to discrediting the media as Donald Trump has not gone so far as to suggest that online mobs should determine what is true and who is trustworthy.

**Ask Not For Whom The Nobel Tolls**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump announced on Thursday that he will not attend a summit with North Korea** scheduled for next month. In [a highly unusual letter to Kim Jong Un](https://twitter.com/jeneps/status/999647233543991298), Trump attributed his decision to the “tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in [Kim’s] recent statement.”                           
              
**Trump released the letter publicly without giving the North Korean leadership or the leaders of allied governments in [South Korea](https://twitter.com/FrankJannuzi/status/999669132562845702) and [Japan](https://twitter.com/nwadhams/status/999669986649141248)** any advanced notice of his decision—which went poorly with friend and foe alike. The North Koreans appear to have learned about Trump’s decisions [from a group of international reporters](https://twitter.com/PeterAlexander/status/999660246275641344) on assignment to cover North Korean dismantlement of a nuclear test site, who [read the letter aloud to their hosts](https://twitter.com/AnaCabrera/status/999667715915870208). (Instead of just keeping it to themselves and getting the heck out of there.)                                   
                
**The most sober assessment of this mess is that Trump was wildly unprepared for the challenge all along,** and much too desperate to win a domestic public relations battle than to actually strike a deal that advanced our global interests. But because Trump did something genuinely different than past presidents, and because the punditry has been eager to find something to praise Trump for, many observers gave the Trump effort a lot of credit. Axios even called the letter a “reminder to Americans that he milked his adversary and gave them nothing in return.” Milked. Ew.                               
           
**In reality, Trump agreed to a meeting with Kim sight unseen** (a big concession), sent his secretary of state to meet Kim multiple times (also a concession), canceled South Korea-U.S. military exercises (another concession), and ended up without a nuclear disarmament agreement.                          
                 
**Not all concessions are bad though! Unlikely as it seems, the best hope going forward is that Trump and Kim reschedule the summit** after Trump lays the proper groundwork and sets expectations appropriately. Failing that, there may still be a lasting upside: Trump is probably the only politician in America who could have broken the taboo against agreeing to meet Kim without preconditions. Other Republicans would have been too hawkish, and if President Obama (or any Democrat) had tried, the same Republicans who said Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize would have screamed “APPEASEMENT!” from the top of the Washington Monument. So maybe that’s good? For the future? If we make it to the future?

I’ve been on this sub, using various accounts, since October, and a consistent source of drama is the way people here talk about guests who are not white or men. I’m not the ideal person to lead a conversation on this, because I’m white, but I was hoping more people would be interested in chiming in on this issue. 

This week I legitimately did dislike a guest of LOLI, but I realized after commenting about it that I was really shallow/lazy in my comment and that most of the discussion the comment generated would probably have not happened if the guest in question had been a white man (or even a white woman.)

I think it’s a given that the people in this sub are liberals, but this is reddit so most people are also white men. It’s hard to ignore that there’s a pattern with these kinds of comments. 

I think going forward if there was a productive discussion about the implicit biases people might have, it would lead to better discussions in the future. Today's PSA ("This is who we are.") is supposed to be the Boston Calling show from Saturday, but it's actually the earlier Boston show that came out as a bonus pod this weekendThis is inspired by the absolute grilling Jon is getting on Twitter, as he usually gets, about the shitty and vile immigration policy that the administration is putting forth. 

Honestly, the party would do *leaps and bounds* better if it came to grips with its complicity in its inhumanity over the last century as well as recently, ranging from immigration to racial justice, etc. I'm turning it off from now on when they bring up 2020 with Elizabeth Warren or Deval Patrick or anyone who might be a candidate for president but hasn't announced.  Those questions never lead to enlightening answers, only a waste of time.  They smack of CNN-like desperation to "make something happen" or "shake up the narrative."  

I'm fine with discussion of what the field might be when a guest isn't on.  It's a legitimate topic.  But quit putting people on the spot.  It's cringey to listen to.*"Policy chic"—White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley describing Stephen Miller’s “[aesthetic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/05/stephen-miller-trump-adviser/561317/?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),” in the latest longform profile of bespoke fascists*                
                
**A Memorial Day Monument To Lying**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Donald Trump told a lot of big lies this weekend—even more than usual!**                      
              
**First, Trump [claimed](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1000375761604370434) that Democrats are standing in the way of changing a law** that requires the separation of parents and their children who cross the border seeking asylum from violence in their home countries. This is actually two lies. It is not a law, it is [a new policy](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/28/us/trump-immigrant-children-lost.html?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) devised by the Trump administration. And Democrats [are insisting](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/us/politics/trump-democrats-immigrant-families.html?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) that the Trump administration reverse the policy.                  
          
**Here’s the truth about Trump’s policy:**                  
            
- The administration first [began considering it late last year](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/to-curb-illegal-border-crossings-trump-administration-weighs-new-measures-targeting-families/2017/12/21/19300dc2-e66c-11e7-9ec2-518810e7d44d_story.html?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.a2367d8e1769&amp;noredirect=on).            
              
- White House Chief of Staff John Kelly began talking it up [in March](https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/06/politics/john-kelly-separating-children-from-parents-immigration-border/?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).                    
         
- Earlier this month, Kelly infamously [dismissed concerns](http://www.businessinsider.com/john-kelly-family-separation-policy-illegal-border-crossing-2018-5?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) about the idea by saying, "the children will be taken care of—put into foster care or whatever.”                     
          
- Trump lashed out at his Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, for initially [resisting the policy](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/us/politics/trump-homeland-security-secretary-resign.html?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84). She gave in 11 days ago and said, “If you break the law, you go to jail and you're separated from your family. It shouldn't be any different for illegal immigrants.”                 
             
**Second, Trump lied this weekend when he accused the *New York Times* of [fabricating an administration source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-falsely-accuses-the-new-york-times-of-making-up-a-source-it-was-an-official-who-briefed-reporters/2018/05/26/2d055a60-612c-11e8-8c93-8cf33c21da8d_story.html?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.231c1f12d7fc&amp;noredirect=on)** who cast doubt on the feasibility of holding the U.S./North Korea summit on June 12th. (The source's name is Matt Pottinger and the Times story was based on a sanctioned White House briefing, which basically means Trump told him to say these things, then got mad when the *New York Times* reported it. Stable genius!)                          
            
**Third, Trump continued to promote [a conspiracy theory](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/25/17380212/spygate-trump-russia-spy-stefan-halper-fbi-explained?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) he calls "Spygate,"** which is about Democrats planting "spies" in his campaign. His lawyer, Rudy Giuliani [pointed to this Trump-fabricated conspiracy theory](https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1000729767510003712) as evidence that the Russia investigation is illegitimate. (In the actual investigation into Trump, his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is a [key witness](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/us/politics/trump-sessions-obstruction.html?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) following Trump’s request that Sessions remain in charge of the Russia investigation after he recused himself last year.)                  
                  
**These aren't "unproven" or he-said, she-said claims. They are lies.** The lies are meant to make politics on the basis of reason and fact impossible. Being clear about the truth, and about why Trump is lying, is more important than ever.                           
              
**Roseanne is Racist (Who Could Have Known?!)**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Today [ABC canceled its hit reboot of *Roseanne*](http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/29/media/roseanne-twitter-chelsea-clinton/index.html?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** after Roseanne Barr went on a racist Twitter rant Tuesday morning, in which she called former Obama administration official Valerie Jarrett a child of the “Muslim Brotherhood” and “Planet of the Apes,” and attacked both Chelsea Clinton and George Soros, who we are pretty sure she thinks run the Illuminati.                    
                    
**In a statement, ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said "Roseanne's Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values,”** and Disney CEO Bob Iger echoed that sentiment, saying that cancelling the show was “the right thing to do.” Her agency [ICM quickly dropped her](https://twitter.com/koblin/status/1001539839223848960) afterwards. We’re guessing that the show will be picked up by NRATV tomorrow.                   
             
**This response is the right one, but Barr has promoted racist ideas and conspiracy theories [for years](https://www.buzzfeed.com/marcusjones/roseanne-barr-tweets-that-werent-repugnant-enough-for?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.bsP2LLDJwk#.bsP2LLDJwk).** The decision to reboot her show was bound to blow back on the network. Like Trump, Roseanne’s racist and conspiratorial views aren’t subtle or secret.                          
        
**From Brian:** A common thread connecting the Trump news and the Roseanne news is the role euphemism has played in normalizing both figures. In Roseanne’s case, journalists once again [struggled to describe racism plainly](https://thinkprogress.org/roseanne-barr-racist-tweets-media-euphemisms-2a115bd9d5c9/?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84). It’s no different with Trump: Journalists often describe his racist tweets as "racially charged," his baseless conspiracy theories as "unproven," and his lies as "demonstrable falsehoods." Important values are under attack in the Trump era, and his critics are rightly upset when institutions don’t defend those values.                                       
               
**What Else**

**Last week, Ireland voted overwhelmingly to [end its extreme policies](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44256152?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) restricting access to abortion.** The U.K., which controls Northern Ireland, is now facing increased pressure to do the same. Meanwhile, the U.S. is regressing.

That law may now be implemented pending further legal challenges.                  
                  
**A 22-year-old immigrant from Mali is being called “[Spider-Man](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/28/asia/paris-baby-spiderman-rescue-intl/index.html?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)” after he scaled the side of a building to rescue a child who was suspended from a balcony** in Paris over the weekend. Now, French President Emmanuel Macron says he will be granted citizenship. President Trump is in the process of crafting a tweet calling him a member of MS-13.                       
                
**China has approved [13 new Ivanka Trump trademarks](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/05/28/china-ivanka-trump-trademarks-610029?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).** She is a government official, and her acceptance of private business favors from foreign governments—including the Chinese government, which Trump intends to reward by bailing out the sanctioned company ZTE—is public corruption in plain sight. Or as Maggie Haberman calls it “un-legal friendship money deals.”                  
               
**A new CIA assessment has concluded that North Korea [does not intend to denuclearize](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/cia-report-says-north-korea-won-t-denuclearize-might-open-n878201?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** but may consider opening a “Western hamburger franchise” in Pyongyang, in order to show goodwill.

The trainings come in response to an episode that received national attention last month when the manager of a Starbucks in Philadelphia called the police on two black men who met in a store without purchasing anything.     
                  
**Rep. Tom Garrett (R-VA) announced that he will [not run for re-election](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/rep-garrett-announces-he-is-an-alcoholic-and-will-not-seek-re-election/2018/05/28/40e8839a-62b2-11e8-99d2-0d678ec08c2f_story.html?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.1b326492b138) this year in order to seek treatment for his alcoholism.** The district leans Republican, according to [*Cook Political Report*](https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings?h_sid=5918658403-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), though Garrett’s Democratic challenger Leslie Cockburn had raised more money than he had prior to his announcement.

Cool boss!                           
                 
**Trump's latest outburst came in response to a [*New York Times* story](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/us/politics/trump-sessions-obstruction.html?h_sid=86d3d62e1c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) about his efforts to bully Sessions into rescinding his recusal** from the Russia investigation. The Times story confirms what has been apparent for months: Sessions is one of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's key witnesses, and his efforts to determine whether Trump obstructed the Russia investigation extends well beyond his motives for firing FBI Director James Comey.                  
                  
**That's bad news for Trump because his well-documented desire to install a loyalist to oversee the investigation is very corrupt.** No less a GOP partisan Rep. Trey "Benghazi" Gowdy (R-SC) has spent the week [refuting Trump’s attacks](https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/29/politics/trey-gowdy-fbi-confidential-source-trump-russia/index.html?h_sid=86d3d62e1c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) on the investigation and saying it was conducted properly. As president, Trump's only concern should be that the supervisor of such an investigation is an ethical person. Trying to replace the supervisor of an investigation that even Gowdy says is well-grounded with a loyalist tells us everything we need to know about Trump’s motives.

Boy Scouts don't lie to the Senate. Bipartisan majorities don't find honorable people too racist for federal judgeships. The Scouts should have a badge for being less shitty than Jeff Sessions. Sessions is still around because Trump seems to genuinely fear the consequences of firing him. That sure as hell doesn’t mean that Session deserves the job, and there are a lot of people who argue he should be fired. But when it comes to protecting the Russia investigation, the alternative would be worse. Hey Scouts, use that silver lining to make a cool knot!

**Gravity Comes For Trump**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**You wouldn’t know it from mainstream news coverage, but President Trump’s efforts to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller have largely failed.** The public actually cares a great deal both about whether his campaign conspired with Russia to subvert a U.S.election, and about his corruption more generally.       
               
**A [new poll](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/poll-60-percent-disapprove-of-trump-while-clear-majorities-back-mueller-and-sessions/2018/08/30/4cd32174-ac7c-11e8-a8d7-0f63ab8b1370_story.html?h_sid=22cc70b025-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.572841c3a3eb&amp;noredirect=on) from ABC News and the *Washington Post* underscores how wrong the conventional wisdom about the Russia investigation has been**—and how misguided the media’s obsessions with Trump’s loyal base is.       
               
**The survey finds that 63 percent of adults support Mueller’s investigation, and that nearly all of these supporters strongly support it.** Only [29 percent of adults oppose it](https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2018/08/31/National-Politics/Polling/question_20701.xml?h_sid=22cc70b025-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;uuid=XQ5MzK0MEeiafc0wUE_5Ag), and nearly all of those are self-identified Republicans.       
               
**The full breakdown is even more damning.** Independents support Mueller 67-24, and even after a year of insisting that the Russia investigation is a witch hunt, that the FBI and Justice Department are out to get him, that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is conflicted, and that his team is corrupt, [nearly a third of Republicans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2018/08/31/National-Politics/Polling/question_20701.xml?h_sid=22cc70b025-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;uuid=XQ5MzK0MEeiafc0wUE_5Ag) nevertheless support the probe.       
               
**These results closely track the poll’s findings across a range of Russia-related issues.** The public believes Trump has obstructed justice, supports the prosecution of Paul Manafort, opposes Trump’s brewing plan to pardon him, believes Attorney General Jeff Sessions was right to let the investigation proceed, and thinks Trump committed a crime by buying his mistresses’ silence before the election.       
               
**A large plurality, [45 percent](https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2018/08/31/National-Politics/Polling/release_528.xml?h_sid=22cc70b025-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;tid=a_inl_manual&amp;tidloc=4), believe Trump has made political corruption worse,** while only 13 percent believe he has decreased corruption. (Don’t stop to think about that 13 percent too much. Imagine believing he’s taken on corruption!)       
               
**From Brian:** These results are important in their own right, particularly as Trump prepares for a [Lame Duck Massacre](https://crooked.com/newsletter/what-a-day-getting-his-lame-ducks-in-a-row/?h_sid=22cc70b025-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84). They underscore just how politically disastrous Trump’s plans to obstruct or terminate the Russia investigation are. But they also reflect a larger reality: A full 60 percent of adults disapprove of Trump’s handling of the presidency, and 53 percent strongly disapprove. More people *loathe* the president than support him in any way, even tepidly. The big story of the Trump presidency is the intensity of the opposition, but in their obsession with his much smaller base, much of the media has lost the plot.

**Opening StatementZzzz**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee [Brett Kavanaugh](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/04/politics/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-senate-hearing/index.html?h_sid=2e969d52de-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) kicked off Tuesday morning,** even as Republican lawyers [continue their efforts to conceal records from Kavanaugh’s service](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/4/17818210/supreme-court-nominee-kavanaugh-hearing?h_sid=2e969d52de-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) in the George W. Bush administration. Republicans have barely bothered to pretend that they’re not trying to rush Kavanaugh on to the Supreme Court before midterm elections or new indictments from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and so the hearings immediately devolved into a spectacle:       
               
**Less than 24 hours before the hearing began, a lawyer for former President Bush [produced 42,000 documents](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/09/03/hours-before-kavanaugh-nomination-hearings-bush-lawyer-releases-42000-pages-of-documents-to-judiciary-committee/?h_sid=2e969d52de-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** stemming from Kavanaugh’s time in Bush’s White House counsel’s office. George W. Bush: GTFO of the resistance.       
               
**Senate Republicans spent the first day of hearings pretending that the total number of these documents proves that the White House has not been trying to conceal anything,** obscuring the fact that the vast majority of Kavanaugh’s official records will not be turned over. On this basis, [Democrats sought repeatedly to adjourn the hearing](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/04/politics/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-senate-hearing/index.html?h_sid=2e969d52de-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) but Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley shut down their efforts.       
               
**Though Kavanaugh will not respond to senators’ questions until tomorrow,** Democrats foreshadowed that their questions will home in on four main issue areas:       
               
- Pre-existing conditions protections in the [Affordable Care Act](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/03/kavanaugh-democrats-strategy-trump-supreme-court-health-care-806034?h_sid=2e969d52de-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) (currently at the center of a legal challenge that may reach the Supreme Court)       
               
- [Roe v. Wade](https://www.wsj.com/articles/roe-v-wade-likely-to-play-starring-role-at-kavanaugh-hearings-1536058800?h_sid=2e969d52de-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;ns=prod%2Faccounts-wsj)       
               
- [Executive power](https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/1037050486854168577) (particularly as it pertains to Kavanaugh’s view that the president is effectively above the law)       
               
- The [concealment of Kavanaugh’s records](https://thinkprogress.org/kavanaugh-documents-supreme-court-hearing-bf2fef91f325/?h_sid=2e969d52de-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=tp-letters&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter) (and the related matter of whether he lied to the committee when it considered his nomination to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals)       
                
**Republicans underscored their desire to confirm Kavanaugh no matter what happens.** The lone exception was [Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ)](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/us/politics/kavanaugh-confirmation-hearing-updates.html?h_sid=2e969d52de-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) who promised to probe Kavanaugh’s views of executive power, particularly in light of President Trump’s weekend tweet rebuking the Justice Department for hurting Republican chances in the midterm by indicting corrupt GOP congressmen.       
                
**From Brian:** At this point, Kavanaugh will only be stopped if unexpected developments convince two or more Republicans that they can’t accept the political risk of voting for him, or that they can’t support his confirmation in good conscience. That’s unlikely, but it’s not impossible. Kavanaugh is [historically unpopular already](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/4/17799842/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-confirmation-hearing-polls?h_sid=2e969d52de-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), and may be prone to screwing up.       
                
**The only unscripted moment on Tuesday came when the [father of a girl who was murdered in the Parkland school massacre](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/04/politics/parkland-fred-guttenberg-brett-kavanaugh/index.html?h_sid=2e969d52de-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) introduced himself to Kavanaugh during a brief recess.** Kavanaugh refused to shake his hand and turned away dismissively. The White House was alarmed enough by how bad this interaction looked that it issued an official statement lying about what happened. Kavanaugh may not be able to survive more vivid, revealing displays of callousness like that. Give your senators a call and remind them why this matters to you → (202) 224-3121       
                
**"Fear" Factor**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Excerpts from journalist Bob Woodward’s new book on the Trump White House, “Fear,” were released today.** And it’s wild stuff, people.       
                
**Among the book’s new revelations:**       
                
- **Trump called Defense Secretary Jim Mattis after a chemical weapons attack in Syria and said,** “Let’s fucking kill [Syrian President Bashar al-Assad]! Let’s go in. Let’s kill the fucking lot of them.” Mattis has told associates that Trump “acted like—and had the understanding of—‘a fifth- or sixth-grader,’”  in national security council meetings. Seems generous.       
                
- **In a mock southern accent, Trump called Attorney General Jeff Sessions “mentally retarded,” adding “He’s this dumb Southerner...** He couldn’t even be a one-person country lawyer down in Alabama.” Prepare yourself for when some mainstream publication does diner interviews with Trump fans in Alabama who report that they admire Trump’s candor.       
                
- **Trump’s former chief economic adviser Gary Cohn, who now believes Trump is a “professional liar,”** repeatedly avoided international crises, including the dissolution of NAFTA, by stealing paperwork from Trump’s desk, confident that the president would forget his own goals.       
                
- **Trump’s criminal lawyers told Special Counsel Robert Mueller that Trump lies too much and is too stupid to submit to an interview.** One of those lawyers, John Dowd, ultimately quit because Trump didn’t accept his advice that Trump faces a choice between not testifying and “an orange jumpsuit.”       
                
- **White House Chief of Staff John Kelly told colleagues that Trump’s, “an idiot.** It’s pointless to try to convince him of anything. He’s gone off the rails. We’re in Crazytown. I don’t even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job I’ve ever had.” Can’t believe the train derailed in Crazytown, of all places.       
                
- **Ivanka Trump refers to herself as the “first daughter,” who is above being a mere “staffer.”** She’s great!       
                
**It’s extremely frustrating that Woodward’s sources are anonymously leaking to Woodward** instead of testifying to Congress (or otherwise alerting the public) that they have concluded Trump is unfit for his job. If they think the country needs saving, they’re doing a real shit job of it!       
                
**What Else**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**On Monday President Trump [attacked his Justice Department and Attorney General Jeff Sessions](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1036681588573130752) via Twitter for putting** “two easy [midterm election] wins now in doubt” by indicting Republican congressmen.

The fact that Kyl hasn’t committed to serving through McCain’s term has [invited speculation that Gov. Doug Ducey (R-AZ)](https://twitter.com/ByronTau/status/1037016106781876225) intends to appoint Republican Martha McSally to the seat next year, if she loses to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema in the race to replace retiring Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) in November.       
                
**Journalist Ronan Farrow has [broken his silence](https://twitter.com/RonanFarrow/status/1036825901676154880) about NBC’s conduct during his reporting on disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein.** Farrow says that in justifying its decision to not run the Weinstein story, NBC “omits women who were either identified in the NBC story or offered to be,” and notes that the story was “twice cleared and deemed ‘reportable’ by legal and standards only to be blocked by executives who refused to allow us to seek comment from Harvey Weinstein.” [Emily Nestor](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/03/media/andy-lack-nbc-news-ronan-farrow-harvey-weinsten/index.html?h_sid=2e969d52de-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=a5580abce4-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_09_04_07_48&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=CNN+Five+Things&amp;utm_term=0_6da287d761-a5580abce4-86393421), a Weinstein victim whom Farrow interviewed for the *New Yorker*, came forward supporting his claim that NBC was not interested in an interview in which she accused Weinstein.       
                
**Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel will [not seek re-election to a third term next year](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-met-chicago-mayor-rahm-emanuel-wont-run-for-reelection-20180904-story.html?h_sid=2e969d52de-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).** He announced his decision just ahead of the murder trial of the police officer who shot and killed Laquan McDonald in 2014. Emanuel faced intense backlash for trying to conceal footage of the shooting, and then drew the ire of the police union for firing the Chicago police superintendent over the coverup.       
                
**[Amazon](https://www.recode.net/2018/9/4/17819508/amazon-trillion-market-cap-power?h_sid=2e969d52de-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) just became the second publicly traded American company to be worth $1 trillion,** but remains at the center of a number of controversies, including its poor treatment of workers, its cannibalization of the retail industry, and its effort to extort tax benefits from the cities where Amazon might set up its second headquarters.

It’s now been 51 days since i hung it up.](https://twitter.com/Jevholution/status/1036415320959930368)"**This week's episode was pretty interesting but last week was especially amazing with the Terry Crews interview. I want to know what this sub's thoughts are.So, on Friday I'm starting on a four-hour road trip with my dad, who lives in Florida and voted for Trump.  He's not a card-carrying MAGA hat-wearing member, I just think he genuinely believes what he sees on Fox News. He responds to facts, whenever I can remain dispassionate enough to calmly lay them out for him.

Anyway, I want to take the opportunity to listen to a couple pods in the car with him.  Does anyone have any suggestions for the best 3-4 to play?  I know not all the shows are totally evergreen since they're weekly roundups - but I would particularly like some relatively recent ones that focus mainly on Trump, and round up the evidence for the charges against him.  I'd also ideally like to avoid ones that focus too much on Democratic Party politics or local elections, because I know he'll lose interest (and I'll be driving so I can't do any selective scrubbing).

Any suggestions would be hugely appreciated - and let's see I can't squeeze a vote for Andrew Gillum out of him by the end of the weekend.*"I was asked to do that by my son, Don"—Trump [blaming](https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/1037364724315443200) Don Jr for his endorsement of a losing candidate.*       
               
**Kava-not Gonna Answer That Question**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Supreme Court nominee [Brett Kavanaugh](https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/brett-kavanaugh-confirmation-hearing-day-2-questioning-2018-09-05-live-updates/?h_sid=1c510bcfc3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) proved his skeptics are right to worry that his confirmation would be disastrous for equality and the rule of law.** He may also have found himself trapped by past lies about his own history as a highly partisan Republican operative, which means a bombshell may await him tomorrow.       
               
**Early in the his second day of his confirmation hearings, [Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT)](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pat-leahy-brett-kavanaugh_us_5b9019bfe4b0162f472951ee?h_sid=1c510bcfc3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), a former Senate Judiciary Committee chairman,** confronted Kavanaugh with evidence that Kavanaugh had lied to the committee years ago about his role in a Senate hacking scandal.       
               
**In the early 2000s, when Kavanaugh worked in the George W. Bush White House counsel’s office advancing judicial nominations,** Republican Senate staffers [hacked and stole Democratic Judiciary Committee emails](https://www.bna.com/miranda-warning-hacking-n73014482282/?h_sid=1c510bcfc3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), and eventually leaked some to the press.       
               
**One of those staffers [provided some of these stolen materials to Kavanaugh](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/kavanaugh-confirmation-hearings-patrick-leahy-points-to-email-that-suggests-judge-lied-to-senate.html?h_sid=1c510bcfc3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), via email and at off-site meetings,** to help the White House prepare nominees for Democratic questioning at confirmation hearings. Yet when Kavanaugh was an appellate court nominee 14 years ago, he testified that he never received stolen emails.       
               
**Leahy [has hinted](https://twitter.com/SenatorLeahy/status/1037415335488643073) that he may bring more evidence of Kavanaugh’s deception to the third day of hearings tomorrow.**       
               
**The rest of Kavanaugh’s testimony was marked by more familiar evasions.**       
               
**Moments after Kavanaugh confronted his own stolen email scandal, he declined to put to rest larger concerns about whether he stands ready to help Donald Trump**—the president who nominated him—avoid legal jeopardy stemming from multiple federal investigations.       
               
**Kavanaugh paid lip service to the idea that nobody’s above the law, but then [refused to answer](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/kavanaugh-hearing-trumps-supreme-court-nominee-faces-senate-grilling/2018/09/05/97fda1ac-b081-11e8-9a6a-565d92a3585d_story.html?h_sid=1c510bcfc3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.5cfcd59a0853&amp;noredirect=on#SUBPOENAS) when asked whether he believe presidents must respond to subpoenas,** or whether presidents can pardon themselves.       
               
**He played dumb under questioning by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) about the [role the Federalist Society](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/kavanaugh-claims-no-knowledge-of-federal-societys-role-in-his-nomination?h_sid=1c510bcfc3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)**—which vets conservative judges to identify reliably anti-abortion, pro-business Supreme Court justices—in recommending and underwriting his nomination.
       
               
**Kavanaugh also declined to weigh in on cases that he is likely to provide the deciding vote on a divided court,** including expected challenges to abortion, and a legal challenge underway to the [pre-existing conditions protections](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/kavanaugh-hearing-trumps-supreme-court-nominee-faces-senate-grilling/2018/09/05/97fda1ac-b081-11e8-9a6a-565d92a3585d_story.html?h_sid=1c510bcfc3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.210d1b9e7228#HEALTH) in the Affordable Care Act.       
               
**From Brian:** Before today, we’d been left to wonder whether Republicans were concealing Kavanaugh’s record because they were trying to hide something bad or simply trying to rush his nomination through. Now we know.

**Some highlights:**       
               
- **“Given the instability many witnessed, there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment,** which would start a complex process for removing the president.”       
               
- **“The root of the problem is the president’s amorality.** Anyone who works with him knows he is not moored to any discernible first principles that guide his decision making."        
               
- **“Meetings with him veer off topic and off the rails,** he engages in repetitive rants, and his impulsiveness results in half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back.”       
               
**In [response](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/05/politics/nyt-trump-resistance-op-ed/index.html?h_sid=1c510bcfc3-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), Trump called the editorial “a disgrace” and “gutless,” then tweeted “TREASON?”** and demanding that the Times turn the author “over to the government at once!” The White House also released an [official statement](https://twitter.com/Bencjacobs/status/1037451410776961025) in response, touting Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton, demanding an apology from the *New York Times*, and calling on the author to “do the right thing and resign.”       
               
**From Brian:** The line in the article that underscores the author’s own amorality is “we will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until—one way or another—it’s over.” The author clearly knows it could end in calamity, but is nevertheless unwilling to come forward publicly. Fortunately, it’s hard to imagine his or her identify remaining a secret for long.

**The question going into day three of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings** was whether Democrats could demonstrate that Kavanaugh is an untrustworthy man hiding an extreme agenda. It turns out they had the goods. The question now is whether any Republicans care.       
               
**Democrats—led by [Sen.

**Through these new disclosures—some authorized, some not—Democrats brought a ton of damning information to light.**

**Aspects of Mueller’s investigation will soon come before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, where Kavanaugh currently serves.** If he talked to anyone other than fellow judges about Mueller, judicial ethics rules may require him to recuse himself from that case.       
               
**From Brian:** Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings have been much rockier, and produced many more damning revelations, than any Supreme Court confirmation hearing in recent memory. So far, Republicans couldn’t care less. [Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME)](https://twitter.com/igorbobic/status/1037752664451366912) has already blown off the fact that Kavanaugh apparently misled her about his views on *Roe*. No Republican has come forward yet to say they’re troubled by his evasions and deceptions. There’s still time, but in the event that Republicans are still prepared to confirm him on a party line vote, Democrats should make clear that they will subpoena the rest of his documents, and complete a thorough review of his records when they next control the House or Senate—even if he’s already on the Court.

**Barack to the Future**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**In his first major speech of this year’s midterm campaign season, President Obama finally broke his silence about Donald Trump’s presidency,** characterizing his corruption, authoritarianism, and general terribleness as “a symptom, not the cause” of resentments the Republican Party has been “fanning for years.” Trump and Republicans used the occasion to make Obama’s point for him.       
               
**Here are some speech highlights, juxtaposed with things Trump and Republicans did and said today**.       
               
**[Obama](https://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/obama-university-of-illinois-full-speech-492719531.html?h_sid=30a7476842-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84): “It should not be a partisan issue to say that we do not pressure the attorney general** or the FBI to use the criminal justice system as a cudgel to punish our political opponents.”       
               
**[Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/us/politics/trump-investigation-times-op-ed.html?h_sid=30a7476842-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84): “I would say [Attorney General] Jeff [Sessions] should be investigating who the author of the piece was** because I really believe it’s national security.”       
               
**[Obama](https://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/obama-university-of-illinois-full-speech-492719531.html?h_sid=30a7476842-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84): “We don’t threaten the freedom of the press** because they say things or publish stories we don’t like.”       
               
**Trump: “I’m looking at [whether action should be taken against the New York Times]** right now.”       
               
**[Obama](https://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/obama-university-of-illinois-full-speech-492719531.html?h_sid=30a7476842-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84): “What happened to the Republican Party? Its central organizing principle in foreign policy was the fight against communism,** and now they’re cozying up to the former head of the KGB, actively blocking legislation that would defend our elections from Russian attack.”       
               
**[Republicans](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/us/politics/house-hacked-materials.html?h_sid=30a7476842-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84): “…withdrew on Thursday from negotiations with Democrats over a pact that would have effectively barred both parties from using hacked or stolen material** on the campaign trail this fall.”       
               
**[Obama](https://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/obama-university-of-illinois-full-speech-492719531.html?h_sid=30a7476842-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84): “Demagogues…appeal to racial nationalism** that’s barely veiled, if veiled at all.”       
               
**[Trump](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1038018199449567232): “What was Nike thinking?”**       
               
**From Brian:** I don’t have anything particularly insightful to add, I just think it’s hilarious that Obama could have picked literally any day of any week to finally say what he thinks about the Trump presidency, and Trump would have said and done *something* to underscore how right Obama was about what an ass Trump is.

Later, when questioned under oath about those stolen documents, he claimed to have been completely unaware of the thefts. Now we know he was lying. After his confirmation hearings this week, we also know he may have perjured himself on [several other occasions](https://www.thedailybeast.com/newly-released-emails-show-brett-kavanaugh-may-have-perjured-himself-at-least-four-times?h_sid=30a7476842-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).

**A District Attorney in Nashville announced this week that his office will no longer prosecute certain drivers license violations, which will [keep an estimated 12,000 cases out of city courts](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/crime/2018/09/04/drivers-license-violations-nashville-glenn-funk-steering-clear/1161034002/?h_sid=30a7476842-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) over the next year.** In addition to saving the city time and money, this move will keep thousands of people who would otherwise unnecessarily become a part of the criminal justice system out of it—saving them time, money, and the consequences of criminal charges. Instead, offenders will be directed to a sheriff’s office program to help them get their licenses reinstated, and ultimately fewer people will be driving illegally. This is smart policy and why it’s so important to vote in district attorneys races!

**Lying About Your Stock Size**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is [under scrutiny](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/7/17829320/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-hearing-perjury?h_sid=6b387ebbcb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21364&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) again after misleading senators during his confirmation hearings,** and a [huge hurricane](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/10/us/florence-hurricane-season-wxc/index.html?h_sid=6b387ebbcb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21364&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) is bearing down on the east coast, so naturally the president kicked off the week by publicly nursing a variety of personal grudges.       
               
**Trump is primarily consumed with President Obama’s return to the political spotlight** and his success reminding the public that Trump’s main accomplishment as president has been to rebrand the economic recovery Obama oversaw. (It’s an easy message to sell: The economic growth Trump has presided over is more or less [the same across all measures](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/fact-check-economy-booming-who-gets-credit-trump-or-obama-n908286?h_sid=6b387ebbcb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21364&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) as the economic growth Obama handed off to him, but with healthy dash of [increased income inequality](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-economic-agenda-is-exacerbating-americas-inequality-crisis-2018-8?h_sid=6b387ebbcb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21364&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive).)       
               
**To ease this psychic wound, Trump has tweeted out lies about the economy he inherited, lies about the economy as it is today,** and dispatched Kevin Hassett, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, to give reporters a dishonest briefing about the differences between the two presidents’ records (though even Hassett [couldn’t defend](https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/1039223775265472512) all the lies).       
               
**Trump also remains triggered by the [journalist Bob Woodward](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/woodward-mattis-kelly-denials-book-quotes-untrue-57723585?h_sid=6b387ebbcb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21364&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), whose new book, *Fear*, depicts Trump as a racist and ignorant blowhard,** temperamentally and intellectually unfit for office, who places the country in grave danger simply by being president. He has called Woodward (who almost surely has recordings and notes to back up all of his reporting) a “joke” and a “liar” and sent White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders to the briefing room for the first time in three weeks to attack him.       
               
**Sanders also renewed Trump’s demand that the Justice Department investigate the anonymous Trump official who wrote last week’s *New York Times* [op-ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html?h_sid=6b387ebbcb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21364&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;module=Uisil&amp;utm_source=hive)** portraying Trump, similarly, as an amoral liar surrounded by disloyal aides who don’t think twice about ignoring his reckless orders. (The op-ed is constitutionally protected speech, and neither its author nor the *Times* committed a crime by publishing it.)       
               
**From Brian:** The media’s continuing obsession with Trump’s base masks how badly Trump’s lack of character and awful temperament have damaged him. The fact that he hasn’t squandered the economy he inherited would be all he needed to coast through a successful first term if he weren’t a fundamentally bad person. Instead, he limps along with [sub-40 percent approval ratings](https://twitter.com/ThePlumLineGS/status/1039246484661854208), and extraordinarily high unfavorables, with the vast majority of the public under the correct impression that he’s a liar. It all matters.       
               
**What Else**

**President Trump will reportedly [declassify sensitive Justice Department documents](https://www.axios.com/trump-declassify-carter-page-bruce-ohr-documents-307ff599-df29-49db-ae01-a8b027908b12.html?h_sid=6b387ebbcb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21364&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive)** regarding government surveillance of his former campaign aide/Russian intelligence asset Carter Page to sow more confusion among his supporters about the legitimacy of the Russia investigation. We have lost count of the number of times Trump has manipulated intelligence for political purposes, but don’t worry—so have Republicans in Congress who pretend not to notice. Ooh! Ooh!

**Yesterday, CNN’s [Fareed Zakaria](https://twitter.com/CNNnewsroom/status/1038802279338467328) dismissed criticism of his decision to host failed former White House strategist/white nationalist blowhard Steve Bannon on his show earlier this year,** saying "Liberals need to understand that if they don't listen to people like Steve Bannon, those people don't disappear. It just means liberals will keep being surprised by election results.”       
               
**Liberals have mostly just been critical of news outlets that invite Bannon to headline public events,** and reporters who let him spew unfiltered propaganda on live television, not of reporting on him and his movement, but that strawman wasn’t going to take itself down.

**Woodward and Burn Scene**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Three of Bob Woodward’s four chattiest sources have made public statements denouncing his new book, *Fear*,** which depicts Donald Trump as a lying racist who’s outmatched by the job. (Checks out.)       
               
**But their statements don’t actually *dispute* the contents of the book:**       
               
**Former White House Staff Secretary/spousal abuser [Rob Porter](https://www.axios.com/rob-porter-bob-woodward-book-fear-donald-trump-9f4f42a2-cc6d-475c-810f-e84fee36d79a.html?h_sid=9fe06b33ea-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=alerts_politics&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;stream=politics&amp;utm_source=alert)** cautions that “the suggestion that materials were ‘stolen’ from the President’s desk to prevent his signature misunderstands how the White House document review process works.” He does not deny that people might have circumvented the process by removing documents from the president’s desk.       
               
**Trump’s former chief economic adviser [Gary Cohn](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/11/woodwards-grim-portrait-trumps-white-house-gets-vote-confidence-via-two-non-denial-denials/?h_sid=9fe06b33ea-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.ce7f03ae7dfe&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21406&amp;noredirect=on) says, "This book does not accurately portray my experience at the White House.”** He doesn’t even pretend to take issue with any of the factual claims Woodward makes.       
               
**Trump’s former criminal defense lawyer [John Dowd](http://time.com/5386203/donald-trump-jay-sekulow-john-dowd-mock-interview/?h_sid=9fe06b33ea-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21406&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), said,** “there was no so-called ‘practice session’ or ‘re-enactment’ of a mock interview at the Special Counsel’s office.” But Dowd doesn’t claim that he never prepped Trump for an interview with Mueller.       
               
**From Brian:** That Woodward’s main sources realize they can appease Trump by issuing statements that don’t actually deny the book’s claims confirms one of the book’s broader themes, and one of the greatest dangers of his presidency: [Trump](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1039111866956566528) is both practically illiterate, and a sucker for flattery, which means he’s frequently a mark, but never realizes it.

**Meanwhile, on the federal level, the EPA wants to [make it easier for fossil fuel industries to release methane into the atmosphere](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/10/climate/methane-emissions-epa.html?h_sid=9fe06b33ea-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21406&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;smid=tw-nytimes)—the Trump administration’s third major attack on Obama-era climate change-mitigating regulations.** The proposal would weaken requirements on companies to monitor and repair leaks of the greenhouse gas.

**Facebook has allowed the *Weekly Standard*, a right-wing magazine, to effectively censor *ThinkProgress*, a progressive news site.**       
               
**In response to bad-faith, right-wing accusations that social media companies favor and promote liberal voices,** Facebook began allowing non-ideological fact-checking organizations like *Snopes*, and one right-wing outlet—the *Weekly Standard*—to fact check articles shared on the platform. No left-leaning outlets are part of Facebook’s fact-checking process. The *Weekly Standard* quickly abused this power, labeling a *ThinkProgress* story, which persuasively demonstrated that Brett Kavanaugh revealed his opposition to *Roe v. Wade* “false”—drastically reducing traffic to *ThinkProgress* from Facebook, and redirecting it to the *Weekly Standard*.

**Little Failures Everywhere**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Republicans in Congress—even the ones who’ve talked a good game about Russian interference in the 2016 election**—are still trying to help President Trump cover up his potential crimes.       
               
**On Fox News this morning, [Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC)](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1039877857441402882)**—who is overseeing Congress’s only non-dysfunctional Russia investigation—said this: “I can say, as it relates to the Senate Intelligence Committee investigation, that we have no hard evidence of collusion.” Trump quickly seized on it, and tweeted it out to his millions of followers.       
               
**Burr’s statement is wildly misleading, if not completely false.** He allowed, [as he has in the past](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-bc-us--russia-probe-senate-20180817-story.html?h_sid=81d7409c80-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21449&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), that his investigation is ongoing, so he might discover evidence of collusion in the future. But he ignores [all the public evidence of collusion](https://www.vox.com/2018/6/11/17438386/trump-russia-collusion?h_sid=81d7409c80-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21449&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) between the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence, including the [Trump Tower meeting](https://www.vox.com/2018/2/26/16964328/trump-tower-meeting-mueller-russia?h_sid=81d7409c80-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21449&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) between senior Trump advisers and Russian agents promising dirt on Hillary Clinton, and [George Papadopoulos](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/12/papadopoulos-congress-testify-816830?h_sid=81d7409c80-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21449&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), who was just sentenced to federal prison for lying to FBI investigators about Russians offering the campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton.       
               
**He also omits any evidence of collusion that Burr and his investigators might be aware of, and simply not pursued.** [*Buzzfeed*](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/anthonycormier/trump-tower-meeting-suspicious-transactions-agalarov?h_sid=81d7409c80-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21449&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), for instance, has reported that federal investigators are scrutinizing large transfers of money among “some of the planners and participants” in the Trump Tower meeting. Independent journalist/Friend of the Pod Marcy Wheeler, who became an FBI informant when she believed she had evidence of a conspiracy between Trump and Russia, also spoke to Senate investigators, and [tweeted](https://twitter.com/emptywheel/status/1039906944482516993) “I can say with 100% certainty, SSCI is not pursuing evidence of ‘collusion’ they have heard about.”       
               
**We asked Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) whether he agrees with Burr’s assessment,** and whether the committee has pursued all possible evidence of collusion. "Let's just look at what’s in the public domain,” he told Crooked Media. “We have the senior leadership of the campaign meeting with Russians in Trump Tower to get dirt on Hillary Clinton; We have a professor in London with ties to Russian intelligence sharing with a Trump official that the Russians have 'thousands of emails' on Hillary Clinton – after the e-mails had [been] stolen but before they were in the public; and we have Roger Stone in touch directly with Wikileaks... The list goes on and on. The President can keep tweeting NO COLLUSION but that completely ignores what's staring all of us in the face."       
               
**From Brian:** The only way to guarantee that Burr's committee or any congressional committee will actually undertake a thorough Russia investigation is to flip control of Congress. Every political actor helping Republicans win or keep their seats—whether it’s [George W. Bush](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/12/17850382/bush-midterms-census?h_sid=81d7409c80-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21449&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) or [No Labels](https://twitter.com/DavidWright_CNN/status/1039900869809106944) or (unbelievably) [Rep.

**From Brian:** To the extent that there’s a “blame game” at all, it is because 3,000 citizens who could have been rescued died, and Republicans in Congress refused to hold a single oversight hearing about it, suggesting they believe a full accounting will reflect poorly on their government. We don’t know how avoidable this horrific death toll was, and unless Democrats win control of at least one chamber of Congress, we never will.

**Happy Friday! Everyone's Guilty.**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**After holding out for nearly a year, President Trump’s former campaign chairman/convicted felon [Paul Manafort struck a plea agreement with the government](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/14/us/politics/manafort-plea-deal.html?h_sid=21ec2f4f49-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21528&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive),** requiring him to cooperate fully with federal prosecutors, including Special Counsel Robert Mueller. He has reportedly [already begun sharing information](https://twitter.com/rgoodlaw/status/1040625381244588033) with the Justice Department. Looks like snitches get stitches (beautifully sewn into an ostrich jacket).       
               
**Trump has done a poor job hiding the fact that he believes Manafort can implicate him in crimes** and has publicly encouraged Manafort not to cooperate with Mueller’s team, clearly implying he’d eventually reward Manafort with a pardon.       
               
**Manafort apparently concluded he could not depend on Trump, and agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States,** and to obstruct justice. He said he did so to [protect his family](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/latest-manafort-expected-plead-guilty-deal-57823798?h_sid=21ec2f4f49-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21528&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive). Even when he does the less-wrong thing, Manafort still sounds like a mobster.       
               
**The [plea agreement](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/14/17861014/manafort-plea-deal-read-full-text-pdf-trump-russia-mueller-investigation?h_sid=21ec2f4f49-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21528&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) leaves Manafort’s alleged financial crimes uncharged, which means he may still face criminal exposure at the state level.** This is notable because Trump can only pardon him for his federal crimes. The agreement also requires Manafort to surrender his significant, ill-gotten fortune, which will more than cover the cost of Mueller’s entire investigation. Maybe now the government can finally turn the garage into a rumpus room like they always wanted!!       
               
**President Trump’s lawyers [issued a statement](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/14/17860956/manafort-plea-deal-mueller-trump-giuliani-statement?h_sid=21ec2f4f49-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21528&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) after the agreement became public, which read, “the President did nothing wrong and Paul Manafort will tell the truth.”** They quickly amended the statement to simply claim, “the President did nothing wrong,” suggesting they believe Manafort will incriminate Trump, and they will respond by calling him a liar. It’s sometimes baffling just how bad they are at crimes.       
               
**From Brian:** Manafort joined Trump’s campaign after his gravy train, consulting on behalf of a pro-Russian party in Ukraine, dried up. He was in league with Russian intelligence and deeply in debt to a Russian oligarch, yet eagerly pursued a leadership role in Trump’s campaign and agreed to work for free. The case that he was a Russian agent of influence planted in Trump’s campaign is easy to make. A big unanswered question is why, having nabbed Manafort on serious crimes, Mueller worked so hard to flip him. One simple answer is that Mueller believes Trump knew that Manafort was a conduit for Russian election assistance, and that Manafort can substantiate it.       
               
**Ronan is Watching You**

**A woman who knew Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when the two attended rival high schools says [he tried to force himself on her at a party](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-sexual-misconduct-allegation-against-the-supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaugh-stirs-tension-among-democrats-in-congress?h_sid=21ec2f4f49-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21528&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive)** and covered her mouth to prevent her from screaming, while a classmate of his turned up the music playing in the room to drown out her protests, according to Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer of the *New Yorker*.       
               
**The allegation first appeared in a letter the accuser wrote to members of Congress,** which eventually reached Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein. Feinstein alerted the FBI, which is responsible for running background checks on the president's nominees, but decided to conceal the allegation from her colleagues because the accuser has asked for privacy.       
               
**Kavanaugh has “categorically and unequivocally den[ied] this allegation,” and insists he “did not do this back in high school or at any time.”** The classmate who allegedly abetted the incident only said, “I have no recollection of that.” Sounds convincing.       
               
**As the allegations surfaced, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley released a [letter signed by 65 women who claim to have known Kavanaugh in high school](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/14/17860488/brett-kavanaugh-sexual-assault-georgetown-prep-defense?h_sid=21ec2f4f49-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=vox&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=chorus)** attesting to his character, suggesting many Republicans are inclined to press ahead with the nomination, despite the accusation. (This is like 65 friends of OJ Simpson releasing a letter saying “Well, OJ never murdered *me*.”)       
               
**From Brian:** The organizers of the Kavanaugh-support letter claim they began gathering signatures this week, when news of the assault allegation broke. Their efforts are self-undermining, insofar as none of them were Kavanaugh’s classmates (he attended an all-boys school), and they are trying to get him confirmed.       
               
**Also from Brian:** Only in Trump’s America is an allegation that a Supreme Court nominee sexually assaulted a classmate not the leading news story of the day, week, and month.

**Senate Confronts Kavanaugh Allegations**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Brett Kavanaugh stands credibly accused of attempting to rape [Dr. Christine Blasey Ford](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/california-professor-writer-of-confidential-brett-kavanaugh-letter-speaks-out-about-her-allegation-of-sexual-assault/2018/09/16/46982194-b846-11e8-94eb-3bd52dfe917b_story.html?h_sid=5d8bd58afb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.b04500a4f2c3&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21583&amp;noredirect=on)** when the two were at a small gathering of high school students in the early 1980s. Her decision to attach her name and voice to the allegation, and to testify to the Senate about the incident, has placed Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination in serious jeopardy.       
               
**Most Republicans appear inclined to forge ahead with their plan to confirm Kavanaugh by early next month.** Senate Majority Leader [Mitch McConnell ranted dishonestly](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/17/17871402/mitch-mcconnell-democrats-brett-kavanaugh-accusations-feinstein?h_sid=5d8bd58afb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21583&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) on the Senate floor about Democrats’ role in surfacing the allegation. [Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT)](https://twitter.com/laurenegambino/status/1041759000910614528), said even if Kavanaugh assaulted Ford “I think it would be hard for senators to not consider who the judge is today. That’s the issue. Is this judge a really good man? And he is.”       
               
**However, multiple Republicans, including Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Bob Corker (R-TN), and Jeff Flake (R-AZ), called upon Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley to [delay the vote](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/16/politics/jeff-flake-bob-corker-brett-kavanaugh/index.html?h_sid=5d8bd58afb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21583&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive)** on whether to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination to the full Senate. Grassley has obliged, and intends to [hold a public hearing with both Ford and Kavanagh](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/17/us/politics/kavanaugh-allegations-ford-palo-alto.html?utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21583&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=Top+Stories&amp;h_sid=5d8bd58afb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;action=click) next Monday.       
               
**According to [*Axios*](https://www.axios.com/brett-kavanaugh-confirmation-strategy-sexual-assault-allegations-5dc354ff-73d6-49f0-b5b4-5971b6a76051.html?h_sid=5d8bd58afb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21583&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), Republicans believed they could bluff Ford into declining their invitation by insisting she testify right away.** She has called their bluff, which is good, but that doesn’t make Republicans’ efforts to intimidate her back into silence any less disgusting.       
               
**[President Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/17/trump-on-kavanaugh-if-it-takes-a-little-delay-thats-ok-.html?h_sid=5d8bd58afb-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21583&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) has, somewhat surprisingly, accepted “a little delay,” for a “full process” to “hear everybody out.”** But the conservative media is gearing up to smear Ford, and Kavanaugh himself is encouraging it by denying not just that he assaulted her, but that he was even at the gathering where the alleged assault occurred.       
               
**From Brian:** This story is evolving very rapidly, and it’s hard to say where it’s heading next, let alone how it will end. But Kavanaugh’s denial deserves scrutiny beyond the fact that he’s disputing the assault allegation. Ford has also recalled that one of Kavanaugh’s friends, Mark Judge, witnessed the incident, and that four others were in attendance at the party—some of whom she says spoke with Kavanaugh after the attack. He is going in all in on a bet that nobody will corroborate that part of Ford’s account.

Grassley has also stipulated that the Senate will only [speak to two witnesses](https://twitter.com/Phil_Mattingly/status/1042029347392180224): Ford and Kavanaugh.       
               
**Grassley could easily wait for an updated background check. He could also easily invite Kavanaugh’s friend Mark Judge, who allegedly witnessed the incident;** the other teenagers who were at the same gathering; and Ford’s friends and therapist, with whom she discussed the incident prior to Kavanaugh’s nomination to testify as well. But he refuses to take either step, and refuses to explain why.       
               
**However the hearing shakes out, Republicans are already laying the groundwork to support Kavanaugh:**       
                
- [Trump](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/18/politics/trump-kavanaugh-testimony/index.html?h_sid=699123454a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21641&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) said Kavanaugh is “not a man who deserves this.”       
                
- GOP judicial operative [Carrie Severino](https://twitter.com/CNNnewsroom/status/1042120034129080320) said the incident Ford describes might qualify as “rough horseplay.”       
               
- [Grassley](https://twitter.com/benyc/status/1042049695630192640) said, “I’d hate to…have somebody ask me what I did 35 years ago.” (He was serving as a U.S. Senator.)       
               
**Republicans are offering a buffet of excuses:** He didn’t do it, but if he did do it, it might have been [rough housing](https://www.businessinsider.com/brett-kavanaugh-allegations-sexual-assault-judicial-crisis-network-2018-9?h_sid=699123454a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21641&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive). And even if it was attempted rape, it was a [long time ago](https://twitter.com/laurenegambino/status/1041759000910614528). What matters is marching toward confirmation, not assessing the truth of whether Kavanaugh deserves a seat on the highest court, or if he’s a serial liar credibly accused of sexual assault. It’s pure partisanship and the desire to win at all costs.       
               
**From Brian:** The subtext of the Republican response to the Kavanaugh allegation—from trying to rig the Senate inquiry, to their conflicting arguments about the significance of Kavanaugh’s guilt or innocence—is that they aren’t confident in his denial. At all. Republicans are currently at risk of losing not just a fifth anti-abortion justice, but Congress, and possibly the entire Trump presidency. They are doing whatever they can to stave off a worst-case scenario, and that includes this grotesque abuse of power aimed at silencing and discrediting Christine Blasey Ford on behalf of a man they believe may have assaulted her.

**Some Republicans would like to ignore Ford altogether and confirm Kavanaugh along party lines [as soon as possible](https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1042379620149026817).** [Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2018/09/19/daily-202-senate-republicans-playing-hardball-with-accuser-in-push-to-swiftly-confirm-kavanaugh/5ba1b8b31b326b47ec9596ea/?h_sid=4698ab0024-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21705&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;noredirect=on) said, “I’ll listen to the lady, but we’re going to bring this to a close,” adding, "we run the committee—not her lawyer, not the Democrats.” (Charming.)       
               
**Others believe Republicans must at least appear interested in getting to the truth.** The party has unified behind the gross “compromise” strategy of offering Ford a [no-win, take-it-or-leave it proposition](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/19/republicans-turn-up-pressure-on-kavanaugh-accuser-ford-to-testify.html?h_sid=4698ab0024-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21705&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive): Testify by Monday, or you’ll lose your one and only chance to share your story and have no one to blame but yourself.       
               
**Wavering Republicans, including Sens. [Susan Collins (R-ME)](https://twitter.com/SenatorCollins/status/1042463394509598721) and [Jeff Flake (R-AZ)](https://twitter.com/JeffFlake/status/1042259571463471109), have embraced this pressure tactic:**       
               
- “I hope that Dr. Ford will reconsider and testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday,” Collins tweeted.       
               
- “When Dr. Ford came forward, I said that her voice should be heard and asked the Judiciary Committee to delay its vote on Judge Kavanaugh,” Flake added. “It did so. I now implore Dr. Ford to accept the invitation for Monday.”       
               
**Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman [Chuck Grassley](https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/1042462569334800384) has given Ford until 10 a.m. on Friday to submit her prepared testimony and biography** if she intends to testify. The conservative *National Review*, which is the house organ of the institutional right wing, was more explicit, [arguing](https://twitter.com/NRO/status/1042455812822712320) that Republicans should give her essentially no time at all, and get Kavanaugh’s confirmation schedule back on track.       
               
**This framing omits the fact that they are trying to coerce Ford, an alleged sexual assault survivor, into either appearing at a rigged hearing or seeing her allegations discarded altogether.** Republicans are refusing to invite corroborating witnesses to testify, and have declined Ford’s request to postpone the hearing until the FBI conducts a background investigation of the incident, as it did when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment in 1991. Their hope is that she will reject their invitation so they can pretend they gave her every opportunity to be heard, and she left them no choice but to proceed with the nomination.       
               
**Ford’s lawyer has since [issued a statement](https://twitter.com/Phil_Mattingly/status/1042541960689532934):** “Dr. Ford was reluctantly thrust into the public spotlight only two days ago… fairness and respect for her situation dictate that she should have time to deal with this. She continues to believe that a full non-partisan investigation of this matter is needed and she is willing to cooperate with the Committee.... The rush to a hearing is unnecessary and contrary to the Committee discovering the truth.”       
               
**From Brian:** The Senate and Ford could still reach a compromise. [Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL)](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/18/politics/doug-jones-mark-judge-cnntv/index.html?h_sid=4698ab0024-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21705&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) has suggested that the Judiciary Committee subpoena Kavanaugh’s friend, Mark Judge, whom Ford places at the scene of the alleged assault. Collins has suggested [getting the FBI involved after she testifies](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/collins-if-we-need-additional-help-from-the-fbi-we-can-ask-for-it-after-a-hearing?h_sid=4698ab0024-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21705&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) to the committee. But if they can’t reach an accommodation, Republicans appear poised to go all in on Kavanaugh, without knowing what other cards Ford has to play, or what other shoes might drop.       
               
**From Priyanka:** Watching Republican senators try to bully Dr. Ford onto their timeline so they can get Kavanaugh confirmed before the midterms is truly disgusting.

Ads like this have been illegal since 1973. (It also feels like Facebook has been on apology tour since then.)       
               
**Trump revealed that he [decided to declassify documents](https://twitter.com/MattGertz/status/1042489589900955648) related to the ongoing investigation of his campaign’s ties to Russian intelligence** at the behest of Fox hosts Lou Dobbs, Sean Hannity, and Jeanine Pirro, aka next year’s cabinet.

(1momjourney2fit IG)](https://twitter.com/humorandanimals/status/1041678262257299457)"***"That is such bullshit I can't hardly stand it."—[Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI)](https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1042782988583534593) on Republicans claiming they’ve done everything they can to accommodate Dr. Christine Blasey Ford*       
               
**Ford to Testify**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Dr. Christine Blasey Ford will [testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee next week](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/20/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-christine-blasey.html?h_sid=b1e2036aff-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21763&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive),** provided she and Senate Republicans “agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety,” her lawyer wrote to Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley on Thursday.       
               
**Though she has ruled out the Monday appearance Republicans have insisted upon,** Ford is *not* demanding that the committee request a completed FBI background investigation of her allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh before her appearance. Such an investigation, according to her lawyer, is merely “her strong preference.”       
               
**Ford’s agreement to testify, demanding only security and a few extra days to prepare, is not what some Republicans were hoping for:** “[S]everal top GOP lawmakers have told colleagues that they hope Ford declines to show up for the hearing even as they issue statements urging her to do so,” [reported the *Washington Post*’s Robert Costa](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-push-to-confirm-kavanaugh-amid-fears-it-will-come-at-a-political-cost/2018/09/19/4ca5d956-bc23-11e8-b7d2-0773aa1e33da_story.html?h_sid=b1e2036aff-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.e6f4e98e4b2a&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21763&amp;noredirect=on), “helping the GOP avoid a risky televised drama and making it easier for Senate leaders to hold a vote next week.”       
               
**Still, the terms Ford is proposing remain tilted against her.** Republicans [refuse to request a background investigation](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/20/17879284/democrats-fbi-investigation-kavanaugh?h_sid=b1e2036aff-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21763&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) or [invite witnesses to testify](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gop-vows-to-move-ahead-with-kavanaugh-vote-if-his-accuser-doesnt-testify-monday/2018/09/20/a7132ee8-bcf5-11e8-8792-78719177250f_story.html?h_sid=b1e2036aff-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.5cdfb81f0fb0&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21763). They are making the truth as hard as possible to discern, and have made it clear that no matter what, they want to charge ahead with Kavanaugh’s confirmation.       
               
**From Brian:** The hearing taking shape is actually more tilted against Ford than the one Anita Hill testified at in 1991. The FBI investigated Hill’s accusation that then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas sexually harassed her, and the committee accepted testimony from multiple witnesses. The one thing Ford has working to her advantage is a crystalizing public sense that Republicans are trying to sabotage her. They haven’t taken any obvious steps that would help the Senate get to the truth. Multiple Republican senators have already impugned her and her motives. Late on Thursday, Grassley’s [chief counsel for nominations Mike Davis tweeted](https://twitter.com/brianbeutler/status/1042713761742835712) “Unfazed and determined. We will confirm Judge Kavanaugh.” Davis deleted the tweets and took his account private briefly, once he realized he’d given away the game. But the fact that Republicans have rigged the process to reach the outcome they want, at Ford’s expense, should be a key theme of news coverage of this story, Democratic questioning, and her testimony.

Cohen later [tweeted a message praising and tagging himself](https://twitter.com/meridithmcgraw/status/1042926225646206977) for cooperating, which he quickly deleted, presumably because he meant to send it from a burner account.

Is anyone surprised? The raises brought the appointees’ salaries to between $98,000-$155,000, though three of the five don’t list bachelor’s degrees on their resumes. At least 24 people without relevant experience have been hired to the department’s highest paying political positions.

**Bad Punditry**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The award for the grossest and most irresponsible Brett Kavanaugh take goes to his friend Ed Whelan,** a prominent conservative and founder of the inaptly named Ethics and Public Policy Center, who suggested that someone who looks like Brett Kavanaugh might be the real culprit. He did this on Twitter. He used floor plans, maps, and yearbook pictures. We won’t link to it.       
               
**But the *Washington Post*, which should have higher standards than a right wing activist, [gets an honorable mention](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/is-there-a-kavanaugh-doppelganger/2018/09/18/88418f52-bb86-11e8-a8aa-860695e7f3fc_story.html?h_sid=b1e2036aff-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21763&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive)** for publishing Kathleen Parker’s column ”Is there a Kavanaugh doppelganger?”       
               
**“Could there have been another, Kavanaugh-ish-looking teen at the house that night, who might have attacked Ford?,”** she asks. “In a case without evidence, witnesses or corroboration, mistaken identity would provide a welcome resolution to this terrible riddle.”       
               
**Parker isn’t subtle about why she’s speculating so wildly—she seeks a “welcome resolution” to Republicans’ Kavanaugh woes.** But it’s insulting to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford to insinuate that she is mistaken in her allegations, it’s insulting to readers who turn to the *Post*’s opinion section to be exposed to ideas that meaningfully contribute to discourse, and it’s insulting to me (Priyanka), who had to waste precious minutes of my life reading this trash.       
               
**From Brian:** Parker apparently did not stop to ask herself why, when Ford came forward, Kavanaugh didn’t say “I’ve never met Dr. Ford,” but rather ‘I wasn’t there.’ The reason? [Ford and Kavanaugh knew each other](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/us/politics/christine-blasey-ford-brett-kavanaugh-allegations.html?h_sid=b1e2036aff-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21763&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) before the night of the alleged incident. She didn’t just put forth an irresponsible theory without evidence behind it, she put forth an irresponsible theory that the evidence points against. The *Post* should never have run this.

**Spinning Whelan**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The right’s efforts to get Brett Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court, despite facing a credible sexual assault allegation,** unraveled dramatically over the past 24 hours.       
               
**It came to a head in a [now-deleted tweet storm](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/20/17885050/ed-whelan-kavanaugh-christine-blasey-ford-accusation?h_sid=d950e8c6b5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21821&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) by Kavanaugh’s friend, the Republican legal operative Ed Whelan,** who promoted the theory that Kavanaugh’s accuser, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, might have misremembered the identity of her attacker. In the thread, Whelan named and posted photos of one of Kavanaugh’s high school classmates, suggesting he might be the real attempted rapist, on the grounds that he and Kavanaugh looked somewhat alike.       
               
**In addition to being defamatory, this effort to exonerate Kavanaugh was easily debunked.** [Ford knew both Kavanaugh and the man Whelan defamed](https://twitter.com/emmersbrown/status/1042941677537779713) before the alleged incident, and even remained friends with the latter into adulthood. “There is zero chance that I would confuse them,” [Ford said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gop-vows-to-move-ahead-with-kavanaugh-vote-if-his-accuser-doesnt-testify-monday/2018/09/20/a7132ee8-bcf5-11e8-8792-78719177250f_story.html?h_sid=d950e8c6b5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.bf1fe83fc76d&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21821&amp;noredirect=on). The mistaken identity theory is top to bottom garbage.       
               
**Whelan’s gambit didn’t just fail—it backfired. That’s because Whelan isn’t just a random conservative,** but the Republican Party’s [go to guy in judicial confirmation fights](https://twitter.com/SteveSchmidtSES/status/1042995743768731648). His involvement raises important questions about how involved Senate Republicans, the White House, and even Kavanaugh himself were in cooking up this alternate hypothesis.       
               
- **Kavanaugh apparently [began teasing the mistaken identity theory](https://www.yahoo.com/news/kavanaugh-tells-hatch-accusation-may-201746510.html?h_sid=d950e8c6b5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21821&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) early this week in meetings with Republican lawmakers.** Are he and his peers conceding that the party—which they all claimed not to recall—happened after all?       
               
- **Whelan’s conspiracy theory relied heavily on information about Kavanaugh’s social circle in high school.** Did he get that information from Kavanaugh directly? From other people who were at the gathering where the assault allegedly occurred?       
               
- **It also contained details that had not been made public, including identifying information about an unnamed partygoer.** Who gave him *that* information? And how involved were they in helping Whelan put together his theory?       
               
- **The mistaken identity theory [spread](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-metoo-kavanaugh-ambush-1537197395?h_sid=d950e8c6b5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21821&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) through [conservative media](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/is-there-a-kavanaugh-doppelganger/2018/09/18/88418f52-bb86-11e8-a8aa-860695e7f3fc_story.html?h_sid=d950e8c6b5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.a4acad147d28&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21821) earlier this week, in advance of Whelan’s “big reveal.”** Who in Republican politics was feeding those stories?       
               
**As Team Kavanaugh was self-immolating, Ford was negotiating the terms of her possible testimony next week.** The combination of developments drove Trump into a long-expected meltdown, during which he [attacked Ford directly](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1043126336473055235) for the first time. Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), who remains undecided about Kavanaugh [claimed](https://www.pressherald.com/2018/09/21/collins-appalled-by-trumps-tweet-criticizing-kavanaugh-accuser/?h_sid=d950e8c6b5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21821&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) to be “appalled” by Trump’s Friday tweets.       
               
**From Brian:** Republicans were trying to impeach Ford’s testimony before she could give it, and, now that their efforts have backfired, are going to great lengths to conceal their involvement, including [deleting tweets](https://twitter.com/JesseCharlesLee/status/1042965916248694791) suggesting advanced knowledge of what Whelan was up to. Their insistence on not inviting any witnesses to appear alongside Ford and Kavanaugh means Whelan will never have to testify about his involvement under oath. Getting at that backstory should be a major focus for Democrats—otherwise, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell [said Friday](https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1043154728870400000), Republicans will “plow right through it” and confirm Kavanaugh under a cloud of suspicion.       
               
**Guns N Rosenstein**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Someone is trying to provide Donald Trump cover to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein,** who oversees Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.       
               
**On Friday afternoon, the *New York Times* [reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/us/politics/rod-rosenstein-wear-wire-25th-amendment.html?h_sid=d950e8c6b5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21821&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) that, amid the chaos after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey,** Rosenstein privately suggested recording Trump without his knowledge to document the White House’s dysfunction, and even discussed recruiting cabinet officials to invoke the 25th Amendment—a provision of the constitution that allows the Vice President and members of the cabinet to begin the process of removing the president from office.       
               
**Rumors about senior Trump aides discussing the 25th amendment have swirled since the beginning of Trump’s presidency,** most recently in journalist Bob Woodward’s new book, and an infamous [*New York Times* column](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html?h_sid=d950e8c6b5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21821&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) by an unnamed official. Rosenstein becomes the first official to have his name attached to those rumors.       
               
**Former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who was fired several months ago, memorialized Rosenstein’s comments contemporaneously,** and that memo, which he left behind at the FBI, has become the source of competing interpretations of what Rosenstein meant.       
               
**[Sources who were in the meeting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/mccabe-memos-say-rosenstein-considered-secretly-recording-trump/2018/09/21/f4aa9a62-bdca-11e8-8792-78719177250f_story.html?h_sid=d950e8c6b5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.29ddb2015328&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21821) contend that Rosenstein didn’t discuss the 25th amendment,** and that he only sarcastically suggested recording Trump when McCabe suggested opening a criminal investigation of the president: “What do you want to do, Andy, wire the president?”       
               
**From Brian:** Rosenstein may have enough cover to weather this storm—even as Trump’s own advisers [intend to use it as a pretext to fire him](https://twitter.com/gabrielsherman/status/1043212861739294722). What’s clear, regardless of what happened in May 2017, is that the actors in Republican politics who want to shut down the Mueller investigation are getting increasingly desperate, and increasingly aggressive.       
               
**What Else**

**Dr. Christine Blasey Ford [met with authorities from the FBI](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-questions-credibility-of-kavanaugh-accuser-lashes-out-at-democrats/2018/09/21/dd557fc6-bd84-11e8-b7d2-0773aa1e33da_story.html?h_sid=d950e8c6b5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.e4ba5ab43f6a&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21821&amp;tid=ss_tw&amp;utm_source=hive) this afternoon as part of an investigation of death threats she has received** in the past week, after attaching her name to her allegation that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in the 1980s. This investigation will not touch upon the alleged assault.

Great judgment all around.

Last year, overdoses killed more than 70,000 people in the U.S., and opioids are currently the leading cause of overdose deaths.

**Hold My Smear**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Now that [multiple women](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/senate-democrats-investigate-a-new-allegation-of-sexual-misconduct-from-the-supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaughs-college-years-deborah-ramirez?h_sid=9ec53bd19d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21885&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) are accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting them in his youth,** he and his Republican supporters are stepping up efforts to smear the women, even as his confirmation seems increasingly in doubt.       
               
**Kavanaugh’s second accuser is Deborah Ramirez, a college classmate of his who claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her,** and caused her to touch his penis, at a Yale University drinking party their freshman year. Ramirez told her story to the *New Yorker*, which also tracked down a classmate who recalled hearing about the incident at the time. (None of the *New Yorker*’s sources, other than Ramirez, claim to have witnessed the incident.)       
               
**Additionally, the anti-Trump lawyer [Michael Avenatti](https://twitter.com/MichaelAvenatti/status/1044006928416825344) claims to have a female client with “credible information regarding Judge Kavanaugh,”** who is prepared to come forward, but has not yet done so.       
               
**For now, Ramirez’s story supplements the account of [Dr. Christine Blasey Ford](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/23/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-christine-blasey-ford-testify.html?h_sid=9ec53bd19d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21885&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), who is scheduled to testify to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday** about her claim that Kavanaugh assaulted her when the two were high school students in the early 1980s. Some Senate Democrats want to delay that hearing, so that Ramirez’s allegation can be investigated and she can be invited to testify as well.       
               
**Republicans, by contrast, responded by trying to [rush Kavanaugh on to the Supreme Court](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/senate-democrats-investigate-a-new-allegation-of-sexual-misconduct-from-the-supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaughs-college-years-deborah-ramirez?h_sid=9ec53bd19d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21885&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive).** “Senior Republican staffers also learned of the allegation last week and, in conversations with The *New Yorker*, expressed concern about its potential impact on Kavanaugh’s nomination,” write Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer. “Soon after, Senate Republicans issued renewed calls to accelerate the timing of a committee vote.” Some heroes don’t wear capes.       
               
**They also intensified their attacks on the accusers’ credibility. In a [letter to the chairman and ranking member](https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/1044283190146486282) of the Judiciary Committee,** Kavanaugh described the allegations as a “coordinated effort to destroy my good name.” He will also appear on Fox News on Monday evening—his first public appearance since the first accusation surfaced.       
               
**In angry floor remarks, Senate Majority Leader [Mitch McConnell](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/mcconnell-slams-shameful-smear-campaign-against-kavanaugh/2018/09/24/f739f09a-c02f-11e8-9f4f-a1b7af255aa5_video.html?h_sid=9ec53bd19d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.e91e7765ba03&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21885&amp;noredirect=on)** said the stories were part of a “shameful smear campaign.”       
               
**From Brian:** Republicans want Kavanaugh supporters to interpret their defiance as a sign of strength and resolve, but it is actually a sign of panic. It is extremely unusual for Supreme Court nominees to wage media campaigns on their own behalf, and doing it on Fox News suggests he’s worried about his level of support in the Republican base. On Sunday, Team Kavanaugh claimed to have unearthed a calendar he supposedly kept the summer he allegedly assaulted Ford, as if the fact that he didn’t log drinking and sexual assault incidents somehow vindicates him. That’s also a desperate move. On Friday, McConnell predicted “Judge Kavanaugh” would become “Justice Kavanaugh.” Today, he would only say Kavanaugh “will be voted on here on the Senate floor—up or down.” His position is slipping.

Rosenstein has disputed this story, and reportedly will not step down unless Trump fires him.

Israel has previously asked Russia to refrain from providing Syria with these weapons, but a Russian investigation concluded that Israel was responsible for the attack on its plane because Israel was the intended target. From Tommy: The S-300 system is a highly advanced, lethal anti-aircraft missile system that will significantly increase the risk of flying Israeli or US planes over Syria. It’s also a big "screw you" from Putin to Netanyahu.

**Kavanaugh's Credibility Crisis**

**Senate Republicans remain committed to rushing Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination, regardless of the damaging allegations of sexual misconduct** that have arisen against him.

**Meanwhile, the fact that Kavanaugh isn’t a trustworthy person is breaking through in new ways,** thanks in large part to his decision to defend himself from sexual assault accusations by depicting himself as a choirboy.       
               
**In an [extraordinarily unusual interview](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/24/brett-kavanaughs-fox-news-interview-transcript-annotated/?h_sid=dbd18fe1f4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.1917c12c06fc&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21932&amp;noredirect=on) with Fox News on Monday night, Kavanaugh made the following claims:**       
               
1. He was a virgin throughout and for “many years after” high school.        
               
2. He never drank to such excess that he blacked out.        
               
3. Not only did he never participate in any sexually abusive behavior, he “never saw or heard of any such thing.”       
               
**These statements were quickly refuted by witnesses:**       
               
1. One of Kavanaugh’s classmates, award-winning historian Steve Kantrowitz, [recalls](https://twitter.com/skantrow/status/1044596637950251008) Kavanaugh claiming to be sexually active freshman year.        
               
2. Kavanaugh’s freshman-year roommate [told the *New Yorker*](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/senate-democrats-investigate-a-new-allegation-of-sexual-misconduct-from-the-supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaughs-college-years-deborah-ramirez?h_sid=dbd18fe1f4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21932&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) that Kavanaugh was “frequently, incoherently drunk,” and has since [elaborated on the point](https://twitter.com/PeterKauffmann/status/1044384650767020033).        
               
3. Since Dr. Ford came forward with her story of assault, [numerous alumni](https://www.thecut.com/2018/09/christine-blasey-ford-holton-arms-alumnae-letter-of-support.html?h_sid=dbd18fe1f4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21932&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) from her school and similar DC private schools have come forward to say stories like the one Ford has told were commonplace, and everyone was familiar with them.       
               
**The [*New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/24/business/brett-kavanaugh-yearbook-renate.html?h_sid=dbd18fe1f4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21932&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) also published an article detailing how Kavanaugh and his friends** used their yearbook to peddle coded rumors about having had sexual relations with a specific girl at a nearby high school. In the [yearbook](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/brett-kavanaugh-allegations-yearbook-male-bonding.html?h_sid=dbd18fe1f4-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21932&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), Kavanaugh referred to himself as an “alumnius [sic]” of this woman.       
               
**But he responded to the *Times* with the insulting claim that he was merely alluding to attending “one high school event together,”** and sharing “a brief kiss good night” afterward. Hilariously, the woman told the *Times* that even this is untrue. “I think Brett must have me confused with someone else, because I never kissed him,” she said.       
               
**His credibility problems are turning into credibility problems with Republicans.** [Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK)](https://twitter.com/alexburnsNYT/status/1044624507804291073) says the debate is no longer about “whether or not Judge Kavanaugh is qualified. It is about whether or not a woman who has been a victim at some point in her life is to be believed.”

And that’s just one of the incriminating developments that surfaced Wednesday.       
               
**The woman, Julie Swetnick, is a client of the anti-Trump lawyer Michael Avenatti, who [tweeted a sworn affidavit](https://twitter.com/MichaelAvenatti/status/1044960428730843136)** in which Swetnick alleges that Kavanaugh and his friends would spike punch at house parties in order to make girls lose their inhibitions, or become incapacitated enough to be gang raped. She says she became the victim of one of these rapes about 36 years ago, and that she shared her story with at least two other people shortly after the incident. She does not specifically claim that Kavanaugh raped her or anyone else.        
               
**Swetnick has not spoken publicly about the claims in the affidavit, but [news outlets](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/who-is-julie-swetnick-the-third-kavanaugh-accuser/2018/09/26/91e16ed8-c1bc-11e8-97a5-ab1e46bb3bc7_story.html?h_sid=b02d8e29b2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.8ab916a18192&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21980&amp;noredirect=on) have been able to confirm several biographical details** she and Avenatti have put forth about her. She is a graduate of Gaithersburg High School in Maryland, as she attests in her affidavit, and is a “web and information technology expert with an extensive history of contracting with the federal government [who has] worked on projects as a contractor or subcontractor for the U.S. Mint, the IRS and Customs and Border Protection,” [according to NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/woman-alleges-kavanaugh-spiked-punch-parties-so-intoxicated-girls-could-n912491?h_sid=b02d8e29b2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21980&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive). Her [resume](https://www.postjobfree.com/resume/ac0h66/analytics-content-web-app-washington-dc?h_sid=b02d8e29b2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21980&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) also indicates Swetnick has held security clearances, as Avenatti has claimed.

- **Judge’s ex-girlfriend has [offered to speak to the FBI](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2018/09/26/mark-judges-girlfriend-is-ready-to-talk-to-fbi-and-judiciary-committee-her-lawyer-says/?h_sid=b02d8e29b2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21980&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) about her claim, first reported in the *New Yorker*,** that Judge once confessed to taking turns with other boys having sex with a drunk woman.

And yet, in an otherwise gross and rambling New York City press conference Wednesday night, Trump essentially said he [might still pull Kavanaugh’s nomination](https://www.ajc.com/news/national/brett-kavanaugh-nomination-trump-accuses-democrats-playing-con-game/83ANGScuPiaVnIHPYYVhgJ/?h_sid=b02d8e29b2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21980&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) if his accusers are credible.        
               
**From Brian:** The fact that Kavanaugh has not withdrawn, that tomorrow’s hearing has not been postponed, that it will proceed under the contrived terms Republicans set for it, and that neither Senate Republicans, nor the White House, nor Kavanaugh himself will call upon the FBI to reopen its background check to investigate these allegations, is disgusting. It’s also a reminder that Republicans are who they showed us they were during the 2016 elections. Thankfully they’re providing the reminder just a few weeks before their congressional majorities are up for grabs. → [votesaveamerica.com](https://votesaveamerica.com/verify/?h_sid=b02d8e29b2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21980&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive)       
               
**I Cannot *NOT* Tell A Lie**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump spent almost an hour and a half [rambling like a madman at a press conference](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-news-conference-un-kavanaugh-2018/index.html?h_sid=b02d8e29b2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_21980&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) today.** Here are some highlights:       
               
- He called the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh “all false to me” and a “big fat con job” by Democrats, but says he will be be watching the testimony of Dr. Ford tomorrow, and “can always be convinced.” However, he also said the allegations “affect him” because he himself has “had many false charges” made against him, and he repeatedly asserted his support for Kavanaugh.       
               
- He indicated that his “preference would be to keep” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in his job, and said that he may delay the meeting he has scheduled with Rosenstein Thursday in order to avoid “competing” with the Kavanaugh hearing.        
               
- He said "women are so angry” about what he calls a Kavanaugh smear campaign. Trump’s right—women are angry—but not because of a ‘smear campaign.’ In the past week, support for Trump and Kavanaugh has taken a nosedive among Republican women, with their [approval ratings](https://twitter.com/eyokley/status/1045010444791029761) falling 19 and 18 points, respectively.       
               
**Other soundbites you no longer need to go looking for:** Trump called a Kurdish reporter “[Mr. Kurd](https://twitter.com/sppeoples/status/1045068069213810689),” insinuated [George Washington](https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1045069534158368771) had “accusations...in his past,” quoted [Elton John](https://twitter.com/SteveKopack/status/1045074702824345600), and had a very [uncomfortable exchange](https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1045058912360288272) about taking questions from women reporters.

**[Rep.

**Remember when Bob Woodward revealed that President Trump’s former economic adviser Gary Cohn removed documents from Trump’s desk** so Trump wouldn’t sign them?

Probably because he knows firsthand that Trump needs a babysitter.          
               
**The [Texas Attorney General](https://www.theroot.com/texas-attorney-general-stands-with-school-that-expelled-1829319578?h_sid=b02d8e29b2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=2018-09-26&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=theroot_newsletter) has weighed in on the side of a Texas public school** that expelled a teenager who refused to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance.

- [Sen. John Kennedy](https://twitter.com/KristenhCNN/status/1045027680087932933) (R-LA) said the attorney Republicans have hired to question Dr. Christine Blasey Ford tomorrow should not “go cat woman on anybody.”         
               
- [Sen. Lindsey Graham](https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/1044998476277444609) (R-SC) said, “I have a difficult time believing any person would continue to go to—according to the affidavit—ten parties over a two-year period where women were routinely gang raped and not report it.”

They got what they wanted, but not in the way they expected.

Kavanaugh, by contrast, melted down in the angriest and most partisan performance a Supreme Court nominee has ever delivered before the committee.       
               
**Ford fielded questions from committee Democrats and Rachel Mitchell, a prosecutor committee Republicans hired to ask their questions,** in alternating, five-minute increments. She maintained that she is “[100 percent certain](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/in-emotional-testimony-ford-says-she-is-100-percent-certain-that-kavanaugh-assaulted-her/2018/09/27/774fb8ea-c26b-11e8-b338-a3289f6cb742_story.html?h_sid=a0ea4e0a2e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22021&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;noredirect=on)” that Kavanaugh assaulted her.       
               
**Ford’s testimony combined with her professional expertise as a PhD holder in psychology,** makes her a uniquely credible witness. It also underscored the disparity between her credibility and the lack of seriousness with which Republicans have taken her accusations:        
               
- **Ford [reiterated her recollection](https://twitter.com/NBCPolitics/status/1045332982708535298) that she “believed [Kavanaugh] was going to rape me.** I believed Brett was going to accidentally kill me,” adding that her memory of the incident, including “uproarious laughter between [her attackers] and their having fun at my expense,” is “indelible in the hippocampus.”        
               
- **Her [certainty that Kavanaugh assaulted her](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/09/christine-blasey-ford-hearing-kavanaugh-traumatic-memories-brain-psychology.html?h_sid=a0ea4e0a2e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22021&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) stems, she said, both from,“basic memory functions** and also just the level of norepinephrine and the epinephrine in the brain that as you know encodes that neurotransmitter that codes memories into the hippocampus and so the trauma-related experience is locked there, whereas other details kind of drift.”       
               
- **She revealed that she had [requested](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/national/wp/2018/09/27/kavanaugh-hearing-transcript/?h_sid=a0ea4e0a2e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.014bc0b00768&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22021) her charge against Kavanaugh be vetted** *before* President Trump nominated Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, in the hope that he would not ultimately be selected.        
               
- **She testified to encountering a nervous [Mark Judge](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brett-kavanaugh-safeway-christine-blasey-ford-mark-judge_us_5bacfa27e4b09d41eb9f0a0d?h_sid=a0ea4e0a2e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22021&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), Kavanaugh’s alleged accomplice, at the Safeway where he worked, six to eight weeks after the assault.** More importantly, she framed the encounter as an important lead for investigators that would allow them to narrow down the timeframe of the incident to a two week window. Ford has requested that Judge and others with knowledge of the incident be called to testify. The Judiciary Committee denied her request.        
               
**Her testimony left Republicans with few openings to impeach her credibility.** Mitchell repeatedly asked Ford about her [fear of flying](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/far-right-twitter-mocks-christine-ford-crying-memory?h_sid=a0ea4e0a2e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22021&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive), about how she found [her lawyers](https://twitter.com/mikiebarb/status/1045371808789270528), and who paid for her polygraph.

**It is impossible to overstate the contrast between Dr. Ford’s testimony and [Brett Kavanaugh’s](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/27/politics/brett-kavanaugh-hearing/index.html?h_sid=a0ea4e0a2e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22021&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive).**       
               
- **He [denied Dr. Ford’s allegation](https://twitter.com/aabramson/status/1045394848101146624):** “I’ve never sexually assaulted Dr. Ford or anyone.”       
               
- **He [denied the other allegations](https://twitter.com/ABCPolitics/status/1045404794351833088) that have been made against him,** calling them “a joke,” and “a farce."       
               
- **He waged partisan attacks on his accusers and committee Democrats,** depicting them as “coordinated” elements of “the left” and “that side of the aisle” who are "fueled by pent-up anger over President Trump in the 2016 election” and seeking “revenge on behalf of the Clintons.”         
               
- **When asked to request that the FBI reopen his background investigation,** to clear his name, [he froze and refused to respond](https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1045414027990634498). This was the most revealing moment of his testimony. Kavanaugh is terrified at the thought of Mark Judge testifying or submitting for an interview with investigators.       
               
- **He repeatedly raised his voice and attempted to turn questions from Democratic senators**—including [Sens. Amy Klobuchar](https://twitter.com/merica/status/1045419908446785536) (D-MN), [Sheldon Whitehouse](https://twitter.com/justinbaragona/status/1045416373093113859) (D-RI), [Patrick Leahy](https://twitter.com/burgessev/status/1045410838889271297) (D-VT)—around on them.  
 
**Throughout the hearing multiple Republican senators had effectively tried to browbeat their undecided colleagues into confirming Kavanaugh.** By the end of it, [Sen. Jeff Flake](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kavanaugh-ford-testify-senate-judiciary-committee-live-updates/story?h_sid=a0ea4e0a2e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22021&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;id=58107237&amp;utm_source=hive) (R-AZ) acknowledged he still had doubts.

**From Brian:** Kavanaugh sees this ending one of two ways—with his confirmation to the Supreme Court, or with his martyrdom. In truth, he should lose his current seat on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals over this performance. He can’t credibly serve as a judge anywhere, both because of the accusations he is scared to see properly investigated, and because he lowered the mask, revealing his basic nature as a vicious partisan. But whatever happens, the Kavanaugh debacle will loom large in political life for years. If he is confirmed to the Court, Democrats have pledged to pursue the allegations seriously when they next control Congress. If he withdraws, or his confirmation vote fails, Republicans will wage war. [Sen. Lindsey Graham](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/27/17910750/lindsey-graham-christine-blasey-ford-hearing-brett-kavanaugh?h_sid=a0ea4e0a2e-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22021&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) (R-SC) even warned that Republicans will gin up false accusations against future Democratic nominees to settle this score.

- [Sen. Orrin Hatch](https://twitter.com/kateirby/status/1045354070658232320) (R-UT) called Ford “an attractive witness.” When asked to clarify, he said “she’s pleasing.”

**Brett Kavanaugh will not be confirmed to the Supreme Court until the [FBI completes a White House-ordered background investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-senate-judiciary.html?h_sid=a74e88cfc5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22071&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive)** of at least one sexual assault allegation—an investigation Kavanaugh himself has been desperate to avoid—and even then, his fate remains in doubt.       
               
**Republicans *appeared* poised to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination, and confirm him next week on party lines.** But early Friday afternoon [Sen. Jeff Flake](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/28/17915034/jeff-flake-brett-kavanaugh-senate-confirmation-vote?h_sid=a74e88cfc5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22071&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) (R-AZ)—who had already announced his intent to support Kavanaugh—had a change of heart, and declared that his vote on the Senate floor would be contingent upon the FBI investigating [what he called] “the current allegations that are there.”       
               
**“I will only be comfortable moving forward on the floor [if] the FBI has done more investigation than they have already,”** he added.       
               
**[Sen. Lisa Murkowski](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-kavanaugh-murkowski/republican-senator-murkowski-backs-idea-of-delay-in-vote-on-kavanaugh-idUSKCN1M82JI?h_sid=a74e88cfc5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22071&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) (R-AK) quickly backed Flake’s position, which put them in the driver’s seat:** Without their commitments, Kavanaugh lacked the votes he needed to be confirmed, which meant their demands had to be met, [and they quickly were](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-judiciary-committee-postpones-kavanaugh-decision-friday-afternoon-n914676?h_sid=a74e88cfc5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22071&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive).       
               
**Now, for Kavanaugh to be confirmed, the following things must happen:**       
               
- Kavanaugh must choose not to withdraw his nomination.       
               
- The background check must not return any red flags.       
               
- Fifty senators must be willing to vote for Kavanaugh at the end of the process.       
               
**Kavanaugh could survive all of this.** Most Republicans seem desperate to place him on the Supreme Court, notwithstanding his [unhinged, partisan, dishonest testimony](https://crooked.com/article/brett-kavanaugh-trump-partisan/?h_sid=a74e88cfc5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22071&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) to the Senate. But he faces a tougher climb:       
               
**At Thursday’s hearing, Kavanaugh was [completely reluctant](https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1045419018373525504) to support a background check**—the easiest way to clear his name. A lawyer for Kavanaugh’s alleged accomplice in assaulting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, [Mark Judge](https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1045754564463546368), has already promised to cooperate with the FBI. The FBI could find corroboration for the assault allegations elsewhere, or could grill Kavanaugh about the allegations, and various smaller lies, and find his responses not credible. By the time the background check is done, polling could find Kavanaugh has become even more politically toxic than he already is, and senators could decide to oppose him for other reasons.       
               
**From Brian:** The smart thing for Kavanaugh opponents to do now is spend a week driving home the fact that Kavanaugh lied promiscuously to the Senate about a wide range of issues, big and small, not just about Ford. A proper FBI investigation should not be limited to what happened between Kavanaugh and Ford in 1982, but about other assault allegations and a number of false statements Kavanaugh made in the course of denying all wrongdoing. The FBI should nail down the question of whether Kavanaugh ever blacked out from excessive drinking. Ridiculous as it sounds, the FBI should get to the bottom of what Kavanaugh [meant in his yearbook](https://www.vox.com/2018/9/26/17901368/kavanaugh-yearbook-boof-devil-triangle-renate-beach-week?h_sid=a74e88cfc5-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=hive_email_id_22071&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=hive) by “boofed,” “devil’s triangle,” and “Renate alumnius,” and present the truth about those terms to the Senate. If Republicans intend to confirm Kavanaugh no matter what, they should have to do so not just in the face of doubt about the assault allegations, but in the face of proof that Kavanaugh lied under oath.

**“What you are doing is allowing someone who actually violated a woman to sit on the Supreme Court,” said Archila.** “This is not tolerable. You have children in your family. Think about them.”       
               
**“You’re telling all women that they don’t matter,” continued Gallagher.** “Look at me and tell me that it doesn’t matter what happened to me.”        
               
**They—as much as or more than the Democratic senators who pleaded with Flake to change his mind**—deserve enormous praise for forcing a pause in the Kavanaugh confirmation process, and possibly for changing history.

Not that I've ever dropped acid. But... for a record, I have not."—[Sen.

**Do As I Tweet, Not As I Do**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump has a problem: His coalition is made up of ultra-wealthy backers who want tax cuts and deregulation and [his base](https://www.npr.org/2017/12/11/569527547/the-myth-of-trumps-economic-populism-as-proven-by-the-tax-bill?h_sid=70b04185b1-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) who wants “populism.”** It’s a tough needle to thread! But don’t worry: Trump has a plan. Step 1) Loudly pick fights with billionaires. Step 2) Give them everything they want.                                          
                   
**On Tuesday, Trump [pretended to start a feud](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1024236805477097472) with billionaire GOP donors Charles and David Koch.** He called the brothers “globalist[s]” who oppose “Strong Borders and Powerful Trade” but “love my Tax &amp; Regulation Cuts, Judicial picks &amp; more.”                           
          
**But on Monday, Trump’s Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told reporters that he is considering an administrative [change to the tax code that would give $100 billion away](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/us/politics/trump-tax-cuts-rich.html?h_sid=70b04185b1-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) to ultra-rich people** like the Kochs. Under this scheme, rich people would pay substantially lower capital gains taxes, because they’d be allowed to adjust the purchase prices of their assets upward to account for inflation. Previous Republican administrations have considered this idea, and concluded that it would be unlawful.                                      
          
**From Brian:** Here’s the Republican Party in a nutshell. President Trump and the Kochs pretend to feud, while simultaneously teaming up to loot the country, and install as many Republicans as possible in all branches of government. The Koch network will make just enough low-decibel noise about Trump’s unpopular immigration and trade policies to give Trump cover to pretend he’s bucking “globalists.” Trump plays a similar game with pharmaceutical companies, who have benefited enormously from Trump’s corporate tax cuts, and can thus brush off Trump’s disingenuous complaints about drug prices as part of the cost of doing business. The *Washington Post*’s [Philip Bump](https://twitter.com/pbump/status/1024300487925874688) described it as a “culture-wars-for-the-poor, tax-cuts-for-the-rich approach to politics.” Let them eat tweets, I guess.

The company informed lawmakers of its findings in briefings on Capitol Hill this week, and says it is working with the FBI to investigate. The company has not confirmed that Russian agents are running the campaign, though the activity resembles propaganda Russians used to sow discord and help Trump in 2016.

**Trump has [confessed for a third time](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1024347406887014404) that he intends to shut down the government if Congress doesn’t fund a wall along the southern border,** and says he “[doesn’t] care what the political ramifications are.” No kidding.

They've generally stayed out of primaries, and Abdul is not the front runner (as they mentioned), so it's a pretty bold move.

**You Can't Obstruct Justice Online**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Amid a lengthy Wednesday morning outburst, [Trump tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1024646945640525826) “Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now,** before it continues to stain our country any further.”          
                                
**The tweet’s ambiguity—did he intend it as an order?—revived a very fun ongoing debate about whether Trump is obstructing justice out in the open.** It also sent his lawyers and White House aides [scrambling](https://twitter.com/christinawilkie/status/1024749410255814656) to insist he was merely voicing an opinion about what he believes would be best for the country, rather than officially demanding the end of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.                                  
            
**Oh the president? He’s just blowing off steam!**                   
               
**The big question isn’t whether Trump is obstructing justice in public**—he’s been doing that for a long time now! It’s what got Trump so riled up this morning? Why’s he going after Mueller and DOJ again? Some possibilities:                  
                 
- **His former campaign manager, [Paul Manafort](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/01/politics/manafort-trial-day-two/index.html?h_sid=bfb9e0ac9d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), is currently on trial for financial fraud.** Trump, like his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, may be concerned Manafort is going to decide to cooperate with Mueller.              
                   
- **His former lawyer, [Michael Cohen](https://crooked.com/newsletter/what-a-day-cohen-to-prison/?h_sid=bfb9e0ac9d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), is apparently shopping stories to reporters that implicate other Trump associates** in a conspiracy with Russian agents to sabotage Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Trump might worry that Cohen’s telling the same stories to prosecutors. Or perhaps other stories!                
                
- **It could be an inkling his lawyers picked up from Mueller that the grand jury will return more indictments soon,** and that the investigation is closing in on him and his family. Pretty vexing for him.                 
          
**Also, Trump didn’t tweet in a vacuum. All week, Giuliani and other Trump surrogates have been flooding the media with nonsense and distraction,** while awkwardly teeing up the argument that colluding with Russia wouldn’t be illegal or even very bad. Over the past couple months, Trump has been rage-tweeting about Mueller [six or seven times more frequently](https://twitter.com/gelles/status/1022809523499819009) than he had in the months before that.

**Senate Republicans are [trying to confirm](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/national-archives-all-requested-kavanaugh-documents-probably-won-t-be-n896991) President Trump’s [unpopular](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/brett-kavanaugh-is-polling-like-robert-bork-and-harriet-miers/) Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh without allowing the public to fully scrutinize his record in government.** And they might get away with it if Democratic leaders won’t take up the fight.                     
               
**The general counsel of the National Archives has advised Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley** that the archives won’t be able to fully produce Kavanaugh’s correspondence from his years as an associate White House counsel [until the end of October](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/national-archives-says-it-wont-be-able-to-produce-all-kavanaugh-documents-until-end-of-october/2018/08/02/011a9f1e-966f-11e8-8ffb-5de6d5e49ada_story.html?noredirect=on), well after Senate Republicans intended to vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination.                  
                  
**Senators generally insist upon reviewing all public-service documents before even holding a confirmation *hearing***, but [Republicans say](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kavanaugh-confirmation-hearings-not-likely-until-september-senate-judiciary-chairman-says/2018/08/01/66ce9ee2-95a6-11e8-a679-b09212fb69c2_story.html%3Futm_term%3D.98ece6033ddb) they’ll hold Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing in September anyhow.                                
               
**Republicans had already [intentionally excluded all of Kavanaugh’s records](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/02/politics/brett-kavanaugh-documents-republican-not-budging/index.html) from his tenure as President George W. Bush’s White House staff secretary**—one of the most sensitive jobs in every administration—from their document request. Democrats suspect Republicans are [trying to suppress documentation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/republicans-are-obstructing-a-fair-vetting-of-brett-kavanaugh/2018/07/30/9d823d00-9410-11e8-80e1-00e80e1fdf43_story.html%3Futm_term%3D.a662539970d1) of Kavanaugh’s role advancing Bush’s torture policy, among other things.                     
          
**As long as all Republicans are committed to confirming an unvetted Supreme Court justice, they can.** But [Democrats are making it easy for them](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/schumer-plays-long-game-avoids-hardball-with-centrist-democrats-over-supreme-court-pick/2018/07/27/f3fb86dc-90d2-11e8-b769-e3fff17f0689_story.html%3Futm_term%3D.30227a8bd83c?utm_term=.d42a2eebe553) by failing to unify *against* Kavanaugh—at least until his records are provided to the public.                    
             
**If Democrats were aligned, then every single Republican senator (but for John McCain, who is undergoing cancer treatment) would have to go along with the party’s efforts to hide Kavanaugh’s records from the public.** Moderates like [Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME)](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brett-kavanaugh-collins-documents_us_5b60c205e4b0de86f49baa26) would thus feel much more pressure to hold Kavanaugh to the same standard as past Supreme Court justices.                      
          
**But Democrats aren’t fully unified—on Kavanaugh generally or the records issue specifically.** Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer is “always mindful of not only the Democratic caucus position, but the impact it has on individual members,” according to his deputy, [Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/schumer-plays-long-game-avoids-hardball-with-centrist-democrats-over-supreme-court-pick/2018/07/27/f3fb86dc-90d2-11e8-b769-e3fff17f0689_story.html?h_sid=91d5cf6920-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.8255ed8e0b8e). “And of course, the highest priority are those that are up for reelection in tough states.”                          
                
**From Brian:** In other words, Schumer isn’t pressuring conservative Democrats facing re-election this year to line up against Kavanaugh because he fears losing a Senate seat in West Virginia more than he fears losing the Supreme Court for a generation. It’s possible, of course, that if Democrats close ranks, Republicans will press ahead anyhow. But nothing is written. Democrats *could* win the fight to at least delay debate on Kavanaugh’s confirmation. The fact that they’re not trying as hard as possible reflects a failure of leadership.

**Interview with a WAAAAA-mpire**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Donald Trump is not behaving like someone who is not worried** that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation is about to reach him. Let’s call it "publicly moodier than usual."                 
                  
**The ongoing federal criminal trial of Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, is “spinning [Trump] into a frenzy,”** according to [sources who spoke to *Vanity Fair*](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/trumps-new-frenzy-unnerves-his-advisers?h_sid=4e9f20772a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84). Reportedly he is threatening to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in the next couple weeks if Mueller doesn’t conclude his investigation.                             
                
**We’ve known since Wednesday that Trump is, [for *some* reason](https://crooked.com/newsletter/what-a-day-obstructo-patronum/?h_sid=4e9f20772a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), more panicked about the investigation than usual.** That’s when Trump tweeted that Attorney General Jeff Sessions should end the investigation. CNN [dug into that incident](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/01/politics/trump-russia-jeff-sessions-mueller/index.html?h_sid=4e9f20772a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) and learned Trump erupted just hours after his lawyers briefed him on the latest developments in Manafort’s trial and the Mueller investigation more generally. This included an update on ongoing negotiations between Mueller and Trump’s lawyers over whether Trump will agree to an interview with federal prosecutors.                            
            
**Plus, earlier this week, CNN reported that that Trump’s aides are “working to schedule more political rallies,** partly to boost Trump's mood and distract him from the headlines about Russia.” They should also try dangling keys in front of his face.               
           
**From Brian:** Trump’s criminal defense attorney, Rudy Giuliani, has [successfully spun many journalists](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/us/politics/trump-mueller-investigation-interview.html?h_sid=4e9f20772a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) into reporting that Trump is merely impatient and actually *wants* to meet with Mueller, against the advice of his lawyers, to hasten the end of the investigation. This is plainly bullshit. Trump has been avoiding a Mueller interview for months now. He clearly isn’t clamoring to cooperate with an investigation that he is also publicly and privately obstructing and fantasizing about terminating. He seems closer to firing Mueller than cooperating with him.

Shooter Stephen Paddock killed 58 people attending a country music festival, and injured hundreds more, in what remains the largest mass killing in America since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

“The Detroit neighborhood now regularly called Fishkorn (pronounced FISH-korn), but previously known as Fiskhorn (pronounced FISK-horn)? That was because of Google Maps. Midtown South Central in Manhattan? That was also given life by Google Maps.”

**“Fake News reporting, a complete fabrication, that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son, Donald, had in Trump Tower.** This was a meeting to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere. I did not know about it!,” he [tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1026084333315153924).              
                     
**First of all, [it is illegal to accept help from a foreign government in this way](https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari-melber/watch/legal-reporter-ari-melber-fact-check-collusion-is-a-crime-1289556035666?h_sid=1e199ccc0d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;cid=sm_npd_ms_tw_ma), so let’s just get this out of the way:**                                      
           
- It’s a [crime](https://www.fec.gov/updates/foreign-nationals/?h_sid=1e199ccc0d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) for a U.S. presidential campaign to receive or solicit anything of value from any foreign entity.                       
                  
- It’s a [crime](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-russia-investigation.html?h_sid=1e199ccc0d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) to defraud the U.S.                         
             
- It’s a [crime](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/7/31/17634146/trump-collusion-crime-russia-mueller?h_sid=1e199ccc0d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) to conspire to commit the aforementioned crimes.                     
                  
- Also, it should be a crime to think we’re dumb enough to believe it was about adoptions.                        
                
**This also destroys a [year’s worth of lies](https://www.axios.com/trump-tower-meeting-tweet-stories-russia-c5056ecc-c520-47b4-a6ab-0dcf2d9853b7.html?h_sid=1e199ccc0d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) from the Trump camp claiming that this meeting was collusion-free.**               
                  
**When knowledge of the meeting first became public in July of 2017, Trump [dictated a statement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-dictated-sons-misleading-statement-on-meeting-with-russian-lawyer/2017/07/31/04c94f96-73ae-11e7-8f39-eeb7d3a2d304_story.html?h_sid=1e199ccc0d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;noredirect=on) that Don Jr., issued,** which claimed the meeting was held to discuss adoption policy between the U.S. and Russia. Bullshit detectors went off long before the [*New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/us/politics/trump-russia-email-clinton.html?h_sid=1e199ccc0d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) published emails between Trump Jr. and Rob Goldstone, the man who arranged the meeting. The emails were clear: The meeting was held to give the Trump camp politically damaging information on Clinton.                                      
                
**The president’s legal team and the #MAGA media have pivoted to the [“collusion isn’t a crime” defense](https://crooked.com/newsletter/what-a-day-yes-collusion/?h_sid=1e199ccc0d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).** Instead of claiming “no collusion,” as Trump often tweets, they’re painting this as something that’s “totally legal,” and happens “all the time.” Narrator: [It’s not](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/08/collusion-is-a-question-of-loyalty-not-legality/566606/?h_sid=1e199ccc0d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), it doesn’t, and it shouldn’t.

**OMAROSA IS DONE**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Former reality show star, fired senior Trump administration official, and dramatic-pause enthusiast Omarosa Manigault Newman has [secretly recorded White House tapes](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/12/us/politics/omarosa-trump-tape.html?h_sid=8f1598093c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).** As part of her book tour, she is doing interviews embarrassing her former boss and colleagues by publicly releasing those tapes. And the White House—which is and always has been staffed by [totally](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/01/21/sean-spicer-donald-trump-inauguration-crowd-bts.cnn?h_sid=8f1598093c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) [credible](https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/22/politics/kellyanne-conway-alternative-facts/index.html?h_sid=8f1598093c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) [people](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/02/john-kelly-rob-porter/552704/?h_sid=8f1598093c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)—has no idea how to respond.                        
               
**On Monday morning, Omarosa released a recording of a [phone conversation she had with Trump](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/omarosa-manigault-newman-reveals-recording-she-made-president-trump-day-n900066?h_sid=8f1598093c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** in which he (unconvincingly) claimed not to have any idea that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly had decided to fire her. "You know, they run a big operation but I didn't know it. I didn't know that. Damn it, I don't love you leaving at all." (He sounds so weak, it’s great.)                    
        
**Meanwhile, in [audio she released Sunday](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/fb-6052711/LISTEN-Audio-John-Kelly-firing-Omarosa-situation-room-integrity-issues.html?h_sid=8f1598093c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), which she recorded in the White House Situation Room, Kelly suggested she would be “open to some legal action”** if she didn’t accept her firing-for-cause quietly. “I’d like to see this be a a friendly departure,” he said. “There are pretty significant legal issues that we hope don’t develop into something that—that’ll make it ugly for you.”                 
         
**Omarosa also claims to have audio of [Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/13/omarosa-jared-ivanka-tapes-775712?h_sid=8f1598093c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** pleading ignorance about her firing as well. Jared and Ivanka pleading ignorance on literally any matter? It checks out.                     
               
**Trump has responded by calling Omarosa (whom he gave a senior White House job) a “[low life](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/12/politics/omarosa-manigault-newman-john-kelly/index.html?h_sid=8f1598093c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).”** But neither he nor any of his surrogates can lie and deny in their normal brazen fashion because Omarosa’s iPhone has the Voice Memos app and she knows how to use it.       
                 
**From Brian:** Every character in this story is terrible and untrustworthy, but that’s why the tapes matter, and why it’s significant that White House is so rattled about what’s coming next. Omarosa kept her receipts, which makes it harder for Trump to attack her credibility. If she’s lying, they can deny her claims and call her bluff. But if she’s telling the truth, they will give it away by not denying it, and attacking her personally, because they can’t know whether she has tapes.                    
        
**Love her or hate her, at least Omarosa is saying how bad things are on the record.** That’s better than the cowardly background quotes from so-called moderates like Gary Cohn, Dina Powell, Rex Tillerson, and Reince Priebus who just defend themselves to reporters off the record.

**The neo-Nazis scheduled their rally on the anniversary of last year’s Charlottesville, VA marches,** during which one of them murdered counter-protester Heather Heyer.

**“Racism is a very pernicious weed, and it’s roots are deep and largely invisible,”** Stanton wrote. “Knuckle dragging racism out in the open is only a symptom. And as I think we’re hopefully learning, we can’t let that distract us from addressing the bigger virus.”

**Did You See That Thing?**

**Lots of things to see here.**              
             
**First, Stephen Miller got [owned in *Politico* by his uncle](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/08/13/stephen-miller-is-an-immigration-hypocrite-i-know-because-im-his-uncle-219351?h_sid=8f1598093c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), who wrote about Miller’s family of immigrants:** “I have watched with dismay and increasing horror as my nephew, who is an educated man and well aware of his heritage, has become the architect of immigration policies that repudiate the very foundation of our family’s life in this country.” From Brian: It’s pretty remarkable for a family member to level such harsh criticism at a White House adviser like this, but the essay is poignant and heartbreaking on its own terms, and you should all read it.                       
         
**Then, [Kellyanne Conway](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/kellyanne-conway-senior-black-trump-aide-omarosa?h_sid=8f1598093c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) got utterly stumped on live television when asked to name the most senior black aide in the White House** now that Omarosa doesn’t work there anymore.                      
         
**THEN, an 11-year-old girl [changed the results of an election](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/an-11-year-old-changed-election-results-on-a-replica-florida-state-website-in-under-10-minutes?h_sid=8f1598093c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_campaign=newshour&amp;utm_medium=pbsofficial&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;linkId=100000003230945) on a replica state-election website in under 10 minutes** at a hacking convention.

**"Dog" Whistle**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**On Tuesday we learned that President Trump may have at some point been recorded using the n-word, on the set of *The Apprentice* or elsewhere.** White House Press Secretary [Sarah Huckabee Sanders](https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/1029447299678785536) was asked during her press briefing whether she could guarantee that America would never hear the president saying the word on tape, and said that she “can’t guarantee anything,” which is not what you say when you’re confident that your boss doesn’t use racial slurs.     
                            
**On Monday night, Trump [claimed *Apprentice* producer Mark Burnett had called](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1029183344397955074)** to assure him “there are NO TAPES of the Apprentice where I used such a terrible and disgusting word.” Again, if Trump were confident that he never uttered that word, he wouldn’t need Burnett to assure him that he wasn’t recorded saying it.             
            
**Speculation that such a tape might exist [first began in 2016](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/08/trump-n-word-tape-omarosa-guide.html?h_sid=43a6a2cdc2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), but returned this week thanks to Omarosa Manigault Newman,** the book-promoting former White House aide, who claims to believe such a tape exists, and, on Tuesday, [released secretly-recorded audio](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-audio-omarosa-trump-campaign-aides-apparently-discussing-fallout-of-n-word/?h_sid=43a6a2cdc2-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) of Trump campaign advisers admitting Trump used the word, and strategizing about how to spin it if a tape of it surfaced.           
           
**Omarosa isn’t any more credible than Sanders or Trump, but they’re all basically saying the same thing,** and there are plenty of other people who have credibly claimed to have heard Trump using the word. We know the truth, we just don’t know if we’ll ever hear it with our own ears.

This may have been what prompted our (racist) president to refer to her as a “[dog](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1029329583672307712),” which isn’t helping his claims that he hasn’t used racial slurs.

Now the state Senate will decide whether to remove them. However, this comes after the August 14 deadline for arranging a special election that the minority Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee tried to beat. Now, the GOP Gov. Jim Justice will be able to appoint justices to replace any who are impeached, instead of allowing voters to decide in nonpartisan elections.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has refused to raise interest rates to combat the crisis, or to seek outside help, blaming the dive on “an operation against Turkey” instead.

**Classless Classification**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The White House is desperately trying to distract public attention from the feeding frenzy over charges in former White House aide [Omarosa Manigault Newman’s book](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/omarosa-claims-new-book-trump-racist-used-n-word-n899581?h_sid=d2e22de393-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)**—that President Trump is in mental decline and was caught on tape using a racial slur—by authorizing a crackdown on his critics.                     
           
**On Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced that Trump had made good on his July threat to strip [former CIA Director John Brennan](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/us/politics/john-brennan-security-clearance.html?h_sid=d2e22de393-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)—a vocal Trump critic—of his security clearance,** [claiming concern](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/15/17693606/trump-john-brennan-security-clearance?h_sid=d2e22de393-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) over Brennan’s "lying and…. increasingly frenzied commentary.” Because irony is dead.                    
         
**Sanders added he might seek retribution against [more former and current national security officials](https://twitter.com/PhilipRucker/status/1029799693285515265)**—all of whom have played roles in the Russia investigation—in the coming days as well. Former top intelligence officials like Brennan typically keep their clearances so that current officials can seek their counsel on classified matters, so Trump’s national security team—which [wasn’t consulted](https://twitter.com/jimsciutto/status/1029805085856071680) before Trump’s announcement—now can't get advice from some of the country's most experienced intelligence experts. Great.    
                     
**Trump is desperate to silence critics, and discredit potential witnesses in the Russia investigation.** But we know he timed this announcement to distract from the *current* news cycle because the official statement the White House released today announcing the Brennan decision was [dated July 26, 2018](https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1029815133235830790). After reporters noticed Trump had been sitting on this announcement for weeks, the White House [reissued the statement](https://twitter.com/kaitlancollins/status/1029818064290947072) with the date removed. What a [savvy](https://twitter.com/passantino/status/1029840995444174848) communications staff.                
            
**From Brian:** Lies and intimidation are bad enough on their own terms, but we may be witnessing the beginning of a dangerous downward spiral. Trump wants to push Omarosa out of the headlines, and for at least a few hours he has succeeded. But she claims to have more tapes, containing more damaging revelations about Trump and his advisers. Brinkmanship between her and Trump could get very ugly, but she’s trying to hurt Trump, and Trump is responding by hurting the country.             
                
**The Results Are In**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Voters in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Vermont, and Connecticut cast ballots in state primaries on Tuesday. Here’s what happened:**                       
               
**In [Wisconsin](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/8/14/17686086/wisconsin-primary-election-2018-live-results-vukmir-nicholson-evers?h_sid=d2e22de393-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84):** Vulnerable incumbent Republican Scott Walker will face Democrat Tony Evers in November. Meanwhile, incumbent Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin will defend her seat from State Senator Leah Vukmir, though early polling shows Baldwin 10-plus points ahead of Vukmir. One familiar face (Paul Ryan) was notably absent from the ballot, and he was not missed. (Bye Paul!) In his district, Democrat Randy Bryce (“Iron Stache”) will face Bryan Stell, a local executive whom Ryan has endorsed. Stell secured the nomination with 51 percent of the vote, but white supremacist [Paul Nehlen](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-nehlen-white-supremacist-loses-wisconsin-congressional-primary_us_5b6ded0ee4b0530743c9dbf9?h_sid=d2e22de393-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) was somehow able to walk away with 11 percent.                 
             
**In [Minnesota](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/8/14/17686376/minnesota-primary-elections-2018-live-results-keith-ellison?h_sid=d2e22de393-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84):** Tina Smith, who has been serving as an interim senator since Al Franken stepped down, was nominated to serve out the remainder of Franken’s term.

Meanwhile, Democrat Tim Walz and Republican Jeff Johnson will face off to replace retiring Democratic Governor Mark Dayton in a race *Cook Political Report* is calling a toss-up. Johnson defeated former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty by nine points, in a race that was decided in large part by who could be the bigger Trump sycophant. Johnson even attacked Pawlenty for being too critical of Trump after the “grab ‘em by the pussy” tape came out. Ladies and gentlemen, The ~~Aristocrats~~ GOP.

If she wins, she will become the first openly transgender governor in the United States. *Cook* currently classifies the race as solid Republican, though Scott’s popularity has taken a dive in the last year.                  
          
**In [Connecticut](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/8/14/17688146/primary-elections-2018-live-results-wisconsin-minnesota-connecticut-vermont?h_sid=d2e22de393-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84):** Democrats are hoping that Ned Lamont (the same Ned Lamont who challenged Joe Lieberman in 2006) will be able to keep the open governor’s seat blue, though outgoing Democratic Governor Dannel Malloy’s unpopularity has contributed to the race’s classification as a toss-up. Lamont will face Republican Bob Stefanowksi.

**Threat Kavanaugh**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed unless all Senate Democrats unite against him,** which would turn moderate and vulnerable Republican senators like Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) into the deciding votes. So far, Democrats are failing that test abysmally, and there’s no excuse for it.        
            
**After meeting with Kavanaugh on Wednesday, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) [said](https://www.heitkamp.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2018/8/heitkamp-statement-following-meeting-with-u-s-supreme-court-nominee-judge-brett-kavanaugh?h_sid=714aeac233-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** she “will closely study his answers at his Senate hearing [and] continue reviewing his record,” before making a decision about whether she will support his confirmation. When asked for comment, Lovett said “barf.”            
                    
**Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-IN), who also met with Kavanaugh yesterday, [said](https://www.donnelly.senate.gov/newsroom/press/donnelly-meets-with-supreme-court-nominee-judge-brett-kavanaugh?h_sid=714aeac233-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)** he will “make a decision sometime after Kavanaugh’s committee confirmation hearing,” touting the importance of a conducting a “comprehensive review.” There’s a good chance his comprehensive review includes counting the number of phone calls and office visits he receives, so maybe we can all [get on that](https://savescotus.org/?h_sid=714aeac233-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) →                            
              
**Here’s the thing, and it’s not a secret: Republicans are making it impossible for Heitkamp, Donnelly, et al to conduct a “comprehensive review” of Kavanaugh’s “record,”** because [they are refusing](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/16/politics/brett-kavanaugh-documents-democrats-sue/index.html?h_sid=714aeac233-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) to make the vast majority of Kavanaugh’s government records available for senators to review, and are slow walking many others, which will remain undisclosed when confirmation hearings begin in early September.                           
                 
**Brian Fallon, whose group, [Demand Justice](https://demandjustice.org/?h_sid=714aeac233-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), is coordinating Kavanaugh-opposition efforts,** whittled the case these vulnerable Democrats could make against Kavanaugh down [to a single tweet](https://twitter.com/brianefallon/status/1029958793755549697): "I've been open to supporting Judge Kavanaugh but until we see all the records from his time in government, as is the norm for these lifetime appointments, I am unable to conduct the thorough review my constituents expect."                   
                    
**From Brian:** Activist [Ady Barkan](https://theintercept.com/2018/08/16/brett-kavanaugh-susan-collins-ady-barkan/?h_sid=714aeac233-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) is leading an effort to raise money for Susan Collins’ 2020 opponent, but promises to refund that money to donors if Collins votes against Kavanaugh. Democrats who remain on the fence about this nominee are doing Barkan and other activists a disservice by making Collins decision less pivotal. There are [plenty of reasons](https://crooked.com/article/trump-supreme-court-despair/?h_sid=714aeac233-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) to oppose Kavanaugh’s confirmation outright, but those facing tough reelections don’t even have to take a stand based on Kavanaugh’s qualifications. They are being prevented from exercising their advice and consent responsibility, and that should be enough.

In response, [Lara Trump](https://twitter.com/CarolLeonnig/status/1030154158605828096) released a statement that sounds straight out of a *Bachelor* confessional: “I shared a connection with Omarosa as a friend and a campaign sister, and I am absolutely shocked and saddened by her betrayal and violation on a deeply personal level. I hope it’s all worth it for you, Omarosa, because some things you just can’t put a price on.”

**1. Register to vote,** check if you’re actually registered, and keep track of registration deadlines.           
         
**2. Find your polling location, and sign up for reminders** to make sure you don't miss key dates, including, you know, November 6.                       
              
**3. Fill out your ballot.** This is probably the coolest part—our voter guide explains who's running and what’s on each ballot so you know what’s what before you walk into the voting booth. No surprises...

**Multiplayer Co-op**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The Justice Department’s Russia investigation, and the related investigation of whether President Trump and his advisers obstructed justice,** seems to have Trump aides scrambling to protect themselves from Special Counsel Robert Mueller. One official who appears to have taken advantage of the opportunity is White House Counsel Don McGahn.                    
           
**The *New York Times* reported this weekend that [McGahn](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/18/us/politics/don-mcgahn-mueller-investigation.html?h_sid=becbba75f7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) has spent more than 30 hours interviewing with Mueller’s investigators,** and has submitted to at least one interview that had never been publicly disclosed.              
                    
**More importantly, McGahn appears to have been motivated by mistrust of Trump and concern that he could become a target of the investigation himself** if he didn’t play nice with federal prosecutors.                
           
**McGahn and his lawyer reportedly decided that he had little choice but to answer all of Mueller’s questions** when they realized Trump was angling to blame McGahn for actions that comprise the case for obstruction of justice, like the decision to fire FBI Director James Comey.               
           
**But McGahn’s knowledge and exposure extend beyond the obstruction investigation. He is a campaign-finance lawyer by trade,** and as counsel to the Trump campaign, might have knowledge about and even be implicated in the conspiracy with Russia to subvert the election. And, importantly, [Trump’s lawyers](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/19/us/politics/don-mcgahn-trump-mueller.html?h_sid=becbba75f7-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) apparently have no idea what McGahn has told Mueller. (Well, except for McGahn. He knows. Must be a weird week at work!)                          
              
**From Brian:** The *Times* article draws an explicit comparison between McGahn and John Dean, the Nixon White House counsel. Dean became a key witness against his former boss, but only after he played a key role in the Watergate conspiracy, and thus ended up spending time in federal prison. McGahn is apparently intent on avoiding that trajectory. The elephant in the room is that the whole drama is premised on awareness (on both McGahn’s part and Trump’s) that people are likely to be indicted, and the White House has descended into infighting over who is going to take the fall. That’s where we are in this story.

**High Crimes and More High Crimes**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The Justice Department has now rooted criminals out of the upper ranks of every part of Donald Trump’s empire**—his private business, his presidential campaign, and his White House. And that’s just today!        
             
**On Tuesday alone:**           
       
**A jury found Trump’s former campaign chairman [Paul Manafort guilty](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/21/politics/paul-manafort-trial-jury/index.html?h_sid=e2dd17d60a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) of eight of the 18 federal criminal charges he faced** in the Eastern District of Virginia (Manafort will contest several other charges in a DC federal court later this year). The convictions include five counts of tax fraud, one count of hiding foreign bank accounts, and two counts of bank fraud.            
               
**Judge T.S. Ellis declared a [mistrial on the 10 remaining counts](https://twitter.com/ShimonPro/status/1032003098133389314),** and it’s unclear as yet whether Manafort will appeal the convictions or whether the Justice Department will retry the other charges. But the jury reached this verdict despite Trump’s best efforts to influence jurors by praising Manafort and attacking his prosecutors in tweets and on camera repeatedly over the past several weeks.                  
         
**In New York, Trump’s former personal lawyer [Michael Cohen pleaded guilty](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/nyregion/michael-cohen-plea-deal-trump.html?h_sid=e2dd17d60a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) to five counts of tax evasion over five years, one count of bank fraud, and two campaign finance law violations stemming from the 2016 election.** One of those [violations](https://twitter.com/yashar/status/1032007263882424320) concerns an excessive campaign contribution on October 27, 2016, which is the date he paid $130,000 in hush-money to Trump’s former mistress/porn star Stormy Daniels. At his plea hearing, Cohen confessed to illegally arranging payments to Daniels and former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal “in coordination with and at the direction of a federal candidate for office” for the purposes of influencing the election.               
                   
**From [Dan Pfeiffer](https://twitter.com/danpfeiffer/status/1032011922051194880):** “Amidst all the noise, the pleas, the convictions, the split screens, etc, here's what matters—Michael Cohen stood in court and said that the President of the United States directed him to commit a crime.”               
                   
**Cohen’s plea agreement does not explicitly commit him to cooperating with federal investigators in other matters,** such as Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, but it does not preclude cooperation either. He faces three to six years in prison.              
          
**For good measure, Mueller and Trump’s disgraced former national security adviser/cooperating witness [Michael Flynn](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/21/robert-mueller-michael-flynn-sentencing-delay-790639?h_sid=e2dd17d60a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) jointly requested another sentencing delay,** suggesting Flynn has provided Mueller valuable information and may still be providing useful cooperation.      
               
**For someone who attacks his political rivals for being soft on crime, Trump sure does cozy up to a ton of criminals!**                      
              
**Seriously, though, Donald Trump is in big trouble.**

**On Monday night, hundreds of protesters at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill toppled the “[Silent Sam](https://abc11.com/protesters-knock-down-silent-sam-statue-on-unc-campus/4012908/?h_sid=e2dd17d60a-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)” Confederate statue on the school’s campus.** The protesters said they gathered in solidarity with Maya Little, a graduate student who was facing criminal charges and expulsion for covering the statue in paint and her own blood last year. UNC and the state government have responded by focusing on the destruction of public property, incensing those calling for the removal of similar monuments around the country.

The destructive California wildfires recently drew attention to prison labor issues after it became public that inmates who fought the fires were compensated with only $1/hour, and an additional $2/day. A provision in the 13th amendment of the Constitution allows for indentured servitude as punishment for a crime, which has allowed prisons to get away with implementing what’s been called “modern slavery” for years.

**Trump himself has now responded to the events, but is not treating them equally.** On one hand, there’s Paul Manafort—soon after his guilty verdict was handed down, Trump [praised him](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1032256443985084417) as a brave man who “refused to break” and share information on him with prosecutors. On the other is [Michael Cohen](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1032247043992023040), whose guilty plea has [directly implicated Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/nyregion/michael-cohen-plea-deal-trump.html?h_sid=4ff5d86ae9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) in a violation of federal campaign finance law.                
              
**Trump and the White House are now attempting to run what can only be described as the most disastrous attempt at damage control** since O.J. Simpson released “If I Did It: Confession of the Killer.” He told [Fox News](https://twitter.com/foxandfriends/status/1032319321920430080) that the payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, which he once claimed not to even know of, came from his personal account rather than campaign funds. This indicates that he has [no fucking idea](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/22/17770074/fox-and-friends-trump-cohen-campaign-finance-payment?h_sid=4ff5d86ae9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) what is and is not a campaign finance law violation. Later, in the press briefing, [Sarah Huckabee Sanders](https://twitter.com/chrisgeidner/status/1032336302119825408) managed to repeat the same three talking points in response to repeated questions about Trump’s lies and criminal liability: “The president has done nothing wrong,” “he faces no charges,” and “there is no collusion.” She is officially worse than Sean Spicer. Congrats, Sean.                   
             
**Cohen’s role in all this is far from over.**  Today, New York state investigators [issued a subpoena to Cohen](https://twitter.com/MikeDelMoro/status/1032343182737133568) in the probe into the Trump Foundation after his attorney said he had information that would be of interest to them. Meanwhile, Cohen’s lawyer Lanny Davis is on television confirming that Cohen was present for a conversation between Don Jr. and President Trump [about the Trump Tower meeting](https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1032395729099214848) that Trump claimed to not know about. That’s a big deal! And that happened just now!               
           
**Beyond the legal implications (which are… huge), there is the political fallout.**          
              
**Democrats pushed back on Republicans' decision to move forward with a confirmation hearing for Trump's SCOTUS nominee [Brett Kavanaugh](https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/1032328657358991361),** citing Trump’s alleged involvement in Cohen’s federal crimes. [Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI)](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/22/mazie-hirono-kavanaugh-confirmation-trump-cohen-791413?h_sid=4ff5d86ae9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) was the first to announce she had canceled her meeting with Kavanaugh in the wake of Cohen’s plea, saying she would not interview a judge for a lifetime appointment for a president who is an “unindicted co-conspirator in a criminal matter” with others quickly following suit.       
             
**However, some, like [Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME)](https://twitter.com/StevenTDennis/status/1032336244527845384), remain unchanged.** Collins, who is viewed as a deciding vote on Kavanaugh, said today she sees “no basis” for delaying such hearings. And Democratic [Sen. Joe Manchin (WV)](https://twitter.com/ChadPergram/status/1032365763426844672) agrees, saying the Senate “has a job to do” when it comes to Kavanaugh.                  
         
**Senators' positions take on additional importance given the fact that Kavanaugh's commitment to holding a president responsible for his actions is [not clear](https://www.businessinsider.com/brett-kavanaugh-opinions-on-impeachment-and-indictment-2018-7?h_sid=4ff5d86ae9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).** In the past, he’s expressed hesitation to investigating or indicting a sitting president—circumstances that after yesterday, our current sitting president is only more likely to face.

**On Tuesday, the [DNC contacted the FBI about an attempted hack](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/22/politics/democratic-national-committee-voter-database/index.html?h_sid=4ff5d86ae9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) into their voter database.** On the same day, [Microsoft](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/21/politics/microsoft-russia-american-politicians/index.html?h_sid=4ff5d86ae9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) reported that the same Russian military intelligence unit that targeted the 2016 elections was now targeting the Senate, as well as conservative think tanks pushing for tougher Russia policies, and comes less than three months ahead of the midterm elections.

**Trump’s former lawyer-turned-felon [Michael Cohen](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/22/michael-cohen-paid-a-mysterious-tech-company-50000-in-connection-with-trumps-campaign.html?h_sid=4ff5d86ae9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;__source=twitter%7Cmain) made a previously unreported $50,000 payment to an unidentified tech company in 2016,** reportedly in connection with the Trump campaign. The company and the payment’s purpose are currently unknown, but the payment raises questions about what else Cohen was handling for Trump.             
            
**Hawaii is currently [facing a major emergency](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/22/us/hurricane-lane-hawaii-wxc/index.html?h_sid=4ff5d86ae9-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) with Category 4 storm Hurricane Lane—the strongest hurricane to ever threaten the islands.** Hurricanes are a rare threat for the island, and the storm—newly downgraded from Category 5—comes soon after months of catastrophic eruptions and volcanic activity.

Steve King (R-IA)’s race was just moved from solid Republican to likely Republican** by [*Cook Political Report*](https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1032304038514049026).

Also, a fire department begging Verizon for bandwidth to fight a wildfire but getting stuck dealing with customer service is pretty dystopian, even for 2018.

**At the same time, new polling from New Jersey shows the Senate race between incumbent Democrat [Bob Menendez](https://twitter.com/SteveKornacki/status/1032288441365614592) and his Republican challenger’s narrowing, 43-37.** Menendez was previously indicted on 18 counts of corruption and Democrats are hammering an anti-corruption message nationwide.

**Donnie Brasc-Nope**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump is publicly promoting mafia values to protect himself from multiple criminal investigations. And it may be working.**             
        
**In a Fox News interview that aired Thursday morning, Trump [said](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/23/politics/trump-flipping-outlawed/index.html?h_sid=4b3909f00d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) he thinks “it almost ought to be illegal”** for prosecutors to pressure suspects and convicts to “flip,” which involves helping investigators build cases against more important criminal targets, in exchange for leniency. This is a tactic all prosecutors use, and that both Special Counsel Robert Mueller and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York are deploying against Trump.                     
                     
**Trump has been [portraying](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/us/politics/trump-sessions-russia-investigation.html?h_sid=4b3909f00d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) Mueller’s team as [corrupt](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/19/politics/trump-joseph-mccarthy-tweet/index.html?h_sid=4b3909f00d-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), and his convicted former campaign chairman Paul Manafort as a victim, for weeks.** We saw how this plays with some Trump supporters on Wednesday night, when one of the MAGA-hat wearing jurors in Manafort’s trial [appeared on Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/08/23/manafort-juror-reveals-lone-holdout-prevented-mueller-team-from-winning-conviction-on-all-counts.html) and made multiple revealing admissions:              
               
- She was biased at the outset of the trial in Manafort’s favor, and only concluded he was guilty of all the charges against him reluctantly.               
           
- A single, stubborn juror (other than her) caused the jury to hang on 10 of the 18 charges.          
              
- Part of her sympathy for Manafort stemmed from the fact that, in her words, he got swept up in a “witch hunt to try to find Russian collusion.”          
              
**From Brian:** This juror did the right thing, and should be commended for it, but it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that, in a case about “Russian collusion,” or any case that reached Trump directly, prosecutors will have a hard time securing a completely untainted jury. More than half of all Trump supporters already believe Trump is the victim of a Justice Department conspiracy, and it only takes one committed Trump supporter out of 12 to spoil a case. (One nearly spoiled Manafort’s!) Even in heavily Democratic precincts like Washington, DC and New York City, Trump’s odds are pretty good—so long as his supporters continue to embrace his conspiracy theories and his gangster ethics.

**Ammar Campa-Najjar, the 29-year-old, half-Mexican, half-Arabic, progressive Democrat running in a conservative district against recently indicted Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA), is facing (despicable) Republican attacks** because his grandfather (whom he never met, and has disavowed) helped organize the Palestinian hostage-taking and murder of Israeli olympians in Munich, Germany in 1972.                        
             
Campa-Najjar has the perfect retort: “If Hunter has to go back three generations to attack me, that must mean I’m a pretty clean candidate, I can go back two days ago and tell you an indictment he had.”

**“Broken Windows” policing has little to do with actual broken windows and a lot to do with harassing (disproportionately black) people who commit petty crimes.** The theory is that taking a hard line against minor offenses will deter people contemplating more serious crimes. But what if instead of trying to nab turn-style jumpers, cities deployed resources to clean up blight in the neighborhoods where “broken windows” policing is most common?                            
         
“[Researchers were] surprised by the findings from their first study, published in the *American Journal of Public Health*, which showed a thirty-nine-per-cent reduction in gun violence in and around remediated abandoned buildings and a smaller—but still meaningful—five-per-cent reduction in gun violence in and around remediated lots…. Equally powerful…was that there was no evidence that the violence had simply shifted to nearby places. The declines were real. And they lasted from one to nearly four years.”

Rhodes is currently doing his stint on Crooked Conversations, so it may generate interest?What else should I listen to in addition to Crooked Media?

I’m getting into “What’s Left” from Buzzfeed - I thought the socialism episode was terrific and as nuanced a description of socialism as I’ve ever seen (this is coming from someone who doesn’t necessarily identify is that).

I’m not exactly a Chapo-type viewer either, though, and don’t plan to be.

**Weisselberghazi**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Federal law enforcement has breached the walls of the Trump Organization, potentially opening a vast new front of legal exposure for the president and his family.**           
           
**In the course of investigating hush-money payments Michael Cohen made to silence Donald Trump’s former mistresses** ahead of the 2016 election, federal prosecutors from the southern district of New York granted immunity to the Trump Organization’s chief financial officer, [Allen Weisselberg](https://www.wsj.com/articles/allen-weisselberg-longtime-trump-organization-cfo-is-granted-immunity-by-federal-prosecutors-in-michael-cohen-investigation-1535121992?h_sid=90058a7445-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)—the one person reported to have as much visibility into Trump’s business practices, legal and illegal, as Trump himself.                
             
**The fact that Weisselberg was given immunity means he was in real legal jeopardy** and agreed to cooperate with investigators to make that problem go away. It’s possible prosecutors gave him immunity simply to investigate the [campaign finance violations Cohen already pleaded guilty to](https://twitter.com/rgoodlaw/status/1033015288328073221). But even if Weisselberg has thus far only provided information about Cohen, he may [still be obligated](https://twitter.com/renato_mariotti/status/1033030595914416131) to cooperate with other investigations, including the one Special Counsel Robert Mueller is leading.              
                  
**Weisselberg’s cooperation makes Trump’s potential legal jeopardy all-encompassing:** his private business, his family, his campaign, and his administration are all vulnerable. Even if prosecutors never ask Weisselberg for any information about Trump beyond the hush-money payments, Trump is still exposed to:                    
               
- The Mueller investigation          
        
- The SDNY’s investigation of Cohen and the **National Enquirer**         
        
- A DOJ [public integrity investigation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gop-fundraiser-broidy-under-investigation-for-alleged-effort-to-sell-government-influence-people-familiar-with-probe-say/2018/08/17/c9e55792-a185-11e8-8e87-c869fe70a721_story.html?h_sid=90058a7445-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;noredirect=on) of former RNC Deputy Finance Chair Elliott Broidy, who allegedly tried to sell access to the Trump administration                
              
- [Charges in Manhattan](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/manhattan-da-investigation-cohen?h_sid=90058a7445-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) stemming from the way the Trump Organization recorded reimbursements of the hush-money payments

**And that’s just what’s public.**               
              
**From Brian:** Not all of these distinct, overlapping lines of inquiry will necessarily touch Trump. But some of them likely will, and there’s little Trump can do to stop it. For over a year now, we have been worried, for good reason, that Trump might fire Robert Mueller and try to shut down the Russia investigation. It’s still an important concern, but at this point that would only obstruct one avenue of his legal exposure. There’s nothing he can do about his exposure in New York state, and pragmatically speaking, he won’t be able make three separate federal criminal investigations go away. He can’t fire and pardon his way out of the mess he’s made anymore.

A month ago, Trump claimed he had “[largely solved](https://twitter.com/shaneharris/status/1033048876708716544)” the North Korea nuclear crisis. This leaves us with two questions: Why won’t liberals give him credit for this stunning success, and did they cancel the trip fast enough to halt production on the commemorative coin?

**["WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING" — A Bad Lip Reading](https://youtu.be/8EsUNOIYyKg)**This is something I've thought about a bit lately, as Crooked Media is nearly of one mind regarding it's political stances, especially as demonstrated through The Wilderness. 

&amp;#x200B;

This has gotten me thinking: are Friends of the Pod similarly of one mind? What's a political goal of yours that you haven't seen brought up in any of the podcasts? I'll include mine in the comments so as not to sway things one way or the other.So I am a guy living in Europe, where my politics align with the central parties in the two countries in which I have lived (Norway and the Netherlands). This is possible because there is no two party system like in the US and there tend to be parties for centrists, people right-of-center, left-of-center and on both extremes of the political divide. There's something for everyone. However, with this not being the case in the US, I am curious about you guys' opinion on these two questions:

First, should the dems take more moderate positions to people who (like me, should I ever live in the US) would never vote for Trump, but are also not entirely at home with some of the more hard-left^(1) ideas, such as increasing the size of the supreme court (as shitty as McConnel and his actions are) or - this is not my personal opinion, I'm all for universal healthcare - people who aren't as big fans of UH as Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez?

Second, and related to that: It is completely understandable that dems are more enthusiastic about people such as Beto and Ocasio-Cortez, but someone caucusing with dems in the senate (or house) but doesn't share those two's ideals is still better than a republican - people like Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp. However, based on what I read on this sub and on /r/politics, it almost seems like people are unwilling to make (as much) effort for dems who aren't as left as Sanders. Is this the case?

I don't live in the US and PSA is the only America-focused political podcast I listen to, so I don't have an as-clear view as most US-based people would have, so some clarification would be kick-ass and greatly appreciated.

PS: One of the reasons I am asking this is because I saw a comment calling people who weren't for universal healthcare "traitors to the left", which was a little shocking*"I wish I was part of the Illuminati. Don't they run the World? I'm just selling ice cream."—The owner of a Toronto ice cream shop who has been targeted and harassed by [far-right conspiracy theorists](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/secret-message-board-drives-pizzagate-style-harassment-campaign-small-businesses-n903696?h_sid=2a2f13e918-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84)*            
                        
**John McCain**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**[Sen. John McCain (R-AZ)](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/25/us/politics/john-mccain-funeral.html?nl=morning-briefing&amp;emc=edit_nn_20180826&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=Top+Stories&amp;h_sid=2a2f13e918-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;nlid=61125954emc%3Dedit_nn_20180826&amp;action=click&amp;te=1), who died of brain cancer on Saturday at age 81, will be memorialized in Washington this week.**                
          
**McCain will lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda and receive a full dress funeral at the Washington National Cathedral.** Such a ceremony is fairly standard for politicians of McCain’s stature, but because Donald Trump is an irredeemable person, the whole thing is playing out as an extended critique of him. And, also because he’s an irredeemable person, Trump is already proving the critique correct.           
                    
**In [a farewell statement](https://www.johnmccain.com/2018/08/farewell-statement-from-senator-john-mccain/?h_sid=2a2f13e918-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), McCain described America as a “nation of ideals, not blood and soil,”** which we weaken “when we hide behind walls, rather than tear them down.” Under normal circumstances, the statement would read as a fairly ordinary invocation of American ideals, but because Trump is contemptuous of those ideals, it reads (intentionally!) as a criticism of the president.               
                    
**[Trump](https://www.vox.com/2018/8/27/17786018/john-mccain-trump-funeral-flag-tweet?h_sid=2a2f13e918-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) underscored how deserving he is of the critique by, at first, refusing to fly White House flags at half staff until McCain’s burial** and [declining to issue a formal proclamation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-rejected-plans-for-a-white-house-statement-praising-mccain/2018/08/26/0d0478e4-a967-11e8-8f4b-aee063e14538_story.html?h_sid=2a2f13e918-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;utm_term=.a3897465dc81&amp;noredirect=on) about his death. After intense internal and external pressure, including an [open letter from the American Legion](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/27/us/politics/flag-half-staff-mccain-trump.html?h_sid=2a2f13e918-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), Trump reversed himself, but the whole week promises to be a test of whether Trump can restrain his inner, petty asshole.                 
               
**Thanks for the Suggestions, GOP**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Republicans are making their willingness to help President Trump cover up his crimes and corruption** a part of their campaign strategy coming midterm elections.                    
           
**House Republicans have [compiled a list](https://www.axios.com/2018-midterm-elections-republicans-preparation-investigations-180abf7b-0de8-4670-ae8a-2e6da123c584.html?h_sid=2a2f13e918-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), which *Axios* published over the weekend,** of issues they expect Democrats to investigate if they claim control of the House in November. It’s based on inquiries and requests Democrats have already made in the minority, without subpoena power.                    
                   
**Democrats should take the list and say well, fuck yeah this is what we’ll investigate. It’s a compilation of Trump’s corrupt acts, and the ethical scandals** that have consumed his White House and most of his cabinet. It also includes huge governing failures—the travel ban, family separation, the abandonment of hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, failure to secure U.S. elections.             
                  
**Republicans in Congress have wilfully ignored all of these abuses.**                
                    
**The thought of Congress investigating these issues has “churned Republican stomachs,”** according to *Axios*, because they believe thorough oversight is “among the greatest threats to [Trump’s] presidency.”        
              
**It’s seems Republicans have left themselves little choice** other than to lean into their collective decision to protect Trump at all cost.               
            
**The GOP Congress has been historically ineffectual, and its largest achievement—a multi-trillion dollar corporate tax cut—is wildly unpopular.** And so, having completely ceded the center, their best hope for avoiding electoral defeat is to turn Trump loyalists out to the polls in large numbers. Trump will only help turn them out if he realize how severe the threat to his presidency is, and Trump loyalists might even turn themselves out if they realize House Republicans are the last firewall between Trump and accountability to the broader public.                  
           
**From Brian:** Republicans are right about two things. They have nothing to offer the public other than capitulation to Trump, and they can’t complete the coverup on his behalf if they don’t retain the House in November. It’s our job to prove them right—win and provide oversight. Otherwise, Trump will get away with his bad deeds and be emboldened to commit more of them.

However, the framework does not yet include Canada—the third country in the North American Free Trade Agreement—and may amount to nothing, which is weird coming from the guy who single-handedly denuclearized the Korean peninsula.

Remember, we're talking about:

1. Moving roughly 100m people off their existing insurance, 80% of whom say they like their existing insurance.
2. At the same time we would significantly raise taxes on the middle class.

It would make the ACA look uncontroversial by comparison.

Given that every Dem Senator after numbers 55/56/57 is probably going to be winning with less than 2% of the vote, it seems likely that not ever Dem Senator would be willing to end their political career with this vote, so the 60-vote minimum isn't enough. You're going to need more. How many do we realistically think it would take?

**The Tussle over Russell**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Democrats are pretty good at trolling Republicans over the fact that their voting base is insane,** but very bad at stopping Republicans from handing that base huge victories—in today’s case, lifetime federal judgeships for Trump nominees.       
               
**Earlier this week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer proposed [renaming the Russell Senate office building](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/us/politics/russell-senate-building-mccain.html?h_sid=92cad8e05c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) (which currently commemorates the segregationist Democrat Richard Russell) after the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ).** This gesture was both earnest and cunning: Schumer and McCain were close. They [co-wrote a comprehensive immigration reform bill](https://www.politico.com/story/2013/01/immigration-reform-deal-senate-schumer-mccain-86840_Page3.html?h_sid=92cad8e05c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84#primaryNav) that passed the Senate in 2013. Last year, McCain [helped](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/8/25/17782664/john-mccain-legacy-obamacare-repeal-thumbs-down?h_sid=92cad8e05c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) Schumer kill President Trump’s plan to repeal Obamacare.      
               
**But Schumer also knows that many Republican voters both dislike McCain and support monuments to segregationists and Confederate generals, which likely explains why Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell [rejected Schumer’s plan](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/28/642592039/momentum-slows-for-renaming-senate-building-for-mccain?h_sid=92cad8e05c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), just three days after McCain died of brain cancer.       
               
**The Republican base is so blindly loyal to Trump, and Republicans so scared of their base,** that McConnell is stuck honoring a terrible segregationist rather than his dearly departed friend. How embarrassing! (Also, that is the last time we will ever include the words “Mitch McConnell” and “honor” in the same sentence.)      
               
**However, McConnell came out ahead in the tussle with his Democratic counterpart.** After he denied Schumer’s request to honor McCain, Schumer turned around and [agreed to fast track seven more of Trump’s judicial nominees](https://twitter.com/StewSays/status/1034533414672711680) today. What’s the opposite of a quid pro quo?       
               
**Presumably Democratic leaders would rather have their vulnerable members out campaigning** instead of stuck in Washington fighting over whether to confirm lower-court nominees. But these judges will be on the bench for decades, shaping and making law long after Trump is gone. There isn’t much Senate floor time left on the legislative calendar, and by making McConnell eat up several days for each nominee, Democrats could probably stop at least some of these nominees from being confirmed. That’d be better (for party politics and for the country) than a dumb fight over what senators call their office building.

**If [Vote Save America](https://votesaveamerica.com/?h_sid=92cad8e05c-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) had been around in 2006, maybe this wouldn't have happened.**          
                
**Kat McPhee on Twitter: "[voting matters 🙃 register here: https://bit.ly/1hQVkcZ  #midterms2018](https://twitter.com/katharinemcphee/status/1034491726969241600)"**I’ve never been a hardcore conservative - mostly a low-key conservative, who thinks that unnecessary spending must be cut and that government should be limited in case we end up with people like Trump screwing everything over. In that sense, I’m still a conservative, but I can’t justify voting for the GOP. 

I thought Trump was absolutely terrible, but that GOP policies were acceptable for some time. Basically after Rubio dropped out, I was team Hillary.

I was upset when Trump won. Still, I called balls and strikes on Trump and on the GOP for a solid year, figuring that doing so would be “fair.” It was becoming harder and harder: Muslim ban and Charlottesville. I couldn’t justify ACA repeal when so many people would be hurt. I care mostly about getting rid of actually wasteful spending and not expanding the government further, not about screwing with people’s lives and families and livings. There’s a big difference. 

Then, family separation happened, and what shocked me wasn’t that Trump was inhumane enough to do this, but that the rest of the GOP didn’t seem to think there was much wrong with it. Especially as a first generation American, I couldn’t stand this.

Around this time, I started listening to Pod Save America rather than some of the conservative podcasts I would follow. I couldn’t listen to people justifying family separation any more. I couldn’t listen to people who I used to think were sane saying that immigrants had no right to complain because service members are regularly away from their kids, or talk about fences vs cages, as if it made a fucking difference. Despite disagreeing with a lot of it, listening to the hosts of PodSave I knew that they were motivated by basic morality over anything else. There is no morality in locking children in cages and beating them and starving them and keeping them away from their parents, and while we need secure borders, we cannot do this to anyone, especially since the legal immigration system  is broken and I don’t see republicans running over to fix it. 

While I can’t say that I now agree with all or even most of the things PSA says about policy, I have to say that when it comes to basic morals, they’re pretty much right. Listening has convinced me that I can’t call balls and strikes on what the GOP has become. I can’t imagine anything but voting downballot Dem this year, even if I don’t agree with the policy proposals - this insanity needs to end, and no so called “moderates” like Rubio or Ryan are even standing up against these horrible actions. 

I used to think that Republicans were the ones rooted in facts (though, I’ve never been registered as one because I was never quite comfortable with the party) but they’re obviously not, at least not anymore.

It’s not just PSA that’s changed my mind. I know that I’d much rather take Dem policy extremism over white nationalism. My other reading and listening and watching has challenged me as well. 

Anyway, felt like sharing that. As much of an echo chamber as PSA can be, it has challenged my ideas a lot, and I feel like listening to it has made me think a lot more on what exactly the Republican Party is. 
It could very well be a recency bias (eg there's always something more important/immediate in the 15-minute news cycle that is the modern political landscape) but it seems like a set of issues that are really really important but have fallen pretty darn hard by the wayside. Am I just misremembering? Or is this something other listeners have also noticed?My support for Obama waffled a lot in 2012, after he did things like: pretended he wasn’t for gay marriage until the majority supported it, [stuck behind his administration’s conservative plan B decision](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/08/health/policy/sebelius-overrules-fda-on-freer-sale-of-emergency-contraceptives.html), descended Libya into chaos, and gave corrupt politicians and bankers a pass. But, overall, I thought he was a decent person and that made me ignore political red flags. So, I convinced myself to vote for him again in 2012. But now, after listening to podcasts like this and reading books written by Obama’s biggest supporters, I can’t ignore the fact that these people don’t want to bring up, assess, and defend or condemn his worst decisions. I still respect him as a person, but what does that say about him as a president? Is his legacy that fragile?*"I know about a 'monkey wrench'. I've heard of 'don't monkey around'.

**Hear Some Evil**
------------------------------------------------------------------------
**With primary season winding down, Republicans are lifting the curtain on a general election strategy.** Surprise: It’s modeled on the historically racist, conspiratorial, dishonest campaign Donald Trump ran in 2016.       
               
**The epicenter of this campaign will be in Florida. On Tuesday, Andrew Gillum—the progressive, African American mayor of Tallahassee**—unexpectedly defeated his establishment-backed rivals to win the Democratic gubernatorial primary.        
               
**By Wednesday morning, Gillum’s Republican opponent—a House backbencher and [notorious Trump sycophant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?h_sid=fb420d7622-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;v=2BYgM7yWgkY#action=share) named Ron DeSantis**—went [full-bore racist](https://twitter.com/stevemorris__/status/1034800249985003521), calling Gillum “articulate” and warning Florida voters not to “monkey things up” in Florida by voting for him. Less than a day—that’s how long it took for this guy to go there.        
               
**If you’re wondering whether DeSantis might’ve put his foot in his mouth unintentionally, watch the video.** It was so clearly scripted that Sandra Smith, an anchor for Fox News—*Fox News*!—[condemned his language](https://www.thewrap.com/fox-news-anchor-publicly-rebukes-ron-desantis-after-monkey-remarks-we-do-not-condone-this-language/?h_sid=fb420d7622-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).        
               
**DeSantis is one of the House Republicans leading the effort to obstruct and undermine Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.** He introduced legislation that would have [shut Mueller down](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/08/29/ron-desantis-wants-to-shorten-probe-into-trump-russia-ties/612029001/?h_sid=fb420d7622-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) after six months. He has fed a bad-faith right-wing campaign to discredit the investigation as a corrupt conspiracy against Trump by [asking the Justice Department](https://desantis.house.gov/2018/4/desantis-leads-criminal-referral-to-justice-department-regarding-comey-mccabe-clinton-strzok-and-others?h_sid=fb420d7622-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) to criminally investigate James Comey, Hillary Clinton, and basically everybody who was present when the FBI began the Russia probe.        
               
**But DeSantis’s surrogates in the Florida GOP are gearing up to attack Gillum because of an ongoing FBI investigation of members of the city government in Tallahassee.** FBI investigations are serious business to Republicans—when they’re against Democrats.        
               
**Culture war nonsense and situational ethics aren’t unique to DeSantis’ campaign.** In Texas, for example, Republicans supporting Ted Cruz are [smearing Beto O’Rourke](https://twitter.com/TexasGOP/status/1034591481892405249) for getting arrested shortly after he graduated from college. (Cruz most recently supported the Senate candidacy of credibly accused child molester [Roy Moore](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a13994613/ted-cruz-roy-moore-al-franken/?h_sid=fb420d7622-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), and supported President Trump’s decision to pardon race-baiting felon-propagandist [Dinesh D’Souza](https://www.texastribune.org/2018/06/01/cruz-details-dinesh-dsouza-pardon-donald-trump/?h_sid=fb420d7622-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84).)        
               
**Trump continues to set the tone for Republican candidates everywhere by lying, scapegoating immigrants, and promoting conspiracy theories.** He is currently ginning up the baseless claim that Google is suppressing Republican-friendly websites, which also seems designed to delegitimize election results should Republicans lose.        
               
**From Brian:** It’s not unusual for negative campaign tactics to be hypocritical, but Republicans are banking on the assumption that the political press will cover their attacks uncritically, without accounting for the fact that the GOP has hitched its wagon to Trump, and all of his grossness and corruption. They can only get away with running the shameless campaign they want to run if we let them.

According to the *Washington Post*, “In some cases, passport applicants with official U.S. birth certificates are being jailed in immigration detention centers and entered into deportation proceedings.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
**President Trump is preparing to thrust the country into a crisis as soon as the midterm elections are behind him,** and Republicans are lining up to make sure he gets away with it.       
               
**On Wednesday, Trump effectively fired his White House counsel, [Don McGahn](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/29/politics/don-mcgahn-brett-kavanaugh-donald-trump-tweet/index.html?h_sid=8cacb05141-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84), by announcing on Twitter that McGahn will leave the administration in the fall.** McGahn has reportedly stood in the way of Trump’s efforts to pardon his former campaign chairman [Paul Manafort](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/donald-trump-nuts-rejects-war-council-intervention-goes-it-alone?h_sid=8cacb05141-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84&amp;mbid=social_twitter) and [fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/us/politics/don-mcgahn-white-house-counsel-trump.html?h_sid=8cacb05141-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84). He also sat for 30 hours worth of [interviews](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/18/us/politics/don-mcgahn-mueller-investigation.html?h_sid=8cacb05141-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) with Mueller’s investigators.       
               
**Meanwhile, Senate Republicans are making peace with McGahn’s departure and Trump’s intent to fire Attorney General [Jeff Sessions](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/30/politics/jeff-sessions-hill-gop-trump/index.html?h_sid=8cacb05141-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** so long as Trump [waits until after Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/8/23/17773828/trump-fire-sessions-senate-mueller?h_sid=8cacb05141-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84) to the Supreme Court. In doing so, they’re helping Trump lay groundwork to make his most obstructive moves yet during the lame-duck period between the November election and when the new Congress is seated in January.       
               
**In the event that Republicans lose the House and Senate, Trump could use the lame-duck to [fire Sessions](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-30/trump-says-sessions-is-safe-at-least-until-the-november-election?h_sid=8cacb05141-59d5592b0a21f78c3a091e84),** replace him with someone who will subvert the Mueller investigation, and pardon Manafort—the most important witness in the collusion investigation.       
               
**By the time Democrats were to come to power, there’d be little they could do to set things right.**       
               
**From Brian:** Trump appears to have concluded that Mueller poses an existential risk to his presidency and possibly his freedom. He is determined to do whatever is in his power to protect himself from the Russia investigation and Republicans are increasingly resigned to it. Ironically, Democrats are better situated to stop Trump now than they will be after the election, if they can get their act together and delay the Kavanaugh confirmation. But on the current course, a crisis seems inevitable.

**KT NELSON on Twitter: "[the kent state gun girl went on infowars to defend her self-own and somehow deepened the wound](https://twitter.com/KrangTNelson/status/1035274173483048960)"**Basically admitting that he’s probably going to vote for Rick Scott in the Florida Senate race should put a nail in the coffin of this asshole’s regular appearances on Crooked pods. Just because someone in the GOP hates that Trump says the quiet stuff loud doesn’t mean they’re an ally, especially when they’re happy to vote for a Trump supplicant as long as they vaguely pretend that they dislike the president. The Republican Party is rotten to its core and there are no worthwhile people left in it.👍well done🖒Yea, AND most of Puerto Rico doesn’t have electricity so how would they even see TV.Wasn't there a poll that said something 45% of Americans didn't know.......I am saying, yes he doesn't know.OK, the Harry's ad is back, so I'm reminded again: Is it a great idea to promote your *German* factory as having *over 100 years* of experience making blades?
In my head I always go "Harry's! Our blades were good enough for Hitler, so they're good enough for you!" Harry’s is always there for PSA lol. People and Lovett are the only two that switched to DSC I think.Splattered him across the wall, my dudeOf all the reasons not to listen to a political podcast...I didn't say I didn't listen to it. All I did was skip the 10 minutes they were talking about Kaepernick.Get him, Favs!There were a few WTF moments from him, although I always enjoy hearing from him. No, terry schiavo was not the first time the GOP sought to regulate what someone did with their body. I'm excusing the "keep telling yourself out" line because he probably was in a hostile crowd (at least for him) full of liberals.  I do think that Dems  need to look beyond the polls and statistics and figure out what the hell is going on538 ran [some numbers on it](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/colin-kaepernick-is-not-supposed-to-be-unemployed/) pointing towards Kaepernick's not being employed being unusual.https://strawpoll.com/s7r772wb

Who is the barker, Leo or Pundit?There’s something kind of hilarious about the fact that his is actually his second most popular tweet while his most popular by far is the one about boxing photos looking like gay weddings. Friend of the pod! I can't excuse it anymore because of how ubiquitous it's become. If it's something that's so obvious, it should have manifested itself in a much clearer way by this point, and yet, I dont think it has.You should make these into phone wallpaper size!I generally make them for IG, so they are in squares, but I'd be happy to format them for anything else. What's a standard size for phones, 1920x1080?Did you try it with the same format top and bottom? "idealistic" bolded and "&amp; Disappointed" below. In the UK the labour party are always branded as the naive, dumb and optimistic party and the conservative party as the cynical and smart party. Even when people with university degrees are more likely to be left leaning.I think i did initially. I ended up keeping the "positive" in the lighter font and the "pessimism" in blocky all-caps.WAIT. that guy was actually Cruz’s roommate? I thought he was doing a bit. Lol lol That’s one of them I think! Awesome lol.Did you miss the part where Jon genuinely asked whether Kaepernick was good enough to be on a team? And also the NFL union criticism is valid as well lol.They all said they don't watch sports, how would any of them know of Kaep is good enough for the NFL.

The criticism of the NFLPA definitely is valid. They are the weakest of any of the sports unions. They asked the audience? And the audience said yeah so Lovett took their words for it lol. And that’s exactly word for word what they said about the union. The segment was like 4 minutes long lol. Here's the QB depth chart for all of the teams in the league;
https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/depth-chart

Do you really not think he's better than guys like Mike Glennon, Brian Hoyer, Colt McCoy, Kellen Clemons, or Matt Moore?

I agree that he may not be an average starting QB but he'd easily be one of the better backups in the league.And all I did was skip again 4 minutes. I don't know you're so bent out of shape over my critique. But just because I don't agree that Kaep belongs in the NFL doesn't mean I disagree with his message and anything he stands for. Yeah he's definitely better than Colt McCoy and Matt Moore lol. The argument has been that he's a top 20 QB which he absolutely is not.

But a decent backup, yes he is.I’m just saying that’s a weird reason to feel so offended that you have to tell everyone that it offended you because of the audience saying Kaepernick was good enough to be on a team. Am I not allowed to have a critique? Am I not allowed to have an opinion? I don't get why you're so bent out of shape over this. I guess because you're the mod here you take it a little personal but this isn't like I wrote off the entire podcast and I'm never listening again.

I had a complaint. I aired it. We've actually had a nice discussion about this in here aside from you coming at me so hard.I’m coming at you hard? That’s hilarious. I’m genuinely confused about your criticism because it seems like a huge grievance on 4 minutes within a long podcast episode. I just don’t know what talking about football or proving you know more about football accomplished and why you’re so defensive thinking my genuine confusion as “coming at me so hard”Haha yeah he is definitely not a top 20 QB, not even close. Anyone who says he is definitely doesn't know much about football.I'm defensive? Look at you man. Commenting multiple times on multiple posts about this. This clearly irks you. Just because Kaepernick isn't good enough for the NFL doesn't mean anything he says is invalid. His skill is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.

But I'm done with this argument. You don't strike me as someone who wants to have a genuine discussion, you just want to shout me down.Because you keep commenting lol? You can keep commenting but I for some reason have to stop?

I don’t care if he’s good enough for the NFL. It’s so insignificant in the grand scheme of things that I found it odd that you had to air a 3-paragraph grievance on it. Their comments, all 4-minutes of it, were prefaced that they don’t know football. The audience screamed “yes” when Lovett asked whether he was good enough for NFL. The only thing they said was that Kaepernick still doesn’t have a job. I don’t really know why that rubbed you the wrong way, hence my asking.

I guess you just assume that my comments were hostile because you think NFL knowledge should be the basis of all discussion? I bet it smells of mashed potatoes with hints of impotence Also, what “multiple posts” are you talking about? Are you confusing me with other people who doesn’t care about NFL?Yeah for some reason people think he's still the same man from 2013 that they saw play in the Super Bowl. fritos and EDAny word if they will be selling merch at the shows? I missed the last round from Cotton Bureau. I'm doing the VIP as well, but want shirt if I can.Canadian as well! I listen to all the pods on my commute.  I'm even going to Pod Tours America in Cleveland in a week. I am beyond pumped!I think there will be merch and we as vips will get exclusive merch so I’m excited. It’d better be something like a hat that no one else can get since it’s vip onlyThe live show audience also agreed that Kaepernick would’ve been employed but for politics lol. I guess 538 and the live audience also knows nothing about nfl.I love the segment where Fitzgerald Grant stopped by to read presidential quotes.That's awesome! Haha I almost wish they had added a Canadian city to their tour but that wouldn't make much sense I mean, the whole argument that "his style is out of date" seems a bit subjective, yeah? Like there is not really a way to bring that beyond the level of a barstool debate. You can say that 538, which three fourths of the time is more sports than politics, does not know about football, but ultimately they are actually looking a numbers and stuff that actually correspond to real things.Lets be fair though, 538 making a case is a much better argument than 'a group of LA residents in a comedy club screaming it'. Lets not equate those two arguments.My whole point is that the panel actually asked and the audience was right at the end of the day. It’s not like (what the original comment said) that the panel just screams about Kaepernick should be hired after admitting knowing nothing about football. Also, Lovett’s live audience has been informative in several different episodes that I don’t think it was unreasonable for him to rely on them during the live show.

The segment was also 4 minutes long with only 1 minute (at most) dedicated to him still being unemployed. I just don’t understand the significance in arguing about this at all.Nope! All real: http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ted-cruz-old-roommate-twitter-rant-meeting-heidi-article-1.3222888I am a huge 49er fan. Kaepernick took Gabbert's job last year and was by far the better player. He is an NFL caliber QB, and to argue otherwise is silly.Yikes Heben was a detriment on the show. This has not been the first instance of a panel-member being out of their depth and Lovett sitting idly by either. I get that this show is supposed to be light and breezy  and we can't expect him to fact check everyone all the time. But I hope Lovett is going to become a little more controlling as he gets more comfortable hosting things. I don't think /u/cocaineandmojitos's gripe is about allocation of time. It is about being informed before subjecting others to your opinions. This little trick has been used to death: I'm not a doctor but.., I'm not an Engineer but..., I'm not an aviation expert but.., I'm not a teacher but.. You just lampshade that you don't really know and then get to say whatever you want.

I'd like to hold my podcasters to a higher standard than that.&gt; “Pod save the Right

How about "Pod save my Party"? Maybe one of their NeverTrump friends is interested? Really? I always saw her as middle of the road democrat, maybe blue dog. Sure she goes out to Arizona to report on Kelli Ward, but reads very measured doing so.I can agree to that, but it’s not like they were asking for their opinions to be taken in as truths. They never claim that their opinions were anything but and they just feel unjust that this guy is unemployed. Lovett relying on his audience for things he didn’t know and then build an opinion off of the audience’s response was not unprecedented.

538 also showed that the audience (and in turn the argument the panel used) was correct.Listen carefully when she speaks about the working class or midwest voters. She clearly is more concerned with protecting their image than  what's at issue in that moment. If she wasn't, she would have done a much better job covering the Muslim ban, and it *is* a Muslim ban. Great article. I'm glad Lovett asked the question (even if it wasn't to a group of experts) because, it is worth asking.   
He's obviously been ostracized by the league but if we demand a player be treated better or worse BECAUSE of his politics... Well it would be pretty self defeating.[This other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendsofthePod/comments/6nb3gz/crooked_media_wallpaperslockscreens/) had similar lockscreens and I just thought it'd be a great idea to do these haha. I think I will print out one or two and have the guys sign it (if they would sign them) and do a giveaway for those.OUT OUT OUTI know I keep commenting and I apologize but CM is currently hiring a graphic designer! The job listing is on the website!Nice! I hadn't seen those. I'll w/ portrait sized ones when i get a chance.Appreciate it. Listed since June? Someone get on their team already! Relocating not an option for me but I'll shoot them an email anyway, maybe they can point me in the most helpful direction. Thanks!I wanted to apply for their social media management position but they wanted people who are LA based and I’m not lol. Best of luck!!who says he has to start? Are you telling me that he isn't a better quarterback than Scott Tolzein or Jake Ruddock? **Synopsis**:Las Vegas becomes the site of the worst mass shooting in American history, Trump attacks hurricane victims in Puerto Rico, and Tom Price’s flights of fancy come to an end. Then Ta-Nehisi Coates joins Jon, Jon, and Tommy to talk about his new book, *We Were Eight Years in Power: An American Tragedy*. Damn only an hour. Was hoping for longer considering all the shit that's happened since the last episode Lovetts Vegas rant felt like it was ripped from an episode of The West Wing (In the best possible way!) Great episode and I was glad to hear what they all had to say while processing todays events.$41? :(

This is the same price I pay to see world class DJs and rockbands with massive production quality. Gonna have to try and find some aftermarketWhich show are you going to? These tickets are selling at these 3 times more on secondary markets lol.i'll probably head to one of the NYC ones, but I usually have good success with checking up on the facebook group the day of shows. I use this for big music events oftenAh, best of luck!Lovett's rant made me burst into tears and cry the whole ride home from work. He can be so good at speaking hard truths that most people don't want to say. We need more of that in our media.Sometimes Favreau makes comments about Lovett being too ranty, but when Lovett isn't on the show it's very clearly missing something. His rants and Tommy's informed perspective are really what make this podcast great. I'll report back for sure! None of my friends are into it so I'm road tripping with my dad haha!Fingers crossed for sure! One of the best episodes ever. Loved it. Lovett's rant needs to be transcribed and printed for everyone to see. For some reason I always thought Ta-Nehisi Coates was some middle-aged, bearded, professorial type, he sounded like a surprisingly young and cool guy. Also I didn't know he wrote comics. Supposedly one of them happened while he was arguing with some reporters and he just ignored his sudden inability to feel half of his body for a while because he was still trying to win the argument.Almost sounded like Lovett was tearing up a bit during that gun control rant. Live in Las vegas, drive by Mandalay bay every day, and I've been feeling the same way all day.I think this ep helped me figure out why I have issues getting fully on board with WFLT. It's that the podcast advertises as being about "awkward conversations and messy coalitions" yet at the sign of ANY disagreement on the pod Ana gets super uncomfortable and backs off the topic. 

I think it bothers me so much because I definitely do this myself in my own life. But also I want to hear those conversations!! I think it's Lovett who's spoken about having to do the speeches responding to mass shootings time and time again for Obama's statements and memorial services on these things. He and Favreau have been to so many of those memorial services and have met so many families of victims that I'm sure something like Vegas really hits them in a lot of really deep ways. 

Having worked on the periphery of that sort of environment and with friends who do work in it, I don't think it's easy for people to grasp just what a pressure cooker working on the Hill or in the White House can be emotionally- every problem in the country lands on your doorstep, often in the form of people directly impacted by these tragedies sitting down right in front of you and begging for a form of help that you often aren't in a position to provide. It's one thing to see this stuff on the news, it's another thing when you're chatting over coffee and doughnuts with people whose water supply has been poisoned, or whose child has been shot. You should check out his Daily Show interview from a few years ago. He’s a really great interview subject. Text and punctuation can't do it justice, but here's my transcription.:

Minutes 8:00 to 11:22 aprox:

It feels so overwhelming.  And hopeless.  Like the politics all feel frozen, because they are.

Yeah.

And I find myself trying to divide...I just sort of think we do conflate three gigantic, pretty uniquely
American problems.  One is all related to the prevelance and availability of guns.  One is
the fact that we have a massive gun suicide problem, that is what takes the vast majority of lives
with guns in this country and we should always remember that, and that for every mass 
shooting there many more people who will take a gun and and kill
themselves with it.  Research shows over and over again that your finger pulls the trigger but 
the trigger pulls your finger too.  That access to guns makes it more likely for people to
die by suicide.  And that requires mental health interventions and all kinds
of other interventions that we're not doing enough of.  All made worse by the availability
of guns.  And then there's, for lack of a better term, you know, motivated violence.  
Murder because of robbery or grudges
or vendettas or want or drugs or all the other-or domestic violence especially, a huge 
cause of gun violence.  And again, all made worse by the availability of guns, by people
having guns in their homes, by tons and tons of weapons on the street.

And then we have this strange and peculiar national crisis of mass shootings.  
And, it is the hardest and thorniest one, it is the one where, all the proposals feel 
neutered, and ineffective, we need to get big magazines off the streets, we need to get
--this guy it seems like he used an automatic rifle we need figure out how to get that off the street.
But we also need to face up that there is a toxic idea, that has spread, an idea that 
you don't need to be sad and lonely when you die that you can take people with you that
you can go out in a blaze of glory, that you can, that you can be famous for a day, that
you can be special in this moment and it is poisonous, and it's the hardest part about
it and I think--it has to do with mental health and it has to do with something deeper,
and the truth of it is we don't know what to do.  We hear about this idea, the idea of 
a lone wolf.  What is a
lone wolf?  It's a person who got this idea from somewhere, it's a spreading virus.
And, it just keeps happening.  All made worse by the fact that somebody, somebody gets this
idea in their head and there's nothing to stop them.  There's nothing to stop them from
being armed to the teeth, from having incredible firepower that really belongs on a battlefield. There's
no interventions and there's nothing.  We're just vulnerable to it.  What's so frustrating is
about this is this will happen again.  Oh, this is the worst one ever?  It won't be for long.
It won't be for long.  More people will die, and then you'll see the politicians say "There's just no words."
Why don't you have words, why?  Are you suprised?  You shouldn't be.  You shouldn't be
surprised at all.  It's going to happen again, it's going to happen in a month,
this is giving somebody else an idea.  Somebody's going to watch this, and they're gonna
have the idea.  Nothing's going to stand in their way.  And we're going to realize after the fact
that we couldn't stop that person.  And that's going to happen again and again and again.  And
we should face that, because that's what's happening.  There is no, right now there is
no hope to stop this, there is no interest on the part of Congress, there are
too many powerful lobbyists and there aren't enough people in Congress who want to do
something.  I don't know.  Would you mind me sharing your hard work of transcribing in my personal facebook page?Thank you so much for your hard work! They really need to hire someone to transcribe their podcasts for hard-of-hearing/hearing impaired individualsVox put out a good video on gun violence in the US that is worth watching: https://youtu.be/bX4qUsgHa4YYou're correct! Jon was also a co-creator of "1600 Penn" with Josh Gad, a show which was cancelled because of evil executives and not at all because of the alleged "low ratings" nonsense.**Synopsis**: DeRay, Brittany, Clint and Sam talk about this week’s news, including the deadly violence in Las Vegas. David Cole, national legal director of the ACLU, joins DeRay to share more about what the ACLU is doing to protecting civil rights through litigation, and Sarah Kate Ellis of GLAAD talks to DeRay about intersectionality and activism in the LGBTQ community.I would just note that, while Puerto Rico does have it's own political parties, the two largest do affiliate with the Democrats and Republicans federally. The PDP affiliate with the Dems and the PNP associate with the GOP. Love it thank you so much I knew it couldn't have been wholly correct, since Puerto Rico participates in presidential primaries.God, I hope so. He's so pleasant to listen to.Alyssa is getting her own pod!**Synopsis**: First, Tommy talks with Ben Rhodes about the mysterious attacks on our diplomats in Havana and the Trump administration’s decision to expel Cuban officials in response. Then, he’s joined by former Navy Secretary Ray Mabus to discuss his eight years leading the Navy as well as his time as the US Ambassador to Saudi Arabia.I'm trying to make a new theme for the subreddit based on the new website... Any CSS geniuses please pm me or the moderators!I'm hoping to get these merch during the live show to save on that ridiculous shipping cost... Unless anyone has a coupon code we can use?She actually did a poll on twitter based on the most used quotes from her show!

I forgot other options but I voted for the one about Jesus lol.Size guide is available on the merch page 

EDIT: why are y’all down voting me saying the size guide is available wtf I think that’s the design since the beginning. The words were placed on the chest area rather than upper abs/lower chest like regular graphic t shirtsSucking my Own Pod with The MoochI'm looking to overhaul the subreddit theme to make it more bold and crisp, similar to the website. Let me know if that will be complicated or costly!That's okay if you're busy haha. I'd love to change at least the title and make it reflect the new logo before anything else but I think I can do that. Let me know what your regular rates are!THANK YOU SO MUCH! I am fidgeting about with these color settings and hopefully pop something remotely decent out!Thanks! I will definitely let you know haha feel free to run the mentions but I think we are going to be skewed thanks to that Hillary interview...Sent you an invite for config and wiki permissions! That gives you permission to edit side bar, images, css, and auto moderator settings.Yeah but I forgot the icons in this specific theme is white, so having a white background means we can't see the icons lolIt’s sarcasm haha Haha with the risk of people saying I’m breaking the rule of “personal attack”, I’ll just suggest you to look at their comments in other parts of the subreddit and make up your own mind about that :)According to her twitter bio, she’s getting a new Pod. I’m not sure if it’ll be with CM or not thoughHahaha I’m excited about the beer glasses set. Very good holiday gift too.I love their writings and Lovett's echoed his speech on the pod the other day. Very effective I can't wait for CM to become more than a podcast company!I honestly don't see how he can. His highest level of office is Missouri SoS. That's not going to cut it, especially with the high-profile crew that will be itching to get in.

(And Donald Trump shouldn't be used as an example of "You don't need political experience". We're not lowering the bar like that.)He went to Berkeley. Of course.This is so good you should tweet it to them Now I’m convinced that many of the contributors will join the tour haha**Synopsis**: Crooked Conversations brings the same no-BS, conversational approach that made Pod Save America a hit to subjects that aren’t making headlines but have an major impact on our lives. We’ll cover topics like money in politics, the lasting damage done by the war on drugs, and the impact of Black Panther inside and outside the Marvel universe.Okay I'm hella HELLA excited.Okay Cash App doesn't support payments they only do transfers lolCash App doesn’t have an option where stores can accept it as a payment method, is there?You’re telling me a store can use Cash App to accept money for orders? You’re talking about paying with Cash App, I’m talking about ACCEPTING money for online orders.

If you’re selling me a t shirt, how do you accept money from cash App like you would accept money using PayPal?That’s not the issue. OP is saying the site isn’t using Cash App to receive payment, not making payments using cash App.But they "accept" paypal without the need of charging a visa or something. That was my point.1) Awesome that Keith Ellison wrote for the site. Shouts to Isaiah Breen and that whole comms team.

2) This underlines the most important reality of the Trump era, and one that I think some in Crooked world can sometimes gloss over: the most dangerous parts of Donald Trump are the things that make him exactly like a typical Republican. Cutting taxes on the wealthy to fund massive spending cuts or even to blow-up the deficit so the GOP can justify deep Medicaid cuts down the road will hurt only the poor and vulnerable.

3) I want to get a tattoo of this: "Politicians who aren’t arguing in good faith don’t respond to arguments, they respond to power."
And, it was light hearted and not really in need of a debate.  
They always say ‘we do t use the other app anymore’Anyone who wants to meet up before the Cleveland show let me know. **Synopsis**: First, Sam Sinyangwe joins us to talk about how media coverage of the Las Vegas massacre largely ignored America’s long history of mass shootings, including the deadliest mass shooting ever, perpetrated by white supremacists. You can read Sam’s tweets about the topic [here](https://twitter.com/samswey/status/914963280501858304). We also discuss why gun control policies need to be conscious of race and racism, and why mixing sports and politics continues to be a good thing.

Next, regular friend and ally of the pod Rick Wilson is back to point out the irony in the Right not being more alarmed by Trump’s expansion of federal power — in particular ICE and Homeland Security. We also discuss voting rights and Rick responds to a listener seeking advice on how to have productive conversations with conservatives about gun control in the wake of Vegas. Rick and Ana try and don't entirely fail in modeling that conversation.

TEXTURE: Get a 14 day free trial when you go to texture.com/FRIENDS**Synopsis**: Erin Ryan, Randy "Iron Stache" Bryce, and Rep. Chris Taylor join Jon, Jon, Tommy, and Dan in Madison, Wisconsin to talk about gun safety, Tillerson calling Trump a moron, not draining the swamp, and much more. Does primary concerns still update? It stopped updating months ago on my phone, I figured they didn't make it anymore...Ownership of assault rifles is stupid. Opposing sensible gun control legislation is retarded. Crazy centrists!&gt; Yep. Calling people names that slur their mental condition when you're using a moral argument is definitely sound logic.

You're gonna have to get used to people using words in ways you don't like, because that's the way the world is. Tough break. The two issues are not logically connected at all.

&gt;they didn't actually propose their opinion on what constitutes sensible gun legislation.

That doesn't invalidate their opinion, and that's also not their job, they aren't representatives. They're in media. Their job is to put a spotlight on the conversation and share their views.

&gt;This fucking segment was basically Rush Limbaughesque 

I honestly think that is a stupid opinion. Sorry.&gt;Literally defending name calling because it's on your side, but every time they talk about Trump's name calling it's suddenly bad.

You can't be serious.Haven’t listened yet but according to some people who went last night, several questions during Q&amp;A were either offensive or ignorant. I don’t doubt they cut those off.Whoops you’re gonna hate the new theme then :(Yeah it seemed like that guy's point was if we just denounce Trump with bigger and louder words, then people will.....finally agree with us? I dunno.

It also seemed that he was fishing for applause for saying the thing that everyone is the room already agreed with.I’m really loving the dynamic of the four hosts together. Sometimes the energy on the Thursday pod feels kind of low and not as enjoyable as the Monday pod since I guess it’s just Jonand Dan, but Dan actually vibes really well with the other three. Honestly I’d be ok if they continue with some episodes having the four of them even after the tour is done.  Think Dan’s schedule was the biggest issue to work out but me too I hope they get to do these shows more often They sell merch at the live show but there is a size guide on the merch website if you wanna find out your sizeIt's such a small mug though! I need at least 20oz.Actually my good bot, I believe in this case it is 14 fluid ounces, not regular ounces. Good try though.You are such a typical oblivious liberal. Quit cultural dog whistling your centrism so loud! It's offensive and shaming to those who would like to shoot other people with automatic weapons that aren't technically assault rifles in peace! Want to hear some god damn statistics? 

**/s**I've been a fan of Erin since she went on Chapo, but I'm glad she re-oriented herself toward PSA because listening to Chapo makes me feel dirty. I'm actually more ideologically aligned with Chapo, but:

A. The main hypocritical dudes who benefit greatly from being upper middle class white guys (one of their dads was an effing New Yorker editor) while espousing occasionally sexist or racist viewpoints and embracing an ideology which is inherently not intersectional. The Chapo subreddit is a place where people who would have Pepe tattoos if not for having read Das Kapital at age 16 talk about how neonazis are "victims of capitalism we need to reach out to" while posting memes about Hillary being a bitch. 

B. They are overly hostile to the Democratic Party, the only available instrument of change in the country, and are caught up in the typical ideological purity games of the left. Even the DSA, which they encourage people to join, understands that the only path for socialism in the US is via supporting the Democratic Party... instead, Chapo just gets caught up in their purity test politics insulting Elizabeth Warren and even Bernie Sanders for not being pure enough. 

C. It is utterly absurd to use "bend the knee" rhetoric, even removing the claims that it was sexist which it was not, when you have never won an election for anything. Populism is inherently neither good or bad and can be both, the association of it with fascism is shortsighted and too easily maligns an entire movement based on a few instances. 

I would say, for example, that the Scottish National Party in Scotland is populist and that has produced a stronger social safety net than exists in the rest of the UK. Populism mixed with blood and soil nationalism is where things get sketchy. I consider myself an [anarchist-communist](http://thebreadbook.org/) of the "smash the state, eat the rich" type, so I don't mind the idea of different perspectives, but I find Chapo, in particular, really tiresome. First, in spite of them having real comedy chops, it seems like 90% of their humor is "get a load of this asshole" style, and often times really "internety" in a way that I find really grating. Stuff like [this](https://i.redd.it/9pr5oog9d7qz.png), (which I know is not them, but is representative of a lot of their humor) can be funny in the second-long, internet humor picture format, but can get *really* tiring in an hour+ long podcast.

And a lot of it is just really mean spirited. I get that they call themselves "the dirtbag left", bt it is the equivalent of people who say "yeah, I'm as asshole, and I *speak my mind*" which, if you have ever met one of them, is the *worst type of person*. So to be clear, my main problem with them is in their capacity as entertainers.

That said, though, I find their particular political stance really grating. It is the sort of "capitalism is the problem, half measures will do nothing, it needs to be torn out root and branch, so vote Bernie Sanders!" style of socialism that is just worst of both words. I like EndNotes and Gilles Dauve and the like so it is not as though I mind critiques of parliamentarian activism or anything, but with Chapo it also seems like more of a political hipsterdom than a genuine critique of capital.**Synopsis**: Rexy gets caught telling the truth. The country once again debates gun violence. Trump heads to Puerto Rico. The "Iron Stache" Randy Bryce talks Paul Ryan. Congressman Mark Pocan talks monopolies. Erin Gloria Ryan tests Jon on Wisconsin trivia. Plus comedians Felonious Munk and Brandon Wardell join Jon to break down the week. Recorded live in Madison, Wisconsin!You could probably write a bot that auto posts all of these threads when they are released. Hell, maybe I could do it.Lol we’re looking into that. We didn’t think we’d get over 5k subs so quicklyThis is a stupid argument. The 2nd amendment has nothing to do with shooting as a sport, nor does it consider guns to be tools like a kitchen knife (that's an extreme false equivalency). The 2nd amendment is explicitly about guns as weapons of war. 

Here is the full text of the 2nd amendment: 

&gt;"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."English law is irrelevant, we are discussing the United States of America. I encourage you to read more discussion from the founding fathers themselves. You will notice hunting and sport are never mentioned once, because they have nothing to do with the right to bear arms.

Here is a distillation of many of these original sources:
http://www.guncite.com/gc2ndpur.htmlBy the way dude I have to say I think it's really funny that I quoted the second amendment verbatim and you said it wasn't based in historical fact. Just...lol...It doesn't matter that the English Bill of Rights influenced the US Bill of Rights, what matters are the rights that are actually enshrined. You can't just assume that all rights in the English Bill of Rights are holdovers, or that there is some preconceived notion about rights that were never discussed but still applicable. That makes no sense. It's a completely different country, and the rights enshrined thereof are their own with their own logic. Frankly, with a response like that I don't think we understand each other at all and will have to agree to disagree.

&gt;the need for a militia, membership in any militia, let alone a well-regulated one, was not intended to serve as a prerequisite for exercising the right to keep arms.

This has to do with the difference between an individual right and a collective right to bear arms for self defense against tyranny. Nothing to do with sport or hunting.

Your source doesn't have anything to do with the second amendment, it just talks about how the founding fathers liked sport. So...okay? Who cares.

&gt;it seemed ridiculous to them that they would have to enshrine hunting as a protected reason to own a gun.

The fact is that it isn't. That is what I have been getting at. I'm done arguing so we'll have to disagree.Honestly, decent episode but pretty skipable if you listened to PSA which had Randy Bryce and Erin Ryan on it.  It felt like a repeat.  When he says that though, usually it's with the context that Washington has *changed* Paul Ryan. I think that's his attempt at changing some minds. This comment needs to be higherTo be fair, front rows mean VIPs who gets on site concierge aka drinks brought to them hahahaThe panelist was on his phone?Wow that is totally bizarre, I can't imagine someone bringing a book onstage and reading the whole time they're supposed to be a panelist on a live comedy show. It really shouldn't be socially acceptable to do stuff like that. I guess a lot of people are incredibly addicted to their phones...What actually happens during the break? Is it just a 3 minute interlude where everyone takes a breather or is there still crowd interaction but it’s just not put in the episode? Just curious. These people were not willing to spend the money to get the VIP to talk to the guys before the show so they think they can become personal friends with them during a 2-minute Q&amp;A session. I hope the Q&amp;A debacles die down a little once we're in DC and California...This so fucking much. Can't remember the pod, but the one dude that just wanted to see how many sophisticated sounding insults he could hurl about trump was the worst. I don't even think he had a question.  
  
Also, they probably edit the q&amp;a's so how bad are the q's that get cut?I remember that guy.  He was so trying to be Lovett.  Yes, just t shirts and coozies though.  No coffee mugs or anything like that.  I mean I’ve heard him on shows before and have had the exact same complaints when he’s on those. I’ve given him a chance, and it’s the same bullshit every time. He only opposes Trump on issues of tact, hell he was in charge of oppo research for Jeb. Fuck this guy. I don’t need to like him because he’s against Trump. He’s still against regulation and women’s health care and health care in general. Emphasis mine on all of these passages from the article.

“Thanks to legal and congressional and political restraints on Trump’s worst impulses, though, many of the policy changes he has delivered to date are **rather appealing from the perspective of anti-Trump Republicans like me: Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch; a rollback of the regulatory state;** Russian sanctions.”

“One might naturally wonder, then, why I have placed myself in league with an assortment of socialists and snowflakes and cloyingly earnest liberal podcast hosts”

“For many readers, **those goals will be single-payer health insurance and unrestricted abortion. I, on the other hand, hope you never get those things!**”

He seems pretty loud and proud about being awful in these excerpts. And as callous and awful as this sounds, it really isn’t the responsibility of me or anyone else on the left to temper our criticism of views like these to keep people who held them in the recent past. I’m glad that you personally have seen the light, but any instant pangs of guilt you get when republicans are insulted is a dissonance you have to work through. I expect him to not be hired by an ostensibly liberal activist organization? Is it too much to ask that they don’t hire any overtly anti-choice people to write for them?Do you really think the best way to ingratiate yourselves with a group is by repeatedly mocking them? Especially by co-opting language that has been used by the right to dismiss them and their concerns for years now. He’s said it more than once on their shows and gone on rants about it. And disagrees with their points. I don’t know what more you need from him. One of the hosts? No. But he’s mocked socialists before, and the extent to which you find it a joke or not is debatable. But I think excusing people’s opinions because they’re being charming and funny while they say it is part of why we have Trump now. People thought he was joking and didn’t take what he said at face value. He told us exactly what he felt and wanted to do, but nobody believed him. Believing what people say at face value is a lesson we should be taking from this year

And if you want to hear the interview I’m talking about, it was on the 7/13 PSA episode. I’m not comparing what he said to what Trump has said—I’m comparing the reactions. We can’t excuse what someone says because it’s a joke. If he jokes about being anti-choice and disliking socialists, we have to assume that’s the case. Just like you assume someone is racist for making racist jokes. That’s fair. My point is that I’ve heard enough and I think he’s, at best, a shitty ally. And at worst, someone who should be actively opposed. **Synopsis**: Senator Sherrod Brown and Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Connie Schultz join Jon, Jon, Tommy, and Dan in Cleveland, where the crew talks Trump's North Korea tweets, the Harvey Weinstein scandal, Bob Corker's newfound freedom, and how Democrats can win in Ohio.I feel like they'd get into some random ass topics and it would be pretty funny hahaI haven't listened to him other than the Bill Simmons Podcast. Do you like him? Oh shit I didn't. I have to catch up lolI’m wondering about that too. Ana had so much good stuff to say from what I heardI think the majority of people who voted for her did so out of obligation rather than “excitement” if I could assert my assumption. I think excitement and turnout are separate issues? I don’t know I’m not an analyst, Just my two cents.I personally was excited about Clinton but the circles around me are less so than the excitement around Obama.I’m not saying there weren’t people who felt obligated to vote for Dems before, I’m just saying it appears that there are more of those this time around than before. You said it yourself that a variety of reasons could have caused less excitement for Clinton lol.They posted a video clip from one of those shows on the Crooked Media twitter so that’d lead me to believe it’ll get posted. Seems a waste of it doesn’t. I have a feeling they may have screened them this time. Dan being part of the other three’s dynamic makes me happy. I like Joe a lot but I don’t know how good that would be. He never seems to have trouble getting along with someone if they have a different view or opinion to him but if someone has a very different personality sometimes the episode gets awkward imo. Like when he had Pete Holmes on. 

Also there’d be inevitable political discussion and it might get messy. Though Joe has shown with many guests that he is actually much more liberal leaning than right. He flows well with most guests I feel. I'm not familiar, do you have a link?I never even notice it in a distracting way tbh. I did notice that we can generally hear everyone’s breathing and light laughing/coughing because at least two or three of them were using those headset mics, so they couldn’t hold the mic away to do those things. Also could hear some hushed discussion that’d typically be off mic at a few points in the episode because of those headset mics being used which was a bit awkward. audible.com/world from Pod Save the World**Synopsis**: DeRay, Clint, Brittany and Sam talk about Indigenous Peoples Day, restoring prisoner rights in Florida, and more. Dr. Henry Louis Gates joins to explore race, oppression and anthropology through geneology, and Chef Sean Sherman joins to talk about pre-colonial cooking and indigenous nutrition.A lot of the sounds you hear are them drinking beers. It made for a fun atmosphere live, though I noticed on the Pod it's annoying. Nope, they just walked up to the mic. We were all invited, that's just who went up. I think that if we ever want to win Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin or Michigan again we need to make peace with some people. Maybe they're compiling a few of the interviews to be an episode for next week. Alright, so I just got around to reading it. Overall I would say that the Buzfeed article does no really go iinto Bannon but makes sense with my conception of Breitbart and with Green's book. What Green presents is very much the finished product, the "scrubbed clean" version that the Buzzfeed article shows being the product of Yiannopolis&amp;Pals massaging the far right sources. In one pretty egregious example, when he first mentions the alt-right he describes it as a heterogeneous collection of views that are right of center but excluding the mainstream GOP, but that Clinton's team in a clever bit of messaging  defined it as white supremacist. This is *completely absurd*, the term was popularized (maybe invented?) by Richard Spencer, but it is the view that Yiannopolis crafted in his Breitbart article, and the Buzzfeed article goes into how deliberate that crafting was.

By and large, when Green focuses on ideological precursors he goes back to the anti-Clinton operatives of the 1990s. This is definitely an important part of the story of Bannon and I am not faulting Green for mentioning it, but it is also very *safe*. Clinton is not a particularly popular figure right now and targeted hit jobs are an acceptable part of our political discourse in a way that out-and-out racial supremacy is not. Whether Green's failure to give a really critical account of the racial elements of Breitbart and Bannon is a result of a research failure or a strategic choice is an open question, although obviously I suspect the latter.

One note:

&gt;“I need to go thru this tomorrow in depth…although I do appreciate any piece that mentions evola,” Bannon wrote.

This is something I wanted to talk about in the main post but did not because of lack of space. Green does have a short section on Bannon's ideology, and he focuses on Guenon and the Traditionalist School, which is one of the things which is like *come the fuck on*. Nobody gives a shit about the Traditionalists except the connection to Evola, and nobody cares about Evola unless they are reading about fascism. Being a follower of Guenon is a "safe" way to be a follower of Evola. It is fascism in a fancy suit.I completely agree. It looks like they record the taping anyway because most of the clips from Facebook showed them in studio recording lol.Don't you know that the Constitution is now considered an opinion? That's why it no longer binds the actions of our president lol

/sIt’s cuz he had to do two shows Thursday night in Wisconsin, two shows Friday night in Ann Arbor, fly back to LA on Saturday to do this show, fly back to Ohio for a show on Sunday and one show in Chicago yesterday lol.**Synopsis**: Bonus ep! Rob Huebel, Taz Ahmed, and Felix Biederman join Jon at LA Podfest to talk Trump's revised travel ban, immigration, and DOJ's trans ruling. Plus a dramatic reading by Rob and "Too Stupid to be True" on birth control. Good.

**EDIT**: mentioning McEwen is not targeted harassment, but spreading false info is. So the comment falsely saying McEwen was sexually assaulted by Biederman was removed.Man, tell me about it. I was pretty shocked by how militant and well spoken this guy was for how absolutely wrong he was. 

His argument is basically *"British people founded the USA and they liked to shoot stuff back in the day, so everyone knows we now have that right too!"*

It's a pretty fundamental misunderstanding of the issue.TIL New York rent and food cost almost 15k a month lmaoDo you remember which section they mentioned the website? I can look for it**Synopsis**: Tommy and Eliot Cohen, a counselor to Condoleezza Rice during the Bush administration, talks about his Atlantic piece “How Trump is Ending the American Era” and try to figure out what constitutes a Republican and Democratic foreign policy worldview in 2017.**Synopsis**: Corker tells the New York Times that Trump is a dangerous liar, Stephen Miller sabotages the DREAMer deal, and social media platforms wrestle with fake news. Then Tommy and Dan talk about gun violence with the founder of Mothers/Men Against Senseless Killings, Tamar Manasseh, as well as the director of the University of Chicago Crime Lab, Jens Ludwig. Plus, Ok Stop![Manataka](http://www.manataka.org/index.html?no_redirect=true)Me too! They still haven't released the two live shows from Ann Arbor! I was busy refreshing PSA today and forgot about PSTW but the discussion for both are up!They literally cut most of what he said out of this podcast. It's bullshit.Daily reminder: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CxqVzcnXUAEsj16.jpgThey cut almost the entirety of what Felix said during the podcast, which is why he isn't in it much. This is utter bullshit.Is this what liberals mean by "listening to different perspectives"? Have a socialist on the podcast and cut most of his statements out, but have a neocon on the podcast and let him blather on about how we need to bomb more third-world countries?Huh? I don’t get you people. If you hate us so much, don’t listen to it! One of you called us “sentient shitstains” and instead of shutting the hell up, they decided to shitpost instead? What kind of sense does it make?DT waged war on television networks today. We have plenty to discuss haha.It's just funny to me because of all the fucking sanctimony. Liberals loooove to say that they like to get different perspectives from different people, but when they hear from someone to the left of them, they either freak out or just try to erase them. This is the latter.&gt; sanctimony

Try that again. Chapo Bros think that they are so much better than us “sentient shitstains” yet are the most devout listeners to our shows. What do you call that?

Let me give you a hint, it’s right there in your comment.Nothing wrong with having Republicans come on and insult socialists and advocate for anti-choice and Gorsuch, though!Also there was almost definitely a giant chunk missing from Dave Anthony’s appearance, where they discuss the difference between a “sanctuary city” and a “city of sanctuary”. Anthony mentioned that discussion during his episode of Left Coast. And I relistened to the Lovett episode and there’s no trace of it there. I'm very sorry that you got owned by a ruthless bernard brother, but you're missing the point: they invited someone on the podcast to get their perspective, and then they literally deleted that perspective because they could not handle it. What do you call that?It’s called editing? Bonus pods are usually shorter given that sponsors only pay for a certain amount of ads per week. The comments could have been edited due to time, audience reaction, or host/panel reaction. “They could not handle it” I’m sorry but were you there and a part of the editing decision?

He didn’t personally attack me or anything, but I’m just saying, for someone to cry sanctimony then do the same thing is extremely ironic.https://twitter.com/ByYourLogic/status/918159809035169793

Just because the audience or panel hates it doesn't mean that the audience does not deserve to hear it. Why even bother listening if you just want banal shit that confirms your views? 

The sponsor argument is horseshit. Do you really think that it costs them more to leave more content in a podcast? Where in this tweet did it say that it was removed due to “Lovett can’t handle it”? Audience reaction and panel reaction refers to the lack of participation or enthusiasm in discussion. Would you want to listen to one panelist ramble about something where there’s no engagement from the audience or other panelists?

I’m sorry, are you personally paying these panelists their respective appearance fees, plane tickets to LA Podfest, among other things? Still I want to reiterate: WHY LISTEN TO US IF ALL YOU DO IS CALL US NAMES AND HATE US FOR BEING SHITSTAINS?A very thoughtful and smart guy who advocates for endless war.To be fair, the best and most charitable interpretation of this article is that it’s entirely useless. And the worst is that Crooked media has skewed morals and doesn’t care that he’s being paid by them to advocate for anti-choice, deregulation, and other general conservative bullshit.

In no way is this article a good look for them. That only works if they’re debating him. I haven’t seen any of them mention this article yet. Normally that wouldn’t be such a big deal, but this was published within *days* of the 20 week abortion ban. Their listeners definitely deserve to hear “hey some of the stuff mentioned in this article is reprehensible and we don’t agree with it.”

Yeah, you can say that’s implied. But fuck that. Their followers deserve better. Please tell me what kind of debate is being sprung up by this article that isn't people going "why was this fucking scumbag paid to write this by people who worked for Obama"I'm really trying to discuss this with you in good faith here, and whenever I ask you an actual question or bring up a point, you change the subject. So I'll ask again. You say this could spur debate, great. What kind of debate? Have a stand, have an opinion, say *something*.
It's almost like me and other people have been saying that the article is, at best, pointless. Because what it's actually about has no target audience whatsoever. And the only parts of it worth discussing are his bullshit asides, which are heinous and not being discussed by his colleagues. It doesn't mention guns or taxes, it only mentions abortion. And it hasn't caused a debate, at least not with any of the main three guys at the company.
I'd love to hear what was cut out and what the panel's reaction to it was. That's way, way more interesting to me than just shit that confirms my views.Finally got through the Q&amp;A and everyone sounded drunk hahaSort of lol.Yeah, i know, but i want to HEAR it 😛Agreed. I'd start emailing him about it.If this is actually what it seems to be with what we know now, it’s extremely disappointing. Like... ugh. If you’re not confident enough in your beliefs and perspectives to allow an opposing view to have a platform on your product, then you are doing something wrong. Maybe it wasn’t Lovett himself but surely he would’ve known if lots of Felix was cut because of his views. Why? Not being argumentative just curious. I’ve been losing interest too. Love Dan but I keep getting pangs of second hand discomfort/anxiety when his jokes fall flat. I don’t know, probably bring overly sensitive to it but seemed like he didn’t gel quite as well in this one. There was a lot of crossover in the discussion with the last episode. Like a few points were repeated nearly word fo word. I guess it’s inevitable with having so many so close together but yeah I hope this means they’re editing the two shows together somehow?Tell that to the guy who claims to hate us unironically and say we’re sentient shitstains. Also tell that to the guy who sent me death threats over the Chapo thread being locked a few months back.Also the guys who want to shoot the PSA hosts? That may not be the majority, but they seem to be the most vocal ones.I have yet to see one FOTP to threaten to murder a Chapo broIt’s not going to be active if every time anything comes up we get an insurgent of Chapo Bros telling us we’re shitstainsWhen I went to a live LOLI he actually chatted with the audience about PunditSo let me get this straight, limiting a subreddit to discuss only relevant topics to the subreddit gives you excuses to call us shitstains?Spinning the conversation around to how awful some asshole fans are instead of actually discussing the points people from the farther left bring up won't help with thata) I listen to both shows and I post here more than I do on Chapo, so don't call it "my sub" to try and discredit me and act like I'm some invading asshole

b) look at the comment chain you're in. This started out talking about problems with establishment Democrats and how they treat the left, and you spun it into discussing how random asshole Chapo fans on twitter and reddit dislike the PSA guys. And how perfect and pure the PSA fans are. (Without anybody bringing up the power discrepancy between men who worked in the White House for 8 years and 5 politics nerds from Brookyln and the Midwest, btw)I've never seen any of these death threats, but it seems like you've gone from saying they're from Chapo fans, to alleging that the Chapo hosts said them, so which is it. And no either way. My point is that you will have so so so so so so many more Chapo fans discussing PSA than vice versa, due to the actual influence of PSA vs Chapo. So yeah, when there's a larger group, there tend to be much more assholes.I don't really think it's fair to say just "ignore what you dislike" when it's a discussion of politics. Especially, again, with people who have legitimate actual influence.

I could agree with you maybe if it was a podcast on a TV show or something. But I don't really see much of a distinction between "hate-listening and talking about it" and "understanding the viewpoints of others", which I've seen brought up like 25 times in the recent post I made here criticizing their involvement with Tim Miller. It's not really fair to say that you only want engagement with alternative viewpoints and ideas when you just want it done one-way.Yeah, fuck that dude. He got lots of blowback too, in the Chapo subreddit. I skimmed the thread that was calling him out and I don't think I saw anybody agreeing with him. They were just calling him an asshole.Its a running joke. They dont actually support Assad.Sometimes he talks too fast to hear what he is saying.We don't compromise amongst ourselves before we go negotiate with the Republicans.Apparently he was very tame compared to the stuff they usually say on Chapo.

There is such a thing censorship bleeps they could have used to clean up his speech if that was an issue. It certainly doesn't justify excising his statements wholesale from the podcast.They literally call for it. You don't listen to it if you think otherwise. Jesus Christ these comments are ridiculous. It's a fucking GAME SHOW, dude. It's not a piece of serious journalism like their other pods, and frankly, it wasn't even a great episode. Have you considered that the segments that were cut simply did not flow well or remained entertaining? I have to say I did not think the audience was as into it as usual so it's clear something was off. 

The idea that Lovett is some kind of shill and is silencing someone ON HIS OWN PANEL is utterly ridiculous. Lovett has personally tweeted support of Felix and brought attention to his work. 

https://mobile.twitter.com/jonlovett/status/867856175139704832

Quite frankly, he didn't have to have him on the show in the first place. You guys need to quit fucking bitching about something that doesn't even matter and is completely ludicrous on its face. 

And to all you Chapo people that are not friends of the pod, you can take your spiteful negativity and hate for everything and everyone around you and get the fuck out of our forum, because the flurry of insane baseless accusations and bad faith arguments I have seen from you here are enough to turn anyone off from ever agreeing with you or checking out Chapo content, which, although I'm not a huge fan, is a shame.Yes, they know his positions and had him on the show so clearly Lovett isn't trying to avoid publicizing his work or opinions. He's trying to make an entertaining episode of his own show. *Entertaining* being the key word.

Like I said, 

&gt;Have you considered that the segments that were cut simply did not flow well or remained entertaining? I have to say I did not think the audience was as into it as usual so it's clear something was off.&gt;I would absolutely disagree with the idea that it can't or shouldn't sometimes be a vehicle for substantive discussions.

This is completely up to Lovett and the Crooked team. I think they  leave in things that work and cut things that don't, like any other project. It's that simple. I don't disagree that it can be a great vehicle for substantive discussion, but I think this podcast in particular is focused on humor and entertainment as a gateway to activism, not as a journalistic enterprise.

&gt;I think it's fair to at least ask why large portions of (according to Felix) discussion of contentious areas was cut.

I agree, I think that is a fair question. A lot of people here aren't asking that, but instead answering the question themselves with baseless assumptions that Lovett was somehow engaged in some kind of political censorship, and then using that to bash us as a community and "liberals" in general. (lolwut?) 

We have no idea what the context was, or possible other motives, or even how much was really cut, and the conspiracy angle really doesn't make a lot of sense given that it was his own invited guest. In addition to all of that, the stakes in this case are incredibly low all around. This issue doesn't matter at all. It's a stupid discussion we are all having here, and the outrage is completely manufactured.I keep hearing this sentiment lately and I do agree the idea of that is really off putting and disappointing but I don’t know where people are getting it - who have they had on that’s used the platform to express these opinions?lol you got me, AMA.Pundit is an **angel!!**This is it. We found it. The perfect liberalism.txtYou're missing the point. They have these panel discussions ostensibly so that they can get differing points of view and provide an interesting discussion. If they censor the statements that conflict with the panel or the audience, then it just becomes a circlejerk. Do you really think that's interesting or insightful? Do you really want to just hear your opinion yelled back to you in an earnest way so that you can applaud it?Tim Miller. His new article is full of snide jabs at socialists and anti-choice. We know better. We will move the game away from you until you have no choice but to follow.You should be rejoicing at the thought of a left wing tea party, because that means the democrats actually have a shot at taking back congress next yeat.They just said the Stabenow section will be on today's pod.Why do you think that we dont want to engage with you? Could it be that you guys routinely attempt to shut us down every single time, censor our thoughts, marginalize our voices every single time we try to be heard? You call us worse than trump supporters; how could we think of you as someone that we could work with when you pull that shit?

We've tried the discourse. It has repeatedly failed us. We will be making our voices heard on our own terms, not yours.We're in the middle of a struggle session about it right now. We can actually take criticism of our faves and want them to do better.&gt;There's just so much going on right now!!!

I see what you did there!there's a gigantic thread about how what they said is problematic and they need to address it, and I and many others will agitate to let them know that what they said was not fucking acceptable and they need to do better. It's certainly not "most of the sub", thats disingenuous. Despite what you may think, we take care of our comrades.As a Michigander, I am of course very interested in our governor's race.

It's tough, because I like both Abdul El-Sayed an Gretchen Whitmer a lot. Like, I'd be great with either of them. Whitmer is the frontrunner and she impressed me when she got up in the state senate and voiced opposition to an anti-abortion-coverage bill by admitting (for the first time ever) that she had been raped in college and that the bill would have prevented her from having coverage for an abortion if she had gotten pregnant. That took guts.

On the other hand, El-Sayed is an exciting choice for multiple reasons. I do shudder at the thought of the anti-Muslim rhetoric and ads we'd be inundated with if he were nominated. But I would hope his intelligence and affability would break through the noise.

Got a long time to decide. As long as either of them win, I'm good.I honestly don't know. We've seen how easily certain people have fallen for idiotic "sharia law" fake news, and we have a very big evangelical population in the west part of the state. Dearborn, however, is the largest concentration of Muslims in the western hemisphere.

It does worry me that it would turn off moderate voters who are very religious, plus it would probably help drive money towards the Republican (almost certainly Attorney General Bill Schuette). As I said, his personal charisma could be enough to offset it, as well as his status as a doctor.It's ok dude we talked about gun violence 2 days ago so we're all good, no need to anymore

/s

This is a great article.It's not on the levelI didn’t really know anything about Senator Gillibrand before listening to this, but I like her a lot. She has a real investment in the issues she focuses on and seems fully dedicated to her job and constituents and a very non-Fake way. She really catapulted up in a big way. I spent a lot of time in northern NYS and her "pivot" or whatever on gun control is so genuine and right on point. Guns up there are tools and recreation, and it's genuinely difficult to appreciate the urban perspective for people in that culture. I think he knew what he wanted to say but was very conscious of the panelists he was with and the audience he was addressing (as he should have been) so struggled with how to say it. I think he just wanted to honestly express that when he was younger he was probably crass and too forthcoming and possibly disrespectful of women, and this scandal made him reflect on that seriously. It could be the case that he just didn’t want to state past mistakes like that bluntly. I respect what he was trying to say, and I think he was just trying to offer another perspective to the one the others were offering, rather than not addressing the victim specifically because he thinks it’s somehow less important. I liked Neal on this a lot, hope he comes back in future. I know he’s friends with Jon so I’d say it’s likely. I hadn’t realised before now that he was so left leaning due to his personality and the kinds of interviews he’d give I guess but it’s cool to see him get involved in the discussions from that perspective. Lovett rarely gets in my nerves but his rant about the Eminem thing kind of annoyed me. He seems like he’s missing the point. It’s crass and if you wrote it down and just read it off a page anyone would think it’s trash. But this is one of the most successful musicians of all time, with a fanbase that undoubtedly contains many of the younger right wingers who are now all in on the Trump camp, many of whom would’ve grown up with Eminem’s early albums. The point was the seemingly very genuine emotion and frustration in his delivery. I’ve seen plenty of phones in performances from artists who are long past having made it to the top, but there was a fire in his Trump rap/rant that was very present. It’s not even a good ‘rap’, and it’s goofy as hell, but again, that’s not the point, and I feel like Lovett was judging it like it was the point. 

Eminem sent a very serious message that any fans of his who support Trump do not have his endorsement or appreciation, and as one o the panelists said that is much more than many others have done. The Macklemore comment was brilliant. For sure. I felt like he was rating Eminem's freestyle on a scale of writing in general, I think he said "it's just a bad poem said angrily". Which is obviously kind of the wrong way to look at it and the main reason I was put out by his rant. He has a fantastic podcast voice. The one a couple weeks ago with the reporter who interviewed Gotti and bin Laden was great.

All Crooked Media fans should check out "Stay Tuned, with Preet". In his first episode he described the series of events that led to Trump firing him.Dan used to Skype in on Keepin it 1600 and it sounded nearly perfect. Don’t know why they can’t just organise for all their guests to Skype in. I wish The Daily dropped earlier...I start work at 7am ETIt's not necessarily the medium that matters, it's the equipment. Skype over a good mic will sound perfect. Skype over a bad mic will be hard to understand at all. Dan has a good mic because he is a podcaster. Commentators that call in will use their own shitty equipment (cell phone, laptop, etc.) and so they sound shitty. There's nothing Crooked Media or anyone for that matter can do about it on the back end. This problem happens all the time in all forms of media, even cable news. You can't just fedex every contributor that can't be in the studio a nice microphone and sound interface so that they sound good. People call in using their own shitty equipment.Ah, I see what you're saying. My guess is that is too technical/time consuming for guests, who are already volunteering to be on the show. 

&gt;"in-quality" within journalism frequently refers to using a smartphone

I work in audio and I have never heard this term. Google doesn't know it either. Where did you hear this?I get the idea that politics ends "at the water's edge", but I think the concept is a  bite trite. Especially when Democrats are beaten over the head as soft on terrorism and global threats. 

It's just worth noting that two of the last five PSTW episodes feature current GOP congressmen. Will Hurd is a top DCCC target in 2018, and Kinzinger is in a single-digit R+ district in Illinois.

I am a foreign policy voter before anything, and hawkish neocons aren't particularly appealing. There's an entire world of advocates for peace, nuclear disarmament advocates, journalists, etc. that can articulate a left-wing vision for American foreign policy. I'd like to see Tommy engage in that discussion more than just occasionally. I like to hear opposing viewpoints, and Ben seems to represent the other side's arguments pretty well.PSA, PSW, Lovett

Stay tuned with preet bharara

538 politics


Politico nerdcast


Slate political gabfest


Candidate confessional


New Yorker radio hour


Ezra Klein show

I listen to way too many to list (desk job, etc.). Some in the political/social category I will mention:

The Axe Files- David Axelrod's 'cast interviewing people in the political and journalistic world. He will talk to people of all stripes, but I will generally look at the description to see if I'm interested in it. Typically biographical, with the token "what do you make of Trump?" I like to listen to the ones of senators or governors so I can get to know them better when they're in the news. Jon Favreau has been on, though it was a while ago so you have to scroll a ways back.

Slate's Political Gabfest- Another political discussion. It's in-depth, but still light enough that it's not homework. Fairly balanced, and David Plotz has occasional opposing opinions that are far enough out there to be interesting, but not far enough away that it's a turn-off. 

Stay Tuned- Preet Bharara's podcast. It's great!

Sleepover- This is a "seasonal" series hosted by Canadian broadcaster Sook Yin Lee. She takes three random people (usually of different demographics or backgrounds) and they spend the night in a hotel room or some secluded place and discuss what's been troubling them and see if they can solve each other's problems. Three episodes per sleepover. The group ranges from children to LGBT people to conservative older people to Jagmeet Singh, the man who is now the leader of the New Democratic Party. There have so far been two seasons containing a few sleepovers each, as well as follow-ups. I've seen some people criticize it for being too introspective and "me"-focused, but if you are interested in diverse people interacting, it's worth a listen.

Not exactly political but I have to mention The Tobolowsky Files. Best podcast ever. Tobolowsky is an actor (Ned Ryerson! Bing!), and he tells true stories from his life - from acting to childhood adventures to relationships. He's an excellent storyteller, combining humor and philosophy. While it's not chronological, there still tends to be through-lines and story arcs so it has to be listened to in order. It's been very infrequent since 2013 or so, but this spring he came out with 12 in a row, and I think he might do that again. It's just a delight. I can give people good ones to start with if they want to see if it's for them.Never Not Funny is my favorite. It's not for everyone, but I just enjoy the chemistry and the shoot-the-shit format.I absolutely listen to JJGo.How could I forget to put Worldly in my list? I love that podcast. Thanks for your suggestions.Shout out to Jenny and Kristin!Scrolled through, some I listen to but didn't see:  
* Revisionist History (adding detail to misunderstood/lesser known history)  
* The Allusionist (about language/words)  
* The Memory Palace (one dude telling short stories beautifully)  
* Gimlet's: Uncivil (civil war), Science Vs. (self explanatory), Start Up (start up companies), Every Little Thing (in depth unique science related stories), Crimetown (nonfiction, mob stories), The Pitch (shark tank in pod form)  
* Us and Them (stories from across cultural divides)  
* Locked up abroad (non fiction, different story each ep)  
* Rough Translation (stories from outside the US that relate to issues in the US)  
* Piece of Work (talks art in the least pretentious way with a comedian host)  
* What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law (best pod host with a con law professor talking issues trump brings about)  
* Twenty Thousand Hertz (about sounds)  
* SciFri and Undiscovered (more science)  
* Hidden Brain (psychology with shankar)  
* How I Built this (founders of known companies interviewed by Guy)Pretty sure this is the first time Crooked Media has broken a news story. With Beutler on staff, I'd be surprised if it was the last.I listened to that for awhile, but found it started getting way too removed from policy and too sensationalist.Yep - I always look forward to Thursdays for all the podcasts, especially for the Gabfest, being my favorite (sorry PSA).Heh, it went up within a minute of this post.I don't know about the sentence, but it would freak out conservatives and cause them to scream about deep states, antifa, Soviet-like control of communications, and probably Hillary for good measure. 

My point: you don't gain ground by using blunt force. You do it by being a person.Brought to you by ProFlowers™®Dan Pfeiffer said it was six years ago. So 2011.One thing that happened in the Swecker chat that always irks me when I see others do it.

She spent a lot of time talking about Ralph being a veteran and a doctor and an all-around nice guy. But almost nothing on what he would DO as governor. What sets him apart from Ed Gillespie? As they are from different parties, I can reasonably assume many things, but for the independent voter who doesn't know much about politics, this does not make the case.

"Welcome.....to Harassment Park."We don't use the other apps anymore. We have troops all over the world, and this is prime Boko Haram territory. The real question is, how were they ambushed, why did they leave Sgt. Johnson behind (possibly even still alive), and why did it take two whole days to retrieve him?&gt; Murkowski and Collins didn't stand against the bill on moral grounds: Their constituents would have suffered under the bill.

Voting based on the welfare of their constituents isn't moral?Man, that's a pretty impressive list.  The guys are racking 'em up.  There was the "hot mic" moment where Collins and Jack Reed talked about Trump being incompetent and that rep. who challenged her to a duel, whom she made fun of. Could be a fun thing to talk about.“The other option is to wake up in a not-too-distant future, in a party dominated by racists and reactionaries and red hats, and retire to the suburbs wondering how we got here.”

By not-too-distant future, does he mean last year?Of course they are complicit, this piece is not trying to defend the actions of Republicans, in fact he is quite openly derisive towards them. I don't think he believes the party can be fully separated from Trump, either. At least not in the immediate future. That's not what this piece is about.

This piece is arguing that there is true power in resistance that is going untapped on both sides. American politics are absolutely electric right now -- people are justifiably upset, tired of the bullshit system that has destroyed their economic well-being and future over the course of many years. This piece doesn't assign blame or fully predict an outcome, all it offers is a full throated advocation for a strong, surging resistance that is missing from both sides, and ESPECIALLY the Republicans, who have been nothing but spineless and helpless in the face of the faux-populist onslaught of our institutions and morals, preferring to play a safe hand -- which Miller argues is a fundamentally weaker political position in today's current climate.


From the article:

&gt;Trump is grotesque, but if there’s one positive lesson we can learn from him and his supporters it is this: To win, you have to fight. The implausible is possible. The tectonic plates beneath our politics are shifting constantly. 


&gt;That competition would require leaders to rally, and donors to support a cause they know is right against the odds, and a broad willingness within the [Republican] party to chip away slowly at the base of support for racial grievance politics masquerading as populism.This is a great piece. I think there are a lot of kneejerk reactions to Tim Miller on this sub because he represents the evil conservative bogeyman to some people. I don't agree with almost all of his political views but he's a very smart and articulate guy with a great sense of humor, and he has a lot of insight to offer to a conversation. I've enjoyed all of his contributions to Crooked. I think there is a lot of value in considering the content of an argument that comes from a different cultural and intellectual sphere. 

I don't believe media or politics are inherently an ideological bullhorn loudness war, even though the far right media operates that way. There is room for thought provoking discussion from both sides of the political spectrum. Crooked's inclusion of Tim as a contributor is not a heinous concession to give an undeserved platform to a conservative voice, as I have seen argued here in some other threads, and if anything that viewpoint is the epitome of Lovett's observation of the pervasive "culture of punditry" that clouds discourse. Nobody is going to vote Republican because they read a Crooked Media Tim Miller piece. Just something I've been thinking about.I enjoy wonk. Wonk this way, I say.I'm gonna paste part of a comment I made in another thread, because I'm a little tired of this bogus argument about an undeserved "platform."

I don't believe media or politics are inherently an ideological bullhorn loudness war, even though the far right media operates that way. There is room for thought provoking discussion from both sides of the political spectrum. Crooked's inclusion of Tim as a contributor is not a heinous concession to give an undeserved platform to a conservative voice, and that viewpoint is the epitome of Lovett's observation of the pervasive "culture of punditry" that clouds real discourse. This is really apparent when you say things like this:

&gt;doesn't mean **we** have to give Republicans of any stripe a platform.

I know you're referring to liberals in general, but in reality it's not **our** platform, it's Crooked's. They can do whatever they want with it. That kind of armchair macro politics and punditry gets in the way of, for example, having a reasonable discussion with someone like Tim Miller, which is a shame. Pretending conservatives don't exist is really dumb.

Nobody is going to vote Republican because they read a Crooked Media Tim Miller piece. Nobody is going to suddenly think the ACA is bad because Tim Miller said one thing about it on a PSA episode. That's ridiculous. He's not sullying the waters. He's adding to the conversation. On this pod specifically he spent nearly all of his time bashing Republicans.

You're free to disagree, but that's what I think anyway.He and Senator Heinrich did a Discovery Channel special living on a deserted island for a few days. Heinrich was stoic while Flake cracked most of the jokes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vjA8sDxDuQYeah, this one was my favorite in a while. I hope it represents a direction back towards more comedy.I see he finally brought the "what a week" bell back. I don't know why he doesn't ring it every time.I like to think they got it used. &gt;giving a platform to ideology reviled within the mainstream would be a huge albatross.

This is BS. His "future" in Washington has nothing to do with a single guest on his show.I love Favreau's interjections during Lovett's ad reading. It's exactly what Lovett does when Favreau is ad reading for PSA. These guys have too much fun!Yeah, I think he actually said verbatim that legislation is useless, heavily implying "black Africans" (what the fuck?) are all naturally violent and somehow subhuman. It's despicable. This was a great episode. Panels are hit and miss, some people are funnier than other people or end up having natural chemistry. 

There are also weeks where topics that aren't funny dominate the mainstream news. Talking about sexual violence for 20 minutes is really important but it's not funny at all, and it's been a big part of the news for nearly a month. Not as much room for silliness. Cracking jokes about Scaramucci a couple months ago=instant home runs.While I get what you are saying generally, I do think that in terms of this specific episode given that political news this week was dominated by the "never Trump resurgence" or whatever it made sense to have a never Trump on. Yeah, I was really hoping to hear Dan's take on it because he has a great way to explaining internal party politics.

That said, one possibility is that the story is a bit of a heap of nothing, I read something that said the "purging" element is pretty overblown and that the committee is not actually unbalanced. The fact that neither Ellison or Sanders or anyone other officials from that wing of the party have not said anything about it or really made any indication something is amiss does seem to show me that this does not really have much substance to it.

As a left-of-democrat myself, the left is not incapable of getting itself worked up over nothing. On the other hand, it often makes very pointed, useful and correct criticisms about the inertia within the party establishment and its tendency to be captured by special interests.At first I thought he wrote 'Kushner' on his jacket because he didn't have faith in his costume, but then you look back at [the original picture](https://i.amz.mshcdn.com/DHA3p_rmogHxt7pWIcbnSYgnfMw=/1200x627/https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fstory%2Fthumbnail%2F42099%2Fbb932933-f680-4f18-a9f0-a8d0f527a8ad.png) and Kushner *actually has duct tape with his name on it*.I basically agree with you, though I'm no expert on the subject. Basically it provides an opportunity for small states like Delaware, Wyoming, Alaska, etc. to have a voice. One of the perks of being your own state. Otherwise why would anyone give a shit about you? It was purposely designed to ensure progress was slow. Which is an annoying thing when Dems are trying to pass stuff, but a life-saver when GOP does, like right now.&gt; in a way it's designed

I think that is the issue. If we actually cared how it was designed, we would not allow any sort of direct election of Senators at all, it would be chosen by "the Legislature thereof". Unless you want to go to a system in which US Senators are chosen by state legislators, then there is no point in invoking "the way it was designed".

And I think that particular invocation gives rather more credit to the "founders" than is deserved. They were not in any respect interested in equitable solutions, but even if they were the actual history of expansion of the United states and the carving out of states thereof is not divinely ordained or even built in any real principle. That Wyoming has as much say in the upper house of the US congress is not divinely ordained or even really based on any rational principle, and to simply write it off as intrinsic to national design is, at least, somewhat lazy, and really somewhat dangerous.

Maybe proportional representation is not what the Founders intended but, you know, fuck 'em.State border are not natural or inherent, they are accidents of history. Saying that someone's vote should count for more in the upper house of congress depending on what side of a line one is born is either lazy or dangerous, depending on ow charitable one is being. Suggesting that there are "urban states" and "rural states" is either lazy or dangerous, depending on how one takes it. Do you think that Florida doesn't have farmers, or that Hawaii doesn't have cities?

The US Senate is perhaps the most profoundly unrepresentative governing body in the democratic world. There are different ways to justify it, such as that it is simply "the way it was designed", which is what I call lazy, or suggesting that people who live on different sides of a historical line fundamentally are worth ore democratically, which I called dangerous.

Or we can simply acknowledge that out governing system is not that well designed, or at least is not that well designed for a democratic society. We can exult a problem or aknowledge it. Our choice, I guess.The House of Lords is not a governing body. Even if it were unified and motivated it can only delay passage, and does not ave a serious governing function. As for the Senate before 1913, I really don't know how to break that to you, but it is the year 2017 right now, and I don't recall saying the Senate is the most undemocratic governing body that ever existed.

Leaving that all aside, you have still not answered my basic question, why is the line between Wyoming and Colorado so important in the Senate that the vote of a person on one side of the line is worth nearly an order of magnitude more than a person on the other side? Or, in other words, what exactly is the use of having such a hideously unrepresentative governing body? If it is an urban/rural issue, which is what you say in your earlier comment, to whit:

&gt;It gives the minority of the country that lives in rural areas or in large, sparsely populated states, a greater voice in the federal government.

Then these somewhat arbitrary lines is a very poor way of doing so given that the very large rural populations in high population states, and urban populations in low populations states.

If its point was to give rural representation, it does a terrible job of that (and that is because it was not, in fact, designed for that). I mean I guess it does a good job of giving low population states an equal voice to high population states, by which I mean voters in low population  states much greater voices than voters in high population  states, but why is that a good thing? Why are these state borders so valuable, so incredibly *real* that they should be afforded such power in the upper house of congress?I agree, though I give them a break as they aren't even a year old yet.

I do think they have an opportunity here to explain things that most people don't even know about: What's the Export-Import Bank? What are marginal tax rates? What is the U.S. role in Yemen? How do sanctuary cities actually work? All could be distilled in a user-friendly way.The guest made it seem as though she’d prefer a company do nothing at all rather than promote awareness if it brings the company good publicity.  
  
Her claims that it took 100x more for the Baker Hughes to execute their pink-painted drill bit PR move than they donated (100k) to the foundation is flagrant bullshit. Is she seriously claiming they spent 10 million to carry that campaign out?  
  
Also, her views of the “roughnecks” receiving the information about the campaign were so damn condescending. Was she implying they wouldn’t care enough to relay information about their wives potential health or what was her point in saying “like oil rig workers are gonna put a brochure in their back pocket and take it home to the women in their lives”?  
  
As if that point wasn’t made poorly enough, she ends it with some classic whataboutism “never mind the benzene the workers are exposed to that is linked to male breast cancer.  
  
Now I can understand taking the company to task if the information they were giving out was false. Or if they had done the promotion without donating or making the effort to educate. The way I see it, this company teamed up and donated to a charity (opinions on Komen set aside) and sent out material to better educate a population that could be lacking in knowledge on the subject. Whether they aimed to receive good PR is utterly beyond the point.Of the five (now six) Crooked podcasts, all except for PSA and Loli are long form and in depth. I think it is a good mix, and I personally don't want them to change PSA into explanatory journalism, in part because I already have plenty of those, and in part because it isn't their area of competence. The CM team is great, they are fu to listen to and do a great job of summarizing the news, but there is no reason why John, Jon and Tommy should be trying to compete with Lawfare, Vox, No Jargon, etc.This was very good. I thought this was going to be more of a hitpiece on Kommen, and while there are elements of that, it is mostly about deeper issues around breast cancer. Makes me hopeful for the new podcast.&gt; As if that point wasn’t made poorly enough, she ends it with some classic whataboutism “never mind the benzene the workers are exposed to that is linked to male breast cancer.
&gt; 

That is not whatabaoutism by even the most expansive definition of he term. She is pointing out that a company is trying to whitewash the fact that it recklessly and knowingly puts its employees in the way of risk by going on a low cost PR campaign, much as how the NFL tried to wash out its own domestic violence controversy by getting players to wear pink cleats.

And the point about the "roughnecks" isn't condescending, it is a simple fact that the fracking operations are overwhelmingly male and dependent on seasonal labor. As an "awareness raising" campaign it is ridiculous because, of course, it isn't about raising awareness, it is about PR.Do you know what whataboutism is? Quote from wiki: “[attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument.”](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism)  
  
She did not disprove the efficacy of the campaign but instead charged them with hypocrisy with the quote I included in my original comment. Textbook.  
  
A sound argument against the campaign would be something like, “awareness levels among employees was at [very high level] previously, making the campaign useless.” Or “the information in the pamphlets was misleading the employees.” 
  
Fracking operations are overwhelmingly male. I’m just assuming because she didn’t provide any facts, but they’re probably not highly educated. How is giving their employees information they might not have, that could help someone in that employees’ life, a bad thing?Good bot. The Fracking company is not taking a position or advancing an argument against Breast Cancer Action, so no, "whataboutism" is not relevant.

And as I said, the fracking operations are overwhelmingly male and dominated by seasonal labor, which means that *there are not* the women to give these pamphlets to. It is pointless and the definition of pinkwashing.Okay this was a great pod, but I just want to throw something only tangentially related out there.

I don't have a Twitter and man, I really wonder about what the fuck is going on in the Twitter world. I know it is an extremely important and useful mode of mass communication, but...I don't know. The guys on the pod and every journalist I hear from mention it CONSTANTLY. Nearly every conversation, every article has a mention of someone's tweet or some bullshit like that. On the pod they've even talked about how the Twitter culture has an enormous impact on the journalism world and on the world at large, but I am still always thunderstruck by how god damn important and urgent social media is and how often people fucking talk about it! I'm not complaining or annoyed, I'm legitimately confused and flabbergasted. The world wasn't like this a few years ago.

I just read a takedown of the WSJ editorial page in a Vanity Fair article here, and there are just tons of references to Tweets: https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/11/the-wall-street-journal-editorial-board-coverage-of-mueller

This whole pararaph is about a Twitter interaction:
&gt;Recently, national security reporter Shane Harris tweeted a link to that October 26 editorial, which was titled, “Democrats, Russians and the FBI; Did the bureau use disinformation to trigger its Trump probe?” Along with the link, Harris wrote, “US intel agencies developed their own reporting on Trump/Russia contacts. Some back to 2015.” And in a subsequent tweet: “Dossier didn’t exist when FBI investigation began. Fmr snr intel official also told me it played zero role in conclusion of Russian meddling.” A reader asked, “then why is your editorial board putting out garbage editorials saying the opposite?” “I have no role in what the editorial board chooses to write,” Harris replied. Indeed, while the Journal didn’t have a comment for this article, a spokeswoman pointed me to a tweet yesterday from @WSJopinion reinforcing its independence from the newsroom. Editorial page editor Paul Gigot also declined to comment.

What a weird world.

I really liked the podcast. I really like Yellin and I don't know much about Hamby, but I liked what I heard. I think they were both great at giving insider looks at how news is made/broadcast/produced, stuff I don't ever think about, and how big of an impact it can have.

One problem I had (not really with the podcast) was that the guests kept telling us about how out of touch the media higher-ups are and how the media bungled 2016. The problem is that a) all of us listening already knew that, and b) none of us listening are in any position to change that. Telling *us* that treating Trump with kid gloves for half a year was bad is preaching to the choir: we'd been saying it for a full year and a half at this point. They need to talk to people at CNN or the NYTimes, or other places where people actually have the power to change it. Telling a bunch of leftist millennials who don't watch cable news isn't going to change the situation.I think the episode makes a pretty strong case the prosecutors have extraordinary power, and in that way I think it is a bit much to absolve them of responsibility. Nobody is forcing them to bully a kid into taking a plea deal, but the incentives overwhelmingly favor succesful prosecution over responsibility to justice.Keith Ellison is on tonight's show. Jon hinted on twitter they will discuss it.

Edit: I meant the PSA twitter.Absolutely. Even today. I have no doubt that browsing T_D is a big part of many young people’s ‘indoctrination’ into the cult of Trump. The sense of community and the joy they take in the ridiculousness of it all is appealing to lonely young people who are looking for something to belong to I guess. Yes. They should have for sure. When they don’t address these things it just feeds into the Trump/right wing messages that the DNC is corrupt and at war with each other. Serious question for anyone who has gone and seen Lovett live and felt the need to hiss, why?So many immature people. The crowd reactions, some of the contestants, many of the questions. Oh man primary concerns was great. He's such a smart addition to the Crooked team, especially as editor in chief.I don't agree with OP here but the only comment that bugged me on this issue on this pod was something along the lines of "we need more women representatives in politics because women are better at communicating and compromising than men." We absolutely do need more women representatives but I think that's a pretty stupid argument. Things like that might be where OP is coming from, but he's pretty much making a big deal out of nothing.

About race: There's sometimes a small implication in dialogues about race in liberal spaces like this pod that all white men are sitting pretty, like we're all Bill Gates or something, even though many of us are also struggling economically. I don't think panelists actually believe that. It's just a short implication that might ruffle feathers of people like OP because it's crude and quick societal analysis. My thoughts anyway.Ahhh *thank you*!!! Surprisingly simple explanation but I was dying of curiosity every time it happened. Feel like a rock has been lifted off my shoulders. :)Ok agree on Alyssa and Sally Yates.  And don’t mind the tour interviews as much as I mind the constant, incessant applause.  Which turns into pandering for the applause.  I don’t have this pandering issue when they are in studio.  And my shitburger comment wasn’t meant to be about it’s usage on tour but it’s ongoing usage followed by lots of laughter as if it’s some sort of brilliant thing to incorporate shit into a newly coined word.  I believe the latest is “shitsville”.  Hilarious.  Pundit is indeed [super freaking cute](https://twitter.com/jonlovett/status/909850894602141696?lang=en) but I also do not understand this inside joke. :( Based on the Twitter comments it's because she stays quiet during Game of Thrones?LOL, that was an excellent read. I love that Politifact got in on this. Pod bless Pundit the angel. :) thank you!I actually couldn't tell what they were booing, but that's pretty hilarious if that is what it was. I think DC is the only place where a PSA crowd would boo that.

Also hissing is still great.I don't think he actually hates it, it just doesn't show up well on the audio. But now it is a bit.On the Lawfare podcasts everyone pronounces it "Muller" (or Muh-ller or however you want to write it out) and I assume they would know.Seriously? That's fucked.Mine is not showing up since INDICTMENTS!!Haven’t listened but already love the title. The crowd at Lovett or leave it works because it's a comedy show. I've been to a couple of them and there are only 100-200 people there, tops. The PSA shows have THOUSANDS of people, and the cheering doesn't work well with the policy discussion format of the show.Yeah, I listened to that today. The difference is that Beutler is willing to actually come out and say it: "narrative truth" means *lies*. Bannon loves lies and he loves making shit up to suit his purpose, but it gets veiled in this gloss of "narrative truth".I think she was actually referring more to the ‘idea’ of her that people have on twitter - her ‘brand’. Like she was saying being a misandrist is part of the idea these twitter trolls have of her. 

But yeah, I don’t know. It’s tough. I love them 95% is the time but there are points in these podcasts where I kind of roll my eyes a bit. I’m liberal but at a certain point the liberal ideology some people have slips into ridiculousness and completely unproductive territory, like promoting the putting down of one thing rather than the raising of another. i.e. proudly identifying as a ‘misandrist’ who hates men rather than explaining why you’re a proud feminist and that your motivation is purely to raise women up and fight for them to be equal in society. it serves nothing to glorify pettiness and divisiveness at the end of the day. I’m sure I’d enjoy it in the moment in the venue but it’s just annoying listening at home and having to wait 5-10 seconds whenever someone makes a decent point so the crowd can scream and holler about it. The conversation can breathe so much easier on the regularly recorded eps. The one thing I love about the live shows is that it features Dan with the other 3. To be honest I now find the eps with just Favs and Dan a be boring because the dynamic between the other three has gotten so entertaining as he show has gone on, but Dan gets really well when the four are together. But yeah, I have the same problems you do in terms of the crowd stuff. It’s genuinely one of the reasons I don’t enjoy the live shows that much anymore. It’s so childish and I feel like most of Lovett’s lecturing to the audience about it is genuinely him being annoyed now, whereas it started out as him just playing it up for comedy’s sake. The one thing that makes me actually excited about the frequency of the live shows now is the fact that it’s Dan with the other 3. Honestly I’ve been getting a bit bored of the Thursday Pod with just favs and Dan because the dynamic of the other 3 has gotten so entertaining and makes for better listening imo, but Dan works really well when it’s the four together. But I wish they wouldn’t have any more than the four for the main portion of the episode. I listen to this podcast because I appreciate the opinions and voices of these 4 after having listened to them for so long. A separate guest segment is great of course but I wish the main portion was just the main crew. The shot should be wider, so we can see all the respect on both sides This is such BS. I didn't care much for Sanders either and I'm not prejudiced. You're just trying to shut someone down for no reason over the internet, probably because it makes you feel righteous. It's such a dick move to be so dismissive and accuse someone of being racist for having an opinion. Maybe he is, but you don't know the guy. Internet conversations like this drive me crazy because it's so easy to forget we're engaging in human interaction. I doubt the path of this conversation would have taken place had each of you been looking each other in the eyes. End rant.Agree completely, I think it’s kind of similar to how Lovett’s pod wouldn’t work in a studio setting. The crowd play works for a comedy show with political topics like Lovett or Leave It, not for a political show with comedic discussion and moments like Pod Save America. Gotta love Dan being part of the hip Monday crew for these live datesThose are three huge names. Wild.Might try listening at a faster speed if you’d like to listen to more pods than you have time for. 1.25x isn’t really noticeable once you’re listening and it takes an hour podcast down to 48 minutes if my mental math holds. The alternate take is that this sentiment, while nice, has its priorities out of place and is basically cutting off the nose to spite the face.

What is more important: 

A media company like Crooked receiving adequate funding to pursue progressive goals and continue to expand

 OR

Stopping a couple ads for a company Nestle owns

By the way, Nestle owns damn near everything under the sun...look them up. We ALL have tons of Nestle products in our houses right now. Crooked would have to turn down ad money from hundreds of potential companies.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nestlé_brandsI highly recommend Rhetoric coffee in Oakland or Olympia coffee in WA instead. I've had subscriptions to both[There's this one.](http://i.imgur.com/RB3m7zQ.jpg)I would like their hot takes on how dogs can be part of the Resistance.VERY exciting. Love that they're creating pods that amplify a diverse cross section of voices.PSA, LIOLI are my ALWAYS listen. The others are dependent on the guests and topics for the particular episode.It's important too because it drives up Democratic turn out so even if Dems don't win that specific race, they're still showing up and voting on other local and statewide measures.The interview with Johndai and Nicole was very interesting. I think that the thing that speaks to me the most is that how our prison system needs to include ways for the incarcerated to better themselves. Rehabilitation should be the focus, but nothing in our current system supports that.It’s nice to have a pod where the tension of an upcoming election or crucial issue (i.e. healthcare repeal attempt etc) isn’t the main thing and basis of the discussion. They earned the win and it’s cool to have a more celebratory pod. For real she was one of the guests on LOILI that’s made me laugh the most. I really liked this episode, and I think I've come back around on the show.

Hillary Clinton is an incredibly fascinating historical figure, and we'll be talking about her impact for generations. When you remove her electoral politics from the topics, there is something to be learned from the way she approached public life, policy shifts in the country, and even her personal relationships. This is the first conversation I've heard about HRC since the convention that didn't also mention Trump or Sanders or Obama, really at all.

Not bad, AMC.I always got the impression they want to keep it private but yeah there have been a few things where they’ve been public, like Ronan posting stuff with Jon on Instagram. I think they just don’t want to make it a central topic of the discussion whenever Ronan is on the show, and have it hanging over the conversation.  I really hope they bring back ‘The Cuck Zone’ with Tim Miller soon. Those "ladies" are two of the most powerful and influential journalists in the country. Katy Tur was on the campaign trail with Trump for months on end. Your anger is totally misplaced.Glass closet. They're not hiding but considering Ronan's career path(s) seemed to be either public media figure or working at State in perhaps LGBT-unfriendly countries or they just like privacy. That almost got a spit take from me.LOL I'm pretty positive that's a Taylor Swift song.The Gawker talk honestly made me a little uncomfortable. The whole point one of them made that Jon was on board with of “its scary how one man was able to just make Gawker bankrupt because he didn’t like how they reported in him”. I mean, Christ, they outed him, a public figure and business person, as gay. That’s deplorable. Not to mention the infamous Gawker stalker shit and the Hulk Hogan shit, and the attitude the Gawker CEO (I think) displayed in those trial videos that got a lot of attention. 

I get that Gawker reported things that others weren’t, but I fully think the world is better without it. It’s not worth the rest of the shit that they do. I like that Favs said to Tommy and Jon that they should ease off the ridiculing of photos of Trump looking stupid in various situations, because it’s too easy and people did it with Obama. For real, it always bothers me when the left spreads around a photo of him like wildfire and take the piss out of it, when in reality if you looked around there’s probably photos of him looking every which way during whatever event it’s from. Still photos are no representation of the tone of an event at all. READ THIS BOOK! I can't stress that enough, and neither can Tommy, apparently. READ IT. Dark Money by Jane Meyer. The hidden story of the billionaires behind the rise of the radical right. They should have a twitter/instagram dedicated solely to their dogs, honestly.They're all doodles of some kind, but I THINK Lucca is a labradoodle while Leo and Pundit are goldendoodles.lmfao "Leo refuses to be commercialized"

AMAZINGActually, I think Jason Kander may have tweeted something about being on Keepin' it 1600 post-election. I checked it out, and then somehow learned they were making PSA.

Thanks, J-Kan!I presume it was a mistake, since the topic creator just described finding PSA.Basis of your statement?Their first Colbert appearance. Thought they were super funny and the idea of Obama’s speech writers having a podcast was cool. Yes, why is this being forgotten. He motioned and posed like he was grabbing but clearly was not. I can’t believe Dan is drawing an equivalence between Al Franken’s misconduct and Roy Moore’s. Essentially saying “we keep saying we think Moore should step down as a senate candidate so maybe it’s our duty to say Franken should resign from senate”. No. Christ almighty, Franken did something gross, tasteless, and inarguably immature. He embarrassed that woman and hurt her. Moore is a multiple offence paedophile. It seems like the Crooked team doesn't have anyone doing basic mixing, eq, compression, mastering?

Hey guys, if you're listening I will do it for free. With no bathroom breaks!They've always been the same concept but Lovett is far more irreverent and intellectual. I think Lovett is a lot funnier too.&gt;two stupid jokes were made and the segment was over. What the hell! 

It's a live comedy show at The Improv, a stand up comedy venue in Hollywood. Drink minimum and everything. It's not what you seem to think it is.

I listen to substantive discussions literally all week long and I am thankful that Lovett or Leave it can make me laugh at the end of the week. Otherwise I'd be crying.I've heard her on podcasts enough to be used to it by now.Really liked van and Langston. I️ haven’t paid good enough attention to the names of all the guests but they’re up in the tops for me. Tommy’s sarcastic shitting all over Bannon is the best. It's literally a show at a comedy club my dude.Yes, definitely. The music in the intro after the ad was incredibly loud so I had to turn it down, but then the dialogue of the episode itself was again quiet. It’s really annoying that one of the most successful podcast providers in the world doesn’t have this sort of thing sorted. Outside In: Foreigners from around the world examine US politics (with the aid of a charming host) from their own countries’ perspectives: how the German, Chinese, Brazilians, etc... view the affairs of the United States. 

As a foreigner, it’s always a little disheartening to see Americans put down foreigners when they offer their opinion on American events, like Jon did a few weeks ago on Lovett or Leave It with that British guest (in the crowd). It could really lend some perspective on things. Tommy taking the piss out of Jon mentioning how he used to put ‘writer’ as his profession was hilarious. 
Not necessarily only foreign policy issues, but also American issues. French politics is REALLY similar to American politics with regard to scandals, the most recent similarity being with Fillion. 
Clearly wasn’t anything legitimate or he would’ve answered me lolIt would be nice! A companion, but with a focus on the states, linking our current events to their storied pasts. There’s a lot we can learn about activism and representation from the French, Koreans, Germans, and South Africans. Their struggles mirror our own, and to have the closest thing to aliens examine current events would be both hilarious and insightful!I agree. Not sure why you're downvoted, probably as a reflex because your post is vitriolic. You're 100% right.Assembling a broad array of voices weekly would be difficult - but doing so on a monthly basis would be much more feasible. Moreover, it would be easier to triage events that unfold over the course of a month rather than a week, setting aside tedious bursts of news (Trump’s tweets) from substantial “story lines” (the tax plan, healthcare, our two wars we’re still fighting). 

I agree with regard to an audience’s potential to respond irritably to foreigners railing the US, but I would argue this is knee-jerk reaction that will subside quickly. We’re all just people, and a foreigner can be as funny, charming, and respectful as an American when they turn their critical eye Stateside. 

Of course I’m really into this idea because I’m an naturalized citizen, but my parents are from southeast Europe. I’ve lived in America, Europe, and China, always surrounded by foreigners. 

As with Lovett - I love him. Seriously, he is the funniest voice I’ve ever come across, and the few times I’ve seen him on television he’s been just as hilarious and twice as charming! I recognize his choice as a comedic bit - it just stung a little is all hahaha:)

Foreigners can teach us a lot about how to beat conduct activism. The French protest daily, and a lot of other countries the world over have a strong history of social activism. South Korea, India, South Africa, Turkey, Greece - their voices could be a great way to comedically present a parallel experience. It's probably mostly being defensive of the guys. I'm a huge fan of all of them and I think they're head and shoulders smarter than I am, so distilling criticism is tough. That goes for all public intellectual figures I admire. I think everyone reckons with that from time to time about figures they admire. In this case OP is right. What they need is a different kind of pod - something with a different format entirely. 

I think they should do their own version of the New York Times "The Daily." Short, daily, and focused with cinematic sound design and a blend of investigative/expository journalism. I missed 2008 by 18 days. It was very annoying.It ended up for the better. I was still under the spell (curse?) of FOX News at the time, before my long journey to the realization that I was a hardcore liberal, so I was going to vote for McCain anyway. It didn't wear off until a couple years ago.

Sad I'll never be able to tell my grandchildren I voted for Obama. :(The Run for Something interview was great, I really liked it and she was a great interview guest.

Happy Thanksgiving everyone! Can confirm this man is correct.

*We're SWITCHING to MDR V6s and SM57bs! We're NOT USING the other equipment ANYMORE!*They really need to get someone to sort out the audio levels. It’s usually just the live shows but there’s a big discrepancy in the levels of the ad reads and transitions and main portions of the show. I didn't care for her"To stan" someone or something is just to be a very big fan of them, to the point where you will be vocal about your support (think the Edward vs Jacob debate when Twilight was hot). It's also a noun: "I'm a Jason and Diana stan."

I don't know. Internet culture.I thought he might be referring to "Pocahontas" especially since Warren was just on. But Veritas is the story with legs.Glad that everyone else is starting to realize how gross it is that Crooked Media employs this slimy fuck*He’s pro-choice, even after 20-weeks of pregnancy. I strongly disagree with that*

Yeah this asshole is definitely an ally of the left. So if Miller is so revolted by this laundry list of like 15 awful things that every republican believes in, why did it take him until now to denounce this piece of shit?

Also I don’t quite understand his priorities b/c he phrases the article like he’s saying “being a child predator is one thing. But being a child predator who believes in basic republican values? Why I never.”Did that ad read at the beginning insinuate Lovett is getting married next year?That's cuteHere's a behind the scenes look at Souza and the WH photographer role, if anyone wants to know more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeVkHt2c6eYGood point! Love that they're doing so many shows in Texas. I think they're really trying to encourage activism to take down Ted Cruz.They are going to Europe? Wild! I wonder what those tours will be like.Any reason these are not showing up on the Google play store? I keep having to goto the website, which is fine but it doesn't save my place. Hate to be a downer but I'm tired of these live episodes. It's perfect for Lovett or Leave It but imo it just hinders so many aspects of PSA and the depth of the conversation. The part at the start where Dan was going over the people Flynn might be flipping on (Jared, Don Jr, DJT) and there was thunderous whooping each time - that just honestly made me cringe. I find the notion exciting too but something about the constant hollering at any somewhat forceful liberal point made, or any point against Trump made, is just tiresome and annoying to me. 

ehThey definitely drastically change the tone of the show towards more crowd work like Lovett or Leave It and less towards the depth of the discussion. Yep, exactly. It's annoying because having both sides of that - the pep rally sort of atmosphere for LIOLI and a more focused and in depth atmosphere and studio setting for PSA - is why I enjoy both pods and CM in general. Now it's just becoming one thing. &gt;This move makes a lot of sense because CA voters aren't likely to mind their House elections being national ordeals

CA here. I live in one of these districts. PLEASE help us kick these fuckers out of office! Happy to be national news if it means I get a representative that is actually trying to help my life instead of screwing me overWell first of all, that is hilarious because most people in CA aren't religious, or if they are they don't go to church or practice it. Nobody I know is religious. 1% identify as Mormon and Scientology isn't even statistically relevant. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_California#Religion)

And yeah I do  think national attention on congressional races would be a huge boon to progressive candidates, at least in non-rural areas. Californians are proud but we're also pretty socially inclusive (TONS of transplants and diversity here) and we're very used to the national spotlight.Can’t believe I️ just listened to grown ass men complain about having to sit through a Frozen short before seeing Coco. Ya think maybe you aren’t quite the target audience Disney is trying to reach? And that maybe the kids that the movie was made for really enjoyed getting a bonus short of another movie they probably love? Just wtf was the point of that? Especially to open an episode. Kerr! YUGE respect for the guy and so glad he has chosen to speak out and use his platform. Him and Pop have been the most outspoken of the coaches in the nba from what ive seen. Hope Kerr plans on more political podcast appearances. I heard reports that children were getting restless during it as well and that Disney is removing the short.Yeah, I don’t mind black humor like but it doesn’t fit the tone of the show and a lot of those kinds of jokes are the kind that many on the left don’t tolerate people on the right saying. Like when they mock Melania (particularly last week) and imitate her accent and all this, while simultaneously complaining about how so many right wingers are racist and insensitive. Watched a clip of Tim Miller speaking from this episode that they put on the PSA twitter. Not relevant to the discussion at all but his hair is weird now and I feel weird about it. (sorry)Absolutely agree, I have no problem with Anne but her humor and general vibe doesn’t work with the PSA guys very well imo but Erin seems much more naturally fitting. That's because it's a gross oversimplification to the point of being absolutely wrong. I get the point and it's good that it helped you make a connection but there's just so many things wrong with that analysis I don't even know where to begin.No thanks I have a life and shit to do right now, bullshit on the internet isn't *that* importantWhile I generally fall in with the leftist critique of antifa, the whole "Caesar's wife must be above reproach" thing that democrats have is super self destructive. Read through your source thoroughly, where are the complaints by children? I️ see parents complaining, but not a single complaint from a child.  
  
Also, you source says it isn’t unusual to show for Disney/Pixar to run shorts before other movies.  
  
The suggestions that it was shown to draw in white crowds because Coco couldn’t has no evidence to back it up. Did Disney advertise the short to draw in crowds? You can’t take the stance that the short was used to bring people in and still take the stance that it was sprung on unwitting audience. So which was it?  
  
Finally, you seem to take “grown ass men” as a pejorative when it is not. I️ strive to be a grown ass man in the way I handle things. All men should. With the background, education, and their positions, I️ assume these guys are grown ass men. Which is why it surprised me they opened an episode, that should deal with the most important issues, with a rant on a a frozen short. They were going to see a movie about a minority here and got pissed because they had to sit through a 20 minute shows starring a white lady? Seems a little racist on their part to me actually. No I’m not claiming DeRay is a racist. If you’d listen to the episode before you go arguing on its behalf you’d know DeRay didn’t really say shit. I️ don’t even think he saw the movie. This was mainly between Sam and iii. Also not calling them racist, but if you’re mad because the race of a character isn’t what you’d prefer, that is nothing but a racist point.  
  
You’re making the argument that Disney promoted the short heavily (many people would have known about the short). You’re also making the point that the short was bad because so many people were surprised by it being played.  
  
So, did all the people who saw the advertisements for the short not go, only leaving the unknowing and thus the confusion and outrage? Find that unlikely. Is there another explanation for these two seemingly contradictory points to both be correct I’m missing?  
  
The short plus Coco was 7.4% longer than Cars and The Incredibles plus their respective shorts. Is the outrage really about the total experience being to long for children? Was there outrage at Cars and The Incredibles? Coco was not a short film for the studios either, so they can’t feel cheated on the length of the actual movie. 
  
Edit: Also reread the article (minus the included outrage tweets, because come on), no complaints from children listed. Pretty good episode.

I think all of us are wrestling with how to feel about Al Franken now. He used to be someone I admired and now I feel like I have to reevaluate everything, you know? But yeah, I think Franken needed to step down and I hope that Dems holding their own accountable for bad behavior pays off in the long run, beyond just being the right thing to do.

I skipped the end though. Tbh, I don't fuck with Jesse Williams anymore. His caping for Nate Parker last year really put a sour taste in my mouth for him.Yeah. And showing up to the premiere for the movie. It's just infuriating that someone who has built his brand on activism and 'wokeness' apparently had no qualms about supporting a rapist. I just can't look at him the same way.So Europe gets four shows before Atlanta gets a show? Jeez. 

And the boys are in Europe the one week I'm not in Holland. GREAT. 
SO. 
GREAT.I don't fucking careI didn’t really get what was going on there tbh... Someone (Emily maybe?) was also doing a live video on Instagram in the room, except it was on Leo’s insta so it was like Leo and Pundit playing around with the Jons commentary in the background. 

The presence of dogs improves everything imo!&gt;How are there posters hanging on a curtain, that’s the real question rn

Seriously!LucccccaaaaaaNope. Not happening. 

He would be in the senate only one year before campaigning started and Dems would be choosing someone else much more established in the primary. People are only saying it now because he's in the news. I saw a poll several weeks ago that asked to choose between Donald Trump and Federica Wilson. Why? Because she was in the news.

Reminder that Tim Miller is a loathsome piece of shit who clearly hasn’t been bullied enough. Maybe if he was bullied more he’d be too ashamed to make fun of liberals on crooked media while defending the “turn poor people into soylent” tax bill and making jokes about how abortion should be illegal. Someone stick this asshole’s face in a toilet, please. Yeah I couldn’t care less if “he’s a heel.” This isn’t a game. He doesn’t get to be in on the joke about his abhorrent beliefs. He is the fucking joke, and should be treated as such. He has no sense of humor or intelligence or ethics, so it’s always the most unfunny, evil, and idiotic option.  His joke was completely and obviously ironic. I think saying "as Jesus would have, as a fuck you" should have been a tip off.&gt; And then this week he just went off on Republicans but doesn’t seem to care that these are his peers?

Literally the entire point of the rant was predicated on them being his peers.Tim Miller has been super vocal in his criticism of Republicans in all forums, not just CM podcasts. His tweet after the Alabama race was "Cheers to all the craven assholes who knew better but endorsed a guy who molested a 14 year old girl anyway."Their discussion of Doug Jones sort of bothered me. Not the specific points themselves - I agree it was stupid and naive what he said about Trump’s allegations of sexual abuse, and definitely agree with Tommy that since Jones will almost definitely lose in 2020 that he should say whatever he wants and be as progressive as possible. But Lovett making his big point about “Jones *obviously* didn’t win because Alabamans suddenly decided to give a Democrat a shot” bugged me, not because I disagree (it’s obviously accurate to say that), but because it flies in the face of the discussion Favs and Dan had around Jones and with Jones himself last episode. Favs and Dan basically leaped praise on how Jones ran his campaign and how effective he was in his message discipline and all this, and they barely touched on the glaring fact that he basically only won due to his opponent being the antichrist. And fair enough if they want to discuss that and hold that view but Lovett saying this episode that basically none of that matters makes last episode’s discussion feel irrelevant. 

I’m just rambling at this stage but basically they were totally in Jones’ corner last Ep when he was in the liberal good books and acted like him making right moves was mostly responsible for his win, but now that he’s gotten in hot water with the left all that stuff doesn’t matter and he ‘only won because his opponent was shitty’. The inconsistency of the PSA view on Jones and how it’s changed in light of how favorable he is or isn’t at whatever given moment is really an issue for me. Doug Jones did run a good campaign, not just anybody could have won there. But just as much, he could not have beaten just anybody. There needed to be a very strong Democratic candidate *and* a very weak one, which I don't think the PSA crowd has *ever* denied.

So given that, it is pointless for him to take the somewhat reprehensible stance that people should just get over sexual assault.Luke's dad is Darth VaderSymone honestly annoys the hell out of me. She never lets anyone finish speaking, she drops facts that are not relevant to the conversation, she seems to combative with everyone even people who are taking her side, and why is she always yelling? Just my opinion I know some people really like her but she really irks me. You’re not alone, I just looked I made less than 6 minutes before I quit listening.I quit listening after the water analogy. I was annoyed with the host already but when she said that I was done. Bummer. Same sentiments hereAs much as I agree with you that waiting for Brown to be seated was the right thing to do. What exactly did we gain from that? Some good headlines on Morning Joe? The Republicans held up a Supreme Court seat until their President got elected which is absolutely despicable...but now they have Gorsuch in that seat for a generation. They refused to seat Doug Jones and possibly because of that their tax bill passed. My point being is that we shouldn't do the right thing because it's the right thing, this is politics and we need to get down in the mud and fight for what we believe in because the "high road" has given us jackshit.Jason brought up Pitch and now I'm sad about its cancellation all over again. ;_;Would’ve been nice if the interview was with one of the Dem senators who doesn’t seem fully committed to demanding action on DACA over stopping a shutdown, because I’d like to hear Favs and Dan actually have that tough conversation and maybe try to convince him/her, rather than pretty much reflecting on the situation as it is with a senator who’s 100% on their side anyway. I enjoyed the interview, but I guess it’s more a general thing that I wish they would have more interviews with guests who they have constructive arguments with and have to debate on important issues. Tommy interviewing/debating with the head of the WH Press Corps (his name escapes me) about their inaction to reprimand the trump admin for the lack of press access was excellent and I really hope there’s more of that sort of thing in future. Do you mean the cartoon itself has tonnes of misinformation or the discussion in the comments?He’s worn it before during interviews at practice I believe. I think he’s actually trying to do his part in building awareness, really cool. Some Bernie supporters are still mad Warren didn’t support Bernie in the primaries. Can’t open it on my phone browser so I will listen when I get home but THANK YOU!!!I'm not sure where you get that. Matt's humor mostly comes from stating things very bluntly but I don't see why that would translate to being thin skinned. OH MY GOD IT'S EZRA KLEIN!

[looks at history]

Man, who would have thought Ezra Klein had that sort of post history?While I have seen plenty of articles from a left/progressive and material perspective critiquing palace intrigue stories, I thought this was a good one from a purely media-centric approach. In short, how the Michael Wolf gossip is not a fundamentally different thing than Breitbart propaganda in its basic style.I just made a thread for this, but here:  https://crooked.com/article/bannon-trump-wolff/Indiana (South Bend since Mayor Pete was on an early episode and they seem to be big fans of one another), Michigan, Ohio, MinnesotaI am not sure it is *as* immoral--I think the Iran deal is on balance better than a preemptive military strike--but I do agree that there is a real lack of progressive principle or any critical approach within the party. The *entire* party, mind, not just those towards the center.

It is a real structural problem with American foreign policy, what Ben Rhodes called "the blob". Because no matter how instinctively or temperamentally anti-interventionist you are, be you Obama in '08 or Trump in '16, you need to staff up to run foreign policy, and the only place to draw that staff is "the blob".

I honestly think this is the long shadow of HUAC and McCarthey.I am a pretty regular listener to Deep State Radio and the Lawfare podcasts for the same reason. Regardless of my own views, the liberal internationalist/interventionist position holds a monopoly on foreign policy thought and understanding it is neccesary to understand American policy.Hard to beat Jimmy "no shots fired" Carter.

Honestly the day to day operation of US foreign policy is so continuous across administrations that I don't think you can meaningfully "rank" them, but Obama's rather creative use of the AUMF, beyond even what Bush did, and handling of the drone and targeted killings programs, expanding them beyond even Bush, makes me not really want to give him much of a medal.Except Jimmy Carter!

But in all seriousness, I think assessing Obama's presidency will be a lot more complicated than assessing Clinton or Dubya (for both of whom I would argue that the assessments of their terms made immediately after they left office were considerably closer to the mark than ones made now), and unlike them his successor is so heinous we will really need to let this whole administration play out before we can reach some sort of balanced analysis.

I think the general difference between him and the other presidents I have lived through (41-45) is that he had a consistently progressive vision, but the problem is that he always tried to do push it through with some 4D Chess bullshit.I refreshed no less than 35 times throughout the day waiting for this. I love CM but I can't afford any of the bougie things they advertise and I don't know anyone who can.

Blue apron? Tommy john? Zip recruiter? Life insurance?!

They even advertise a flower delivery service!Free-BEES Lovett! It was right there!How nice to have an audience that does not break out into applause every 60 seconds.Really wish they would leave more time for questions. This one was really great! I'm glad the trio got more into the serious repercussions of the book, instead of *just* making jokes (but I think they put enough jokes in there that it punctuated the discussion really nicely).I mean, sure, but I feel like that’s a standard inquiry from a citizen whose government is parliamentary/proportional. I’m curious as to how they’ll handle questions from Brits since their government is also completely inept. I wish they didn’t cut them out. I’m curious to the kinds of questions they have. Why? The whole world is affected by American politics. I thought this was one of the better PSA shows lately as well...I don't understand your first sentence at all. We Americans pander to Europeans? I guess I don't see doing a few shows overseas as pandering, but otoh given our outsized influence maybe the US in general ought to pander to the rest of the world a bit more. If that means treating them like human beings, anyway. Why should the guys at Crooked Media get shit for being white guys? They're just three pals that used to work together who decided to start a podcast to discuss progressive issues...I don't think that should be discredited just because of who they are.American politics has a significant impact all around the world. Why shouldn't Europeans (and hopefully others) be a part of the conversation? 

I don't see it as cultural imperialism at all, but as including more voices in the conversation. It was really interesting to hear from the Swedish Friends of the Pod during the Q and A. I hope we'll get more. 

Someone was criticizing the European tour in the post about the show as well. I'm having a tough time understanding the criticism so I'd genuinely appreciate it if someone would take the time to thoroughly explain why they don't like it. My wife and I were laughing hysterically as we had just listened together the day beforeI love the Crooked guys (with the exception of Tim Miller who I think is unbearable) but it’s really not that diverse. She wasn’t saying that there should be people representing all parts of the oppressed spectrum, but perhaps... maybe more? Idk, I don’t feel like that’s a tall order. Also I don’t speak for her but again, I think MapleQueen’s statements are fair. I hear you and that’s honestly the most likely case. But there is a lot of EPA shit going on, as well as environmental racism (does Flint have clean water yet?). An indigenous host would be sweet. Your answer is partly why I personally am not super offended by it, but it’s still predominantly men, mostly white, and both the women with pods (while I love them both) are white.

The former interpretation of my points you brought up is probably the most accurate. Needs more IMO. Since PSA and LOLI are really focused on like breaking news type stuff, I think it's unlikely we'll get much about environmental issues there unless there's something going on in the news about it.

BUT I think we could maybe get a Crooked Conversation on the topic.I mean I honestly feel like they’re more progressive compared to certain podcasts. They’re not social justice perfectionists but they are far more left wing (and want left wing policies!) than others. Lovett is great. And by god stay still man!The host is wonderful, also.Thanks for the suggestions. 

My whole issue is more activism level (though I do take an interest in the science of it, it's what I want to do as a career). I think the guys have a really good medium to be able to at least do stories on it on their website. I hardly hear anything about the EPA outside of the random bullshit rollback of environmental protections.

An indigenous host and then a scientist/policymaker/expert is necessary, I think, especially trying to get action done on a local level and to push policy measures even in really red districts. Idk, I feel like they're really important and are deeply political and progressive issues that can totally fit in Crooked Media's message.

edit: an indigenous scientist must exist, would be super down for that."Bring it"??
Same! I gave it a listen because I loved Ira in the episodes he was in on Lovett's show but think I will be a regular subscriber now. I wonder if DeRay plans to do some episodes on this? Because you are totally right, environmental protection and systemic racial issues go hand in hand. I'm an environmental engineer that specializes in water- the official word is that Flint's water is safe again. However, their pipes are still a mess (I believe a number of their pipes still leech lead, especially the lateral pipes, or the pipes that are within the walls of houses and on private property). I would not drink the water and I don't blame anyone living in and around Flint for continuing to drink bottled water exclusively. It's really a tragic situation. Trust me I've tweeted at them more times than I can count. I'll tweet at them again though.

I've actually emailed them about it and offered my services, but was ignored (I actually don't blame them for that, I'm sure they get a ton of emails asking for work anyway).Thanks for being receptive. I feel like it should be Crooked's missions to get these issues (as well as others) really ingrained in the minds of voters so they can actually *care* about them going forward. Any environmental issue is ultimately a political issue and one that should be talked about *constantly*.He's done a couple on environmental issues. I'm kinda iffy on DeRay if only because he has some views that I find quite problematic, but he did have an interview (I believe with a former NJ politician) about climate change and why it's important to do work on it.A Crooked Conversation episode (or several) would be good to gauge interest in it.I volunteer to tweet at them incessantly about it until I am blockedAh. TBH, I've only listened to maybe 3 episodes of his. I've never really looked into his opinions too terribly much, I just know he's a lightning rode in some regards. I always thought it was because he's super involved with BLM so maybe the criticism comes from white liberals that don't like acknowledging their privilege? IDK. I'll have to listen to a few more. It’s not so much that for me (at least what I say anyway, I welcome any criticism of the fact; it also wouldn’t surprise me if some who disliked him think this way). His stance on closing public schools is way too right for me. I’ll send him a DM!’OH! I had no idea that was his stance (re: public schools). That's kind of a bummer. And really surprising!Louis Virtel is great. I was tentatively going to listen to this, but I saw he was a co-host for this one and I jumped on in. He wrote for Throwing Shade (another of my favorite podcasts) and I'm glad he knows how to walk the line of seriousness and throwing out quips.

Also he's the [Jeopardy Snap guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYkB5f1X-yM), so he's got that going for him too.It's a meaningless bit of mental masturbation. The fact is that the two cannot be untangled. incompetence impairs holding a moral rudder, and immorality puts skill on a toxic trajectory.

I'm a little surprised speechwriters and comms guys don't feel stronger that they could prop up anyone with some good writing...To say that Al Franken was a "bad" Senator is extremely disingenuous and just plain wrong. He was one of the hardest working members of the Senate whom cabinet appointees feared to go up against in their confirmation hearings due to just how thorough he could be. I mean how many times did a video of him interrogating one of Trump's cabinet picks go viral? Just because of his disgusting personal conduct before he became a Senator(which was wrong and was right to resign over) doesn't mean we should write off his entire career in the Senate being a champion for many, if not all, of the progressive causes we advocate for.But I think that was the problem with making Hillary Clinton our candidate in 2016. She was uniquely qualified to do the job as President as she had a massive resume and knew every bit of detail when it came to policy...but she had no charisma, terrible approval ratings and was under FBI investigation when she won the nomination. We need to stop thinking about who would be the best President and start thinking about who would fucking win. It's sad that those two usually don't go hand-in-hand but it's just how it is.There’s no real reason they shouldn’t. They have he equipment set up already for studio episodes since they use it to Periscope, and they post small video clips from live shows. Maybe they think it’ll hurt their listenership on iTunes if they offer video aswell as audio but Joe Rogan’s always done it and still stayed at the top of the iTunes charts. This was a tough one for me to make it through. I feel very little sympathy for the guest honestly. She has a full-ride, can’t meet the gpa requirements first year, and doesn’t accept any blame. Maybe I misheard, but was she even working her first year? Her mother was taking out loans for her room and board. If she was bombing classes while not even supporting herself she can take her boo hooing far from me. If she was supporting herself I’m much more understanding, it’s hard to work enough to get by and still have time for every class. I must not have been listening close enough to know which it was.  
  
I have some empathy for her frustration with a counselor, I lost a grant because I was misinformed the credit requirements were cumulative versus resetting each year. Maybe stricter standards need to be set for counselors/advisors or a system of accountability for misleading students, but ultimately it’s my fuck up for not making sure I had the correct information. And it’s her fuck up for not making sure she was in the correct class. Then proceeding to struggle through it instead of withdrawing early or getting a tutor.  
  
Also, she must not have a done exceedingly well in her other classes for one D+ to tank her GPA. 30 or so credits in your first year, the calc class was most likely 3. It’ll be tough to convince me she could not have mitigated the affect on her GPA from the calc class by performing well in her other courses. But nnnoooo, it was all that counselors fault for forcing her to take a class she shouldn’t have.  
  
The final result was her graduating with $14k in debt. $14k for a college diploma does not seem like a bad deal. People give that money for a used car  all day, but for the education and opportunities afforded by a college degree it is too much? I’ll be leaving college with debt close if not higher than that. If I could go back I’d do it again.  
  
My biggest issue with my college experience has been the lack of intelligence of my peers. I know I’m getting into r/iamverysmart material and I want to stress I don’t think I’m the smartest guy in all my classes. But holy shit a lot of kids can’t even write at what I would call a high school level. Consistently in group projects, half the group will have the skills required and have to pull the weight for the others half.  
  
In the end, we all get the same grade. My peers who can’t even write a good paper end up with the same degree as the rest of us. So what happens when these people are hired and their employers realize their mental aptitude? The weight of the diploma diminishes for everybody. This is why a bachelors degree is the new HS diploma. I’ll end my rant here.  
  
Edit: I feel it relevant to say I attend a well respected state school in a business program consistently ranked top 10. I can only assume/hope Ivy League schools are closer to what I expected as far as intellect amongst peers. So all she had to do her first 3 years of school was classwork? What a joke. If that’s your only job and you know you have a strict GPA requirement, you have no excuse for not reaching it IMO. She had to work 20-30 hours her senior year? I along with many people I know have clocked in 30-40 hours all four years. Still maintaining 15+ credit hour semesters.  
  
Also, I don’t get how working during her school wouldn’t make a difference? How would making money to support herself not make a difference? Not to get into my personal shit too much but I made 60K during my first three years of school. 60K isn’t enough to make a difference? 80K counting all four years?  
  
If the school does not provide tutoring help, find a better school. She got into 5, surely one has tutoring available to students. My state school has all sorts of FREE-to-ALL students tutoring, NO privilege required.  
  
I said I had some empathy for her advisor screwing her and that maybe there should be a form of accountability when misinformation is given. I’ve been screwed by advising. It sucks. But the advisor is only one source of information that can be double checked elsewhere. She shares some of the blame for the situation, but didn’t seem to acknowledge that at all.  
  
My point on intelligence is counter to the point of the episode and not about Curry. More succinctly, my point was the cost in $$ of the degree doesn’t bother me. It’s the devaluing of the degree by shitty academics that bothers me. You can keep your outrageous tuition rates if you raise your standards and once again provide a degree that means something. Or someone who had to work during more than her senior year. If you expect to go to school for three years, not work, and not have massive amounts of debt, maybe take a financial literacy class at university. I’m sorry but I didn’t see her story as one of hard work at all. Get somebody who is working full time or close to it, supporting themselves, getting their degree, and STILL accumulating debt. If you’re trying to convince the trump voters the college experience is broken, that’s the story you tell. If not, the rebuttable is too easy, “She should’ve gotten a job.”If you have the means please do. I would love to listen and possibly even contribute somehow (not hosting the podcast mind you, I’m not smart enough).I'm pretty sure he describes it in that episode as well. Except it's longer, obviously.I’m going to a top 6 business school (Bloomberg 2016), not a hard major but not a super light courseload by any means. I understand other majors are more intensive. But I also completely designed and permitted plans for a two story house, sourced all the materials, completed a budget and secured financing during my two years. You can’t tell me even the most intense courseload surpasses that. I worked 30+ hours during that period. My days are the same length as everybody else’s, but I have priority and make plenty of sacrifices. I’m one of those silly people who still believe in the American dream for myself.  
  
In one of my classes (maybe 50-60 students) a professor asked how many students worked 30+ hours. Half the class raised their hand. I understand this does not mean it’s typical, but I do want to make the point that my workload isn’t a rarity. We have completely different experiences and unless there is a good study of student working hours across the nation, you can not say mine is any more unusual than yours and vise versa. If there is such a study I will gladly cede my experience is however many deviations from the mean if it is.  
  
&gt;I have literally never heard of someone making this much money on a part time job during college in my life.  
  
Now you have! My job situation is not typical, but is also not something out of reach for many people. I started at minimum wage but have worked with the same company for 8 years and received raises. I make a decent wage, but I wouldn’t call it a “high paying gig.” I just started working young and made effort to further my knowledge on the job to create value for myself. Also if you work a job nobody else wants to, you have much better luck. Also I wish I knew about the London show before I planned my trip or I would have went!Also hoping that I can listen while I try to conquer my jet lag. I thought Shaista was great?I mean I feel like the sections she was in were cut out but I didn’t think she was awful. I listened to the pod, I thought it was greatPlease tell me how I’m a privileged individual. I work for what I have. I’m privileged because I work during college? I believe she should’ve been working because adults should support themselves to the best of their abilities. This is an adult we are talking about. She had a full ride but still had living expenses, SHE CHOSE not to work to contribute to her living expenses.  
  
Every college I looked at talked about their tutor program. She would have heard about the programs during her 4 visits. If she had to choose Howard because of the scholarship but knew they didn’t have tutors, she could have started planning for that. I gave Howard U’s website a visit, looks like they have free tutoring for all “gateway mathematics courses.” I believe this would include calculus.  
  
Two people provide an anecdote about limiting hours, I provide one with half the class working over 30 hours. Like I said, until you show me an actual study, they’re both just anecdotes.  
  
Edit: TIL privilege is having to work through school instead of having your mom take out loans to pay your living expense while an adult. What’s preventing somebody from getting a job and keeping it? I didn’t have any special qualifications and hadn’t even graduated HS when I started. It’s a manual labor job working with shit. The company is always hiring because not many people want to work with shit. And by the job’s nature, the same work is available in every city. I’m failing to see how the vast majority (I’m not saying everybody) could do what I did. The sector I’m in is super lax on criminal records, past employment problems, anything, because labor is scarce in the field. Nothing is stopping people getting the work I do besides not wanting to do it, barring disabilities.   
  
I bring the point of me building my house because it was inferred I had an easy courseload in my major since I’m able to work 30+ hours. Though I don’t believe I had any special means to do it over anybody else, that wasn’t the point I was making. “Of course you had time to work in an easy major” was the argument I interpreted was being made, so my rebuttal was “Yes the major isn’t the most intensive, but I was able to do these other time consuming things in addition to that courseload, and still work the time I did.”This is correct. It's a nomenclature thing. Prince Charles is called such just via his birth. Like he was always Prince Charles. But he was made Prince of Wales as an adult and that's a different title. And it's a title that is just "the Prince of Wales". That's how he's referred to. Well he's "Prince Charles, Prince of Wales". The "Prince Charles" bit coming from his birth and the Prince of Wales bit being a later title.

SO. Diana married him and she became Princess of Wales and that was the appropriate terminology to refer to her. "Diana, Princess of Wales" or just "the Princess of Wales". She was never really "Princess Diana", despite what the media referred to he as. She was always "Diana, Princess of Wales". Oh and they also called her "Lady Di" sometimes. And the "Lady" part of that came from her father. Not a title derived from her marriage.I mean, I'm sure that her family calls her Marie or whatever. But in terms of title, she's just "Princess Michael of Kent". And that's because her husband doesn't have any titles other than just the one he was born with as a result of being a descendant of a male child of a British monarch. He doesn't hold any titles in his own right. If he had a dukedom or an earldom or whatever, she could be referred to as "Duchess of __________" or "Countess  of ___________", much like Kate is "Duchess of Cambridge" and Meghan will probs be  duchess of Sussex or Windsor or whatever (not sure which available dukedom Harry will be gifted). And those are titles in their own right.

lol. It's all very complicated and is 100% due to the fact that under the current naming in the British monarchy the only way to become a princess of Britain is to be born a female descendant of the monarch. WHICH TBH is probably only still a thing because Prince Andrew wants his daughters to be special and afforded the courtesy and respect he believes they're due. When Charles becomes king, he MIGHT change things because he kinda dgaf what his brother wants and it'd honestly just be less complicated if they let women marrying into the family take on the princess title.Agreed. This is such dumb, myopic criticism.&gt; Are you saying that a preference of not wanting to work with shit means she deserves to have her scholarship taken away and have her life in shambles?
  
No, you said my situation was because of privilege. I gave an argument that disproves your faulty assumption.  
  
&gt;There are many who have heavy course loads and cannot work more than a certain number of hours a week. Do they deserve to have debilitating debt?  
  
Yes. Do you not believe people should be responsible for the consequences of their decisions? You don’t slip and fall into an expensive school and intensive major. You make that decision. I wanted to go to school for architecture or engineering (and could have), but I chose to miss out on those opportunities so I could finish in 4 years with reasonable debt. You should know some majors/schools have more time for work than others, and you will graduate with more debt at some than others. If you choose to take a hard major at an expensive school (more power to you), understand that you’ll have more debt.  
  
Here’s a scenario for your consideration. Someone takes 4 years and dedicates them to sculpting the perfect body. He works out 8 hours a day, spends the rest of his time cooking healthy meals and researching fitness. He’s so busy improving himself physically that he doesn’t work, takes out a loan to cover his living expenses. At the end of the 4 years, he has improved his future drastically. He’s able to do more things because of how fit he is, opportunities he couldn’t have before. Do you not think he should have to pay back the loans covering his living expenses, workout equipment, supplements, health food, etc. over the 4 years?  
  
I would show that trump supporter numbers. Here’s how much my tuition and books were. Here were my living expenses. Here’s what I was making. As you can see, the 20k I made covered the living expenses. The tuition and book costs of 25k (100k/4 years) is what I had to take loans out for. I think it is because panel shows are more of an established thing in the UK than US, so they all have practice.So are they together or not? Because Lovett always jokes about how alone he is, and I'm not sure how that can be the case if they're ""Golf Buddies"".

Ah okay, they are involved romantically. It's weird how they tiptoe around it so much, and even weirder how he's portraying himself as "pundit + Lovett vs. singledom". He's attractive and hilarious, any man would be lucky to have him. I laughed twiceThey’re together but they are long distance since Ronan is based in NY and Jon is in LA so I’m guessing there’s where some of the pseudo singledom comes from? Like he doesn’t have a person to bring with him to parties and such. In a podcast with Norman Lear, Lovett mentioned having a partner of six years which I think makes him actually in the longest relationship of any of the PSA-people but I also think Lovett is a relatively private guy who enjoys self-deprecating humor even if it isn't his own self it turns out he's deprecating. Ah okay! I totally forgot they didn't live in the same place. A somewhat bored deep dive through Ronan's Instagram revealed that Pundit was (probably) originally named Paper and lived on Mia's farm before relocating to Los Angeles. They are indeed half siblings.

The "Pundit used to be named Paper" conspiracy theory is based on: Pundit arriving to Los Angeles as a fully-grown dog instead of as a puppy, Mia's Instagram no longer having a dog named Paper in it, and a sense of whimsy. Wouldn't it be slightly funny if Lovett decided the 2016 election was so depressing he'd take a dog from Mia Farrow. I want to hear them roast Pete Hoekstra so bad.Oh man... I've read SO MANY bad takes on the Aziz story... I don't know if I can bring myself to listen to this in case it's yet another bad take.Ok. That does make me feel better. Because the thing that has been frustrating me the most is that people are so caught up trying to like... debate over how wrong his actions were that the larger point is missed. And the larger point, imo, is how this is basically a prime example of the realities of rape culture. Rape culture is when men dgaf whether their sexual partners are enjoying themselves because all that matters are their own desires. Rape culture is trying to turn a 'no' into a 'fine, I guess'.Pod Save Dan’s Wife From Having to Listen to His RantsHe goes on rants similar to me and I appreciate him for it.If it prevents you from skipping forward, the advertisers have succeeded.The NYTimes reported estimates that they make about $50,000 in ad revenue per episode of PSA (I assume its less for PSTW/LIOLI and the other pods) so something is working. 

The ads are memorable and don't make you (general you, obviously doesn't work for everyone) actively hate the products, you feel less like a consumer and more like someone in on the joke. Not sure if he mentioned this in the episode but Louis was on Jeopardy a couple years ago and become a sort of short-lived viral video when he snapped his fingers at winning the daily double: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYkB5f1X-yM&amp;t=0m17sLooking for two tickets, possibly three if you have them, to PSA Live in LA. DM me!Late to this but this is the funniest episode in a long time. I was getting a bit sick of all be live episodes but the whole European tour has been great.[Question] has Pod Save America (or Pod Save the World) had someone on to talk about the Dreamers in regards to to current shutdown-DACA politics?

I feel there was one talking about it but I forgot. I want to send a email to ask them to include people working on this if they're going to spend so much time talking/ranting about it. *specifically folks who are national organizers on the DREAM Act and on the front lines fighting for it *In the most recent episode they included "we haven't told enough of their stories" because that's what convinced people. Erika Andiola would be great 
Awesome I'm still listening lol. I just feel they give so many strategy statements but don't have the lead organizers for the DREAM Act in them. And those organizers and posting constantly on Facebook and have action items that are never covered on the Pod. As well sometimes they have slightly differing opinions which I'd love to see fleshed outThe metaphor I've come up with is a tug-of-war. Dems readjusted their grip so they have a better hold on the rope, but in the process they were dragged a few inches closer to the line. You could look at it positively or negatively in that regard.it is CHIP

CHiPs was a TV show in the 70s, the "i" stands for "insurance" and should be capitalized I think there is a charitable interpretation that by clearing away CHIP and extracting a direct promise from McConnell, Schumer was able to shore up the ranks within the Democratic caucus--I think it is definitely possible that the impetus for ending the shutdown came from wavering Senate dems who assumed the funding bill would not make it through the House. *If* this is correct, the Dems are in a better position in three weeks.

That said, I can see where activists are a bit peeved, and I could just be making an elaborate rationalization.I actually agree with both of you, they are valid points. There's a lot of grey area in trying to evaluate this kind of tactical choice. We will have to continue to pressure our reps and wait and see what happens in 3 weeks.This is probably true, but as a Californian I think it is a GOOD thing that they are acting according to the will of their progressive constituents. I don't think your observation should be considered cynical criticism.I live in a purple district that's on the map for a big fight in cali in 2018 and I don't think this is the case. Just last weekend millions of progressives marched in solidarity and resistance, including my district.

That said, I don't know if this tactical choice is really that bad. We will see.Ira: "[Omarosa] signed with the American Program Bureau so she can start giving $50,000 speeches --"

Louis: "ON *WHAT?*"I could not understand this comment It's super comforting to know that Kushner is responsible for a larger chunk of US foreign policy and diplomacy than the actual SoS when he's as qualified and competent as a coconut. 

But honestly this episode was suuper fascinating. Upsetting, but fascinating. Important Lucca update from the end of the episode: She had a little stomach bug this week! Poor pupper! ;_;PSA is *super* popular among staffers and campaign workers and volunteers.I really want Lovett to know that his banshee scream made my infant niece cry (of whom I was babysitting) and that he should never make that noise again. YES.

Bring in leftist activists! Bring in more leftist policy people! One my favourite episodes of With Friends Like These was the one with Tim Faust (I won’t get into who he’s associated with). The discussion he had with Ana rocked so hard. Now if she can just boot Rick Wilson...

I can understand the need to feel like they have to bring in Never Trump Republicans but I also understand why kids get angry when their parents tell them “No more television for the rest of the day”.  It’s exhausting to have to prove why these people are wrong to associate with. 

It’s upsetting because I really like Crooked Media and I feel like they can do so much more. I’m sure Lovett doesn’t really care for Miller either (apparently he has blocked Tim several times) but still, having him associated with your company reeks of complacency. You are absolutely right. I wish they would let Tim go. And I wish Ana would stop having Rick Wilson on her podcast, too. I disagree with a lot of this, mostly because she constantly harps on trying to understand people and that, if you're white, whiteness clouds every sense of your existence. I hear that.

I do agree that she talks over her interviewees *constantly* and it drives me up a wall. I think Ana in general is great, but it's really annoying when you speak over your interviewee and they're a person of colour, black, or even a white woman also. Also I wish she would kick Rick Wilson to the curb.I think most of this is true and I wish I read it before I made my comment. I feel like they're restrained by their sponsors, and while I'm glad they're making money off of this (it helps keep it free so I can listen to it), if they had more time to put into their podcasts I think their quality would skyrocket. It's not as if they're particularly dry pods either, I can listen to PSA for two hours if I wanted to.Can they just have Ijeoma on every episode from now on? She's great.I mostly agree with this. But I’m wary of any republicans as I believe there isn’t such a thing as a moderate republican. &gt; FFS, why can't we just figure out a way to make more government programs trend closer to paying for themselves? Obamacare tried to put in milestones and incentives for companies that would make it budget friendly and less of an albatross. But as those got cut out, it became unwieldy. 

This is very inaccurate. Obamacare actually did more than just pay for itself - it [reduced the deficit by 143 billion](https://www.thebalance.com/cbo-report-obamacare-3305627). Honestly, it would have been better policy if that surplus money had been spent increasing subsidies, or put into reinsurance funds, or given to states to pay for a larger portion of medicaid spending.

The pattern follows with other Obama era programs too. The cap and trade bill would have actually reduced the deficit. If preventing global catastrophe isn't worth deficit spending during a period of low interest rates and high unemployment, I don't know what is.

I'd highly recommend reading [this piece by Matt Yglesias](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/5/16730978/deficits-tax-bill-democrats-reagan). There are circumstances were concern about debt make sense. And there's nothing wrong with programs paying for themselves, if the pay-fors are good policy. But the hyper-concern over debt above all other issues is not sound economic policy.Well sure, stupid spending is, by definition, bad. But that's a different issue. To your initial point, Dems have already figured out how to make programs pay for themselves, and it hasn't led to GOP buy-in or better policy outcomes. 

Since we're talking about the merits of giving conservatives a voice on PSA, how about [this article from conservative columnist Ross Douthat](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/opinion/confessions-of-a-columnist.html), who recently apologized for his mistaken focus on debt during the Bush and Obama years:

&gt;... a rich and powerful country with a stable government and control over its own currency (which is to say, not a prisoner of the euro) should be willing to live with a loose fiscal policy when wage growth is disappointing and inflation low, and it should debate tax and spending changes on their own terms — will this money be put to good use? — rather than pursuing a balanced budget for its own sake.

That, I think, is the key. Stupid spending is bad not because it raises the deficit, but because it's putting money to bad use. Even if Obamacare really did raise the deficit, that would have been fine if it meant fewer people were dying, and that matters a whole lot more than a number on a computer somewhere. There's obviously a limit, but [Nobel winning economists like Paul Krugman say](https://www.vox.com/2017/12/14/16756872/paul-krugman-economics-policy-ezra-klein) "It turns out that advanced countries, politically stable countries, have a tremendous amount of leeway on debt. We are nowhere close to anything that looks like a red line. If there's something we ought to be doing, we shouldn’t let the deficit impact deter us from doing it."

MMT theorists like Stephanie Kelton [go even further](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-kelton-pony-for-all-20170929-story.html), and that should be the debate - how much deficit spending should we do, and to what purpose should it go to. 

edit: a few wordsYea that's certainly something we can agree on. The GOP does not actually care about the deficit or being fiscally conservative.

I think the point of the Yglesias article linked above is that the Republicans are actually right not to care, both substantively and in terms of the politics of the issue. Frasier is arguably the best American multicam sitcom [edit: forgot Seinfeld], but it is *very* multicam and seems super corny if you are used to single cam shows. And it was kind of dated even towards the end of its run--as a comparison, it ended in 2004 and Arrested Development started in 2003.You should listen to the With Friends Like These with Tim Faust on it. He traces the history of health insurance, from Otto von Bismarck on. No conflation of UHC and single payer from that leftist activist.I try not to go into what I think of the people Tim is associated with because I'd rather not get a hatestorm, but Tim himself is awesome. That episode itself is really cool.If bios are to be taken somewhat literally, it says it on Tim's bio on the website.

Honestly, Tim doesn't really get brought up in that many episodes so I guess it's *fine*, but when shit hits the fan Tim will crawl right back to making sure everything the Democrats fought for will be for nothing.LOVETT IS AN ANGEL!!!It was towards the end when they were reading Courtland Sykes's (MO Senate Candidate) misogynistic misunderstanding of the modern feminist movement. The discussion starts around 50 minutes into the pod.  Multicams are a lot cheaper and quicker to produce, and because they are basically filmed stage productions if someone is a writer or director with a really strong vision they would probably find multicam limiting. Like if you look at *Scrubs*, a solid half of the jokes are sight gags that would be impossible with multicam. So multicam has a bit of a reputation of being the show format you use when you are making schlocky, uncreatve stuff.

It's not entirely fair, almost all the classic BBC sitcoms were multicam, but also generally the period when multicam was dominant was when American shows were garbage (~late 60s through the 90s).Haha even Lovett gets nervous. That is actually weirdly comforting.Lovett nailed it. They all did, but the Ted Cruz mini-rant was brilliant. Terrified? I didn't think so at all. He's been there a couple of times before and on other talk shows and seemed completely fine, not to mention hosts his own live show obviously. Unless you mean terrified in response specifically to the speech. I love following a Lovett tangent...I kinda wish Lovett or Leave It skipped the games and guests and just started after two glasses of wine and a look at the days headlines...I'd listen to THAT daily...Take notes Lovett, I’d listen the shit out of a spin-off podcast just for rantsLovett was Obama's primary joke writer in his first term before leaving to create ***1600 Penn***.  In his 2012 SOTU, Obama made a joke about an arcane law that classified milk as an oil saying that it was a valid reason to cry over spilled milk. The joke was well received as a silly dad-joke and Lovett did not write it.  I'm glad Dan and Jon were the ones to field this one, I really like getting the inside details of why speech writing and coverage is the way it is. Like, after they explained it I definitely understand why eg WaPo had that headline about "Bipartisanship" being the theme of the speech.As someone who is quite hard left myself, the idea that econmic class is a "lifestyle" is pretty ridiculous. That's a dogwhistle via bullhorn.I used to get a bit annoyed at the fact that Dan was very rarely included in the press stuff like late night appearances, but at this point I actually like it. I like Dan’s eps and the other three equally but for different purposes; on the Monday Pod you know you’re getting an entertaining and most likely upbeat rundown of events and the guys’ takes etc. Then on the Thursday you know you’re getting a more relaxed and probably more in depth discussion (where Fav’s opinions can breathe a bit more, they tend to get lost among Lovett and sometimes Tommy on the Monday Pod imo). So I think having the Monday three do the late show stuff now is actually for the best because it best represents that part of the show and the Thursday vibe might not work as well. At least that’s sorta how I see it. I just find Rick Wilson disingenuous and insecure because if it were any other Republican in the seat of the president I feel as if he’d be totally okay with it. Which sucks, because as irritating as I can find Ana to be, I do like her. 

I understand the point of her show, truly, but idk. I feel like there are better people to associate with. I haven’t listened yet, but to be fair most international relations experts tend to be like that. I’m glad that this episode seems to go against that however. Looking for tickets to the PSA show on 2/3. Let me know if you've got some!Please tell me everyone got a gift card anyway. God damnit Lovett lolalso I hope they continue having more time for the rant wheel because this one was *gold*.I was *this* close to giving *Adam Ruins Everything* a shot, but then he had to go on that god-awful rant about Elon Musk.I had no idea–I went on last week and they were completely sold out.  But I just went on now and I snagged a solo ticket too!I AM CACKLING.Lol that was such a bad promise Ah crap I forgot about that. Good to know. This one was especially good. Really? I think that was a really good rant. Not only that but people forget that Elon Musk abused his ex-wife and also sent an email to his employees late last year telling them to be “thick-skinned” regarding racial harassment. 

Adam’s rant was on point also. LA has a massive traffic problem and opening up roads underground *will not fix anything*.Hey, I see me!“They don’t tolerate this shit at Who Wants to be a Millionaire! They’ll break your legs!”

Favourite moment. I mean, I would prefer them doing that, but I don’t care about them making fun of Hannity. I can understand the arguments around the ableism though. That's too bad. It must be a mixing issue. [Here's a clip I took of him playing from the show, sounded fantastic to me.](https://vimeo.com/254438298)I can understand the sentiment. I still listen to it for guests like Ijeoma Oluo, but I can understand why you wouldn’t want to listen anymore. &gt;Losing public option wasn't Obama's fault, and he pushed for it.

He may not have gotten it no matter what, but he also didn't push for it very hard. At the time, Ezra Klein (not exactly a huge Obama critic), [called](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/02/a_failure_of_white_house_leade.html) Obama's actions on the Public Option "*a complete and utter failure of White House leadership. They need to give this effort their support, or they need to kill it by publicly stating their opposition. But they can't simply wait for someone else to make the decision for them, which has been their strategy until now.*"To be fair, USoC is not explicitly against single-payer. But it's not hard to read between the lines. They don't even have the courage to use the broader term "universal coverage" for fear of being "[too polarizing](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20180206/BLOG/180209937)" - that's how far to the right they're starting the terms of debate. 

Andy Slavitt did a lot of good work defending the ACA, but this group doesn't look promising. The website is like a parody of the consultant talk that the guys on PSA mock regularly. It says very little and is completely unoffensive. Which is obviously the point, but I don't see how it'll help reach the goal of health justice.

I'm seeing a lot of people arguing that single payer takes time and we can't rush into it. I agree. Which is why we have to start working on it now. [That's what think tanks like this should be doing](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/29/16196608/wonks-single-payer). Obviously it has no chance to pass until 2021, but it's a huge undertaking that needs serious planning. After all of the likely 2020 contenders (aside from Biden) came out for M4A, this group seems like it's a step in the wrong direction. Yea totally. I have both tactical and ideological differences with Obama, but I think he was acting in good faith. I bring it up because I hope we learn from his mistakes. Democrats need to lead on this issue, and not fall into the wishy washy trap that this new group does. &gt;the group doesn't want to rush to single payer without thoroughly figuring out how to implement and pay for it.

Groups like this *exist* to thoroughly figure out/implement policy ideas. If they wanted, they could focus on single payer, because it's a huge undertaking that could honestly use help from any well funded healthcare think tank. But instead they won't even use the term "universal coverage" (even in a public/private hybrid context), which makes it feel extremely unambitious. Yea while I'm well to the left of PSA, I've got to give them credit for pushing the dems to fight hard on things like DACA. And I know they've definitely criticized this sort of thing on past pods (and Ady Barkan brought it up well in his interview). lol what ideological purity of the tea party. they're united behind racial animus and cult of personality, not any real policy or core beliefs. The Tea Party's core belief was to yell about the national debt and what are the GOP doing about it now? 

Its harder to unite a party around reasonable debate and actual concerns than racism but we shouldn't take a page out of their hypocritical bookRunning for what you think? &gt; Fine, get bogged down in the semantics of a single word.

It is not "semantics", there is [a real substantive difference](http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/91/8/13-125450/en/) between "access" and "coverage".&gt; Established, sweeping systems don’t get gutted.

The fact that all of the Republican attacks on the ACA have been, effectively, from the left, is enormously significant. Nobody ran campaigns promising to allow insurance companies to give less complete coverage or on reducing federal subsidies, they ran on healthcare being unaffordable.They've all (at least the 3 on the Monday pod) explicitly come out for single payer and I'm sure they understand what that means. This new group isn't just against single payer, but also refuses to use the words "universal coverage" (which as you point out doesn't necessarily mean SP). Would he even be old enough hahaHoly shit!Thinking back it wouldn't make sense to think he's 30 cuz his speech writing history but I thought 29-30When Sanders' M4A bill came out Favs explicitly said he supported it, considering it as a starting point for the debate. But this new group is not only anti-SP, it's also anti-UHC. They refused to use the word "universal" because it was too "[polarizing](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20180206/BLOG/180209937)". People can disagree on the right way to get to universal coverage (I think a federal single payer is by far the best way), but not even having the courage to support the broad concept of universal coverage is unacceptable IMO. &gt;This organization may not support Sanders’s bill, but it doesn’t mean they don’t support H4A/SP completely. 

But look at what the group actually says. It's not just that they don't support that specific bill, it's not that they don't support single payer, it's that they don't even support universal coverage. This isn't a Sanders issue. No matter what wing of the Democratic party you're on, universal coverage should be non-negotiable (with disagreements on how to get there of course). This organization is just a bunch of focus-grouped, consultant heavy BS that usually would be made fun of by the PSA crew. These are all issues that are solvable with the help of health policy think tanks, which is why it's frustrating that a well funded org like this one is not helping do the work.

&gt; Has any of the MfA initiatives provided a plan to combat the job displacement of the healthcare insurance industry? 

Check out [this article](http://peoplespolicyproject.org/2017/09/19/single-payer-myths-redundant-health-administration-workers/), it's a very detailed take on the issue. Does that address your concerns? There's a [follow up article](http://peoplespolicyproject.org/2017/09/21/single-payer-myths-understanding-labor-turnover/) that goes deeper into the weeds on the subject of labor turnover. Long story short, it's a very manageable problem.PSA is a huge platform. They can swing primaries if not general elections even. Taking a stand in support or in opposition of a group or movement is a huge deal. If this group gains momentum at the expense of other movements, then decides that the best thing to do is shore up small segments of the uninsured population and call it a day, we're fucked.Which M4A/single payer advocacy groups is he giving similar exposure?&gt; Why is Medicare for all better than that system?

For what it is worth, Germany and Switzerland have relatively expensive health care systems, the UK's is relatively cheap. Not saying that proves anything, but I have not really seen any good evidence that the sort of reflexive arguments in favor of multipayer ("innovative competition" "capacity to meet diverse needs" etc) actually translates to on the ground benefit. Furthermore, to my mind the path to a single payer system seems a bit more straightforward.

For the downsides you mention, the monopsony pricing strikes me as a bit of a fake problem given that it has not really materialized in single payer systems in a way that even approaches the very real lack of coverage in the current American system. For taxation, there is not really a plausible situation by which the amount of money in taxation in a theoretical single payer system is greater than the amount paid currently in taxation and fees. The amount of money paid in taxes may go up, but that will be easily swallowed by the amount *not* payed in premiums etc--except maybe for the very upper income brackets and, like, don't care.

As for job losses, that strikes me as obviously made in bad faith unless the person making the argument believes that the government should provide some sort of jobs program.&gt;  The Democrats would need, at bare minimum, unified control of government and a super-majority in the Senate to pass any serious healthcare overhaul. 

Eh, it would be pretty straightforward to pass some sort of strong public option through reconciliation. Also the Democrats could just, like, get rid of the filibuster. The idea of needing sixty votes to pass major legislation is very recent, ultimately harmful to progressive interests, and generally kind of dumb. It would kind of suck to have the Republicans pass what they want now, but not as much as the Senate fucking up healthcare in 2010.&gt; How would you make it budget neutral? Genuine question.

Taxes, I guess? I mean in a theoretical Democratic control of three branches the Republican tax plan is basically a free trillion dollars.

Also, the technocratic management of the American healthcare system is bad enough that there are real savings to be gained by doing things like extending CHIP for ten more years and extending medicaid.&gt;Does it mean that they can't be good allies for finding a solution that meets our universal coverage/cost/outcome needs that isn't single payer

This group isn't trying to find solutions for "universal" care, they explicitly said that's too polarizing. To this isn't a SP vs Bismarck model debate, but rather a UHC vs Non-UHC debate. If you can't set a goal of universal coverage, you can't be an ally in the fight for health justice IMOFwiw, Bernie's SP plan is more feasible than the house version, for a number of reasons, including a slower phase in. I think we should focus less on the people and more on the policy. Bernie's no savior, but his bill is a great start, which is why it has the support of every senator considering a 2020 bid. It needs more details before it's implemented, and so that's why groups like this should help flesh it out rather than divert energy away.That's a really good deal considering our current health spending (private and public) tops 3.3 trillion annually. SP would help reduce the % of GDP health spending takes up by offering massive efficiencies and cost savings generated by greater bargaining power.Right, I think we're talking past eachother. Lowering our healthcare costs as a % of GDP is an essential goal. Single payer is a great way to do that. All payer rate setting or the Bismarck model would also help. But single payer would be the simplest, fastest way to reduce costs system wide. Most other industrialized nations have hybrid systems that include single payer like elements that help achieve cost savings.

To put it another way, SP would be reducing total healthcare spending from 3.3 trillion to a bit over 2 trillion, so that right there is a big reduction in the percentage of GDP devoted to healthcare.High transition costs will more than pay off for our economy in the long term because of considerably lower annual costs. We should be ambitious and try big things to reduce the suffering our current health care system is inflicting on people, especially woman, POC, and the broader working class. We should build the most equitable healthcare system we can, one that doesn't penalize people for being sick.

The new jobs for heathcare workers issue is [very manageable](https://peoplespolicyproject.org/2017/09/19/single-payer-myths-redundant-health-administration-workers/). Some specialists would indeed get pay cuts, but many doctors servicing rural areas would get pay increases as well. And fears of a recession seem entirely unfounded.  
And as a counterpoint to your article, "[Yes, I'm Sure I Want Single Payer](https://splinternews.com/yes-im-sure-i-want-single-payer-1798548670)".Absolutely no way. The guys have no time to mod a reddit forum, and frankly they're a lot more witty than that guyTouché. It's still a silly proposition IMOI believe there's a subreddit where you can request control of a sub that has been abandoned, the name escapes me right now but you would need to create a post on thereI think Jon is generally more conservative than Tommy or, certainly, Lovett and to the left of Dan. Lovett clearly, for example, listens to Chapo and sometimes veers off toward socialism whereas I think Favs is oftentimes very enamored of his mainstream Democratic friends and is much more of a DC creature obsessed with the art of dealmaking and wonky solution finding. 

I think this is an unfortunate and ill-advised move on his part because he is largely perceived as the leader of Crooked and PSA and they are the leading voice for a mainstream and unified left at this point. I listen to Chapo a couple of times a month, and their cynicism wears on me (though I love the comedy aspect)... PSA is much more active and hopeful and this is a horrible miscalculation on the part of Jon. It will put off part of their audience or drive them toward disillusionment.Yeah, Ira isn't my cup of tea either... Keep It can be funny, but it gets kind of stale if you happen to enjoy whatever thing they're arbitrarily hating on in the non-newsy segments. Plus, yeah, the politics don't align with mine at all. Erin is def to the left of everyone on Crooked except maybe AMC and Lovett so that is exciting even if she weren't also generally funnier than themI’ve never been a mod either, but I’d be more than willing to help. I could stay on top of making sure discussion threads are up for a podcast or two, and also provide occasional monitoring of content that is posted. Let me know!The main moderator of the sub deleted their account, so the other mods are scrambling to continue their work. I'm interested!I've listened to a couple of episodes (though sometimes fast forward through topics if they don't interest me) and haven't heard him mention Bernie.

Maybe it's something he's said off the pod.Probably soon.

She's in the process of moving to LA. She mentioned she just got a job as a writer for a TV show. So I'm guessing once she's in LA and settled, the pod will start.You kind of have to be following his Twitter, he brings Bernie up periodicallyI’m down to volunteer. I don’t know how much I can do with regards to posting new podcast episode threads but I’ll help keep the subreddit properly taken care of. yeah like in the most recent one where Ira talks about liking Arctic Monkeys and the rest of thr group is like "lol omg how stupid lol" and I'm like "...why?"
Not really, Ira has regularly tweeted things like

[Bernie Sanders is like an Amy Adams Oscar campaign](https://twitter.com/ira/status/956588792407777280)

[Bernie Sanders is a pre-existing condition](https://twitter.com/ira/status/860303530199924736)

[Bernie would've won Artist of the Millennium at the 2002 VMAS](https://twitter.com/ira/status/850436700908134405)

All of these post-date the primary campaign, one of them was less than two weeks ago. The guy doesn't like Bernie Sanders and is vocal about it, I don't think this is a delusion of the mythical "Bernie Bro" so much as a well documented fact. 

This article is very good and fair. Healthcare is inherently political. I've said it before, and I'll say it again - everyone should listen to to [Tim Faust on With Friends Like These](https://crooked.com/podcast/a-brick-through-the-overton-window-w-timothy-faust/). If you're on the center left and just don't get the enthusiasm the Left has for single payer, I think he does a great job of conveying why it's such an important issue.Yea exactly. And Faust is a great for those who think the SP proponents aren't wonky enough, because he can get really deep in the weeds of healthcare policy, without losing sight of the bigger moral element that gets often gets lost in by the wonk-class.I’m iffy on this but that’s just because I’m iffy about any team-up with corporate sponsors, but they do it with their ads already so we’ll see. I hope they post main segments into YouTube like Last Week Tonight does. I doubt they’ll have any ads considering it’s HBO but we’ll seeThis was goldThey are our Limbaugh

Chapo is our Breitbart I kind of wish they would put out one live show and one normal show each week while they do these tours. I love Lovett or Leave It, oftentimes more than PSA itself, but I don't like going weeks without news analysis from these guys while they play at that formatI'm ok with what they're doing now. Their general schedule seems to be one week of live shows and then the rest of the month is studio shows. I agree that the live shows lose a little something, but I think that the PSA guys traveling across the country is good for getting people energized and engaged in different places. So it's a mixed bag.They only had 4 non- live shows out of 9 in January, and have had two in a row now with no end in sightJanuary was a bit of an exception because they went to Europe.

Looking at the tour schedule for the coming months it looks like we'll get 2-3 live pods a month for the next 3 months which is a fine ratio by me.**Synopsis:** Rebecca Carroll (@rebel19) fills in for Ana this week to discuss interracial relationships — and Black Panther —  in the Trump era. Rebecca, whose husband is white, is joined by writer/professor Melissa Febos (@melissafebos) [7:42] and writer/performer Quinta Brunson (@quintabrunson) [47:14] to talk about how everyone’s doing in their own interracial relationships these days, in this very particular moment we’re having in America.this is self evidently not going to work, though, because why would someone so disengaged in American politics that they don't even vote attending the live show of a niche political podcast?

I kind of agree with this... I think they increasingly see themselves less as activists and more as something approximating, like, John Oliver. And I think that a group of guys who, to a one, left politics to move to LA and try and make it as screenwriters, this is worrying. If they want to ride the wave of politics-as-entertainment, I don't begrudge them but something is going to be lost in translation and that is going to hurt them over time.I honestly felt sick to my stomach when Wanda James said her brother had to pick cotton to get time off his prison sentence.

Our prison system is a blight on our country.But again, if you are already interested enough in American politics to be listening to Pod Save America in the first place presumably Pod Save America doesn't need to come to town to get you interested in American politics.Pretty sure zero people would have guessed that would be the Dreamer's question.I understand what you're saying, and I think it's fair. But honestly, if it were 100% like in-studio episodes, I feel like the audience would fall asleep. This was mentioned earlier somewhere, but I believe it's important to harp on this because I've been to live shows, presentations and even podcasts where I agree 100% with the subject matter and love the hosts but the dialogue is... dry/bland, and it's hard to stay engaged.I very much do not like Chapo, and will avoid listening to them - but I like Tim, and I think he does really good work. I will definitely read this article later today certainly.**Best desktop site for streaming the pod that allows you to speed it up?** 

Official website doesn't allow it. I use podbean on android which allows it but the desktop site doesn't :/ Downloading and playing on chromebook's media player also doesn't allow it. HelpHonestly if she had ended with the first portion of her overall statement I still would have loved it, but the question itself was specific and I loved it too.art19 seems to work well for most people here, it's the site that's linked in most podcast threads.Same point for reading at a higher speed so long as it doesn't affect comprehension at all. And once you get used to it (I go 1.4-1.7x), then listening at normal speed is painfully slow. It's hard to listen to NPR one nowadays since you can't speed it up **Synopsis:** Democrats push for a vote on DACA. Trump loves a parade and a staff secretary with a history of violence. And Omarosa turns Big Brother into Meet the Press. Live from Denver, Jon is joined by Alyssa Mastromonaco, Adam Cayton-Holland, and Ricardo Baca to break down the week’s news and yes to briefly discuss Trump’s hair and the recent revelations pertaining to it. Fine.
Loved it, very fun, have one major issue.

During 'Okay, Stop', they referenced the Omarosa clip on Big Brother. When they started, he described Omarosa talking to 'Some sort of very sweet-seeming gay person.'

Does Lovett not know who Ross Mathews is? He's a constant on Drag Race. DOES LOVETT NOT WATCH DRAG RACE!? That's the biggest scandal here. You're missing out, Lovett!I mean, I didn’t get that. I can understand wanting a black and/or nonwhite family to raise a black and/or nonwhite child. I don't know, part of the issue with Russia is that there's so much demand for white babies in the United States at the expense of black and non-white orphans who really need homes. I think it's a delicate path to trod and I have seen people do it poorly, but I think it's actually doing a disservice to real human children in service to a wider political point to make any kind of claim like that.Relevance to this sub???I haven’t listened to the episode in a couple of days so I may go off-topic, but I think the main issue is that white people (I want to be clear that this is *generally speaking*, not all) tend to do it to be more saviour-like as well as for tokenism rather than to actually help the kid. Not only that, but white people tend to not understand the actual shit that black and/or nonwhite people go through when it comes to white supremacy. 

I don’t think you’re wrong per se, I would much rather have children without homes have them as well as food to feed them and whatnot. But let’s be honest with ourselves here: it can be irritating when a family goes out of there way to adopt a kid just to use them for tokenism or other reasons not associated with the child’s wellbeing. I won’t be listening to the episode, primarily because CTH is not an entity I want to share my goals with. 

I will say that Favs’ decision (I believe) was not done maliciously, albeit incredibly freaking silly. But that’s all to be said about that. 

Also with that said, this sub isn’t CTH. If you’d like to talk shit on Favs, be my guest. There are lots of things that he deserves to be criticised for, as well as CM in general. But don’t use CTH posts here as an avenue for it. I don’t think it was done maliciously. I will say that it was done idiotically and haphazardly. 

Tim Faust’s criticism of the “movement” in his piece for Splinternews I will say was *excellent*. I didn’t say don’t hold Favs accountable for his idiotic decision to put his name behind a movement that goes against (or, at best, doesn’t say what it supports at all) what he has repeatedly stated he’s for. Faust is great, his analysis is excellent. CTH is not great and repeatedly does not have thoughtful analysis. None of this was obvious by the OP. It was just s link to another podcast. If OP was posting this in good faith and not just trying to stir up shit, they should have submitted a text post that included a link to the podcast as well as a brief summary of what was discussed and the time stamp of the discussion. The way this was posted just seems like it was done to stir shit and cause division. Not only that, but they're mostly already rich as fuck... Will's dad is a fucking New Yorker editor, Felix grew up in the same neighborhood in Chicago that the Obamas live in. They all went to expensive private liberal arts colleges and all three of the main hosts were working as paid comedians and journalists before starting the podcast. They also have a book deal.

I think Chapo is an amazing comedy podcast, it's really hilarious and I love nothing more than listening to their riffs on Elon Musk's rockabilly Mars colony or Jim Davis writing Garfield as a Syrian refugee cucking Jon Arbuckle. But the actual depth of their political messaging is incredibly shallow and boils down to cynicism of an almost "lol who cares when ur this woke u kno voting is 4 suckerz" message which helps nobody.
 the CTH guys make mid-6 figures a year off of Patreon and mostly came from rich families. They're not the scrappy underdogs they want to present themselves as. I actually listen to Chapo on a semi regular basis and know Amber's story. 

I also know Amber is:

A.) a complete fucking idiot who is the progenitor of the abysmal "KLANSMEN ARE VICTIMS OF CAPITALISM WE NEED SOLIDARITY WITH THEM OVER LANYARD DICK LIBS" hot takes you see on the Chapo sub periodically 

B.) perhaps for that very reason, not even remotely a full time co-host of the podcast and barely features even in the episodes she appears in. Really? Here's Will's dad: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Menaker

BTW, prior to Chapo Will coincidentally had a job with Random House, where his father was an editor. Weeeeird.

Here's Felix discussing growing up in Hyde Park, a tony as fuck Chicago neighborhood:

https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/chapo-trap-house-interview-felix-biederman-dirtbag-left-podcast/Content?oid=29354373

Here's a breakdown of the three colleges attended by the main hosts... Carroll College, the University of St. Thomas, Skidmore College. All expensive private schools:

https://psmag.com/news/the-radical-cheek-of-chapo-trap-house

Sorry man, these guys aren't the voice of the proletariat you think they are. They're middle class to wealthy dudes who found socialism via a rejection of their parents liberalism and who were paid to write for HuffPo, New York Mag, and Current Affairs before lucking into a gig that pays them more than the average American salary each month through listener contributions. 

And the best part is, I don't even disagree with them on that much. I'd identify as a Democratic Socialist, I was a DSA member for a minute and a half, I have a Bernie bumper sticker. But you do need to understand who these people actually are. 
[sure they haven't](https://i.redd.it/6t5y7x4hy4yz.png)No, and I don't begrudge people for making money for their work. But I do think that it's rich to play purity politics with your socialism when you're raking in enough money each month to run a middle class Midwestern household.No, but it's fucking asinine to talk about the establishment libs that you're sticking it to when you're a former HuffPo writer from the Upper East Side. These guys are just as establishment as anyone else, just as privileged as anyone else. Their purity politics are the result of having grown up in spaces that afford them the luxury of putting ideology over practicality. 

I don't begrudge Chapo their success nor, again, do I particularly disagree with their politics. But I do think it's ridiculous to act like they're something other than rich, white brocialists whose views are oftentimes substantially influenced by their backgrounds. Just like the PSA hosts are rich, white, ex-frat bros who are hopeless insiders and are oftentimes interested in a narrative (such as protecting Hillary at all costs) over the good of the left.

You're right. I mixed up Will and Felix because I am writing these posts at work. 

I am not saying that being rich invalidates a person's socialism, but I am saying that Chapo's over the top socialist agitprop is at odds with the hosts backgrounds. Matt, fwiw, was afforded the luxury of essentially being unemployed because his wife was a research librarian who made enough money to support them on her own income. So it isn't like he was down and out, he was living in expensive cities like Ann Arbor, MI and DC and doing fine. Also, Felix was paid to write comedy articles which makes him a working comedian in my book. 

The PSA guys have their own problems, which I'm also happy to discuss. If you can't see or discuss the flaws in things you like, you're more myopic and less woke than you believe yourself to be. Am I? I don't think you can really separate the two. I think some of their takes are directly related to the circumstances in which they grew up. I think, in their own way, they are just as guilty of treating politics as sport as the #resistance wannabe Aaron Sorkinites that they dunk on and that is because, when it all comes down to it, the stakes for them are pretty low. It's super easy to say your politics will be all or nothing when the only thing you have to lose is, well, nothing. 

I think Crooked is, bluntly, terrified of discussing the Democratic Party's internal issues because currently they can play to both sides and call it unity. They're concerned with access, and the ability to bring on CPC members to discuss DACA while also interviewing HRC herself is how they've made it so far. 

The unwillingness to engage in matters of Democratic Party politics is a weakness of the show, imo, and something Chapo has done a much better job covering. I remember cringing when they shut down an Erin Ryan joke about What Happened's absurd Bernie passages because they were about to interview Clinton. I would argue that you can support Medicare for All while also wanting to strengthen insurance markets. Here's the thing, principles are wonderful and all, but for someone who needs help NOW, they can't afford to wait the 5-10 years for M4A to become a reality.

I don't think it's a bad thing for people to work on making the Obamacare marketplaces more competitive and stable so that healthcare costs can be lowered for people who need the help now. Providing more immediate relief while at the same time working towards M4A and supporting candidates who want M4A is not necessarily a bad thing.

I think it's very short sighted and actually kind of callous to tell the people who need help now that they just have to deal with it and wait until M4A can become a reality instead of working to give them relief now while at the same time advocating for M4A in the future.The old rule is that anytime a headline ends in a question mark, the answer is no. I have to say, I strongly like Amber pointing out the fucking obvious fact that everyone ignores which is that we don't have a membership based party system in this country. 

God damn is there a stupider talking point in American politics at this point than "herpa derpa he isn't even really a Democrat!" when referring to Sanders, his supporters, or literally anyone on the left who are expected to vote for Democrats at every single election but have no influence on party matters? Note: I do find it increasingly problematic (and quite frankly ironic in every sense of the word) that Trump and the Republicans are trying to undermine them, but that's a different conversation.I get that, I just think we should be careful with how far we go with it because honestly the investigation won't really reveal things we don't already have an idea of. Plus, I don't think it will swing the elections one way or another later this year (more so than what they're projected to look like anyway).Do you mean on PSA or just in general? I don't remember PSA really doing much to put the FBI on a pedestal other than saying they're generally decent people doing a good job (and Mueller and his team are pretty stacked in terms of credentials). in fact, they have gone out of their way - on pods and at live shows - to stress that the Russian investigation is not going to solve the problems, but activism is. In general, yeah, I think a lot of people are so reflexively anti-Trump that they'll cheer for any organization or person that does *anything* against them (see: Jeff Flake), but that's not going to affect much in politics one way or the other. The only way I could see is by people pushing Congress to allow for the FBI to do its job, which in terms of the Russia investigation is a good thing.I'm not saying the guy isn't credentialed. I'm just overtly hesitant about deifying any sort of law enforcement, especially when it comes to the FBI historically speaking.

I do think your final point is perhaps the most important: we need to vote regardless of the outcome of Mueller's investigation.PSA and generally, although I will admit that recently they were like "Yeah the FBI isn't really an all-star bureaucracy" on several episodes. I think that really hyping up Mueller indirectly hypes up the FBI, because he is associated with the organization.THAT'S WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. Thanks for finding that.

I want to be clear that the PSA guys don't seem like too big of FBI apologists, but Mueller isn't some saint and I think it's important to stress that. The daily Mueller news is just kind of irritating.I mean, that's cool but wasn't Bob Mueller the guy who had to be shielded by the Supreme Court from legal liabilities related to illegal detentions of Muslim Americans after 9/11?

Mueller is a Republican who led the mass incarceration state for over a decade. The weird fetishization of his investigation and the transformation of he, and even more bizarrely, Comey are idiotic and seem to point to a group of people so fixated on Trump personally that they are fapping to an ideological enemy so long as he promises to help install... uh, President Mike Pence? 

Basically, this is like the post hoc deification of George W. Bush as anything other than a tragedy of president. The longterm implications are dangerous, even if we should oppose the GOP's stupid memos and support the truth wrt to Trump and Russia coming out. Good take.

Again, this is more generally speaking (though it applies to the PSA guys). But I think it's important to not let this crap be swept under the rug.Not to mention the takes about how "meticulous" and "credentialed" he and his team are. Like yeah, the investigation is important but at the end of the day the best case scenario here is Mike Pence. 

And I think for some people that is fine. I know we're currently going back and forth with the CTH sub in another thread, but there was a sign at the womens march that CTH kind of seized on last year that illustrates this point: "If Hillary Won, We'd Be Having Brunch Now".  And I think that's where it's at for a lot of people, so long as we have a President who *pretends* he isn't a racist, sexist, transphobic manchild, people are happy to go back to ignoring the fray. Maybe they can tut-tut over NPR's headlines on their morning commute, but they are otherwise insulated. For those people, Mueller is a god-emperor who will remove the sole source of their political anxiety and allow them to feel less embarrassed because President "Mulan is Destroying the Youth" won't call a DACA recipient a racial slur on Twitter. Honestly, I do want to avoid brigading or any arguing with any other sub - my problem is that people have short memories and/or are way too privileged to see what's going on. If the shoe were on the other foot, Mueller would not be our friend (I mean, he's not now, but you get the point).(I do agree with you, though)Yeah, this is the other problem with the live shows. I didn't even listen to Lovett or Leave It this week after I figured out that it wouldn't address the aftermath of the government shutdown, I mean what's the point of listening to something that was recorded days ago?So at best he has a mixed record on counterterrorism, a shitty record on mass incarceration of black people, but he's also God incarnate to a certain segment of the left because there's like a 3% chance that he could lead to president Mike Pence for 6 weeks before the 2020 presidential electionSure. Arar was a Canadian citizen who lived in the US for a period in the 1990's. He had befriended another Canadian, Abdullah Almalki. Almalki was in turn friends with yet another Canadian, Ahmed Khadr. Khadr was alleged to be a member of al-Qaeda, the evidence here seems fairly mixed. In any case, the tenuous connection to Khadr was enough for the Canadian government to conclude that both men were likely terrorists, information shared with the FBI. Khadr's son Omar was captured as a child soldier in Afghanistan and was subject to "enhanced interrogation" by Canadian intelligence and the FBI at Guantanamo Bay. During this, let's be honest, torture, the child was coerced into identifying Arar as a man he met in Afghanistan. The coercion was admitted to by an FBI agent present for the interrogation.

Using this information from the FBI, the INS arrested Arar while he was on a layover in New York attempting to return to Canada from a family vacation. When confronted with deportation, Arar requested he be sent back to Canada as he had not visited Syria since the 1980s and had fled the country to avoid military service (he retained citizenship there solely because there is no process to renounce Syrian citizenship). At the time, the Bush administration was resisting implementing sanctions against Syria because they believed that Syrian torture was producing viable intel about al-Qaeda. It is here that Arar argues his civil rights were violated as he was sent to Syria against his protests and in spite of the fact that he was likely to be tortured. In his argument, this was a rendition to allow him to be tortured for intelligence purposes rather than a lawfully conducted deportation.

In the lead up to his deportation to Syria, Arar was questioned repeatedly by FBI officials about his relationship with Almalki without a lawyer as he was not a US citizen. The US government used essentially trumped up evidence of his relationship with Almalki (lying about the presence of Almalki as a co-signer on a lease) to justify their repeated interrogations. Arar was then sent to Syria, immediately detained and tortured for over a year before being cleared by the government and returned to Canada.

The lawsuit was filed against Ashcroft, Mueller, Tom Ridge, and officials within the INS over the lack of due process and violation of the Fifth Amendment as well as the Torture Victims Protection Act. It was dismissed after the Bush administration argued that the lawsuit would harm national security initiatives and involved state secrets. Barack Obama subsequently implemented changes which would not have allowed for such a defense to be used.  

The Canadian government awarded Arar $10.5 million and offered an apology to him. Almalki and Omar Khadr also received similar settlements and compensation from the Canadian government over their torture. No, I was talking about Mike Pence... my contention was that there are people for whom removing Trump has become the sole focus of their politics, the sole reason they're in the streets and the sole reason they're listening to podcasts like this one or CTH. I think a lot of the Mueller fanaticism is driven by people who probably wouldn't be all that activated had we just elected Ted Cruz or Mike Pence directly.No shit. I am very pro Medicare for All. But realistically it’s not happening until at least Trump is gone. And maybe not for a few years after that, unless Dems can get a supermajority in Congress (very unlikely). 

So I think Medicare for All should be the Dem platform but in the meantime, it is not a bad thing to try to stabilize the Obamacare markets to help families who need help RIGHT NOW so they can be insured and get the care they need. I perhaps should have clarified in my initial post for which I apologise, but I still think it’s important so I don’t think it’s “nothing”.You'd think somebody who listens to Chapo religiously would be familiar with the concept of exaggeration for comedic effectI disagree with people that say the show has been going a little downhill as of late, but the interview with Rosen was probably the worst Crooked Media interview I've heard. She doesn't sound ready for primetime. Very cringe.I mean, does it really matter? If you're the one running an organization that's complicit in renditioning someone based on almost no evidence for the express purpose of having them tortured by an autocratic regime at the expense of their human rights and ignoring the fact that they're a citizen of your closest ally... your entire organization is rottenThat's not why they do it. They were asked to do it so that listeners could identify who is who by voice.I would say that they've gotten MORE into political activism as they've grown. As the midterms approach, they're traveling to important states to try to get people excited about getting involved and having local groups be present so that people can get plugged into way to help win elections.

Less in depth commentary, sure. But that's not the same as less political activism.They do it at the beginning of every studio show. It just isn't as obvious because of the lack of audience applause.We're talking about the same Amber who insulted the DSA's disability working group when they (correctly) pointed out that they hadn't been looped in on the M4A plan, right? You must be a real hoot at a partyI should have edited, been up since 3am lolI don’t disagree. “Silly” in the sense of being unwise and ill-thought, not like clown silly.  But yeah, I agree. You're entitled to your whining.  Proceed.medicare for all As a social democrat, I think the authoritarian instincts of socialists are unsavory but also find the mainstream Dems never go far enough. I am betwixt and between and the only group that really represents my views, OurRevolution, doesn't really have this kind of agitprop media arm. Le sigh Good thing we ran Hillary.So what do you tell the people who need help now? “Sorry. Hopefully we can get you healthcare in the next 5 years.”? Or are they just pawns that have to be sacrificed.l? I think that’s a very cold way of looking at things. This isn’t a game. This is def one of the grossest things that came out of the 2016 primary campaign. The idea that you can ascribe collectivist views to every minority and then use that combined with some winking "there must be a reason" rhetoric to imply that everyone to the left of, like, Martin O'Malley is a racist, homophobic, transphobic White Man is so fucking facile and absurd it barely rates discussing. The truth is that HRC and her team were taken aback by their lack of success with younger women and turned to their (relatively) strong numbers with minority groups as a cudgel. Had Bernie campaigned in the South, like at all, numbers probably would have been better with the African American community, but as it stands he won 25% of the vote.  I think about 40% of the posters here listen to Chapo and PSA. Honestly, I agree with the poster on the Chapo sub who says that most Democrats are probably actually SocDems (guilty as charged here)... I go back to something that Matt Yglesias said in a Vox podcast about Hillary Clinton, that in his mind Bernie Sanders represents the views of what some dude who votes straight ticket D every time, but he doesn't represent the views that people expect to hear from a US Senator because the job of a US Senator has traditionally been to tell those people what the actual terms of the debate are. He then talked about young Congressional aides, lanyard types in Chapo parlance, who come to DC starry eyed about the prospect for helping bring about single payer or free college, etc. only to become tools of the machine closed off to those viewpoints. 

There is way more ideological overlap on the left than people tend to think. As a self identifying SocDem, I see the benefits of both the mainstream and the DSA and think that there are ways to blend the two into a coherent message that helps everyone in the US. The political limitations at the time the ACA was passed existed because some Democrats at that time had to be convinced to even support the ACA we got, let alone any of the more progressive ideas being tossed around. A lot of those Democrats have been drummed out of the party, but that doesn't change the fact that the ACA's limitations were self inflicted Cool, stop posting chapo shit in this subredditWell, I love that smell of condescension. There was a PSA where Favs described the idea of starting with something like M4A in order to be negotiated down by the GOP/conservative Dems to a public option or Medicaid4All/Americare as something that never even *occurred* to the Obama admin. 

I was apoplectic. Fucking used car salesmen understand this principal but Barack Obama... the greatest Democratic politician since FDR... never thought to try negotiating from the left and being talked into his real preference I would love to write a long winded response to this but I am on mobile. Suffice to say the semantic difference your are pointing out is wrong because this man and his family were only able to make **their** money ***because of*** the economic system put in place by the **government**, which they have actively worked to change for their benefit. The market doesn't exist in a vacuum. Just because the system gave him all of that money doesn't mean the rules weren't broken as fuck and he shouldn't have been given all of that money. Especially in context of the tax bill. 

In that sense the semantic distinction you are making isn't that useful and is actually confusing the point. Hope that made senseI wouldn't ban it, personally.

but I mean, if the mods wanted to maybe consider what to do with posts that claim that they are about discussion instead of calling people who enjoy PSA morons - that'd be nice. 
Yeah, I think we're on the same page. Your last distinction is an important one that I glossed over in my post.This. Shitty 2006 candidates led directly to the lack of progress which was made in 2008-2011. Matt is from WisconsinI don't think I articulated myself particularly well, as evidenced by the dozens of replies I got to these posts over the past 2 days so let me restate:

I don't question the politics of the three main hosts of Chapo. I don't believe class is necessarily a barrier to socialism and I think some of the dumbest socialists I've ever encountered are old time British Labour Party voters who think that the Prime Minister should be a welder who's barely literate in order to be as authentic to the working class as possible, it's just not realistic. Clement Attlee was about as middle class as it gets.

My critique of the hosts of Chapo has less to do with class purity and more to do with their claimed status as total outsiders who speak truth to the power of the political class. I think people like will and Felix come from insider backgrounds, it's not just about financial privilege it is about who they know and where they've been. It's about questioning whether Chapo really did emerge fully formed from the bowels of weird Twitter and the afterbirth of Bernie Sanders presidential campaign and within 10 months had become the subject of international media attention or whether or not the quick success of the project owes something to the kind of connections one cultivates at New York Magazine or The Huffington Post, the kind of friendships you make at expensive private colleges. I live in an academic community, probably not unlike the one Felix grew up in and one that I know for a fact Matt actually lived in. The children of college professors and University administrators probably comprise a substantial minority of newsroom staffs across the country if my anecdotal experience is anything to go by.

And even beyond that, the injection of money into a group like Chapo actually concerns me much more than the injection of money into a group like PSA. I already know that the Crooked media guys are somewhat compromised. They run consulting firms, one of them serves on Silicon Valley boards, all four of them went directly from DC to California with the aim of making money in Hollywood. I know exactly where they stand... I don't necessarily know what will come from chucking like $200,000 a piece along with book deals and greater media exposure to the Chapo guys and Amber. Bluntly, they already run as far away as possible from being labeled a political podcast whenever they get themselves into any kind of hot water. Perhaps I sound like an Indie music fan terrified that his favorite band is going to sell out, but sometimes bands do sell out.[This sub @ the Chapo sub.](http://media2.giphy.com/media/szPZ2NXIGCMcE/giphy.gif)

For real though, here's the thing. My political leanings are about... Lovett levels of leftist. Maybe slightly more left. HOWEVER, it's annoying as fuck to have people invade this sub just to give people who enjoy PSA shit and act condescending as fuck. And that's what the recent CTH posts have felt like.

And it's really obnoxious.

Just stop it.

I don't care what you do in your own sub, but stop coming here to stir shit and/or feel superior.Pete is my mayor! I love that man Chapo definitely comes at it with a particular voice that basically makes it anathema to anybody who isn't highly familiar with Weird Twitter. Like if you don't think jokes about being gay with your dad are funny, you're not going to enjoy it even if you agree with 100% of the politics.To be fair, Bernie self-identifies as a socialist in spite of the fact that I think most people well versed in the nuance of left-wing politics have identified the fact that his views are Social Democratic.The live shows are really awful, I don't really know how you can enjoy a format that is basically designed as a pep rally for people in the room exclusively. Like having to listen to vapid non answers from a middling Senate candidate while the hosts say absolutely nothing about what they think about the recent government shutdown and what it means for the future of the immigration debate isn't my idea of a fun time

Plus, they're always released at least two days behind meaning that even when they do get topical it's topical two days in the past which inherently defeats the purpose of having two episodes a week... also, since the live shows follow the exact same format as Lovett or Leave It, Crooked Media is essentially putting out 3 hours a week of the exact same content.Honestly, I think that you probably can't expect Bernie to be all that different to someone like Bill Clinton who was almost certainly far more radical as a younger man then he was after 20 years in politics.

I think Bernie is probably a guy who was a socialist when he was younger but who has mellowed into a Social Democrat after spending nearly 30 years in Congress.I think that's a pretty big exaggeration... Bill Clinton volunteer to pick up garbage to get into a closed museum in his early twenties for a date. The museum was closed due to a strike on campus which he had supported, but he was not a labor leader nor was he pledged to a sympathy strike nor was he accepting paid work in place of the striking union... and he was like a 24 year old college student.They have pretty good opinion articlesLatest in-studio episode certainly if you can. I second the suggestion for the end of the year pod for 2017. Also, there has been more activity in the last week or so then there ever has been in this sub. &gt; There were always some lurking creeps from the extremes — supporters of Trump, and supporters of the far-left — whose life goal it is to destroy the Democratic party and liberal values everywhere,

Far Left here, long time member of the sub, AMA about my secret plot to hijack the Democratic party and destroy liberal values. I’m sure the Chapo folks think that I am centrist scum but bloop I voted for Bernie and I even spent months volunteering with his campaign. I support Medicare for All and I think it should be a plank of the Democratic Party. I also believe that money in politics is part of what is killing our democracy and we need to move to publicly funded elections. I think we need to tax the shit out of the rich and make sure that the minimum wage is actually a livable wage. 

But I guess I am indeed centrist scum because I also think that the Chapo folks are so focused on the end goals that they are willing to sacrifice the people who are currently suffering. Using the Medicare for All kerfluffle as an example, I see nothing wrong with having M4A as a goal while at the same time working within existing structures to help people afford insurance.  Because fuck it. People need healthcare now. It’s not good enough to tell the people who need healthcare “we’ll hopefully we can get you M4A in the next decade but if you die before then .... oops?” 

Maybe I take this personally because I have a friend whose mother is probably going to die because she did not have health insurance pre-Obamacare. Her husband was self employed and before the Obamacare marketplace, buying insurance as an individual was even worse than it is now. And he made too much money to qualify for government help. So they just didn’t have insurance. She had some weird symptoms but chalked it up to menopause and didn’t go see a doctor for months until things got really bad because she’d have to pay out of pocket. She finally did see a doctor and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer which at that point was stage 3c. She has been undergoing treatment ever since. She won’t ever be cured but doctors are basically managing the cancer via various chemo cocktails to give her as long a life as possible. She was also fortunate that Obamacare took effect only a couple of months after diagnosis so she was then able to get insurance and not have cancer be a preexisting condition that disqualified her from coverage. 

So yeah. A large part of me wonders if her story would have been different if she had had health insurance. Would she have gone to a doctor sooner? Would the cancer have been caught early enough that she could actually be cured?

Because of the GOPs fuckery people are losing health insurance every day and there are going to be more stories in the same vein as my friend’s mom. And we can’t lose sight of that. That’s why I am all for helping people in the NOW by strengthening the Obamacare markets and lobbying states to expand Medicaid while at the same time supporting candidates who support M4A and making it a Dem Party platform. The Koch's made their family fortune through contracts with Stalin and Literally Hitler and have maintained it through resource extraction, so unless they spend their days squeezing dinosaurs they literally did get their money from the government and public goods.My apologies for my FBI thread the other day - I didn’t think it would be taken over by CTH followers. I agree with this partially. I don’t disagree. I’m not talking about their adoptive parents though, I was speaking generally. It was from "The Fucking Memo", about 29 minutes in.It is very clear who the OP thinks is the enemy. I don't know, I've never posted on the CTH sub and while I will admit I lean farther left then most posters here and listen to Chapo, I think my Reddit presence will attest to the fact that I primarily comment on PSA. 

I think the past few days have been very interesting and much better compared to what this sub used to be like. Like, people are actually discussing individual episodes and general trends within them... it used to be episodes woukd get 4 comments and half of them would just be generic quotes like "we're switching to the cash app!". So be different. Engage. I've read many comments on the Chapo subreddit where people came away with a positive experience in their engagement with PSA fans. Many people are fans of both podcasts, with a preference for one or the other.

You're perpetuating the problem. Also, wouldn't you (rightfully) mock people who were still hung up on Hillary? Fix your username.For what it's worth, it was absolutely "Favstar". It's a twitter joke as indicated:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FavstarSo the only things that make you left are healthcare and immigration, for selfish reasons?

You're on the right for most everything else. How are you different than a Trump supporter? You're trying to use your friend's mom as a prop to indicate to all of us how much more #woke you are and then you randomly insult everyone who supported the candidate you didn't like for no reason even after the person you're responding to said that they voted for him.

I think you need to reevaluate who is coming at the situation in bad faith.You'll never win everyone over. It's that simple. But there's still some substantive discussion here and that's refreshing.

Anyone that foams at the mouth as soon as you mention Bernie isn't worth your time, though.I agree with everything. 

And nah, call it out. That’s an important distinction. Even now people believe in the myth that fat is bad... I have friends who were in elementary school when Atkins took off who insist in believing that things like skim milk are good while avocados are bad because of fat. They really do, at least on this website The discussions from the summer's Obamacare repeal debate were a good primer on how things work in the senate. Although you know the outcome, that now allows you to focus on the discussion rather than on the overwhelming sense of frustration that it could possibly go away.I have been listening to PSA for a while, but haven't visited this sub until recently. It seems that a good portion their viewers also listen to CTH and that the subreddit encompasses both listeners if those podcasts.That is what I'm curious about too. I will primary for the most progressive candidate but vote for any Dem in the general. But can far-left candidates actually start winning races against moderate Republicans?I think we need to be less interested in getting Trump voters and more interested in getting and registering new voters. The racism &amp; conspiracy theory-minded are pretty entrenched in their beliefs.

What works is going to decided by who's elected. A plurality of approaches - what works in the NY 15th is different than someone who lives in the NY 10th, let alone in another city or state, isn't a dick measuring contest. Who's generating the most interest in your district? Who's registering voters in your district? What are they running for Congress because of? What local issues do they think they can solve? 

I don't identify as a moderate Democrat despite how i'm sure people think I am because of my eyerolling at some more "trolling" segments of the people who have staked themselves out as the radical left. 

I think we have cultural amnesia as to how hard people fought against the ACA or exactly how fucking weird and right-wing the country was prior to Obama. Remember freedom fries as like, a joke, but also as like, something that actually happened.  Remember when the ACA was only ever called Obamacare? There are a lot of Americans that are anti-big government. Democrats need to make the argument that government is good by working for people, sure, lets make it. There are wedge issues - like abortion, like gun rights - that the right has dug into for the last thirty years. We aren't getting those people. We shouldn't try. There's more ground to get with unregistered voters, with first time voters, with inactive voters who perhaps had an awakening under Trump. 

I'm trying to spend less time getting mad online. I knock on doors to register people, I do clinic escorting, I donate to candidates I believe in. I like how PSA encourages people to get involved in their local politics. I read Why Civil Resistance Works. We also need to play to movements as well. I can’t seem to find the Twitter thread, but it posited that going hardline socialist at the beginning to try and change everyone’s minds wasn’t good praxis. Essentially, we need to join in on movements that most closely align with being a leftist. This is stuff like “Fight for 15” as well as the universal healthcare debate that currently goes on. 

Tbh, I’m no Chapo podcast fan (if that wasn’t obvious), but I’d be lying if I said Dem leadership in the senate (looking at you Chuck) isn’t great (also Doug Jones’ Trump score is a bit too high for me).

We need to build upon these movements for an actual genuine leftist movement and progress. Also, to answer the question about turning Trump voters:

Honestly, several people here have made it clear that’s not important because it isn’t. What *is* important is finding a platform to run on and to run more left-leaning progressive candidates as well as getting people excited to vote. I think we need to make a case for everyone (everyone wants clean air! everyone wants good schools! everyone wants safety) but there is a not insignificant portion of the right that _wants_ these things but even more doesn't want The Other to get them even more. This is where the example Obamacare vs ACA linguistically comes to play. One is Othered, the other is for people Like Me. 

If incidentally we get some of the conspiracy minded people by making rational, reasoned and empathetic arguments about what we think the country should do: great! But we've also got to cut our losses and realize that there are, in fact, people who would rather suffer so long as The Other is suffering more. The weird thing is that, in my experience, moderate Republicans agree a lot with the Democratic platform. But, they either hesitate because they don't have the basic information on the subject or have preconceived notions of the Democratic politicians.



For example, my boss grew up in a small town, never went to college, and has worked there his entire life. When we discussed 'race' at first, he was believing that everyone is equal and that equity policies were junk. But when I showed him how effective and vital food stamps, universal healthcare, and welfare can be he really changed his perspective. When I fully explained why Colin to a knee he started to shift his opinion.


He isn't some Harvard professor, but he understands people, he understands what it's like to be poor, he understands what it is like to work hard and pay taxes to a seemingly inept government.



If Democrats can get a filibuster proof majority in Congress and get basic legislation passed, I think a lot of moderate will be able to see what a functional government looks like.But these people feel left behind by the government, even if it is because they chose to elect shit Republicans. They will be a constant cancer on the US unless we can shift their mindset.


 I think the biggest failure of the modern civil Rights movements is that there are factual reasons that minorities have struggled to get ahead in the US. But a lot of the people on the outside never see the facts and assume those inside are running on feelings. If they sat down with minorities and talked to them, all the while presenting easy to digest statistics, a lot of them will change their view if only slightlly. 


But we need to shift the middle from alt-right___moderate 
To
Moderate R/D __far-leftWe make the principled argument. But some of these people who feel left behind are making the logical (to them) choice of choosing white nationalism. Etc etc not all Trump voters but enough.

White nationalism is a capitalist belief as well as a social one. We say: undocumented immigrants are lazy and dangerous (except people don't say undocumented) And then we build an entire shadow economy on illegally paying them sub-minimum wage, deporting organizers in the Central Valley, having them as the line cooks in every restaurant. 

You are right that we talk about racism or sexism as feelings instead of systems that function within a capitalist world. There are people who benefit from these systems and will not give them up. They won't, even if they feel left behind by the government BECAUSE they like the benefits of being Better Than. 

We make the case, we make it well. We're capable of that. But there are people who won't be budged by it and I don't want to throw myself against a wall like that again and again when I think we'd have more luck in other avenues. Of course not every Trump voter will be like that but I worry we're going to spend too much time trying to find the difference. I don't think it's been a huge topic on the main PSA show because it hasn't been the biggest issue in politics in the last year. The debates on healthcare, taxes, and immigration have been the biggest things they've talked about because big marquee legislation on those topics have dominated 2017. Plus you have the various special elections and administration scandals that have occurred. There hasn't been too much room in a 60-90 minute show to get to labor rights, unfortunately.

I think Crooked Conversations, Pod Save the People, and Majority 54 (once it comes back) will be better avenues because those tend to delve into a specific issue per show, instead of PSA which is a cover-all-that's-happened mixture.
Unfortunately the labor movement in the US is completely shredded. The last real major labor legislation was the Employee Free Choice Act, which has a legislative history that is absolutely infuriating. More recently, Warren and a few others have made a push to change the NLRA provisions that make right to work laws possible, but it didn't really catch much news and given the fate of the EFCA a healthy skepticism is justified.

From a political standpoint, there are a few democrats like Sherrod Brown who have a strong relationship with labor politics, Randy Bryce has made a lot of hay out of his union organizer past, and Bernie Sanders tended to be both more and less radical on these matters. But by and large, despite Democrats throwing a few rhetorical bones towards labor, the dominant story has been pretty negative, with the Koch network takeover of state governments and the rise of "Uber, but for x". Speaking anecdotally, there are certainly lots of people who feel strongly about these sort of defensive fights, but there doesn't really seem much political imagination for actually improving the situation. The political will in the Democratic Party is for improving the situation of labor via regulatory measures and public welfare programs, which are important but do not really contribute to the empowerment (or rather, de-disimpowerment) of labor.

Which is why I don't really blame the PSA crew for not really ever talking about labor, they are fundamentally news commentators and that stuff isn't really in the news. But I really wish they would and I think it would be great if people started pushing them on it. Just using their platform to let people know how *easy* a lot of fixes are.Mate, as Democrats, the Trump score should not be that high. Jones’ is over 71%. You know whose isn’t? Gillibrand’s, at 7.8%. Now Jones hasn't been in the Senate long but there's no reason to have a score that high 

I’m not saying be ideologically pure. I’m saying don't vote in line with Trump’s agenda 71.8% of the time especially when you campaigned *against it in the first place*.

Edited for spelling and clarification.Again, I mentioned that earlier, but I'll concede to that. His support of the warrantless spy program I have issues with though.

I still think that, with a larger sample, if it's still quite high I would say that's a problem, personally.&gt; I think we have cultural amnesia as to how hard people fought against the ACA or exactly how fucking weird and right-wing the country was prior to Obama.

Despite the Tea Party's branding it was never *actually* against "Big Government". Or rather the *movement* was but the people that actually went to the rallies, protested town halls, etc were not. As Theda Skocpol shows pretty thoroughly, the actual activists were motivated by a combination of cultural/racial animus and a fear of losing their benefits (notice that the "death panel" thing is very much *not* and argument against expanded benefits). This was assisted by the ACA being such a boondoggle of a piece of legislation that there was no real effective messaging. Poll after poll after poll has shown a very broad base of support for universal healthcare, worker protection, affordable education, higher upper income taxes and a whole slew of progressive economic policies. The idea of the anti-big government American population is a smokescreen thrown up by right wing messaging.

Anyway, good progressive legislation generates its own constituency.

From a more historical standpoint, the anti Big Government" American is a very recent phenomenon that was very much helped along by Democrats [abandoning New Deal governing principles](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/29/how-the-democrats-could-win-again-if-they-wanted).Ugh, as a future climate scientist/policymaker I'm bitter towards Manchin, but point taken. I hope the South becomes reformed within the next decade.To be fair to Lovett, I think he's been pretty open about struggling with weight and I think for many people who have disordered eating habits it is healthy to take this kind of all or nothing approach. It is easy to turn a Chipotle lunch into a 1500 calorie nightmare, so conceptualizing it that way may be useful for him. I like Kara? I mean, I can understand why she's overtly negative about a lot of this stuff. I appreciate the viewpoints she brings on. Louis is phenomenal as well, his Twitter exchange with Mirai Nagasu was hilarious.&gt; Common sense labor policies should be taken as read, in respect of the current political agenda.

I'm not really certain what you mean by this. Can you clarify?

I'm also not certain why you think the issues that CM talks about are more "interesting and nuanced" than labor relations, or why all their discussion about, say, healthcare or taxation is less "preaching to the choir" than discussion of labor issues.Agree completely, and I was similarly frustrated when they had Doug Jones and Ralph Northam on before and after their wins. It was clear there guys had been doing the rounds saying these things in the same way all week/month, but the guys didn’t make enough of an effort to extract some actual relatable or human qualities from them. Yep. One of the main reasons I can hardly stand the live shows most of the time (except the Europe ones which were fantastic imo, except London felt mostly the same as the pep rallyish vibes of the US shows). They justify the constant touring by saying that they’re trying to reach out and organise by going to these places. Who the hell is gonna buy a ticket to a Pod Save America show who’s ‘on the fence’ or not already at least mostly left leaning? It’s just a room full of people agreeing with each other. I think it’s because they’re using those headset mics now so they don’t really have the ability to place the mix away from their mouth when they laugh or cough or whatever. Pretty irritating. Yeah, people want a good guy to the villain that is Trump and his establishment so they paint Mueller in ridiculous light. He’s just a guy doing his job. The far-left in my mind are those that are full on socialist/communist. They are primarily those who believe in Karl Marx and his teachings. From what I have seen on here and the CTH subreddit is that they believe Democrats are the reason why this country is in the shitter because they believe the Republicans are using effective strategies. They seem to think that Democrats should not be arbitrators for 'both sides' and use the same GOP strategies except to push through very progressive legislation.The NRA and GOP vow to do nothing about America's 18th school shooting in 35 days, Trump and Republican leaders reject a bipartisan agreement to protect the dreamers, and the Administration is filled with corrupt goons who screw taxpayers and jeopardize national security. Jon and Dan cover another banner day in the Trump Era, and then talk to immigration activist Marisa Franco about how she helped defeat Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and what we can do to change the politics of immigration. Total love for Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza which is as relevant now as it was in 1987.I think we're sadly desensitized to mass shootings. As a country, we've just accepted that it's gonna happen. Which is awful.&gt; Also listed on the organization’s site is an incident from Jan. 20, when at 1 a.m. a man was shot at a sorority event on the campus of Wake Forest University. A week later, as a basketball game was being played at a Michigan high school, someone fired several rounds from a gun in the parking lot. No one was injured, and it was past 8 p.m., well after classes had ended for the day, but Everytown still labeled it a school shooting.

I would argue that WaPo's fact check here is far more misleading than the claim in question. This is the hottest of takes 

9.5/10 stars awarded, beautiful execution, minus half a point for not italicizing book title

/sI haven't listened to this ep but I don't think they record the ads at the same time as the ep. They probably recorded them beforehand in a big batch Because Republicans are shit at governing. The run on anti-abortion, small government, and Christianity. 



But ask yourself, what kind of legislation can they pass? Any legislation that is created by their donors is instantly passed, anything that their supporters want is shelved to be used in the next election cycle. They use populist tactics to get elected, but do nothing to support the people that vote for them. The only reason it works is



As Democrats, we don't want leftist populism. We want actual legislation, real ideas, and to change our countries fundamental ideology. Populism is easy, but it doesn't do shit for the people. Fascist and Communist dictators are elected on populism, not reality. If being real politicians that work for the people means losing some elections, then I'm fine with that. I don't want easy if it means sacrificing real politicians for those who demand for liberal ideals, but don't want to put in the work on crafting legislation. 



Our problem is Dems craft good legislation, GOP obstructs and criticises legislation, then the Dems have to water it down or toss it out EVEN IF THE LEGISLATION IS POPULAR WITH MOST OF THE NATION! But the GOP never comes up with viable fixes to the legislation. For example, Obamacare had issues and the GOP rightly points done of it out, but they never actually fix it or propose viable alternatives.I think a reasonable person might include these:

&gt;But since Everytown began its tracking, it has included these examples — in August 2013, a man shot on a Tennessee high school’s property at 2 a.m.; in December 2014, a man shot in his car late one night and discovered the next day in a Pennsylvania elementary school’s parking lot; in August 2015, a man who climbed atop the roof of an empty Texas school on a Sunday morning and fired sporadically;

under the definition of "school shooting". A reasonable person might also limit the term to refer to mass shootings within school grounds during school hours. Were the WaPo article to be titled "The figure of 18 school shootings in 2018 depends on your definition of 'school shooting'" I would find that reasonable. "No, there haven’t been 18 school shootings in 2018. That number is flat wrong" is very much not.That's a fb live session, of course they'd do the ads live for that. For the studio pods they record them separately, seemingly on a different day, because Lovett appears in the Jon/Dan pod ad reads.Oh, they did the live stream without ads? That's interesting, I thought they would at least tell the stream what the ads wereIt is not the term I would use, but if I read the article I would see that they are defining "school shootings" as "shooting at school". I would not call it *flat wrong*.Found the twitter thread!

https://twitter.com/thucydiplease/status/963193049198182400&gt;I’m really hesitant to support single payer until we resolve the structural problems and rent seeking in American healthcare

I agree with where you're coming from, but I think Single Payer would be the best way to address these structural problems. 

&gt; creates perverse incentives, where pharmaceutical companies and others create marginally useful but extremely expensive drugs because they know Medicare will pay for them no matter what.

Single payer would solve this problem by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices (which is something that could also be done as a standalone change, but Medicare would have less bargaining power in that case). If a drug didn't offer significant benefit to patients, Medicare could simply choose to not cover it. 

&gt;exploiting ourselves for the benefit of these parasitic industries.

This is exactly why we need to change the balance of power in the healthcare system away from the parasitic industries. Our current system, with a diffuse array of insurance providers, gives each provider limited bargaining power against the big drug companies.

I think it's important to remember that while Single Payer is often branded as Medicare-For-All, it's not like we just expand the current Medicare system to cover everyone. It's Improved and Expanded Medicare. If the rich thought that SP would be a massive upward transfer of wealth, they'd probably support it. In practice, single payer would be extremely progressive in terms of its distributional effect. &gt; you need to give me a good reason to uppend all of that that isn't simply 'because it makes me feel good', and so far I haven't seen one.

It's fair to say Single Payer advocates often justify the necessity of SP in relation to our current system rather than a theoretical improved-ACA style system. So here are some reasons why SP would be far preferable to an ACA+Public Option system:


* **It's simpler** - The ACA has personally helped me a lot, but I've also wasted untold number of hours dealing with their website, and that's before even getting to the insurance company, which has every incentive to [deny you care](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ady-barkan-healtnet-breathing-machine_us_5a566911e4b0a300f90559f8). Many people point out the [added monetary cost](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/07/upshot/why-single-payer-health-care-saves-money.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=08735160DD571BB3C02E4663C8393AD8&amp;gwt=pay) our inefficient system adds, but I think we underrate the cost in time that we subject sick people to. Navigating the tangled web of bureaucratic layers just to get care is a tax in itself. Adding a public option, while good, only adds one more program to our fragmented system. To maintain a system with private insurers along with a public option, the public option would have to be designed so as to not out-compete private insurers (or else it would just turn into single-payer). This would force policy makers purposely make the public option less attractive.

* **Doesn't disincentivize work** - This is one area where conservative critics of the ACA have a point. The means-testing element of both Medicaid and ACA subsidies (which would likely be similar to a public option) result in a situation where it doesn't pay to work more in certain cases. God-forbid you work overtime like [this redditor](https://np.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7utw8s/pa_medicaid_case_worker_just_told_me_i_will_be/), and you might have to pay back subsidies. If on the other hand, you have employer based insurance, you have a disincentive to change jobs, even if it would mean a raise or a better fit. Employer-based health insurance is [generally disliked](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/03/upshot/the-illogic-of-employer-sponsored-health-insurance.html) by economists for distorting the labor market in this way, but that wouldn't be fixed by a public option (again, unless it was too attractive, in which case it would collapse the employer-provided health care market).

* **Encourages preventive care** - Co-pays and deductibles are regressive, but a standard part of most universal non-SP health systems. A $50 co-pay doesn't mean anything to someone with the money, but it might prevent a working class person from getting needed care. No matter the system, we all pay more if people get sick (whether through higher insurance premiums or higher taxes), so we'd all be best off to not prevent people from accessing care through monetary barriers. A public option would not eliminate cost sharing (again, if it did, it would kill the rest of the insurance industry).

* **Addresses Costs Most Effectively** - Sarah Kliff at Vox has [great reporting](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/16/16357790/health-care-prices-problem) on the problem of prices in the US health care system. And you can argue this would initially make it harder to implement a single payer program. But it's also why one is desperately needed. ACA reduced the cost end consumers paid, but it did nothing to address the actual unit cost of health care (according to Gerard Anderson of Johns Hopkins, quoted in the above article). All-payer rate setting would be a step in the right direction (though more disruptive and politically challenging than just a public option), but single payer would go much further, not only setting prices, but also providing the greatest bargaining power to drive down prices of both drugs and procedures, as well as eliminating a great deal of administrative cost. A public option would do far less to address the out of control prices in our system.

* **It aligns incentives appropriately** - only a federal single-payer bears the costs of providing care, and the costs of not providing care.  From [Tim Faust](https://tinyletter.com/error/letters/some-thoughts-on-persuading-the-lukewarm-about-universal-single-payer):

 "Right now, your private insurer only bears the costs of you *receiving* care. Because you are likely to change insurers in the future, and eventually go on Medicare, they don't actually feel the pressure to provide you care that keeps you healthy *in the distant (and near) future*. Instead, we all do — we all suffer when our friends and family get sick; our public money is allocated to care for people when they get sick.

 So it makes perfect sense that the same actor who suffers when people *don't* get preventative care — all of us, united, represented by our federal government — should be the actor who also *pays* for that care in the first place."

* **It provides a jumping off point to push for broader health justice**: More from Faust:

 "Because the federal actor bears costs of providing care &amp; not providing care, it can finally be a tool for realizing health justice. If your population is getting sick and dying because they don’t have a place to live, then housing is healthcare, and you build housing to bring healthcare costs down. If your population doesn’t have access to healthy food to eat, then food is healthcare, and you provide them with affordable food options to bring food costs down." 

My question for you would be: what value are insurance companies providing to our system that makes them worth preserving? The ACA made sure that insurance companies couldn't compete by choosing only healthier customers, or by charging sicker customers more. This left market power as the only [dimension on which insurance companies could compete](https://baselinescenario.com/2016/05/09/the-problem-with-obamacare/) (because bigger plans can negotiate lower prices, leaving more room for profit). But that also happens to be a dimension that Single Payer would be far superior at.

Ultimately, a public option would be a great step in the right direction, but it would not come close to the benefits of a federal Single Payer. I appreciated Favs and Dan talking about that - they mentioned this article (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/05/upshot/how-to-reduce-mass-shooting-deaths-experts-say-these-gun-laws-could-help.html) and exactly how popular the beliefs are and how important it is to vote for people who reflect the majority of the country's beliefs. I feel a little guilty for posting this, but I'm a little tired of hearing nearly exclusively about the Dreamers when they have guests on. I'm completely for the Dreamers and I hope they can stay, but there was a House bill this week that passed that would completely gut the ADA if it gets through the Senate and I don't think I've heard one peep about it on any PSA podcast (due to time constraints, I only listen to the main shows, LOLI, and PSTW so maybe someone else mentioned it.) I have a paralyzed brother and I'm completely outraged at what Congress is doing and I wish I could have heard *something* about it on the top liberal podcast out there.&gt; I think the biggest issue here, the biggest riff is that liberals still value things like choice, competition and markets because ultimately the general populace will be the judge of whether or not our products, services, ideas, etc are worth spending their money on - while you do not see value in that. 

You're right that this is a big rift. But even as someone pretty far to the Left, I think that we should simply take it on a case-by-case basis which ownership model is best, from 'free' market, managed competition, to full state control. No model will be best for every single situation.

For example, I think there's general agreement that for computer chip manufacturing, a relatively free market is preferable (setting aside that there is [no such thing as a truly free market](https://www.salon.com/2015/09/29/robert_reich_theres_no_such_thing_as_a_free_market_partner/) without government setting up the preconditions). On the otherhand, when it comes to firefighting, a fully nationalized model is widely agreed to be preferable, funded by taxes and free of end-user fees (though [even that](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/39516346/ns/us_news-life/t/no-pay-no-spray-firefighters-let-home-burn/#.WoexXKjwbIU) is subject to the privatize-everything mindset). Those are the easy cases, but things like education and health care are the contested zones. While there are some leftists who want to nationalize everything, the vast majority of people on the left of the Democratic party are simply arguing that the edge-cases are better served by a greater degree of public ownership and democratic control.

Take health insurance as an example. Obamacare tried very hard to shoe-horn a market structure into an area that we don't necessarily want market forces to determine. I'd highly recommend reading [this article](https://baselinescenario.com/2016/05/09/the-problem-with-obamacare/), which details the issue very clearly. Ultimately, the ACA constrain insurance companies to the point that it's unclear what utility they provide. As an alternative, Single-payer isn't even arguing for full nationalization of the healthcare industry. It's a pragmatic compromise on the part of the Left, recognizing that the nationalization of the health *insurance* industry would be much more feasible than nationalizing providers and drug companies as well. What innovation does the insurance industry provide? What would be lost if you don't get to choose your insurance company, seeing as you'd still be free to choose your doctor?Synopsis: Mueller drops more indictments. Republicans block immigration reform. Another deadly school shooting elicits thoughts and prayers. The Obama portraits scramble some brains. And Laura Ingraham blows a dog whistle wrong because we all can hear it. Roxane Gay, Solomon Georgio, and Amani Al-Khatahbeh join Jon to break down the week's news. Plus, we're soliciting submissions for the official Trump portrait at crooked.com/portraitmode.I feel the same but perhaps for different reasons: I think what’s missing is the fact that the narrative surrounding the Russia investigation has slightly xenophobic tones. Passing sanctions on Russia won’t hurt Putin, it will only demonise and destroy the lives of the citizens of Russia. 

Also, not saying that the Russian government interfering in an election isn’t bad (it is, but also... the USA has been doing that for decades), but it’s not as if they weren’t taking advantage of the current social atmosphere of the country. They were just 500 years too late. 

I wish they would just *drop it entirely*.Really? You don’t think that treating a country’s citizenry as a monolith is a problem?What would economic sanctions do to Russia that their recent economic stability hasn’t already done? And how does this imply that I’m not worried that they’re attacking me?

You see, this attitude is what led to wars and destabilised regions. I’d rather not see economic sanctions that would be leveraged on their citizens more than Putin’s rich ass. 

None of this implies that I’m absolving Putin of wrongdoing. But not like this. Amani Al-Khatahtbeh is a 9/11 truther, so I could do with less from her. Roxanne Gay is great though.Do you know the episode(s)? Was it recent?tbh Roxane went after Michelle Obama and I feel like was generally way to the left of the panel at large. LioLi has a history of editing down people who go too far off message, so it wouldn't surprise me if she had just sort of gone down some roads the pod didn't want to address so she was left on the cutting room floor. 

ETA: I don't think this is because CM are censoring far left guests, I think it's because this is a comedy podcast and they want to keep a consistent banter-y tone. If one person is out in left field and the others don't agree, it can get argue-y. Synopsis: The Department of Justice indicts 13 Russian nationals who conducted information warfare against the United States, Mueller’s charges offer hints about his next move, Trump reacts on Twitter with his characteristic subtlety and cool, and the students of Stoneham Douglas lead a movement to stop mass shootings. Then Jon talks to New York Times writer Zeynup Tufekci about Facebook’s role in the Russia indictments and whether mass shootings are contagious.  I've seen a few live shows, I have merch, I would rather do almost anything than subscribe to anyone's newsletter but more power to them.Yea politician interviews (especially lower level ones) are almost never worth listening to. I wish they'd have more people like Tufekci. They should also give her a Crooked Conversation episode to continue the discussion. I'd like to hear her ideas for changing the Facebook business model more fleshed out. It seemed to me that if the users become the customers, then that would require something like a subscription fee, which I can't see going over well. But it's clear the current model is broken, so I'd love to hear some more ideas. Yea, I definitely think it'd be an uproar and then gradual adjustment. My main concern is that it'd be regressive. Facebook is becoming a essential element of life for many people, and a small membership fee would be a barrier for poor people. Even a tiered model with free basic access and paid enhancements wouldn't be great in my opinion.

I'd be interested in making Facebook a non-profit, free for all to use, still funded by ads the way it is now, but regulated like a utility (since it's a natural monopoly). Vox has been pushing newsletters too (VoxCare is good). Having a big email list is really valuable. The part in this pod where said "the worst thing that ever happened to American democracy was when we started saying 'when they go low we go high'". The Skimm has cultivated a huge following, so they're all chasing that market now. Lol, too lateThat's true, I don't think people will ever be willing to pay as much as their data is worth. I'm all for pie-in-the-sky thinking, but paywalled facebook doesn't seem like a great outcome. 

I think treating facebook as a public utility would be ideal. Facebook is way more entrenched than MySpace ever was, and network effects ensure competition has little chance (and Facebook can just buy up anything like Instagram that gets close - that's where more aggressive anti-trust enforcement should come in).Yea absolutely. They could always make an exception for those types of institutions (they recently [dropped fundraising fees](https://qz.com/1141658/facebook-is-dropping-its-fundraising-fees-for-non-profits-but-not-for-personal-causes/) for non-profits), but ultimately it just seems like a bad idea to paywall it, and it's unclear how that would even be accomplished. Regulating it like a utility, on the other hand, at least has a precedent that you could follow, though it'd still be a challenging political and practical effort.&gt;I’d like the quants to go back to weapons development. At least then we knew they were trying to kill us all

Haha, I think humanity's best shot for survival is having the quants all go back to Baseball analytics. I understand the reasons. But if my fiancée came up to me and asked for me to sign up for her newsletter, I would pretend to not be able to read. Listen to Ezra Kleins newest podcast from this week. It's an interview with a former google employee and specifically about this issue. Goes a lot more in depth than PSA did.I do find Lovett funny most of the time but it sort of bothers me how Favreau and Tommy absolutely lose it laughing whenever he does something for a laugh. I mean, he’s definitely funny but it seems like they over do it sometimes. I think it’s more just lack of Dan love rather than actual hate. He doesn’t get as much attention or discussion as the Monday 3. Seeing so many young people, many of whom can not even vote yet, stand up and take charge and, not only be a part of the conversation, but LEAD the conversation is incredible. What did I do in high school? I can't even remember anymore because it was clearly not this important. Gen Z is here and they aren't waiting their turn! Those kids are so good. I'm not necessarily opposed to more conservative voices (though I do doubt it'd be constructive), but Ben Shapiro is way to irredeemably [racist](https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/25712847277) to give a larger platform.Yea, a larger focus on unions would be great. Do you remember who it was they had on before? I don't remember that one.Hard agree.I'd like to see Stephanie Kelton on to talk about Modern Monetary Theory.Yea, I see where you're coming from, but one of the main things he's know for is YouTube videos with titles like "Ben Shapiro DESTROYS dumb libs" - his fans are very used to hearing new perspectives (for the purpose of 'destroying' them). I think the confrontation can even deepen the tribalism. That being said, I'd totally listen to it. But I'd be genuinely surprised if any minds were changed. Ben Shapiro got into a Twitter fight with Lovett comparing gay marriage to incest a few years back. He's pretty awful. The thing that makes this podcast great is that it feels honest. Like Lovett isn't ranting to push a DNC point, he is truly pissed off. They guys don't try and find the 'moderate' solution, they want to achieve the best solution. 


Especially when CNN and somewhat MSNBC want to appeal to 'both sides', even if that means putting Republican idiots on television. Traditional Media companies cave to moderates while Fox appeals more to the alt-right. It is almost analogous to our current Congress. Paulette seems really great. Not everyday you see some who has endorsements from both DSA and Cher.California has a top-2 primary system. Republican and Democratic candidates are counted together, and the top 2 vote-getters move on. Thus you could have this situation:

Republican A- 20%

Republican B- 20%

Democrat A- 15%

Democrat B- 15%

Democrat C- 15%

All other Democrats- 15%

Republicans made up 40% of the electorate, but the Democratic vote was so split that the top 2 winners were Republicans, and they are the two on the ballot in November. This is rare, but it's more likely in an open district, like Darrell Issa's where you have competitive primaries on both sides.

On the other hand, this allows for a situation like 2016 where two Democrats faced off in the senate race.I support it for primaries, certainly.holy shit yes I've been complaining about this for monthsLOUDER FOR THOSE IN THE BACK.

IT NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM.The media establishment variety of centrism (low taxes but with gender neutral bathrooms) is only shared by like 1% of the population There a political scientist (Chris Skovron I believe) who modeled district-level support of typical "liberal" policies and climate policies received quite a bit of support even in DCCC target districts. The fact that they're not campaigning on them is foolish.Ben Shapiro, bringing together the Left and Center-Left. He's truly a bear of a man.Shout out SBI deleted the tweet but took a screen shot of it for my reference and to use later ongod, why is this sub so allergic to actual discussion?

Yea, despite all the chatter about "campus PC police", [corporations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/corporations-are-cracking-down-on-free-speech-inside-the-office--and-out/2017/08/10/6a98809a-7baf-11e7-a669-b400c5c7e1cc_story.html?utm_term=.d9b2116f37b0) and [the Right](https://splinternews.com/the-real-threat-to-campus-free-speech-is-here-1822628422) are the real threat to free speech.I always recommend using UPS (for larger packages) and USPS (for packages under 10 lbs), as both are unionized, and just generally better all around.This certainly wouldn't be a high priority for me, but I think it's a great idea. The more young people vote the better, both for democracy as a whole, and for the Left in particular. We need a countervailing force against gerrymandering and voter suppression. Synopsis: Young people change the gun debate in a matter of days. NRA talking points ring hollow at a CNN town hall. Black Panther helps register voters. And Jon demands a gay superhero. A guy with laser eyes and a boyfriend. What’s the problem? Mayor Michael Tubbs of Stockton, Black Lives Matter activist Alicia Garza, and comedian Jenny Yang join Jon in Sacramento to break down the week’s news and mock Marco Rubio because he deserves it.

Yep. They kept mentioning on twitter and in the interview itself that it's unfortunate Lovett isn't there because I guess he and Billy would have great chemistry, so they shopped him into the thumbnail. The mispronunciation of Saoirse Ronan’s name made me cringe lolThat was without a doubt the dumbest comment I've ever heard on a Lovett show. I'm surprised it didn't get cut.to be fair, the Irish (and Welsh, Scottish and even the English!!!) all spell things in absurd waysNot a big fan of the logo. Yellow blends in with the white too muchMy guess is the recent news is actually why that company didn't have any jokes in their ad this month. Whoever writes their ad copy is not stupid.I mean, was it?

It's literally a line from the movie...Let's be honest here: the United States' history is built on violence and subjugation, all from colonialism.

Her "ban men!" comment was speaking *generally*, not *literally*. I can't believe I have to say this on the CM subreddit.Lovett or leave it is always live...lol i want to curate a list of existing gay superheroes for Lovett for him to read.Former 16 year old here as well. You'd be hard pressed to find a bunch of kids marching for abortion and school prayer. And I think that what you are saying isn't entirely true, it is only part of the point. The main reason is because it's the right thing to do. I know there are teens that actually do this, but my point was that isn't occurring on a national scale like the other kinds of protests we are seeing. I think the teens marching to ban abortion are *vastly* outnumbered by teens who favor issues on the left, and even if they weren't, lowering the voting age to 16 is just the right thing to do. I've been in favor of this issue for about 13 years.Nice, props to you for being politically active!I think that's confirmation bias on your part because there's been plenty of white dudes (generally dumb comedians) that have gotten shit on too. A bad guest is a bad guest. Mayor Tubbs is really great. His point about 'universal' being the important part of UBI is so spot on. As he said, UBI may not be a panacea, but experiments like his are a great step in the right direction towards universalizing and de-bureaucratizing our social safety net.  In fact, I think it's best we stop using the 'safety net' metaphor all together, and go with a 'foundation' instead. "A permanent support structure, not a temporary failsafe," as [Matt Bruenig writes in Jacobin](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/08/welfare-state-safety-net-bruenig).there are a tiny fringe of people on Tumblr, mostly people who just took an intro to sociology class for the first time and woefully misunderstood the concepts they learned, who persist in perpetuating a lot of these ideas. Most of these people are inoculated in campus communities which never challenge their extreme views but once they enter the real world they will soften them inevitably. 

In other words, a couple of kids somewhere saying white people shouldn't eat tacos aren't the real enemies and it is a right wing strawman which delegitimizes the entire social justice movement to buy into it. Kind of like how, for many older women like my mom, "feminism" became associated with a right wing caricature of women who hate men. for real, people who take offense to comments about white men being the worst because "wait a minute, I am a white man!" are totally missing the point. Whiteness, as a concept, and masculinity, again conceptually, have done immense harm to this country historically. Individual men who are also caucasian are not implicitly bad but White Manhood generally has been bad for this country and everyone who doesn't belong to that group.

you know, kind of like how white privilege doesn't actually mean all white people are rich. Only that you're statistically less likely to spend as much time in prison for the same crime or more likely to find a job. dumber than the former mayor of LA hawking junk MLM products?

ok Yes, even dumber than that.As a Californian, the discussion about our Senate race was v interesting! I'm of the opinion that Dianne is 84 and maybe she should have retired instead of running for another 6 year term. CA Dems need to be promoting younger voices in the party and to keep moving forward. It would have been better for the party for her to retire and for there to healthy primary between Dems to really have a debate about what we want the future of the party in this state to look like.Yeah I’m with the guys on Laura Moser: what the fuck is wrong with the DCCC?

Seriously why do these people think liberal/left Democrats can’t win seats?? Seriously, these districts are way more liberal than you think! RUN ON APPROPRIATE POLICIES. &gt;these districts are way more liberal than you think

Yea, there's actually [good political science research](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2930362) to back this up. Democrats need to have some confidence in their policy positions.I’m glad someone else knows Chris’ work. I'd take issue with Fav's characterization of De Leon and Feinstein as "not too far apart on issues."  Health care and foreign policy are two of the biggest issues, and they are as different as two Democrats can be. California is a liberal state, there's no reason to put up with a right wing Democrat. To their point about pushing her to the left, I don't think septuagenarians or octogenarians are too prone to change (see: Trump, Donald).

I love their take on the DCCC though. The Intercept has done some [great reporting](https://theintercept.com/2018/01/23/dccc-democratic-primaries-congress-progressives/) on the issue.I think I heard about it on The Weeds IIRC.I had to toss that one. Do you have an idea of the episode?I think the best solution is for the candidates to put the good of the country ahead of their personal political ambition. And when it's getting closer to the election, they have to look at the polls, and the candidates who are trailing need to pull out and endorse one of the top 2 Dem candidates and campaign with/for them.Dude, I literally said in both of my posts that even if teens as a whole skewed on the conservative side it would STILL be the right thing to do to give them suffrage. I am specially saying that teens  skewing left is NOT the reason I support this issue. That happens to be the case though, which I obviously think is a good thing.Maybe not, but I think the point still stands. All I'm saying is that she has made her policy positions clear. As a constituent, I don't agree with those positions (death penalty, Iraq war and defense in general, health care, having "patience" with Trump, etc), and I don't expect her to change them at this point, so a primary is the way to solve this. I think they talked about it a long time ago too, but they discussed it more closely last Tuesday in an episode titled ["It's finally infrastructure week."](https://art19.com/shows/the-weeds/episodes/2d0805b0-6dfb-4b32-9b0b-6a599a0713b2)Yea, seriously! Shapiro is worse than Milo or Coulter in the sense that he can launder alt-right views into the mainstream via credulous reporters at places like the NYTimes. Obligitory link to Nathan J. Robinson's epic takedown of Shapiro: [The Cool Kid's Philosopher](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/12/the-cool-kids-philosopher)Long term, I think we need to switch to ranked-choice voting in California. The Top Two primary system has its perks (in what's essentially a 1-party state, it makes sense to have two Dem options in the Senate General Election), but Ranked Choice just makes a lot more sense, and would do away with these tricky situations.Yea it's a great argument. The simplicity is a huge plus ([Make Government Simple Again!](http://theweek.com/articles/709398/make-government-simple-again)). But I would emphasize that we can't simply clear out our entire welfare state and replace it with a flat universal payment, like many libertarians advocate, because it would end up shifting resources away from the poorest people. But we could vastly simplify and consolidate many of the dozens of piecemeal means-tested anti-poverty programs into one flat payment (saving a ton on administration and overhead), while maintaining and expanding other elements like Medicare (or ideally expanding it universally). Ultimately we should both spend more, and also spend more efficiently.I think it stands to reason that the young Republicans most likely to run for office are not the ones who are simply Republicans because their parents are. The article had polling showing that young Republicans are by far the most likely cohort to leave the party, and I'd bet many of those are the ones who were born into it. Any young person who looks at the modern GOP and says "I want in" has, at the very least, a major blindspot when it comes to race. We'll see to what extent Pareene's prediction comes true, but I'm afraid he's spot on.Their own self conception/presentation doesn't change whether they're racist or not. The "on many sides" line is just a deflection, not a representation of their actual views. Fox clearly don't seem to mind the alt-right. Take Tucker Carlson, their highest rated commentator. He's embraced [white identity politics](https://thinkprogress.org/the-unrepentant-racism-of-tucker-carlson-tonight-199c79157cb6/). The younger cohort of conservative personalities (the ones that are most likely to influence the future GOP leaders we're talking about) have gone even further than Fox, with Ben Shapiro talking about how Palestinians like to "[bomb crap and live in open sewage](https://twitter.com/benshapiro/status/25712847277)" and Milo/Bannon [literally letting white nationalists](https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/heres-how-breitbart-and-milo-smuggled-white-nationalism?utm_term=.rxLKrwnqV#.yo7Jy1GPL) write the Brietbart profile on the alt-right. Yea, absolutely. Shapiro's presentation style is so seeped in pedantry and sophistry, he's got to be one of the most obnoxious people out there.You only allow followers to see your tweets...hard for us to retweetAbsolutely. If Favreau says that "there's not much difference" between the policies of a leftist and a liberal one more time, I'm going to walk into traffic.I'm also broadly sympathetic to the idea of our most left-wing states reflecting more left wing ideas.I liked when Favreau started out by saying that they agree on most things but then was forced to admit that they weren't agreed on healthcare, foreign policy, immigration, etc. Like, come on... throw in abortion and you're basically in "why are these people in the same party" territory on all the major issues.  I deleted it upon the request from the corporate offices. Had a 15 minute talk with our District Manager yesterday during my shift. Told me he personally agrees with my position but the powers that be want things a certain wayDidn't the guys advertise it once on PSA?I subscribe to up first but npr is npr and they have about as much personality as a doorknob. I imagine the NYT isn’t much different?I was surprised about not allowing corruption investigations in Wisconsin. I knew bad shit was going on, but that is just insanityI literally had no idea they did live videos on facebook holy shit! is this a daily thing?Yea I came here to suggest the same. Majority report is to the left of PSA, but to the right of Chapo. Their offshoot, the Michael Brooks Show, is really good too, but it's only once a week.&gt; a set of hot takes instead of any sort of more deeply considered opinion.

To be honest I kind of want that though...I want to listen to someone that talks like me reacting of the crazy shit that goes on in the new every day.

However, I see your point.True - I love those illicit histories.lol the interns' breaking news noiseYes, 100%. Has to skip forward whenever she really got into it. I agree with all her sentiments but god almighty everyone in the room already agrees so there’s no need to go overboard. Do you listen to "Pop Rocket"? It hits the right spots for me. Louis has been occasional fill-in panelist as well.  I think that trying to get leadership that the GOP won't use is a futile exercise. They're going to demonize anyone (especially a woman as leader) so lets not try to fit into their framework. I'd like new leadership, sure. But a lot of the obvious frontrunners will be gearing up to run in 2020 so I can't offer any suggestions. 

The inner workings of party leadership/power are a lot about fundraising and whipping capabilities and Pelosi, especially, is pretty great at that. The last vote for her she won with something like 68% against Tim Ryan in 2016. That's not a landslide but there's no sign of a coup against her like the sort that Paul Ryan has to constantly worry about. Because she's a flawed politician, who I think is severely misreading the tea leaves, and thinks its necessary to leave room for Democrats in tight races to not have a shut-down as a minority party while also accurately aware Paul Ryan would never let DACA come to a vote on the floor because he's a cretin controlled by the Freedom Caucus. The misreading of the tea leaves and the direction of WHY there's so much energy right now is one reason why I'd like new leadership.

There have been tough votes - ACA, the repeal of ACA - that she's done very well and other votes where she let things go. I'm more annoyed at Schumer than Pelosi, personally. 
Probably because it's easier to focus on taking back Congress and assuming leadership will stay the same instead of getting distracted by hypothetical changes in leadership. The important thing is winning the elections. We can talk about leadership later.Do you have any specific problems with their leadership? Or suggestions for who you think should take their positions? 

I see this sentiment a lot and it seems pretty much like internalized right wing propaganda mixed with being understandably sick of the same old bullshit where nothing changes. Not trying to attack you or anything, but Pelosi and Schumer seem like capable leaders to me. I would prefer leaders that lean much farther left, but no one specifically comes to mind in our current group of politicians.Synopsis: Chaos, at least more than usual, at the White House: Hope is out, Jared is screwed, Kelly feels God's wrath, Trump declares war on metal, and Mueller is in everyone's business. Amanda Hess of the New York Times, comedian Patti Harrison, and the LA Times' Tre’vell Anderson join Jon to break down the week's news. Plus D'Arcy Carden from NBC's The Good Place stops by to take on the role of a lifetime and we play an Oscars game you won't want to miss. What. A. Week.

It's been 4 days...this is the tree falling in the empty forest...Well, NYT The Daily isn't at all how you're describing. I think a Crooked podcast that mirrored The Daily would be amazing.Listened to a couple and I don't really care for the host, but other than that they are pretty good.I liked the Woke Capital rant. Ross Douthat has many bad takes, but he's definitely one of the more interesting conservative columnists. His "[The Rise of Woke Capital](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/opinion/corporate-america-activism.html)" article is very much worth reading.

&gt;... At an accelerating pace our corporate class is trying to negotiate a different kind of peace, a different deal from the one they struck with New Deal liberalism and Big Labor. Instead of the Treaty of Detroit we have, if you will, Peace of Palo Alto, in which a certain kind of virtue-signaling on progressive social causes, a certain degree of performative wokeness, is offered to liberalism and the activist left pre-emptively, in the hopes that having corporate America take their side in the culture wars will blunt efforts to tax or regulate our new monopolies too heavily.

...

&gt;The interesting question is whether the incense-tossing works. In certain ways the Peace of Palo Alto won’t be fully tested until the next time the Democrats hold real power, when we’ll get to find out whether the left’s antimonopoly forays have any follow-through, whether more than a token portion of the Trump corporate tax cuts will get rolled back — or whether corporate wokeness will suffice as a concession to the new spirit of liberalism, enabling the easy post-1980s relationship between corporate America and the Democratic Party to endure.

I think this is a pretty spot on, and I hope the Democrats don't accept the "Peace of Palo Alto," as he puts it. There is [no conflict between economic and identity justice](http://archive.is/vO21K), but if the post-1980s relationship between corporate America and the Democratic Party (known more simply as neoliberalism) is maintained, it will sacrifice actual progress on both economic and identity issues in exchange for empty posturing. Lol, yea that's a good episode, and Douthat is usually terrible (no excuse for making the case for Marine Le Pen), but I think his take here is good, and shows he has a better grasp on the dynamics of the Democratic party than some within it (eg [denying that neoliberalism is a thing](https://twitter.com/tomwatson/status/969721853936840704)).

Your point about the identity politics is spot on. There is [no conflict between economic and identity justice](http://archive.is/vO21K). The choice isn't between identity and economics, it's a choice between fighting for both or accepting a performative wokeness that doesn't begin to deal with any structural issues. 

&gt;They just want to have their cake and eat it too; they want to back right wing economic policies while preventing progressive from protesting and giving them bad PR

Very true - Apple is a great example of this too. They've cultivated a relatively 'woke' reputation, but like most other massive corporations, they went out of their way to give Trump and the GOP [tons of good press](https://www.vox.com/explainers/2018/1/25/16904136/corporate-america-tax-cut-celebrations-explained) after the tax bill passed.I absolutely cannot do that? Its like the annoying need to disclaim that HRC ran an imperfect campaign - no campaign is perfect, and certainly even WINNING isn't an indication of a Good Campaign. But disclaiming means people are (somewhat) less likely to accuse me of being a centrist moron blahblah. 

I think Pelosi is a capable whip, an amazing fundraiser. I think a lot of the criticisms of her are basically the result of people resenting their moms and taking it out on middle-aged female politicians, which is fun to untangle that knot.

Some are in good faith but it can be hard to distinguish between them during a short internet comment.So Delta taking a potshot at the NRA is what it takes for Douthat to parrot Thomas Frank. I bet if Barnes and Noble stopped carrying *Left Behind* he would write a column about how property is theft.Yea, this is really good context. Thiel is a ghoul. I'd highly recommended listening to [this Michael Brooks Show segment](http://michaelbrooksshow.libsyn.com/unlocked-fascism-in-silicon-valley-wcorey-pein-illicit-history-1) on fascism in Silicon Valley. The Dark Enlightenment was definitely the most recent turn towards fascism, but it has deep roots there.For nearly seven years! Synopsis: White House staffers are concerned about Trump’s stability but only on background, Trump escalates the world’s first Twitter-based trade war, West Virginia’s teachers have had enough, and Conor Lamb has a chance in a deep red Pennsylvania district. Then former Obama Ethics Czar Norm Eisen talks about the corruption roiling Trump’s White House, and Ira Madison joins Jon, Jon, and Tommy in studio to talk about the Oscars.

It may not be, I'm in Ireland and it's on over here, assumed it would be on US Netflix as well given the subject matter. Weird that it isn't. Too bad they started recording before Nunberg's meltdown..... the pod was not in existence in 2011.Maybe it's because my sister is a public school teacher, but I feel VERY strongly about the fact that as a society we need to invest in our public schools. Pay teachers enough to attract talented people to the profession. Pay them enough so they can afford a nice middle class existence for their work. Keeping talented men and women as teachers in the public school system means we get the benefits of a better educated younger generation.I think it will be on HBO later?Good to hear coverage of the teachers strike. I appreciate that they not only mention their own lack of union coverage, but also the harm that Democrats like Joe Manchin have done by embracing corporate tax cuts that starve states of money to fund essential services. While I'd take Manchin over a Republican, that's a false choice. We should be supporting [fire-breathing populists like Richard Ojeda](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/03/02/richard-ojeda-west-virginia-blue-army-one-217217) who can win in rural red-states without selling out workers. The people of West Virginia have every right to be skeptical of the modern Democratic party and we need to earn back their trust by actually proposing policies that help them.That last article about Republicans not finding dates is fucking hilarious!


Who knew it was so hard for racists and misogynists to find dates 😂I mean, no, but it's something that members of his administration have to answer for. Obama really did nothing for unions and his admin pushed bullshit "school choice" policies. Race to the Top, the primary education initiative of Obama's first term, explicitly tied DoE grants to expanding charter schools. Arne Duncan also advocated for charter schools a bunch and Ted Mitchell, the third in command of the DoE under Obama was the former head of a charter school advocacy group. ...how is that anything other than promoting school choice, though? It's not like this was part of some controlled experiment to disprove the effectiveness of charters, Arne Duncan and Ted Mitchell were big charter school proponents. There's a reason that the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers both called on Duncan to resign. Wasn't he literally called Obama's brain or something like that, too? ...so you are for school choice. They "pushed" it by requiring equitable funding of charters and repeal of prohibitions on their expansion in order to get federal school funding. That is a policy designed to promote school choice and to restrict states ability to regulate them in the manner they see fit. 

It's really not that complicated. Trying to claim it's bad when DeVoss does it but fine when Duncan does it is just bullshit rank hypocrisy. Jesus, I’m sorry, but Ira really bothers me. I guess because he’s a very obvious example of a growing obnoxiousness that seems to be getting more and more prevalent in the left these days, particularly on social media and among younger people. I’m definitely on the left and consider myself liberal but this is something else. The oscars thing is a good example - everyone with this attitude who feels somehow betrayed that their favorite movie didn’t win Best Picture feels the need to shit all over the Shape of Water (‘fish secks whaaaaat loll???!’) and Del Toro for winning Best Director, and shit all over Three Billboards for winning in the acting categories. And t was disappointing to hear all the PSA hosts join in. Most of these people admit to not even having seen the movies. Christ almighty, I didn’t hear a single person acting like a child in a tantrum because Peele won best original screenplay over anyone else. 

I don’t know. I know this will get downvotes if it’s read at all. The movements that are dominating the culture now are important and need to have light shone on them at every opportunity, but it’s being turned into an incredibly negative tool that some use to justify shitting on others who have done nothing wrong. The Shape of Water is a fine movie. It’s not anyone involved’s fault that Ladybird or Get Out didn’t win. Fair enough, I guess I was more just thinking of many other examples of similar sort of attitudes that were actually worse than Ira’s but hearing it on the pod just made me especially annoyed. 

I’m totally out of the loop on Three Billboards, is it really that bad? Exactly, you put it very well there. It’s the fact that it is apolitical and just a ‘good movie’ as opposed to a good movie and *also* a significant political statement with real life ramifications that bothers people. Is that a MVMT watch? And I hope he's wearing Tommy John Underwear. I hope he's just wearing John's. Worth mentioning that Schumer deserves a lot of blame as well ([as Alex Pareene points out on twitter](https://twitter.com/pareene/status/971073141366812673)). Not only is this absolutely terrible policy, but Democratic support was also simply [given away for nothing](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/6/17086452/democrats-dodd-frank) (rather than in exchange for something like competent leadership at the CFPB). As Beutler concludes the article: "This wasn’t a borderline case in which Democrats were torn between their ideals and the messy obligations of governing. It was completely voluntary. They were just hoping you wouldn’t notice."Yeah, Schumer is... well, I hope that there's a mix up of leadership when we take back the Senate in 2018. We need a stronger leader who will stand up for Democrat ideals.I agree, Nancy has done her job countless times, but Schumer disappoints on the biggest stage. He absolutely floundered on the shutdown causing criticism on both sides. He has shown that he is not in touch with the progressive movement going on in the country. 



I think a real progressive leader is needed for the Senate. Someone who will do what it takes (nuke filibuster) to allow actual legislation to get passed, not watered down néolibéral BS. It would also force Republicans to act in good faith in making legislation, because any bad faith actors will be ignored while real balanced budget conservatives will have a seat at the table. We need a leader who does not capitulate to the 30% MAGA voters, but the 70% of voters who actually want Congress to function.Yeah, I'm mentally running down the list of Dem senators rn and idk who the best choice for leadership would be. But I guess it depends on who is wanting to stay in the Senate vs who is sniffing around a 2020 run. Someone who has progressive policies and also the leadership abilities/respect of their colleagues to accomplish a legislative agenda.I didn't listen to the pod and I don't know much about what happened in Zimbabwe that you referenced. So lmao keep that in mind as I finish this comment. Aka I am very uneducated about what is going on and am basing my thoughts solely on your post.

But maybe what's going on in South Africa is akin to Reconstruction in the South after the Civil War? IDK though.I think Tammy Baldwin or Jeff Merkley would be great Senate leaders (Merkley has talked about eliminating the filibuster, which is essential). Pramila Jayapal or Keith Ellison would be good picks House (unless Ellison takes Franken's seat in the Senate).He's probably left handed. You should wear your watch on your non dominant handThey should have discussed the very real problems with the plan, but with that being said, they're right that reparations are needed. Expropriation of farmland isn't a great way to do that, but apartheid was an economic system as well as a cultural one, and if you just allow integration and full democracy without dealing with the economic realities leftover from a racist system, then you haven't really gotten rid of apartheid. In the short-term we may be stuck with them, but in the long-term we should replace Manchin with Richard Ojeda, Tim Kaine with Tom Perriello, Joe Donnelly with Pete Buttegieg, etc. 

If Manchin pulled a Jim Justice and switched to the GOP, that'd actually be good because it'd push the overton window to the left.Yea, that's a good take, I'd prefer that too. But if the left can find some more good candidates I'd like to see Donnelly and Manchin primaried eventually. I think it's true that we need people tailored for these states, but that doesn't mean we need to only run conservatives. Populism can be a pragmatic path to victory. I don't think the people of West Virginia are calling out for loosening bank regulations so this vote doesn't have the same rational as something like Manchin's vote against cap-and-trade. But yea, without Manchin the ACA is repealed right now, so I'll take him until we can get something better.I'm not sure if any national politician would answer this question well, but the correct answer is [**abolish ICE**](http://theweek.com/articles/755454/end-ice).Yea well said.Fucking this!

I'm sick of these arguments about how THE ONLY VOTE THAT MATTERS IS THE ONE THAT MAKES CHUCK SCHUMER SPEAKER

no, that is not the only vote that matters. Like, if you're a Democrat who isn't pro-choice so that you can win in West Virginia, what would you actually do in a vote where you could make the difference on a constitutional right to life amendment? If you're constantly cozying up to credit card companies and big banks, how will you vote if we get enough seats to undo Citizens United? These are far fetched scenarios, but the ACA shows us what happens when one "Democrat" who fucking endorsed John McCain for President decides to say "screw the public option". 

People like to poo-poo "purity tests" as unsavory and unrealistic, but an organization with no firmly held principles as a barrier to membership is an organization which ultimately stands for nothing. And you always hear this from the most privileged people... the ones for whom being a Democrat isn't about actual things like reproductive rights or healthcare or criminal justice reform or social programs because those aren't issues that they have to deal with on a daily basis. They're upper middle class, "some of my best friends are Republicans, in fact I would vote John Huntsman" white dudes. The Democratic Party, in their minds, is a lot like being a Republican *anyway* only more secular, less overtly racist, and more interested in scientific consensus. They like the Dems because the Dems care about decorum and rules.

Their ideal Democratic government wouldn't pass a single piece of legislation other than censures for bad behavior. Doesn't the local variant of the Green Party (under a different name) actually do pretty well? I seem to recall that they campaign to end mountaintop removal mining and are one of the strongest Green parties in the country. 

That could be harnessed. And the Godwin Award for goes to...Yea, ICE is a full employment program for racist chuds who couldn't crack police academy.I think we should abolish ICE and that, in my heart of hearts, that borders are a nonsensical legal fiction buuuuut while ICE itself was created in 2002 it wasn't like there weren't government agencies that didn't FUNCTION the same way as ICE. 

ICE is a consolidation of INS and United States Customs Service. We still didn't need it but we had government agencies that performed similar or the exact same function as ICE before reshuffling and renaming. If working people in red states want to vote for their own self interest, they should move to a blue state where the Democrats might actually act in the interest of working people. /s&gt;Buttegieg will be every bit as bad as Donnelly

Interesting, I'm not super familiar with him but he seemed somewhat good (his [essay praising Bernie](https://www.jfklibrary.org/Education/Profile-in-Courage-Essay-Contest/~/media/32A849B1D0E6446B9BCAFCCDF90B2BB8.pdf) way back in 2000 made me think his instincts might be ok). I don't doubt that you're right, but what makes you think he'll be bad?And, good god, drop irrelevant or super old jobs as you go along. Nobody needs to know that you worked at Wendy's in college.Synopsis: Trump accepts Kim Jong Un’s invite to a Madman vs Madman summit, Mueller has a new witness, and Democrats look to turn Texas blue. Former Houston Texan Arian Foster joins Jon, Jon, Tommy, Dan, and Brittany Packnett on stage live in Houston, Texas.

Oops! I made a typo. I think the meaning is still clear. Hopefully no one is confusing it for that other show, Love It Or Leave It. That Pod Save America is 4 white dudes. lol. It's a fair point. It doesn't mean Jon, Jon, Tommy and Dan are bad people or that they shouldn't be there. But it's fair to point out that PSA is dude heavy.lol I laughed.

But maybe it's because I'm an evil feminist.I think you're being really defensive over a joke that the people it was aimed at seemed to have no problem with.You disagree that Brittany was the only woman on stage?The implication that even in liberal spaces, men's voices are the biggest?No but it’d be fair to point out that your podcast was yet another podcast by a dude. That’s all Brittany was doing and it was pretty clearly not meant to hurt any of the guys. Just point out a gender imbalance. 

Fun fact! It wasn’t until 1973 that women were allowed to serve on juries in all 50 states. 12 Angry Men was written in 1954 and it was in 1957 that the Civil Rights Act gave women the right to serve on federal juries. I’m sure there have been. Lovett has had all female panels several times and I am like 98% sure that there have been more than one female guest on PSA live shows. Which is why I don’t think Brittany was like angry about it because she knows they make an effort to include a diversity of voices. She was just making a joke about there being 4 dudes and one woman on the Pod on international women’s day. The ‘realities of the situation’ in 12 Angry Men’s juror makeup being.... sexism. Systemic sexism is why there are 12 men.

So I’m not sure of the relevance here unless you’re saying systemic sexism is why Brittany was the only woman on the Pod yesterday?Is it harsh or is it true?

Sure we have Rachel Maddow and there are other left leaning women fighting the good fight. But if we can’t acknowledge that liberal spaces are not exempt from the same sexism as the rest of the world, then we can’t change it. 

But yes I do think that PSA/Crooked Media makes an effort to interview women and POC and use them as contributors and have them working behind the scenes. So if Brittany was like completely roasting them, I’d say that’s unfair. But she wasn’t. It was a one sentence jab. They recorded it last night, so it's on a different cycle. When it's a studio show, I always get it between 4:30 and 6:00.I personally don't get it. 


Schumer just came out with a trillion dollars infrastructure plan, which would be funded by rolling back the tax breaks for the rich. Beto flat out ignored Cruz's name bait ad and is focused on real issues. You see Dems fighting for diversity and equality in their midterm platforms, while Republicans talk about MS-13, gun rights, and kiss up to Trump.


At this point... If the 'indecisive moderate' voters can't decide on D vs R, then us progressives should move on and focus on:

 
1) Criminal justice reform, close private prisons, prosecute bad Police officers

2) Bring back unions

3) National minimum wage to $10 and cities increasing even more depending on the economic situation

4) Large infrastructure projects across the nation including bullet trains, roads, Bridges

5) Regulating banks and corporations, while removing tax loopholes and holding CEOs accountable when they exploit people or brake the law.

6) Reversing citizens United and reducing corporate lobbying in government

7) Increasing top marginal tax rates to Eisenhower levels of 75-91%, while also increasing taxes to every bracket so everyone contributes something.

8) Ending the Middle Eastern wars, while boosting their basic infrastructure to increase stability and US soft power

9) Halving our military budget, while increasing assistance to veterans.

10) Pass Single-payer/MFA, and other social security systems

11) Increase payout to teachers/reducing the profiteering of schools and universities

12)  Lastly, opening up immigration to allow young, inspired, hard-working people to come and become American citizens (which means getting rid of ICE)   But I think it's not the ideology that is the big difference, it is the details that are where we are divided.


What we see is that the Democrats have to be so sensitive to the media because any time they take a hard stance, the media crucifies them. Even if the idea is popular with Americans, the 'moderates' will get upset when they take a stance.


But I personally believe politicians should not fear being wrong, but fear themselves giving up to the media pundits.I want someone who will take to to floor and fight like Anthony Weiner! He is a shit human being, but a great politician. Watch the video of him defending the 9/11 bill

https://youtu.be/_O_GRkMZJn4 

We need someone like him as leaderAwhile back a similar poll came out and they talked about it on PSA. [This is the episode \(start at 37:19\)](https://art19.com/shows/pod-save-america/episodes/57c65170-e400-4705-a58a-b4d6b4fbc2a9). Lovett made the point that the Democratic policy apparatus has a tendency to take simple proposals and over complicate them with means testing and preemptive compromises.  All the good policy in the world doesn't help you if you can communicate it in clear and simple ways. These would by my main points: 

1. Focus on simple policy that materially helps people. Make it clear that a vote for Democrats is a vote for giving everyone health care. Ditch the means testing, which engenders resentment and squeezes middle class families above the cutoff line (as the ACA did). 

2. Embrace populism everywhere. Democrats often argue that upscale districts won't vote for big government liberals, but there's limited evidence for that. Consider that a [majority of people making over $100,000 think that the rich don't pay their fair share](http://www.people-press.org/2017/04/14/top-frustrations-with-tax-system-sense-that-corporations-wealthy-dont-pay-fair-share/). Plus, Republican economic policy is so extreme that you really have to be making $700,000+ to really benefit. [This article](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/12/15942870/class-warfare-upscale-suburbs) fleshes the argument for running populists in upscale districts further. On the other end of the spectrum, working class red states are ripe for a [different kind of populism](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/03/02/richard-ojeda-west-virginia-blue-army-one-217217).

3. Focus on non-voters, not moderates. If you're engaged in politics and haven't made up your mind at this point, you're probably a lost cause. The Dems should [focus on non-voters](https://theoutline.com/post/3431/forget-trump-voters-democrats-need-young-people-of-color-non-voters?zd=1&amp;zi=lyxhkmwc), particularly working class, POC, and young voters. Look at Jeremy Corbyn - he ran a very left wing campaign and he got record breaking levels of youth turnout (not to mention winning in some of the richest districts too, to bolster point number 2).

4. Stop ostracizing the base. In the point you mentioned, *only 67% of Democrats have a favorable view of the Democratic party*. The DCCC has been acting so terribly that even some of the people on the right of the party have had to admit it. The gutting of Dodd-Frank was so outrageous that even Joy Reid was appalled. Democratic leaders need to let voters make decisions themselves, and adopt the unity commission's findings in full to reform the party. 

5. Actually get shit done once in power. This won't help in the next two elections, but once Democrats take full power back, they need to prove themselves. After the New Deal, Democrats forced Republicans to shift left on economics for 30 years because the New Deal was so popular. To get a big win like that, Democrats need to play constitutional hardball. Get rid of the filibuster, mobilize the base to push for legislation, and brake norms that get in the way, so long as the result is good policy that helps people. I agree with all of your points!


It's easy for someone politically active like me to understand the minutia of Washington, but to the average voter it seems like nonsense. It is hard for someone like me to defend the ACA because it is a complicated moderate solution to a frustrating problem. It is easier for me to defend MFA and just throw the line "healthcare for everyone". No bullshit, no think tanks, no jargon. Easy.



But, I do fear that populism rears its ugly head eventually. For example, some populist policies like getting rid of NAFTA are counterproductive. The easy solution is to say 'we are losing jobs, bad deal for the US'. But, it is more complicated than that and the correct answer is the tough one.



What I'm saying is, I want us to win! I want to win back the presidency, Senate, house, governors, etc. But I don't want to be the GOP, where populism and appealing to the common denominator comes before good policy. Populism is easy, but governing is hard. 


Side note:
I want every Democrat running for president to be asked the same question... "Do you support nuking the filibuster?" If they say no, I will not support them.


I cannot go through another 8 years of watching us bend and break before this modern GOP! They absolutely do not deserve our respect and should only be taken seriously if they will contribute to Democratic bills. I want every popular legislation rammed through Congress within the first 4 years.  You're not wrong, I agree completely. I get the impression that when a guest takes the conversation in a direction like that, even though it could feel a bit unnatural (or very unnatural), they hesitate to try to steer it back, maybe because they feel like they'd be seen as suppressing or stepping on the toes of that conversation and topic. Can't blame them because the way things are people probably would scold them for not 100% going with that sort of conversation if it went there, but I still would like if they steered it towards the topics immediately at hand in that moment and kept the conversation moving forward. Dan is always the saving grace of the live shows for me tbh. Love the other three but the live shows often turn into corny pep rallies and Dan always sort of grounds it back to the conversation. I posted a response to this last night on mobile, but I guess it didn't go through.

Long story short: Republicans are included in this question, so 50% is more likely the ceiling you're aiming for.

Factor in independents whose only knowledge of parties is of attack ads and congressional gridlock, plus some more left-wing Democrats annoyed that the party doesn't go further, and 31% seems close to what you'd expect at this point. If Dems get wins and start implementing their ideas, you'll probably want to see it reach 40.Synopsis: Well it’s been another boring week without news here in America. Yikes. Anyway, we covered: potential campaign finance violations related to Trump’s sex NDAs, Mueller is moving and witnesses are losing it, Fox News freaks over the Oscars, and more. In a special “Keep It” edition of the show, Jon is joined by Ira Madison III, Kara Brown, and Louis Virtel to break down the week’s news, recorded live from Austin, Texas.

&gt; Congratulations, that’d be obnoxious on your podcast too. I’d prefer to hear intelligent arguments (and intelligent jokes too) about politics and policy.

But there have been jokes about appearance and mannerisms on Lovett or Leave It since its inception. Lauren Lapkus called Sean Spicer 'an angry hot dog in a suit'. They paused Sean Spicer in the middle of a word and Kumail Nanjiani said "That's his O-face!" Jon Lovett called Trump a fascist hamburglar and Ike Barinholtz made fun of the way Trump says his own name. This sort of thing isn't new.Yea absolutely! Getting rid of the filibuster is essential. I'm sort of surprised McConnell hasn't done it himself, but I think he's thinking long-term and knows it'd help progressives more than it'd help the GOP.

In terms of the dangers of populism, I think there are dangers in every style of politics (neoliberalism got Bill Clinton the presidency, but also led to welfare reform that double the number of people living in extreme poverty). I support free trade broadly speaking, but I wouldn't support trade deals with ISDS or without proper worker/environmental standards. So I think the line for populists in the rust belt would be "trade deals have screwed workers over, so I'm going to negotiate better deals" (which is essentially what both Trump and Hillary said). Following through on that sort of trade would probably still ultimately result in some job losses, but that's the point of a social democratic welfare state. Assuming the rest of the progressive agenda is enacted, we wouldn't see the same sort of misery that has overtaken many areas in the rust belt. A [universal job guarantee](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/02/federal-job-guarantee-universal-basic-income-investment-jobs-unemployment/) would be another good progressive policy agenda to counteract the negative effects of trade without sacrificing the benefits.What actual plan for universal health care do you prefer?I don't think it's valid, I think it's a cheap and casual insinuation that bears out to be totally false. It *sounds* good when you say it, but it just isn't the case. 

The irony of accusing video games of being unhealthy after spending the whole episode talking joyfully about movies and pop culture TV...I found Lovett’s commentary on video games pretty troubling...As in, I found myself disagreeing a lot with what he said initially. Do you listen to the Michael Brooks show? I think he does a good job of combining something closer to Chapo's ideology with Seder's practicality. They're a supposed to be a big tent organization, but they don't have a ton of representation of the left wing of the Democratic party (Lovett, Erin Gloria Ryan, and Symone Sanders, though none are even that far to the left). 

No excuse on the USofC thing, that was just dumb, but that being said, they were good on DACA - they probably actually helped inspire the shutdown, but the Democrats didn't execute well and the PSA guys were very critical of them for it (enough that the centrists on this sub were hand-wringing about it). 
I think it's similar to the point Matt Christman made in the [video game debate with Virgil Texas](https://www.i24news.tv/en/tv/replay/stateside/x6g1fco) - that video games don't lead to violence, but they do lead to social atomization. I tend to agree more with Virgil, but I think Matt made some interesting points.Not to change the subject but in my opinion social media as a whole has had a massively negative effect on us, exponentially worse than video games or anything else. Listening to people opine the negativity of video games is astoundingly myopic in that context. (Especially while simultaneously praising TV and movies.) 

Video games are a drop in the metaphorical bucket of the socialization problems we have today.Yea, I completely agree. Looking at gaming in a vacuum is pointless. Information technology and the broadening of the media landscape have both drastically changed our lives, and the biggest element is social media, not gaming. I feel like he should talk to Jordan Peterson about this. Ira Madison is great when it comes to pop culture, but I tend to tune him out when it comes to anything else. I mean, the guy said Bryan Cranston was "canceled" on Twitter because a clickbait headline said Cranston was defending Harvey Weinstein (which he wasn't).His rant was dumb for multiple reasons:

1. I get that he wasn't blaming them for mass shootings, but if you're going to use your rant time to attack them in our current context, it's going to be difficult for people to sparse out the nuance. When people that like games, violent or not, are being subjected to this crap on Fox News, the last thing they want to hear is how bad they are from a Crooked Media podcast.

2. Even in a vacuum his rant was wrong. I have killed countless "people" in games. So what? Seriously, so what? The only time I've been violent in my entire life was when I beat a guy up in middle school for insulting my disabled brother. I'm about as far from a violent person in real life as you can be and I'm always looking to be a peacemaker. Killing virtual people has absolutely no impact on how you do things in real life. I've also killed countless Goombas in Mario games, yet I've never once felt the urge to jump on someone's head.

3. Lovett has a Hollywood past, so it looked shady that he went after games specifically and didn't mention violent TV shows or movies. I just finished Altered Carbon on Netflix and that was one of the most violent shows I've ever seen. Brent Bozell could have just as easily created a compilation of violent images coming out of Hollywood to play for Trump, would Lovett have then attacked his Hollywood peers as well? Maybe, but I have my doubts.

We all have dumb takes though, myself included, so it's not like I'm going to stop listening or that I'm going to "cancel" Jon Lovett. But I'm absolutely going to jump on Reddit to defend something I love.What's meant by "odd" though? "Bad"? If so, why is it bad? If the definition really is just "odd" though, what difference does it make? Here I am on a Sunday morning choosing to post about a podcast on Reddit.com and here you are reading it. Isn't that a little odd too? Maybe, but how I and you and how anyone else chooses to live their lives isn't anyone else's business except their own.Synopsis: America sends its best negotiator to denuclearize a dictator, and Democrats craft an economic message for 2018. Then Texas Democratic Senate candidate Beto O’Rourke joins Jon, Jon, Tommy, Dan, and Brittany on stage live at Austin City Limits. 

Why limit it to just gore subreddits? If you're spending lots of time on Reddit when you could be doing more "productive" things, couldn't someone say that was unhealthy too? People should just live how they want to live unless they're doing something illegal and they don't need lectures from anyone besides doctors or mental health professionals about their hobbies.Beto sounds like a swell dude. Hope he wins :)

Also, why was the crowd so rowdy? The non stop yelling out of stuff got a little annoying to hear on the audio, i wonder if it was annoying the guys and BetoI love these guys, truly, but I’m kind of miffed they’re relegating what could be an amazing conversation (especially after what Jon said on LoLI about masculinity being poisoned) to cheap punchlines. Damn. It really is an echo chamber. Okay so a couple of things a lot that Mic article:

First of all, it’s dripping with contempt. If a conservative wrote a piece like this on a liberal, we’d dismiss it out of hand for the tone alone. 

Second, the article paints the man as a quack and self help guru. If you were a professor at a university, established and all, would “self-help guru” do you and your work justice? It neglects to mention that Peterson ran a psychological clinic for 15 years that worked intimately with high-power lawyers in Toronto for. He’s intimately familiar with human behavior - he’s a published psychologist (not the Gorka kind). 

Third, the author doesn’t really rebuke anything Peterson puts forward. He name-checks anti-semitism for some reason, and then ends with a quip about how Marxism is nothing to worry about (Because Mao, Tito, and Stalin were such gentle souls). 

Peterson made it pretty clear that the very fact that his outlook is gaining traction with any audience, 60% male, is a testament to how fucked up society is. He shouldn’t have to be a voice of comfort for anyone, these words of encouragement should come from their immediate social networks (in the non-digital sense). He’s not some alt-right nut. 

The 1:36 VICE News clip is taken totally out of context. The interview was two hours, and there’s 17 minutes on YouTube. Check em out. He doesn’t say anything like this. 

And he sounds nothing like an Islamic Cleric. And it’s a little odd for liberals to invoke Islam in the condemnation of anyone. Peterson never condemns Islam or any specific religion. Quoting the Old Testament isn’t fundamentalist, it’s in the Torah and Quran too. 

https://youtube.com/watch?v=zbDggKqt3KA

If the Gang’s argument is in fact solid and rational, it should be able to withstand an intellectual challenge by Peterson. I know almost all of us side with PSA on this topic, but Peterson really isn’t stupid in the way he formulates this. Watch the video and let me know if PSAs arguments remain unshaken. He really isn't .He literally denounces imposed traditional roles on women. He gets called a misogynist because he, as a sociologist, identifies distinctly "feminine" and "masculine" traits. He doesn't levy a value judgement on either, Peterson only seeks to address how both are required in equal measure and how leaning too far into either one will produce a population replete with social anxiety and mass shooters (which, like, hello).&gt;The 1:36 VICE News clip is taken totally out of context. The interview was two hours, and there’s 17 minutes on YouTube. Check em out. He doesn’t say anything like this.

He said, referring to a video clip, in which he says something very much like what the video clip has him say.

&gt;He name-checks anti-semitism for some reason

"Cultural marxism" is *literally* a Nazi conspiracy theory. Not "Nazi" as in someone I disagree with, "Nazi" as in the National Socialist German Workers' Party that was active in the first half of the twentieth century i Germany. It then was repopularized by people like Pat Buchanan in the 90s. It is *hilariously unambiguously* anti-Semitic.

&gt;And it’s a little odd for liberals to invoke Islam in the condemnation of anyone.

OK now I feel dumb for taking the bait.This is no bait. 

In the video clip he talks with his interviewer about sexual harassment in the workplace, and what factors contribute to its development. There's no value judgement. Applied sociological analysis is not oppressive. Disagree with it, absolutely, but the the minute and thirty six seconds on there is not at all reflective of his opinion, so your disagreeing with VICE's twisted representation of his words.

Marxism in general was not liked by national socialists for a lot of reasons. That doesn't make Marxism good simply because Nazis hate it. He repeatedly condemns (Western) post-modernists, like Louis Althusser and Jacques Derrida, and neo-marxists, like Slavoj Žižek. Not "the jews" or whatever - this is not some alt-right dog whistle. Granted, his alarmism with Marxism seems a bit dated, but its not unwarranted. 

I'm from what was formerly Yugoslavia. Cultural Marxism was not a conspiracy theory - speech with regard to ethnic and religious identity was regulated with the force of law. It's *not* some fascist fever dream. Ceausescu's Romania was a strong employer of Cultural Marxism. Mao was a damn cultural marxist. It's *not* some fascist fever dream.

I can’t reply to this at the moment, but I encourage you to dip your toe into some of his YouTube videos. He’s no villain. He’s a gangly professor with a Kermit-like voice. And he supports powerful women as much as anyone. If he’s still a moron in your view after 10 minutes of serious consideration, fair enough. &gt;so your disagreeing with VICE's twisted representation of his words.

Unless right before the clip he said "by the way, for the next minute and a half I am going to do an impression of a shithead" then I think the video and audio of him speaking words is indeed representative of what he said, and what he said is indeed representative of what he thinks.

Also: he is not a sociologist, and he is certainly not applying sociology.

&gt;Cultural Marxism was not a conspiracy theory 

The term was literally invented by The Nazis and repopularized by paleocons, who identified it with the Frankfurt School and later postmodernism. This is a fact. Neither Tito, nor Ceaucescu, nor Mao used the term "cultural marxism" or promulgated any sort of coherent vision that can be identified with "cultural marxism" or "postmodernism" (which Peterson also talks about despite knowing less than nothing about). This is also a fact. The *fact* that Peterson reached for *that* term is pretty damn telling.

Also: strong suspicion you don't actually know anything about Marx's works.I love your username, and I’m commenting now because I want to remember to answer your post. It’s well structured and brings to light some very salient points. 

I wanted to ask you quickly though - do you think he’s intentionally not reaching out to white men? Is what he’s saying some limiting to minorities? Because I’m not heterosexual, and I’ve never ever felt any animosity from him vis-à-vis the LGBT movement. I apologize, I jumped the gun there. He is absolutely critical of sociology, and sees it as a discipline that is the product of post-modern philosophy. 

With regard to the mass shooters, he says the opposite in his video about mass shooters. He read the manifesto of the Unabomber and others, laying out a thesis that attributes their bitter resent toward their peers and the world around them as hyper-indulgence in a *masculine* trait: anti-social activity. He attributes the extreme end of feminine traits as contributing to anxiety and depression.The goals of liberal identity politics are vitally important, but there are also major pitfalls that must be avoided. At their worst, they can be [strangely compatible with right wing identity politics](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/01/safety-pin-box-richard-spencer-neo-nazis-alt-right-identity-politics). Arguments about cultural appropriation sometimes have merit, but taken to the extreme they can dovetail with the alt-right arguments for an ethno state. And the generalization of entire racial groups can be absolutely alienating and help enforce racial identities.

The answer to this problem is universalism - there is no need to choose between the needs of POC and white working class, in fact you can't fight for one without the other. [From Freddie deBour](http://archive.is/vO21K):

&gt;The basic idea is this: that all people deserve equal rights, material security and comfort, and human dignity by virtue of being human and for no other reason. These things are not deserved, nor can your right to them be fairly taken from you, regardless of what you’ve done, what you believe, and whatever culpability we imagine you might have for your condition.

&gt;...

&gt;Naturally and of necessity, the left has spent a lot of energy focusing on people in traditional marginalized groups, as these groups are those most likely to be denied those basic human entitlements I named above. If you believe that all people deserve equal rights, you will necessarily be a feminist, because those rights are so routinely denied to women. If you believe that all people deserve economic security, you will necessarily fight against racism, because economic security is so routinely denied to people of color. If you believe all people deserve to live lives of human dignity, you will necessarily fight for LGBTQ people, because dignity has so routinely been denied to them. Any political platform that fights to guarantee the rights that I have enumerated here is necessarily feminist, anti-racist, and so on, because the people that suffer from bigotry are those who have been denied them. **That such a platform would also help a white straight man in the destitute corridors of Appalachia could only be perceived as a flaw by those who have fundamentally misunderstood the essential question of contemporary politics. Racism and sexism and homophobia are uniquely pernicious and require our special attention; that special attention presents no conflict at all with our absolute need to help those white or straight or male people who suffer too. Anyone who sees a contradiction between the two halves of that sentence is someone who is not actually committed to the fight for human progress.**
That'd be very good. They have discussed the need to talk about big ideas to deal with our changing economy, but usually that's about as far as they go. At the very least, I'd love to see more leftist guests.They're mostly center-left liberals, but Lovett is somewhere between a [Brandeisian](http://theweek.com/articles/725483/return-trustbusters) and a [Social Democrat](http://theweek.com/articles/726093/bernie-sanders-rise-american-social-democracy).He's on board for Medicare for All - he promised to sign on to Bernie's bill in the senate, but he hasn't signed on to HB 676 because of some provisions about for profit hospitals. I think it'd be fair for leftists not to trust him fully on the issue, but just the fact that someone is competitively running in Texas with a platform that at least nominally includes M4A is good. &gt;And I think Democrats don't necessarily have, none of us have the language to talk about this, and I don't have the language to talk about this

[Psst...hey kid](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/)She didn't explain it well, but she's not wrong. Another mind blowing fact: [the bottom 10 percent owns -0.5 percent of the wealth in the country](http://peoplespolicyproject.org/2017/09/27/new-fed-data-the-top-10-now-own-77-of-the-wealth/) [tldr: it's because of debt].Honest question: have you read much leftist literature? I would be happy to recommend some, from this century even if you insist!

Obviously I can't speak to your situation because I don't know it, but given that smaller classrooms tend to be better whether cutting would actually be better or it it would just be savings for savings' sake?Check out Thomas Frank--he is more left-of-New-Deal than capital-L Left, but I think his recent stuff (like *Listen, Liberal*) has done a good job of laying out a Leftist critique of the Democratic Party, primarily through a historical lens. *Current Affairs* has less breadth and size of coverage than *Jacobin* (like 50% of the articles are by one guy) but it tends to be of more consistent quality. And if you want a good podcast, "Citations Needed" (not "Citation Needed", that's different) is really well made.David Graeber, Bhaskar Sunkara, and Thomas Frank to name three leftists who are pretty media friendly and won't be too antagonistic.

I think the trick is going to find leftists who can resist taking potshots at Obama.Yea all of those would be great - Sunkara did well on the Ezra Klein show a few weeks ago, which was a similar sort of left-liberal interface. But my number one pick would be Elizabeth Bruenig, who just wrote two very approachable articles in WaPo advocating socialism. I'd also be happy with Sean McElwee, Ryan Cooper, or Briahna Gray.While I don't know all of the details, I honestly don't see what's socialist about what your DemSoc acquaintances are pushing in this case. The Left, broadly speaking, is for the universal provision of quality public education at no cost - there isn't anything ideologically baked-in about consolidation of schools assuming that doesn't undermine the quality (which as I understand it, it wouldn't). 

So I think you are right in this case, but I don't think you can extrapolate much about leftist thought based on what a few people think about education policy on a small island. Every ideological group has people making good and bad arguments within it. It's always easiest to pick out the worst ones and skewer them (internet leftists do this all the time tbh) but it's much more intellectually rigorous to try to contend with the best arguments on either side. Ooo, I haven't heard of any of them, gives me some good reading. Also, c'mon, Uncle Noam!

It is just really frustrating that the Overton Window only goes a couple paces to the left, and I don't think the Crooked crew are intentionally a CNN panel dynamic, but it is a really ingrained media habit that I wish they would reflect on.Ah yea, Chomsky would be awesome.

And here are some quick reading recs from each person:

From Sean McElwee: [Abolish ICE](https://www.thenation.com/article/its-time-to-abolish-ice/). 

Briahna Joy Gray: [Racism May Have Gotten Us Into This Mess, But Identity Politics Can’t Get Us Out](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/11/identity-politics-cant-get-us-out-of-the-mess-racism-made.html)

Elizabeth Bruenig: "[It's time to give socialism a try](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/its-time-to-give-socialism-a-try/2018/03/06/c603a1b6-2164-11e8-86f6-54bfff693d2b_story.html?utm_term=.0ad060def53c)" and "[Let's have a good faith argument about socialism](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/lets-have-a-good-faith-argument-about-socialism/2018/03/11/96d66720-23e4-11e8-86f6-54bfff693d2b_story.html?utm_term=.5dc13c4e7df9)".  I'd also recommend checking out her husband Matt Bruenig, who runs [People Policy Project](http://peoplespolicyproject.org/), a patreon-funded leftist think tank, which put out this report on the [destruction of black wealth during the Obama presidency](http://peoplespolicyproject.org/2017/12/07/destruction-of-black-wealth-during-the-obama-presidency/) and this video on [Capital Income](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbSn6o3ZMtw).

Ryan Cooper is prolific in his good takes, so I'd always recommend just looking at [his page on The Week](http://theweek.com/authors/ryan-cooper). But I particularly like his "[Basic Instinct of Socialism](http://www.ryanlouiscooper.com/2016/12/the-basic-instinct-of-socialism.html)" which he expands on [here](http://www.ryanlouiscooper.com/2017/05/socialism-and-welfare-state.html). I also like "[Make Government Simple Again](http://theweek.com/articles/709398/make-government-simple-again)" and "[There is no such thing as deregulation](http://theweek.com/articles/731841/there-no-such-thing-deregulation)". Yea for sure, Tim Faust is one of the best people. His podcast HeavyXMedical is good too, though he hasn't kept it going it seems.Yea very well put. The left does indeed have the language for it, but I don't necessarily think we need to stick with words like "proletariat" and "bourgeoisie" - the 99% and the 1% are simpler and more relatable. But no matter which words they use, people like Lovett seem to know the problem, but is hesitant to make the jump because they aren't comfortable with the words. Hopefully that hesitancy doesn't last, because it's no excuse.

Ady Barkan got the closest to criticizing Obama on PSA, but he was pretty tactful about it. Still one of the best interviews on PSA.Oh right. Well I can't wait for the book!I'm reading "A Generation Of Sociopaths: How the baby-boomers betrayed America" and he articulates why our economy is so fucked up with real data to back him up. We need to make some sweeping changes soon!I quite liked Christman's point here (if there were ever two people who I wanted to see work together, apart from their cohosts, it might be Lovett who is too funny and smart for the PSA guys, and Christman, who is too unfunny and smart for the Chapo guys).

On some level, it is strange to me that we have a demand in the world for video games wherein you go on a crime spree through a reasonably realistic version of Los Angeles, but then I still play GTA. maybe, maybe not. 

the point of the show is to entertain, it's not a GOTV rally. 

You know what definitely doesn't win elections for progressives? Playing into every stereotype of the Democratic Party as a place for elites and those who fancy themselves elites to tut tut tut. She did not invent the term Latinx.

The idea that just because some people Latino/a people don't like it that it is inherently this dumb white people PC bullshit is fallacious. Many, many, many university groups for Latin American students are now named "Latinx" and that change was not forced on them. idk

do you acknowledge the basic concept of white and male privilege? 

It really isn't that hard to separate yourself, as a white man who may understand these things, from "white men" as a concept, who generally refuse to acknowledge them because they want to believe in bullshit myths about meritocracy. probably because Felix is like a one note joke machine who is very bad at expressing his thoughts in a nuanced or concise way. In any given episode of Chapo, the intellectual crux is driven by Matt or Virgil or Amber with Will driving things to a lesser extent. Felix then chimes in to talk about how he wants Lil Yachty to fuck his sideways Asian pussy or something and everyone laughs and then the conversation resumes. 

He is the last person I would send to do a show like LIoLI, which skews toward social justice causes and more mainstream comedy. I loled. 

This sub does seem to become horribly upset any time white people are singled out for any criticism... waiting for the day someone says "DeRay is reverse racist". I don't think the poster really believes that so much as that is what the general perception of "communism" is here. 

It has taken a long time to bring people around to the idea that socialists can implement social democratic reforms like those on display in Northern Europe. It will take a longer time to de-sanitize communism from the stench of Stalin and the Stanlist fanboys who ran the ACP for decades. This is something that, iirc, was said on Chapo once that I really agreed with. 

That the Democratic Party wants to talk about why there aren't more women billionaires instead of stopping and asking why any individual should ever have a billion dollars and what could be done if someone like Oprah's money was redistributed to all women in the country. Means testing tends to be a way to prevent middle class people from benefiting from programs, thus making the program vulnerable politically, and is inherently illiberal in a country founded on the principle of inalienable rights.   And small class sizes are infinitely better for students, so I am not sure why you're taking such an issue with their stance, as though there couldn't be a rationale behind it. 

You're caught up in "waste", but have you considered that putting more kids in a smaller number of schools might actually be bad for the kids? That your island's idea of what peak enrollment and the student teacher ratio should be was initially flawed? I know they get shit on by the far left way more frequently, but I actually think the people at Vox are more open to far left rhetoric and viewpoints than PSA. 

when people say abolish ICE they are not saying "let's not have customs enforcement", stop being obtuse. Or people who know perfectly well what argument that slogan is making could not be willfully obtuse jackwagons fretting about what that would mean for ICE's tribal land coordination office. I think a lot of people here struggle with the idea of broad, hyperbolic solganeering and confuse them for actual policy. Like the guy below who took issue with an article headline calling for ICE to be abolished because "MAH DUTY FREE PURCHASES", it seems many posters here have confused a WOC saying "white men suck" for a literal policy position.

I imagine these same folks fell into the "no, ALL lives matter!" trap. Means testing is absolutely not about finding the best system for anything, as often the best systems for things cost more money than people who want to means test are willing to spend. Universal systems, like Medicare and Social Security, are far less susceptible to political maneuvering than means tested programs like Medicaid and welfare and they tend to produce better outcomes because they are more popular. 

Tell me how a means tested program like FAFSA would produce better outcomes than, say, universal free community college? It is definitely cheaper, but at a cost of everyone who isn't benefiting hating it and it doing nothing to bind people together under a common system with symmetrical rights. Nothing is free, but we don't means test parks or public schools or any other incredibly successful government program.&gt; complaining that young white men are trying and failing to cobble together a movement for self improvement during a time of anomie

Nobody minds that Jordan Peterson tells people to clean their rooms. That's fine. The problem is when he says women are inviting sexual harassment because they wear makeup or that some races are biologically inferior and that anybody disagreeing is part of a (((cultural marxist))) plot.And the average person has their head in the clouds, imagining how they would spend the billion they could theoretically make. Yeah, I think Virgil or Amber would be much better guests on any show than Felix.Liz Bruenig is good as hell. I wish she'd go on and talk about liberalism vs. leftism.Yea absolutely, talking about class is essential. 

And true - I think leftists often write off the upper middle class/PMC, and liberals often use them as an excuse of why Democrats can't move left, but there are both policy and political reasons that isn't true. On policy, the universalism of social democratic reforms tends to help the upper middle class more than liberal means-tested programs. And in terms of politics, look at [Labor winning](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/12/15942870/class-warfare-upscale-suburbs) the super rich Borough of Kensington for the first time ever under Jeremy Corbyn. College educated [people are less likely to feel over-taxed](https://twitter.com/stevenvmiller/status/972922437896728581), even adjusted for income. And people making over 100k [still think the rich and corporations don't pay their fair share](http://www.people-press.org/2017/04/14/top-frustrations-with-tax-system-sense-that-corporations-wealthy-dont-pay-fair-share/). The working class should still be the priority, but leftists shouldn't write off the upper middle class, because like you said, they have more in common with the other members the working class then the capitalists. Why can't both be true?

White working class men have problems and feel disadvantaged and are being fucked over by the wealthy ruling class.

But also they have white privilege that helps them more than their counterparts of other skin colors.lmao same.

damn watching these newly liberal/politically engaged white dudes being forced to confront the idea of white privilege and male privilege is a TRIP.

I'm a white woman who has been a feminist for a decade and yeah it was hard at first to grapple with understanding my white privilege. It's uncomfortable. BUT DEAL WITH IT, MEN.This episode's Ok Stop was WILD. Brittany killed me during it.Yes, it is. Because the man never said anything about *equality* being wrong, but about recognizing when children are being indoctrinated and forced to think a certain way about race or sex at an unreasonably young age. He's not afraid of diversity, you're confusing equity with equality, and he thinks white privilige is rubbish and by extension thinks its erosion is silly. He's not a mysognist. He doesn't seek to create lower the status of women relative to the position of men. 

He just doesnt want the force of law behind language regulation. He doesnt want people who happen to be LGBT or asian or black to act as though they somehow have license to speak on behalf of their whole community, because they don't, no one does unless they've been democratically chosen.He tells them literally, and I mean *literally* the opposite: that it's not societies fault that they're losers and virgins, its theirs. That they haven't undertaken adequate enough responsibility. He literally tells them in his videos to stop blaming society, to carry their own cross and to stop whining about it. To become something more by virtue of their talent.Well we're having an imbalanced discussion here then. If you won't even expose yourself to his content, how can you be sure of your opinion on it? And I don't think that deploring the bitterness and resentment in his manifesto is a reductive way of looking at him, or any lunatic that decides to pen a manifesto before executing a tragedy. And I am of the opinion that his analysis on shooters is apt and accurate. His whole bit is about how men should stop whining that the world is unfair, that they shouldn't lean into their anti social tendencies. He's not some red pill nut. It's not mysognist to say that the reason women wear make up is to simulate sexual attraction, because thats what rouge and lipstick do. This isn't new information. I don't know how to break this to you, but pointing out a fact and then not levying a value judgement isn't misogyny. 

And yeah, I'd love to sit on this hill while you try to pin a man down for being a misogynist. He is all for the empowerment of women. He is all for equal treatment based on fair evaluation of talent. He is all for traditional gender roles if both parties consent to falling within those categories, and he is completely supportive of women who are looking to become top in their fields - he counseled women on career advancement for 15-odd years. 

He's not a red pill misogynist. I mean, after watching him talk you really *can't* peg him as such. All these people are quoting a minute of a vice interview about women in the workplace as evidence of his supposed misogyny - a clinical psychologist attributes workplace harassment to make up. He didn't say "Stop wearing make up", he was exploring its contribution to the problem, and he said we are prevented from having a nuanced discussion about it because we are so fundamentally incapable of walking the delicate line necessary to do so, because we are so prone to descending into either extreme. 

But no one knows this because watching a professor's lectures on youtube and daring to lean into an established understanding of a different political persuasion is somehow taboo. 

EDIT: It should also be mentioned that JBP and Shapiro really do not get along intellectually. They have a debate on youtube you can watch if you're curious. They are in no way one and the same. No, it's not how I feel about either. But if some teacher were to start teaching me at a young age that either is an inimitable pillar of society, that critical discussion about either topic is banned, I would call that indoctrination. 

He's lamenting the fact that alternate perspectives are being censored in when we teach children, that *speech is being regulated*. He'd be furious if a teacher began ignoring climate science or ignoring the theory of evolution in favor of intelligent design. 

I can't defend all of his tweets, and I'm not arguing that he's perfect. But I also think that attributing ~240 characters to the essential nature of a university professor, and then using this to pin him down as a nebulous sort  of racist and mysognist, is absurd. The simple fact of the matter is that he doesn't advocate any sort of race theory, he doesn't seek to diminish the role of women, and he's not advocating for a patriarchal ethnostate. The opposite. He just wants ultimate freedom of thought and the evolution of thought, which, you know, isn't always the best thing imo. But nobody's perfect.

What's worse is that nobody here wants to engage with any of his material. Everyone's so obsessed with tweets and soundbites that actually sitting for 10 minutes to watch what he has to say on women and men as a *psychologist* is somehow "giving in" to the nefarious forces of the right. If he's such a damn idiot then watch his videos and dismantle them. You'd be the first to do so successfully and without condescension. The interesting thing about this comment is... I'm not sure which half you mean. Yea, I like The Weeds podcast. Yglesias can be very good sometimes, and Sarah Kliff is one of the best healthcare reporters. But Ezra Klein is such a stereotypical liberal who propped up Paul Ryan as a reasonable conservative for so long.Hard agree.I certainly don't think we should *create* classes of people - we should be going the opposite direction. But we should be critiquing structural problems in the economy, and one of those already existing structures is class. As I argued above, we should actually explicitly reach out to richer people - I think they are more fertile ground than many leftists believe. So that necessarily means not being antagonistic to individuals. But that doesn't mean you can't say that you're going to ask the millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share. &gt;I also can't take The Week seriously when according to them Tim Kaine and Doug Jones are racist.

You know The Week is a publication that publishes a wide variety of opinion articles from all perspectives, right?

And Tim Kaine and Doug Jones did just vote for a bill that rolls back regulations [meant to curb racial discrimination](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/03/12/the-senate-is-poised-to-roll-back-rules-meant-to-root-out-discrimination-by-mortgage-lenders/?utm_term=.69f08f3c4ab0) in mortgage lending. I certainly don't think either man is personally racist, but the effect of that will no doubt be to further racial discrimination.Yea, no one disagrees with helping out the credit unions and community banks. That bill would have gotten 90+ votes in the senate. But that's not the problematic part.

&gt;making an inference that rolling back the detailed data reports these banks are forced the comply with will eventually lead to racial discrimination.

Do you think this inference is unreasonable? [Redlining is currently happening](https://www.revealnews.org/article/for-people-of-color-banks-are-shutting-the-door-to-homeownership/), it's not some far off thing. Collecting data that banks already have on the computer shouldn't be onerous, it's just a few extra lines in a spreadsheet. These reporting requirements were added to Dodd Frank because the existing ones weren't doing enough - going back to the old system, which was proven to not work, doesn't make sense.I mean... the point of Ok, Stop isn't to be like "hm ok let's have a nuanced break down of this".

But idk. I just didn't see much to actually engage with in that segment. The flat out denial of systemic racism and sexism is just... it's hard to work with that.I think our time is better spent energizing and organizing more friendly demographics who just need the push to vote than to try to argue with white men and privilege when they don't want to see it. It's mostly a waste of time.[Elrond was right tbh!](https://m.popkey.co/b43a1d/kWWOl.gif)

More seriously though, an example of male and white privilege is that apparently the burden is on women and people of color to be patient with the privileged and explain to them why they're wrong even though they don't want to hear it. And then we get blamed for their wrongness! I'm tired. I'm just so tired of it.

So fuck that. Let's reframe it. A bad attitude from people sick of being shit on is not why Trump won. Trump won because privileged people are defensive as fuck about it.Being a woman makes it more okay though. Long as you have a less privileged label you're gucci. Being a white male is sort of the antithesis, being both white and male. I don't think your experiences can relate though. You being a woman, even a white one. Offers that caveat that a white man doesn't have.It seems though that the legitimate issues white men, or men in general have are dismissed out of hand because they have less issues overall. Which I think is where a lot of the frustration comes from.Synopsis: DeRay, Brittany, Sam and Clint discuss a new study on the rapid spread of fake news on Twitter, the racial wealth gap, arming teachers, and WA’s new deadly force legislation. Author and musician Gyasi Ross catches up with DeRay to discuss the DNC 2020 and issues facing Native communities.

Synopsis: House Republicans end their Russia investigation, Trump sides with the NRA on gun control, Conor Lamb eyes an upset in Pennsylvania, and Democrats look for the missing Obama voters. Then Texas State House candidate Julie Johnson joins Jon, Jon, Tommy, Dan, and Brittany live on stage in Dallas, Texas. 

Great opportunity for Tommy to get a PSTW guest like Ronan Farrow who literally wrote a book about the chaos and decline in the state department though!

But yeah, the news is always happening and I'm wondering its an issue of timing/lack of flexibility on their parts or that feeling you get in a cab headed towards the airport like you are hitting all the red lights possible. pre-order War on Peace on Amazon etc etcJulie Johnson was a delightful interview and the game at the end was very funny. That's not whataboutism. All of those things were topics specifically discussed in this podcast. Right after the video game discussion they played a game talking about movie awards. It's a direct comparison of the topics. Nice try though.Ronan's Instagram has plenty of couple-y pics of them at weddings, events and Thanksgiving/Christmas. Not the hardest guest to get a hold of for CM but I also wouldn't be surprised if Ronan's team had a VERY detailed plan on how to best do promo for his book/HBO show and the number of CM appearances and when. Johnson's opponent won in 2016 by 1.8%.

flip flip flipCool! I thought she was a little goofy and not particularly talking like a politician but she was herself, seemed to be having a fun time and clearly wasn't sticking to market-tested talking points. What did you find cringe-worthy? Agree to disagree then! I think she did talk about identity but she was also explicitly asked about it, so, you know. I don't exactly know if a ten minute interview is really enough to deep dive into her positions.

Plus, I'm a lesbian who loves being pandered to - ie, a relatively recent trend of people not seeing LGBT+ identity disqualifying you from public life. Its nice to see that side of people being talked about and openly cheered. Trump supporters are definitely racist, and race was probably the primary factor in Trump's victory, but no matter how you spin it, reality is always going to be complicated. 

Do you agree with Lovett that there are structural problems in the economy, with the lack of wage growth and broadly shared gains? I honestly am so tired of the live eps. I love the guys and that the podcast is doing so well, but it’s completely changed from its original format now. It’s on it’s way to being a touring show with the occasional studio episode. I get that live shows are way more profitable and exciting for them to do, but they must understand how it’s not as good for someone listening at home. The best ones have been the Europe ones because they didn’t feel like pep rallies and just a room of a lot of people agreeing with each other very loudly. Dan always brings it back to Earth a bit when he’s there but they’ll never be as good as the studio eps imo. Also known as benevolent sexism.Putting women on a pedestal and expecting them to be better than men and idealizing us is also harmful. &gt; -Angry White Men: American Masculinity at the End of an Era, Michael Kimmel (This book pretty much called the white, frustrated, alt-right Trump supporter phenomenon back in 2013)

This book is *so good*.It's a very common and generic line for gay comedians. Not saying that means the reference should continue, but I'm sure there wasn't any thought behind it at all.I really love Erin RyanPlease don't start spamming random articles on this sub. You just posted two. I might agree with the content but neither of them have anything to do with Crooked Media. This isn't r/politics or r/bluemidterm2018. Post articles from the Crooked team instead. Synopsis: Democrats win another special election, Republicans flail around for a response, and Trump sends Tillerson to the Rexit in a major shakeup of the national security team. Then Lovett and Tommy talk to Senator Elizabeth Warren.

I haven't listened yet, but I kept finding it weird that she didn't just go with: "My family had said for years we had Native blood, and unfortunately it didn't pan out that way. I apologize, and I will continue to speak out in favor of helping or Native American friends."Yes, absolutely. Whenever these moments come up when a guest or guest host is playing to the crowd super hard and getting lots of easy applause breaks, I feel like the guys know that it's not really the point of the pod but are aware of the criticism they've gotten before for being 'four white guys hosting a podcast about politics in 2017/18', so they feel like they can't even come close to criticising it or curbing that. I thought I had seen something before about how a blood test didn't reveal any. But you can still pivot out either way.

EDIT: Also, this "controversy" is a mere speck compared to the garbage pile Trump is sitting on at the moment, so no one should seriously weigh this against whatever else is going on at the moment.Synopsis: Tommy giddily discusses Rex Tillerson’s firing by tweet with Politico foreign affairs correspondent Nahal Toosi. Then they discuss suspected assassination of Putin enemies in London and Nahal’s exclusive report about Trump administration attacks on career State Department staffers.

I thought that was a really good interview. Warren continues to be in a difficult spot on this: it's clear by now that she had been told she was part Native-American her entire life by her family and had assumed that was true. She probably has done the research by now and knows that it was *not* true, but she can't admit that without seemingly throwing her own family under the bus in favor of Donald fucking Trump. What would you do in that scenario? I don't think she's ever going to come up with a satisfactory answer, so I don't see how she ends up as president or vice-president. There's nothing wrong with that though, she's one of the best senators there is.I didn't know they were dating, but I think most people listen to these podcasts with the knowledge that they're all shilling for each other and I'm fine with that.My understanding is that her family claims Native descent from before the advent of tribal rolls, which is how we currently trace such things "officially". 

That being said, SO MANY families have these myths of Cherokee ancestry. I know medical doctors who refuse to believe in DNA testing because it doesn't confirm that their families, whose history in the US only goes back about 100 years and was spent entirely in Michigan, were somehow part Cherokee. Yes, so because of GamerGate nobody should ever bring up basic journalistic ethics ever again. 

Good job, you won the internet today. &gt; Dan is great and wicked smart, but I sometimes think the combination of him and Favs can be dull.

I agree. Imo the sort of dullness that can be there at times when it's just Favs and Dan is largely Favs fault. I might be imagining it but often when I listen to the Thursday pod (especially when watching video of it if available) Jon looks exhausted and almost bored because the last pod he did was with the other guys and was obviously full of energy and way more laughs and less analysis than the Thursday pod. I almost get the impression Favs is annoyed that the other guys aren't there and it's just Dan, but I don't know. Yeah, though I think Lovett could have helped more and fed her the example of a correct answer like he does to others at times. The deaths due to ICE is the one that is hitting me the most. 6 kids who are now orphans because their parents were farming. Disgusting.Synopsis: McCabe gets axed, Tillerson is dethroned, Conor Lamb wins in an upset, and students walk out to protest gun violence. Plus Elizabeth Holmes is very good at seeming like she’s not a criminal and United Airlines seems to be run by a house cat. LeVar Burton and comedians Marcella Arguello and Jamie Lee join Jon to break down the week’s news. And Westworld’s Shannon Woodward stops by to help us understand what’s gone wrong with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

This isn't mentioned on the pod but Lovett had an antibiotic-resistant infection from a cut on his leg that landed him in the hospital and did the show on Percocet. Barely noticed, get better Lovett etcThank you for putting into words so eloquently what I could not. I stopped arguing here because one, I wasn’t in the mood to defend Peterson’s belief to people who haven’t taken the time to listen or read his work (some guy above said Peterson is telling boys society is to blame for their problems, which is the OPPOSITE of what he’s saying!) and two, it’s incredibly demoralizing to be talked to as though I am not that far ideologically from Carlson or Hannity. I’m Liberal, basically socialist, but no longer “in” because I have an opinion on this professors work that diverges from the norm. 

More directly to your point I want to refer you to a comment I read a while ago on Reddit after the election that I think you might enjoy:

&gt; Looks like Russia finally helped the Democrats deliver on their promise of transparency.

&gt;What is sad about the Dems is that at a time when they should be introspecting, they're looking to shift blame for their own failures, ensuring that the DNC establishment doesn't actually change. This election wasn't actually a referendum on Trump, it was a referendum on what passes for the modern representatives of the liberal left in America, the Democratic party.

&gt;They're blaming the loss on everything, from sexism of Bernie supporters to Russia to fake news to everyone who voted against them being stupid. The left finally got an actual populist that talked about actual real issues like trade deals, stopping monopolies and putting term limits on Congress, and what did the DNC do? They crushed him to continue the failed policies of the liberal establishment.

&gt;They have abandoned their core principles. What passes for "liberal" today in America has almost nothing to do with classic liberalism (individual rights, freedom of thought/speech...etc). The qgreat liberal tradition that rejects regressive dogmatic ideologies and which is compassionate to the working class stiffs that build the country is now gone. The left-wing movement in this country, at least going back the last 20 years or so, hasn't really been one of left-wing economics or individualistic free thinking, or using government to improve the lives of the working and middle classes. What's passed for left-wing politics in this country is really just identity politics: promising to give various handouts to some identifiable minority group (blacks, women, illegal immigrants, lgbt...etc). 

&gt;**Democrats, you have completely and utterly lost touch with the common man, whose concerns used to be at the very center of the political left**. 

&gt;Today that electrician stringing up wires of homes in Wisconsin, that welder putting together steel plates in Pennsylvania, that man fixing an elevator in Ohio, the many men across the country with dirt under their nails from working with their hands....these aren't your people anymore.

&gt;Instead you are now the party of the gender studies graduate with manicured nails, lecturing others about the evil racist sexist America, telling the struggling white working class that they hold white privilege and therefore hold an eternal debt to all non-white people based purely on the color of their skin.

&gt;The DNC is the the party of those who go absolutely nuts when a Christian baker doesn't want to be forced to bake a cake for a gay wedding, yet instantly jumps in to defend insanely backwards ideologies like Islam when yet another Muslim mass murders innocent homosexuals.

&gt;It is the party of collusion with media to mislead the public, of corruption and saying nice empty platitudes that have been filtered through 5 focus groups as to not offend anyone while doing the very opposite of these platitudes.

&gt;It is the party of Black Lives Matter, the oppression Olympics, of 20 different gender pronouns, virtue signalling and all the noxious ideas like "social justice" that claim that all difference in outcome must be due to some etheral discrimination, and that places the collectivist forced equality of outcome over the rights of an individual.

&gt;It is the party of the smug air of moral superiority, of ivory tower attitudes holding contempt and instantly discounting the views of regular people that don't hold a degree studying Critical Theory or the works of Juddith Butler.

&gt;And what has this disconnect lead to? The following:

&gt;* Republicans have won a majority in the House of Representatives, with 238 seats.
* Republicans have won the majority in the Senate.
* Republicans now hold 33 Governorships, with a gain of three seats on November 8.
* Republicans control a record 68 of 98 state legislative chambers.
* Republicans now hold more total state legislature seats, well over 4,100 of the 7,383, than they have since 1920
* A former reality TV star with no government experience whatsoever won the White House.
* President Trump will have one Supreme Court vacancy to fill immediately and could potentially add at least two more justices before his first term is finished.

&gt;The GOP now controls all levels of our government, it is the most powerful it has been in over 80 years according to Real Clear Politics and Washington Post.

&gt;Come the midterms in 2018, the electorate map looks really good for the GOP and they could easily win enough seats to pass the threshold needed for them to start changing the Constitution completely unopposed.

&gt;You could have prevented this. You could have kicked out the out of touch elitists and candidates that can't connect with the average person, you could have listened to the common man instead you treated them like utter garbage, with the insufferable arrogance of guilt tripping and shaming everyone who disagrees with your identity politics nonsense. 

&gt;You made this bed. 

&gt;And god damn do you deserve to now sleep in it.

/u/SultryTo be fair, race is also a social construct. I don't agree at all that it's a valid comparison, but it's not like race is a biological fact. 

Also, sex is absolutely not a social construct. Chromosomes are biological facts, however gender and gender roles are entirely constructed. Synopsis:Trump begins publicly attacking Robert Mueller, only a few Republicans in Congress speak out, and Trump data firm Cambridge Analytica harvests data from 50 million Facebook profiles. Then Stoneman Douglas High School students David Hogg and Jackie Corin talk to Tommy and Jon about the upcoming March for Our Lives and their efforts to prevent gun violence. 

Between this, the Current Affairs article, and the Time Magazine interview, I really hope we are seeing the end of the brief period in which Peterson was treated as a Serious Thinker.I've used similar terms forever and my brother is paralyzed. There's no intent behind it, it's just a saying at this point. Should it be corrected? Absolutely, but I guarantee you it came from a place of ignorance and not malice. It's hard to get terms we think are innocuous out of our lexicon.I don't disagree, but I don't think it's reflective of Tommy's character or how progressive or not progressive he is either.These Parkland kids are SO damn smart.

It's awful that they had to live through a school shooting, but they took that harrowing experience and are using it to make some real changes. They understand social media because they grew up with it and they are using it very effectively. Unlike the survivors of Sandy Hook, these kids are old enough to speak out for themselves and they're doing it.&gt;"Midget" is as offensive as the "n" word...

No. Are you guys deleting Facebook? I've had it since 2004 or 2005 and I'm conflicted about throwing all of those memories away, but I also don't use it much anymore and I'm really sick of their shit.My suggestion was a Pod featuring Dems from various places on the political spectrum within the party having a conversation with each other. I think it’s important to understand where other Dems are coming from and what their positions are and then also to understand where you agree. I think understanding the commonalities will help with uniting the party and hopefully we can learn to understand and respect the places where we differ. I can't see any of them?And he's already been on PSTW which was a big eyeroll from me. &gt; I'm somebody who would rather chew glass than watch or listen to anything remotely political, be it left- or right-leaning.

I used to be like this.

Then I got jolted and realized what I actually think about the world and now I can't NOT listen something political at some point every couple days.If we don't nuke the filibuster, every sensible bill will be Joe Liebermaned



Everything in the article needed to be done before 2010, but Dems had dragged their feet trying to appeal to the GOP. 



My idea is that it the Republicans want a seat at the table, then they need to negotiate in good faith, no more 'honest debate' where they aren't going to vote for the bill anywaysIt’s nuts. This is the sort of shit Shapiro and Peterson get us on: we’re total hypocrites when it comes to Saudi Arabia. They’re some of the most radical, women-can’t-leave-unless-a-male-accompanies-them, cut-the-hands-off-thieves, extremist nations ever. Not to mention the agent of chaos that they’re playing as in Yemen. 

It’s a fucking shit show. I’m glad we’re not above levying criticism on these guys we like. This was not a good luck for either of them. America has let so much shit slide in SA because they’re our “partners in peace” in the Middle East. It’s revolting, and the way that Tommy of all people, that pillar or decency and morality, is willing to downplay their extremism is gross. 

It’s hypocrisy, and it leaves him and us on the Left in general vulnerable to the honest criticisms of hypocrisy. “Equality for women everywhere, NOW! Except Saudi Arabia, we can wait with that one”. Yeah, but I feel as Tommy isn’t a government agent anymore and should therefore be more concerned with liberalization of Saudi culture. But it turns out he’s fine with it being an Islamic conservative shitshow as long as America gets a hot tip on where to drone next. I want to chime in and answer a rebuttal I often hear from people abojt Saudi Arabi.
The line is always something along the lines of "a partner in peace" or a "ally of necessity".

My rebuttal is that any actions with a Saudi regieme which acts repressively at home and provides the most funds for Islamic extremism of amy nations is necessarily a negative peace. We must acknowledge that any peace axhieved with the Saudis as an ally is merely the absence of a response to our unjustified violence. To solve international problems, actions need to address the causes of conflict, not eliminate unruly populations.I disagree with PSTW by FAR the most out of all the pods and a lot of it is because Tommy never pushes back against US foreign policy interests because he doesn't want to. He was a spokesman, not a wonk, who's job was to defend US interests and military actions. Interviews with interesting and good people are good interviews because he lets them talk - Arwa Damon still stands out as a great interview.  

Maybe Kara Swisher should offer a course on how to do actually tough interviews. Mm, maybe! Especially with foreign policy interviews considering there's less incentive considering the relative lack of interest from the general public in foreign policy and how most decisions in foreign policy are made quietly and with little input from the public.

But there's a degree of - they've been doing this for over a year, they are VERY popular and people who want to be interviewed might consent to harder questions if they think they can answer the questions and gain a larger audience.  Are we supposed to take r/ESS's love of race science to be ironic, as well?Synopsis: Trump congratulates Putin on an election well-rigged, loses his head lawyer, and Congress does nothing to protect Mueller while the corruption scandals keep coming. Then Senator Mark Warner joins Jon and Dan to talk about the Mueller investigation, Cambridge Analytica, Facebook, and his thoughts on the banking bill. I think they've @'ed the guys on twitter about stuff they've talked about on the pod.Warner is going to play a major part in the eventual Senate trial of Trump to remove him from office, so I get wanting to stay on his good side. He's also been an excellent guest in the past.It's not like that's hard to find. Turn on any cable news channel, including MSNBC, and GOP talking points won't be hard to find.It's not that so much as no Democrat wants to go on the most influential Democratic platform available at the moment and get into an argument. It's just not beneficial to anyone. Softballs and limiting actual arguing is just safer.I don't think we got Trump because Crooked Media didn't push hard enough on their Democratic guests but YMMV.Now that's true. It's not beneficial for senators or Crooked Media though.Synopsis: On this week’s episode, we welcome Jon Lovett, one of the co-hosts of Pod Save America and host of Lovett or Leave It. Lovett explains to us how he got into Star Wars with the Special Editions, why he loves Rogue One and what motivates his political activism. Jon also offers his thoughts on a potential Star Wars political drama, that Hagerman dude who went off the grid to avoid Trump and Saw Gerrera. On Beltway Banthas, Stephen and Swara discuss politics, Star Wars, and all the ways they intersect. On this episode we also discuss the DC snow storm, climate change and how we feel about the March for our Lives event weekend. To close we read and respond to listener email on last week’s episode on fascism and the First Order.

The interview Lovett starts at 8:42Synopsis: Trump hires John Bolton, congratulates Putin, attacks Mueller, loses his lawyer, and confronts very detailed accounts of marital affairs and efforts to cover them up. Plus, young people lead a march against gun violence, Mark Zuckerberg defends Facebook on TV, and Cynthia Nixon it turns out is not the character she played on Sex and the City. Recorded live in DC, Symone Sanders, Wesley Lowery, and Mitra Jouhari join Jon to break down a week of news that somehow seems more packed with crazy than usual, if that's possible.

You don't think Lovett adding "we hate each other" was relevant to a comment you claimed was fawning?if you are expecting a podcast explicitly about Stars Wars to offer valuable political discussion relevant to idk, the real world? that is totally on youSo uh, here's the thing maybe that'll make you look like you actually listened to the podcast itself instead of just promoting CTH!

It wasn't a PSA or even a Crooked Media podcast. It was an interview on a podcast about Star Wars. Questions like "How did you first watch Star Wars" and "So you liked Rogue One!" etc.Very productive, thank you asking with. Helped register people to vote. Sure, I live in a blue state but we had quite a few people from red or purple districts come into my city for the march plus we should encourage voting even in "safe" blue districts. 

Just a bit worried you might have actually clicked a wrong link and I'd like to make sure you actually got to the podcast I linked since your comments seem to indicate you listened to a PSA podcast instead of a podcast about Star Wars and I'd sure love to make sure you actually listened to the podcast that included political questions like: do you think a Star Wars series about the daily machinations of the Senate would be interesting etcSynopsis: Trump becomes even more unhinged, and makes warmonger John Bolton his national security advisor. Then Jon, Jon and Tommy attend the March for Our Lives in D.C. and meet students, teachers, and families from around the country who want to stop gun violence. 

Beef Gang 4everI was bowled over by the doctor who said there's a law that prohibited doctors from talking to their patients about guns. Like it honestly is a public safety issue. Not just for depressed or suicidal patients, but also just talking to parents of child patients about how they store their guns. Just like we talk about children needing car seats to be safe, gunowners who are parents need gun safes that their children cannot access to keep their kids safe.Definitely a top 3 Britney song.&gt; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is introducing legislation to legalize hemp and remove it from the list of controlled substances. After a long day, McConnell and his wife, Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, like to relax by putting on a record and enjoying some rope.

This one got an audible reaction from me.He looks like when the Coneheads try to act casual but way overcompensate.The problem is just that Republicans do not care about compromise. They are direct obstructionists who abuse their minority to destroy common sense legislation. By nuking the filibuster, any Republicans like Mconnel, Cotton, Cruz, etc. cannot hijack any bill with bad faith demands. For fuck sake McConnell filibustered HIS OWN BILL. If any Republicans want a seat at the table, they need to propose sensible changes to the bill. One day, the Crooked Media boys will ask a follow-up question of someone they like.

But today is not that day.Well Biden is from Delaware and has a long history of looking out for the big-money interests in his backyard. So I understand his defense of it.

cites Brookings

uh...Tim Ryan may be a blue-collar pro-union guy but he is definitely NOT leftist.Couldn’t agree more. Their guests are fine at times, but giving someone this unique platform implies an underlying understanding that it won’t be used as a soapbox, that the spirit of the show demands some sort of honest or forthcoming conversational style. Some people really lean into this, others just don’t seem to get it. Biden and Warren both missed the mark these last couple of weeks. 

I like it when they bring people on who they disagree with. The questions get sharper, the hosts shine, and the opposition gets knocked back a step of two. 

But like you said, I’d much rather hear them talk amongst themselves and have a guest every other week. Maybe that’d be a two-birds-one-stone solution. A solid PR puff-piece from the boys at the PSA.UBI isn't a solution to anything, though. Truck driving is one of the most common jobs in the United States (I think it is *the* most common job in most states) and earns a median salary of about $40k a year. It is also one of the most obvious targets for automation, as soon as self driving car systems get worked out (probably in a few years) that whole occupation s toast. Meanwhile, the standard proposal for UBI (or NIT) is something like $10k a year, which is destitution pay as opposed to the solid middle class pay of a truck driver. If you think there is a coming crisis of automation, UBI does not solve it.Tommy and Glenn Greenwald was good. Deray and Ed Snowden. Definitely Ady Barkan on PSA. I liked Julissa Arce's Crooked Convo with Cenk Uygur. But the list is small. Not voting for Hillary was a vote for Trump. You fucked up by playing purity games. If you didn't want Hillary, you should have voted her out in the primary‘The tea party rallies were always angry events with people yelling on tv... I didn’t see that at the Women’s March and I didn’t see that the the March for our Lives’

Really, Jon? Both events were very well organized and overall certainly peaceful, but there was definite (justified) anger in spades. I feel like the hosts sometimes go out of their way to draw positive comparisons for these big movements where they might not be accurate or appropriate. Sorry, what is ‘punching left’? Like pandering to the far left? Ah ok. Thanks. Oh my god... I'm like 15 minutes in and the teen girl she's talking to... I CANNOT. I would lock my hypothetical child in their room if they started talking like that.

I mean, I assume her parents agree with her since they liked Nazi dude enough to let her go to CPAC to meet up with him.

But oh my god....She's probably been raised in a conservative Christian household, and I'm guessing that she relishes being contrarian and controversial. She's an irl edgelord.Agree completely. It's really a shame because I feel the tone of the podcast has changed a lot from when it was Keepin' it 1600 and even just half a year ago. I think they were really stung by criticism of some prominent voices on the left that they're 'four white guys hosting a political podcast in 2017/18' and some other instances of similar criticism, and now it feels like they way overdo it sometimes to be always inclusive and never at all critical of anything progressive.I also liked this more than most from last season.I generally think more in terms of changing the economic dynamics that makes surplus production neccesary and thus abolishing property altogether. Don't want to get caught in labor voucher nonsense.

Anyway, when did all the commies come around ere? I love it.Synopsis: Trump’s lawyer allegedly floated pardons. Trump’s lawyer’s lawyer is not doing much better. The census is under attack. And this White House can turn any adult into Benjamin Button. Comedians Emily Heller and Jaboukie Young-White and journalist Seema Mehta join Jon to break down the week’s news and celebrate Melania’s victory over cyber-bullying.

I sometimes joke that there is a division between people who come to the left through academia and those who come through Adbusters, I feel like Chapo probably deserves its own category. I used to be pretty cool on the podcast (subreddit seems good though), but I have been recommending it a lot after seeing how many people have turned left with it.I agree. I think we should have a long-term goal of repealing the Second Amendment. Yes, we can legally put in gun control now, but it's bigger than that. If we want gun CULTURE in this country to change, we need to take its enshrinement out of our constitution. I do understand it isn't politically wise for people with influence to talk about doing it in 2018 though, because that's one of the few things that could Republicans out to vote in November.There's a difference between wanting the Second Amendment repealed and wanting a gun ban or anything approaching a gun ban.Saying a 2nd Amendment repeal would equal a gun ban makes as much sense as saying the repeal of Prohibition meant the government was saying alcohol was awesome. No, a repeal is just a repeal. Guns are the only objects that get this holy enshrinement into the constitution and will continue to be seen with religious fervor so long as the 2nd Amendment is there. The only other countries that have something similar to the 2nd Amendment in their constitutions are Mexico and Guatemala, but that doesn't mean guns are illegal throughout the rest of the world does it?

You can frame it as something politically unwise to build a platform on in 2018 (and I agree!), but saying this shouldn't be the ultimate goal 20, 30, 40 years from now is incorrect.There is zero evidence that the slight generic ballot dip has anything to do with gun control. The slip started almost as soon as the GOP passed the tax overhaul back in December. The generic ballot advantage was at 6.5% the day of the Parkland shooting and is at 6.5% today.Same, unless it is released by the time I get in my car to leave work Monday afternoon (that's pretty rare now). Then I'll listen to the first part on the way home, but usually it's a Tuesday morning show for me.I think it might have been hyperbole to say that he makes a shit ton of money. Which he does, shilling his snake oil nonsense.

Though maybe there is more of an exact number out there from his divorce and custody hearings.Objectively it's probably for the best.

But personally.... I miss my Monday pod!!!It might be his gross income from his viewers/ads/etc., not his net income after expenses and paying other people on his site.Ah, cool! I guess I overestimated how valuable YouTube is lol. I had no idea there were the profit calculators available! Thanks for the heads-up :)Dreamers are people who were brought here as children and to qualify for DACA they have to meet certain requirements. They're in school or working. They're contributing to our society. So imo, our country is a better place for having them here and we should offer them citizenship if they want it.Synopsis: Stacey Dash’s congressional bid comes to a halt. Grindr gets caught sharing users’ HIV statuses. Advertisers bail Laura Ingraham’s show like the Titanic. Roseanne is back on the airwaves and Trump couldn’t be more excited. Plus, Ana Marie Cox joins Ira to discuss this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference and comedian Cameron Esposito stops by to discuss how we frame queer stories.

Tommy Vietor, during the day of and days following the massacre, has actually written several tweets decrying the Israelis and spreading word about the killings. [Here is his first tweet I could find on it](https://twitter.com/TVietor08/status/980173827253583872), and if you look at his timeline he shares several other videos and articles about the massacre. He has also retweeted several journalists covering it. Pretty sure it's Horray for Hollywood mixed. I never really noticed how they were saying it, but remember they were speechwriters/spokesmen. They're used to choosing their words very carefully, and will err on the more "professional" side.
They’re definitely far left I think, not radically so but I don’t know how you can think they’re not. They always talk about their frustration with prominent Democratic politicians resisting very progressive ideas in favor of more centre left approaches, and always voice support for super Left ideas. I don’t know if I’ve ever heard them express disdain for something extremely progressive or promote centrist ideas over very left ones. Synopsis: Tommy talks with New Yorker writer Robin Wright about Putin’s possible visit to Washington, his relationship with Trump, and what we know about Trump the negotiator vs what’s required for success. Then they discuss Robin's visit to North Korea, the situation in Gaza, Syria and John Bolton.

My absolute favorite PSTW are always with journalists so I'm pumped. It's perfectly fine to enjoy both, and enjoying both has made my life better! :)Totally agree! I don't need CTH stuff discussed here. I just wanted to say that liking one person's impression doesn't require someone to be 'the other guy does it better'. Just enjoy both, it's so tiring to compare.Synopsis: Mueller’s writing a summer blockbuster, Fox and Friends is making immigration policy, and Scott Pruitt is late for dinner. Then the Rev. Demetrius Jifunza of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition joins Jon, Jon, Tommy, and Dan on stage in Clearwater, Florida to talk about voting rights and second chances.

I've come to realize I'm okay with the news portion of live shows, but guest segments tend to be worse, especially if it's a politician, and especially if it's a politician currently campaigning.I like the live shows! But I can see how some people don't so I suppose I'm part of the problem for a lot of fans who seem to despise them. They make a nice break occasionally and it seems to be when they get local community activists the most (outside of PSTP)I don't think we should be worrying too much about this now, but my preference is Warren.

I voted Sanders in '16, and am not opposed to another run, but there are structural things he needs to address to alleviate some worries. But he and Warren are pretty tight, and I think if she told him she was going to make a run then he would probably endorse her.

I know Biden is a big draw for some of these congressional races, and god knows we love the guy, but I'm not sure he's the right choice. I fear he will try to puff up his chest to Trump and it won't go over well, plus he seems a little resistant to the party moving left (he said in his pod episode the parties are lurching towards the poles, and not in a good way).

Gillibrand's stock has risen in my book over the past year. I fear some people will attack her for being opportunist (spearheading the Al Franken resignation, switching gun control stances after going to the senate) but she has explained her choices very well. I would have no problem at all if she ran or was the nominee.

Booker I'm not super high on, though I support his criminal justice reforms. He is up in 2020 so it would be a gamble, and he's young enough that he can afford to pass on this cycle.

Harris I still don't know as much about. Seems like a perfectly fine candidate who fits in somewhere between Sanders and Clinton. But again, she can afford to bide her time and get more than 2/3 of a senate term under her belt (I realize Obama did this and it worked out well, but if you had asked me in April 2006 I would have said give him more time). 

I'm of the opinion that once you've lost a general election there are no second chances. That means you, Hillary, Kerry, and Gore. Primary losers, however, doesn't matter. Saddle up if you want.

John Delaney- lol

There's a bunch of other people I'd be okay with, but I'd need more concrete evidence they were considering it before I give them a serious look. Just please not actors or business people.

And before anyone says, "x already said no", NOTHING matters until the day after the midterm. There is even a clip of Obama in like 2006 saying directly that he is not running. It's irrelevant.That's understandable. PSA is never where I'm going to get my news from or learn about the inner workings of the government, but I find the show very compelling to clarify certain positions and just sort of as catharsis. I've also been to the live shows and find them really fun so I think that helps with my enjoyment. So long ago - in 2013 - HRC was the most popular politician in America. With that in mind, I'm not really ready to plant my flag, like, literally anywhere because things change rapidly and become entrenched long-term wisdom. 

I'd love Gillibrand to run - single-payer healthcare, a long record of being active about sexual assault, a convincing argument about her switch on issues such as gun control. 

But there's plenty of others - Warren, Harris, Murphy - etc I wouldn't be unexcited to see run. Who puts forward the best plans during the primary etc. I want a healthy and competitive Democratic field that pushes each other to the left without eating our young. 

Biden is a worse Hillary


Creepy around girls

Super centrist when we need progressives

War Hawk

Promotes work based welfare



His charity and mission with cancer is great, but shouldn't run for presidentHer pro-ICE stance is awful and I'm not sure she has a great understanding of foreign policy.This is pretty spot-on with O'Malley. He's been in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina courting local activists for years and is STILL visiting. There's some speculation that his 2016 run was done knowing he'd lose the nomination but to build networks with local activists.I'd love to see Biden working on cancer research and funding in a Dem administration, but I don't need him as president.Well, it certainly could be a reading error on my part - but according to a Quinnipiac poll from 2013 she was actually VERY well liked - 61 - 34 percent favorability. Gallup has her popularity in the low to mid 60s from the time of her concession to Obama to past her departure as Secretary of State to a rapid drop when she started running for presidency. I don't actually think these polls MEAN anything when someone isn't actively running for office.

Perhaps I'm just talking around what I HOPE is my point and caution that popularity polls outside elections &amp; campaigns don't have enough of an influence to tell us who would be a good candidate. RN we don't have Democrats running against each other nor do we have a single Democrat for the Republicans to decide must be THE enemy and to turn their massive propaganda outlets against. Till we do, we have to proceed with caution that even a seemingly very good or popular candidate won't face massive problems.I'm a socdem, so I love Bernie and Warren. But, they are too old and we need someone youngerRight now I want it to be someone I haven't heard of yet. I'm voting all Ds 'cause the alternative is all worse. But I'm really sick of the current dems too. He is part of the status quo with US foreign policy. The US has a tendency to disguise Imperialism as "spreading democracy". We need a leader who will...

-Drastically cut the Military budget

-Increase soft power by building infrastructure instead of forcing regime change

-Stop selling weapons to the Saudis and Israel! (End the death in Yemen, and the murder of protesting Palestine people)

-Reduce drone strikes and military presence in the Middle East




Now for your other question. Biden has been caught on camera and on video of forcing hugs, inappropriate contact, and unwarranted attention to young girls/women. Look up photos of him and I think you will be shocked. I think he has the same issues as Franken, he didn't really do anything terrible (relatively) but did inappropriate things to enough people that it established a behavioral pattern.


Joe might be that fun uncle who has a passion to continue his vision on figuring cancer, but he would not make a great progressive president.We should be skeptical of all polls, absolutely. British polling in particular is unreliable. The Brexit poll less so than the 2015 general election, but all the same there is a tendency in British polling to underestimate Tory voters.

However - re: Trump and American polling - his victory was well within a normal polling error. American polls are still often pretty accurate. IMO the problem with Trump and polls was how the media interprets polling. Synopsis: The EPA administrator’s corruption eruption continues. Fox News once again tells a black celebrity to shut up. Florida faces climate change and climate change deniers. Teachers rebel against budget cuts. Trump attacks vulnerable asylum seekers. And the movie Blockers isn’t about sports after all. Live from Miami, Jon is joined by Akilah Hughes, Alicia Menendez and Natasha del Toro to break down the week’s news. Oh and there’s some light Rubio criticism, obviously. What a week.

Also Akilah and Lovett ran into Cardi B &amp; I'm not good enough at making up puns. https://twitter.com/jonlovett/status/982485015157231616Are they recording via a mic on stage to pick up everyone? Because there is a lot of echo that honestly shouldn’t really be there for such a successful podcast. It sounds pretty bad and all they’d need to do is take their audio directly from the desk and set up another mic for audience noise if they want. Honestly I enjoy the live pods way more when Dan is there. He somehow grounds it a bit and it feels less pep-relly ish. Synopsis: Parts of the unreleased Miami show with Pod Save America. The only way in hell I'd listen to a podcast I'd hate so much was if I was being paid or doing research on it. I just don't have the time to hate-listen to things a few hours every week! 

If its the former, great gig, if the latter you'd think you'd be less likely to completely just blatantly be misleading about what was said. 
That's a reasonable and fair interpretation of everything that has been said in your mind, I'm sure. 

Just a suggestion though, stop hatelistening, it'll be better for your blood pressure. I'm glad Tommy talked about Syria. It is a tough issue with tough choices (let Assad crush his people, or keep fighting an unwinnable proxy war versus Russia) in which either one causes thousands of civilian deaths. Tommy is totally right that he nor the experts have the answer, and that Trump will not make an educated decision on the matter.


But I personally believe that the US cannot change Syria through militaristic means. The best thing the US can do is to impose sanctions and take in hundreds of thousands of refugees. We need to lead by example as a country and show that the US is a safe haven from tyrants and dictators whether they be in the Middle East, Africa, Central/South America. If we took in those people, I think that would be a first step in changing the imperialistic military culture in the US. Thanks for the podcast recommendation! I will check it outIt's weird though. I get along with my co-workers and almost anyone I know. Most people think I'm a friendly guy, but it doesn't seem to make me happy. Maybe I'm just wired differently than most people and that is why I always get depressed. But honestly being a loving guy only goes so far with my personal well beingBut it's scary, you know... I have to rely on millions of people I don't know on being informed and engaged. If we honestly can't take back the house and Senate in Trump's America then I think we are truly lost as a country. I can't live in a place that will systematically discriminate against my family members because they are transgender.Synopsis: Trump tries Twitter diplomacy with China and Syria, and Florida Democrats have a chance to help flip Congress. Then Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy (D-FL) joins Jon, Jon, Tommy, Dan, and Alyssa on stage in Orlando to talk about gun control, immigration, and the 2018 midterms.

She was Deputy Chief of Staff under Obama. So... you know. She's been in politics for a while and has valuable insights.

Also she's funny and wonderful.538 is a very neutral numbers-based podcast. They talk about news stuff but are at their best when crunching numbers and analyzing races.Yes, because uptalk serves a linguistic purpose and if you just so happen to hate things associated with women's voices its worth considering the WHY. 

Favreau and Lovett sometimes use uptalk as well. I haven't seen anyone describe them as "grating"There's a lot of interesting discussion about how uptalk facilitates conversation and creates a dynamic wherein active listening is encouraged. I'm not calling you a misogynist bc that isn't really my point here but I think that its worth examining - for literally every person - why we hate uptalk or vocal fry or things that just so happen to be associated with women. Maybe it really is an innocent thing on your end, I don't really know or know you but its worth discussing how in broader contexts our culture tends towards dismissing how women talk. Synopsis: DeRay, Brittany, Sam and Clint are live from National Geographic HQ in Washington, D.C. to discuss race and science, MLK, Maya Angelou, and the news, and DeRay has a conversation about black holes, women in STEM and race and genetics with Nat Geo explorers Jedidah Isler and Keolu Fox.

The audience really bothered me this episode. I just wish they’d go back to the studio more. There was a PPP poll that had Cruz up only 45-37. However it was a poll done on behalf of End Citizens United, for whatever you make of that.

There was also a Texas Lyceum poll exactly one year ago that had them tied at 30%, which is one of the earliest indicators for people that there could be an opening.1) He's young, charismatic and traditionally handsome so that always gets press coverage. Ted Cruz is the political equivalent of eye gunk in the morning. 

TX might one day become purple and the only way to really tell is to run competitive candidates in every election we can. Even if Beto loses, getting registered voters and getting people excited for "next time" in TX is a worthy goal. Beto's getting name recognition he might not have had before the primary-win now, he's getting more free media. 
 
At the very least, the RNC/NRSC is going to have to invest a lot more money in a race that traditionally would be seen as "safe" for them and hopefully that means they'll use less money in other races. Trump won Texas by nine points, which is about the same as his margin in Ohio and Iowa, and I get the sense that a lot of Democratic strategists are planning on playing to the 2016 map. Trump is about as unpopular in Texas as he is nationally, so when combined with Ted Cruz being a weak candidate and O'Rourke being a strong one, I can see why they want to make the push.

Also, given that ted Cruz was arguably the leader of the Senate tea party candidates I am sure there is a certain personal element.Synopsis: The Simpsons uses Lisa Simpson as a mouthpiece to defend racism. Jimmy Kimmel and Chelsea Handler come under fire for using homophobic jokes to attack conservatives. Cardi B makes America great. Kay Cannon, director of 'Blockers,' joins Ira, Kara, and Louis to discuss John Hughes films and raunchy teen comedies. Plus, Ira shocks Kara and Louis by professing his love for wrestling.Synopsis: A conversation between Crooked Contributor Erin Ryan and Dr. Caroline Weinberg about organizing the March for Science and what the threats to science actually are. 

It should help him. Incumbency, especially of a high-profile person like Paul Ryan, is a big advantage, and Ryan has a massive warchest. Open seats are much more likely to flip than seats with incumbents.Synopsis: Tommy talks with former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright about the rise of fascism around the world and her concerns about how it is being enabled (and emulated) by Donald Trump. Then they talk about how Trump should respond in Syria, and Albright’s visit to North Korea in 2000 for meetings with Kim Jong-Il.

I’m confused, are these livestreams part of the regular PSA episodes or a separate thing?Weird how they don’t mention it all on the podcasts, I discovered their video/live content just by chanceIt's usually a spur of the moment kind of thing when big news breaks and they'll announce it on twitter about an hour beforehand. So there's no set schedule. It just happens when it happens.Me too!

Like I know she moved to LA and has a new job and I'm sure is very busy, but what about what I want, Erin??? What about MY needs?

waaaahhhI thought this was a really solid episode. A lot of thoughtful insights. I might not 100% agree with everything Secretary Albright said, but she had some great perspectives.

Also, my favorite ad reads are the ones where Tommy is obviously uncomfortable. lol. So the Tommy John's ad was very amusing.Yellow and Orange are the best and I don't care if it costs me my sponsors!Serious, serious question: are sanctions considered imperialistic? I've never had the impression that anyone considered them to be signs of imperialism.**Synopsis**: Speaker of the House/Dan’s Favorite Politician Paul Ryan announces his retirement, Donald Trump has a televised meltdown over Mueller, and the Republican media goes all in on a conspiracy to obstruct justice. Then Stoneman Douglas students Delaney Tarr and Diego Pfeiffer talk to Dan and Tommy about the next steps in their efforts to prevent gun violence. 

The interview with the Parkland kids was great. Those kids are so damn smart and determined to make a change. I feel so inspired listenging to them.That's not true at all, in fact Bill rails against people who believe that shit. He always argues with Cornel West and his support for Jill Stein and he shat on Colin Kaepernick for saying that Trump and Hillary were equally bad. Just because he criticizes the Dems for being too weak doesn't mean he feels they'rejust as bad as the Republicans.Pretty sure it was tongue-in-cheek, and not meant to be totally serious. I laughed out loud when Jon said "Charlene..." with such a disappointed tone.Erin Gloria Ryan is so consistently funny. I need her podcast like yesterday.She was on With Friends Like These this week and mentioned that the pod was indevelopment.I think that the strikes are going to be ultimately ineffective so like... it's all just for show, really. Assad is still going to be using other weapons to attack his own people so.... hooray for a pointless display of military force??

Unfortunately, I don't have a solution to Syria. I don't know what we could do to help the situation there without killing civilians and creating a power vacuum and political instability for decades to come.Not the biggest fan of the panel aside from Erin, also I wish they posted pictures of the stuff they’re talking about in the show notes. If the strongest response you have to a point is to throw about McCarthy style accusations, it might be worth reflecting on whether you are on the right side of the argument. Are you okay with the Saudi campaign against Yemen? The ethnic cleansing of Rohingya in Myanmar? Or the famines in South Sudan, Somalia, and Nigeria (which are less exciting because the solution wouldn't be big exciting explosions)? I am just curious why, of all the crises in the world, the one to get involved in is the one with the greatest risk of igniting a great power conflict?

Beyond that, what in the long history of US intervention in the Middle East has convinced you that it would actually make things better.The Keep It! crew likes to poke Jon Lovett for being bad at pop culture. For instance, Lovett took a selfie recently with Cardi B and had no idea who she was, so the Keep It! people gave him a hard time for that. "To the gulag with him!"Erin Ryan’s “I think we all tried to ‘Secret’ the pee tape” joke was incredible and didn’t get enough love imo lolthe fuck is a Chapo?...Nothing that is truly horrible about Trump, not the horrific nature of immigration enforcement or the casual cruelty of federal social services administration or blatant corruption or the unchecked nature of military operations, is unique to him or unprecedented. Progressives should write and speak about Trump, but also with an eye towards the system that produced him. A good example of this is [this article](https://www.thenation.com/article/how-progressives-should-think-about-russia/) in The Nation about how The Russia Stuff is actually about oligarchy.I wish they would use a Crooked Conversations to talk a bit about things like the drone campaigns, NSA spying and mass deportations. They don't need to denounce Obama or whatever, but at least give an insider perspective on these things so we can understand how to avoid them in the future. If the result of the political energy bubbling up right now is a reversion to the pre-2017 political order it will be the biggest failure of the progressive movement since the 1970s.LOVE this concept.

I hope there are a lot of good conversations that flow from this pod, and I want to leave a voicemail. Need to figure out my thoughts first though.Super curious how this will end up. There is a very long history of leftist critiques of the Democratic Party, and I really hope he engages with them--starting with Henry Wallace.

&gt;Democrats didn’t even attempt to do an autopsy in the wake of 2016

This is something that has been really bugging me. After the primaries, progressives were told that now was the time for unity, we needed to rally around Clinton, and fair enough (this was something I strongly argued for). After the election, we were told that now is not the time to relitigate the primaries, we need to unify in opposition to Trump. Then it wasn't the time to criticize the ACA because we needed to protect it. Then it wasn't the time because of the special elections--I remember on PSA they said it wasn't the time to criticize Northum for reaching for the dogwhistle, because we needed to beat Gillespie. Now, I assume, it isn't the time because of the midterms. You see where I am going with this.

So godspeed, Favs.I really appreciate the amount of contempt the PSA guys hold Comey in.More pods! More pods! More pods!Maybe her white parents were living in Hawaii when they were pregnant with her and wanted to reclaim the word *haole* but never saw it written and thought it was *howlie*? Similar story with their second child Gringough. 

But in all seriousness, congrats to them. Dan is going to make such a great dad. I can't wait to hear all about baby Pfief on PSA!Erin’s dad looks good &gt; Once you get away from the idealogically purified ideas that Chapo people educate others about, you realize the only conversation that matters is in the Middle

Is this satire&gt; If we want to help Syria, we should open our doors to a lot of refugees. Taking sides in a complicated mess of a civil war only hurts the Syrian people.

I'm pretty sure that's something that 99+% of PSA listeners and the PSA hosts agree on. I think the problem is that a pro-refugee policy (I can't believe there's any other kind of policy) won't happen until 2020 and that's if we win, so it's hard to discuss it further as there won't be new developments for a while. They did touch on the lack of refugee help from this administration, though; they didn't ignore it altogether.I'm a bit confused. Is your concern that they did the order of this podcast wrong? This was one of my favorite PSA episodes in a while. I think they have a great take on Comey and really dug into why he is disliked by both sides and why this book tour is bullshit. The Syria part was pretty good, and I agree that no president should be the autocrat on foreign policy. Congress talks a big game on war &amp; retribution, but do not want to be responsible for it's repercussions. I hoped they would go more into Lybia, but the crew struggles with criticising Obama. The interview was really good, especially where he was super pragmatic about what he thinks will happen with Trump.  100%! I absolutely hate that the liberal media (NTY, WaPo, MSNBC, etc.) keep on bringing out and hiring "never-Trump" conservatives. It's such a typical old-school media way of thinking. Trying to appeal to the centrists/Republicans is dumb because about 50% of the Democratic party favor socialists/democratic-socialism and GenZ are Democrats by a 2:1 margin (possibly more). Even if we temporarily ignore the moral argument, the demographics are against the conservatives. I called the number for the new podcast ( (949)667-4524 ) and left a message taking about the voices in the podcast. I said that about half of Young Democrats consider themselves socialists/dem-socs, which means that they are tired if centrist pundits being interviewed. We need more leftist voices (Communist, Socialist, people from Socialist countries) to speak on the POD. They have a different perspective and could lead to new ideas that could possibly engaged those leftists voters. There best


Fresh voices. Fresh ideas. Fresh perspectives.Relevance to this sub???Favreau is starting a new podcast about the Democratic Party. He set up a hotline you can call and leave a message related to the question “what’s wrong with the Democratic Party and how can we fix it?”I know this isn't the main part of your post, but just to clarify, Pod Save America isn't really moderate. All four hosts are pretty solidly in the center of the Democratic Party bell curve. But over 3/5 of the Democrats in the House and over a third of the Democratic caucus in the Senate, including every senator that we're expecting to run in 2020, endorses Medicare for All. In addition, many Democrats running in 2018, including high-profile campaigns like Beto O'Rourke and Kevin de Leon, are endorsing Medicare for All in their platforms. So I don't know why this meme is spreading false information.So I'm just going off of issues of the day:

* They are pro-Medicare for All
* They support sweeping gun safety measures
* They support higher taxes on the rich
* They are in support of financial reform in the vein of what Sen. Warren wants and had her as a guest multiple times
* They are in support of women's rights and reproductive rights, and have been very vocally supportive of the #MeToo movement to the point that many people on this subreddit think they're focusing on it too much
* They are in support of LGBT rights, including trans rights (which many Dems still need nudging on)
* They want more action on climate change and were very passionately against leaving the Paris Agreement (although they haven't spoken on this too much admittedly)
* They are vocally pro-union in all fields of work (again, they don't talk about this as much as they should)
* They speak often about police brutality and BLM and have included many speakers from the movement on their programs (see: DeRay, Brittney Packnett). This in particular is something that many Democrats still refuse to accept and promote.
* They support and have donated to pro-refugee and pro-immigrant causes and have been VERY outspoken in their support for DACA, anti-ICE, and anti-travel bans.

I mean, is there a progressive idea that a person like Gillibrand or Harris or Schatz or Brown supports, but PSA doesn't? I think you can totally argue that the Democratic Party itself is too far to the right or that its bell curve isn't left enough, but as what it is right now, they are squarely in line with the Democratic Party's general median.I'm in agreement with your last sentence :) I think the gap in policy between 'moderates' and 'leftists' in the party is way overestimated, personally. I do think the median of the party needs to move to the left, and that's what I'm working toward because it'd be better. [It looks like it's on the way as well](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/politics/house-primaries-candidates/?utm_term=.dc3b4d00797c)That's totally true and I get that, but that's not the question. The question was 'are the hosts in the middle of the Democratic Party' and they are. They're not Manchin/Heitkamp/Lipinski.Synopsis: Pod Save America co-host Jon Favreau talks to Andy Slavitt, the board chairman of the United States of Care, and Adam Gaffney, an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School and secretary of the advocacy organization Physicians for a National Health Program about what it will take to get medicare for all and what factors need to be considered to get to single payer.​I wasn't particularly impressed with Andy's defense of USoC. He didn't address the criticism directly nor did he give skeptics any reason to believe that the organization is working all-out for single-payer.

The reason this became such a huge deal on the Left is that disentangling healthcare quality from the profit-motive is the only way we'll prevent a tiered healthcare system from forming.This is a really good listen for people who like the idea of single payer but want to understand more about how it would work and what it would look like. Adam did a great job of explaining single payer, imo!Cannot wait!!!&gt; I think most mulit-payer supporters simply do not care which system we get, while single payer advocates basically call multi-payer system supporters/sympathizers traitors.

In my experience, very few people actually argue positively for German style multipayer systems (for good reason, I don't see much evidence that it is cheaper or more effective). I do see plenty of people who are opposed to progressive policy (perhaps characterizing advocates as "stubborn children") bring up multipayer as a way to derail conversations on single payer.

There are some policy details that will need to be worked out eventually. There are others, like cost, that really don't. But a phrase like "Medicare for All" is simple and easily understandable and there is no good reason not to use it.The USoC is one of those things (like the vote for the recent bank bill) that is so transparent that you really need to talk yourself into believing it isn't what it obviously is.

Matt Yglesias at Vox said something to the effect that insurance and pharmaceutical companies need to realize that if they don't put their political muscle towards healthcare reform, the next step is the pitchforks. I suppose it nice that this realization is shared by some segments of the industry, although I am not opposed to pitchforks when it comes down to it.Fine. What reason do you have to prefer those over single payer?If there is one thing that I really hope we learn from the Obama years, it is that compromising before the negotiations start is bad politics.

As for the other points, where is the evidence of that? You can't point to any sort of consistently lower costs or better care in multipayer systems, and I would suggest that is because "innovation" in this regards is largely meaningless--particularly in this regard, where "private sector innovation" is about maximizing profitability.

Given that the actual negotiations that occur in healthcare are not between people and insurance providers but between insurance providers and hospitals/pharmaceutical companies/etc a monopoly is good.Chris Hardwick I love how Jeff "part of the resistance" Flake voted yes on a climate change denier to run NASA. An organization that conducts weather research around the globe and has extensive research into climatology especially ocean climates. What a piece of garbage, no redeemable qualities. He was wearing a PSA t shirt in a recent photo, think it might’ve been on his Instagram story I said that I wanted more leftist voices. Too many corporate/moderate liberals get a platform, but they aren't the ones who are pushing us forward. If I wanted centrist rhetoric I would watch MSNBC. Crooked Media has a real platform to give to those who need it, not Joe Biden.I haven’t called  yet. But I do want to. I think I want to talk about how the Dem party is the real big tent party and while that can be good because we can have policies that appeal to people who care about different things (reproductive rights, racial justice, climate change, health care advocates, income inequality, organized labor and LGBT rights, to name a few)... it can also be hard to adequately address all those issues. And it’s hard to coalesce all those issues into a single catchy slogan for purposes of campaigning. 

I think one of the solutions to fix the party is to worry less about compromising with the GOP and instead work on compromises within the party so we can be better unified and feel more represented by the party instead of just being here because it’s the only viable option for anyone left of Crazy Town. Tommy laid out the facts as we understand them.

Kelly agreed with the Trump administration in every way on Syria strikes.

Tommy brings up criticism from the old Bush officials that think the US should be shooting down helicopters and killing Syrian soldiers.

Kelly says that case could certainly be made.

Tommy asks what our 2,000 troops are actually doing in Syria.

Neither Kelly nor Tommy knows.

Tommy asks if we should withdraw from Syria.

Kelly says American presence is vital, even if we have no mission.

Foreign policy in the Democratic party is so broken.The problem isn't her vote for Pompeo, but it is about milquetoast Democrats conceeding every cabinet pick, every spending bill, every deregulation law, etc. 



Who does she think is voting for her? Do you think the liberals in ND will be inspired to come out and vote for her? I wouldn't.



Same shit with Doug Jones! He voters with Trump all the time and never has a spine. HE WON BECAUSE OF THE BLACK VOTE, LOST THE WHITE VOTE. How does he repay them? But"appealing" to those white voters who voted for ROY MORE. He had seemingly turned his back in his voter base to appeal to the 'moderate'. Does he think he will get my donation again when he runs in 2020?



I get it though... A Democrat is better than a Republican in almost every single way. But, these"bi-partisan" senators are the reason the young liberal voters don't show up! Young people are inspired by those who have conviction, by those who fight, by those who will throw away their seat to do the right thing. Again, these young people need to show up and make their voices heard if we want to stop re GOP from hijacking this country. But, the current senators are doing nothing to help them to the polls.So hold up, one Democratic senator out of 49 says she’ll vote for Pompeo and everyone says that the Democrats aren’t fighting this? That makes no sense, by that logic republicans opposed DeVos. Amazing interview. I was genuinely tearing up at the end of the podcast.Of course it's slanted. I was mocking the sentiment and trying to underline the lack of a left-wing foreign policy infrastructure.

I am a member of the Democratic Party; I have Friend of the Pod sticker on laptop; I've listened to the guys since Playing Politics; I also occasionally listen to Chapo and post on /r/CTH.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Incredible botThere's a difference between being an atheist and an Internet Atheist, and those who hung out in Internet Atheist areas online were kinda ripe for the picking for the far right white nationalist movements.I still to this day contend that Chuck Schumer did not have a plan and really screwed up the shutdown. He had a real chance of showing the strength of the Democrats, but media pressure was enough to get him to cave.

The weed bill is nice, but it is isn't enough to instill confidence in him as a Senate majority leader. I hope when we take back the Senate in either 2018/2020 we will put in a new majority leader.'Senate Majority Leader Elizabeth Warren' is on my Christmas list.I think Warren would struggle as a president. She doesn't have a populace image that Harris and Gillibrand have. She is a great senator and is the most financial literate person in Congress. If we get a Democrat president I would want her to be a possible Senate majority leader or the financial section leader.

But I think she isn't the most charismatic, and that is a vitally important trait to becoming an effective president. She is a pragmatic individual and is great at making legislation and enforcing financial crimes.It’d be cool if they did this sort of thing for PSA live shows - as in, having a specific topic that isn’t tied specifically to what’s going on right now. I much prefer hearing the guys talk about the news of the week in the studio setting rather than the live setting, but wouldn’t mind live eps if it’s this format. Oh my god, the audience in this one... when Joanne is making a very serious and important point about liberals being aware and cautious that they also fall into a trap of believing salacious rumours and potentially false stories to further their beliefs, basically being guilty on some level of what the Right do constantly, she mentions “we have to be aware of this when Trump is gone and when there is another Democratic presid”- WOOOOHHHHHHH YEAHH DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT!!

Instantly the audience hollers and whoops at the mention of ‘Democrat and president’ in the same sentence. I swear whenever anyone on this show or PSA live goes even near being critical of the left, everything goes deathly silent and then the next time someone mentions anything mildly supportive of the left they go insane, as if balance is restored or something. I don’t know what it is but I have to imagine Lovett is aware of how irritating these tendencies that the live audiences have are. It’s meant to be a discussion, not a pep rally. No I think he definitely did do a good job of steering it away from a pep rally vibe too much and encouraging honest and critical discussion, so props to him for that. I disagree. Democratic Underground was the most mainstream site for Democrats back then and you were (gently) ostracized if you didn't at least believe that Bush or someone else in the administration let 9/11 happen on purpose. Hell, a Democratic councilwoman in my city made national headlines just this month for questioning 9/11 in a post on Facebook.Eh I prefer how they usually do it more. I get the difficulty of trying to podcast in an environment with breaking news every 4 hours, but it still makes feel more relevant than a general topic imo.I thought this was one of her better episodes. Very respectful, just something that left me feeling smarter and more enlightened after listening to it.I was only referring to discussions online and not in the "real world". It was much rarer to meet someone in person that was an open 9/11 conspiracy theorist than it was online. I think the only person I remember being a 9/11 conspiracy theorist that I actually knew in person belonged to a cult and believed all kinds of insane things.

EDIT: Just checked Loose Change's Wikipedia page and apparently it generated over 4 million views in 4 months back in 2006 which was a huge number back then.Weird watching the live stream of recording this on youtube and seeing all the mistakes that would be edited out when they upload it in audio. Just grammar stuff mostly but still. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaHmNzL-9xMIn studio shows &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; live showsTeam Lovett because you can always put on a sweater if you get chilly, but if I get to warm, I shall just lay down on the floor and wait for death to claim me.PSA are the best in the business at ad reads. It's the only podcast where I actively listen to the ads.Lovett is a great one on one interviewer. Always enjoy his interviews and though it wasn’t apparent in one because it wasn’t the context for it, he’s been great whenever politicians have been on for not letting them get away with too much politician sounding talk, where the other guys might let it go. Keep It! Is the only pop culture podcast that I enjoy. Most of them feel like gossip magazines or just recap the latest reality show drama. 


Keep It! successfully ties in celebrity news with feminism, racism, culture issues, and current events. They gang does a great job at discussing pop culture in a larger context, which is so refreshing. For example, them talking about 'Celebrities who are problematic' did a great job at showing those who might be great actors/writers, but hurt their image by not being accountable to what they said or did in the past. 



Great episode!P U N D I T  I S  A N  A N G E L Pete Davidson said it best \- "If it doesn't have a sick beat behind it, we don't care about anything Kanye has to say." Pop Rocket also does this, usually.Kind of wish they just wouldn't talk about the Kanye tweets at all. I get that it's relevant and a big story, but it's just giving this nonsense more attention. He's promoting his album by stirring as much controversy as possible by whatever means necessary, that's all. Not worth making a part of the podcast imo. Yeah, though I do believe that he believes a lot of the stuff he's saying, I think it's mostly just to make himself as deeply rooted in public conversation and interest as possible by whatever means even if it alienates and turns off most of the fans who've supported him to this point. He's turned off fans in the past so I think this is that but just on a bigger scale. Jesus Christ... That Fox and Friends interview was rough. I cannot believe his staffers let him do it.Eh, the conversation they had was pretty good, and wasn't really about Kanye at all.A real problem is that all "clicks" are equal, whether you are just wanting to read the sub header or whatever wHaCkY tweet is posted or reading a 1200 word article is the same to those metrics. Yeah, honesty I just saw in the description and from Favs’ tweets about the new episode that Kanye was among the biggest things they would talk about in this one. I guess I should’ve listened through before making my comment as clearly they made more of a joke about it than treating it like an actual topic, but I think it was fair to presume they would talk for real about it based on those tweets and the description. Really good podcast. The CIA have always had shady tactics and methods, but there been no accountability by anyone. I think the guest did a good job at critiquing Obama and why his "move forward" campaign allowed the CIA to continue a culture of abuse. 


Hopefully our next president will actually kick out those who advocated for torture and prosecute those who allowed it to happen. I think Gillibrand or Bernie would be the most likely to actually fix the CIA. Biden or Harris would probably ignore the problem based on their historical law enforcement record.FINALLY. Tommy is still an oddly reactionary weirdo sometimes. But this is the best episode they've had since Greenwald. And they actually address the big problems with the Obama legacy on torture as well. If you default on a Payday loan, you are fucked and it will take years to pay it off. While these PO banks will not rob you if you happen to default, which in turn allows them to pay it off affordably. 



Payday companies do not have the capital reserve to afford a bunch of defaults, thusly they must have predatory interest rates to make any profit. A post office will have tons of capital and can afford a few defaults. Because of these situations, Payday companies actively destroy the finances of poor communities while the PO banks will allow communities to grow and access money that normally isn't there. Business models that rely on predatory behavior should not exist (Payday loans, Multi-Level Marketing, etc.)Been looking forward to this and especially the OK Stop since I heard about the Trump rant for the ages on Fox and Friends. The thing is, it doesn't matter if the default rate stays the same, the post office will be fine. They have virtually unlimited amounts of money because they are backed by the federal government. Also, because more money is being moved into low-income areas, there will be greater economic activity. That growth will allow even more small loans and businesses to thrive in these communities. Economists predict that this bill will have post offices generating 9 billion dollars a year!Am I not liberal enough to be a friend of the pod if my immediate reaction to someone using the phrase "mansplain" is an eye-roll?

And no, I'm not a fan of Maher at all. Actually dislike him quite a bit.What a well thought out, constructive argument! /sOh my bad, I forgot redditors take everything extremely literally. Too bad her dad sucks 😔“I don’t know about other politicians, but I think if we work together we can help Washington cut across some of the nonsense and get to work! Because I believe in this country” 

Barf, next. Stop stroking yourself on the air. This ideas has been in play in Germany for dozens of years. Why Americans don’t want to look abroad to find answers for problems at home is so infuriating to me. Imagine thinking that the problem with the 2016 political coverage is that Trump's indecency wasn't called out enough.I'm not a big fan of CNN's centrist bullshit, but I think Jake Tapper is one of the better hosts there. In the early days he would actually go after Kellyane and challenge her alternative facts. But I still think that he is wrong in his belief that Trump is the reason CNN is called 'fake news'. CNN has 24 hours to display hard hitting journalism, but they spend 23 hours of pundits interpreting the news. And those panels were filled with conservative nuts who get a platform to whine about liberals, and also the liberals on there are practically GOP-lite. 



When was the last time a Socialist/leftist voice was given a platform to speak? Has CNN covered the murdering of nonviolent Palestine protesters? Have they covered the proxy war in Yemen? Or are they going to have a four person panel bitching about Michelle Wolf?DeRay and Gillibrand are the best! Congrats to Pod Save the People on the award! 100% deserved Watching election coverage on CNN is especially bad.I wish they would give deeper in topics with candidates and see how far left their views are. Trump obviously is criticizing news networks (like CNN) for bad and dishonest reasons, but these criticisms work because these same organizations are actually terrible. The absolute worst response possible to Trump's rise is to reflexively defend any groups he criticizes (the FBI, for example).Yeah, the casual mention that Hoover was taking care of the commies at State really rubbed me the wrong way. Likewise his statement that in the 1950s, when political parties were outlawed and the ACLU refused to defend accused communists, "our institutions" were more secure. I mean, maybe, but what does that say about our institutions?ITT: People commenting on Wolf's set when they haven't seen it.

Watch it. It's 20 minutes. It's really funny. There's a shot of Kellyanne Conway looking upset. It's worth your time.Bush pressured the intelligence agencies to provide a justification to invade a sovereign nation, that is incomparably worse than anything Trump has done in terms of human misery or the functioning of democracy.I'm glad someone else finally brought that up. When I heard that joke, I thought it was the striking similarity between the character of Aunt Lydia and SHS. Especially since, even though it's a current and very popular show, it's the sort of reference that not everyone immediately got. If she was trying to make a fat joke, I think she would have chose a more well-known character. Erin, don't make me wait any longer for your own pod!https://media.giphy.com/media/NvgkEvycaWhPi/giphy.gifIt will be really easy though: Trump won key states in the rust belt by miniscule margins. Actually talking aboit issues and investing time and money in those states means an easy win. What I find the most interesting about 2016 was that it was a massive failure by everyone.


Hillary:

-Never did a good job explaining her email situation

-Was very un-charasmatic when speaking/explaining her policy positions

-Was too comfortable with the polls and avoided a lot of areas that flipped to Trump



Media: 

-Focused way too much on her emails/never covered issues that average people cared about

-Never called out Trump and his campaign staff on his dumb policy ideas in substantive ways (using pundits, not policy experts)

-Covered Trump's tweets of the day, but never his actual sexist/racist past (Parkland 5, kicking minorities out of condos, sexual assaults, etc.)

-Worthless debates



Population:

-Bought into the dumb strongman that Trump presented

-Deliberately avoided doing their own research on the candidates, while buying the media narrative

-Complacency or wanting to blow up the status quo



Everyone has a part to play in this election. The problem is that almost no introspection has happened after 2016. The media is still Shit, 35% of this country still believes in the strongman Trump, and politicians still believe that the populace likes the centrist compromising philosophy.   Sexism was very real during the campaign. For example, Matt Lauer (sexual assaulter) had separate interviews with Trump and Hillary. Was so kind and nice to Trump and fed him easy questions. Then he went after Hillary and tried to hit her with gotcha questions.


But the emails are a complicated issue. Overall, it's a non issue because most politicians have their own private emails, standard practice. But when the story came out she tried to avoid it, then downplayed them, then addressed it halfheartedly. But it never felt genuine, didn't feel honest, and therefore people assumed that any further response was going to be a lie. She should have really owned the emails, outright say that she screwed up and that she will be careful in the future.


She was held to a higher standard than Trump. But that is because she was a politician with a long history in government to criticise. Trump was an oaf who people thought was the wacky uncle who says stupid shit at the family gathering. Hilary was a bad candidate. The dems had incredibly low turnout. Especially in the rust beltAh see I'm half-and-half agreeing with you. All guests need to be comedians, full stop. A lot of times Lovett invites an activist or a journalist to be on the panel, and they're almost always duds. The guests should be politically minded, I agree, but they don't need to be encyclopedias about current events. Lauren Lapkus isn't super-political in her comedy but she killed it last year.I had to turn this one off after the woman confused Tommy Lee Jones with Tommy Lee and thought there was a Pamela Anderson/Tommy Lee Jones sextape floating around out there. The whole first 10-15 minutes before that was just cringe cringe cringe.What obvious reasons?Amen. She was not funny. Maybe try not resting you laurels on your skin color as much next time and do a little bit or research on current events and politics? Add Akilah Hughes, then add one comedian guest a show and you got a stew going.  I was there too.  I'm so curious about the white Wakanda thing.  I'm curious how he would have addressed the hill district.  At what point is a spoiler not a spoiler anymore?  Catch up if you care, people are going to talk about stuff. Ok, the thing that gets me is how many white women are blaming white men for all of this mess.  Guess what, white women voted for Trump too.  They are acting like they can divorce themselves from that fact while still blaming all white men, even those like us?  It makes no sense.  In my mind it was because the city is still kind of invisible but when you arrive it's pretty great. And it has lots of white people. &gt; I don't enjoy hearing how because I look a certain way that I need to shut up.

I mean...I say this all the time but as a pretty progressive/liberal dude I find it so hard to understand/rationalize the sheer amount of white self-loathing I keep hearing from people who share most of my worldview, including folks from Crooked Media. Its why I had to unsubscribe from Ana Marie's podcast...just some of the stuff they talk about was too much. I don't remember which episode it was exactly but she had on a guest that was sharing a story about how she was with a black church group or something and literally *started crying* out of guilt of being a white female and part of a cohort of people that voted for trump. It was bizarre, absolutely bizarre.

And I'm a brown guy, lol.&gt; Guess what, white women voted for Trump too.

The fuck does it matter? I'm south asian, I don't feel the need to apologize for the dumb shit that people in south asia do so why do white people feel the need to apologize/feel guilty for the dumb shit other white people do? Its a fucking martyr complex and it helps nobody.Glad I'm not the only one that thought this panel was awful. Lovett is a gem, the rest are...not so much. He can get better guests for sure.But that's kind of my point.  I don't feel guilty for shit I didn't do, but many white women are pointing the finger at white men.  Oh ok I guess I misunderstood you my bad Lovett does a great job at getting to the fundamental issue of this controversy. It's not just that they sent out spies on civilians. It's not just that they were attempting to extort those individuals in power. It's not even that they were trying to affect important US foreign policy. It is that those with power can do almost anything to get their way, but those of us who are poorer have almost no agency in government. The only way this situation can happen is if the rich are so wealthy that their influence outweighs the rest of us.

Rules for thee, not for me. That is the world we live in. The only way we change it isn't just jailing those who did this, but to change our fundamental political and wealth-equality structures.
Ross is incredibly fun to dunk on. He's wrong about just about everything in the world.

That being said, he's at least intellectually honest and consistent. I think most leftfolk would say he's better than the Bari Weisses and David Brookses and Bret Stephenses of NYT-verse.They don’t understand thy reddit is just a mirror for our society. Inevitably some of the people looking will be fascists. That doesn’t mean that r/babyelephantgifs and r/frugal, for example, need to be implicated. 

His example would have been easier on the ear had he used Voat as an example instead of Reddit. PSTP did make me reconsider "banning the box" - that by not asking whether someone has a criminal past on an employment application, it raises the risk of an employer just assuming the black applicant has a criminal past because they don't have an answer confirming otherwise.&gt; Hamas has exploited the situation. Israel, and by extension the US are making no effort to make things better, but the engagement of Hamas isnt either.

Hamas is "exploiting" the human rights disaster that is Gaza by leading protests against said disaster?&gt; The truth is, none of them would have gotten shot if they had stayed away from the fence, which Israel urged them to do several times. 

Alternatively, none of them would have been shot had Israeli soldiers not shot them. Borders Are More Important Than Actual Human Beings Tommy's foreign policy views are surprisingly right-of-centre. First with that joke of a Saudi Arabia pod (wherein his guest cited out-and-about teen's anger as justification for extralegal imprisonment of royal family members), and now with this slaughter in Palestine. If the same situation had unfolded in Bosnia or Rwanda or wherever, their denunciation of the perpetrator would have been absolute. But for some reason when it's the IDF slaughtering children, all they care to offer is "there's bad people on both sides, on both sides". Hypocrites on this front, the lot of them. Both parties are to blame but only one side suffered casualties? I want to complain but their name is literally 'Crooked Media'. I was under the belief that this was more ironic that true-to-form. 

Gee, why aren't the democrats appealing to their base? Could it be because Schumer and Pelosi are neck-deep in support of an Ethnostate that encircles a minority with walls twice the size of those at Auschwitz? Whose settlement policy is in clear violation of international law? 

No, no. It must be the Republicans. Let's just keep doing this.There is when convenient. Not in Bosnia, Guatemala, or Iran. But absolutely in Rwanda. Yup. Border walls work. That’s why we all support Trump wanting one, right?The people who want the wall would disagree Maybe they’re wrong if they think of Palestinians that way as well~All those 14 year olds who were murdered were Jihadists and Hamas, huh?Cool. I’m glad you’re ok with labeling all of them as terrorists and having a military force murder them because they could possibly be terrorists, maybe—I find that fucking horrific and I don’t know how somebody with your moral compass remembers to get out of bed every morning without massacring their entire family. Pausing halfway through to remind everyone that microtargeting is a really bad idea The cost of living varies across the country. So what? I agree. I was also happy to hear Ana Marie Cox make the same point on Left Right and Center on Friday. I guess I don't understand your point. Is it that in some places someone can scrape by with $15/hour? Can we not just assume some good faith on her part that she is advocating for a livable wage whatever that may be for a specific region?That’s the one, she was insufferable 

Lol getting downvoted for voicing the same opinions as the two above me. Never change reddit&gt; The problem is, getting Trump out of office does nothing.

Eh? Getting trump out of office isn’t *nothing*. It’s huge. Great episode! I think it did a really good job of explaining why things like Erik Prince's involvement and Rod Rosenstein's actions are very important, with enough humor to keep you from screaming. I think they also did a good job of pointing out that just because the collusion/corruption attempts are disjointed and jumbled doesn't mean that they're unimportant or that Trump et al. aren't culpable. Plus they made fun of Michael Cohen and the team and I'm always down for that.

I think it was good for Favs to mention that what ICE is doing isn't 'tough policing', they're doing things that are downright illegal and aren't justifiable to any sane person. Also Tommy pointing out that we *have* had a big crisis that we counted on Trump for -- Hurricane Maria -- and Trump completely dropped the ball, so we as a country no longer look to him as a leader. 

I think Shannon Watts is a really good interview too. The FBI doesn't just announce things they are investigating, especially of this sensitivity. If anything the fault is in talking about the email case and announcing it was reopened.I also recommend these other podcasts


Season Of The Bitch:
Feminist leftist podcast, stands up for Native American rights a lot


Citations Needed:
Podcast talking about problems with the media and how they portray our reality. Focuses a lot on foreign policy


Opening Arguments:
An interviewer and a lawyer explain current legal issues in a concise way that explains the process/legalese behind legal decisionsOA171 the one that talked about Wells Fargo was a really good episode, but a tough reality check on how much we are getting screwed by the banks. It's my second favorite episode behind the Stormy Daniels oneYeah. That's literally what I just said.You’re assuming that schools receive funds based on their race. In reality an interplay of many factors is what leads to underfunded schools, not the least of which is a bureaucracy ideologically repulsed by its very existence. 

Segregation is not institutionalized. It’s a choice people are making because they’re being backed into a corner by an archaic education system. The trick isn’t to just increase funding. This just abets current mismanagement. Nor is the answer affirmative action: when you give advantages to one race/ethnicity/gender, you are denying other oppressed communities their equal opportunity. 

I think voting should be mandatory. It would solve a lot of this bipartisanship by forcing politics to the middle. That way we’d have a reasonable Education Secretary that would create a plan that guarantees equality of opportunity and quality to every student, K-Bachelors. I assume in a couple hours.Wait, do people think the PSA hosts are being serious with this question? The hosts arent stupid, they know they’re not going to make news on a (popular) podcast when they could do it on the air or whatever. PSA are doing it because it’s fun to make people like Deval Patrick squirm. 

The biggest thing you could say about it is that it takes up like two or three minutes. Other than that, you’re making something silly into something serious.1) you’re right, the hosts shouldn’t be afraid to call out Obama administration failings when they see it. They touched on it on the last podcast but they could have gone farther. 

2) the ‘grilling’ against Favs right now seems overblown, and seems to be aided by a lot of bad faith actors (see: Caleb Hull and the IJR) who are trying to snipe at him for internet dunks and not being intellectually honestThat's true, I had not seen Faust's post and I think it needs to be discussed, too. Spending that much money is shocking and is way disproportionate to the issue. I just wanted to make sure that people knew one of the biggest 'He's an Obama shill' pushers on this works for a very pro-Trump outlet and doesn't actually care about these policies.

Also, I want to edit something I said up top: I said they 'could have gone farther' in criticizing, but I really should have said '*should* have gone farther'. I listened to it again, and I realize they're a live show and they need to cover different topics, but they don't have to be afraid of criticizing Obama policies. I think they are concerned we (the audience) won't like Obama criticism because we like Obama. We know he wasn't perfect, we can take it if he gets called out,; we should use the criticism as a push to be better progressives.Wait a minute, you're trying to say that Ziwe was getting critiqued because she was a non-white woman? Dude...Yeah but if a white male was "HAW HAWWING" on the mic nonstop and really not bringing much else to the table other than that I'd critique him too? I don't agree with your premise, and I'm a brown guy. Theres plenty of good examples of racial bias in our world, this isn't one of them.


Edit: I should say I'm really only referring to Ziwe right now, shes the one I distinctly remember acting insufferable on lovett's show
Maybe you’re just noticing a “pattern” where none exists because some of you seem hell bent to scream RAYCIS at every opportunity?...I’ve seen white men get criticized around here tooOh mercy me, I’m getting downvoted because I’m brown! I don’t *ever* see cis white men getting downvoted! all she did was just guffaw over the mic...i don't understand why critiquing that has anything to do with the color of her skin or her background...people who think the criticism is racially motivated need to take a fucking chill pill. as someone thats experienced ACTUAL racism(and does so nearly every day), this isn't fucking racistMaybe she was just hoarse all the time from speaking so much?oh so you enjoy it when guests contribute nothing other than yelling "HAHAAAAAAAA" over the other panelists every few secondsnotice how its okay for her to say all that stuff when prefaced with "im a 'woc'", if anyone else did they'd be downvoted to shit. The point they made about the outrage is going to be important. We'll have to pierce through that to talk issues, and I think one way to do that is to *take advantage* of the culture war to immediately pivot to more important talking points. 

Here's a few examples:

* "I think ABC did the right thing by terminating the show, because that kind of rhetoric, even though it's a free country and she's free to say it, is incredibly divisive in a time when America really needs to be coming together. We need to be coming together because we have crumbling infrastructure, rising health insurance premiums, decades of stagnant wages, and corruption raging in Washington. These kinds of divisive things, while dramatic and flashy, keep us from addressing those problems.

* XYZ thing that Trump did was totally inappropriate, and is not what a leader and a role model should be doing. What this country needs is a government that can fight hard to improve the everyday lives of Americans, not offer them childish reality TV dramatics. I'm talking things like medicare expansion, infrastructure rebuilding, bolstering our education system including raising teachers' wages, finding ways to work with other nations to reduce climate change and so on. If you want to address these things and make America stronger, more united, and more capable, I'll fight to get us there. If you want someone who makes excuses for Trump's latest tweet, vote for the other guy. 

I also think blatantly calling them out on the fear mongering and outrage tactics is going to be incredibly effective. I have no data to support this, but I feel like conservatives are particularly sensitive to hypocrisy, so to point out to them that they are the Party of Outrage Culture will be potent. However, we will have to immediately pivot to real issues so as not to get bogged down in their mud-slinging shitfest. You betta *werk* (on your administration's terrible policies of which you are complicit)!National Democrats from the top on down should have forcibly endorsed just one candidate in each district weeks ago and that includes Crooked Media. It would have pissed some Democrats off in California that are fans of the other candidates, but that's way better than actually losing the election on Tuesday.I know absolutely nothing about the individual candidates, but I would have gone with the one with the highest poll numbers across the board unless there was something seriously wrong with them. I wouldn’t care if it was a Sanders candidate or someone in the New Democrat Coalition.[Linda Sarsour is a victim of a very organized smear campaign by Israeli Intelligence firms](http://www.newsweek.com/israeli-intelligence-firm-spied-us-activist-linda-sarsour-sheldon-adelson-943435)Nope, his main point is that Democratic politicians who support equality will never achieve it through just social means. We must achieve it through economics as well. This means that you cannot be 'corporate friendly' Dem and still say that you champion social justice. We don't need Cuomo, Schumer, Feinstein... we need more of Bernie, Warren, Gillibrand, Schatz. His point is that we should primary any Democrat who pays lip service to equality but isn't fighting for it through economic means. This is what leftists understand, that the 1% would rather engage in social equality debates while they rape the US workers and steal all the profit. That is why passing gay marriage only works if LGBTQ people can achieve the same economic status of straight people. Even the Civil Rights Movement is struggling because it hasn't addressed the larger racial economic injustices present in the US.

To a larger point, if the Dems can propose legislation for economic equality and properly fund social security programs then they will attract those conservatives who only care about money and don't give a shit about social issues. This could lead to a liberal supermajority that hasn't happened in a century. The biggest factor in almost any election isn't corruption, abortion, guns, nepotism... It's the economy! Kim K really just mumbles the talk. Is that really true? Those are practically historical documents at this point.Ugh, I used to read the newsletter in its entirety for the first few weeks but lately I just started to ignore them, and I stopped reading the articles on the site (even though they're all really well written). 

I think I just lost my attention span for reading, which sucks :/

Edit: not to mention that I'm so plugged into the news cycle throughout the day (for now atleast, this might change once I start grad school) that I already know all the stories that are included in the email.This was such a great read. I should check out the site moreNice whataboutism! 

Obama was President during and after the financial crisis. He could have done more to jail those responsible. He didn’t. Ah okay, thanks! I’ll go listen again, it seems as though I’ve missed them. 

Good luck with your all nighter!!Great episode! It has got to be frustrating that black women are the most consistent voters of Democrats but they got no attention from Doug Jones, get shafted by Democrats voting for the Blue Lives Matter bill, and by the DNC/DCCC supporting mostly white men. I agree with DeRay, that the only way for blacks and other minorities to get representation in Congress is to take over the party leadership!There's something fun about going in person on the same day as millions of others. Most stations are pretty boring and bland, and it's kind of amusing to see the fate of the free world rest on these random  schools and libraries and fire stations.I make sure to look over my sample ballot ahead of time. Also I live in a Republican district so usually I don't have many choices to make.I meant Dem primaries usually have one person in each race, though this year we have governor plus TWO choices for house! I did not do the primary in 16 because there were no choices to make. Except nonpartisan mayoral race but my choice was almost guaranteed to advance, which she easily did.

I voted R for a few years until I had a major epiphany in 2015 and realized I was a progressive Democrat. But I could never pull the R ballot even to soften it out, I would just feel dirty. Besides it's not Deep South-level bad here.Square cash *is* the cash appI am in Michigan so you can vote in any primary you want. Don't need to register with one or the other. 

Downside of moderating the R's is that it makes them more likely to win in swing districts.Thanks! And it was trump himself.Ahhh I’ve been wanting Bryan and Erin on LOLI for soooo long and I’m so happy they’re finally here! I don't understand how referring to a show as a 'guilty pleasure' is mysoginistic...just because it happens to have a female star/lead? Really? Honestly, I have so much trouble reconciling the popular beliefs of a lot of folks on the left with my own worldview, this is just another example of it. Theres so many *legit* examples of sexist behavior in the world, why is this line of argument given any credence? In my view it just makes the *actual* instances of mysoginistic behavior easier to ignore by others.

I fully expect to get downvoted for this comment because apparently people on this subreddit cannot abide someone who isn't as liberal as them voicing an opinion.I've got plenty of "guilty pleasure" TV shows that don't have female leads, and there are a few shows with female leads that I enjoy and don't refer to as guilty pleasures. This just seems like a silly anecdotal thing to complain about(by the panelist).

&gt; women are taken less seriously then men on and off the screen.

How so? There are so many *amazing* female actresses that are downright revered. Why does it seem like you're ignoring these? 

&gt; It also suggests people are wayy less comfortable with watching shows led by women (and justify it by calling it a guilty pleasure).

But again, this just seems like conjecture to me. Your anecdote isn't any better than my anecdote, if that makes sense. 

&gt; This might not seem like a huge deal, but as a teenage girl who is given less repect and seen as less authoritative as my male counterparts

Sure I can understand that, and this is definitely a real issue, but I fail to see how it relates to my original point (guilty pleasure=/=mysoginistic)


edit: boom, downvoted already. i expected better from friends of the pod. oh well
I really wish they'd post links to the stuff in the show notesThe points about harping on the refusal of the DOJ to defend provisions of the ACA is absolutely key to the midterms. 

My own family is at serious risk if the pre-existing conditions requirement is dropped. I'm always very happy with the titling on these newsletters, but this one is, truly, some top shelf pun work.You just haven’t been exposed to the horrific glory that is Mawndoh! Ana Marie Cox is awesome when she delves into mental health. I’ve listened to some of the other podcasts about mental health (eg John Moe’s, Mental Health Happy Hour)—they can be good but are so focused on famous personalities that they miss the bulk of the things I want to hear about. 

I think a CM pod could help with recognizing that mental health is political—politics affects it through access etc issues and through its broader impact on our emotional landscape. Agreed! But hiring someone for their skin color is insane. They come to work every day knowing that they’re there as a quota filler? It’s belittling. And an insult to the whole staff if you a avoid hiring the best in favor of someone who requires on-the-job-training. When you reserve a seat for a black man or woman, you are taking the opportunity away from a gay latinx or bisexual asian, as well as other white people, to compete for the space. Low competition leads to poor results. 

I don’t think the solution is to reserve seats by race or ethnicity. The collateral damage isn’t negligible enough to warrant it - you’re just shifting the suffering one step to the left. 

There’s other ways of addressing systemic inequality and institutionalized oppression that don’t incite government failure and do benefit the long-marginalized. Rebuilding low-income, high crime rate neighborhood infrastructure, increasing school funding while making it easier to open charter schools, partnering public universities with low-achieving public schools in order to foster curiosity through workshops and hands-on experiences, the list goes on. 

Quotas? Wholly unreasonable. It’s literally discrimination. It’s why we don’t reserve seats in government to specific races or religions. 
As far as I understand the policy...

&gt; If posting about a news article or a political issue, please link or refer it back to a specific Crooked podcast or Crooked article. Recent(ish) is better considering the pace of the news, use your own judgement on this.

I'm asking because of a specific mention by Jon Favreau on the most recent episode of Pod Save America. Hard to get more relevant than that.

Appreciate the support, though. If you're wondering what /u/CinematicUniversity is talking about, [see this clip of Kamala Harris with Chris Hayes from earlier this spring](https://twitter.com/banditelli/status/972123325659889664).Sean's twitter name has been 'abolish ICE' and he still got hired and interviewed by Favreau et al. (not to mention they signal boost his tweets and articles often). If abolishing ICE was a no-go for Crooked Media, they wouldn't be as involved with Sean as they are now.I like her, but if Harris has aspirations for higher office, she needs the podcast more than the podcast needs her.  Also the hosts are for Medicare for All and they still get guests who aren't (or at least haven't said they are for it), so the hosts' political opinions aren't litmus test for who they have as guests.I don't think it's a no-go. But it's obviously not an identifiable policy for them yet.

They all seem to (*in some way*) advocate for Medicare-for-all. But there were already dozens of House Dems on board with M4A before Crooked Media ever weighed in. If they wanted to raise the flag for #AbolishICE, Crooked Media would be near the leading edge. No party officials have gone that far yet. Few candidates have.

I think it could be a pretty sizable turning point if they lined up alongside activists on this.&gt; No government branch is ever inherently good or inherently bad.

Gonna have to disagree here. I don't even know how you can hold this opinion with even an elementary understanding of American history.

If only the House Un-American Activities Committee had a good chairman!Two mattress companies. Casper and I forget the 2nd. Levitt then said he hated his old mattress which would’ve been the Casper. Searched for a post showing this but didn’t find it. It’s the signed bookplate they mailed out if you preordered Yes We (Still) Can and signed up for it on 12’s site. Thought it was really cool Dan put this together so everybody had the chance to get his signature vs. doing a few books signings. Nice! I’ve been reading Ben Rhodes’ book lately. 

Nice to support these guys. They have their heads on straight and are working hard."Du Pfff"

I would much rather have had Dan give commentary on his book than have a mini “debate” with Kelly.I honest to goodness don’t understand this article. None of these people have any connection to crooked media, I’ve never heard of any of them. The authors evidence of ‘voters are furious!’ is two tweets with very low fave counts. 

Primaries are good. If the voters still like the incumbent and think she’ll do a better job then they’ll vote for her. What’s the problem? Like seriously I read this article three times and the worst thing about the challenger is that he supports mandatory minimums. That’s a dumb policy position but if the voters hate it, they won’t vote for him. I understand your criticism, and I'd be inclined to agree, except for the fact that you and I would both be viewing the entire thing from our democratic/left perspective. 

I believe what I'm suggesting here would be particularly effective because it's exactly an attitude that they would employ to criticize liberals. In other words, it would be using their own cognitive dissonance against them. It would be directed back at them, and because they're so responsive and accustomed to thinking in that way, I believe it would cause them to become reflective. 

We've been trying the same strategy for decades of rational, reasonsed, moral-based arguments, and it's never worked. We need to adopt the rhetoric that conservatives use on each other, and that's what I'm suggesting here. 

If they want to fear monger, then we adopt the language they would use against each other. We have to speak their language, in order to defeat them. &gt; they would just respond by saying they want to prevent the situation from ever happening

So get them with the fork - "If you have all these guns and you're still scared, then what's the point of the guns? Either you have the guns and feel safer, or you're admitting guns don't do shit and you're still afraid of some immigrants." 

&gt;  their original arguments really aren’t that intellectually honest to begin with.

Of course they aren't intellectually honest. That's why intellectually honest arguments make no impact on them. We have to start speaking their language while still fighting for the intellectually honest outcomes. We can do this by using conservative language and tropes against them, like I'm suggesting here. 

Fair enough. Perhaps my points need some polishing, but don't you agree that the fear mongering is one of best ways the right wing activates their base? 

In terms of playing defense against that, we need to find a way to dull that blade. If rational argumentation isn't going to work, then what is? "So you're trying to tell me that when you bought your gun, you were thinking of defending yourself from someone crossing the border? Really? You live in Indiana. You're just letting the media scare you."

Again, my goal here is to undercut the fear mongering in general, not argue specific policy points. If we can undercut the fear mongering, it seriously weakens the emotional (non-rational) basis for much of Trump's policy support. &gt; The left needs to become the party of reason, facts, and demonstrable truth/integrity. We need to be able to show that facts aren't opinion, and why. They need to call out Republicans as liars and fear-mongers and not back down. And meanwhile they need to focus on issues that affect everyone, like the economy.

I don't see how calling out the fear-mongering and sticking to fact/integrity are mutually exclusive. I think they're complimentary. The facts actually support the idea that the fear mongering is bullshit. The problem is that the Trump supporters don't listen to the facts, so we need to present those facts/integrity in a way they're receptive to. 

We won't "convert" any of them, but if we can reduce the effectiveness of the fear, then that will go a long way. They probably would, and this goes back to their bad-faith argumentation. We *know* it's going to be one talking point after another, so we don't get baited. Just bring everything back to the fear and keep asking why they're always afraid and why Trump/GOP is always trying to scare them. Say, "Watch... I guarantee you that Trump will just try to scare everyone. All you'll hear from him is all the worst possible shit." Of course, this will inevitably happen, so your prediction will come true. 

If they can realize this, it undercuts their entire worldview. First, very interesting survey. Thanks for sharing this with me. I firmly believe this country needs to work on it's equality of opportunity. It would be great if the economic engine in this country were truly a meritocracy (with luck, of course) rather than what it is today. 

&gt; calling out the 'divide and conquer' methods that elites use to divide the working class


I do think that this is exactly what I'm talking about in my OP. Perhaps what I'm mentioning in my OP needs to be more of a passing statement, fit within the context of divide-and-conquer, rather than a central message.

Edit - Just saw this in the survey:

&gt; Second, calling out divide-and-conquer tactics is more effective when they are being used to
appeal to fears based on terrorism, but less so when being used to suggest there are people
expecting things to be handed to them. 

So yeah... I think my statement above is probably accurate. A statement like, "The Elites in the US try to make us fear one another with cherry-picked news reports, but that won't work this year. People all over this country - people of every race and sex - are getting the raw end of a deal where corrupt politicians and lobbyists look out for each other instead of making this country a fairer place with more opportunity for everyone."Forget where I first heard this but, “If one nazi is welcomed into a group of four people, they just became a group of five nazis.”That OK Stop was great. What a weird clip. I love Kara. I love Erin Gloria. The guys are nice to listen to as well. I listen to the late-week PSA and Lovett or Leave It while working in the garden on weekends. Fast forwarding with wet/muddy hands is a pain, especially when they have so many ad breaks.I know they try really hard to keep them entertaining, but I would still prefer to give Crooked cold hard cash over listening to them banter about not using those other apps anymore.I listen to loads of podcasts, and none of the others have as many breaks as the Crooked pods. Longer breaks perhaps, but not as many.Great work everyone! 

I hope Crooked media can be the start of a powerful left wing media outlet that rivals Fox, except minus the lies and manipulation. Note to everyone: the NYT website has a set number of pages you can view per month before you have to subscribe. If you go through incognito mode on your browser for these results pages, you can circumnavigate that. Very excited for Ocasio-Cortez! I really like her platform across the board, and in a district as blue as NY-14, there’s no excuse to not put forward the most progressive candidate. The Keep It team continues to bamboozle me with at least one dumb opinion every week, but their chemistry has gelled nicely. This is the only Crooked Media podcast that isn't by the original Keepin It 1600 team that I listen to every single week.I agree he should've said nothing because the language of this tweet feels like he felt like he had to say *something* about it. I don't think it's a blindspot though. Unless there's an egregious gulf between two Democrats running for the same position, I don't want Crooked Media to get too involved in primaries. Doesn't make sense for them from a financial standpoint either to alienate part of their audience. The focus should be on beating the Republicans first and foremost.I live in Charlotte and was crushed I wasn't able to go to this because I don't when they're going to be anywhere near here again.A lot of the complaints about this feel New York-based. If a socialist had won in an upset in New Mexico last night, do you think it would have gotten as much media attention as Ocasio-Cortez is getting today? Everything is so amplified if it’s happening in New York. Should we be expecting Crooked Media to be familiar with every Democratic primary across the country? Not trying to be argumentative, just curious if those are your expectations. Because that feels more of a job for Daily Kos than a company working on a macro level.On the plus side it looks like Blumenthal did an about-face after angry constituents melted his phone lines.
It would help and is definitely worth considering. The 9 person court is a norm, not a Constitutional  mandate. And we’re in the era of the destruction of norms. 

The 7-2 decision on Masterpiece Cake Shop was dictated as the Colorado court disrespecting their religion outside of the actual ruling* (that is not what happened, but let's move on). So, Trump's Travel ban while constitutionally legal should be nullified because the rhetoric justifying the ban was Islamaphobic and "Muslim Ban" was used by WH officials. Well what was the result?... The court ruled 5-4 IN FAVOR of the the ban citing constitutional legality. 


In every sense of the word, the SC ignored prior sentiment to enact partisan decisions. Me and the public are pissed because that ignored the whole point of the SC if the individual judges do not have a consistent view of the law. The fucking SC judges are acting like they are elected GOP shills and are ignoring the whole "separation of powers" aspect of our democracy.


And now it will be this way for the rest of my working life... I don't even know where to go from here guys"And the hill that I wanna die on is that *The Jetsons* features a world after a black genocide."

This premiere hit it out of the park."That's my detention center song..."

Jesus Christ that is goodHaven't listened to the podcast yet, but I think we're doomed regardless of what Murkowski and Collins do. There will be some combination of Manchin/Doug Jones/Heitkamp/Donnelly that will vote for Trump's nominee no matter how extreme.I don't think there's a chance in hell that Murkowski votes no. Susan Collins *may* vote no, but she'll be more than canceled out by the moderate Democratic senators up for reelection this year.I agree with you mate.Lord have mercy, I see you're on that lean this morning.Fighting in the midst of overwhelming odds is heroic though, so keep it up!You should also call Schumer and Gillibrand to reaffirm that you want them to fight any appointment tooth and nail, by any means necessary. None of the 'Well they'll get a hearing and we should let them show their merits' or whatever.
So you want to combat fascism by literally upending one of the 3 branches of government? 

EDIT: It's a non-starter regardless. Even if Democrats win the White House in 2020 and have two consecutive blue waves in the Senate, there still wouldn't be anywhere near the votes needed to do something like this. You'd only muster about 10-15 votes even if Democrats have 55-60 seats in 2021.No, what we don't like to talk about is our own mistakes in getting us to this point. While Mitch McConnell deserves to be known in the history books as one of America's greatest monsters, the fight elected Democrats put up in 2016 for Merrick Garland was pathetic. Obama and Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton talked about Garland for about 4 days and that was that. They all assumed Hillary would win, so it wasn't worth putting up much of a fight for Garland. They all took the easy way out and it cost them dearly. We also need to look at RBG (85 years old) and Stephen Breyer (79 years old) and ask why the hell they didn't retire sometime prior to 2015, especially RBG. We're all trying to cast spells on them to make sure they stay healthy, but all of that could have been avoided if they had just retired when Obama was president. We're just 1 85-year-old away from handing Trump *another* justice to make the Court 6-3 and an 85-year-old and 79-year-old away from making the goddamn Court SEVEN to TWO. 

(This turned into a stream of consciousness post and I do apologize for that. Still angry at fucking Kennedy.)Ocasio-Cortez retweeted [this video](https://twitter.com/PodSaveAmerica/status/1012743687296565250) from PSA's Twitter account, and also quote-retweeted it. 

I linked to Favreau's offer, but [here](https://twitter.com/Ocasio2018/status/1012817446493925377) is her reply.How do you mean “approach”?Well, The Improv is where LIOLI typically is when they aren’t on tour.Good to know–where did you buy your ticket?Did you see the HBO miniseries of it a few years ago? Pretty good, I thought.I love PSA, but they need to listen to their item advice sometimes. Why be hesitant if we take back control? Think of what Mitch has done and we should push back twice as hard.

-Pack the courts with 6 seats


-Remove filibuster


-Puerto Rico and DC get statehood


-Impeach all of Trump's judges he passed including the appeals court and any federal judge


-Prison reform/de-militarize the police


-Abolish/Prosecute Ice


-Single-payer


-Remove Pelosi and Schumer, and instead nominate AOC/leftist for the house majority leader and Bernie/Gillibrand/Warren for Senate majority leader


-Audit the FBI/CIA/Pentagon/Military


-Enact the Wyoming rule (population of smallest state dictates how many house members there are. Which would add about another hundred Representatives)


-Open boarders and allow all asylum seekers to enter the country, with a path to citizenship for all of them


-Reduce military spending too only $100B and spend the rest on diplomacy and environmental conservation (including planting trees to reduce desertification)



Fuck process, fuck norms, fuck procedure. We are about to have a constitutional, ecological, and global crisis... There Isn't Enough Time to play footsie with the GOP and moderatesHonestly, the best Netflix Stand-up I have ever seenLook at 2020, it is it best chance at taking back the Senate in a big way. If we also get a democratic house and presidency, we can enact any legislation we want. I'm saying that if given the opportunity we should enact all of that legislation and more in the next two years.


We have way too many moderates pulling us down, it's time to make them nut up or shut up. You cannot sit in the middle while our country falls apart. Well his (likely) replacement is an oil industry guy. Worked for Murray, the oil baron that sued John Oliver over his coverage.  
  
Edit: coal industry, coal baron, not oil. Credit u/andrewmetworthThey don't need to be leftist, but the Democratic party has to be pulled leftward on certain issues and any corporate Dem has a 0% chance of enacting any progressive legislation. Also, I would hope the next leaders of the party would not sell out Maxine Waters and AOC. Calling for civility is bullshit and it does nothing to energize the Democratic base.Ask yourself, honestly, what is the point of boarders?


Does having boarders...


-strengthen the economy? No.


-reduce crime? No.


-help asylum seekers? No.


-improve diplomacy? No.


Boarders and our immigration policy have no use besides creating an "other" for bigots to blame. Stop asking yourself about whether it obeys the law/policy. Ask yourself what is the purpose of the law and who the law benefits.You are correct. Anybody know what video the rant on tax cuts for the rich at the end of the ep is from? Looking through Crowder’s YouTube but not turning it up. I feel like Crowder could have great success if he chose to enter politics with the way he communicates.  
  
Edit: [found it on FB](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1656927384342714&amp;id=160389977329803&amp;refsrc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;_rdr)The censoring is done in the videos he releases on certain platforms. Tracked down the video of his rant at the end on Facebook and it’s censored there, so they just copied the audio from that. Exactly! Why do we need to waste money on deportation? Those who come only as a last resort. They idea that gang members are swarming our boarders is a racist assumption with no discernable facts behind it. I assume there are members who do cross our boarders, but we should build a strong enough infrastructure that they can be helped into becoming effective US citizens.


I know this sounds like a crazy idea. But as progressives, we shouldn't just assume the society we currently have, we should envision our optional society and evaluate how we get thereCriticisms are fine, but this is no time for division. The time for discussion and strife was before the midterms. 

I like the energy those guys bring. Perhaps they can help move the overton window back to the left a little bit. The Chapo guys can be very funny (see the episode where they go over Ben Shapiro’s war novel), but when they make fun of people on their own team, it’s suuuuuper try-hardy. Dope.

Have fun getting those agendas through, then. Your strategy of arguing the whole fucking way has really paid dividends...Hey, I'm a chapo listener,  and if you are interested in hearing more left leaning analysis and find chapo grating (I might agree, they are more of a comedy show IMO), I would really suggest "Citations Needed" by Nema Shirazi (spelling?) for media analysis or the "Current Affairs" podcast for inter-left policy discussion.Hey, I listen to both, and the Chapo crew can be fairly dickish. And generally, they claim that Pod and pod types are too focused on being a "big tent" and on being "wonks" or "lanyards" that they inherently fail to generate public enthusiasm and play into right wing traps of compromising when they are in the majority. I think there's a kernel of truth in that, that the democratic party needs some sort of ideological underpinning to drive voter engagment. The question is, always, how far should that sort of thing go?So I don't have the episode itself, but I found it on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYp_6DcUzbU). Chapo is full of terrible people that are sad because their podcast is becoming less and less relevant. The Wilderness just hit #1 on the iTunes charts like every new Crooked Media podcast has done. Meanwhile, Chapo is nowhere to be found on the overall Top 200 podcasts list. To find theirs, you have to go into News &amp; Politics specifically and scroll aaaaall the way down to #86, right behind Michael Savage. They would love nothing more than to get a response from Crooked Media so people will start listening to them again.There's a difference between saying they're becoming "less and less relevant" and saying they're "irrelevant". They're trying to bait someone, anyone from Crooked into a response so they can start a "feud" to boost their listeners. They're trying to recapture their 2016 glory.They may have convinced more saps to give them money, but the iTunes charts don't lie. They were frequently in the Top 50 overall most listened-to podcasts throughout 2016. They've fallen all the way out of the Top 200 completely and I don't remember the last time I saw them there.Obama's administration lost thousands of downballot seats. The people didn't get out to votenot that im complaining but whats the reasoning behind releasing the first 4 episodes on the same day?.. Tommy has to listen to This American Life, most recent rerun this weekend dealt with Fermi’s Paradox and Drake’s equation both of which he brought up during an ad. Maybe Baader Meinhof phenomenon, seems unlikely. Fermi’s Paradox and Drake’s Equation, so hot right now. I feel pretty certain onions are—so at least we can be comforted about that!! This is why I never bought the book, I don't care about Obama. I care about the current Democratic crisis we are in and how we solve it.


This is also similar to my fear with the new CM podcast. I think it's going to be a bunch of centrists who reminisce about "norms and civility" when honestly we need big ideas and actual leftists who are the future of the party. But you can only expect so much from liberal Washington operatives.Universal basic income is a solution worth exploring. Great interview! I'm glad that Crooked has a lot of diversity behind the scenes and practices what they preach. Also, Hysteria is great and I need me some MerchBut people listening to Lovett or Leave It absolutely do. She can save her bullshit, I had to stop listening and delete this garbage 17 minutes in when she started talking about how she was getting raped by Republicans and Democrats. She can go fuck herself.Not just that, she brought up "vaseline" and how the only difference is that Republicans use less. She was outrageous, I didn't last 20 minutes into this one.You think I tune and most other people tune into Lovett or Leave It to hear about how Republicans and Democrats are the exact same and, not only that, how the only difference is that Democrats are slightly less aggressive in their rape? That is lunacy, absurd, and offensive. The fact that we're still talking like this in 2018 when Republicans are about to end Roe and have a policy of putting children in concentration camps is insane. Go back to early 2016 where you belong.You're right, I'm not a Jill Stein voter. You and Melina can go vote Green yet again in 2020 and see how that goes for you.I agree. She tried to have a Jon Stewart on Crossfire moment, when nobody involved on that show or listening at home deserved that."Nazis and Social Democrats both rape working class Germans, only the Nazis use slightly less vaseline! Therefore I, the sophisticated German, will be voting for the Communist Party in 1932! What could possibly go wrong?"Trump made a push to invade Venezuela last year and has brought us much closer to war with Iran and you think there's no difference between the parties on foreign policy?Yeah if you want to make a point don’t be ignorant about it. “Name a democrat” is clearly asking for a single democrat, followed by “Oh just one?” Lovett could’ve listed 10 and she would’ve moved on to “You can only name 10?”  
  
When “sticking to her guns” is just moving the goal posts when it’s shown she’s unaware. I live in a “working community” and the neighbor I’m closest to has talked about the FBI agent and the texts. He’s pretty up to date on the Russia deal bc of his disdain (rightfully so) for Trump. To say that black families aren’t paying attention to the trump Russia thing closely is bullshit.   
  
It’s also demeaning to those families to say they can’t handle all the shit thrown their way and still pay attention to the scandal. I can assure you the minority community has the means and intelligence to both. I checked Lovett’s Twitter mentions and there are plenty of black people saying Abdullah was outrageous. Black people are not this monolithic thing: they can walk and chew gum at the same time, just like they can care about Russia and what’s going on in impoverished communities.May I borrow it when you’re done?Very apt metaphor. You’d lose every game, but hey, you took the high road! This is where the democrats are at in a lot of areas. You really think LOLI or really any Crooked Media podcast doesn't talk about things that matter to black people? On the contrary, they do that almost *every single episode*. It's as if there are some people that want that to be the *only* thing they talk about. If you think it's inappropriate to be talking about the Russia investigation, something that has consumed the federal government for over a year, on the biggest set of Democratic podcasts out there, I don't know what to tell you.I agree with the fact that the FBI is *generally* not good, but someone like Peter Strzok certainly *is* good. I also hear from a lot of other outlets that Reddit is a cesspool of misogyny and racism and conspiracy theories (which is it!) and that everyone that posts here is bad (which they aren't). Do you as a Redditor want to be lumped in with the idiots that post on T_D? Is that fair to you?You are 100% right, and that CN episode was very illuminating at the problem with the FBI. It's core mission is to lock people up, doesn't really matter if you deserve it or notExactly, good only serve the Bougeoisie and the privileged. Black people naturally have a disdain towards cops because they never know if they will treat them as a human, or abuse their power. Not just history, but currently they face that harsh truth.It's not an "edgelord" position if you are currently facing homelessness in CA.Nope. In Washington state, you still get tips AND you get the natural $11.50 minimum wage. That is the fight.


There is no way to get rid of tooling, but make it so workers don't have to rely on the generosity of patrons for them to liveShe doesn't need to suggest shit. It's not her job to know the exact way to break systemic oppression by the Dems, she is pointing it out and making people aware of issues that a lot of suburban white people ignoreIf we don't change things now, we will never change. The Democrats had eight years to change under Obama and did nothing. 

And again, you cannot hold minorities ransom to the Democratic party. It's the candidates job to listen to their constituents and fight for them.Maybe don't be so offended when someone in your team calls you outYes?... How would they not?Nope. You can call it institutional racism if you want, or liberal white supremacy. But in the end, they are both when the liberals directly implement policies that are targeted at non-whites. Bill Clinton did it with the drug wars he co-signed with Congress, the Democratic Congress did it when they came out pro-Iraq war, and when Obama continued to reach up drone civilian casualties. We can't run from our past.And how is Obama's legacy doing?

-ACA? stripped away

-Abortion/LGBTQ rights? overturned soon

-Abolishing private prisons? recinded


He tried to capitulate to the middle and failed. So instead of looking left, he kept on shifting right which lead the Dems to losing 1000 seats. You can't argue how good Obama did without acknowledging that he was complicit in creating the weak corporate centrist Democrats that are in Congress today.


Hell! Chuck Schumer can't even convince 5 Democrats not to vote for a partisan anti-abortion hack to be appointed in the supreme Court.The GOP didn't just take over three wings of Congress, they also control...

The judiciary

Law enforcement/FBI

CIA

State houses

Governorships

City counsels

They literally control every facet of this country under Obama's watch, all the while this country is progressive by at least a 5 point spread. This isn't some accident, this happened because the Democrats appealed to the invisible middle while ignoring their progressive base. The Dems lost everything, it's now time for them to try another strategy and seeing hard left. Because, if you have to choose a party that fights for workers, minorities, and the less fortunate or a fascist GOP, ALL THE PROGRESSIVES WILL VOTE WITH THE DEMS.


&gt;So by this logic, if in 2020 Trump loses and. Dem takes overs and gets rid of a bunch of his EOs and a more friendly Congress helps shore up the ACA and even expands it, will you then say Trump's legacy was weakened because the didn't go to the right enough? 
Military


Trump's legacy will not fail because he has confirmed 2 Supreme Court justices, which will take at least 30 years to fix. His legacy is stamped in the tax breaks that will never come back to the public. His alienation of allied nations will not be forgotten or forgiven for a long time. Those debts he is racking up will take decades to lower. And when we get our next inevitable recession, the value of the US dollar will fall.


&gt;Had Obama gone more to the left (whatever that means) in 2012 and  2014, it's highly unlikely that more people would have rushed to support candidates in primaries.  


Going right hasn't worked! Have you seen Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in NY? The progressives haven't been this active in democracy in a long time. They are there, but just need to actually be heard by the Dems. And you underestimate the people in Kentucky, Texas, West Virginia, etc. They used to be a lot more progressive due to the worker unions.That's not their fear, that's your fear, don't push that idea onto the workers. Unless you got some sources in that data, then I will accept that premise. But, if you don't then it is obvious that you would rather keep the shitty status quo and not try to fix the service industry.I think your definition of white supremacy is way too thin. Would you not argue Red Lining was white supremacy? My point is that you can be a well meaning Democrat, but if you put in a policy that disproportionately affects those who aren't white, then it is liberal white supremacy.They were really,  _really_ sure Hillary was going to win and it is embarrassing in hindsight. &gt; There is an insufficient defense of their approach to healthcare where the administration compromised on so much before the debate even started, all to avoid the kind of Republican attacks that were lobbed at the ACA anyway.

Probably because Favreau et al. thought it was dumb to concede so much before starting. The podcast guests say so clearly in the episode. Maybe they didn't think it at the time, but this episode very clearly implies that they think so now.Amanda Litman's recap of her 2016 election night...oof. That hit really close to home, it got my heart racing just rehashing it.This might be my favorite episode so far! Maybe it's because there's no election night coverage that gives me anxiety for reliving it (my heart!), but the discussions in this episode are set up well. I like the interspersing of the focus groups, the call-ins, and the pollsters/analysts' interviews that it flows well for me.&gt;Things Republicans could do instead of send sad tweets

&gt;1. Pass legislation to protect the Mueller investigation
2. Subpoena Trump's tax and business records to see what leverage Russia may have on him
3. Pass a tougher sanctions law that doesn't let Trump wriggle out of them
4. Hold hearings on what has and hasn't been done to protect America from Russia
5. Subpoena the interpreter to find out what Trump actually said to Putin
6. Pass a joint resolution saying Russia interfered in the elections to help Trump.

&gt;Reminder with the Republicans needing nearly every vote for Kavanaugh -- Flake, McCain, Sasse, et al have never had more leverage.In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and that nothing was true. ... Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness.” 

― Hannah Arendt, The Origins of TotalitarianismThis is one of those subplots that I keep getting flabbergasted is never brought up in conversation.

Like, what are the chances that certain Republicans are being blackmailed into halting or derailing the investigation due to info gained from the RNC hack? Although I can't imagine how bad it could be that you literally become a puppet for an adversary - even most of the DNC/Podesta stuff wasn't THAT BAD, just kind of embarrassing, or else campaign strategy.My guess is they stay here until the Trump tide has passed. They'll try to stay informative but neutral in the 2020 primary. I doubt they'd ever work for the White House again.

Lovett, though, could be very serious when he jokes about running for congress.Drinking game for the ep: take a shot every time Symone says “girl chat”&gt; If you put out a ton of lies and bullshit, people will just believe everything is lies and bullshit and believe nothing, not even the truth. That is Russia's main strategy.

Exactly. The entire backbone to "whataboutism" is the idea that everyone is doing it, so it doesn't matter and you shouldn't care. Fortunately, we all know better than to give into cynicism and defeat. 

This is one of my favorite quotes:

&gt; In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and that nothing was true. ... Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow.

― Hannah Arendt, The Origins of Totalitarianismlol my dude did Ziwe key your car or something? That's surely not it because I would be horribly disappointed if they spent even a cent on his site for this.It looks like typed. Apparently [you can download a font that looks like Trump's handwriting](https://www.fastcompany.com/3064790/donald-trumps-crazy-handwriting-is-now-a-free-font-called-tiny-hand), so they probably printed it out.I love  WTF Just HappenedIt’s almost like that’s a bullshit stereotype designed to discredit the left and has never actually been true. I love the Wilderness, that being said, we are to the point of cannibalism now where I haven't listened to Deray or Kander's shows because there is just too much content. 'People telling Joe Lieberman to go fuck himself' is the content I crave.For those who love Comey getting some heat, the latest episode of Wait Wait Don’t Tell Me was great. It’s lighthearted of course, but man Peter Sagal got some real poignant zingers in. My favorite game contestant on the show in a while. Owning the fascists by *checks notes* paying them $200I am ready and willing to vote for this ballot measure in Michigan. (salute)Yes! Thank you! 

All these guests and certainly the hosts were absolutely hostile to this progressive democratic-socialist rhetoric as of 3-6 months ago. They outright ignored or avoided Bernie and his message long after the election was over, papering over any of his beliefs with all that "He's so close to Hillary, does it even make a difference?" talk. 

Now that you have a charming DSA candidate come to the fore and opinion of Bernie hasn't wavered much, everyone seems to be die-hard progressive. I welcome the change, but I also do not welcome the silence these people leave behind in the wake of their change. Emily Bazelon on Slate's Political Gabfest mentioned two weeks ago that she totally missed the mark on Bernie and underestimated his movement during the election and afterwards. I admire that kind of candor and willingness to *not pretend like you were supportive of democratic socialism this whole time*. 

I remember on podcasts before (PSA maybe?) where they'd lay into the "far" left for not having ways to pay for all their, you know, educating children and providing healthcare for all. Then they'd complain about division and infighting within the democratic party and lack of "clear messaging" by the Old Guard. Then they'd reduce Republican spending to cheap punchlines and baste in their hypocrisy. 

I know your point was not as critical, but I've listened to every pod of theirs for the last year and change, and this pivot to the left after Ocasio is so dramatic, and fails to be accompanied on any reflection as to why it took so long. Bernie's message just sounds more palatable when he has a late 20s hispanic primary candidate next to him, I guess. It gives them due cause to dismiss concerns because they can cite being brigaded from the "far left" or whatever. It’s almost worse that they admitted that Bernie’s criticism held water a year ago and then did little to provide him, the most popular senator in America and the underdog that coalesced millions of independent voters, little to no platform on their left-leaning media outlet. 

They had a whole debate on what the dems new slogan should be, and literally none of the hosts mentioned Bernie’s “Protect Working Families”. Each word is better than the last, and each word plays well across the isle and, most of all, espouses a healthy morality. It literally never made its way into their discourse. 

Also four white men not listening to another older white man because he’s old and white is so fucking absurd to me. I don’t get it. I really just don’t get it. All their wingeing and whining about how democrats seem to be lost in the wilderness sickens me. Where do we go from here?!?! 

There’s literally only one way. Left. You’re not going right. 

Theyve had their answer all along. They were just too arrogant to consider it. For the shortening of the capital gains tax change:

* "Billions for billionaires"

* "Handouts for Hedge Funds"

* "'Thank God for Trump!' -Billionaires"

* "Tax cuts for the rich, budget cuts for American families."

* "Coupon cutting for American families, tax cutting for American billionaires."Ha yeah... some of these might be better billboards. The 'both sides" narrative is fucking bullshit. People want consistency with punishment, but this really shows Facebook's hand. They have inclination to fairly judge liberal or leftist content, but give alt-right platforms a gracious turn of the cheek. It's because IW and other conservative platforms make a big stink about it whenever any little moderation happens. But leftists and progressives shouldn't sit back anymore, they need to fight back when they reference undue punishment. It's the only way to keep the spread of information fair.There’s a company called Bird which puts dockless scooters in cities that you can unlock and use with an app on your phone. It’s like a scooter version of Zipcar, but without designated parking spaces, so you can stop and leave the scooter wherever you’d like (sidewalk, outside a store or restaurant, etc.) I don’t listen to it much, but my wife does, and when he has a guest that’s not just some movie star I’ll give it a download.I’ll have to check the Sedaris ep out! It was VERY weird not hearing the pod open with "Welcome to Pod Save America, I'm Jon Favreau". Not *bad*, just weird.Agreed! Franken was an inspiring progressive voice, but he threw it away. It reminds me of Anthony Weiner in a way, because he was an inspiring senator who did everything he could to stand up for his constituents. But his actions he chose to make in his life brought him down. These men had a real chance at the presidency, or at the very least a progressive leader. I read his book and followed him, but there was no coming back from 8 credible harassment allegations.Fuck those Democratic donors! They are part of the problem and I hope they keep coming out against Gillibrand. She is actually one of the top 3 most progressive senators and seems to understand where there base is going.All the crooked pods except Friends Like These and hysteria (haven’t tried).

I do a lot of podcast listening. For some reason I quit listening to every ep when they stopped naming them by day/date. Now I see some titles and think “meh” and don’t listen. Yeah especially since they started doing multiple episode series around the same time. I like the format of going in depth on a current news story then touching on other news, but stretching a story across multiple eps is not what I listen for. Yeah they set up a new podcast for that one deep dive series on ISIS which I enjoyed a lot. And they have The New Washington which I wish they’d put more eps out of. They could have a separate pod for all their deep dive stuff and keep the daily just daily news. Up First still does a good job of covering the big daily news stories of you haven’t tried that. Other than PSA, LOLI, Keep It, PS the World, PS the People, and Hysteria:

Fake the Nation (Negin Farsad talks news with a different pair of folks each week—she’s awesome and has been on LOLI)

On the Media (consistently awesome dive into what is happening and how it intersects with the media)

Opening Arguments (covers the law in he news)

Alice Isn’t Dead (fiction and beautiful)

How Did This Get Made? (bad movies hilariously discussed. Lovett was on the garbage pail kids one)

In the Thick (news discussions hosted by Maria Hinojosa who is awesome)

Still Processing (New York Times culture podcast)

Pop Rocket (Guy Branum—who was on LOLI this week—et al talk culture)

LARB Radio Hour ( interview with a writer  LA Review of Books is generally a great source of good essays about literature, politics etc)

In Our Time (BBC history, culture, art, science etc)

TrumpcastWhereas The Daily does a deep dive on one issue then lists other things going on, Up First goes through more items adding a little context for each thing. It’s slanted towards political news but covers other things as well, not much pop culture news and such. I think NPR does a great job journalistically with their podcasts, you might try Rough Translation too. It reports about stories in other countries that relate to things going on in the US. They’ve had some amazing episodes surrounding the Russia investigation. Terry Gross is one of the best interviewers out there.  
  
Edit: Dave Davies does a great job filling in also. There are a couple reasons why evangelicals tend not to be pro-environment. They all overlap a little bit but they're not all exclusive.

1) They believe that, because God created the world for humanity, He wouldn't let it be destroyed by human hands. There is a feeling of 'God's not going to let people wreck the Earth' among a lot of evangelical Christians.

2) Science and scientists and academia are viewed as actively anti-religion and anti-believer (not just atheist or agnostic, but militantly anti-theist), so anything that comes out of a scientist's or university's viewpoint is immediately met with skepticism.

3) A lot (like, a *lot*) of evangelicals think that the Rapture/Apocalypse/end of times will happen soon, in their lifetime. Environmental protection seems silly in that case. After all, why bother fixing your air vents if you're just going to move into a new house soon? Subjects like Israel and abortion are far more pressing and important to them.I loved his rant after the trump footage of him clearly not knowing the words to God Boess America. I think it’s the most fired up he’s been on the pod. Just watch this and you will see where I am coming from

https://youtu.be/tD20-FihJQsI would argue that we already do, whereas the GOP never questions their own party.  What ends up happening is when the GOP is in power the Dems are complaining, when the Dems are in power both Dems and Republicans are complaining.  To swing voters it appears that both parties are just as bad.  I get that Kara Brown has made her living being outraged at white nonsense, but this scooter-hate thing is crazy. Commuters found a sustainable method of transport that hurts the environment less and takes cars off the street? Because it annoys you slightly, why, exactly? Except Pokémon Go was a game, and this is a transportation solution. Maybe not fleshed out in totality, but it’s an encouraging step away from congested streets and over-reliance on fossil fuels. Bitch yes I get that it doesn’t match the aesthetic you have imagined for the city or whatever, but get over yourself. It’s bigger than you. 

Not you you, her I mean. Hey fellow Atlanta native! 

Yes, any sustainable solution to cars should be encouraged, not denounced because it bothers you on some ethereal level. “I just don’t like scooters, I want to throw them in the trash” - sorry Kara, you can’t just be mad at shit all the time as a substitute for personality. When there’s also many benefits to something and you hate it for silly reasons that serve to perpetuate a narrative about yourself, people should think less of you. I use Podkicker. Not sure how it compares to others but it doesn't crash. (shrug)He literally said Country Club Republicans are not who we should be going for.It’s really telling that Ana would ask a short and simple question that Rick would need minutes and minutes to unpack. For example, when he starts to compare Trump and Obama supporters, she simply asks, “but what about tone? Doesn’t tone matter a lot?”. You could hear how he knew she was right. 

I also like how his speciality is shitty campaign ads. Like, really? That’s what you’re good for? Being a garbage human being? You think it takes special skill to make an offensive campaign ad? And you have no moral qualms?

Can’t wait to have that sexy ass voice on my outgoing voicemail. I preordered Pfeiffer’s book (was really pleased with it, great listen with the self-narration on audible) to get the signed insert. So when Kander was offering a signed insert with inscription I jumped on it. Got the book and insert in the mail last week and hope to start in on it soon. For the inscription I wanted a reminder to stay involved. Little corny, but it was the best I could come up with ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯Thanks bot I fixed it. He talked about it on PSA in the weeks before the release. I preordered on audible but I plan on grabbing a used hard copy to put the signed insert in. Rhodes book on audible is great too. Wish he had narrated it though, not that the narrator wasn’t good but I love self-narrated books. She lucked out getting an early release! Cool that she got to have him sign it too. Ocasio-Cortez is (deservedly) getting a lot of media hype, but I'm hoping that Tlaib gets some as well, because she deserves it and can give really great interviews.Louis describing Ted Cruz as all of the McDonald's mascots rolled into one is so spot on.  Would’ve been the perfect ep for a quip ad. They have the best ads in all of podcasting imo. The producer killed it with that. I mean that’s capitalism. Companies have no motive but profit. The people have the power to make doing good profitable for companies (except in the cases of the increasing monopolization) by choosing where there money goes. Support companies that do good and boycott those that don’t. Not saying that’s the way it should be, but that’s the way it is. &gt;in practice I don’t think it ever does.  
  
It most certainly does, look at the work of the Sleeping Giants for just one example. There’s also the movement away from plastic straws that’s been in the media lately.  
  
&gt; it's becoming increasingly difficult to boycott for moral reasons the companies that make almost everything we buy on a regular basis.  
  
This was my point on the increased monopolization. Monopolies strip power from citizens, it’s one of many reasons trust busting is good for consumers. It’s a shame the government forgot or quit caring about this, but they’re incentivized by their corporate donors to do just that.  
  
&gt;only a small fraction cares enough  
  
Not exercising power =/= not having power to exercise. Consumers could choose to care and I think we’re starting to see this more. What do you think their big announcement will be?Wow. Not saying this as a bad thing necessarily, but what a bummer episode to have as the season finale. It’s crazy to contrast this episode with the season premiere, which was full of energy and hope from Lin Manuel Miranda.

This episode was incredibly depressing for me, because I felt that the woman was really struggling to open up to Jason. She recently went through this traumatic experience, and she’s clearly using her faith as a coping mechanism. I hope that works out for her, but I didn’t feel too great about it as the episode ended.

I feel like this would have been a much better fit if Ana had done the interview and had recorded it with her podcast.Overall great episode. I was a bit disappointed that they essentially just provided a history lesson of Obama’s visit to Cuba, and didn’t really contrast it with current events. For example, a comparison of Obama’s trip to Cuba with Trump’s visits with Un/Putin would have been enlightening.Good episode overall. 

Man, they were so mean to that kid running for governor though!Yeah, he's just a kid... I don't see why it's something to make fun of. The Ben Rhodes show, as anticipated.

&gt; Marcy Wheeler: "American exceptionalism increasingly means denial on the part of Americans that other countries can compete with us, and will... We will be eventually held accountable for our breaches of norms, for our breaches of human rights overseas. And I think we need to have an accounting of what a faith in American exceptionalism has done over the last 70 years."


** BEAT **

&gt; Jon Favreau: "Ben Rhodes agrees that we need to redefine what American exceptionalism truly means, that what makes America exceptional isn't our military or our economy or some cultural identity that has to do with what you look like or where you came from; it's something else."


That exchange alone is a demonstration of the complete lack of understanding Favs brought to this episode. Marcy Wheeler isn't looking to redefine American exceptionalism. She (and anyone else on the Left) is seeking to tear down the idea that America is anything other than a hegemonic power that has ruthlessly pursued its own interests in a way that has destabilized many foreign countries and threatened the lives of millions of people. America can not and should not be trusted to be the judge, jury and executioner in the international community. American exceptionalism is bunk.

&gt; I think this is just another example of Andrew Cuomo trying to figure out what a progressive sounds like and missing by a mile.

-- Cynthia NixonLovett trying to mend fences with Lenny Davis, and Tommy and Jon quickly shooting it down, was so good.It’s weird how popular they are with mattress companies. First Casper, then Helix, now Sleep Number. The champion briefs that are a mid ground between stretch sweat wicking material and plain cotton are the best briefs I’ve ever had. Terrible conversation about Boots Riley &amp; Spike LeeYeah, I agree. When it was men perpetuating the crime the conversation was all about the abuse and their awful behavior. Not once did they mention how Kevin Spacey had his own "hurt people hurt people" history with his abusive father. I know Argento is no Spacey, but they definitely didn't hammer home the fact that **she used her power to sexually abuse an underage student of hers.** Kara was literally more concerned with the statement than the fact that this leader of the MeToo movement was an abuser the whole time, and had the fucking gall to stand up with victims of harassment and belittle the men in power silencing the abused. She totally breezed by the horrific nature of the abuse and focused more on how it will impact the image of MeToo ("A movement like this should have no leader, lol, it's Tarana Burke though"). It's like when people worried how Louis CK's revelations would impact his directing career rather than focusing on how he exposed himself to women at work. 

No wonder Shapiro and the right wing pundits talk about this with glee. They've correctly identified hypocrisy in our midst that we need to address so as to evolve as a party and ideology. It bothers me a little because during the primaries they mocked left-of-center leftism. Bernie was literally just a joke to them. Rather than drifting slowly and covertly to the left, I wish they'd start organizing with unions and using language and ideology that appeals to leftist senibilities, like Medicare for all and union organization. 

Either go hard or go home, and it seems like Favs is going home, Vietor is changing jerseys from Neo-lib blue to leftist red, and Lovett is charging the end zone. "As Harriet Tubman once said, if you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best!"

LOUIS VIRTEL YOU SAVAGE Ohmygod. Are you Tommy??AHHH Cool cool cool. Well and maybe she's super busy working on something else, idk. Thanks for the clarification. I saw that the PSA guys all followed her on Twitter, and they often reference the Daily so I assumed they knew about *Caliphate* as well. Except in my house. They only way the kids get money sent to them (rather than handed in dirty bundles) is the CashApp. The deconstruction of the surveillance state. US would be awful under total socialism just as it would be under total capitalism. We need a mix of free markets with social programs and safety nets. Don’t ignore all the great things capitalism made possible, it’s a big reason we have been an innovation powerhouse for so many decades. We’ve really innovated new ways to grind poor people into offal and to ensure that like 7 people have 90% of the world’s wealth &gt;We haven’t been innovating for decades now.  
  
What a joke. How about smartphones and the mobile data networks they run on? How about that website google you can search for answers to anything on? Or streaming TV? Or how about this website you’re on right now? Complete ignorance to say the US hasn’t been innovating many things the past decades. Higher tax rates on the wealthy, splitting up monopolies, and better social welfare programs/safety nets would go a long way to fix that. Complete socialism is not the only other option and it’s an awful one. Capitalism is rly good and inspires innovation but we also have to take all these ideas from socialism to keep it from killing everyone. Also it might’ve accidentally destroyed the world in like 300 yearsJust want to note you’ve moved the goal posts from the US hasn’t been innovating to only in entertainment and “literally nothing else that helps the base lives of the working class,” but I’ll still debate your latest point. It’s also wrong. Do you think the working class does not have access to smartphones and their data networks or internet? They do. And cellphones alone have improved the lives of the working class. Google is a recent thing that the working class can use to find information on nearly any topic for free. The access to knowledge for the working class has never been greater, easier, or cheaper. To say that hasn’t helped their lives is foolish. But it’s not just that.  
  
There are other things stemming from the internet that have improved the lives of the middle class. Online banking for one. Do you not think that having checks deposited automatically and being able to use debit cards is an improvement on the working class’ lives?  
  
Also, pharmaceutical breakthroughs have also drastically improved the lives of the working class living with disease. Yes, many treatments are too expensive and I believe health insurance should be socialized. But without pharmaceutical innovation (stemming from a capitalist structure), the treatments wouldn’t even exist for the middle class to have access to. I agree we need a mix of capitalist and socialist ideas. I don’t see exactly what your last point is. If you’re talking global warming, China is one of the biggest contributors in the recent decade and they are not a capitalist country. If you’re talking nuclear weapons, the nuclear weapons race was between a capitalist and communist country. If you think I’m not part of the working class you are wrong. I work a manual labor job and live in the hood. I’m just not ignorant to the ways capitalism has provided innovations that have improved my life compared to someone in my same situation decades ago. I mean we do have a fairly sane Conservative party—the Democrats. They’re fairly right-wing by the standards of every other country. State capitalist, maybe, but the communist party is in charge and they have claimed themselves to be a socialist country. State capitalism isn’t really close to pure capitalism. Means of production lying in control of the state is pretty far from most forms of capitalism. Tell me how it’s fucked billions of others. I mentioned the examples that were right in front of my face, if you don’t think they were true innovations you are just wrong. What the agencies are doing. Climate change—it comes up but not enough given what it is and what it means and the fact that we are in, of and causing it. I keep emailing them in my never ending quest to get then to at least mention [Out Children’s Trust ](https://www.ourchildrenstrust.org) . But their federal suit started during Obama’s term so perhaps it’s an uncomfortable thing. They are, however, one of the most hopeful and amazing groups re climate change out there. &gt; It's just a personality quirk, like how many surges you put in your coffee.

I'm betting that was an autocorrect of 'sugars', but the image of someone pouring a can of Surge into a cup of coffee is so good.From the [wonderful piece](https://splinternews.com/the-myth-of-john-mccain-1828587230) by Paul Blest in *Splinter*:

&gt; McCain’s political legacy should be largely that of someone who frequently and loudly toyed with doing the right thing and yet decided to do the other thing almost every single time, and who was a willing and active participant in the destruction of one country and helping the racist, authoritarian right rise in his own. What John McCain’s legacy will be, however, is the one crafted by the reporters and peers who loved him, who bought hook, line, and sinker that McCain was a different kind of politician, and not the fraud he actually was. Seems to me it’d be the responsible thing to disclose Lovett’s relationship with farrow when covering his reporting. Are you serious? Please tell me this isn't serious. I don’t think it’s a conflict on the order of the likes of Hannity and his exposed connections to Cohen. Especially since they weren’t reported on Farrow but on a report authored by farrow. But I think to be 100% on the level it should have been disclosed. A good example, though he’s not a journalist, is Preet Bharara. Since he worked with many of the people he now talks about he is always careful to disclose his connections to those people including the guests he has on. Welcome! I was known as the outspoken Republican in my high school when I graduated back in the mid-00s. I stayed Republican until Hurricane Katrina hit and I took a closer look at why my first inclination was to defend the indefensible response we were all seeing in New Orleans. That led me down a long journey that ended with me shifting my paradigm on a whole lot of things. 

You seem very open-minded, so you might want to read a left-wing book soon. I read Stupid White Men and Dude Where's My Country? by Michael Moore and Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them by Al Franken soon after my conversion and they were instrumental in shaping my new political views and how I now look at old sources like Fox News that I used to revere. Those books are funny and very accessible. If someone else has a good recommendation for a more recent book, please chime in.I can't with to hear the boys tell us how they're actually super progressive and not just recent centrist converts. I heard that they were both pretty poor. And I think it will be much closer than you expect after the revelation of when the Weinstein case was dropped. We've seen over and over again this cycle how well female candidates have done vs. male ones on the Democratic side.Fair enough. I don't live in NY and don't have a vested interest either way.I love them, but they can’t just engage through every left wing progressive through Lovett. They talk about their progressive politics and progressive ideas all the time, but they’re obviously uncomfortable talking about real left (read: socialist) politics, like public education, transport, and healthcare. 

They’re progressive on social activism, but they’re not exactly economically progressive. My first comment was way too salty, granted :) but my grievance is only light. If Crooked Media is actually progressive, I’d like to see them talk about government-funded insurance and education, using language that specifically endorses such policy. But they don’t. They just put up Lovett, whose always been the most vocally economic progressive, so Favs and Vietor can remain uncompromisingly centrist. 

That’s been my impression at least. Episodes talking about election stuff are so much more fun than episodes talking about the latest Trump insanity.For me, I think it comes from a place of intentions. John McCain was almost always more wrong than he was right, but he *usually* truly believed he was doing the good and righteous thing most of the time. McCain did champion the Iraq War, you're exactly right, but at least he ended up declaring it a mistake this year. Most of these assholes would rather die than admit they were wrong on Iraq. At least admitting it was wrong makes it less likely that we'll repeat that mistake again. Others that championed the Iraq War at the time included Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Dianne Feinstein, and John Kerry. Should we not mourn them when they eventually die too? Maybe your answer is yes and I respect that, but I do fundamentally disagree.Agreed. The first post-midterm pod will hopefully be fun to the point of orgasming instead of contemplating suicide. I feel like there won't be any in between.It was sort of a beautiful moment. He managed Evan McMullin's campaign which directly took between 500,000 and 1,000,000 votes away from Trump nationally. I don't know how much more of an ally you can get. Taking that many away from Trump is more than any person in this sub did. 

He's never pretended to be a liberal, although he does give AMC a lot of lip service when he's on her podcast. Dude is a hardcore gun nut, I'm talking hardcore Wayne LaPierre-style gun nut.All I know is he was partially responsible for a great amount of Clinton's final popular vote percentage that Trump has been agonizing over since 2016. I'll always be grateful for that. He's very clearly an asshole though and I'm not saying otherwise.Why should people vote in states guaranteed to go one way or another at all by that logic? 

Can you point to someone in this sub that did more to hurt Trump in 2016 than Rick Wilson? Again, I'm not saying he's some saint that succeeded in his goal, he didn't. But McMullin accounted for giving Clinton at least 20% of her overall popular vote total and up to about a third by some estimates. That is absolutely significant.I see the Chapo dudes are out in full force today.I think that's fair. Rick Wilson, Chapo, this sub, Andrew Gillum...we're all ultimately on the same side here. I'll go back to warring with Rick Wilson as soon as Trump is out of office.It bothers the hell out of him though and it's very obvious to see. Depends on what "side" you're looking at. I'm not on your side or Wilson's side politically. Chapo dudes, Rick Wilson, and myself would all make very different presidents. If we're talking about the side of working to defeat Trump in 2020, I do believe we're all on the same side.I think those things that you listed (Medicare expansion, expanding voting rights, gun legislation) can only happen with a Democrat in the White House though. Which brings us back to the classic chicken or the egg debate with the Bernie wing vs. the rest of the party. If someone's actions make it more likely that a Democrat (honestly any of the major contenders would be someone I can see myself supporting unless I'm missing someone) will be in the White House to sign that legislation in 2021, that person is not someone I'm going to hate on.The people whose posting history indicates that they post a lot on the Chapo sub are those that are usually the biggest assholes in this sub. You can draw your own conclusions as to why that is. The other dude did turn out to be a smart and reasonable person though.What more could he have done? Nobody else in the party wanted to take Trump on and Pennsylvania's ballot deadline had already passed.What does that have to do with Rick Wilson?That shit is wild. You’re on the wrong sub then. Again, I don’t know why you Chapo bros choose to troll this sub. You’re not getting any of us to listen to your podcast or buy the book, you’re wasting your time.I loved Jon's "**Fuck Off!**" when that reporter suggested people like Andrew Gillum and Stacey Abrams are somehow like Sharron Angle and Christine O'Donnell.I bet it's because NBC had a lot of internal #metoo shit going on right now. They are just covering their tracksI believe there was a principal (on twitter maybe, or perhaps even reddit) who said he couldn't caucus in his area because it was very conservative and he couldn't be seen voting for a liberal or else it would affect his job.

Wish I knew where I found that...Avenatti's weird outburst last night notwithstanding, it's been a little weird and unbecoming how much all of Crooked Media attacks him. He's done an incredible job at laying waste to Trump every time he's interviewed by national media. He's eccentric for sure, but he doesn't deserve this hate. It's not like he has any chance against whoever Crooked is backing behind the scenes for 2020, they don't need to be threatened by this guy.I think we all agree with that and only complete fools would vote for Avenatti for president. He has no chance of winning the nomination, like *zero* chance, so why attack him? It would be like attacking Stephen Colbert for one of his fake presidential runs.I have no doubt that Avenatti sees this as a cash grab. You're exactly right that he's an opportunist and honestly he's a little slimy. His profile has exploded like a supernova this year. Still I come back to how effective he is when he's attacking Trump. Compare Avenatti's appearances on the Sunday shows to anyone else's and you'll see that no other Democrat is even in his league right now at dismantling Trump. And if the Stormy Daniels case plays out like Paula Jones, there's a decent chance that Avenatti himself will get to question Trump under oath at a deposition which I would pay a ton of money to see.They do this a lot. Like with Kara and how much she hates electric scooters in LA, because like, why would LA *ever need an alternative to fossil fuel based transportation*. It works the other way too, though. They obsess over things they **do** like, like Niki and literally any feminist. You're either in or you're out. Kara's complaints about electric scooters were that you needed a driver's license and a smartphone to use one, which restricts poor people from using them (and poorer people are their target demo). 

Plus the fact that they block sidewalks, *and* Bird did some really shady stuff in Cambridge/Somerville recently which makes me doubt their progressive credentials (they started operating in these towns, didn't pay the cities for a business permit, then got upset when the cities started confiscating the scooters). Crooked hosts generally have good politics, but IMO their taste in small things like this is *terrible.* “Keep It!” is especially bad at this (Eminem’s album, *The Shape of Water*), and Lovett’s just as bad. Still love them, though, just don’t think we’d get along IRL (other than politics).&gt; like Niki and literally any feminist

You *almost* had an upvote...I’m a feminist, a member of the LGBT community. But I don’t like literally any feminist, and I maintain that they absolutely bungled the conversation about Asia Argento and how MeToo has looked down on sexual violence against anyone that isn’t a woman. Amanda Litman is so great, I love whenever they get her to come on the Pod.It's comforting to know that I travel in the same Twitter circles as the Crooked media staffers.Brian Schatz is good people.I'm not a huge Keith Ellison fan, but there are two women that have made accusations against him.

* One accused him of "verbally abusing" her (not illegal, not even something you can be held civilly liable for), "shoving her out of the way", and breaking her door. This all happened 12 years ago. A judge also seemed to review what happened and sided with Ellison because Ellison was granted a restraining order against his accuser (Amy Alexander) and her request for one against him was denied.

* The other woman accused him of "trying to drag her off the bed" and "knocking the shoe off her foot". 

So there's certainly no sexual abuse there. In the first instance, a judge found him more credible than Alexander and I don't even think what he did was that horrific even if true. Breaking a door is shitty, but not a big deal in isolation. Verbal abuse is *really* shitty, but it's not illegal. It shows that he's an asshole that shouldn't be in relationships. The second example was basically the same thing. More shitty behavior, but not something you would ever get arrested for.

No one has accused Ellison of sexual misconduct. No one has accused Ellison of physically injuring them. They've accused him of being an asshole, which I think he absolutely is. However, saying he's been "credibly accused of domestic abuse" is a huge stretch.

If someone wants to explain to me how I'm wrong, I'm absolutely all ears. I'm obviously coming at this from a male perspective and a female might see things completely differently.Thanks for putting a voice to my thoughts! I went to a high school reunion this last new year where I managed to talk to a lot of my old classmates. When the alcohol began to flow liberally, so did all these weird fucking stories of male classmates being creepy and rapey to the girls, who were now sharing their stories. Something like a two thirds of the guys I considered friends turned out to be absolute perverts. I don’t know how to teach other men that many of us are problematic. 



Shout out to Monica Lewinsky in the Twitter replies! Glad she is a listener 😊She was probably happy to make it into the atone zone. "You can't see me in the photo because I'm *DRIVIIIIIING!*"Did you listen to the episode? What specific things were said that you didn’t like? Everything I heard on this episode were things that this subreddit would be very happy with. I was living for their impression of Rod Rosenstein.

Adds a lot of character to the banter of the crewWe need a Hysteria emergency pod for this shitshowNever watched them like this, pretty nifty. I'm so glad that Erin made Hysteria happen. It's so nice to hear women sympathise with the victim and show solidarity in her traumatic experience.


Almost every one of my gal friends has dealt with sexual assault, which just goes to show how bad rape culture is in the US. If we ever want true equality, women need body autonomy. And the ability to defend their bodies through legal means as well as physical meansI don't know about a regular because I'm set in my ways with the way it is now, but I would absolutely support her being a guest more often. She's very very very very very very good.In the twitter thread someone shows a character is wearing a PSA shirt in an upcoming episode. It’s been a brutal week (of many) but I’m haunted by the Trump admin/NHTSA’s release of a report predicting a 7 deg C rise in global mean temp by 2100 and its conclusion that, therefore, they’ve no reason try to cut emissions. 7 deg is fucking horrifying.   I feel brutalized by watching Kavanaugh and the Republicans on the Senate judiciary committee but this just guts me. 

A quote from the Wash Post. “The amazing thing they’re saying is human activities are going to lead to this rise of carbon dioxide that is disastrous for the environment and society. And then they’re saying they’re not going to do anything about it,” said Michael MacCracken, who served as a senior scientist at the U.S. Global Change Research Program from 1993 to 2002.Comes in at 14:30 on Apple podcasts. If they are having guests, do we presume that Beto and Gillum are sure-things? 

Irvine might have 1 or 2 House people

And Philly? Casey and Wolf are both pretty safe now, not sure they would need the exposure.I think asking the PSA guys to Rachel Dolezal themselves would be worse.Of the 18 Crooked Media hosts (counting the rotating hosts of Hysteria), only 8 are white (Favreau, Lovett, Vietor, Pfeiffer, Kander, Ryan, Mastromonaco, and Virtel)Glad they had a discussion about an issue where not all three of them were in lockstep. I tend to favor Tommy's views on court packing. Once we start and add 2, the Republicans won't just add 2 themselves when they take control of government again one day, they'll add 9 or 11. We all know this. The only way we can keep at least some semblance of sanity is to keep things at 9 and not give them permission to say "well Democrats started it!"That's actually a reasonably persuasive argument. Maybe all things being equal, delegitimizing the Court makes sense. Things aren't equal though. I fail to see how campaigning on a pledge to openly delegitimize the Court is a winning issue and that's coming from someone that's in favor of repealing the Second Amendment within the next decade or two. Impeaching Kavanaugh or pushing for a constitutional amendment on justices that limits how long they can serve seems more appropriate (and probably as likely when you consider how unlikely it will be to get more than 20 senators to vote in favor of packing even if we control the Senate and the White House.)You're correct. Even if Democrats win in 2020 and have something like 58 seats in the Senate at that point, any attempt at court packing would go down by a margin of like 85-15 and would probably never pass the Judiciary Committee.Shea getting Blac Chyna I COULD NOT BELIEVEIf you are on a crowded subway train and you do not take your backpack off, I should have the legal right to elbow it as hard as I can and break anything fragile inside.Seth Meyers said that the perfect episode of SNL is where you love a couple sketches, like a couple sketches and don't get a couple sketches.  It's a variety show, it's supposed to appeal to a variety of palettes!I don't trust people who say Halloween is their favorite "holiday".  You don't even get a day off work...OR SCHOOL.I have no problem with people decorating for Christmas early (as early as they want).  It doesn't harm anybody, and if this small thing makes people happy in this day and age then jeez, just let them have it.I'm proud of both my home senators Hirono and SchatzIt came out a little before the Kavanaugh vote and it’s a smaller scale, but Jason Van Dyke was found guilty for the murder of Laquan McDonald in 2014. He shot the 17-year-old 16 times as he was walking away, and he and other cops lied that Laquan attacked him. It’s a small show of justice that no one was sure would happen. Fuck Joe ManchinI get it’s a comedy show but I kind of wish they’d take those type of segments a little more seriously so people could actually learn something. Yeah Neal Brennan! I missed him, he's been gone too long :)Indiana: Tommy! He thanked me for Pence. If localized ads are the future of podcasts, I’m not sure how I feel about it...I agree sort of. Hoping they’ll talk about it more Wednesday. Lovett will be on and he brings it up more than Favs, Tommy and Dan combined. (Honestly more than all the Crooked pods combined.). I email them regularly asking for them to talk more about it. Obviously  I’m not speaking loudly enough. 

They literally didnt say anything about how she sounds shrill. She doesn't. It's not about what she sounds like, it's about what she says. And it's literally always outrage -even when its praise, its also brought up against the backdrop of outrage.

Her anger and denunciations are exhausting. Thank you! I totally agree. Theyre so lighthearted and fun, but Kara always seems to be mad about any small thing. Oh, an actor decided to act as something theyre not - trans, gay, whatever - here comes a four minute rant by Kara about how this is *literally* injustice. 

Even when she's happy, it's delivered angry.I’m well aware of the premise, hahaha :) But the other two hosts are just as capable of vicious takedowns without making “outraged indignation” one of three emotions in their repertoire. 

The last few months have been horrible for everyone. Those addicted to opioids aren’t getting help, refugees and immigrants are being abandoned by a society built by and for refugees and immigrants, students are being coerced into an unforgiving cycle of debt - no one has had it good, except those at the top. 

Women have seen progress, IMO. Abusers are being charged left and right. There’s never been a safer, more understanding time for a women to step forward and share her sexual assault experience. 

It’s also not about her anger a specific topic - it’s literally everything all the time. E-Scooters in San Francisco? Same indignation as Brett Kavanaughs testimony. She doesn’t have stages of anger, like Louis or Ira. Their outrage ranges from 1 to 10. Hers is either 1 or 10. Ah you know what, my instinctive defense here was “but I’m not a racist”. And that got me thinking: no, no that can’t be right. That’s not good reflection, that’s a shitty reflexive defense. So I deleted the comment and I’m trying again. 

There are other people I don’t listen to who have the same problem. Ben Shapiro, for one. Tried to pop my liberal echo chamber for some time, and I couldn’t stand him for long because of his voice. There’s also a lot of other male and female podcaster voices who I find grating. 

The idea of ranking favorite voices never crossed my mind, but if I did, I wonder if they’d all be white. If they are, is that because there’s more white podcasters, or because I’m predispositioned towards affinity to my own race? Why would it be limited to race? Why wouldn’t I also be attracted to German podcasters (I’m also German), or gay ones (bi)? 

So because I can’t quite figure out what I love in voices, I can take a look at what I dislike. Black women? Black men? Doubtful - God is literally a black man in pop culture (Morgan Freeman). Maybe that’s some peak “magical negro” trope nonsense, but black voices are iconic across the spectrum. 

You know who does piss me off? Shapiro, Laura Ingram, Dana Loesch, those people. The ones that rave and rant solo on the air. Fuck, Sean Hannity, and also that dude with the giant head on MSNBC. Like nails on a chalkboard. Thats the vibe Kara most resembles in my eyes. Having just listened to the new episode: maybe I’m giving her a little too much crap. She’s not always ‘on’. But she can really take an indignation and run with it. Which is satisfying and vindicating - it’s why I’ve been listening to the better part of the last 40 episodes. But it also gets excessive. 

Lovett is really good at running with indignation. The thing is, he is usually working a crowd as he does it. And he has this way of tumbling out of it on a punchline. He’s also very, very much into ribbing on himself, which gives him more license to be an ass, somehow. 

I think a closer resemblance is Bill Maher. Every time he starts yelling I just fast forward. Michael Moore, too. See comment above!Disagree - white men are not looked at well when they get angry. Nobody sees an angry Bill O’Reilly or Lindsey Graham and thinks, “yeah, yeah he can say what he wants without consequences, he’s so assertive”. That veneer is pulled down. And lots of black women, like Kamala Harris or Maxine Waters, are praised for the way they talk, and their anger. 

You think them media let Brett Kavanaugh’s yelling and hysteria slide? No, they took him to task for it. Granted, he shouldn’t ever have been confirmed, but his anger and yelling was not acceptable. 

Why does an entertainer have to be self-deprecating? I don’t know, it helps. It’s humbling and modest. It builds apathy with the audience, and shows vulnerability. Ira’s pretty self deprecating, and Louis is too. I don’t think Kara’s into that very much. I don’t think in your capacity as a reporter/journalist you’re exercising vulnerability. Having an opinion is not opening yourself up, it’s doing your job - paying your bills and putting food in your mouth. 

She doesn’t owe anyone anything, that’s certainly not what I believe. This is just my opinion on her performance. She isn’t self deprecating, she’s analytical and angry - it reminds me of every other abrasive pundit but with more topical references and progressive sensibilities. 

There’s *Handmaiden’s Tale* modesty and then there’s Tommy Vietor/Emily Bazelon modesty. I don’t think your race needs to be considered when it comes to modesty or self deprecation. It’s also not an expectation I hold of her. She’s a stranger, I don’t know her, she’s an opinion I listen to once a week for an hour and change. I’m evaluating her delivery as I would anyone else’s. And what am I supposed to do, evaluate her only against other black women, because white men have it easier? Hold her to a different standard? That’s silly, because I’m not holding her to any standard. I’ve identified a pattern of traits that hosts I find enjoyable embody, and she’s got too much and too little of my favorite traits. 

Also, saying *it’s the year that it is* as a justification for anything is... weird. What’s that’s about?

There’s literally hundreds of other dimensions to this woman that are influenced by or divorced from her race. American culture has a hard time internalizing intersectionality. Because of all the tribalism. That’s really thoughtful, thanks. You also raised an observation I hadn’t engaged with yet - the preemptive hate. They rush to judgement on so many things, and if they don’t get them, they’re swept aside. I’m foreign, and I feel this with literally any non-US item that enters their content. Maybe it’s because in their capacity as cultural analysts, they need to have an opinion on everything as it’s happening, or else they become less relevant/interesting. 

It’s definitely not her voice - she has really good cadence and timber. When she’s talking about something she cares about or affects her somehow, I’m right there with her. But I feel as though I’m seeing that less and less. I don’t know. What do my feelings matter? I’ll give it more thought and perspective. And if I remember correctly neither contestant got it right! I think a guest talked about DeRay too, forget the context. What the hell was that interview? It sounds like they toggled between Tommy/Lovett talking about her and then Sharice giving prerecorded statements. Then they talked together for a few seconds at the end?

Did I miss something?Nutella is way better on fruit than on bread. It’s not even a competition. Heidi Heitkamp's flawless switch to a thick North Dakota/Minnesota accent was just so wholesome.People on that sub love to troll on this one for starters.One interesting thing from the THR interview is that they don't receive any outside investment. There was some speculation on this subreddit that they got some venture capital money or something, but the article say they have different ways of revenue.So I wish Erin wouldn’t have opened with dropping a handful of fuck bombs in 30 seconds. I was going to recommend this to my grandparents but not sure I can with the first impression that’ll give them. I’m sure it’s the same with a lot of the older generations.  
  
Funny side note, I was watching at work and paused it when a customer came in. In Indiana, blue collar work, everybody is republican. He asked, “What’s p-o-d save America?”  
  
“It’s a podcast that got some specials on tv.”  
  
“Oh, conservative podcast I’m assuming?”  
  
Lied my ass off, “Not really, they just talk about issues without much slant either way.” Really hoping he doesn’t look it up. Yeah my grandfather is religious and they’re both kind of conservative. Not in a political way, but in a completely separated house duties, manners important, don’t like swearing kind of way.   
  
They’d be fine with the occasional swearing throughout, I just know that rapid fire at the very beginning would turn them off and have my gran saying “What is this filth flarn filth a_hendo told us to watch.” lol, I’ll probably recommend they watch next week if it doesn’t open with so much vulgarity. Not if he shits on the baby boomers again! But I think he learned his lesson. I don’t think the PSA appearances in themselves generate enough publicity to swing elections. Podcasting has come a long way but it’s still a relatively niche market, especially compared to video. Where I do think it could make a difference is in garnering volunteer help for candidates. I don’t have anything to back this up, but I’m assuming PSA listeners are a more active base than other mediums. So if a candidate is spotlighted in PSA, I could see it earning them more volunteers to help their campaign which could then help swing an election. What I said applies to primaries as well. They won’t swing a primary purely out of name recognition gained from coming on a show, but could from the volunteers and donations it could bring. I really like Debbie Mucarsel-Powell's interview. The environment should be a HUGE priority for literally everyone right now and I really like how knowledgeable and experienced she was on that front, *and* I liked how much they talked about it and how bad Curbelo is at handling it. I like Ben Rhodes, but if you took a drink every time he said "yeah", you would have died about 2 minutes in.The series proposed Medicare for All, criminal justice reform, and a choice between a UBI or a Job Guarantee (depending on which you think is best). It also stressed having candidates from all demographics and walks of life to ensure that Democratic candidates can empathize with voters. That’s just off the top of my head, but I think those things are all messages that are good enough to promote voting. Lot of both sidism that is so unhelpful and just wrong. “Neither side is raising people’s wages.” Democrats at the state level have implemented a $15 minimum wage. “Neither side is taking meaningful action on climate change.” Um, Obama. It is not right. Just because something doesn’t go far enough doesn’t mean it’s not meaningful. Being in the Paris agreement is meaningful. First steps no matter how small mean something. You have to walk before you run. What you’re saying is if you can’t run, walking is meaningless. Well when the alternative is sitting on your ass, walking means a whole lot. I think both need to be addressed. Surviving climate change is going to require a holistic approach. I think this nuance is important and is something that politicians are not enunciating well. Having almost every country acknowledge that climate change is a big enough issue to warrant an international agreement is meaningless? The latest UN report on climate change was meaningless? New limits on carbon pollution don’t matter? If you think the clean air act was meaningless you must have no issues with the Trump admin rolling it back? Why is Beto chaperoning his nephew Lovett to his first rock concert? “This person is only pushing me uphill with one of their hands so they’re just as bad as the person kicking me back downhill.”You seemed to be defending the “both sides are the same” argument. Has this not been working for anybody else? Says it can’t find my email address, it’s the same one I pledged to vote with. Holy shit of course lolAs far as the main show, there was a live episode early on with Erin Ryan (I *think* it's the one where she starts the 'Paul Ryan is my dad' joke), and it's basically right when the Donald Trump Jr. emails come out that show he was in on it, and everyone had a field day just roasting the Trump sons.

As far as non-PSA shows, the *Lovett or Leave it* with Kumail Nanjiani and Lauren Lapkus was the best. I maintain that every guest on LOLI needs to be a comedian, because the show is way funnier.On tv he made fun of the idea that Democrats are organizing the caravan by saying something like, "It's crazy to think Democrats are organizing in Honduras when they couldn't even organize in Pennsylvania!"

PA Democratic party was like, "challenge accepted".Chris should be a PSA guest at some point. He fits in perfectly with their vibe.I think the most upsetting news in this email (among the many awful stories obvs) is that Justin Bieber burrito story. Holy moly.Ronan liked it too!I love how Emily Heller's rant wheel topics are always so incredibly random and out there. Chicken costumes, shark stealing, spider mondo-webs! She gets the assignment.Regardless of whether a blue wave happens, the amount of women in Congress will increase.
