state attorneys general and yes that is
the correct plural and if you already
knew that I'm sorry that high school was
such a rough time for you believe me I
know being a teenage grammar nerd is
something from which it is difficult to
recover and look I do realize that they
show about state AG's sounds like a
tedious prospect just watch the start of
this 2006 panel discussion on c-span in
front of an electrified crowd our panel
today features three distinguished and
very very different and bipartisan
attorneys general I gotta say that was a
bit of a dick move by the c-span camera
man there he didn't have to pan across
those empty seats but he did it anyway
as if to say look even the panel's
friends didn't show up and I'll tell you
what that panel did wrong actually if
you want a live audience to listen to
you talk about state AG's simply don't
tell them in advance we filmed this show
in front of a live audience
you think we told them what this shows
about of course not they were explicitly
told that this was a taping of the
Rachael Ray Show and I promise she'll be
out any minute now but look it is worth
the effort to learn about state AG's
because they are very important and yet
most of us probably don't know who ours
is although if you live in Indiana I am
very excited to introduce you to yours
please meet Curtis Hill AG by day
although by night something very much
different I was toying around with it
and discovered that I sounded sorta like
Elvis we're caught in a trap I can't
walk out
because I love you too much baby
we saw the Attorney General do all the
hits I don't know if you've noticed but
I don't look much like Elvis to be
honest I'd noticed that frankly it's
difficult to notice anything besides the
most sadistic inseam in the history of
tailoring that looks like a marshmallow
bisected with fishing wire and that's
all it looks like most ladies are
actually elected meaning they belong to
political parties and they run campaign
ads like this striking one from Michigan
when you're choosing Michigan's next
Attorney General ask yourself this who
can you trust most not to show you their
penis in a professional setting is that
the candidate who doesn't have a penis
I'd say so well certainly and arguments
although to be honest if you asking me
which candidate I trust most not to show
me their penis I'd have to go with
 Dennis he he can't show me his
penis why that mean old raccoon still
has it that woman is running for
attorney general in Michigan it's one of
30 states where voters will be selecting
their next AG on November 6th and those
elections are going to be unusually
competitive some estimate that more than
a hundred million dollars will be spent
on AG races this year that's up to three
times more than ever before so tonight
let's look at who AG's are what they do
and why they matter and let's start with
what they do because typically they
serve as a state's chief legal officer
and the people's loyal with
responsibilities ranging from a criminal
law enforcement to consumer advocacy to
and everything in between
the landmark multi-billion dollar
tobacco industry settlement in the 90s
the one that killed Joe Camel that was
thanks to state AG's this year's
blockbuster report on abuses by the
Catholic Church in Pennsylvania that was
thanks to a state AG you know who put
out that raging wildfire in Northern
California that was firefighters use
your head
why would state AG's have been involved
in that use your instincts here
the fact is the fact is though AG's
often work on politically neutral
matters and they still do but in recent
decades they've also become
significantly more partisan one small
sign of this is that while all AG's
belong to the National Association of
attorneys general or nag around two
decades ago Republicans formed a
separate committee just for them raga
and the Democrats followed suit with
dagger and I do know that rocket and
dagger sound like twins from Dutch
folklore that teach children about right
and wrong
Rocka always milks the cow when its
udders are swollen but darker is off
making nonsense with a goose when darker
is given no dinner
this is justice but arguably the most
high-profile way in which this job has
become more partisan is the extent to
which a GS belonging to one party have
teamed up to bring lawsuits against the
federal government now that used to be
relatively rare but starting in the
Obama years the number of those sort of
lawsuits skyrocketed it was Republican
AG's who successfully limited the
Medicaid expansion of Obamacare and
suing the government became a point of
pride for AG's like Texas's Greg Abbott
what I do is I go into the office I sue
the federal government and then I go
home
I've sued the Obama administration now
25 times over the last four years yeah
but that is not the smirk of a guy who
just goes into the office sues the
government and goes home is it that's
the smoke of a guy who goes into the
office sues the government adjust the
office thermostat without telling anyone
steal someone's sandwich from the fridge
farts in the elevator and then goes home
now Apple has since gone on to become
governor of Texas but his successor Ken
Paxton was no less eager to sue the
Obama administration just listened to
his wife proudly describing Paxton's
love for lawsuits in what apparently I
legally have to call a song I'm a
pistol-packing mama yes I
I'm a pistol-packing mama
Esaias I'm a pistol-packing mama and my
husband sues Obama again I never thought
I would say this but I would honestly
rather listen to moose knuckle Elvis
Shirley Temple get up in his living room
in a too-tight onesie now
Paxton himself is actually a really good
example of how a state AG's political
views can significantly impact their
work
he told County Clerk's that they could
refuse to issue marriage licenses to
same-sex couples he was a lead plaintiff
in a lawsuit that shot down an Obama era
rule that would have made four million
people eligible for overtime pay and
when the Obama administration tried to
extend protections for transgender kids
in public schools
Paxton sued and said this any man that
decides that they wanted to clear
themselves to be female for the day can
walk into your daughter's locker room or
bathroom it now opens the door for
anybody no matter what they are and how
they're thinking they can change their
gender for a day and have the ability to
walk into a women's locker room it's
just not right what the are you
talking about obvious bigotry aside
transgender people don't just switch
identity for convenience they are human
beings not read frogs that's right read
frogs
should the need arise can spontaneously
change from female to male I just hit
you with an unexpected frog fact in the
middle of talking about state attorneys
general I know what you're thinking
where the is Rachael Ray
in the next village I'm gonna write just
be patient be patient
she'll be here she's making frittatas
and you're all going to have a taste
now should be here just be patient
now now now Paxton has actually spent
almost his entire time in office under
indictment and is awaiting trial for
securities fraud but that is not evenly
ken Paxton related allegation I would
like to show you instead I'd like to
focus on one mentioned in a real attack
ad from his current opponent this is the
collin county courthouse where a dallas
attorney accidentally left a $1,000 pen
at the metal detectors this is Ken
Paxton the indicted Texas Attorney
General rummaging through the metal
detector trays and stealing that $1,000
pen and this is Ken Paxton the indicted
Texas Attorney General walking away with
a stolen pen vote Justin Nelson for
Texas Attorney General he will fight on
behalf of all Texans and he won't steal
no pain yes that's a relief although
thanks to that ad earlier I would also
like to know that he won't steal my pen
or show me his penis or for that matter
shown me his pen or steal my penis I
wouldn't need to know all his positions
on the penis pen show-steal continuum
still the larger point is state AG's are
increasingly partisan and when you look
at how ken Paxton has used his power it
is hard not to think that that is a bad
thing but partisanship can cut both ways
and now that Trump is in office
democratic state AG's are the ones
filing lawsuits against the president
and while you may have been unhappy to
hear people cheer for that
pistol-packing mama as husband suing
Obama I suspect it may feel a little
different hearing the Democratic AG of
Washington state say this we have 19
since the donald trump became president
we've filed 19 lawsuits against
administration so what do you say to
people who just think you have an axe to
grind against this guy why I plead
guilty
[Laughter]
you see it's interesting how your
feelings on soon the government can
change a lot based on who is saying it
it's like how I'm getting off here is a
fine thing for someone to say if they're
standing next to the door of a train but
a very rude thing to say if they are
masturbating on that same train
so look state AG's have a lot of power
and while many of us may not have been
aware of that corporations and other
special interests certainly have because
both rocker and dagger have been
increasingly aggressive about raising
funds and one way they do that is by
organizing events where they essentially
sell access to AG's ragga
especially has some pretty lavish
getaways where industries can mingle
with the AG's who are supposed to be
policing them as CPS found when its part
on one in South Carolina we saw at least
nine state AG's rubbing shoulders with
representatives from Koch Industries Big
Tobacco payday lenders and the NRA the
dress code resort casual CBS News
reviewed 88 donations over $50,000 and
found more than half of the donors had
matters under consideration by a state
attorney general or had recently settled
now rocker says there is absolutely no
quid pro quo there so I guess those
groups simply donated substantial
amounts of money because they wanted to
chillax to the max at a resort casual
clambake with North Dakota Attorney
General Wayne Stenehjem oh yeah he's not
just the AG of North Dakota he's the
 mayor of margarita blue Wayne
parties hard he's an animal and
look some state AG's have been
ridiculously cozy with corporations take
scott pruett former head of the EPA he
previously served as Oklahoma's AG where
he had a very close relationship with
energy companies he sued the EPA 14
times and wrote the agency multiple
letters about policies that threatened
to impact local oil companies like Devon
Energy but when a reporter obtained
copies of Pruitt's correspondence with
Devon he noticed a weird coincidence the
letters that scott pruett had written
were identical copies in most cases of
draft letters that Devon had sent him he
had taken those letters and simply put
him on a stationery and sentiment as if
they were essentially the state law
enforcement official opinion it was like
holy exactly like he said holy
and that sure looks like Pruitt let an
oil company do his work for him although
to be fair maybe he just happened to
think up the exact same words in the
exact same order that they did maybe you
find that plausible personally I find it
about as plausible as I do the idea that
the family in a quiet place stayed
silent for 472 days Wow no one thought
Eid for more than a year that could
really be the title of the movie because
that is genuinely incredible so so state
AG's are powerful increasingly partisan
and over half of them are on the ballot
this year and Republicans are very much
ready for this fight as Arkansas state
AG and chair of raga Leslie Rutledge
will tell you when it comes to the
Democratic AG's I can't speak to what
they do I know they raise a heck of a
lot less money than the Republican AG's
do because we have been crushing it ok
so first again a bit of a dick move by
the c-span Caravan they're undercutting
her claims of crushing it with a cruel
cut away to her audience candy crushing
it but the fact is she is right Raja is
really out raising dark and it seems
they are now locked in an arms race for
funds which just cannot be the
healthiest way for this system to
operate naughty raga naughty dagger if
you keep keep behaving like that your
parents will tell you to de see which
like your sisters
now interestingly Rutledge is one of the
AG's up for election on November 6th as
is possible pen thief Ken Paxton and if
you live in any of these highlighted
States you have got an Ag race to vote
for and it is really worth taking a few
minutes to research the candidates
especially because many people who do
actually vote end up leaving the AG box
on the ballot empty so your vote for Ag
may technically be even more valuable in
Texas one poll showed that 39% of
registered voters didn't name who that
they would vote for for Ag because they
and I quote haven't thought enough about
it which sounds terrible but that's
actually a cause for genuine hope
because remember that is where Ken
Paxton is running and if there is one
thing sure to damage Ken Paxton's
reputation it's an awareness of Ken
Paxton's reputation so so please before
November 6th just think about your AG
race you can do it you've got nine days
left and I know that we've all been
asked to think about a lot this year
from Supreme Court nominations to gun
control to the energy of Pete Davidson's
penis it's it's been a lot and now I am
adding research your state AG race to
your list but it is honestly worth it
also if you do it you'll frankly be
amazed at the kind of tidbits that you
might find if you live in Wisconsin just
google Brad Schimel $10,000 coins and
you'll learn about how your AG managed
to spend ten grand of taxpayer money on
coins reading K AE D which stands for
his actual personal motto kicking ass
every day if you live in Arkansas Google
Leslie Rutledge karaoke 2016 so you can
see our friend from before absolutely
crushing it on stage
[Music]
wait did that guy just say sing it
Leslie I'm not sure that's encouragement
I think that might be an honest plea
sing it Leslie sing it
don't just drone it a rhythmically and
an inconsistent volume the bands in E
major and you're in H try and bring it
into the known musical universe Leslie
and look if you're in Michigan and even
if you are not please google Bill
Schuette e 1989 video here's their
current AG but he's not actually up for
election because he's running for
governor but it is still worth googling
that so you can watch him creepily
hitting on a woman behind the camera I
would be happy to move closer to the
land anything some things that may not
let you run the camera on admire your
tenacity appreciate your spirit of
Vincent van Gogh
Rembrandt Toulouse Lautrec oh that is
rough to watch I don't know how she got
through the interview without punching
him in the dick
but point here is a point here is taking
just two minutes to research your state
AG is a valuable use of your time and if
you are thinking that you don't have two
minutes you actually do because it's
11:28 right now I'm not saying goodbye
until 11:30 so go to vote for one one
org right now where you can find out if
there is an election in your state and
if so who your AG candidates are
seriously do it now you will not be
missing anything
I promise nothing entertaining is going
to happen for the rest of this show in
fact to help drive you away for the rest
of the broadcast a bagpiper will be
playing Leslie Rutledge's favorite song
she thinks my tractor's sexy take it
away
[Music]
yes
believe it or not these bagpipes make
this song even more unlistenable than it
already is
that is an ungodly noise no disrespect
turn this show off now and research your
AG and if you haven't already been
repelled into action I'll happily add an
accordion into the mix oh yes the sweet
sweet sound of a bagpipe are called into
x2 sounds that come together
what pop-tarts and fish gum two bunks
for what one.org
right now because I promise this just
isn't gonna get any better and don't
 push me on this mentally sound
think again don't join me
should be watching this show anymore
[Music]
coming tonight
[Applause]
that we're never going to pay for
charters
[Applause]
how are you somehow the worst
ingredients in all this
any Jews because these guys are about to
get loud
[Music]
saudi arabia
birthplace of the prophet muhammad the
prophet muhammad
our graphics department must have
decided against that one for some reason
now
saudi arabia has been in the news this
week for a truly appalling reason
and it has to do with saudi journalist
jamal khashoggi a u.s resident and
columnist for the washington post who
has not been seen since he stepped to
the saudi consulate in turkey to pick up
some paperwork
12 days ago this is captured on closed
circuit cameras stepping into what
turkish authorities believe
was a death trap turkish authorities
have identified 15 saudi men as persons
of interest
only hours before khashoggi went missing
several of them were caught on camera
arriving in istanbul a turkish official
tells the new york times saudi agents
had dismembered his body with a bone saw
they brought for the purpose
it's absolutely horrific and the saudis
deny it happened although
let us all agree on this a bone saw in
any context
is an immediate red flag thanks so much
for inviting me over for thanksgiving
craig the turkey's delicious
the stuffing is perfect that's a very
large bum sauce and i just remembered i
have to leave now
now saudi officials have scrambled to
explain all the suspicious activities
surrounding his disappearance with the
saudi-owned channel al-arabiya
claiming that the 15 people who turned
up in istanbul
were just tourists which is clearly
given that flight logs showed that most
of the men arrived on a private charter
plane at 3 13
am and that all of them departed the
same day they arrived which is a pretty
weird
vacation isn't it i want to see istanbul
but only for a few hours
mostly at night and i need to bring my
bonesaw
also the whole we were just tourist
excuse isn't even a new one
in the wake of russia's poisoning of
sergey sripal the russian suspects tried
the same thing
what were you doing there our friends
had been suggesting for a long time that
we visit this wonderful town
salisbury a wonderful town
yes
there's the famous salisbury cathedral
famous not only in europe but in the
whole world
it's famous for its 123 meter spire
it's famous for its clock the one of the
first ever created in the world that's
still working
okay so first i love how the reporter
immediately became suspicious when they
called salisbury
a wonderful town she knows what's up
it's like if you heard someone call
celery a delicious treat
look i don't know what else you're not
telling the truth about but now i
definitely know you're a liar
and second it's famous for its 123 meter
spire
they sound like they're reading directly
off the wikipedia page for salisbury
oh why do i love salisbury it's simple
the population is 40
302 and their member of parliament is
john glenn a conservative
whose eight year tenure has been widely
viewed as a failure
open brackets citation needed close
brackets
but look look for all the saudis in
denials
things are not looking good right now as
the turkish government reportedly have
audio and video proof
of the assassination look this story is
incredibly grim
because while this may be the first that
you have heard of jamal khashoggi
he's long been a significant figure in
saudi arabia a thoughtful
and by no means radical critic of the
saudi royal family and this is all
worrying
because the only reason to kill a
journalist in your own consulate
with 15 people and a bone saw you flew
in that day it's because you wanted to
send a message
and you were sure you could get away
with it which raises the question
why would they be so sure of that and
part of that answer may have to do with
us so tonight let's take a look at
america's relationship with saudi arabia
because we have a long and morally
compromised history in short in very
short for decades
we have had a relationship based on
strategic interests not
shared values they have oil we need it
they opposed iran
and so did we and for those and other
reasons u.s presidents have to varying
degrees
been willing to pander to saudi arabia
and in doing so we've conveniently
turned a blind eye to a lot of things
from human rights abuses to the saudi
leadership's role in funding religious
extremism
even while partnering with us to fight
it it's always been
a very complicated relationship but in
the last couple of years it's actually
gotten significantly closer
thanks to two new leaders trump and
crown prince mohammed bin salman
and let's take the prince first though
his father the king
is still alive since last year the
prince has effectively been running the
country and has branded himself as
mbs the young new face of saudi arabia
he made the cover of time magazine under
the headline charm offensive
and 60 minutes profiled him as a
progressive voice for the country
his reforms inside saudi arabia have
been revolutionary
he is emancipating women introducing
music in cinema
and cracking down on corruption now
there is some truth to that
he's attempted to reduce the influence
of some hardline clerics uh he has
agreed to let women drive
and he's allowed movie theaters after a
35-year ban although i will note that
one of the very first movies they showed
there was
and this is true the emoji movie which
in hindsight is actually how it was
always supposed to be seen by a group of
people who had never seen a good movie
to compare it to
now now all of that has been combined
with a major plan to reorient
the saudi economy away from oil and
toward technology called vision 2030.
to that end mbs has gone on a world tour
this year to reassure investors that
saudi arabia is stable
and progressive and that businesses
should feel comfortable working with
them he's taken meetings with tim cook
bill gates and richard branson and has
even had starbucks with michael
bloomberg
incidentally while the starbucks
baristas miraculously nailed mohammed
bin salman
bloomberg still ended up with a cup
reading mikey boomberg
now as part of
his pr push mbs started an annual
business conference called
the future investment initiative or as
it's known davos in the desert
the first one was held just last year at
the ritz carlton in riyadh featuring
leaders
of many big name companies as well as
the usual futuristic tech like
this
we have smart investors here and they
are very selective
about what they invest in well
i think i'm special i can use my
expressive face to communicate with
people
but why is it important for you to have
an expressive most of the time i feel
positive
god oh god that is a creepy smile
that's the exact same smile that i've
seen the queen give when she has to
interact with a commoner
oh i believe you won some kind of
contest to come to my house and look at
my things
what a positive day for one of us
don't touch anything
but mbs's pr push isn't just toward
attracting businesses it's also toward
changing the world's perception of saudi
arabia to that end he struck a 10-year
deal
with one of the most popular and most
american franchises there is
world wrestling entertainment or wwe
they held their first of many events
there
back in april and audiences around the
world were treated to water war
propaganda
about the new saudi arabia including a
video showing women happily driving
men dancing and tourist destination
beauty shots as well as
constant excited compliments throughout
the broadcast for the first time
wwe bringing an event of this magnitude
to saudi arabia this vibrant progressive
city
our host tonight it's all part of course
of the saudi vision
2030 king abdullah city stadium just got
on its feet that area has been reserved
for the
saudi royal family the house of assad i
want to send a genuine thank you
to the kingdom of saudi arabia wow
it seems the wwe is overtly pro-saudi
arabia
as it is blatantly homoerotic which is
to say
intensely
but the truth is mbs is far from the
political reformer that he's been
presented as in fact
scratch any positive story about him and
you will find a much grimmer truth
underneath
for instance while the country did get
headlines for ending its ban on women
driving
just weeks before authorities arrested
about a dozen female activists
who'd campaigned for the right to drive
even that investment conference had a
dark code because just one week later
at the exact same hotel this happened
new footage from inside the ritz-carlton
hotel
in saudi arabia's capital riyadh shows a
dramatic transformation
from a favorite haunt of the well-heeled
into arguably the world's most luxurious
prison
it's true mbs used that ritz carlton to
lock up hundreds of businessmen and
members of the royal family in a
so-called anti-corruption campaign
at least 17 detainees were reportedly
hospitalized for physical abuse
and one saudi military officer died in
custody which is obviously insane and
horrifying
because the only hotel where you expect
to be murdered is a days inn
hence their slogan days in expect to be
murdered here
meanwhile bin salman has been aggressive
with his neighbours launching a blockade
of qatar last year that continues to
this day
as does an absolutely brutal war in
yemen that has resulted in over 16 000
casualties
and killed over 1200 children the saudi
campaign of air strikes has been
catastrophic as this man attested while
standing in front of what used to be is
hung
saudi arabia bombs without care how many
of your family were killed
27 lives 27 people
from one family can you think of any
reason why
your family and this house might have
been struck i am not a leader or
anything i work as a barber
i that's clearly terrible and for the
record at the very least
there is no justification for violence
against a barber
and that is coming from me if anyone
has a justification for a blood grudge
against barbers
it would be yours truly because of what
they did to me
and yet and yet
as all of this has happened our current
president has continued to bend over
backwards to accommodate
and ignore bin salman's worst excesses
and sometimes
even celebrate them after that clampdown
on corruption at the ritz carlton
many around the world sounded the alarm
but trump went the other way
trump endorsed crown prince mohammed bin
salman's new corruption crackdown
tweeting quote
i have great confidence in king salman
and the crown prince of saudi arabia
they know exactly what they are doing
right
but just because they know what they're
doing doesn't mean that what they're
doing
is good michael jordan knew exactly what
he was doing when he wore this mustache
in a haines commercial
he was seeing how far this whole michael
jordan thing could take him and the
answer was apparently
through hitler and beyond
and that that actually fits with the
larger pattern of donald trump and saudi
arabia because since taking office he
has catered
cater to them at every single turn he
made saudi arabia the first foreign
country he visited
as president and he seemed to have an
absolutely great time there dancing with
a sword
and famously groping a weird glowing orb
after which i assume michael cohen
instinctively offered the orb 130 000
and told it to keep quiet and look it
really shouldn't be that surprising to
anybody
that trump has so enthusiastically
embraced the saudi royal family they
have the two qualities he admires most
in the world
having a lot of money and giving it to
him he basically said as much on the
campaign trail
saudi arabia and i get along great with
all of them they buy apartments from me
they spend 40 million 50 million am i
supposed to dislike them i like them
very much
yeah of course buying an apartment from
trump is a sure-fire way to get him to
like you along with
wearing one of his hats being under 25
years old with a size 32 double d
and not being eric he's a he's a simple
man
with simple tastes and trump's
businessman view of the saudis is just
people with money don't ask too many
questions
has carried over now that he's president
when bin salman came to the white house
trump called a press conference in the
oval office where he boasted
about the amount of arms that they were
buying from us essentially using mbs as
a human easel some of the things that
have been approved and are currently
under construction and will be delivered
to saudi arabia very soon and that's for
their protection but if you look
in terms of dollars three billion
dollars
533 million dollars
525 million dollars
that's peanuts for you you've increased
it 880 million dollars
645 million dollars six billion dollars
that's
uh for frigates
first first has any human in the history
of the world more obviously just learned
a word than he just learned the word
frigates
frigates but second look at bin salman's
face there as it hits him
just how much trump likes money it's
like the face of a babysitter who
realized you can pacify a screaming kid
with twizzlers oh i thought this was
going to be difficult
but if all you want is twizzlers i've
got loads of them here take all you want
and shut the up
and look look i am by no means saying
that trump is the first u.s president to
make distasteful arms deals with the
saudis
we've been doing it for decades the
obama administration
still sold them weapons even as saudi
arabia got involved in yemen but trump
has continued doing so even a signed
amount of saudi recklessness in
airstrikes two months ago they dropped
an american-made bomb
on a school bus full of children but
just a month later
trump's defense secretary said that
saudi arabia was doing everything it
could
to prevent civilian casualties and we
carried on supporting them my point here
is
at every turn trump has gone out of his
way to accommodate the saudis
he doesn't even have an ambassador to
the kingdom our relationship with them
is being handled personally
by jared ivanka trump's real doll
and and the saudis seem understandably
very happy with that situation
kushner took an unannounced trip to
saudi arabia in 2017 to meet with the
young prince
months later mbs reportedly boasted that
kushner was quote
in his pocket which bin salman denied
yeah
of course he's in their pocket he's
 jared
that face was born to be maneuvered into
someone's pocket his secret service
nickname is probably wallet keys and a
little bit of lint
so so while the fact that the us has
enabled saudi arabia
is nothing new the extent to which trump
is prioritizing money above all else is
really dangerous
is it any wonder that they have been
emboldened here after mbs's roundup of
his rivals
trump tweeted his support after his
blockade of qatar trump for some reason
took credit for it and that kind of
has consequences
time and again trump has chosen extreme
friendliness with
mbs a leader who in the words of one
saudi critic has created
a climate of fear and intimidation going
on to say
we saudis deserve better that critic
was jamal khashoggi the journalist who
is widely thought to have been murdered
in the saudi consulate
and while trump has said that saudi
arabia faces severe punishment
if it's proven they were behind this
does anyone really believe
that that is something that he's
honestly committed to a much more
revealing response came in the oval
office
after the news of khashoggi's
disappearance broke just watch him
render in real time the cost-benefit
analysis that he was applying to the
situation
again this took place in turkey and to
the best of our knowledge
khashoggi is not a united states citizen
is that right or
is that right he's a permanent resident
okay we don't like it
john we don't like it and we don't like
it even a little bit
but as to whether or not we should stop
110 billion dollars from being spent in
this country
Brazil home of that one famous statue
that I don't know the name of because
I'm too embarrassed to Google come at me
bro Jesus statue we we tend to think of
Brazil as being synonymous with soccer
beaches and of course the Rio Carnival
the exuberant celebration that has
inspired breathless newsreel reports
since the 1930s down in Rio they're
turning night into day it's the final
day of the big carnival and a mere
couple of million karaokes Brazilians -
you are out on a great whoopi yes those
fan seeking Carioca at having themselves
a great whoopie what an excitable group
of people they are what a fun punch now
I will be the first with me it's the
tone of British news newsreels in the
past he's breathtakingly condescending
although before you get too judgmental
you might want to see an American one
from the same era Brazil itself is
larger than the whole of the United
States and it has millions of acres of
land that no white man has ever seen
oh that basic geography lesson just took
a pretty racist turn the point is none
of us have our hands clean anyway the
reason the reason that I want to talk
about Brazil tonight is that they had a
massive election today the first of two
rounds of voting to elect among other
things a new president and what results
are coming in as we speak it is worth
talking about it for a number of reasons
first a Brazilian politics can be a lot
of fun as we've mentioned before
broadcasters have to provide free
airtime to political parties and some
candidates use that airtime to really
 around over the years they've been
ads for a guy dressed as a grasshopper a
dancing chicken a small elderly version
of Robin a surprisingly healthy-looking
asama bin Laden
Captain America a husky spider-man and
my favorite Geraldo Wolverine
now I know what you're thinking if
Hillary adjust on that things would have
been a lot different well maybe maybe
maybe but the point we'll never know
will we
we'll never know this election has been
crazy for reasons that go well beyond
novelty Wolverines and if you're
thinking why should I care about it well
first that's a pretty hostile way to put
it but second Brazil is home to 200
million people it's the fifth largest
country on Earth and they could be on
the brink of massive change but his
Brazilians are pissed off right now one
recent survey found that 95% of them say
their countries headed in the wrong
direction as you will see tonight there
is a very real chance that they're about
to elect a dangerous ideologue with
potentially disastrous consequences so
let us look at why that is the case and
the first thing that you really need to
understand is that Brazil is just
emerging from the worst recession in its
history millions are out of work and in
some regions crime is out of control
last year there were more than 63,000
homicides in Brazil that's more than
Europe and the United States combined
and if you live in Rio
you're probably acutely aware of that
fact turreted percent of the citizen
that lives the real was in a middle of a
crossfire once in the last year 30% were
in the middle of crossfire at that point
Rio's Weather Channel should probably
include crossfire in their forecasts
today's looking partly cloudy with a 30
percent charge about hailstorm of
bullets so maybe bring a light flak
jacket with you and the general
dissatisfaction about crime has been
exacerbated by a gigantic corruption
scandal arising from the investigation
known as Operation car wash and I
realize that that doesn't sound like the
name of a major investigation it sounds
like a Netflix original comedy starring
Kevin James that for some reason you'll
be recommended because you watched one
episode of chef's table I don't know I
don't know what your algorithm is
Netflix but I hate it
now now operation carwash and the
scandal uncovered by it is way too
complicated to get into now suffice to
say that it involves this gas station
these two companies inflated contracts
bribes and kickbacks to government
officials and an elderly gentleman who
flew around the world with bricks of
cash shrink-wrapped
and straps beneath thigh-high socks and
a Spanx like vest which really explains
this year's hottest Halloween costume
sexy carwash co-conspirator and look the
sheer scale of this scandal is
absolutely mind-blowing as the elite
prosecutor will tell you how does
carwash compare to Watergate carwash is
much much bigger bigger than Watergate
much bigger we already have charged more
than two hundred people for hundreds of
crimes the amounts of bribes paid go up
to about two billion dollars billion
dollars and bigger than Watergate
Richard Nixon must be spinning in his
grave right now oh wait a second pull
out a bit no he's escaped again he's
done it again god damn it tricky dick
you're so tricky yes so tricky
operated carwash has rocked Brazilians
faith in their government to its very
core and the people there are
understandably disillusioned I think
Brazil is heading towards complete chaos
that is my impression politicians are
not governing it's a complete mess I'm
going to cast a blank ballot because we
don't know who to vote for anymore we
put ourselves in this situation the
country of the future is the country of
misery the country of misery that's just
not a phrase you expect to come out of
Brazil
it's afraid to expect to be the official
tourism slogan of Great Britain come to
read me we promise there will be no
great whoopee so whose job will it be to
try and turn things around in Brazil
well the most popular politician in
Brazil by far is this guy former
President Luiz inácio Lula da Silva he's
beloved for presiding over a period of
prosperity there in which social
programs were expanded and millions were
lifted out of poverty he was actually
running to retake his office and was
projected to win easily there was just
one
issue one of brazil's most influential
political figures is now in police
custody former Brazilian President Luiz
Lula da Silva turned himself in on
Saturday to serve a 12 year sentence for
corruption yep Lula was caught up in
operation car wash - and he claims that
the charges against him were politically
motivated and many supporters believe
him in fact he's still so popular the
polls showed he would have won the
election if he'd been allowed to run
from prison which kind of makes sense
because electing a president who is
already in prison for corruption does
save you this seemingly inevitable
hassle of having to put your president
in prison for corruption it's a time
saver if nothing else
now since Lula is out his party is
running Fernando Haddad in his place
he's the former mayor of Sao Paulo and
he's generally little known him in the
rest of Brazil and instead of trying to
build up a brand of his own daddys
desperately trying to play up his
similarity to Lula in a series of
campaign ads it's subtle but just see if
you can catch it that is just an insult
to people's intelligence you can't just
spin a sign and make people forget which
guy is which I can't make you mix up
Gary Busey and Lucille Ball by spinning
a sign and going goosey loosey goosey
loosey goosey loosey goosey loosey
goosey loosey why because you will still
know which one is America's Sweetheart
and which was married to Desi Arnaz now
the fact is the fact is a dad has his
work cut out for him here because not
only is he not Lula their party the
Workers Party or PT has been heavily
tainted by recent scandals and many
Brazilians are eager for a radical
change and that brings us to the man
currently leading in the polls
Jaya volson ro and the nicest thing that
you can say for him is he has not been
implicated in a corruption investigation
yet unfortunately that's literally the
only nice thing that I can possibly find
to say about him because he is a
terrible human being for a start he's a
big fan of doing finger guns
seriously he does this all the
time there is even video of him teaching
a little girl how to do them for some
reason
and look liking finger guns as far as
I'm concerned is an immediate character
flaw it puts him in the August company
of Michael Scott's children pretending
to be Cowboys and that co-worker who
says things like working hard or hardly
working that everybody hates
unfortunately it only gets worse from
there a member of the Brazilian Congress
since 1991 and known for his sometimes
racist misogynistic homophobic and even
undemocratic views bolson arrow has
passed himself as a political outsider
offensive for most it is his outspoken
nature that has many saying he's
Brazil's version of Donald Trump it's
true he's become known there as the
Brazilian Trump which is both
politically worrisome and also the
grossest style to order and a pubic hair
salon I'll take the up Brazilian Trump
please it's what you rip everything off
the front area but you come some ass
hair around to give the illusion of hair
that's what it is I'm not showing you
that you're imagining it that's in your
head don't be angry with me be angry
with yourself
now unfortunately boss Nara has fired up
many young people in Brazil particularly
from the middle and upper classes there
are some incredible videos online of him
turning up to airports only to be mobbed
by a crowd lifting him onto their
shoulders and chanting for him it is
some intense support and it's worrying
that young people are so excited by him
because he is an extreme hard right
conservative he wants to withdraw Brazil
from the Paris agreement on climate
change and weaken environmental
regulations
he's called refugees arriving in Brazil
the scum of the world and as for crime
he wants to make it easier for
Brazilians to buy guns presumably so
they can fight it themselves but he also
favors some psychotically strong law
enforcement saying a policeman who
doesn't kill isn't a policeman which
incredibly still isn't even in the top
10 most alarming statements that he's
made and some way that he'd actually go
much further
Boston aura has said in the past I am in
favor of a dictatorship which is
particularly worried
as he's a former military captain in a
country that until 1985 was ruled by a
brutal military dictatorship and while
that regime engaged in torture and
extrajudicial killings balsa Morrow has
said that that mistake was that they
simply didn't go far enough I'm in favor
of torture you know that and the people
are too through the vote you won't
change anything in this country nothing
absolutely nothing it's only going to
change unfortunately when we get to a
civil war doing the job that the
military regime didn't do killing 30,000
Wow
he's pretty jarring to hear someone
claim that a military dictatorship
didn't kill enough people he's like
saying Hugh Hefner didn't enough in
the last days of his life really really
because I'm pretty sure the amount he
did it was already a human rights abuse
and regarding Boston arrows famous
homophobia and misogyny it really has to
be seen to be believed
first take a look at how he won't spoke
to a female member of Congress I would
never rape you because you're not worth
it I hope not because I'd slap you in
the face do it I'll slap you back do it
I'll slap you back do it I'll slap you
back what's this are you pushing me do
it I'll slap you back holy he
starts he starts there with I'd never
rape you because you're not worth it and
then somehow manages to top that
terrible statement
that's like saying sorry kids Christmas
is canceled this year why because I've
murdered Santa Claus and both stars
homophobia if any if anything is
actually even worse because in interview
after interview he has said some more
horrifying things he cackles they throw
6 fresco they want to reach our children
in order to turn the children into gay
adults to satisfy their sexuality in the
future if your child starts to become
like that a little gay you take a whip
and you change their behavior people say
it's discrimination but you who's
watching from home would you hire a gay
driver to take your children to school
of course not
that's just appalling and it's frankly
taking all the restraint that I have
right now not to release a charmingly
Illustrated children's book called
Marlon bando punches that guy right
square in the face
which is already very comfortably is
watch what happened when Ellen Page went
to challenge Bolton ro on some of his
views I'm gay so do you think that I
should have been beaten as a child
should not be gay now I'm not going to
look at you and say I think you're gay
that doesn't matter to me you're very
nice if I were a cadet in the Military
Academy and saw you on the street I
would whistle at you all right you're
very pretty
what are you doing he just told her I
wouldn't beat you I would cat call you
and seemed to genuinely think that was a
compliment
and look how confused that made Ellen
Page do you know how hard it is to
confuse Ellen Page she was in Inception
that should be simply as if Polaris Camp
Patton was not already dramatic enough
you may have heard he was actually
stabbed a few weeks ago during a
campaign rally which is absolutely
horrific although although he says that
he's making a full recovery and you can
tell that he is feeling better because
when he was in hospital he pulled out
what else the finger guns
now Bob's our support has actually
increased since that attack even Geraldo
Wolverine endorsed him in this bizarre
video
ah I hate what he's doing I love the way
he's doing it yeah look why is Wolverine
endorsing Boston ro I don't know why
does he seem to be driving a Ford Focus
that quest there's a lot of questions of
that video raises and I just don't have
the answers to any of them well look
there may be some small reason for hope
here a huge movement has emerged in the
last couple of weeks called Ln yow or
not him there have been massive marches
against Boston ro all over Brazil and as
you have seen tonight voting for not him
is a truly excellent idea now today's
election was supposed to just determine
who went into a two-person runoff on
October 28th but if any candidate got
fifty percent or above there would be no
second round they would just be Brazil's
president and as of right now the vote
tally shows Bolton ro and around 48
percent with over three-quarters of the
votes counted so while he will probably
go to a runoff with her dad there is
still a chance that he's going to win
outright tonight and when you think
about it why wouldn't that happen
between taping this show and airtime
boston ro could have won Ruth Bader
Ginsburg could have been eaten by a bear
and every kitten spores could have been
replaced by octopus tentacles
oh that's very possible because it seems
that that's what life is now but
if bolton ro has not won if there is
going to be a runoff in three weeks then
it still it isn't too late that's the
thing and Brazil please look I realize
that you are disgusted with your
politics in the moment and you're not
inspired by any of the alternatives but
anything is better than Boston ro diet
Lula is better
spider-man is better Gary Busey is
better that is Gary Busey I'm pretty
sure that's him the point is Boston ro
does not reflect the best of who you are
Brazil and with any luck you still have
a chance to vote la now and not let this
man finger bang your democracy
you
you
tonight
this entire show is basically going to
be one long recap of one very long week
and
and one event in particular meaning that
sadly there is going to be no time
to talk about trump insisting that the
un was laughing with him
and not at him which it absolutely
wasn't
nor is there gonna be time to delve into
what was clearly the most fun story of
the week
this all the philadelphia flyers have a
new mascot and fans are saying
what the that's seven foot tall gritty
pretty unveiled today in front of group
of kids probably scarred for life
yeah yeah those kids should be scarred
for life gritty is horrific
every single photo of him is appalling i
mean look at this one
that is a nightmare how about this one
that is simply psychotic
gritty looks like the end result of the
orange mcdonald's fry guy hooking up
with grimace and
we've been over this a million times
before on this show if you're a
mcdonald's mascot
you do not have sex with another
mcdonald's mascot
your genetics are too similar and their
kids always turn out wings
very very weird and incidentally it's
not like gritty has
any business being a hockey mascot
apparently he hasn't really figured out
how to navigate on the ice yet he fell
multiple times in his debut last night
the pittsburgh penguins tweeting lol
okay
to which gritty responded sleep with one
eye open
tonight bird holy gritty calm down
they're just engaging in some inter-team
banter and you've gone straight to i
will murder you in your sleep
and look there is absolutely nothing
that i would love to do more tonight
than
than talk about gritty all night long
from the fact that he's
already done a kim kardashian style
photo shoot
to the fact that and this is true
someone has already got an actual tattoo
of him on their body interestingly that
someone
jimmy carter unfortunately though the
fun we just had
must now stop because instead we need to
talk about brett kavanaugh supreme court
nominee and walking crushed beer can
now on thursday christine blasey ford
who was accused kavanaugh of sexually
assaulting her in 1982 came before the
senate judiciary committee to deliver
some powerful testimony
i am here today not because i want to be
i am terrified i am here because i
believe it is my civic duty
to tell you what happened to me while
brett kavanaugh and i were in high
school
right and she did just that describing
in detail detail her recollection of how
a drunk cavanaugh
pinned her down tried to remove her
clothing and put his hand over her mouth
when she tried to scream she insisted
that this could not possibly be
a case of mistaken identity because she
was 100 certain
that it was him and after her opening
statement she then took questions which
sometimes took an odd turn like when the
prosecutor to whom the republicans had
outsourced their responsibilities
seized on a polygraph test that ford had
passed
did you pay for the polygraph yourself
don't i don't i don't think so okay
do you know who did pay for the
polygraph not yet no
i believe you said it hasn't been paid
for yet
is that correct
let me put an end to this mystery her
lawyers have paid for her polygraph
as is routine wait whoa whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa whoa slow your roller as
is routine don't you try and brush her
question aside
she just cracks this case wide open
she found the missing piece of the
puzzle specifically a puzzle that reads
who cares now ford's testimony
was brave and compelling and seemed to
affect many on the committee including
republican senator orrin hatch who chose
to express his admiration
in a far from ideal way have you found
dr ford credible
well it's too early to say i i don't i
don't think she's incredible i think
she's an
attractive good witness but it's
way early what do you mean very
attractive sir
oh in other words
she's pleasing oh no no
no no pleasing
you should not use the word pleasing to
describe a sexual assault survivor
painfully recounting one of the worst
moments of her life you honestly
shouldn't really use it to describe
anything maybe
maybe watching milk mix into your coffee
except you know what
not even then because the moment you say
watching this milk is pleasing
you come off like a creepers waiting for
everyone to leave the room so he can
 his coffee
the point is by lunchtime on thursday it
honestly seemed
that kavanaugh's nomination could be
finished even fox news was implying as
much
this was extremely emotional extremely
raw and extremely credible and
nobody could listen to her deliver those
words and talk about the assault and the
impact
it had had on his life on her life and
not have the
her heart go your heart go out to her
this is a disaster for the republicans
that is fox news calling ford's
testimony a disaster for the republicans
and not like one of those puerto rico
disasters you know this time one they
might actually care about
but then then came cavanaugh's testimony
and it is worth looking at it in detail
tonight because in every regard it could
not have been more different from ford's
for starters while she was remarkably
composed in discussing traumatic details
kavanaugh came straight out of the gate
weird in his opening statement
not just denying all her allegations but
almost breaking down
while attempting to paint a foxy image
of his time in high school
i worked out with other guys at tobin's
house
[Applause]
he was the great quarterback on our
football team
and his dad ran workouts yeah
he's crying at the memory of lifting
weights at his friend tobin's house
i hate to say it but i'm starting to
think that men might be too emotional
for the supreme court
also also also
he'd be he'd be really pretty if he just
smiled more
and it wasn't just memories of a high
school quarterback that was making him
tear up
i've always had a lot of close female
friends
i remember talking almost every night it
seemed to my friends amy
or julie
or kristen or karen or suzanne or maura
or megan or nikki
the list goes on okay that's not
testimony though is it that is a
plaintive spoken word cover of mambo
number five
i remember my friends angela pamela
sandra and rita
and as i continue you know they're
getting sweeter
[Applause]
but when kavanaugh was not choking back
tears he was starting to get noticeably
angry arguing that he was the victim of
a giant conspiracy
this allegation was unleashed and
publicly deployed
over dr ford's wishes
and then and then as no doubt was
expected
if not planned came a long series
of false last-minute smears designed to
scare me
and drive me out of the process before
any hearing occurred
crazy stuff gangs illegitimate children
fights on boats in rhode island i mean
come on
do i seem like exactly the type of
person who would get into a fight on a
boat in rhode island
seriously you tell me when you picture a
fight
on a boat in rhode island do you just
picture two of me
yelling at each other at exactly this
pitch and volume is that what you say
that if you wanted my haircut you would
tell your barber to give you the
fight on a boat in rhode island well i
would like to see you say that to my
face on a boat in rhode island
and that's all i have to shout about
that you
i'll see you on the water
and remember remember
what you've just seen was him reading
from a prepared statement
it got even stranger once he started
taking questions
did you consume alcohol during your high
school years yes we drank beer
uh my friends and i the boys and girls
yes we drank beer i liked beer
still like beer we drank beer the
drinking age as i noted was 18
so the seniors were legal senior year in
high school people were legal
to drink and we yeah we drank beer and i
said sometimes
sometimes probably had too many beers
and sometimes other people had too many
beers
we drank beer we like beer yeah i get
that i
do i um i get that loud and clear
brett's but but the question
isn't really do you like beer is it it's
how much
do you like it just like how the
question in jeffrey dahmer's trial
wasn't
do you like people it was do you like
people to a really problematic extent
and when pressed on his drinking
cavanaugh became either dismissive or
outright hostile and it was at those
moments you got a real sense of who this
man
actually is what do you consider to be
too many beers
i don't know uh you know we
whatever the chart says i like beer i
don't know if you like beer
senator or not um what do you like to
drink next one is
senator what do you like judge you're
saying there's never been a case where
you
drank so much that you didn't remember
what happened the night before or part
of what happened that's
you're asking about yeah blackout i
don't know have you
could you answer the question judge i
just so
you have that's not happened is that
your answer
yeah and i'm curious if you have
okay so first aside from being deeply
disrespectful
have you is just not the answer of an
innocent person
if you ask someone if they ever blew a
dog and they go i don't know have you
that person blew a dog he blew a
dog and in all likelihood
not just one either and that that surly
tone
was emblematic of kavanaugh's demeanor
throughout the hearing not the tone of a
man who hopes
to one day have the honor of serving on
the supreme court but the tone of
someone
who feels entitled to be on it and
frankly can't believe that you're being
such a dick about this
and that actually does make some sense
because this is a man who has had every
imaginable advantage his elite high
school and this is true
has its own nine whole golf course now
am i saying that someone who went to a
school with its own golf course
should not be on the supreme court yeah
yeah i think i am
yeah yeah honestly i didn't plan to when
i started that sentence but
here we are i'm going to stand by it but
the cavalry didn't just rely on
belligerence to refute ford's charges he
brought evidence specifically
a calendar from 1982 about which he was
and i know this will shock you
weirdly emotional why did i keep
calendars
my dad started keeping detailed
calendars of his life in 1978.
he did so as both a calendar and a diary
christmas time we sit around and he
regales the old stories
old milestones old weddings old events
from his calendars now look i i know
that it may seem cruel to make fun of a
man crying over his late father's
calendars but
what if i were to tell you that his
father is still alive and was sitting
right behind him that's him there and
that is why i am now
completely comfortable saying that every
christmas we'd
gather around and dad would regale us
with old events from his calendar
is the single weirdest thing
i've ever heard
anybody say and to make it to make it
weirder remember
kavanaugh just said that his dad started
keeping calendars in 1978 when cavanaugh
was 13 meaning he would have been 14 at
the time his dad had even a single
calendar
to read to his children from and an
adult man
reading last year's calendar to his 14
year old son
is literally the saddest christmas i can
imagine
other than being one of the innocent
people who gets murdered in the movie
die hard
that is literally the only other example
and and the truth is kavanaugh's
calendar may not have actually helped
him
because while he told the panel he never
attended a gathering
like the one dr ford describes in her
allegation in fact his calendar shows
at least one similar event with at least
two of the people ford named in her
letter and kavanaugh misrepresenting the
truth actually became something
of a really troubling pattern for
instance he repeatedly made this
strong claim to poke holes in ford's
story
i just want to emphasize all four
witnesses who are allegedly
at the event have said it didn't happen
including
dr ford's long time friend ms kaiser
except this 53 year old frat pledge is
actually significantly mistaking the
facts there because in reality
three of those people merely said that
they didn't recall the party as
described
and ford's friend ms kaiser did
specifically say
she believes ford's allegation and the
fourth person there is kavanaugh himself
so kavanaugh just wildly
mischaracterized evidence and that is
one thing a judge
really should know not to do it's
basically that and don't tuck your robes
into your blue jeans because it's
objectively a bad look
then then there was the fact that for
all of kavanaugh's talk of his wholesome
teenage years spent respecting women for
their friendships and doing
sick reps in tobin's dad's house his
high school yearbook tells a very
different story for instance he and his
bro
friends brag about being renata alumni
referring to a girl that they knew now
kavanaugh claims that that was
completely asexual and just
clumsily intended to show affection and
that she was
one of us which is a little hard to
believe given that a renata only just
found out about it
and said the insinuation is horrible
hurtful and simply untrue
and b if it was just affection for a
friend where's the alumni society for
amy
or julie or kristen or karen
or maura especially maura
mora most of all now
kavanaugh had similarly implausible
explanations for other terms in the
yearbook specifically those commonly
associated
with drinking or sex have you i don't
know if it's buffed or boofed
how do you pronounce that that refers to
flatulence we were 16.
let's look at uh beach week ralph club
biggest contributor what does the word
ralph mean in that
that probably refers to uh throwing up
i'm known to have a weak stomach and i
always have devil's triangle
drinking game
the term devil's triangle is commonly
known to refer to a threesome involving
two men and one woman so i'm just not
buying that
unless all your drinking games were
named after widely recognized sex acts
oh doggy style drinking game uh
you pour vodka in a bowl and you lap it
up while wearing only a dog collar
a fisting drinking game that's gripping
a shiraz in each fist and toasting the
progress of feminism
69 absolutely drinking game that's
listening to brian adams hit song summer
of 69 while
uneventfully drinking a beer on the
porch
even c-span callers were not buying this
whole drinking game defense
go ahead carl hi i just wanted to echo a
few things that another caller said
which is that a devil's triangle is
certainly not a drinking game
it's an encounter with two men and a
woman
we'll go next to mary in bronxville new
york
i i like to imagine that that guy calls
in
every day to describe what a devil's
triangle is and that was the only day he
stood even a chance of getting all the
way through his explanation
look while it may seem unbelievably
petty to give this much attention to our
high schoolers yearbook
you have to remember that to some extent
many were watching this hearing
to try and ascertain who was more
trustworthy was it the
terrified psychology professor who blew
up her entire life to relive her trauma
on a national stage
or was it judge animal house who seemed
to be sweatily making up drinking games
before members of the senate
and yet for some senators kavanagh's
poor performance was completely
immaterial
as they had already made up their mind
orrin hatch taking a break from being
pleased made the broadcast that it was
ridiculous to even ask
questions about an event that took place
such a long time ago
this is a national disgrace the way
you're being treated
there's been no whisper of misconduct by
him in the time he's been a judge
[Music]
our main story tonight concerns Facebook
the worst place to wish happy birthday
to a friend other than a funeral now
Facebook has been in the news a lot
recently over concerns about everything
from privacy to fake news to Russian
trolls but tonight we're actually going
to go in a different direction and focus
on his behavior overseas because
Facebook has been expanding aggressively
abroad more than half its revenue come
from outside the US and eighty percent
of its users now live in foreign
countries posting things like this yes
that is that's an international version
of the in my feelings challenge the
thing that took Facebook and Instagram
by storm after being popularized by the
Shiggy show and you can learn more about
all of that in my new book I don't know
what any of these words mean but my
staff assures me it makes sense for
years Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg
pushed his utopian idea that all
connections are good connections with
feel-good ads showing him bringing the
Internet to the world and Facebook
employees proudly saying things like
this by connecting the world people
realize that there are other people in
the world who have different lives in
them and that maybe their lives could be
better and then amazing things happen
you want to do something big and you
have this access to you know 1.2 billion
people what can you do is just limited
by your imagination look connecting
billions of people does sound great but
it's also important to remember that
when it comes to the Internet a certain
number of those people are then going to
say Jews control sharks who did 9/11 and
you really have to think that through
unfortunately thinking things through
has never really been Facebook strong
point there early motto was famously
move fast and break things a sentiment
which Zuckerberg has explained this way
we want to build our culture and our
infrastructure so that we just try to
move you know one or two clicks faster
than than other companies and you know
sometimes we go too fast and we mess up
a bunch of stuff and then we have to fix
it and that's cool is that cool is that
cool at all mark because that seems like
maybe the most reckless corporate motto
since the hindenburg companies fly fast
and smokes
and a big bag of hydrogen how did you
not foresee the problems that were
heading your way and make no mistake
Facebook has broken things overseas
sometimes they were small for instance
over the summer there was an earthquake
in Indonesia and while Facebook
undeniably connected people there it
wasn't necessarily in the way the
situation demanded as this international
news report shows normally Facebook
sends the balloon and the confetti
animations to users wishing each other
well
however the Indonesian work for
congratulations selamat can also mean
unheard or to survive so when Facebook
users posted messages saying I hope
people will survive Facebook give them
celebratory animations yeah
that's not ideal is it because there's a
time and a place for balloons and it's
very rarely after the word survived in
fact let me prove that to you
I have some terrible news we may have to
eat each other to survive no no that's
the worst time for that and look look if
if embarrassing mistranslations were the
only problems that Facebook had that
would be one thing but the company has
made some hugely consequential mistakes
overseas and that is what tonight's
story is about in the Philippines and
Cambodia Facebook has been accused of
empowering authoritarians in Sri Lanka
India and Indonesia viral rumors and
hateful comments on Facebook have been
linked to outbreaks of deadly violence
but for the worst distillation of what
Facebook can do to a country just look
at Myanmar the country who thinks so
little about you didn't even realize
that's not Myanmar that's Mikhail
Gorbachev's birthmark
this is Myanmar now Myanmar
also known as Burma was for decades cut
off from the world under military
dictatorships but in recent years as its
transition to a quasi civilian
government internet use there especially
a Facebook has exploded in 2013 just
over 1 percent of citizens had internet
access but now 18 million people are on
Facebook thanks in part to becoming
pre-installed on mobile phones and heavy
promotion by service providers who
didn't charge Facebook usage against
data plans yeah we can use Facebook for
free except for looking at photos and
watching videos everything is free we'll
use Facebook for free and ask the things
we want to know I'll use empty tea and
post everything to Facebook it's free
let's use Facebook for free with MPC ok
just quick question is Facebook free cuz
I'm worried that commercial didn't quite
make it clear so with Facebook's so easy
to access it basically became the
internet so much so that people in
Myanmar use the terms internet and
Facebook interchangeably and look some
people there use Facebook for fun that
guy you saw earlier lives in Myanmar
while other people find it to be a
complete waste of time like this
irritating teacher everybody said easy
it's my phone playing games I hate I
hate I don't like it's a terrible look
likes boys Facebook is a toilet
find it okay I get that he's annoyed but
calling Facebook a toilet is a little
unfair to toilets because they make
go away whereas Facebook retains
disseminate to your acquaintances
and reminds you of from seven years
ago or what allow the corporation's to
put their in front of you what I'm
saying is there is a purity and
integrity to toilets that Facebook
seriously lacks but Facebook's issues in
Myanmar go well beyond distracted
teenagers because if you have glanced at
the not Trump section of the newspaper
at all recently you are probably aware
that Myanmar is a majority Buddhist
country with a long history of religious
and ethnic tensions particularly with
regard to the row hinge er a mostly
Muslim group in the western part of
Myanmar in 2017 and military executed a
brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing so
far about seven hundred and twenty-five
thousand role hinge about three-quarters
of the population have fled to
Bangladesh to escape government troops
one estimate puts the death toll
conservatively at around 10,000 people
and to be clear Facebook didn't cause
that I feel comfortable saying it Mark
Zuckerberg not guilty genocide in
Myanmar as of this taping but but and it
is a big but by all accounts Facebook
absolutely did inflamed pre-existing
tensions there in fact a report on
Myanmar prepared by independent UN
investigators said Facebook has been a
useful instrument for those seeking to
spread hate and it is weird to hear
something that started out as frivolous
be described like that it's like if five
years from now you and investigators
called bubble tea and aggressive threat
to human rights holy I mean
honestly I never really liked it but
Jesus Christ
but hate speech against Muslims and
especially the row hinge er flourished
on Facebook posted by military leaders
and politicians as well as prominent
Buddhist monks like Ashton were are - -
Muslims have a place here in Burma we
can't repeat his actual response its
r-rated but essentially he said Muslims
were defecating on Burma threatening its
very existence you don't like them very
much
mahjongg i don't accept them why did i
because they're deceiving the world they
want to take over the whole country that
monk is so hateful he has actually been
called the Burmese bin Laden that's
right a Buddhist monk is known as the
Burmese bin Laden which is as jarring as
if you found out there's a Care Bear
known as the one who because to be
honest I always thought wish bear would
be the one who I mean look at him
that Beth Fox
lerato had hundreds of thousands of
followers on Facebook and he uses pages
to wreak havoc including spreading false
accusations that a Muslim business owner
had raped a buddhist employee a post
that helped instigate riots in the city
of mandalay in 2014 in which two people
were killed and around 20 others injured
and yet despite repeated warnings about
where our to facebook didn't get around
to banning him until earlier this year
and that is just one example of the
extent to which facebook became an echo
chamber of Islamophobia one local
official told reporters he was proud to
oversee a Muslim free village even
though he admitted he had never even met
a Muslim before adding I have to thank
Facebook because it is giving me the
true information in Myanmar and here is
what happened when ABC talked to people
in the streets there most local people
here get their news via Facebook and
judging by what people have told us they
are not getting the whole picture what
do you think about the
I think they are terrorists they are
extra they're making problems everything
I could gather information from Facebook
what does Facebook say they want to
occupy our land and our people that is
very very dangerous because no one
should be judged by the worst things
people say about them on Facebook if I
were judge by that you'd think I was a
cuck twit a prime example of why
abortion should be more readily
available and that I look like a
distressed bird in a pet shop trying
desperately to get your attention and I
ask you is any of that apart from that
last one really fair I would say no I
would argue not so so how the did
so much hate speech and violence
inciting content stay up for so long
because it's not like Facebook doesn't
have rules they have a lot of them their
own internal materials get into details
like which sort of anuses photoshopped
onto faces they're willing to allow this
is true they even cite graphic examples
such as this image of Trump with an anus
for a mouth that is apparently allowed
by the way because he is a public figure
Taylor Swift with anuses for eyes also
allowed for the same reason but this
image of kim jeong-hoon with an anus for
a mouth is apparently not okay because i
quote it also displays a sex toy
inserted into the anus but that still
leaves gray areas doesn't it for
instance what if I display a meatball
sub being inserted into that same mouth
anus is a meatball sub a sex toy could
you not argue that meatballs are the
anal beads of Italy and by the way Olive
Garden that slogan is free for you to
use
look you can have it it's yours look you
can quibble you can absolutely quibble
with where Facebook draws its lines and
the broader discussion of private
companies policing speech is an
important one but the point is Facebook
does have standards that are enforced in
a number of ways they have artificial
intelligence that automatically detects
some objectionable content and removes
it they also rely on users like you and
me to flag objectionable content which
is then reviewed by human moderators
it's something most social media
companies do and it is a thankless job
as you can see from this training
session run by a Content moderation
company in India here the person is not
naked but you can see their exxor shape
is visible now this lady's now here it's
very much obvious that intensely sees
focusing on but part the camera is
focusing on but part it will fall under
nudity it's not proper nudity but it
will fall under nudity I'm sorry I'm
absolutely calling it that guy is
definitely focusing on the buttocks but
as Facebook themselves will tell you
policing nudity is the easy part what's
harder is defining and spotting
misinformation hate speech and that is
what Myanmar has been drowning in and
Facebook system failed them at every
stage first their a I didn't work
because Facebook's technology isn't
compatible with me amaz language fonts
which you know not great but fine that
just meant that they badly needed
Burmese people to flag content for them
but to do that it really might have
helped if things like their community
standards and reporting systems had been
in Burmese which they weren't until late
2015 which isn't great in the country
where almost no one speaks English just
imagine if Facebook Facebook's interface
here was in Burmese you would have no
way of knowing which button did what in
fact that's not even Facebook's
interface that's just a list of
dinosaurs ranked from most to least
 and by the way
Stegosaurus is way too far down on that
list
Stella Soros is basically the wish bear
of dinosaurs seriously
that bear can get it but but wait wait
because it gets worse even content that
did get flagged in Myanmar often didn't
get taken down and one reason with that
may be that Facebook had shockingly few
Burmese speaking content reviewers how
many you know I'll just let this Reuters
reporter tell you back in 2014 they had
one person they hired a second in early
2015 they out sourced an operation
they'd been doing that for a while but
they had had no burmese speakers at all
until 2015 when they hired - it's true
first they had one then they doubled it
to two and through outsourcing added two
more so full and I don't know what the
exact right number of Burmese speakers
for Facebook is but it probably
shouldn't be possible for the sum total
of them to be decimated in a tandem bike
accident and it's not like Facebook can
plead ignorance or surprise about any of
this multiple civil society groups and
individuals try to warn them as far back
as 2013 five years ago that they face
trouble in Myanmar and Facebook itself
now admits that they move too slowly
though Zuckerberg insists that they're
now making progress they've hired 60
burmese speakers me recently told
members of congress that they're looking
for more we're hiring dozens of more
Burmese language content reviewers
because hate speech is very language
specific it's hard to do it without
people who speak the local language and
we need to ramp up our effort there
dramatically hate speech is language
specific it's a little weird to hear a
guy who's been universally lauded as a
genius and a visionary say something
that's completely obvious as if it's a
brand new idea to him it's as if Steve
Jobs called everyone together for his
brand new discovery mrs. Doubtfire was
just the dad in a costume yeah we know
Steve
did you not get that I thought you were
smart I don't trust my iPhone now but
for all his reassuring words many argue
that Zuckerberg still hasn't done nearly
enough hate speech is still widespread
on Facebook in Myanmar last month four
months after Zuckerberg promised to do
better
Reuters found more than a thousand
Burmese language posts attacking the row
hinge ER and other Muslims that were
still on Facebook and short you could
say well come on Reuters was actively
looking for those but you know who else
could do that maybe a company worth 500
billion dollars
Reuters doesn't have 500 billion dollars
their journalist doesn't even seem to
have a decent webcam get the man a
decent webcam Reuters his work is
 important and despite its 60
hole Burmese speakers Facebook is still
struggling with the language there in
fact earlier this year there community
standards were so badly missed
translated into Burmese that instead of
saying we take our role in keeping abuse
of our service seriously they said we
take our role seriously by abusing our
services and small things like that
really matter
even punctuation can change the meaning
of a sentence for example and this is
true Bill Cosby once wrote a book that
I'm guessing was meant to be called come
on people but they admitted the comma so
it read come on people
and deep down perhaps that's when we
should have known and look look I am NOT
saying that the challenges Facebook is
facing and not significant but for a
company that moves fast and break things
they have sure moved slowly in trying to
 fix them and until they do it is
painfully obvious that everyone should
be treating anything on their site with
extreme skepticism and see Facebook for
what it actually is a fetid swamp of
mistruths and outright lies interspersed
with the occasional reminder of a dead
pet that's it
that's what it is so instead of
producing idyllic ads about connecting
the world at the very very least
Facebook should be producing ads that
prepare countries for how to deal with
their product Oh suggest something like
this hi we're Facebook we're connecting
the world
and we're coming to your country whether
you like it or not so there's one thing
about Facebook you should probably know
somewhere between eighty and a hundred
percent of what's on our site is
 complete my Facebook
page is full of lies about how happy I
am my Facebook page say I go to yoga
I'll be like three times my Facebook
page says I'm a 19 year old girl all my
photos are of me we are baby but I don't
have baby fun
we at Facebook believe in giving
everyone a voice without worrying too
much about what that voice then chooses
to say I mean how bad could it be I
don't believe the Holocaust happened Oh
yikes can someone please explain to me
why what Charlie Rose did was so wrong
I wouldn't post that but you can George
Soros invented mosquitoes Hillary
Clinton created aids yeah I'm sure about
that there is only one old cent winner
moving back and forth very fast look
it's not our place to tell you you're
wrong we're about making connections can
you connect me to my brother
sure can you connect me to coca-cola oh
we can absolutely do that but I gotta
admit I'm an animal a go-getter matter I
mean familiar I'm not sure what you just
said but it sounded great the point is
Facebook is a platform anyone can use to
do good or bad it's riddled with
 and quite honestly we're never
gonna be able to control or contain it
so before you use our site for the first
time there's something you badly need to
remember Facebook is full of
Facebook is full of we spoke with
John see Tom to base boogie no mirrors
por nada first movie John said mom
Facebook are the rust disgusting got a
lily left of this book in a posh way
they like karma so in my team Bunton ah
coilette Facebook outlook on junk
Facebook's our toilet and God willing
your country will survive it sure we've
really gotta fix that Facebook
we're toilet
[Laughter]
[Applause]
trait the basic system of barter an
exchange that you have to do really
carefully or you'll end up with Dwight
Howard Syria seriously parents talk to
your children about trade you don't want
to go to school with Peter Lunchables
and coming home with Dwight Howard the
baby's gonna add a three-point shot to
his game now kids grow up no trade trade
is a subject on which our current
president considers himself particularly
expert trade that's what I'm gonna do so
good I'll take those traders and make
them so good that's what I do
I love taking bad deals and making them
good I love trade you know trades always
been my thing I could name ten different
forms of trade I know every one of them
hey the Wharton School of Finance right
here yeah I can name ten forms of trade
there's a free trade fair trade Rough
Trade Trader Joe's that's what eight
then there's human trafficking that's
like trading for people well rounded up
and call it ten Wharton School of
Finance Roy here Thomas talked a big
game on trade for decades and he spent
this year slapping tariffs on products
from China Canada the EU and others
prompting them to retaliate with tariffs
of their own and this trade war has
escalated fast from tariffs on just 18
products at the start of the year to now
over 10,000 so things have gotten pretty
serious and American workers are already
being impacted particularly in
agriculture we're feeling a lot of pain
right now in in the farm sector it's
affecting farmers a negative way I
always hope that one morning president
Trump's just going to wake up and and
send out that 3:30 in the morning tweet
that says tariffs are gone wow that is a
depressing thought so that guy's
livelihood depends on a tweet that says
tariffs are gone and even if Trump does
end up doing that at 3:30 in the morning
you just know it'll say tariffs a goon
and we'll all have to decide what he
meant by that so tonight before things
get much worse let's take a look at this
trade war because it's tempting to think
that Trump has a plan after all trade is
his thing and he's tweeted trade wars
are good and easy to win but for years
his strategy on that seems to have been
based around little more than tone of
voice so easy I drop a 25% tax on China
and
and you know I said to somebody that is
really the messenger the messenger is
important I could have one man say we're
gonna tax you 25% and I could say
another listen your we're
gonna tax you 25% oh I see okay so the
tone is important so if I were to say to
somebody that's not how trade
negotiations work that would be one
thing but if I were to say that's not
how trade negotiations work you're dumb
 that would be much more
effective there are some very basic
things about economics that he seems
genuinely confused by take tariffs Trump
wants tweeted that if the trade war
doesn't end other countries will pay us
vast sums of money in the form of
tariffs we win either way but that's not
how tariffs work tariffs are taxes
designed to make foreign goods more
expensive therefore making domestic
products more appealing other countries
don't pay us tariffs importers here too
when they receive the goods and they
usually pass that cost along to the
consumer so when Trump imposes a tariff
on an item you are probably going to pay
more for it as reporters have been
trying to explain in the most literal
way possible here in the kitchen
made in China utensils and appliances
like stoves and refrigerators are being
targeted upstairs in the bathroom
everyday items like shampoo nail
clippers makeup and towels could mean
higher prices for things like instant
coffee and this harley-davidson
motorcycle everyday items like the iPad
could be hid the tablet has a chip from
Intel which could be a target East
Cooter's have taken off this year now
they face a 25% tariff okay I hate to
admit this but if one of the key
casualties of this trade war is e
scooters I actually think I'm fine with
that
well basically is Dane Cook somehow
became transportation
and it's not it's not just tariffs that
Trump seems to misunderstand there's
also our trades deficits basically the
number that expresses how much more we
buy from other countries than they buy
from us Trump talks about it all the
time usually like this our trade deficit
ballooned to 817 billion dollars think
of that we lost 817 billion dollars a
year over the last number of years in
trade in other words if we didn't trade
we'd save a hell of a lot of money okay
okay so there's a lot to unpack there
first our trade deficit is actually 552
billion so he was off by a quarter
trillion dollars water school of finance
right there a second trade deficit
aren't actually always bad and many
economists believe for very complex
reasons involving savings rates and the
dollar special status as the world's
reserve currency that America's trade
balance might be more or less where it
should be and finally and this is
important when we have a trade deficit
we don't lose money it's not a big pile
of cash that we handed over we bought
things that we received and I'm not
saying that it was all valuable does
anyone really need the pony up daddy
saddle which allows your child to
symbolize their newfound dominance over
your life no I didn't need it but I
wanted it and honestly it's brought my
dad and me closer together even the
world leaders that Trump has been
fighting with seem alarmed by how little
he understands trade EU Chief
jean-claude juncker reportedly met Trump
armed with a series of colorful simple
flashcards to explain the trade war and
the work that really gets me there is
colorful because that means that means
that they have some simple flashcards
and thought no too wonky let's get some
big fun baby colors on those things
let's give him a chance and Angela
Merkel struggled to explain something
even more basic the independent
newspaper setting an unnamed senior
German official ten times Trump asked ms
merkel if he could negotiate a trade
deal with Germany every time she replied
you can't do a trade deal with Germany
only the
on the 11th refusal Trump finally got
the message Oh we'll do a deal with
Europe then so he understood but only
after the 11th refusal just listen to
what that sounds like
deal with Europe ha deal with your ha
deal with your ha deal with York ha deal
with your ha
deal with your car deal with your car
[Applause]
deal with your honestly I'm just amazed
that after the fifth time Angela Merkel
didn't turn to our translator and say
okay you're fired you can't
possibly be translating this right I'm
not I am not saying that it's easy to
understand trade it's one of the most
complicated issues there is technically
politically and emotionally over the
years free trade has been criticized
from all sides and people argue that
unfettered trade can reward the worst
behavior of multinational companies and
exploit countries with fewer protections
for labor and that has unquestionably
happened but Trump generally confines
himself to arguing that trade is
responsible for the death of US
manufacturing jobs and while there is
some truth in that automation is the far
bigger culprit we actually still make a
lot of things in America US factories
now manufacture twice as much as they
did in 1984 but they do it with 1/3
fewer workers and the overwhelming
consensus among economists is that trade
between countries generally speaking can
create jobs lower costs and be a net
benefit to both nations essentially
think of trade like sex if you're doing
it right it can be good for both
partners though the odds of that
happening plummet as soon as Donald
Trump gets involved and the problem the
real problem with Trump not
understanding trade is that he therefore
doesn't understand its consequences for
instance one of the first major shots he
fired in this trade war was putting
tariffs on steel and aluminum that was
great news for the people working in
those specific industries like this
worker in a Missouri aluminum plant you
you think that his policies are kind of
why you have a job today I know what is
you know it is yeah I want to have a job
offer if it didn't happen wish I could
meet him and give him big old hug
you know yeah I do know and I honestly
get why he wants to hug him Trump got
him his job back is one of two possible
explanations for that man wanting to hug
Donald Trump but the other of course
being that if during the early stages of
the campaign Trump and Melania were
driving through Missouri on a stormy
night and their car broke down Donald's
not getting out some Melania ends up
climbing out into the rain and opening
the hood as that aluminum worker comes
driving down the highway he rolls down
his window and asks if he can help to
which Melania gratefully asked maybe a
flashlight and just if the aluminum
worker is handing the flashlight over it
gets struck by lightning and they switch
bodies
so now Donald is living in the White
House with an aluminum worker who feels
understandably weird about holding his
hat while Melania is forced to point
after her husband from the factory floor
her heart's aching for him every second
of every day knowing full well that
revealing her true identity would just
complicate things for everyone but
that's Melania you go to him
the world will accept your love that
aluminum worker clearly isn't in love
with him everyone can see it and its
players so much
but that individual guy in that
individual job things have improved but
when it comes to trade nothing happens
in isolation and then there are
downstream effects to those tariffs not
too far from where that guy works there
is an eighth nail factory which suffered
because thanks to Trump steel tariffs
the price of their raw material steel
skyrocketed sales dropped in half and
they've laid off over a hundred workers
and those that remain are worried some
of these people this is the only ink of
their guide just like me this is the
only thing inked up I got and I got to
put another daughter through school you
know it's very hard yeah it is that's
the problem here protecting steel help
steel but it hurts anything made from it
and you have to balance those
consequences by one estimate Trump's
tariffs may create 26,000 jobs in steel
and aluminum but could cost over 400,000
jobs across the rest of the economy so
if trump's trying to create jobs almost
anything would be a better idea than
tariffs he'd be better off dressing a
turtle up like david bowie and throwing
him into a pool full of milk will that
create jobs of course not but it won't
actively lose hundreds of thousands of
them plus it'll be the highlight of
ziggy she'll dusts life and listen
listen we're still only scratching the
surface of how complicated this is
because distinguishing between a foreign
product and an american job can be a lot
trickier than you'd think
take some of trumps favorite villains
when it comes to foreign companies they
sell mercedes and BMW and the cars come
in by the millions and we hardly tax
them at all we can't do this stuff
anymore
we protect Germany Germany who doesn't
have a BMW we're gonna tax Mercedes Benz
we're gonna tax BMW we're gonna tax all
of those beautiful Mercedes Benzes that
are coming in at wicked attacks BMWs
that are coming in Trump is furious with
German cars and here is here's the thing
about that in the clip where he said who
doesn't have a BMW to the crowd in his
classic man-of-the-people way so trunk
is actually in North Augusta
South Carolina and just two hours drive
away is a place called Spartanburg
County
well known for this Spartanburg is home
to the largest BMW plant in the world
last year they made more than 370
thousand luxury SUVs employing 10,000
people pumping billions into the state's
economy yeah it seems Trump didn't know
that look everyone knows he doesn't know
a lot of things but occasionally it's
important to remember that he also
doesn't know anything it's true it's
true I'll show you
everyone close your eyes right now and
think of something that thing you're
thinking of he doesn't know that and
since the trade war began Spartanburg
County is actually double because
they'll be affected by higher costs for
the steel that they use to build the
cars and when they try to ship them to
China
they'll be hit by Chinese tariffs so
they are in complicated trouble or as
Trump might put it listen your
 you get in tax twice so so
if a trade war could be this disruptive
and the net benefits are likely to be
this negative why is Trump doing this
especially because members of his own
economic team seem against it Gary Cohn
reportedly left over the proposed
tariffs and Steve minuchin Treasury
secretary and white hot sex bomb has has
tried to do some damage control by
claiming we're not actually in a trade
war at all this has been a trade dispute
all along it never was a trade war it's
a trade dispute oh I get it it's not a
war it's a dispute you know what I
always almost bought that
because I'm so distracted by this
lavaridge sex volcanoes looks the guy's
hypnotic I must have a bad case of the
Manucci 'he's right now because he's
looking like an absolute snack so so who
is who is telling the president that
this is a good idea well by most
accounts the driving force is Peter
Navarro head of the Office of Trade and
manufacturing policy
he's Trump's trade guy isn't that right
Peter I'm the trade guy thanks Peter
so so just just for the record let's all
get our Trump administration role
straight we've got trade guy Lyle ad
nothing boy Jesus please a word ghoul
crime nymph drunk grandpa and daughter
wife it's a it's a well-oiled machine
he's running
now Navarro is the author of a series of
get rich investment books and like Trump
he's obsessed with trade deficits in
general and China in particular saying
trade with China is a zero-sum game
meaning one country can only win if the
other country loses and it is hard to
overstate just how rare his views are
among economists when the New Yorker
profiled him they asked a Varro to help
them find even one colleague who agreed
with him he gave them two names one was
Peter Murray see a University of
Maryland professor who said of Navarro
he has a rather severe position that
zero-sum statement I have a problem with
that
where's his proof and the other was a
blogger named Allen Tolson who Navarro
described as a fine economist to which
Thomson replied I do not hold an
economics degree and I'm guessing
Thomson also doesn't hold a degree in
web design because this is the photo on
the about page of his blog so if you are
understandably wondering at this point
then how on earth did Navarro get a job
at the White House well it is
way dumber than you are thinking
apparently Jared Kushner was tasked with
finding Trump experts on Chinese trade
and this is how he went about it so
Jared went on Amazon
he fired up his computer and he found
some of Peter Navarro's books and he
asked him to come to the White House
that's how Peter Navarro ended up in the
White House yeah Jared looked for
experts on Amazon that was his rigorous
process so when Jeff Sessions does get
fired be prepared for him to be replaced
by crystal kaswell author of the erotic
fiction novel dangerous rock a dangerous
noise novel because for whatever reason
that is honestly the first thing that
came up when we typed good law person
parentheses smart into a bizarre
now the Navarro book that Jarrett found
was called death by China and it paints
the u.s. Chinese trade relationship in
apocalyptic terms because while there
are some legitimate complaints about
China's unfair practices they've
deliberately depressed their currency
they violate intellectual property
rights and arguably skirts WTO rules
this book goes way further with chapter
titles featuring phrases like
shanghaiing the gene pool and look mark
there's a death star pointing at Chicago
and Navarro actually turned the book
into a movie that one critic called the
documentary equivalent of a raving
street corner derelict which seems harsh
until you see how the movie begins the
film you're about to she addresses one
of the most urgent problems facing
America
it's increasingly destructive trade
relationship with a rapidly rising China
it starts like that it's warm up is a
literal knife being stabbed into the
heart of America and if you are worried
that that leaves it with nowhere to go
please don't be concerned because there
are even less subtle animations to come
which depict China's trade practices as
guns and bombs that blow up American
factories and stunningly deceptive
moments like this China has stolen
thousands of our factories and millions
of our jobs multinational corporation
profits are soaring and we now all over
three trillion dollars to the world's
largest communist nation I'm not saying
that that large ball isn't very
convincing but our trade deficit isn't
the same as what we owe to China those
are two different numbers and neither of
them is anywhere close to three trillion
dollars and when something that central
to your movie has something that wrong
with it
you usually have to replace it with
Christopher Plummer so so so Navarro is
not someone who any legitimate
economists take seriously and yet he
seems to be the only person the
president is listening to Trump has
called death by China right on and
lauded its facts figures and insight and
Navarro returns the compliment saying of
his own job that my function really as
an economist is to try and provide the
underlying analytics that confirmed
Trump's intuition and his intuition is
always right and that is simply
terrifying because the economists
shouldn't be finding ways to confirm the
intuitions of someone who doesn't know
what they're talking about it's like a
builder working for a child saying my
job is to build this house he designed
which is shaped like an ice-cream cone
with a window that's also a door and the
size of the Sun and a dog his intuitions
are always right no they aren't you need
to stop that child before someone gets
 hurt
in fact if you want to get a sense of
just how little Navarro understands the
game he's playing consider this since
this trade war began
China has imposed 37 billion dollars of
tariffs on the u.s. now take a look at
what Navarro said back in March
are you expecting China to come back
with retaliation I don't believe any
country in the world is going to
retaliate for the simple reason that we
astroturfing which sounds like a new
teen trend of artificial grass
while eating cascade pods that's right
the teens have moved on from tide it's
all about cascade now astroturf ping is
the practice of corporations or
political groups disguising themselves
as spontaneous authentic popular
movements it's basically fake grassroots
that's why they call it astroturf II
it's a very funny very clever name
now you're probably familiar with
astroturf II as a concept from C ads by
groups with a generic populist sounding
names like Americans against food taxis
delivering weirdly specific messages
like these Washington is talking about a
new tax on Jews rates of soda they say
it's only pennies
well those pennies add up when you're
trying to feed a family
Washington if you're listening but
doesn't seem like much to you can be a
lot to us
tell Congress no taxes on juice drinks
and sodas well it won't surprise you to
learn that Americans against food taxes
was not started by regular Americans
pooling their resources together to take
out a large ad buy on national TV about
their number one problem priority a
proposed soda tax no it was a front
group for the food and beverage industry
which makes a lot more sense soda
companies have a lot of money at least
enough to convince the LeBron James to
pretend he drinks sprite sprite diabetes
you can taste and and well you might
think well yeah but that's obvious I'd
never fall for astroturf like
that
don't be quite so sure because with dark
money surging in the wake of decisions
like citizens united astroturf
techniques are now becoming more
sophisticated effective and dangerous
and they are not going away so tonight
we thought it might be useful to take a
look at some of those techniques to help
us better spot them in the future
let's just start with the names
themselves because sometimes groups are
created with deliberately misleading
names for instance the group save our
tips which purportedly speaks for
waitstaff is an anti minimum wage
increase group funded by restaurant
owners the National wetlands coalition
worked on behalf of oil companies and
real estate developers and the American
Council on science and health has been
funded by among other things
fracking interests soda companies each
cigarette companies and chemical
manufacturers so it's pure straight-up
opposite world it's like if this show is
called funny time happy hour with
shuttle honks John Oliver
it's just demonstrable false we can't
back that up and look it's not
always easy to spot exactly what the
group's motive is especially with an ad
like this don't eat here
what's with your people tossing money at
the Humane Society of the United States
these HSUS losers aren't even affiliated
with your local pet shelter for more
information go to humane watch.org that
is a very strange ad because first of
all if you're going to have a talking
dog what would you make him such a gruff
 hey I'm Tony and I'm mad
the Humane Society's a bunch of losers
and if you disagree you can suck my dark
dick
and second second who would take out an
attack ad on the Humane Society a rival
even humane er society puppy mills
self-loathing dogs it's impossible to
say for sure all I can tell you is that
ad is the work of Rick Berman
a PR expert who's known in the industry
as dr. evil he is known for his defences
of controversial products from
secondhand smoke to trans fats to payday
loans he's also created nonprofit groups
that have fought regulation of all of
those things in fact it's one of those
groups the concentr the Center for
Consumer Freedom which was credited on
that Humane Society attack ad so if is
the Center for Consumer Freedom a front
group full Berman's corporate clients is
it at all relevant that Rick Berman has
shown up at events for the pork industry
and industry which has been targeted by
the Humane Society in the past for the
use of gestation crates or as Rick
Berman insists on calling them maternity
pens I can't say I legally can't say I
want to are badly wanted but I've been
explicitly told I can't you can probably
guess but I can't say it out loud what I
can say is that Berman rejects any
accusation that he runs front groups for
corporate clients saying there is no
front because there is total
transparency which is a little odd
considering we don't know who's behind
many of his campaigns and that message
of transparency does seem to
significantly change whenever he's
behind closed doors because here is
audio of Berman pitching his services to
a group of oil executives people always
ask me one question you said how do I
know is that I won't be found out as a
supporter of what you're doing we run
all of this stuff through nonprofit
organization
that are insulated from having to
disclose donors total anonymity see
transparency but look look he is right
there is total anonymity and just as a
general rule if the most common question
you get asked is how do I know no one
will find out on doing business with you
that's not a great sign if the same
privacy guarantee that Hardee's gives
all of its customers don't worry none of
your friends family or coworkers will
ever find out that you've been doing
this now go and enjoy your monster
thickburger before the horse meat gets
cold
but astroturfing is more way more than
just funneling money through nonprofit
front groups groups can also recruit
questionable experts to lend their
arguments credibility there are multiple
examples of this but my favorite
concerns a group called citizens for
fire safety a few years back health
officials in California wanted to remove
a requirement that furniture contained
chemical flame retardants as they had
been linked to cancer but citizens for
fire safety produced a burn surgeon dr.
David heimbach who argued for keeping
all of those flame-retardant
requirements by telling them a pretty
memorable story 7 week old baby was in a
crib laying on a fire-retardant mattress
on a non-fire retardant pillow mom put a
candle in the crib candle fell over the
baby sustained a 50-percent burn the
entire upper half of her body was burned
oh this is a tiny little person no
bigger than my Italian Greyhound at home
she ultimately died after about three
weeks of pain and misery in the hospital
now that sounds horrifying but there are
some weird things about what he just
said first I don't know why he felt the
need to compare the size of a baby to
his Italian Greyhound
everyone knows what size our baby is
nobody's never seen a baby so wait it's
like a person but smaller tell me more
doesn't use stilts how does it board a
bus what I'm picturing is something
about the size of five hamsters taped
together a very small lawnmower a mine
around the right ballpark here but
second if part of you there was
wondering hold on
who puts a candle in their baby's crib
you're not alone journalists with the
Chicago Tribune wondered the exact same
thing and they soon discovered that two
years earlier home back and testified
before a different California panel
telling a weirdly similar story I will
tell you about a child I took care of in
April mom had a candle for sitting at
beside the bed left the room for seven
minutes for reasons we don't know the
child that candle turned over the child
sustained an 80 percent burn okay so now
this is starting to sound a little
suspicious how many people are putting
lit candles in and around their baby's
cribs oh I just put little Ethan to bed
I put plenty of lit candles in his crib
as a nightlight and I balance several
sharp knives and open cancer pain filler
right on the crib wall so he has
something to look at look look home back
wasn't done because just a year later he
was testifying before the state
legislature in Alaska and guess what a
six week old baby that I took care of
earlier this year mother went away there
was a candle on the bureau somehow the
dog knocked the candle onto the crib and
the little girl sustained this seventy
five percent very devastating burn wait
so now there's a dog involved all of a
sudden what kind of dog would do such a
thing wait a second I know exactly what
kind of dog a gruff needlessly Italian
dog like tongue
by God but God as if as if sensing that
lawmakers there were questioning his
motives
the very next centers the home back said
completely unprompted was this I am not
in the pocket of anybody that makes a
specific flame retardant now so be fair
he's actually right about that he was
not in the pocket of someone that made a
specific flame retardant he was however
in the pocket of citizens for fire
safety who paid him $240,000 for his
help and who it turned out only had
three members which were the three
largest makers of flame retardants in
the world so I call it liar liar pants
chemically incapable of catching on fire
oh and what Northey when a reporter
called the medical examiner's office
they had no record of any burn victim
matching heimbach's description
whatsoever so one of them did the next
logical thing i thought the best thing
to do was just to call him at home i
said those kids you talked about did
they all die in your hospital he said it
wasn't factual it was anecdotal and i
said but that's not what you testified
and he said well I wasn't under oath
okay okay
well first of all you're generally
expected to tell the truth even when
you're not under oath and second of all
anecdotes aren't the same as lies I saw
Keri Russell walking out of a bakery
that's an anecdote it's not a good
anecdote but it is an anecdote I saw
Keri Russell riding a dragon out of a
bakery that is a lie although admittedly
would be a way better story and look the
real problem there is home backs lies
worked that flame-retardant bill in
California initially failed thanks in
part to his testimony and and the final
and paps most controversial tool in
astro surfing relates to something that
our current president actually loves to
complain about I'll tell you what you
take a look outside
these are paid protesters folks the
protesters are paid a lot of money by
the DNC it turned out that the
protesters were used to have
we're bought for $1,500 apiece we have a
protester by the way were you paid
$1,500 to be a thug
now I can't walk it quite out there is
Trump angry or is he excited he's just
stumbled onto a job opportunity that
John Julie and Eric would actually be
qualified for but for what Russ specific
accusations were nonsense
hey demonstrators do exist which Trump
should frankly know himself because his
campaign reportedly had actors who were
paid $50 to cheer for him and his
campaign announcement but but paid
demonstrators are one of the most
infuriating tools of astroturfing just
just look at what happened last year in
New Orleans
a company called Entergy needed city
council approval for a controversial
power plant which it got not long after
a public meeting where by sheer chance a
bunch of huge power plant fans in orange
shirts turned up now it later emerged
that a PR firm working for Entergy hired
a company called crowds on demand which
recruited actors to supports in the
plants they did this with a facebook ad
which offered and I quote 60 to $200 e
dues to help with a gig for three hours
which in itself right there is a red
flag dollar e dues sounds like slang for
money that you'd find in a Mark Twain
novel called even for the 1800s there
are way too many n words in this crowd
of demands even provided talking points
such as folks this is 2017 we had a boil
water advisory here last month and I'm
tired of feeling like I live in a third
world country and it seems like some of
the people there took those notes and
ran with them I'm tired of feeling like
we're living in a third world country
this is the United States of America its
2017 going on 2018 and we have to worry
about these frequent water boil
advisories and so on and so forth I have
to be concerned that a grandmother or a
son or a pet could possibly drink or
take in some brain-eating ameba
yeah I'll give him credit for that last
but the brain-eating ameba bit was all
his own he was just riffing hard at that
point now now that man insists that he
believed everything he said and that he
wasn't paid by crowds on demand although
you should know that another person
there who does admit to being paid said
he received instructions that read a few
things to keep in mind one tell nobody
will being paid to tell nobody you're
being paid three media will be present
do not talk to them for tell nobody
you're being paid and five if somebody
approaches you don't tell them you're
being paid which are and this is true
word-for-word the vows in a traditional
Scientology wedding now if you look
they're beautiful vows and you should go
now if you are wondering who is behind
crowds on demand let me introduce you to
their CEO Adam Swart the answer to the
question what if a lukewarm bottle of
smirnoff ice was a person now now he's
he's pretty unrepentant about what his
firm does have you ever provided
protesters for an event of course
demonstrators of course do you see
anything wrong with that personally nope
do you ever feel like you're tricking
people though into getting behind
something that they may have not gotten
behind if they didn't see all this
activity there we don't trick people we
engage them yeah yeah but you engage
them by tricking them don't you both
both of those things can be true at the
same time it's like someone saying I'm
not masturbating in the middle of this
Pinkberry
I'm just engaging the police department
you're actually doing both and one
doesn't make the other okay now of
course what's whole ruse is predicated
on people holding their nerve and not
giving the game away in real time but
amazingly that has happened in the small
town of Camarillo
I think the city needs a shake of
citizens aren't shy about expressing
their opinions but one chilly Wednesday
night in December Prince
Jordan Tyson city officials say this man
stood out this case is clearly common
sense because for three minutes he told
the City Council what he later admits
was a lie I'm just a concerned citizen
coming up here and speaking to you but
he's not he's a self-described
struggling actor from Beverly Hills it
goes by the name of Prince Jordan Tyson
okay no I don't believe it I do not
believe it does anything about this face
this face say struggling actor from
Beverly Hills to you I'm sorry this
story just doesn't check out but
incredibly it's true because while they
know Toya's pjt initially claims to be
from the area he soon had a crisis of
confidence culminating in this forty
minutes later
Tyson came back to the podium Prince is
back for one of the strangest moments
the City Council has ever seen I don't
agree with the reason I'm here and I was
paid to be here how much were you paid
hundred bucks how much $100 you're
 idiot Prince you just broke
ground on Tim Barnes rules one two four
and five now you won't get those
hundred-dollar e dues which could have
gone toward changing your name to
literally anything else or getting a
haircut that doesn't make you look like
an out dente Owen Wilson when you add
all of this together faith groups hiring
fake experts and fake crowds which
managed to affect real world change it
gets pretty dispiriting and it can do
real damage that goes way beyond the
narrow issues that each group is trying
to influence the very existence of
companies like crowds on demand mean
that something authentic can now be
tainted in fact conspiracy boards now
regularly and wrongly cite crowds on
demand as providing everything from paid
protesters for Charlottesville to crisis
actors for the Las Vegas shooting and
that is hugely dangerous because the
consequences of this cannot be that
everyone assumes that anyone who doesn't
agree with them is astroturf you know
what while skepticism is healthy
cynicism real cynicism is toxic and
because this problem isn't going it away
going away it is now even more incumbent
on us to use our judgment diligently if
the Ray Liotta of docks is telling us
the Humane Society is terror
it's probably worth us all asking why
why who might have trained him and what
do they stand to gain and unfortunately
until we find out a way to force
astroturf groups to be more transparent
and accountable that's about all we can
do right now astroturf is a serious
threat to our public discourse and it is
critical that we are all much more aware
of its dangers
and since astroturf furs have left all
their tools lying around at the very
least we might as well use them to fight
candle fire with candle fire and deliver
a heartfelt message we're all Americans
real people definitely not actors were
just a coalition of Concerned doctors
mothers teachers and kidnappers and we
think you deserve the truth about
astroturf furs here are the facts
astroturf furs are responsible for every
shark attack in American history wonder
all the B's have gone after jurors shot
him in the face and according to the
bipartisan Institute of factual science
studies every single astroturf fur has
killed at least one puppy with their
bare hands or maybe not we're not under
oath the point is that's what surfers
set this baby on fire that's not a dog
that's a real baby no bigger than an
Italian Greyhound
her name's Eleanor and she likes for
things but binky hood Bava corporate and
political transparency and not being on
fire and right now
Elinor is open for and if you're not
careful one day a pastor is going to
come to your house and like your baby
fire stop and structure they paid for by
citizens for fresh orange juice
you
criminal justice the process by which
you are arrested charged and eventually
go before a jury who render their
verdict we find the defendant Robert
Brooks not guilty we find Randall Bailey
guilty we find the defendant not guilty
have you reached the wording guilty or
not guilty
that is just objectively charming
although all these years later I still
can't believe those penguins wrongfully
convicted the Central Park five now
whenever whenever we talk whenever we
talk about criminal justice reform we
tend to just talk about policing public
defenders judges and prisons and skip
over a crucial element there prosecutors
the attorneys who work for the federal
state and local government and bring
cases to trial there are roughly 2,500
DA's offices all around the country and
they have a surprising amount of
influence at almost every single stage
of the criminal justice system because
prosecutors decide whether you get
charged and what you get charged with
and therefore heavily influenced what
kind of sentence you could face and you
you sort of know deep down how important
they are because of a little phrase that
crops up constantly
in local news crime stories ultimately
it'll be prosecutors who decide whether
charges will be filed prosecutors will
decide whether to file criminal charges
prosecutors will decide what happens
next prosecutors will decide exactly
prosecutors will decide it's one of
those three word phrases that you hear
so often you don't even think about what
it means anymore like User Agreement
update or some restrictions apply or
Tyler Perry presents you know at this
point I'm just going to assume that he
presents everything it's safer that way
I technically think he presents this
show I wouldn't be completely surprised
about that
I look we tend not to think about that
power very much except when there is a
high-profile controversy concerning
prosecutors failure to exercise it as
has happened in numerous police
shootings of unarmed black men or when
Manhattan da saw Vance declined to
prosecute Harvey Weinstein in 2015
citing insufficient evidence despite
police officials insisting that they had
plenty of evidence including Exhibit A
his face but but it but it is worth
talking about what happens when
prosecutors do decide to exercise that
power because while many try to do their
jobs honorably that power can be misused
or amplified the inequities inherent in
the system and let's start with a truly
incredible fact here the vast majority
of the time your fate is not decided by
a judge or a jury of your peers because
nearly 95 percent of the cases
prosecutors decide to bring end up with
the defendant pleading guilty now what
that means is no trial no innocent until
proven guilty just a prosecutor striking
a deal behind closed doors and many
judges are resigned to that fact because
at least plea bargains keep the system
moving the system would collapse if
every case that was filed in the
criminal justice system were to be set
for trial the system would just entirely
collapse exactly it's an inadequate
system that only functions if people
constantly give up it's built on the
exact same model as AT&T x' customer
service hotline that's right AT&T new
owners of HBO longtime owners of an
unforgivably dog customer service
hotline
if somebody pleads guilty they they must
have done it that's not necessarily the
case in Houston testing of samples in
drug cases have exonerated 133 people
since 2014 and those people had pled
guilty in every single case which is
messed up the only people who should be
claiming to have used drugs when they
happen to awkward teenagers at high
school parties oh I'm totally a wieder
I'm into all the weeds I'm stoning right
now that's how potted I am so so why do
innocent people plead guilty what
prosecutors will often offer a deal
while threatening that if you go to
trial they will stack charges against
you and pursue a much harsher sentence
it's something commonly referred to as a
trial penalty just listen to Rodney
Roberts he was accused of a sexual
assault the DNA evidence later proved he
did not commit and I'll let him explain
what he took a deal when I finally got
to the court this attorney he came in
and told me that the prosecutor office
had a plea agreement from it and like
plea agreement even do it you know I
pled not guilty I'm innocent
he was like this urgent he was this
pressure and he was like if you don't
take this deal the only offer your two
years you're home in two years and if
not you know they're gonna take it off
to trial and a judge is ready to give
you a life sentence if you get found
guilty and I think you're gonna get
found guilty and this is my attorney
telling me it's the one person I had to
dead out me so I thought that to get
home to my son
they're my family and established in my
life that the best thing I could do for
myself was to plead guilty and fight it
once I got home and as crazy as it
sounds to hear that it kind of makes
sense two years in prison is terrible
but a life sentence is absolutely
terrifying the only way that makes sense
were defendant to risk that is if
they're a gerbil because two years in
life are basically the same thing to
those litters
but but but let's say you are one of the
five percent of people who risk going to
trial prosecutors still have lots of
ways to try and gain an advantage for
instance prosecutors are not allowed to
discriminate by race during jury
selection and if it's suspected that
they are the Supreme Court has said that
they could be required to provide race
neutral explanations for striking tours
which sounds like a good rule but it has
been laughably easy for them to get
around because judges will accept just
about any reason in Texas a training
document for prosecutors even
conveniently listed examples of
race-neutral reasons that judges had
accepted including having a 1970s hairdo
being a very pretty girl who might be
attracted to the defendant or the
defense counsel wearing a Malcolm X hat
agreeing with the OJ Simpson verdict
being a male wearing earrings in both
ears and my personal favorites for
wearing a bad boys club jacket pink hat
and snakeskin belts which is just
insulting because that look does not
make you untrustworthy it makes you
awesome I like the way I look at
guarantee perhaps the area where
prosecutors can exert the most influence
concerns evidence because they control
the case files things like police
reports witness information and physical
evidence and while they are required to
hand over anything that is exculpatory
or that might be useful in your defense
in some states including New York they
can do that at the very last minute
something incredible happens on the day
of trial certainly a case file that for
a year was this thick suddenly now
becomes this thick and so in our most
serious cases in the cases where we have
climbed to are looking at incredible
amounts of potential jail time even life
in jail this is what we are given when
DA's answer ready for trial and the
reality is is that in Manhattan too
often it is trial by ambush it's true
and they can then have to argue a case
without having read all the important
material it's basically a much higher
stakes version of a kid giving a
presentation in English class without
having read the book in conclusion
whether Heights the heights are watering
but by the end the heights rather much
more than they weathered at the
beginning of the book thank you for your
time just a quick but important message
for English teachers no one has ever
read a single book you have ever
assigned it has never happened not once
and look sometimes defense attorneys may
not be given exculpatory evidence at all
in fact among exoneration cases around
1/4 of them involve prosecutors
concealing its culprit ory evidence and
that is because prosecutors typically
get to decide whether something is
relevant to the defense which seems
inherently flawed
you can't just count on an adversary to
voluntarily expose all of their
weaknesses in Star Wars the rebels had
to steal the Death Star plans the Empire
didn't just email it to them with a
subject line for word gigantic stupid
weak spot parentheses very dumb go to
town and when prosecutors do withhold
evidence there is very little
accountability for them take Michael
Morton like in 1987 he was wrongfully
convicted of his wife's murder after the
prosecutor in that case withheld crucial
pieces of exculpatory evidence now the
good news is that prosecutor Ken
Anderson was held to account for that
misconduct the bad news is there was a
slight discrepancy between the two men's
sentences Morton served nearly 25 years
in prison
8900 95 days and now the sentence for
the prosecutor just 10 days in jail for
contempt of court 10 days and he served
less than half that although before you
get too mad he did also have to pay a
$500 fine which which isn't really the
penalty you'd expect for wiping out 25
years of someone's life it's close to
what you'd expect for a
cantaloupe at Whole Foods 10 days for
the public indecency $500 for the
cantaloupe
and to make it to make it even worse
Anderson is actually the only prosecutor
to ever serve any time for misconduct
resulting in a wrongful conviction ever
because the truth is prosecutors rarely
face any sort of consequences for
misconduct state bars are supposed to
hold them accountable but a study of
five states found that in 660 cases
where courts had confirmed prosecutorial
misconduct the number of prosecutors
disciplined in those cases was one and
that lack of accountability can fuel a
dangerous culture where winds are
already prioritized to a disturbing
degree in fact in one DA's office in
Colorado
prosecutors were paid bonuses for
achieving a high conviction rate and in
Texas a DA rewarded convictions in
misdemeanor cases with a prize that they
called the trial dog award and let me
just say as the proud proud owner of
nine trial dogs my award goes to this
one please don't die please please don't
die I can't how important it is for you
to hang in there and and and there was
there was the notoriously aggressive
office also of New Orleans DA Harry
Connick senior who is yes Harry Connick
Jr's dad in fact here they are on Harry
jr. short-lived talk show singing a
weirdly inappropriate Joette just well
the
[Music]
[Applause]
Harry's wild about me the heavenly
places of his kisses
yeah now if you didn't see any problem
with that he's just a fun experiment for
you to try at home call your own father
right now
tell him that the heavenly bliss is of
his kisses fill you with ecstasy and
just see how that goes my prediction is
your next fishing trip is going to be
extra quiet but during his time as New
Orleans da lots of people were wild
about Harry Connick senior because his
office was famously ruthless Harry
Connick was tough on crime he was very
aggressive and he wanted to block him
all up forever conics lead prosecutor
was Jim Williams Jim took great pride in
his numerous death penalty convictions
he even kept a miniature electric chair
on his desk Jim was regarded as one of
the most aggressive prosecutors in the
District Attorney's Office he described
sliding up behind defendants in the
courtroom and buzzing in their ears to
mimic the the buzz of electricity holy
 that is just not okay although
there was also literally no scenario in
which sliding up behind someone in
saying buzz in their ear is acceptable
not even if you are Neil Armstrong on
the moon and you need to get Buzz
Aldrin's attention hey buzz buzz buzz
buzz we're on the moon buzz buzz buzz
buzz are you mad I was first buzz buzz
but but that office is win at all costs
culture resulted in some serious
mistakes as it turns out fully a quarter
of the men sentenced to death during
conics tenure had their convictions
overturned because of improperly
withheld evidence and remember that
little electric chair when the
prosecutors had on his desk here's a fun
fact in the photo of Jim Williams with
the electric chair of the five faces
visible all of them were released from
death row yep
the thing he kept as a token of his
success is now a monument to poor
decision-making it is the prosecutorial
equivalent of Cuba Gooding jr. zaask er
and look if you want to see why did that
joke upset you more than anything else
tonight you have got to be consistent
you've got to be you might care about
Cuba you care about him too much in this
context and look if you want to see all
the problems that I've described tonight
in action just take a look at the case
of Glen Ford who was on death row for 30
years after being wrongfully convicted
now the prosecutor on his case Marty
Stroud says that he got caught up in an
aggressive hard-charging culture and
admits to among other things
deliberately excluding African American
jurors and overlooking evidence that
would have cleared Glen Ford and what
happened clearly still haunts him I
ended up without anybody else's help
putting a man on death row who didn't
belong there I mean at the end of the
day beginning in middle whatever you
want to call it I did something that was
very very bad yeah it was it was very
very very bad in fact the problem is
that while he is clearly remorseful in
terms of accountability there were no
professional sanctions for his actions
in fact the acting da after Ford was
released Dale Cox doesn't even believe
that Stroud should have apologized did
mr. Ford get justice in this case I
think he has
gotten delayed justice the system did
not fail mr. Ford it did not it did not
in fact the system you see that because
he's not on death row and that's how I
can say it getting out of prison after
30 years is justice well it's better
than dying there and it's better than
being executed yeah I guess that's true
but listen to how low he's setting the
bar they're better than being executed
or dying in prison by that measure
anything succeeds Taco Bell
better than being executed or dying in
prison although when you think about it
is it is it definitely between 2010 and
2014 that man's office was responsible
for sending more prisoners to death row
than anywhere else in the country and if
you think the Glen Ford debacle may have
made him more cautious you would be
wrong I think society should be
employing the death penalty more rather
than less but there have been ten other
inmates on death row in Louisiana who
have been exonerated clearly the system
is not flawless
are you sure that you've gotten a right
all the time I'm reasonably confident
that that I've gotten it right
oh you're reasonably confident are you
that does not seem like it should be the
standard to send someone to death row I
was reasonably confident I could pull
off bangs I was wrong about that
and if someone's life depended on it I
might have given it a little more
thought and look at this point you may
well be wondering how can we fix some of
what we've seen tonight well clearly
permanent legislative fixes are badly
needed from requiring greater
transparency from prosecutors about
sharing evidence through so-called
open file laws to ideally establishing
independent commissions to investigate
misconduct but depending on where you
live there may actually be a more direct
way for you to effect change because
DA's are usually elected it's something
you might sometimes forget until you see
aggressive campaign attack ads like this
one which ends in a bizarre turn of
phrase this is how many child molesters
the Calcasieu Parish do
he has prosecuted as lead counsel
how many murders how many rapes Roberts
meanwhile our sheriff reports crime is
on the rise and Calcasieu Parish Steve
Street for District Attorney
he'll try harder and a lot more but he
would try a harder and a lot more often
that's a pretty weak promise Steve the
 was your opponent's Logan Nathan
Hamilton justice on Mondays and
Wednesdays unless something comes up
well it seems like it's gonna be a whole
thing look the facts prosecutors are
elected means that you can change them
the problem is around 85% of prosecutors
actually run unopposed in both primary
and general elections it's gotten so bad
that in one County in Washington state
their prosecutor had run for ten terms
without any opposition so four years ago
in frustration someone ran ran their dog
against him I know I know what you're
thinking I'll great another white dog
prosecutor and I'm not saying you're
wrong but let's go one step at a time
here look clearly we need more
reform-minded DA's to run because thanks
to the extreme breadth of power they
have that could actually be a backdoor
way to effect change on a whole host of
issues from fail to the misuse of
forensic science to the enforcement of
marijuana laws and maybe you are one of
the lucky ones here maybe your local DA
is great
or maybe they're a win obsessed
whose heavenly Bliss's of their kisses
fill their adults songs with ecstasy or
maybe a live in Washington State over
the past four years your district
attorney has been this dog and
you didn't even realize it because can
you honestly say with a hundred percent
certainty that your district attorney is
not a dog you probably can't and that's
kind of the problem here most people
know as much about their local DA as
they know about their local Cheesecake
Factory manager chances are you don't
know who they are and if you do it's
probably because something truly
terrible has happened
but the truth is like the Cheesecake
Factory
prosecutors have the ability to ruin
lives in a second so so we need to find
out who our DA's are and get a sense of
the policies and priorities that they're
carrying out where we live because if we
do not decide ourselves what we want the
criminal justice system to look like
deep down you know who will exactly they
 will
sexual harassment in the workplace which
you may know from its supporting role on
the hit show Mad Men and look who better
to talk about it than me a man
when will the male perspective on
harassment be heard the public has been
crying out well wait no longer tonight
is the night we've been dealing with
workplace harassment for decades as
demonstrated by this unfortunately
titled training video from 1981 what's
wrong with that huh everything is a
matter of fact when it's unwelcome and
when it occurs at work
okay so first never call it good old sex
you sound like a grandfather explaining
the birds and the bees let's talk about
good old sex tiger because sometimes pop
up likes to stick the old spatula in me
Moore's Easy Bake Oven you get it you
get it the kid gets it but but the fact
is the fact is store brands Ted Danson
is right workplace harassment is
something important to discuss and it's
been in the headlines again this week
with the New Yorkers expose a about CBS
and les Moonves coming hot on the heels
of similar investigations into everyone
from Harvey Weinstein to Charlie Rose to
SpongeBob who five different employees
accused of being unable to keep his
sponge dick in his SquarePants
you're a monster whenever the subject of
workplace harassment comes up you can
bet on one thing men getting very
nervous I think right now men are scared
yeah and you could get to a point where
women are gonna be denied opportunities
to advance in corporate America because
men don't want to be alone with a woman
don't want to be in the same office as a
woman I'm so scared to look at a woman
I'm so scared to compliment a woman I'm
so scared to even a hug woman because I
better have a big enough bank account
for her to turn around and file a
complaint or file a lawsuit against me
huh I'm starting to be concerned that
innocent people are afraid of being hurt
and that's a bad sign and so the
question is what are the rules how do we
find out what they are how do you know
if you're guilty what is going on you
know you know you can tell so much about
a question from the mayor tone with
which it is asked because what are the
rules is not inherently a bad question
to ask if you want to know the answer
are the rules sounds more like an
erections temper tantrum but but but the
point here is it does seem like we're on
the verge of a national reckoning about
sexual harassment major companies like
Ford have had to pay multi-million
dollar settlements and promised to
change their corporate culture a wave of
women are now running for office in
what's being called the year of the
woman and times up was even a theme of
this year's Oscars show now
unfortunately everything I just said
also describes the 1990s when powerful
companies like Ford paid out
multi-million dollar settlements and
promised to change their culture and a
wave of women ran for office in 1992
prompting it to be called the year of
the woman and that theme was the
backdrop of the next year's Oscars
featuring this moment
[Music]
we'll leave
[Music]
ouch
the only way that could be anymore on
the nose is if after they sang Hillary
will lead the way Donald Trump came on
stage grew up to the backup dancers and
somehow won best picture despite losing
the popular votes conversation in the
90s was largely kick-started by the
experience of this woman and if you are
too young to remember who that is first
enjoy snapchatting your student loan
avocado toast or whatever it is you
people do and secondly daddy's that is
Anita Hill she was compelled to testify
before the Senate Judiciary Committee in
the confirmation hearings of Judge
Clarence Thomas and she informed them
that Wayne she'd works for him years
before she's been repeatedly harassed
she gave a detailed account of
inappropriate behavior from unwanted
advances to Thomas bragging about the
size of his own penis to an infamous
story about a pubic hair in a coke cap
which is the most disgusting thing you
could possibly discover in a coke can
other than Pepsi and and while enough
senators believed Thomas's denials to
confirm him the terrible treatment that
Anita Hill received during the hearings
inspired a nationwide effort to stop
workplace harassment once and for all
now clearly that did not work so tonight
since we seem to be going in circles on
this issue let's try and at least talk
about it if only because no one wants to
see ending workplace harassment as the
unofficial theme of the 2048 Oscars
hosted by a somehow still ageless Paul
Rudd and let's just start with one of
those basic questions that Tucker Carson
wind into his camera what are the rules
it's something that continues to confuse
people despite all those shitty training
video showing examples of a dangerous
office culture have you seen the new
blonde secretary over at shipping
to see the file man listen of you boys
are impressed with her typing and filing
wait until she takes your dictation
[Music]
now I realize this isn't necessarily the
most relevant criticism of that man's
behavior but he just left without
washing his hands that was that was just
zero daylight between the time his
fingers adjust if his colleagues necktie
and the time they adjusted his own penis
but but but the questions what is sexual
harassment actually does have an answer
because while companies may have their
own policies from a legal standpoint
sexual harassment is considered a form
of employment discrimination just like
discrimination on the basis of race or
age it becomes unlawful when it is
severe or pervasive enough that it
creates a hostile environment or when it
includes a quid pro quo meaning
employees have to ensure the harassment
or risk losing their jobs so that is
what constitutes sexual harassment under
the law it's not a single shitty joke or
a botched compliment it's going out of
your way to make someone else's work day
a psychosexual nightmare but of course
behavior doesn't have to be illegal to
be inappropriate anytime that you're
making someone else uncomfortable that's
going to be a problem and some of this
involves judgment and considerations so
is a hug okay well in certain situations
maybe I would argue if it's from behind
never and incidentally is a hug okay
he's Britain's top selling sex ed book
and the answer is simply no the problem
is some people have decided to handle
the complexity of this issue not by
modifying their behavior but by
modifying their staff and I will let
instantly exhausting Easter Island head
to Tony Robbins the author of the book
the worst person you know is currently
reading this I'll let him explain
tonight Tony Robbins taking heat after
these comments
robbing saying some men in Hollywood now
afraid to hire women what are you
talking about Tony you do get them
that's not a story about a problem with
the me to move it right that's a story
about a man who shouldn't be allowed to
have employees at all you you probably
think Jeffrey Dahmer was just the victim
of dangerous men and boys who walked
around all day being too edible now this
thing is unfortunately arguments like
that can slow down any movement towards
finding real solutions and too often
aspersions are cast on anyone coming
forward from they're just doing it to
get rich - they're just doing it for
revenge - why are they coming forward
now and it is strange that we go there
so quickly because that just doesn't
happen with other traumatic events if
your house burnt down you wouldn't
expect a newscaster to immediately start
asking what are you coming forward now
was this insurance fraud wish your house
wearing something flammable and is it
even on fire at all because where is the
line between fire and not fire anymore
it's so hard to tell I'm terrified to be
around houses anymore but with sexual
harassment that is so often where these
conversation immediately goes with
immediate concern less for the victim
and more for the accused there is no due
process right now right now accusation
allegation goodbye everybody gets fired
I wonder if you destroy men or complete
the destruction of men there they're
pretty close to being destroyed I would
say how's it up women exactly it's true
it's absolutely true men are destroyed
it is the end of man women are taking us
down and even worse
they even worship monsters now now that
all the Ghostbusters are women that
means that when we die we'll spend all
of eternity being destroyed by more
women it's not
look look the court of public opinion is
far from an ideal place to deal with
individual claims but it's worth
considering why some who've been
harassed feel the need to speak publicly
publicly because it often has to do with
the fact that we have a piecemeal
inadequate process for addressing the
issue privately the law requires you to
first go through the EEOC before you can
file an employment discrimination
lawsuit and they are notoriously
difficult to win and while state laws
vary if you work for business with less
than 15 employees there is no federal
remedy for workplace sexual harassment
not and let's say you don't want to file
a lawsuit maybe you like many people
don't don't even want your harasser to
be fired you just want the bad behavior
to stop that is where a company's HR
department might come in but people can
be reluctant to go to HR for
understandable reasons HR exists to
protect the company from liability not
necessarily to seek justice on an
employee's behalf and all those guys
that you just saw complaining about due
process should really know this because
they work out Fox News where harassment
allegations are so relevant that their
biggest stars have been dropping like
suspects in an Agatha Christie novel
there were there were multiple
allegations against Bill O'Reilly after
which their parent company responded no
current or former Fox News employee ever
took advantage of the 21st Century Fox
hotline to raise a concern about him and
maybe that is because those women knew
that the huge power disparity between
them and O'Reilly was unlikely to work
in their favor though this is something
that was actually pointed out to our
Riley but perhaps the single worst
person imaginable every allegation in
this area is a conviction they don't
look for the truth but think about those
five women and what they did they came
forward and filed complaints against the
biggest star at the network they worked
out think of how intimidating that must
have been how nerve-racking that must
have been doesn't that tell you how
strongly they felt about the way they
were treated by you wow that is an
admirable confrontational question Matt
Lauer you've really backed him into a
corner pressured him into giving you
what you want
locked the door behind him
metaphorically of course
metaphorically of course but but as we
now know the absence of calls to a
hotline does not mean an absence of
systemic sexual harassment and while
bill o'reilly denied the allegations
against him he reportedly settled one of
them for thirty two million dollars
thirty two million dollars to one person
and that's where the negotiations ended
up and a figure slightly more than the
production budget of lala land o'reilly
allegedly engaged in a lala lands worth
of harassment so if nobody called fox's
HR hotline that might be a problem with
their HR hotline and when you
combine a toxic workplace with a lack of
confidence in systems of accountability
bad things can happen just look at the
US forest service where women have been
coming forward describing a boys club
atmosphere rife with harassment and
retaliation just listen to one employee
explain what she went through in filing
a complaint i wanted justice but i
wasn't like in it for some personal
vendetta i don't want this to happen to
other women and i don't want him to do
it like in the future her complete
detailed several instances of
inappropriate physical contact
once he rubbed her butt another time it
was her inner thigh another time he
grabbed her breasts put his hand between
her legs and groped her two months later
the Forest Service sent her a letter it
said an investigation against
allegations of misconduct was conducted
and we found that there was no
misconduct and so then it just feels
like you're like screaming into a void
like this happened and nobody hears that
or believes that were they hear it and
don't believe it at all that is very
depressing and honestly I can't even say
on that surprise that the Forest Service
is a hotbed of sexual misconduct what
sort of government agency routinely
allows an employee to show up to work
without wearing a shirt and I do not
want to hear the excuse Oh Smokies our
bear of course he doesn't have a shirt
he
personalized hat and belt that
is wise for shirts put one on and look
look the point is it's not about him the
point is she's not alone Abbi bot
a battalion chief with the Forest
Service was sexually assaulted while on
assignment and while she did tell the
police she didn't press charges and her
description of why she felt she couldn't
tell her bosses about the incident is
just heartbreaking
watching somebody that would file a
complaint or make a complaint
immediately became the problem and you
know we have the term that girl or those
girls I don't want to be one of those
girls you know I've I've introduced
myself that way to people I think before
like hey I'm now you don't worry I'm not
one of those girls or one of those girls
being someone who simply says that
behavior is wrong let's do something
about it exactly I was I was trained
that way my whole don't be one of those
girls that is just terrible and the
culture that she's describing is way too
similar to the culture that we thought
we could work to eliminate the last time
we had a big conversation about this
back in 1991 with Anita Hill and re
watching the Senate debate about her now
it is depressing how many of the
techniques used to undermine her are
still around today from concern over
false allegations to blaming the victim
to outright character assassination let
me tell you the law of sexual harassment
is so broad that a person can accuse
another at any time and and and ruin
their reputation just by a unfounded
allegation how could you allow this kind
of reprehensible conduct to go on right
in the headquarters without doing
something about it
I really am getting stuff over the
transom about professor hill I've got
letters hanging out in my pocket I've
got faxes statements from Tulsa Oklahoma
saying watch out for this woman but
nobody's got the guts to say that
because it gets all tangled up in this
sexual harassment crap literally the
only parts of that montage that would
sound at all out of place today are the
words transom and the concept of faxes
again for young people a fax is like if
it it's like if a text message a
telegram a telegram is like you know
what young people never mind go back to
your avocados the tragic fact here is
what we've made progress some progress
regarding workplace harassment since
then we clearly haven't come far enough
so what can we do well I would say the
first step for both management and
employees is awareness of the problem
the next is for companies to develop
workable internal mechanisms to deal
with sexual harassment and for employees
to change those behavior patterns which
might contribute to it change is in the
air though now now that we know this
form of discrimination exists we must
put an end to it and you know what I
think we will and and I'd love to say
I'd believe that but remember that good
old sex video that I showed you earlier
the one from 1981 this is how it ended
the first step for both management and
employees is awareness of the problem
the next is for companies to develop
workable internal mechanisms to deal
with sexual harassment and for employees
to change those behavior patterns which
might contribute to it change is in the
air now that we know this form of
discrimination exists we must put an end
to it and we will yes spoiler alert we
didn't and now I'm saying the same thing
it's like the movie Groundhog Day and
just like that movie there's entirely
too much unacknowledged workplace
harassment happily in plain view
she's your producer bill and it's always
her first day look look the the large
point here is time was supposed to be up
in 1981 and 1991 and now time is
supposed to be up again will this go
around be any different I honestly don't
know but I do know an expert in this
field that may have some suggestions
take a look in 1991 Anita Hill testified
for eight hours in front of the Senate
Judiciary Committee enduring humiliating
questions from a panel of world-class
 she's now a professor at
Brandeis University and was kind enough
to meet with me professor Hill thank you
so much for sitting down with me thank
you it's good to be here so it has been
27 years since you've testified in front
of the Senate what has changed in that
time oh there's been a tremendous amount
of change
there's been a change in public attitude
and there's been a change in the amount
of information that we have about sexual
harassment there's certainly more
awareness after the me to improve my
even a few years ago people were
ambivalent about which it the
consequences should be if someone is
behaving incredibly badly and abusing
people they work well I guess the
problem is there that awareness of a
problem doesn't necessarily make
something better I've been aware of
Coldplay for years but that hasn't
seemed to help the issue go away right
people were aware of it but there was no
consensus on what should we do about
that you've suggested you can fix the
women you can fix the guys or you can
change the culture and if we fix the
guys and change the culture we won't
need to fix the women that's right you
know that and so far much of the
approaches we've had is to put all of
the burden on women
one of the questions I got this sort of
6000 to me is you know how do we raise
our daughter to make sure that she
doesn't set herself up to be a victim of
sexual harassment mhm these are the
kinds of things that we're thinking if
we fix her then she won't encounter this
problem in a reality that's she is not
the problem so let's talk about man I'm
a man in the broadest possible sense of
the word let's talk about men's role
regarding trying to fix sexual
harassment do men have a role in that
discussion yes well that's good yes it's
nice to be needed oh well you all need
it we need you to step up I'll realize
at this point in time there are no
innocent bystanders if you are aware of
something you acknowledge it you know
it's wrong but you don't do anything
about it then it's the same as
[Music]
science essentially math disguised as
dinosaurs and outer space to try and
seem interesting
specifically the story concerns
gene-editing it's a topic you may have
heard about given it's now a plot point
in action movies like rampage what's
happening to my friend are you familiar
with genetic editing changes will be
incredibly unpredictable is he the only
one oh you didn't know about the 30-foot
wall
[Music]
wait a second wait just a second let me
get this straight this is a movie about
aerial military equipment being
harnessed to fight a 30-foot wolf and it
is not called Wolf Blitzer that is a
huge boost opportunity that's movie
malpractice there look gene-editing
isn't only showing up in movie starring
rock the Dwayne Johnson no it's also now
constantly brought up on TV with with
varying degrees of excitement or extreme
alarm a stunning and controversial
breakthrough in science has arrived
gene-editing
this is a milestone that could one day
erase hereditary conditions some fear
the technology could be used to create
designer babies these technology has the
potential to change our DNA and the DNA
of all organisms alive and extinct could
that lead to eugenics could that lead to
new divides in humanity I don't know
that stuff is that's just scary
exactly it seems gene editing is either
going to cure all disease or kill every
last one of us and the truth is anytime
there is a bold new technology people do
tend to go nuts
I'm guessing after the invention of the
refrigerator there were a rash of
headlines like can meat be too cold and
what about the milkman America's
friendly neighborhood we're done so
tonight we thought we'd take some time
to talk about gene editing what it is
what its potential could be and what the
chances are that we're all going to be
killed by a 30-foot wolf and let's start
with the fact that gene noticing
actually isn't new there have been
technologies like these around for years
what is new and what is driving a lot of
recent coverage is something called
CRISPR which stands for crunchy rectums
in sassy pink ray bats
except it doesn't it stands for this but
you won't remember that and you actually
don't need to so let's go back to the
crunchy wrexham thing CRISPR is very
complicated but but one of the key
scientists who unlocked its potential
Jennifer Doudna has a simple way of
explaining how it works I like to use
the analogy of word processing because
it's very analogous to that you think of
the DNA code like the text of a document
this is the scissors that allows you to
cut out text change it the cell takes
over after this after
the DNA is broken and makes a precise
change at the site of the repair right
that is very basically it it's like cut
and paste in Microsoft Word if there's
something that you want to fix on a
strand of DNA with CRISPR you could
theoretically find it cut it out and
paste in a fix
at which point presumably Clippy shows
up and says hi it looks like you're
trying to play God and alter the basic
building blocks of life these sapele
Crispus potential is huge there are
hopes that they might eventually be
applied to more than 10,000 conditions
from sickle cell anemia to cystic
fibrosis to some cases of early onset
Alzheimer's but gene editing is wildly
difficult diseases typically have
multiple genes that contribute to them
and human trials have been extremely
rare although there have been some
promising results just months ago baby
Layla was dying of acute lymphoblastic
leukemia so doctors agreed to try out an
experimental immuno cell therapy which
had never been used outside the lab the
result astounded her parents I took the
gamble and this is her today standing
laughing giggling and I'm the fact with
a miracle that's fantastic
and he's right it is a miracle except
really think about it it's actually not
it's science which I'd argue is actually
better and more convenient than a
miracle because you don't have to spend
the next two thousand years worshiping
the scientist you can just be like
thanks amazing story for the most part
applications of Gina acing have been
confined to experiments on plants and
animals where the results have been
striking if often a little weird
researchers at this lab used CRISPR to
isolate and manipulate the beagles
muscle or myostatin gene making these
the most muscular beagles in the world
okay okay all right so you might think
it's strange that scientists mage act
sexy beagles but did you ever even
consider that the scientists were lady
beetles change your preconceptions about
what a scientist can be hashtag beagle
feminism hashtag science
it's not it's not just we've paid
because scientists are researching ways
to fight human diseases using mice and
while scientists know how painstakingly
slow this kind of research is it is
tempting for the rest of us to start
racing ahead and wildly speculating
about where this is all going could
CRISPR give us unicorns so there are
examples of animals that have single
horns in the middle so like the
rhinoceros has one and its nose but
there are other ancient rhinoceros I
have it in the middle of the head so
anyway I think that you could get a
single horn on a horse by looking at
horns and other species so it's in the
realm of possibility yes okay so so I've
gotta say judging by all the hedging he
just did in that answer even if we do
one day career at a unicorn it's clearly
not going to be this majestic creature
who wants you to follow it into a magic
waterfall it'll be more like this a
monster that would beg please kill me
and this and this madness now in fact in
fact for a good sense of the mismatch
between expectation and current
capabilities just look at a project that
that scientist is working on right now
bringing back the woolly mammoth it has
been hyped in headlines all over the
world but they are nowhere close to
creating a living animal yet and even
computer simulations are underwhelming
in the lab they've edited about 35
functioning woolly mammoth genes into
the Asian elephant genome this is a good
start for making a semi woolly mammoth
yeah that's not a woolly mammoth oh
that's just a wrong elephant
it's not so much Jurassic Park as an
off-brand $3.00 petting zoo cause pet or
whatever but if you watch the news you
may have noticed that you're not just
seeing professional scientists and
that's because the underlying technology
of CRISPR is so cheap and widely
available almost anyone can use it so
gene editing stories almost always
feature a detour to meet bio hackers
like Josiah Zana here in the Bay Area
where visiting a bio hacker in his
garage he's selling CRISPR kids DIY
CRISPR kids for a couple of hundred
dollars you can buy this cutting edge
kit that allows you to use this
technology and you don't need anything
else you don't need a PhD and you could
do experiments with CRISPR like that I
think is really cool okay well sounds
revolutionary but to be fair selling
strangers things covered in unfamiliar
DNA out of your garage already has a
name and it's every single garage sale
in human history I would like to buy
your lamp please and then I'm going to
take it home and wash it and look he's
basically selling chemistry sets in the
extent that they get people excited
about science that's a good thing but
you can see why scientists get
frustrated when biohackers like designer
hog all the media attention especially
because he makes some pretty wild
statements like I want to live in a
world where people get drunk and instead
of giving themselves tattoos they're
like I'm drunk I'm going to crispr
myself which is a terrible idea
honestly you shouldn't even get drunk
and tattoo yourself however cool Robert
Duvall's face covering your midriff
seems at the time I'm just saying I have
some regrets
last October Xena even publicly injected
himself with DNA that had been modified
using CRISPR to try and give himself
bigger muscles which did not work but in
that same video he argued that using
CRISPR should ideally be like
downloading an app you don't have to
know what the app does how to program it
works anything like that and I think
that's the way it should be with genetic
engineering synthetic biology why can't
people use this technology without
necessarily completely knowing how it
works oh I can answer that one for you
because it could be dangerous and
someone could get hurt
also I refuse to take scientific insight
from someone shooting vertical footage
on an iPhone that is unforgivable that
is disqualifying immediately and now
says he regrets that experiment that
kind of behavior is a real worry for
serious scientists not just that a
biohacker will hurt themselves but that
doctors or scientists might rush a human
application before it's ready things go
wrong and the whole field is then set
back yes that is exactly what happened
to the field of gene therapy when a
patient named Jesse Gail singer died
during a poorly designed trial and
that's not the only thing that
scientists worry about because the
benefits and the drawbacks of gene
editing can extend well beyond one
person and to understand why it helps to
be familiar with a key distinction
somatic cells are most of the cells in
the body blood brain skin cells where
the DNA doesn't get passed down to
offspring germline edits involve sperm
eggs or embryos basically changing the
DNA of future generations
exactly somatic cells die with you
germline cells get passed down through
generations so much of what you've seen
so far tonight like baby Layla or Xena's
muscle experiment involved somatic cells
while germline cells are how my
great-grandfather passed this nose down
to me when he this bird great
grandma feathers
she loved bells germline editing could
potentially do incredible things take
malaria nearly half a million people
each year die from it and it's spread by
mosquitoes but gene editing could help
stop that through something called a
gene Drive scientists do this by
inserting an artificial gene into the
DNA of mosquito embryos that will make
an increasing proportion of female
offspring sterile the gene drive is
embedded in the DNA to ensure the
changes are inherited unlike natural
evolution where chance is involved
that's brilliant and it's honestly much
simpler than my idea to fight malaria by
just fitting millions of mosquitoes with
tiny condoms but but the moment you
cross into germline editing the
ramifications can seriously increase
because messing with any ecosystem can
have unintended consequences this has
always been true even before gene
editing and my favorite example of this
comes from Australia we're about a
hundred cane toads were introduced in
the 1930s to control the cane beetle for
the record they didn't do that what they
did do was multiply to hundreds of
millions of cane toads and wreak
absolute havoc Australians hate these
things there was even a documentary made
about them featuring a guy who made it
his life's work to run over as many as
he could well line them up with the
driver's side front wheel but I seem to
be able to get most of the ones I line
up on the right hand side of the road
well I really go out of my way to run
over cane toads basically because I have
a very profound love of the wildlife
that occurs here naturally if it was
possible to remove them and totally
eradicate
in Australia and I was capable of doing
it I would spend a lifetime doing
exactly there
Wow that guy is in for an unpleasant
surprise when he gets to the pearly
gates and finds out that God is an
Australian Kato so you'd like to get
into heaven huh why don't we go ahead
and take a look at the types the point
is ecosystems are very delicate which is
why you need to be extremely careful and
a good example of someone taking that
sort of care with gene-editing can be
seen in a project being considered on
Nantucket Island as a way to fight Lyme
disease you see Lyme disease is passed
from ticks to humans but before that can
happen
it goes from mice to ticks now typically
the way that works is like this and
mouse goes through a tough breakup it
was a relationship the mouse didn't want
to end and leaves it seriously
questioning itself worth the mouse mouse
goes on a series of rebound dates that
only deepen the disillusionment could
anyone love me the mouse wanders
despondent the mouse turns to alcohol to
numb the pain while drunk it comes
across a tinder profile of a tick first
then the mouse is disgusted but then
it's actually intrigued oh god it thinks
am I really going to a tick the
mouse goes on the date thinking it's
just a date we're just talking but the
mouse is lying to itself because as soon
as the tick says maybe we should go
someplace quiet where we can talk BAM
they're banging in the shower I dunno
afterwards the mouse feels strangely
satisfied it feels desirable again as
for the ticket can't wait to brag to its
friends that it just a mouse and
they both forget all about the encounter
until eight months later when the tick
gets a call bad news
you got Lyme disease and that is how
Lyme disease spreads from mice to ticks
sometimes other times the tick bites the
mouse anyway
the point it took to prevent the spread
of lung disease a biologist named Kevin
s belt is considering introducing
genetically edited mice that cannot pass
the disease to ticks and he would do
this with a ton of caution testing it on
an uninhabited island where the
experiment will be contained and it
would only go forward on Nantucket if he
got the buy-in of the local community
and even with all those safeguards he's
aware of the uncertainty although Kevin
s Pelt is confident his engineered mice
will only reduce Lyme disease and not
bring harm to Nantucket's ecosystem he
also knows that absolute certainty and
genetic engineering do not go together I
worry every day that I might be missing
something profound about the
consequences of what we're developing
good I'm glad you do because that is the
kind of caution that you want from
someone in his position he clearly
doesn't want to end up in a limerick
that goes there once was a man from
Nantucket who gathered some mice in the
bucket he altered those mice engineered
with a splice and now all of the
seagulls are dead and look there are
just practical considerations to
germline editing there are huge moral
questions too particularly when it comes
to humans because it raises the
possibility that gene editing could one
day be used not just to fight disease
but for so-called enhancement which
sells you into some pretty dicey
territory even Jennifer Doudna one of
the pioneers of CRISPR sees the danger
of this here she is telling the story of
a dream that she once had that was
pretty on the nose I walked into a room
and a colleague of mine said to me
Jennifer I'd like you to explain the
CRISPR technology to a friend and he
brought me into a room and the person
was sitting with their back to me and as
they turned around I realized was sort
of a horror horror that it was it was
Hitler and it was actually Hitler with a
sort of a pig nose and it almost looked
like a chimeric pig human sort of sort
of creature it's true she had a dream
about pink Hitler
wanting to learn more about CRISPR an
ethical reservations aside she might
also want to examine why her
subconscious thinks that one of her
colleagues is just casually friends with
Hitler
and look clearly the more control people
have over the ability to design their
children the bigger the moral questions
that raises up to and including who
decides what constitutes a genetic
problem that needs to be fixed is
deafness and disease many in the deaf
community would say it is not is
dwarfism a disease and he would say not
the idea that we're all sick that we're
suffering that I suffer from dwarfism no
I live with dwarfism
I've lived with dwarfism for 39 years
I'm proud to be a second-generation
raising a third generation of people
living with dwarfism
I don't suffer I suffer from how society
treats me exactly and there are many
groups who could justifiably worry that
the thing that makes them unique or
different could come to be seen as flaws
to be corrected and eugenics is a word
that rightly terrifies people it's why
it was such a mistake for Eugene Levy to
make that the title of his autobiography
it's a shame it's a shame it was a
lovely book as some great Catherine
O'Hara anecdotes were that that title
really dusted you off now here here is
the thing germline edited designer
CRISPR babies are still a distant
hypothetical no human has been born that
has had its germline edited yet and many
countries have bans or restrictions on
that but one place with very few
restrictions is China which in general
seems eager to push the limits of gene
editing and one of the scientists
working at that jack'd beagle lab seems
to brush off certain ethical issues the
CRISPR allows humans it puts so much
power into our hands it allows us to
shape our world in ways never before
imagined and there are many people in
the US who think well that's no that's
not for us to do that's that's for a
higher power that's for God alright so
the idea that we could
the role of God makes a lot of people
nervous mmm okay well that guy seems a
little bit blase about gene-editing
technology which is kind of surprising
in a country whose president as you may
remember from our show about China is a
honey eating talking bear that's the
resemblance is frightened I can't I
don't know which is which and look and
look my point here in showing you all of
this isn't to frighten you that there is
a lot to be legitimately excited about
here gene-editing has the potential to
alleviate a great deal of human
suffering but reaching that potential
will require careful time-consuming
research the science involved is much
more complicated than we've had time to
get into tonight mainly because we
needed to make space for that long story
about a tick your mouse and I
emphatically stand by that decision but
but well but while that research is
progressing we need to figure out how to
balance the risks and potential rewards
of gene editing which is going to be
tricky because everything that's being
done tends to get mixed together a
meticulous professional scientists with
freewheeling biohackers like this guy
practical applications with wild
theories best-case scenarios like ending
malaria with catastrophic prophecies of
30-foot wolves but but we are going to
let's talk about Mexico number seven on
the list of things that Donald Trump is
most frightened of just a head of
Muslims and just behind the concept of
self-reflection Mexico is a nation of a
hundred twenty three million people give
or take a few Americans spring break
douche bags like these to Cancun is the
hands-down best phasing and every spring
especially being a college kid give a
tip see then get drunk and then a little
bit of Yale on top of everything a lot
of it if you get tired here can't
confess for that so cool it's my
favorite part of that clip is that in
the corner it promotes something called
brain surgery life which I sincerely
hope is just a brain surgeon
lobotomizing these two bros but but
Mexico isn't just a tourist destination
we share a 1900 mile border and they're
our third largest trading partner and
something massive is about to take place
there it's going to be the biggest
election in Mexican history with
positions up for grabs from Mexico City
Mayor to congressional seats to the top
job itself it's true next Sunday we'll
see the biggest election in Mexico's
history which I know probably doesn't
mean much to most Americans it's like
saying the biggest mattress sale in
Dutch history or the biggest Mouse penis
in Portuguese history great that Mouse
is sort of hung how does this affect me
in any way but what this actually means
is that they could replace their
president their entire Congress and huge
chunks of their state and local
governments and many believe a major
shift may be about to take place there
because Mexicans are sick and tired of
the status quo their current president's
approval rating sunk as low as 12
percent last year and has become very
common for people to shout a particular
phrase at him your ability Rozier
opinion evaluate genius of DC matter
[Applause]
Wow go your mother is something
people only shout at you when they are
angry nobody shouts it because they
think you and your mother have great
chemistry that's never happened so
tonight let's look at why people are so
angry at Mexico's current president
Enrique Pena Nieto and who they are
considering to replace him and if we're
honest most Americans don't really know
much about him for instance that's not
Pena Nieto that's just what came up when
we talked Mexican man into a stock
English side but as long as he's here
let's give this guy a spin look at him
go
the man is absolutely leaving it all on
the field look just just so either just
so you know this this is the real pena
nieto although he is also so handsome he
actually resembles a stock photo model
he was swept into office in 2012 on a
wave of hype he made the cover of Time
magazine with the headline saving Mexico
and us coverage of his election was
breathless dashing 45 year-old former
governor is married to a famous Mexican
soap opera star wherever the couple went
they drew huge crowds especially women
who despite the fact peanin Nieto was
married couldn't get enough of him
calling him bonbon which means sweet
thing or hottie
the fact he admitted cheating twice on
his first wife and bearing two children
out of wedlock before she died of
epilepsy didn't seem to faze the adoring
crowd yeah all of that is true and that
would be completely unforgivable if he
wasn't so violently attractive how are
you gonna stay mad at that he is
visually Acula and Pena Nieto's
election was dramatic for a number of
reasons his party the Institutional
Revolutionary Party or Prix had
previously enjoyed a 71 year long era of
one-party rule in Mexico which only
ended in 2000 so real multiparty
democracy is very much a new thing there
and for many the hope was that painting
the 8'o would clean up the party's image
and restore it to glory but to put it
mildly that did not happen he himself
was implicated in a number of
serious scandals and on his watch not
only did corruption not improve it hit
such a fever pitch that visitors to
Mexico City could do this this is the
corrupt tour a 90 minute bus ride to the
seamier side of Mexican business and
politics on its itinerary ten city
landmarks where public money has
allegedly been diverted for private gain
it's true there were actually bust tools
of Mexico's most appalling landmarks and
I sincerely hope that that tour includes
Guillermo del Toro's two Oscars for the
shape of water guess what guess what I
was rooting for the fish man to die the
first man was gross and I didn't enjoy
watching him and anyone who did is
weird and wrong but but for sheer the
sheer scale of government corruption in
Mexico is hard to comprehend many many
politicians have close ties to cartels
and gangs at least 14 current or former
governors of Mexican states are under
investigation for corruption some of
them for colluding with organized crime
like Xavier Duarte he's the governor of
Veracruz on his watch the state was
bankrupted with nearly three billion
dollars missing from official coffers
he's been charged with racketeering and
using illegally obtained funds among
other things and what he denies those
charges it frankly didn't look great
that he fled the country in a helicopter
only to be tracked down and arrested and
by the way what is that smile then that
is not the face a grown man makes after
being arrested that is the face a
nine-year-old makes after urinating in a
public pool and this pervasive
corruption contributes to a sense of
impunity and diminished faith in cops or
courts violence has spiked in Mexico
with the country on track for 32,000
murders this year twice as many as in
2014 and yet only 2% of crimes in Mexico
get solved which may explain why these
two Yayo fiends didn't seem to put much
effort into their disguises
and for many the incident that
encapsulates all of this frustration
government corruption violence and a
serious lack of accountability is what
happened on painting the ATO's watch in
2014 43 students disappeared September
26th after boarding a bus to the town of
Iguala to raise money for an upcoming
trip
authorities say the mayor there feared
the students would disrupt an event for
his wife and had police stopped down the
officers opened fire and turned the
students over to a drug gang which
killed them and burned their bodies it
was horrific and incredibly it got worse
than that because there is evidence that
the federal police and military were
involved in the students disappearances
but the government did not pursue it and
when you hear all of that you can sort
of understand why so many people want to
tell painting the 8'o
kinga tu madre now now he is not running
for re-election as Mexico's presents are
limited to one term so who are his
potential replacements well there is
Jose Antonio Mead also from the
pre-party but he has no chance we're not
going to talk about him
there is also Jaime Rodriguez and
independent candidates and state
governor known as el Bronco he also has
no chance but we're very much going to
talk about him because he is a human
wrecking ball just just watch his idea
for stopping government corruption your
could okay we need to cut off the hand
of anyone who steals in the public
service you're not speaking literally
are you candidate yes of course
literally well explain to me please
anyone who steals must have his hand cut
off a bill must be presented so that
members of Congress approved this
penalty cut off the hand of the
criminals of course that is what you're
gonna propose in the Congress that's
right god what a writer gave him five
separate chances to say that he wasn't
being serious
and he just Bronco his way through all
five of them and chopping off somebody's
hand is a pretty drastic punishment for
political corruption although a perfect
way to eliminate contestants from my new
reality competition show America's next
top sock puppeteer
I'm sorry Flopsy bunny just didn't Wow
Anthony please place your hand on the
chopping block
but but that is not el Broncos boldest
position because he also has a firm and
unwavering hatred of Santa Claus
I don't believe in Santa Claus do you
believe in Santa Claus how many believe
in Santa Claus look at just three Santa
Claus is bad it's true el Bronco hates
Santa and if you think we are cherry
picking just one example of virulent
anti-semitism think again when did you
tell your kids there was no Santa Claus
every day every day yeah he tells his
children every day that Santa is not
real that is harsh that is so hot
hello boys and girls it's me Santa
sorry to interrupt Santa I can't believe
you're here this is fantastic yes I just
wanted to tell Mexican presidential
candidate el Bronco that I do exist I
bring magic to children all over the
world so that el Bronco is on my naughty
list now if you'll excuse me I must get
back to the North Pole Oh actually
central I've always wondered what do you
do up there all year when you're not
delivering presents why I masturbate
dear boy I masturbate all day and night
I ask to beta masturbate until my sack
full of presents is empty if you catch
my meaning why would you say that Santa
every day is Christmas for Santa when he
masturbates I even do it sometimes when
I'm flying on my big red sleigh I try
not to get any on the reindeer but even
Santa's not perfect this is so different
than what I thought meeting you would be
like yeah yeah no no I get that a lot
I'm not sure why I mean look at me I'm
very weird and I love to stroke it till
it looks like a candy cane
[Music]
the pointed the point is el Bronco is
not going to be the next Mexican
president the the candidate currently
polling second is this guy
Ricardo Anaya a 39 year old center-right
wonk he is known for delivering
twenty-minute policy presentations that
are somehow even more explainer II than
the ones on this show the yellow line
shows the behavior of manufacturing
employment in the United States now as
you can clearly see it remains steady
despite NAFTA right we get on one hand
that was extremely boring but at least
we now know what it would look like if
pitbull went to grad school now Kylie
this guy is a bit of a nerd although he
does desperately try to be cool because
he plays a bunch of musical instruments
he plays guitar he plays ukulele he
plays keyboard and the coolest
instrument of all the recorder that is
simply pathetic and it is not just me
saying that in Mexico that clip is
unleased what's been called a tsunami of
memes including videos where people swap
in different songs like this version of
Britney Spears toxic
[Music]
[Applause]
muy bien where he go or even muy bien
now now I know I did try and toughen his
image opportu in the campaign but he
struggled to stick the landing like when
he released this video ahead of a debate
what are you doing just hitting that
speed bag his teddy will impressive but
you then ruined it with that weird smile
at the end
he's like someone successfully pulling
the cloth from underneath a table
setting and then immediately pissing
their pants he was so close you
ruined it though but the outright
front-runner and the man widely expected
to win this election is Andres Manuel
Lopez Obrador a populist who often goes
by his initials am lo and he served as
mayor of Mexico City a building a
reputation as a man of the people
famously commuting to work in a Nissan
Sentra the vehicle rated by JD Power and
Associates this is actually amylose
third time running for president he lost
in 2006 and 2012 not taking that first
loss particularly well cuz not only did
he refuse to accept the results he held
a gigantic alternative inauguration
ceremony in Mexico City in which he was
sworn in with a fake sash and declared
himself the legitimate President of
Mexico his supporters occupied the city
central square for months and that is
ridiculous when Al Gore lost the 2000
election he didn't hold a fake
inauguration he just told us we were all
gonna die and it was our fault it was
it was just called basic good
sportsmanship
now look I'm lost campaign has caught
fire this time around because he has
tapped into populist anger he's promised
to help the poor and eradicate
corruption and he often rails against
the elites and the Mafia in power
oh why you have been sir okay so more he
Wireless Kalos political caucus solo
they see less hero Martha Corinne tan
your chant all of public yes Thank You
Moira
we are say Gila chant por la gente per
mil de por la gente he says he doesn't
look that sounds great and you can kind
of see the appeal there am low is kind
of like Bernie Sanders but with a better
haircut and significantly better Spanish
Washington Roscoe a goldman sachs ER
Wall Street they sue Barker otter
obviously think he could have carried a
hundred percent of the Hispanic vote if
his slogan had been vote for me and I
will never speak Spanish again am lows
goals may be clear but but the details
of how he plans to achieve them can be
pretty sketchy his opponents of attacked
him as a dangerous leftist but
journalists who've covered him say it's
hard to judge things based on his policy
platforms because they're prone to
change often seemingly overnight and
that he often makes big promises while
keeping his own advisers guessing as to
what he really means so in that way he's
actually more reminiscent of a Mexican
Donald Trump which I know is a weird
image to conjure up like Orthodox Hitler
or jacked Gandhi the two concepts don't
fit well together but but but the lack
of concrete policy hasn't dampened the
excitement around AMLO who supporters of
made some pretty striking ads for Garvey
salos politico's cortos campo bernardo
and Ostrow Pais get each other Mickey
Cohen a fabrica recoveries and
don't see holes and thicker than no
clean emir of seniors damn holy
that is the most terrifying Tiger I've
seen since the episode of Winnie the
Pooh where Tigger ate eel and was that
really so put their wild animals
Christopher Robin you can't just keep
them in your backyard it was bound to
happen sooner or later not a tragedy
that was inevitable but that that ad
actually becomes less fun when you
learned that it was made by the social
encounter party an evangelical Christian
party that opposes same-sex marriage
homosexuality and abortion that party is
in am Lowe's coalition which kind of
speaks to the fact that by being so
vague he can let people see what they
want to see in him so sure a Christian
conservative party can think that he's
on their side as can be presumably much
more liberal people behind this ad which
pitches am low as an aphrodisiac
paulien skip let's give away what our
poor undressed man we're just a meeting
is insidious most sexually explicit
campaign ad since Theodore Roosevelt's
famous slogan of teddy will make you
but the point here is what our hope in
AMLO is real the content is a question
mark and it says something about how
entrenched the problems in Mexico are
and the level of people's
dissatisfaction that they seemed so
willing to take a gamble on him and look
for much of this piece we've talked
about the problems in Mexico of which
there are many but that is what makes it
all the more impressive the people are
putting their lives on the line to solve
them there are journalists tackling
corruption despite the fact that Mexico
is the third deadliest country in the
world for them to work after Iraq and
Syria and there are honest politicians
running for office
even though 120 politicians including 44
candidates have been killed during this
campaign in the town of Piedras Negras
an anti cartel congressional candidate
was murdered just earlier this month but
but the mayor there is refusing to hide
we reached the current mayor of the
others named as Sonia via Reyes who says
her life was threatened just rude asses
no Tina still more of these are you
you're not fearing them no Wow porque
you are shocked even if it means risking
your life doesn't happen I mean that is
just amazing and and for the record I am
NOT that brave I am NOT that brave at
all sure oh took the drug cartels
from the safety of New York this this
produces the actual head of the Sinaloa
cartel and I'll happily say that he
looks like Andy Garcia won a pizza
eating contest cuz that guy
him I'm not scared of him but I wouldn't
have the courage to say that in Mexico
and
I wouldn't even have the courage to say
it here that's not the head of the
Sinaloa cartel
that's another stock photo do you think
I'm crazy the point here is
Mexico is on the verge of the biggest
election in their history with a chance
to combat endemic corruption that has
betrayed its people for far too long and
I sincerely hope the candidates they
choose at every level are worthy of the
trust that's about to be placed in them
because it's going to take brave bold
work to give that country to change it
needs Santa Claus is not coming to save
Mexico as we learn tonight that man is
very busy
don't do what vividly describe how I
bring myself to climax 364 days out of
the year I concur in my toy shop John I
fill my stocking I polish the North Pole
the elves taught me yoga and now I can
blow myself
you
China the country responsible for huge
technological advances and yet it still
can't seem to get pandas to china
is a gigantic and consequential country
where roughly one out of every five
people on earth live it is also the
place that trump has been ranting about
for years China is killing us what
China's doing to us is horrible China
cheats they devalue their currency we
can't continue to allow China to rape
our country and that's what they're
doing okay so even in the context of a
metaphor the word rape is pretty jarring
as verbs go it's not exactly bandied
about it's like if Trump said Congress
is really toe me on this border
wall the underlying point is clear what
he chose to express it that way is not
and yet for all that Trump talks about
China it seems that he's very much in
the process of learning about it just
watch what happened when microphones
picked up this exchange with China's
president during a state visit back in
November actually learned something
there rest assured the only thing you
took away from that conversation was
that Egypt is older and therefore less
 though China okay great note to
self don't a t' too old but the
truth Erie's a lot of us are probably
under informed about China and that's
something that its leaders have
historically been absolutely fine with
Deng Xiaoping famous we had a lay low
International Strategy summed up by the
same hide your strength and bide your
time but in recent years there has been
a significant shift regarding that
because when China's current leader Xi
Jingping
assumed the highest office in the land
he said this kumoi shock and awe that
China needs to learn more about the
world the world also needs to learn more
about China you know what he's right we
probably should talk more about China we
should probably have talked more about
it on this show especially considering
we've done roughly 4,000 different
stories on New Zealand and multiple
pieces on
testicle receptacle from the 2005
Russell Crowe film Cinderella man so so
tonight tonight let's talk about China
and let's put America aside for most of
this piece and talk instead about China
on its own terms because it's been going
through seismic social economic and
political changes which have happened
head-spinning Lee quickly and many of
them Center on its leader Xi Jinping who
just recently tightened his grip on
power
the most dramatic political change in
China in decades a vote to scrap term
limits for China's president the move
clears the way for Xi Jinping to stay in
power indefinitely and possibly for life
of nearly three thousand ballots only
two voted against the unprecedented move
three thousand to two which means after
that vote there were two members of
Chinese Parliament thinking whoopsy you
really thought that would go the other
way maybe an edible arrangement will
smooth things over with the man who's
now emperor for life and that followed
on the heels of what was arguably an
even bigger change the fact that last
October
she's political doctrine known as Xi
Jinping thought was enshrined in the
party's constitution and that may not
sound like much to you but it's roughly
the equivalent of Donald Trump making
himself a founding father and including
Donald Trump thought into the
Constitution which would mean that
historians in the future would have to
pass the meaning of while Bette Midler
is an extremely unattractive woman I
refuse to say that because I always
insist on being politically correct
and she's consolidation of power has
been aided by the fact that unlike many
of his predecessors who tended to be
dull bureaucrats he's gone out of his
way to form a cult of personality about
himself for a time state media called
him she Dada or uncle she both of which
are objectively weird names for an adult
to call another another adult but
fantastic names for a pair of hairless
cats see Dada uncle she dinner's ready
creepy weirdos
and she carefully presents eight
man-of-the-people image his origin story
is famous in China are born into an
elite family his father fell from grace
and like many during Mao's Cultural
Revolution she was sent to work in a
rural village a place which has now
become a tourist trap the smartly
dressed tour guide shows us where she
slept an old picture on the wall we see
a well he helped dig and a sewing shop
he set up old farmers who knew she back
then still roam about these pseudo
mascots of this Bazaar theme park yeah
that is a bazaar theme park and I'll say
that knowing full well that this
country's most beloved theme park
features vomit-inducing teacups and a
massive pantsless sailor duck with no
genitals and she's branding isn't
confined to tourist attractions state
media has also featured folksy moments
like this video of him ordering pork
buns at a Beijing restaurant now that
visit was huge news in China and that
could be hard to believe because our
politicians eat junk food in front of us
all the time you can find photos of 12
of the last 12 presidents shoving ice
cream into their faces it's actually
legitimately challenging to find a
single photo of Obama where he is not
about to inhale half a pint of vanilla I
didn't even remember that he'd been
demolishing a waffle cone during the bin
Laden raise but clearly I'd remembered
it wrong I was wrong but but the reasons
for Xi's popularity go beyond marketing
himself as a cuddly XI data that you can
grab a pork bun with because for
starters he is riding an economic wave
that long precedes him over the last 30
years China's GDP growth has averaged
nearly 10 percent a year making it the
fastest sustained expansion by a major
economy in history which has enabled
more than 800 million people to lift
themselves out of poverty and many in
China's growing middle class are pretty
content with how things have been going
the tremendous public optimism is
striking everyone is doing better than
their parents did in their day I think
we'll be able to move to a bigger house
within the next 5 years and I expect my
life to improve a lot whatever happens
I'm very optimistic about the future Wow
a sense of optimism about the future
I've got a say as a British person I
just find that utterly incomprehensible
if you look up optimism in the OED and
this is true the definition simply reads
no so for many in China
things are going undeniably well but she
has even greater ambitions and I'd like
to focus on two massive signature
projects one global and one domestic
first there's his so-called belt and
road initiative a plan which is
absolutely gigantic in scope basically
involves China spending a trillion
dollars on infrastructure projects in
more than 60 countries things like ports
bridges and roads with the idea that it
could eventually span international land
and sea routes and reshape global trade
with China at its center to hear China
tell it it is the most ambitious
infrastructure project in modern history
they've even produced an
english-language propaganda video to
tell the whole world about it
[Music]
okay if I could just if I could just
interrupt this irritating Old Navy
commercial Hawking a trillion dollar
infrastructure plan I know I know that
you're probably thinking right now if I
have to listen to one more second of
that it's going to be stuck in my head
all week well just be thankful that you
haven't heard the rap break until now I
can't take it anymore
either they basically made communist
kars4kids that is too early to say
whether the belt and road is going to be
a success but she's second bold project
has already seen results because he's
undertaken a massive crackdown on
political corruption a long-standing
grievance among Chinese citizens it's
led to the investigation and punishment
of hundreds of thousands of government
officials some at the very top of the
party and this has been widely
celebrated with the state media even
producing a crackdown themed computer
game the People's Daily a Communist
Party mouthpiece released a computer
game where users can give electric
shocks to corrupt officials what could
possibly be sinister about being invited
to electrocute prisoners in a
government-issued game that is the most
entertaining way to package something
disturbing since FDR smash-hit board
game Candyland just kidding it's a
japanese-american internment camp and
this this is where we reach the point of
the story that you're kind of knew was
coming because so far everything that
I've shown you is what she data wants
you to know about China but there is a
lot of troubling stuff under the surface
for instance conveniently for she some
of those swept up in the corruption
purge were his political rivals and
those accused were often funneled into a
system that's been described as a
secretive extra legal process where
interrogators seek to extract
confessions sometimes through torture
and it's worth knowing that those term
limits that he successfully eliminated
were put in place for a pretty good
reason specifically to avoid another
maou under whose regime some horrific
things happened in China from a
collectivized farming attempt that was
responsible for at least 45 million
deaths - a Cultural Revolution that was
estimated to have killed at least
another million - his belief that this
swimsuit was flattering which I realize
now that I say out loud really doesn't
belong with the other two in that list
the point the point here is she is
actively removing the post male
guardrails that were put in place and
while China has never exactly been known
as a haven for free expression
he has clamped down noticeably on any
form of dissent whatsoever there is
dissent online and China's censors are
working hard to quash it they
temporarily ban the use of phrases such
as personality cult and my Emperor and
also references to Winnie the Pooh a
character long used to mock Xi Jinping
based on an apparent resemblance
apparently Xi Jinping is very sensitive
about his perceived resemblance to
Winnie the Pope and I'm not even sure
it's that strong a resemblance to be
honest but the fact he's annoyed about
it means people will never stop bringing
it up trust me she if your face even
remotely resembles that of a beloved
cartoon character the smart move here is
to lean in and backing down on Winnie
the Pooh comparisons
doesn't exactly project strength it
suggests a weird insecurity in him and
experts say that she is deeply concerned
the public opinion will turn on him
China's economy is already slowing and
she's reportedly haunted by the specters
of the Arab Spring and the Soviet
Union's collapse and that paranoia
may be why he's so anxious to
micromanage Chinese daily life the
government has a list of untrustworthy
people which can restrict citizens
ability to travel buy a house or take
out loans and over the next few years
there are plans to take things much
farther every Chinese citizen is being
assigned a social credit score a
fluctuating rating based on a range of
behaviors it's believed their community
service
buying Chinese made products can raise
your score fraud tax evasion and smoking
and non-smoking areas can drop it
if a score gets too low a person can be
banned from buying plane and train
tickets real estate cars and even
high-speed Internet yeah you could be
cut off from a high-speed Internet
although that could actually be a huge
opportunity for the finest purveyors of
shitty low-speed Internet
I'm talking of course about AT&T as of
this week our parent company so goodbye
everyone it's been fun it gets much much
darker here in fact she's crackdown on
human rights he's apparently the most
intense since Tiananmen Square and that
is not good because Tiananmen Square is
on the short list of places so infamous
you don't even need to describe what
happened like Chernobyl or Jonestown or
that one Cheesecake Factory we can't go
to anymore and she has intensified
government suppression of certain
religions in one province
Christians have been told to take down
the image of Jesus and Hank portraits of
she instead something I've also done by
the way so yeah I think it really ties
the room together it's a nice accent
piece and a Muslim population known as
we guys have been singled out for
dystopian levels of surveillance and
persecution here is one man talking
about a form that the government had him
fill out this piece of paper was sent to
everyone people had to fill it out
they asked things like if you are weaker
if you have a job if you have a passport
if you pray all these answers were
turned into a scoring system they would
categorize people into safe regular and
unsafe people that's pretty chilling cuz
generally speaking whenever people are
placed on lists it's not really turned
out well for anyone involved many of
history's greatest monsters put people
on lists Nixon the Nazis Santa all of
these animals did that I looked sure
enough if you are deemed unsafe for
whatever reason you're in big trouble
because China has incarcerated Muslims
in reeducation camps with as many as
800,000 individuals in facilities which
reportedly
to rewire the political thinking of
detainees arrays their Islamic beliefs
and reshape their very identities making
uncle Shi less like your fun uncle and
more like your creepy uncle who
imprisons 800,000 people in his
basements and if you want to see what it
looks like when she's jumping thought
gets put into Xi Jingping practice just
just take the story of Nobel Peace Prize
winner huge elbow he was imprisoned in
2009 for writing a pro-democracy
manifesto and last summer he died in
state custody and even China seemed
concerned about how that might look
fearing domestic backlash government
censors went to work social media post
mentioning Liu's name were deleted
online searches with his name were
blocked even simple candle emojis were
deemed illegal on some sites CNN signal
in China has been cut by government
censors every time we mention his name
exactly the Chinese media wouldn't allow
mentions of a Nobel Peace Prize winners
name which is a pretty intense level of
censorship but it's also my personal
policy towards Guatemalan activists
Rigoberta menchú do not bring her up
around me she knows what she did you
know what you did Rigoberta you know
what you did I don't hear our name on
your lips that's not what this meetings
about
but the point is what it is what
happened to you she'll bo and his wife
who is still under house arrest is
absolutely tragic although to his credit
he didn't go down without taking a final
swing one of the last known photos of
Lee you was with his wife Lucia at first
glance unremarkable but notice the mugs
they're holding yep
that's really the true
good for that chuckling I think deep
down we all know when you need to really
tell someone to go themselves
why not do it with a mark what the hope
the whole point here is under Xi
Jingping China is becoming more
authoritarian just as it has major plans
for expansion onto the world stage so
the era of hide and bide is over and the
era of do as we say may be dawning
because China has significant economic
leverage and it has been using that to
silence criticism even when criticism is
very much warranted the European Union
hardly squeaks about human rights
anymore or certainly the British don't
you don't get much on Tibet either
because whenever anyone raises any of
these issues China turns around and says
do you want to do business or not of
course because China knows no matter how
badly they behave the world will still
want to do business with them they're
like Facebook oh I'm sorry you don't
like us mining your data and
undercutting your democracy what exactly
are you gonna do about it
male people printed out photos of your
meals you ate call your friends and tell
them happy birthday and out loud words I
don't think so go yourself
here is where having set America aside
at the start we should bring it back in
because it is arguably more important
than ever than America be strategic and
tactical about how to deal with China
sadly those qualities are not hallmarks
of this guy who couldn't play chess for
longer than 29 seconds without screaming
my horse eats your big lady and pouring
nacho cheese all over the board
Trump is blowing up the traditional
alliances that have helped influence
Chinese behavior on important issues and
that has been great news for Xi Jinping
as has the fact that human rights don't
really seem to be a big trump priority
in fact just hours after the death of
you gel polo
even has it as his administration issued
condolences Trump himself said this
president she is a terrific guy I like
being with him a lot and he's a very
special person Wow
that was not the best time to give Xi
Jinping a pat on the back it's the
equivalent of saying how much you love
Kevin Spacey in American Beauty right
now first you shouldn't it was
objectively terrible and second you're
picking the worst possible time to bring
that up
the point is Trump is leaving a vacuum
on the world stage and China is more
than happy to fill it by telling the
world its story and leaving out some
very important details so for everyone's
benefit if they're going to send out
cuddly propaganda videos about Xi
Jinping at his achievements someone
might want to make a companion piece the
kind of rounds out the picture
[Music]
[Applause]
taina bandung now it's growing big enjoy
let's learn about it now in this
annoying hum they have a president so
call him uncle she bunny can with
you instead
[Music]
he'll add a shield for you
[Music]
you
[Applause]
[Music]
we thought we'd update you on the
ongoing Trump administration scandals
that we've been calling stupid Watergate
a scandal potentially on the scale of
Watergate but where everyone involved is
dumb and terrible and bad at everything
now last month marks the one-year
anniversary of the murder investigation
or as the president and his supporters
call it Robert Muller's illegitimate
runaway which on it is and it has been
from the beginning a witch-hunt this is
a witch-hunt this is a witch-hunt
basically a witch-hunt though witch-hunt
if you will it's a damn witch hunt yes
they've been derisive ly referring to
the Miller investigation as a witch hunt
which is a little ironic because you
just know if Giuliani Hannity and Trump
had been alive back when people burned
witches they'd have had front-row seats
toasting marshmallows while trying to
conceal their bonus now it's also a
strange claim considering that mullahs
team has in the past year charged 20
people and three companies and gathered
five guilty pleas so if this is a witch
hunt witches exist meaning we should
probably change all references on our
history books to 16th century witch
hunts to read that time we were right to
murder all those teenage girls in a lake
and the fact the investigation has been
moving fast is good news because set
aside for right now how you feel about
Trump or politics the question did a
hostile foreign government trying to
manipulate our election is something any
reasonable person should want answered
quickly and yet an increasing number of
Americans seem to want the investigation
to stop last July
support for investigation stood at 62%
but a recent poll found it's now down to
just 54 percent and that is troubling
because remember Trump was actually
considered shut in the investigation
down before and if that number keeps
dropping he may well feel empowered to
try and actually do it so tonight let's
talk about the Muller investigation not
about its contents because we don't know
what they are yet but about the effort
to actively undermine it not just from
Trump and his lawyers but from and more
importantly than you might think
Trump's TV friends specifically pumpkin
Dada captain Virgin bad judge whiter
megyn kelly the dunce bust the dunce
bust junior for presidents and of course
Michael Cohen client number three Sean
Hannity and
voted most by nana nice new
glasses magazine and if you think it
will hold on I don't watch Fox News I
tune all of that stuff out it's actually
important that you know what's been
happening on it for reasons that and I
cannot believe I'm saying this Rudy
Giuliani explained best because when he
was recently asked why he was going
around spouting unsubstantiated nonsense
he offered this explanation eventually
the decision here is going to be
impeached not impeach members of
Congress Democrat and Republican are
going to be informed a lot by their
constituents so our jury
is me as it should be is the American
people you know what he's right he's
related by blood to his first wife but
he is right because because it is the
long-standing view of the Justice
Department that you cannot indict a
sitting president so to the extent that
Trump can be held accountable it's gonna
be through impeachment where public
opinion is key basically when Giuliani
goes on TV he's arguing to the jury and
that is us and I know you're probably
thinking right now
jury duty time to act like a racist
idiot to get out of it well that is not
a disqualifier this time not by a
longshot
so with that in mind let's look at a few
techniques that they've been using to
influence public opinion and the first
involves attempting to redefine the
investigation on their terms because
whenever they discuss it it's inevitably
framed like this Muller is there to show
collusion between Russia and Trump and
there's none so far so why not end it
where is any evidence of collusion show
us nothing so far
not a whiff there is zero evidence of
Russia collusion so just so we're clear
everyone forwards conclusion collusion
no illusion delusion yes I just thought
we'd have some fun with words oh well we
didn't we didn't have fun with words
there all we did was witness the closest
anyone in the Trump administration has
ever come to making or hearing rap music
but it is important to remember Muller
wasn't tasked with finding proof of
collusion the word collusion doesn't
even appear in his appointment letter in
actuality he was tasked with looking
into links and coordination between the
Russian government and anyone associated
with the Trump campaign as well as any
matters that
rose or may arise directly from the
investigation that's a pretty broad
mandate so saying the investigation has
to shut down if there's no collusion is
like saying a game of Scrabble has to
end because you fit all the letters in
your mouth well congratulations but
those aren't really the rules that we
agreed to and that is far from the only
diversionary tactic here there's also
what about ISM now we talked about this
on the show before it's the practice of
shifting the debate to someone else's
wrongdoing the master of this is Sean
Hannity and he responds to any negative
news about Trump with epic rounds of the
what about game we have a two-tier
justice system what about fired FBI
director James Comey what about Bruce
and Nellie or what about anti Trump
lovebirds struck in Paige what about
lying Susan Rice what about Christopher
steal the foreign national that fusion
GPS hired and funneled the money Hillary
did through the law firm and a foreign
national about Russian lies to influence
the American people in an election what
about who lied to the FISA Court judges
that is a lot of names to throw up on a
screen and just say what about them it's
also a little easy as an argument I'll
prove it
hey Sean have you thought about these 15
people what about them what about
Archduke Ferdinand Shawn
what about cher we're not talking about
the FBI until you answer what about cher
Shawn now and it is point there is that
other people did bad things
so therefore Trump's bad things don't
count and look let me be clear on this
whether or not someone else did
something shitty has no bearing over
whether you did something shitty if that
were true every movie that got a bad
review could simply say what about from
Justin to Kelly and the critic would be
legally required to give them movie five
stars that what about ism is an
important part of the third tactic on
display here building a
counter-narrative essentially trying to
delegitimize the investigation by
framing it as part of a grand conspiracy
to bring down trump kennedy has a series
of carry from homeland ease off her meds
conspiracy boards with muller and
clinton as the head of two different
crime families and whatever the is
happening on this one
night after night Hannity paints a
picture where the investigation is
itself one gigantic scandal with the
Democrats the FBI the deep state and
establishment Republicans teaming up to
take down Trump and he's got a favorite
phrase to convey its scope this is
bigger than Watergate
that's like watergate's like stealing a
Snickers bar makes Watergate look look
like stealing a Snickers
this makes Watergate like stealing a
Snickers bar that's just an odd number
of mentions for Snickers considering it
doesn't sponsor Hannity show presumably
Snickers simply couldn't hang with big
hitters like his actual advertisers my
pillow recta care cream and of course
sock slider it's true take a look you
scream you scream you're so far away
just bending over to put on your socks
is brutally painful every day we'll not
anymore introducing sock slider the pain
breed no bend over way to comfortably
put on your socks every day waiting for
someone to invent a gadget that I can
preload with a sock condom and then
thought my way to comfort everyone
unsurprisingly Hannity's narratives tend
to fall apart pretty quickly take two of
the names on his family feud board Peter
struck and Lisa Paige they are FBI
agents who worked on the investigations
into both Hillary and Trump and the key
thing you learn about them if you follow
conservative media at all is that they
were making sex at each other did these
two cheating lovebirds who are still
married as other people at the time have
any opportunity to actually do their
jobs at the FBI there she is
FBI love bird Lisa Paige Peter struck
and is in office fellow FBI agent and
secret lover
Lisa Paige Peter struck who along with
his girl mod Lisa Paige another FBI
lawyer are getting off in their fight to
save the country of Donald Trump oh yeah
they were
they were doing the nasty doing the slam
bam in the ham stuffing the muffin
fishing for kippers they were poking
them in 44 and piecing them in 52 they
slid the wand into the Goblet of Fire
they were dining at the all you can bong
buffet at pjo parkington's they were
having an affair and in doing that in
having that affair they apparently
relied on FBI work phones to hide it
from one of their spouses which is
undeniably bad judgment plus texts like
these made it clear that they very much
preferred a Hillary presidency to a
Trump on which is a political opinion
they're entitle to as long as it doesn't
affect their work at all and the DOJ is
looking into that question right now but
Robert Mueller himself didn't wait he
removed struck from the investigation
immediately when he learned about the
text and Paige had already left so these
two people haven't been part of this
investigation for nearly a year now and
the Wall Street Journal read these 7,000
messages between them and found that
they show no evidence of a conspiracy
against Trump and just for a moment
spare a thought for the reporter who had
to read 7,000 sets between two horny FBI
agents that's not why they got into the
game but Hannity still brings up
striking page all the time as just two
of the many threads in this elaborate
counter narrative his latest obsession
is something called spy gate the
inaccurate claim that the FBI planted a
mole in the Trump campaign now here is
what the spy gate story is actually
based on as part of the effort to
investigate Russia's meddling in the
election FBI agents sent an informant to
talk to two Trump campaign advisers who
have suspicious contacts linked to
Russia that's it that is the whole thing
but here is how their theory is
Republican congressman trey Gowdy who
you may remember let a more than
two-year inquiry into Benghazi so he's
someone who is no stranger to digging
for dirt on Hillary even he says this is
nonsense you believe the FBI acted
properly in this matter based on what I
have seen I don't know what the FBI
could have done or should have done
other than run out a lead that someone
loosely connected with the campaign was
making assertions about Russia I would
think you would want the FBI to find out
whether or not
there was any validity to what those
people were saying right he's saying the
FBI did what they were supposed to do
and the headline FBI investigates
possible crime it's like the headline
Domino's delivers pizza or
harley-davidson sells midlifecrisis
'mobile to local dad yep no kidding
that's their whole reason for existence
and yet rather than accept that push
back some Trump supporters turned on
Gaudi instead I'm naming names here I'm
through with it I mean trey gowdy is
really schizophrenic he he is absolutely
in the service of the establishment and
and the deep state where they're
intentionally consciously or
purposefully he is exactly that and
that's the problem
anyone who questions the conspiracy
becomes part of the conspiracy itself
and for the record the only thing that
is completely schizophrenic about trey
Gowdy is his hairstyle over the years I
mean what exactly is happening here look
Trey Trey my friend when you are born
with bad hair just pick a look and stay
with it trust me man
I am an expert on this the point here is
this machine is now running so
aggressively that even evidence can't
slow it down
and if you want more proof of that just
watch Hannity actively admit it in real
time no evidence of Trump Russia
collusion Muller if you got it come on
the show and tell America and by the way
if the media if you have more proof that
this is not a witch hunt okay I don't
believe you Wow give me facts and even
if you do I won't believe them he's
basically bragging that he's proof proof
which is a superpower that no one should
want to have like the ability to throw a
baby a hundred yards with a perfect
spiral sure it's technically impressive
but maybe don't do it and all this can
make it easy to forget just how bad what
we actually do know already is just as
one example
we know that in 2016 Don junior
knowingly set up a meeting in Trump
Tower with a person described to him as
a Russian government attorney with the
promise that the person would provide
information that would incriminate
Hillary and her dealings with Russia as
part of Russia and it's government
supports for mr. Trump and we
oh this not because of the Malheur
investigation or because there was a spy
in the campaign or because these two
fuck-buddies teamed up to frame anyone
we know it because Don jr. tweeted out
the emails setting up the meeting ahead
of a newspaper publishing them so that
story's just a fact and one that looks
very bad for Trump but if you think
Hannity isn't up to the challenge of
deflecting that one as well
just watch him go to work remember the
now-infamous
2016 trump tower meeting between Donald
Trump jr. Russian lawyer a Russian
American lobbyist and a few others oh we
have new information recently unearthed
a transcript from a 2017 Senate hearing
that the Russian American lobbyists
admitted to personally knowing Hillary
Clinton so let me get this one straight
you seem to be employing Hillary Clinton
sent someone in to Trump Tower to offer
her opponent dirt on herself
you know what congratulations Sean
Hannity you have officially come up with
the shittiest conspiracy theory ever and
none of this even addresses the most
obvious question if absolutely everyone
from Hillary to the FBI to tri-county
was in on a deep state plan to sabotage
Trump how the is he president right
now basically everyone in the country
got together to steal an election and
then for some reason forgot to do it and
look we could pick apart conspiracies
all nights but there is really at the
end of the day no point because they'll
always be another rabbit hole a
metaphorical rabbit hole that is not to
be confused with the rabbit hole the gay
club where years ago a young Marlon
bundo finally allowed his curiosity to
overpower shyness
[Applause]
really special himself but creating
rabbit holes is kind of the point here
because I would argue the Hannity Trump
and all the rest aren't really
interested in getting to the bottom of
any of these questions they're just
trying to sow enough doubt that this
number dips far enough below 50% to
enable the whole investigation to be
shut down they are just working the jury
and if you've seen any focus groups on
TV you know that at least some jurors
are really listening they call the first
by created by the deeps team it was a
witch-hunt to overturning election all
of this stuff that they say that Trump
did they're finding out that the
Democrats did it's been going on for a
year and a half they've found nothing
where he told oh there's something
there's something we'll find a bull
fighter
there's nothing exactly in this piece
we've argued that the taxes that you've
seen tonight are transparent illogical
and dumb but the other thing they
definitely are is depressingly effective
and the thing is these tactics have
worked in the past quite famously in
fact think about it
a sociopathic misogynist millionaire
evolved from celebrity to undeserving
folk hero suddenly has evidence piling
up that he may have done something
terrible and he puts the whole system on
trial if that sounds familiar at all to
you it's because it's basically the
story of OJ all over again Trump is
going full o je and it's working now
what does it mean to go full o je well
at once sense it means to murder two
people but but it also means to sway a
jury by building a wild implausible
conspiracy that the system is corrupted
the reason haniss he throws out so many
theories may well be that he knows if he
can discredit any part of mullahs
investigation he convinced people the
whole thing is a total sham and that is
the same angle that OJ's lawyers took
just listen to one of them tried to
discredit all evidence because of doubts
that he'd raised over a blood-soaked
sock
if they manufactured evidence on the
sock how can you trust anything else and
the jury bought that although I will say
I also do have questions over how police
got their hands on those socks because
the sock slider hadn't even been
invented back
it's impossible and sure sure there are
differences between the two defenses the
OJ trial had if it doesn't fit you must
acquit we have collusion delusion
conclusion illusion which if anything is
even dumber and look I am NOT saying
that Trump is guilty we honestly don't
know but even if the mullet
investigation doesn't prove that Trump
personally colluded with the Russians
that doesn't mean the whole thing was a
witch-hunt or a waste of time the
process of finding out is really
important and it needs to be seen
through to its conclusion and my fear
right now is that we are headed in a
direction where even if Muller comes
back with irrefutable evidence trunk
could just pardon himself and put out a
book called if I did it and a very large
portion of the country would buy
it
you
senior citizen to the people who stay
active by playing shuffleboard going on
walks or performing their hit song I
can't get no satisfaction in front of
packed arenas around the world many
senior citizens remain active and
independent like this woman who CNN
interviewed when she was a hundred and
four and who shared her secret for good
health
are you drinking dr. pepper right now
she's exactly what this stuff is good
it's got sugar in it and three two
doctors have told me that if I drink it
I will die but they died first did you
kill those two doctors cause he seemed
awfully proud of that fact I'm not
saying that you did it I'm just saying
serial killers always want recognition
for their crimes now we currently have a
lot of senior citizens right now over 49
million Americans are 65 and older and
that number is expected to sharply
increase in a democratic surge that some
have called the silver tsunami which is
also apparently the nickname that
Christopher Plummer goes by and his
underground cage fighting ring he's 57
and oh if you get caught in the silver
tsunamis Floria fists you're waking up
in the hospital but the truth is not
everyone is going to remain as sharp and
self-sufficient in their old age as that
murderer laughing at her dead doctors
unavoidably some of us are going to wind
up needing extra care and that could
place as an assistant called
guardianship and I'll let a Maryland
judge explain it to you as a camera
pushes relentlessly into his face a
guardian is someone appointed by the
court who act on behalf of an individual
who is under a mental or physical
disability and as a result is unable to
make responsible decisions about his or
her care or property he's right and you
should know that zoom wasn't actually
planned the cameraman was just so taken
by the judges animal magnetism he
couldn't resist moving in closer and
closer the phone was shot was just the
camera pressed up against his mustache
but the fact the fact is guardianship is
an important valuable tool and here is
how it works basically let's say an
elderly person who lives alone is
showing signs of dementia any concerns
person could petition the court which
might decide to appoint a guardian to
help them make important decisions that
Guardian could be a family member or if
there is no family or if the families
fighting the court might appoint a
private Guardian a professional who is
paid to manage their affairs and when
this system works it's great but it
probably won't surprise you that that is
not what this story is about that's
simply not what we do on I just wanted
to watch a comedy show and go to sleep
but now I'm sad with Johnny joy killing
because because let me show you what can
happen when guardianship goes wrong take
the case of Rudy and Rennie North they
were living together happily in Las
Vegas when one day there was a knock on
their door and not let Rudy take it from
here so I opened door and they said that
they were officers of the court Rudy
says the officers gave the couple three
options one we call the police
- we have you go to a psychiatric ward
choice 3 an assisted living facility
well that is three terrible options
there it's like playing marry kill
with the chipmunks none of them none of
that from any other I'll kill myself I'm
taking the easy way out but but it is
true there was a knock on the North's
door and they were suddenly moved to a
facility by a woman they had never met
before who was given control of them by
a judge who they had also never met and
by the time they got out from under that
Guardians control two years later most
of their money was gone something that
Rudy is still understandably furious
about they're strippers they strip your
clothes they strip everything from you
we have nothing left no money no assets
nothing
nothing left and you know what I really
feel for him although I also must defend
strippers here because they get rid of
their own clothes not somebody else's
because somebody walks around getting
rid of other people's clothes is either
a criminal or tan France from the reboot
of queer
so so tonight let's talk about our
system of guardianship and the first
thing you should know is that far more
people are under it than you may think
one study estimated the figure to be
around 1.3 million people and and the
next thing you should know is that
guardians can have a huge amount of
power over people under their care or
their wards now because they may have to
make financial and health decisions they
can have access to everything from wards
bank accounts to their health records
and as for the wards themselves they can
lose a lot of their rights from being
able to vote in elections to being able
to get married so this is no small thing
as one judge who Awards guardianship
will tell you guardianship is a massive
intrusion into a person's life they lose
a lot of rights in fact they lose more
rights than someone who goes to prison
less rights than someone in prison that
is pretty shocking basically the only
things that you do have the right to do
in prison are sleep eat workout and
occasionally play backgammon with Phil
Spector he's he's really good at it it's
all he does now he's finished with the
killing that was that was just a phase
for Phil and the fact that Guardians
gained control of their wards finances
is where things can get problematic
because private guardians can bill for
each individual service they provide
from leaving voice messages to just
opening the mail and it can take payment
directly out of their Ward's estate and
those charges can accumulate fast and
sometimes seem ridiculous for instance
the family of a woman named Marie long
objected to her Guardians taking her on
a weirdly expensive outing just look at
what Sun Valley charged morita sent her
and their worker to a Phoenix Suns
basketball game over $1,000 for research
phone calls a limo Sun Valley even
charged Marie 228 dollars to determine
the effect of the game on her mood
exactly they charged her 228 dollars to
figure out how a Phoenix Suns game
affected her mood which is absurd
because I'll tell you that for free it
was a Phoenix Suns game it made her sad
try it yourself go to a game and see if
it improves your mood to see dragon
bender put up four points and one and a
half rebounds
spoiler alert it won't and I went Rudy
and Reni's Guardian a woman named April
parks was confronted over some of what
she charged them for she didn't exactly
stand her ground Rudy and Reni were
charged seven hundred eighty dollars
each for court filings and travel time
to court on the same days in 2013
that's over fifteen hundred dollars
you're absolutely right couple you're
absolutely right who you're saying
doesn't even have enough money already
will happily reverse those out those
charges out how about $108 parks charged
ready to buy her a pair of stretch pants
does 108 bucks for stretch pants no it
doesn't and and I'm happy to reverse
that yep but you can't just do a bunch
of shitty things and then say I'll
reverse it this is someone's life not a
 Missy Elliott song although in
fairness you do probably need good
stretch pants if you're going to put
your thing down flip it and reverse it
the only ones who had questions about
April parks is bully practices she had
up to 800 wards at a single time and in
a court case involving a different Ward
a curious fact emerged parks was a
no-show in court but her voice was heard
through her own financial records which
are almost laughable some days were over
a hundred hours of billing that's not
physically possible yeah a hundred hours
a day is not physically possible unless
she was working on the planet Mercury
whereas we all know each day last 1400
and 7 earth hours I'll be honest that's
a joke exclusively designed for Neil
deGrasse Tyson so I do hope you enjoyed
it dr. Tarr think is absolutely nobody
else it actually out of interest
did you enjoy yeah but the time you gave
was the rotation rate of mercury that's
not the same thing as a day a day on
Mercury would be from sunrise to sunrise
of course and on Mercury that lasts
three times longer than what you just
gave
shut up Neil shut up what drive to ruin
everything
just enjoy something for once in your
 life what is wrong with you you
feckless
I'll never mind it's not working it's
not working
bad idea boxes Cavalier approach through
her wards continued even after some of
them died because when this guy this guy
here bought a storage unit at auction
you will never guess what he found 27
urns 27 sets of different ashes some a
few years old others from the early
2000s somebody had the gall to store a
family member in a storage unit like
that that's somebody according to Valley
funeral home directors was this woman
April Parkes it's true she just left
earns full of other people's family
members in a storage unit and the only
way that could have been in worse taste
was if she poured them into a pinata for
a nine year olds birthday party
happy birthday Matthew knives of fun age
now now Parks was eventually arrested
not for the urn thing by the way which
was completely legal and she is
currently facing trial on over 200
felony charges including racketeering
theft exploitation and perjury but
you're probably wondering well how did
she even get so many wards in the first
place why didn't the Federal Bureau of
Guardian oversight step in to stop her
well that's mainly because that agency
doesn't exist we just made it up and the
fact that one of the symbols on that
logo was just Harvey Keitel's face
should have really been a giveaway for
you the fact is though guardianship is
the responsibility of state and local
courts meeting in most places everything
about it from who becomes one to who
they oversee to what they can charge is
up to local judges who may be elected
and may have no legal training for
instance in much of Texas guardianship
decisions are made by county judges and
only 29 of the judges in those 211
counties are lawyers the rest as one
judge put it off farmers car dealers and
insurance salesmen and those courts can
be so overworked they do not have the
resources to monitor cases properly when
Texas recently audited their
guardianship they found that over 3,000
wards had died without the court knowing
and are they alive or dead is the
absolutely least you should know about
someone under your care if a zookeeper
didn't know that 3,000 of his animals
were dead you'd put someone else in
charge of that Zoo or the very
least rebranded as an open-air exotic
meat market and on top of all this only
12 states require professional Guardians
to be certified at all so just about
anyone can become one and when the
Government Accountability Office looked
into this a few years ago their findings
were truly troubling most jobs handling
even small amounts of cash requires some
sort of criminal background check and or
a credit check
but the GAO found in most cases
guardians for the elderly can handle
millions of dollars and states have
failed to require either and it's like
putting the you know Fox and chicken
coop basically and of course they're
going to steal money exactly although I
will say not every Fox is out to steal
from you that's just an offensive
stereotype based on Swiper from Dora the
Explorer it's not all Fox's hash tag not
all foxes actually you know now I'm
looking at this that also says note all
foxes but I do agree with that as well
at all fox would be very very scary and
awareness must be raised hashtag denote
all foxes and all of these lack of
oversight is worrying in a system that
can be easy to fall into and very
difficult to get out of remember it took
Rudy and Renny nearly two years to get
out from under April parks and it was
not easy
although luckily for them Rudy was
pretty determined we're going to pursue
it all their way and we're going for
their balls just so they know it's their
balls where you want okay okay that's
fine
Rudi's seems determined and he also
seems like the first person in human
history actually interested in balls
because generally balls are to the human
body what stars is to a cable package it
comes with it we understand that but
it's not nice to look at and nobody
really knows what to do with it and
again okay I am NOT saying that
guardianship as a system is inherently
bad there are people who need it and
there are going to be more of them as
the silver tsunami approaches but that
is all the more reason for us to improve
its checks and balances from greater
regulation to more funding for oversight
and on the personal level there are
steps that everyone can take to avoid
being taken advantage of in the future
most experts tell us it is important to
have honest conversations with your
family and I know that sounds like a
 nightmare but where you have to
have these conversations about about how
you want to you and your finances to be
taken care of should the need arise that
will help prevent a court from having to
step in and appointing a private
Guardian that could turn out to be an
April Parkes plus there are some
concrete legal steps that you can take
and I know that if you're a little older
you may not want to hear advice from a
fresh-faced holy-shit is he really only
41 year old so so we've we've actually
enlisted some help to get the message
across look we all get old eventually
it's just part of life and someday you
will too obviously you won't age as well
as us we're glamorous celebrities with
access to skin care technology but won't
be on the market for decades
look how supple my cheeks are you might
not age at all you might die tonight
young by getting hit by lightening or
eating too many Tide Pods or getting
killed by a hippo
that's actually a lot more likely than
you think they kill hundreds of people
each year oh you think they're cute oh
they're killing machines
hippos are terrible but we're not here
to talk about hippos
I am meet you I love hippos what do you
need we're not talking about hippos I
thought this was a whole hippo thing
getting older can mean needing someone
to help look after you and your affairs
you should make sure that that's someone
you know and not some random person
you've never met who just wants to spend
all your money on stretch pants
that's why it's important to select
someone to serve as your health care
representative and someone who can make
decisions for you under a durable power
of attorney named people you trust like
your son or daughter Oh close friend or
mr. Tom Hanks Tom Hanks is the best it's
a nice boy Jimmy Stewart would have been
my go-to guy but that was in the past
just make sure they're people you'd be
comfortable with making financial or
health decisions on your behalf I hereby
make Tom Hanks mr. Tom Jefferson Hanks
my health care representative if
clipboard I felt they signed yours truly
done I remember to always share these
documents with your friends and family
and discuss your plans so everyone's on
the same page and even if this feels far
off you've got to start planning for the
future now now now now now also hippos
are killing machines that's the real
message here hippos hippos
 hippos what is wrong with you
people
you
you
rehab the most common place to go after
hitting rock bottom
other than Dave & Buster's don't let
their smiles fool you every one of those
men is at the lowest point in their
lives in that photo
now rehab is a place where people can
address an addiction to drugs or alcohol
something that until relatively recently
was seen as a moral failing that could
be overcome with sheer willpower perhaps
best epitomized by this amazing PSA from
the 80s
starring singer Belinda Carlisle I used
to do drugs and one morning I woke up I
looked in the mirror and I said you look
frightening I got sick of it so I quit
and now the beach rat now incidentally
Belinda Carlisle has since admitted that
after that PSA was shot she used cocaine
for another 20 years to a point where
and I'm quoting her directly here I'm
surprised I still have a nose which is
the kind of statement you only normally
hear from toddlers who just spent the
afternoon with their uncle he he told me
he got it did his fingers and I
flipped man I was crying screaming the
whole thing I'm surprised too still
after those right no thankfully
thankfully there is now a broader
understanding that addiction is complex
and that nothing about getting off
alcohol or drugs is easy experts now
view addiction as a medical problem
often lock into a disease or a chronic
condition and a common way of treating
it is through stints in rehab
it is a thirty-five billion dollar
industry with over 14 thousand rehab
facilities across the United States some
of which have fancy names like promises
or passages or milestones you know names
that sound like perfumes worn
exclusively by widows and some rehabs
can even afford to run TV commercials
like this cliffside Malibu has been
helping people just like you for over 12
years
except most insurance our experienced
compassionate staff will help you get
your life back call the number or go to
the site below now don't wait because
your tomorrow may never come wow that is
a hard turn there
that's like frosted flakes ending a
commercial with Tony the Tiger getting
shot by poachers now now in recent years
it has gotten easier to get insurance to
pay for rehab that's largely thanks to
the fact that george w bush passed and
Barack Obama expanded laws requiring
health insurers to increase coverage for
its but while we use rehab as a
shorthand it is worth knowing that there
is no set definition for what it should
consist of in fact there are no federal
standards for counseling practices all
rehab programs and while many really
halves are staffed by people doing their
best to help a report a few years ago
found that the vast majority of people
in need of addiction treatment do not
receive anything that approximates
evidence-based care and for a sense of
just how bad things can be look at
Florida a state whose rehab industry has
seen an epidemic of overdose deaths and
fraud to the point where one local
official issued a chilling warning the
clear message would be stop sending your
loved ones to South Florida because
we're sending them back in body bags
holy that is the worst
and yet possibly most honest tourism
slogan for Florida I've ever heard come
to South Florida we'll send you home in
a body bag so tonight let's look at what
rehab is and why the industry so
troubled and let's begin with the fact
that rehab should never be seen as a
quick fix it's often just the first step
in a lifetime of recovery yet many
operators make huge claims about their
success rate take passages in Malibu the
father and son who run it make some
pretty big promises about what they can
do for you when you send patients home
what do you say to them you're cured
totally cured 100% you will never use
drugs and alcohol again right your
dependency has been cured have a
wonderful life
for a start there is no way when
patients leave this doesn't say
ciao
there is no way that sound
doesn't come out of his lips but it's
not just passages lots of rehabs feel
free to make suspiciously impressive
claims as one researcher found out we
called inpatient programs and ask them
what their success rate was and the
lowest rate we got quoted was 80% you
know I do know that about 80% of clients
who have come in here are now sober long
term we've had about an 80% success rate
here at 180 and then we would ask and
one what data do you base that and no
one had any data they had no hard data
to back up their claims and at that
point why even stop at 80% why not say
you have a one hundred and forty percent
success rate for every ten people that
come into our facility 14 emerge
completely sober where did those extra
four people come from we have no idea
that's how good we are and that's the
thing rehab success rates are often
based on self-reported statistics
involving them simply calling former
clients and those results can be
problematic as a man who's participated
in one of those studies can tell you
they call you up and they ask how you
doing and you just lie you know
fine you know I was drinking yeah I mean
it's it's crazy you know but I was
embarrassed to say you know I didn't say
sober I mean kind of understand that for
every reason it can be hard to admit
that you've relapsed plus it's a phone
call so you'll say whatever it takes to
make it end because getting sober may be
hard but nothing is harder than an
8-minute phone call with another human
being nothing nothing at all and look
for all those claims of success it is
very hard to know exactly what you're
getting at any given rehab you might get
the traditional 12-step based approach
which undoubtedly works for some
although most experts argue that there
should also be consistent access to
other newer treatments like certain
behavioral therapies or medications like
these but rehabs are not required to
offer those and because a rehab can
essentially be whatever
it's proprietor says it is that means
they can frame almost anything as
treatment for instance many high-end
rehabs offer something called equine
therapy and again if people respond to
that that's great but there is no
empirical evidence that as a treatment
for addiction it works which means some
people who paid a high price for it can
end up having this experience they had
like the whole equine thing I mean you
go and pet horses what is
petting horses gonna do for me
let me do two a goddamn thing I don't
even like horses okay so first
of all I absolutely love that guy second
of all he's completely right horses can
go straight to hell why do we even need
them anymore
I'm sure you could ride one somewhere or
you could just drive the car which is
like a horse except it can play music
and it doesn't constantly
everywhere you're an idiot patches an
idiot now one of the places one of the
places that offers a coin therapy is
cliffside the place from the ad that you
saw earlier now a month of treatment
there cost tens of thousands of dollars
and its founder Richard Tate gets a
little defensive when asked if it's
worth that price
listen seventy three thousand dollars
sounds like a lot of money but if you go
to the Four Seasons for thirty days okay
that's gonna be forty grand right okay
what did you get
was there any life-changing thing going
on there everything that we've done here
is mindful it only seems like horse
to people that don't know better but you
don't have to know better bro because
your life didn't depend on it
you didn't go through it okay calm down
bro besides you being a little unfair to
the Four Seasons plenty of life-changing
things happen there just last year Jaden
Smith claimed that the one in Toronto
spiked his pancakes with cheese after
kicking him out of his room and if a
handful of Canadians tricking into an
addicted Charles millionaire with
undisclosed ricotta isn't a
life-changing thing I guess I don't know
what is anymore and $73,000 first 30
days does sound like a lot of money
because it is a lot of money and you
would hope that at cliffside they could
account for every moment of treatment at
price but that does not seem to be the
case where your where your patients at
today I don't know where are they
where'd they go no you're not Bub's here
I have no idea I have no idea okay no
idea do they they probably went to
whatever they did there's a therapeutic
meaning behind it good site bro
because you were in trouble for a minute
there
but the therapeutic meaning line was
absolutely inspired because the truth is
anything can have a therapeutic meaning
his patients are stroking horses that
could be therapeutic they're biting owls
that could be therapeutic
even the act of them being lost could be
therapeutic
it's called inadvertent wilderness
therapy and it's a hundred and forty
percent successful
look so far we've just talked about the
fancy high-end residential facilities
but there are oversight problems
throughout this system because in many
states the barriers are opening a rehab
can be dangerously low for example in
Idaho as long as you are not operating a
residential program for adolescents you
don't need a license at all in
California as long as you take private
pay clients anyone can start an
outpatient rehab center and in Florida
if you want to open a sober home a group
home where people stay often while they
receive outpatient treatment there is
nothing in state law to stop you
technically oj simpson could open one
right now which would obviously be
called the juice cleanse and there would
be nothing standing in his way and
florida actually provides a window into
how the flood of insurance money into
treatment centers has caused massive
problems because the industry boomed
there and unscrupulous operators have
found it way too easy to gain the system
take urine testing insurance covers drug
tests and some places have exploited
that arranging for kickbacks from
testing facilities basically meaning the
more you're in they take the more money
they make and it adds up fast for a
single thirty dollar store-bought urine
test you could get up to five
$1,800 in payouts from insurance
companies so let's do the math if you
run five tests a week on a single addict
that's seventy five hundred dollars six
addicts at five tests a week $45,000
that's over 2.3 million a year exactly
urine is so valuable that in the
recovery industry it is known as liquid
gold and peeing liquid gold
sounds like the symptom of an STD you
can only contract from c-3po no
see I don't think all women born after
1990 have it anyway unless you're
sleeping with all women born after 1990
see are you are you doing that see
you're a dog see you're a metal dog and
with money like that to be made just
from urine it is hardly surprising that
some operators have gone to extreme
lengths to attract patients with
insurance even engaging in something
called patient brokering or junkie
hunting here is how that works
Mercedes Smith the recovering addict
herself told us sober home operators
compete for addicts with good insurance
enticing them with promises of free rent
free food free cigarettes we would have
to drive around Delray and anybody with
like suitcases we would have to ask them
do you have insurance
any place we can go okay so in terms of
questions to ask people from the window
of a moving vehicle do you have
insurance is barely less sinister than
would you like some candy or what size
of flesh are you
and it gets even grimmer because the
truth is there can be more money in a
patient relapsing than in them
recovering so at its worst
this system encourages a cycle of
admission relapse readmission and
relapse again this cycle even has its
own special term it's called the Florida
shuffle and if you are not extremely
lucky this is how it ends
in the Florida shuffle you go in and out
of recovery in and out of rehab centers
in and out of sober homes milking the
individual for their insurance until
that person dies yeah the Florida
shuffle turns out to be horrific and not
as I'd assumed a party where everyone
throws their keys in a bowl and gets to
go home and their neighbors
alligator and if at this point you're
thinking well I guess I just need to be
extra careful when I'm looking for
treatments well that is the final big
problem here because it can be nearly
impossible to find good unbiased
information let's say you're sitting at
home and you see this ad which plays a
lot we are the addiction Network and if
you have a problem with drugs or alcohol
you need to call the number on your
screen now addiction is a disease and
you can't go it alone the call is free
and so is the consultation so why
haven't you called why haven't you
called that is a hostile tone that you
would not tolerate elsewhere Tampax
tampons why isn't one in you right now
seriously
explain yourself but the important thing
to understand is that the addiction
network is not a rehab it is a referrals
business meaning they make money by
routing your call to centers all over
the country which reportedly paid them
forty to fifty dollars for your call so
in a moment of crisis your individual
circumstances are not being taken into
account
they're simply placing your fate in the
hands of whoever has $50 which is a
terrible system I have $50 but I have no
idea how to treat someone with an
addiction I'll probably just give them a
copy of my handmade anti-drug pamphlet
titled napping with the devil please
stop doing heroin
and if you're thinking now well hold on
I wouldn't fall for a sketchy looking TV
ad or I'd do my own research that is
great but let's say that you saw that
cliffside ad and you thought well that
looks good but I do want to check it
myself first well a Google search will
quickly land you on rehab reviews calm
which says that cliffside is the choice
for those that have to have the finest
of everything or you might land on the
de fix comm a whose review of cliffside
raves that it is a great choice for
anyone who has the means to recover
their what you probably won't see on
either of these websites at least not
unless you know exactly where to look is
that both of them are actually owned by
Richard Tate the founder of cliffside
Malibu you remember the guy who looks
like Matt Lauer a pair of oakley
sunglasses and that fact that fact the
fact of ownership certainly casts some
doubt or on the fact that the fix
awarded cliff side a rating of five out
of five stars presumably one star for
every ten patients whose location he's
completely unaware of and let's say
someone you love was truly in crisis and
you wanted information on cliff side
from an outside source like what
complaints had been lodged with the
states and what the state found when
they investigated well in order to get
that information you would need to file
a public records request with
California's Department of Health Care
Services and then wait four months for
them to send you what could be a huge
pile of documents to sort through and
that is too long to wait for urgent
information it's akin to a pregnancy
test that takes you eight and a half
months to get the results that is
practically useless and a huge waste of
perfectly good urine which as I now
understand it is liquid gold
everything about this industry is
incredibly difficult to navigate which
is dangerous because even one of its own
trade groups its own trade groups has
warned that some sectors of it are out
of control and for a sense of just how
helpless you can be in the face of all
this just listen to Tom McLellan he was
Obama's deputy drug czar
you would think that if anyone knows
this world it would be him well guess
what I had become an expert in the
addiction field and then my son became
addicted and I had no idea what to do
all that training all that knowledge
about addiction did not prepare me for
the most fundamental question of all
where do you send your kid for treatment
it's true even the nation's deputy drug
czar couldn't confidently navigate this
system and the tragedy is his son died
and remember the funny guy who hated
horses he died too so this is a matter
of life and death and if you if you're
wondering what experts would advise you
to do in seeking treatments many that we
spoke to suggested beginning not with a
rehab which may try and sell you on its
own services but with a doctor who is
board certified in addiction medicine
now it's only recently become an
official specialty so there just aren't
many of them around but you can find
those that do exist at this website here
they may be able to guide you toward a
treatment that best suits your needs
which might well not be a fancy center
where you have to pay seventy three
thousand dollars to have this guy lose
you look look this system clearly badly
needs more expertise and oversight and
until then it may be really important
for all of us to understand that at
present the word rehab is so broadly
defined as to be close to meaningless it
is honestly barely better defined than
the word building and and if someone
were to tell you I have a drug problem
but don't worry I'm going to building in
Florida you would naturally say hold on
what's building where did you find this
building what's happening inside it is
it a hospital or a hooters
or both is it is it a hoot spittle what
what what's the proof that it works and
watch the doctor to horse ratio like in
there
and sadly right now it can be way too
difficult to get answers to those
questions which is crazy because so much
about battling addiction is really hard
getting clean is hard staying clean is
hard but getting good evidence-based
trustworthy help should be the
easy part and right now it is way too
easy to literally wind up pissing money
up a wall
you
[Music]
we thought we'd check in on the latest
developments in the ongoing Trump
scandals that we've been calling stupid
Watergate a story with all the gravity
of Watergate if during it there was a
gas leak in the White House and Nixon
had been really into huffing glue well
well this week stupid Watergate had
another plot twist thanks to Rudy
Giuliani who only joined Trump's legal
team two weeks ago but on Wednesday made
big news during an appearance on Fox
basically Trump is on record denying
knowing about a $130,000 payment to
stormy Daniels to keep quiet about their
alleged affair but despite that for some
reason Giuliani Trump's lawyer now
remember offered a whole new story about
where the money came from that even
startled Sean Hannity I'm giving you a
fact now that you don't know it's not
campaign money no campaign finance
violation so they funneled it through
the law firm funnel throw of him and the
president repaid it oh I didn't know
that he did yeah there's no campaign
finance law zero zero
he not only contradicting what his
client said he topped it off with the
drunk sounding zero of a man saying my
girlfriend left me but guess how many
 this guy gives zero now now in
saying that Giuliani may have just
exposed Trump to multiple new legal and
political problems but he wasn't done
because during his media blitz he also
undercut the White House's official line
on why James Comey was fired prematurely
announced the release of American
hostages from North Korea something that
as of this taping has still not happened
and made this creepy comment about what
would happen if prosecutors targeted
Trump's daughter I think I would get on
get on my charger and go right into the
writers their offices with a lance if
they go after Ivanka thought about her
son-in-law they've talked about him I
guess I Gerald is a fine man you know
that but men are you know disposable but
a fine woman like Ivanka come on
okay setting aside the sleaziness of
calling Ivanka a fine woman let's not
forget that he also just called a living
human being
disposable which is pretty harsh but
also it is Jared you know it's Jared he
is basically a six foot three inch stack
of packing peanuts it's Jared he's
useless now no Giuliani's interview was
so ill-advised and chaotic it left many
people on TV wondering what exactly had
become of him it's a long way from
America's mayor after 9/11 there's
something awful Giuliani yeah this is
not the time absolutely I mean this is
shocking coming from somebody who was
the post 9/11 mayor of New York City
after 9/11 I think Giuliani had a ton of
credibility with the American people
over this past week it seems like that's
kind of all worn off exactly people seem
to be as shocked at finding out who
Giuliani really is as a child at Disney
World who accidentally saw Mickey Mouse
pull off his head to reveal that he was
actually tilda swinton not only are you
not what I thought you are a moment ago
you are terrifying and if any
part of you is also wondering what on
earth happened to Rudy Giuliani tonight
we're going to try and answer that for
you because the short answer is nothing
he's always been this way and I know
that that might be a little jarring to
hear because the thing that he's most
famous for is being mayor of New York
City on 9/11 after which he was rightly
celebrated for being a calm steady
presence he was TIME's Person of the
Year he received an honorary knighthood
from Great Britain and its closest
American equivalent being played in a
made-for-tv movie by mr. James Woods
Democrats always talked about things
getting better Republicans did whatever
they could to make them better
that's what we're here for
[Music]
hot right right I mean come on who
wouldn't want to watch James Woods and
the lady from Kindergarten Cop trade
Republican themes pillow talk on a green
screen beach before exchanging the most
sexless kiss in the history of film how
did that not win all of the awards but
to truly understand Giuliani you have to
go back before 9/11 now he first made a
name for himself as a federal prosecutor
where he had quite a deep and lasting
taste for the limelight performing
stunts like going undercover to buy
crack while dressed in a Hells Angels
vest and a white dress shirt which made
him look less like a street junkie and
more like the third best member of an
all dad blues band called dad to the
bone now he eventually decided to run
for mayor which was somewhat risky at
the time due to some substantial baggage
an internal document produced by his own
campaign flagged a weirdness factor
around him because and this is true his
first marriage was to his second cousin
that's right America's mayor was a cosna
slur but-but-but don't worry don't worry
because he had an excuse for that
Giuliani says they only discovered their
family relation after many years of
marriage Oh didn't think it was
just a little bit weird at the wedding
ceremony when one side of the church was
both families and the other was just one
very nervous photographer who didn't
take a single picture now nevertheless
Giuliani was elected and and as mayor he
continued his love of the cameras
showing up everywhere from the Whoopi
Goldberg movie Eddy to an episode of Law
& Order to Bill Cosby CBS sitcom which
has not dated badly in any shape or form
but what many New Yorkers remember most
about the Giuliani is was his
unrelentingly abrasive personal style
he had a weekly local radio show where
he would take calls from constituents
which should be easy to do you just
listen to their concerns and you
politely disagree whenever necessary but
just listen to this exchange with a
ferret owner annoyed by the city's ban
on owning them as pets there's something
deranged about you you excessive
concern that you have for ferrets is
something you should examine with a
therapist this conversation is over
David thank you this excessive concern
with little weasels is the sickness
that's right
that is the mayor of New York actively
choosing to insult a New Yorker whose
only crime was being a fan of ferrets
and I am sure that when that ferret fan
was given the chance to present his side
without interruption
he was completely reasonable David
thanks for coming on thank you very much
you have in your hands my notes here say
one ferret is named master Linus Van
Pelt
and the other Princess Katie mini mitts
and that's it I hate to say it but
I think I'm on Giuliani side I'm on Team
Giuliani it turns out that ferret
advocates are a lot like ferrets I
thought I'd like them then I saw one and
now I'm not so sure but it went well
beyond picking fights with ferrets
enthusiasts because Giuliani adopted a
famously tough-on-crime stance with a
severely increased police presence and
an aggressive crackdown on so-called
quality of life crimes like panhandling
and jaywalking now this approach
antagonized a lot of people especially
people of color many remember it as a
time when the police were licensed to do
whatever they wanted a criticism even
shared by some former cops we will get a
lot of flack oh you're just doing this
because Giuliani is letting you do this
and in my heart I knew it was true if
police officers were just every single
person I want to stop you I'm gonna
question you I'm gonna frisk you then
the civil rights are gone and that is
pretty chilling because it's not like
it's easy to navigate New York streets
anyway at worst you're trying to get
around 14 Belgian tourists so don't know
how to walk in a city and at
best you might be ambushed by Billy
Eichner and if you are not up on your
Meryl Streep trivia you deserve
everything he's about to give you
now now by the end of Giuliani second
term many New Yorkers were sick of his
 at one point he even had to
move out of the mayor's residence and
made accusations of an extramarital
affair which he handled in the worst
possible way
Giuliani told the media in an
extraordinary news conference that he
intended to separate from the first lady
we've grown grown to live independent
and separate lives he'd given no
heads-up to his wife Wow Wow that is
just about the most humiliating way
possible to end a marriage other than
announcing publicly whoopsie i boned my
cousin but but then of course 9/11
happened and all was forgotten because
as America's mayor his reputation was
suddenly solid-gold
and upon leaving office he immediately
cashed in he wrote a book he gave
speeches making as much as $200,000 a
pop and he launched a consulting firm
called Giuliani Partners a name that
sounds a lot like a euphemism for
cousins who oh oh then there
Giuliani partners it was it was love at
first sight at that great grandmother's
funeral
naina always was a matchmaker now he
also became a partner in a law firm and
over the years his firm's represented
clients such as a tobacco company a
private prison company Bank of America
News Corp on Fox News and Purdue Pharma
the company that got in trouble for
supercharging the opioid crisis
basically the condom companies whose
logos you'd expect to see on an as car
driven by a homicidal grizzly bear and
then in 2007 Giuliani lost what was
supposed to be his destiny a campaign
for president which was catastrophic ly
bad he talked non-stop about 9/11 with
some supporters even holding 8 $9 and 11
cents per person fundraiser all of which
triggered this memorable line from been
candidate Joe Biden during a debate Rudy
Giuliani there's three there's only
three things he mentioned in a sentence
and now in a verb in 911 I mean there's
nothing else
now he's right Giuliani could not stop
leveraging 911 for his own ends as
evidenced by his classic children's book
one fish two fish red fish 911 now in
the end his campaign flamed out
spectacularly he did not win a single
state and he went from the front-runner
for the presidency to being out of the
race by January having spent around
fifty million dollars or to end up with
precisely zero delegates or as he would
put it zero
exactly exactly busy
and after that completely humiliating
presidential flop Giuliani ended up
fading from view
eventually washing up in d-list places
like this
[Music]
ENC mark we posted by rudy guiliani
holy that is a steep fall just ten
years after being named time Person of
the Year Giuliani was doing VJ work for
a cable networks editing for television
presentation of Scarface just think
about how crazy that is
that would be like if in ten years from
now Bravo announced a fuckboys of the
90s marathon hosted by Malala yousafzai
how the did that happen what did I
miss
clearly a significant amount of goodwill
has somehow been squandered Wow Wow
after that after that Giuliani fretted
away years as I rent a quote pundit on
cable news saying various awful things
and he didn't truly join Trump's orbit
until January 2017 when he was named
Trump's cybersecurity advisor
now why did Trump give him that job who
knows and maybe it was because Giuliani
had a security consulting business
called Giuliani security and safety
despite seemingly having no real
background in cybersecurity and if he
watched Giuliani for even 10 seconds you
do really get the sense that he tries to
check his email by opening a word doc
and typing hi Google check email thanks
Rudy although the truth is Trump's real
affection for Giuliani probably came
from his willingness during the campaign
to lend his last shreds of credibility
to various amounts of poisonous nonsense
like this if I did one tenth of what
Hillary Clinton did I'd be in jail she
paid people to create violence at his
rallies she sold 20% of our uranium to
Russia I have eight times online since
January in which she's had massive
coughing fits so go online and put down
Hillary Clinton illness take a look at
the videos for yourself now obviously
that is all horseshit but I do agree
with him on one point there you should
definitely go online and visit Hillary
Clinton illness calm and take a look at
the videos because they are i opening
and the reason I know that is we bought
the URL for
automatically redirect to something that
Rudy Rudy Guiliani would hate this
animation of to fair it's
awesome also it is worth noting stop it
also it is worth noting that Giuliani
security and despite Giuliani's
cybersecurity expertise didn't seem to
think to buy the URL Giuliani - security
calm so we now own that as well the only
thing that irritates more than two
ferrets two ferrets or cousins
not I mean the sexual tension
there is unbearable you know each other
so well and when you look at all of this
in total you realize that Giuliani's
role as Trump's lawyer isn't an
aberration everything in his life has
led to this point and while he may well
be providing terrible legal
representation for Trump he's actually
the most honest representation of him in
general because think about it they're
basically two versions of the same
person they're both New Yorkers coasting
on their reputations they both had three
marriages neither of them can shut up
when in front of a camera and perhaps
most importantly they both want to
Ivanka which which is weird for Trump
because Ivanka is in his family and is
weird for Giuliani because she isn't so
what happens what happened to Giuliani
is really not the right question he's
always been like this what's going to
happen to him is more to the point
because he is now the public face of
Trump's legal team and who knows what
he's gonna come up that maybe he Prem's
Trump down through sheer incompetence
maybe he gets fired in the next two
weeks although to be honest at the rate
we're going he is so fatally flawed as a
human being that he's probably going to
end up president although although to do
that he'll need a campaign website which
he might find difficult because for the
record Rudy Giuliani 2020 for calm is no
longer available because we bought it
and it links to a dancing ferret giving
you the thing
you
you
diplomacy the thing that keeps us from
immediately going to war with our
enemies and from telling Lichtenstein
how we really feel
you are a snobby polyp on Switzerland
and they should have you removed
immediately it is a busy time for
diplomacy in the Trump White House what
we've done planning the North Korea
summit weighing what to do about Syria
and a state visit with Makran next week
none of which is helped by the fact that
no one has seen Jared in months where is
Jared how can we make crucial foreign
policy decisions without the White
House's goodest boy and on top of all
that there's actually a massive decision
that Trump has to make just around the
corner the Iran deal is coming up
after months of will he won't he read
her it the nuclear deal is on the
president's mind once again this week as
he faces a May 12th deadline to decide
whether to recertify it there's a
growing consensus that this time around
it may finally be dead once and for all
well that is not a good sign for the
Iran deal because whenever there is a
will he won't he question regarding
Trump you can pretty much guarantee that
he will pick the worst possible option
will he pull the u.s. out of the Paris
Accord he did will he try and ban
Muslims from entering the country he did
when he looked directly into the Sun
during the solar eclipse while pointing
at it as if to say look the Sun he did
of course he did of course he did that
and Trump has made it very clear how he
feels about the Iran deal he's called it
terrible a catastrophe stupid insane
incompetent really sad horrible
horrendous horrible horrible terrible
incompetent and one of the dumbest and
most dangerous misjudgments ever which
is coincidentally also exactly what
Trump writes in Don Junior's birthday
card every year is appropriate and and
those criticisms are just the tip of a
very large iceberg I think it's maybe
the worst deal I've ever seen I think
it's the worst deal I've ever seen
negotiated my number one priority is to
dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran
this is the worst deal we got nothing we
got nothing they have so out negotiated
our people because our people have
babies they have no idea what they're
doing they will find out that if I win
we're not babies there's no more being
babies anymore oh that's right Iran
there's no more
being babies anymore we're done wearing
pull-ups and going tinkle in our Oshkosh
we can put our own store in our Juice
box thank you very much because we are
big boys and we have shoes with laces
and also a bike that has spider-man on
it that our uncle Jim got us for
Christmas because we are big boys and
there's no more being babies anymore no
more look make make no mistake this deal
dying could have huge lasting
consequences which makes it a little odd
that nobody is really paying much
attention to the fact that on May 12th
if Trump doesn't feel like this deal has
been fixed to his liking he may refuse
to waive a key sanction which could
threaten the entire thing so tonight
let's look at the Iran deal what it is
why Trump hates it so much and what's
likely to happen if he kills him to
start it probably would help to know
just a little of the history between the
u.s. and Iran which has been fraught to
put it mildly
here is a ludicrously brief recap in
1953 the CIA helped orchestrate a coup
to depose Iran's democratically elected
prime minister replacing him with the
Shah who was friendly to the US and to
whom funny story we supplied weapons and
a nuclear reactor the Shah was
overthrown in a revolution in 1979 and
dozens of American diplomats were held
hostage eventually the Ayatollah
Khomeini took power converting the
country to an Islamic theocracy that is
in an insulting ly brief history of the
last 60 years alone and there is a lot
that I've left out there but if you do
want to learn more just subscribe to my
new podcast talking Tehran with John
Oliver and james van der beek is just a
small taste of it let's pick up where we
left off with the privatization of
state-owned enterprises in Iran you're
talking about the work of Rafsanjani no
no I'm not talking about that John you
do this every time I'm talking
about the underappreciated roles of
moderates like Nettie buzzer oh please
find a big thumping on again about
moderates like Mac D buzzer gunshots
erection they never thought they
deserved raphson Johnnie was a glory
I'll tell you we got the backing of
moderates he was nothing you should
agree we need an ad for MailChimp right
now okay okay
John do you send a lot of mass emails
it's a pretty good podcast it's pretty
good and and look if you didn't know
that james Van Der Beek was an expert in
Iranian history expand your expectations
of what people are capable
but the point is in many Americans Minds
Iran's image is now reduced to a place
where US flags are set on fire and
whether a chance of death to America and
the truth is that is still part of
Iranian political culture much of the
power in the country is held by
conservative clerics who forced
religious compliance at home and pursue
an aggressive foreign policy abroad they
are widely believed to be supporting the
Houthi rebels in Yemen and Bashar
al-assad in Syria and are a major funder
of the terrorist group Hezbollah and the
current Ayatollah is still saying stuff
like this and sure I love the tall fury
by God's favor and grace nothing called
the Zionist regime will exist in the
region by twenty five years from now
okay so it's not the most important part
there but the country's name is Israel
not the Zionist regime if you're gonna
make appalling threats against a nation
at least get their name right I'm sure
that you would not like it if I called
Iran holds papac Harmony's palace of
Persians would you know you wouldn't
like it you wouldn't like it at all but
the truth is that is only part of the
picture of Iran there's also a large
educated relatively liberal middle class
among whom opinions of America tend to
be considerably more positive you can
see it in the fact that they have
knockoffs of American restaurants
they're called mash Donald's ZFC and
pizza hats which are obviously direct
ripoffs of marsh Donald's zfg and pizza
how and Iran's current president Hassan
rouhani is relatively moderate by
Iranian standards even going so far as
to tweet a few years back I wish all
Jews especially Iranian Jews a blessed
Rosh Hashana and when an Iranian leader
begins a statement with the words I wish
all Jews and actually sticks the landing
you kind of have to hand it to him there
and pro-western views are particularly
pronounced among young people born after
the Revolution in fact a few years back
Thrasher Magazine my favorite skateboard
magazine did a story on Iranian
skateboarding culture which has thrived
despite one considerable obstacle Iran
as under sanctions right now and it's
really hard for them to impor
thing from the West this kind of put the
skaters in a position where they were
actually forced to figure out a way to
make their own words we saw one kids
getting a board made of solid steel
which is kind of crazy it's an Iranian
skateboard it's made of metal sick deck
bra although if it was me I'd double up
on the grip tape on my top sheet so we
don't slam gonna go sketchy on the nose
grind I do hope you enjoyed that joke
because it took one of my writers 50
 minutes on the skateboarding
Wikipedia page to research it but that's
true but don't those sanctions actually
want one of the reasons that the Iran
deal happened in the first place because
after the international community
discovered that Iran was secretly
building up a nuclear program it was
understandably concerned and imposed
crippling sanctions affecting every part
of Iran's economy from oil to plane
parts to banking and investment one key
motivator in Iran coming to the table to
negotiate was relaxing some of those
sanctions and they got that all the
partners in this deal the US Britain
France Germany the EU Russia and China
agreed to lift specific sanctions on
Iran so that's what Iran got out of this
deal I guess the question is what did we
get and the answer to that is quite a
lot it requires Iran not to enrich
uranium to weapons-grade for 15 years to
reduce its number of operating nuclear
centrifuges from 19,000 to just over
5,000 and to increase the time it would
take to make a bomb from a few months to
a year it's true and those would be
concessions from Iran the deal required
them to reduce their stockpile of
uranium by 98% and mandated that they
would not enrich uranium above three
point six seven percent which is
significantly lower than the 90% needed
for weapons and try to make a bomb at
under four percent enrichment is like
trying to get drunk off a single can of
PBR you can't it cannot be done there's
no way to do it not unless
you're a gerbil and even then only if
you're drinking on an empty stomach
and look that that's not all the deal
also had strict conditions for
monitoring and verification to make sure
that they were in compliance and if they
weren't we could snap those sanctions
back it was a pretty good deal and yet
many felt it was too generous to Iran
Benjamin Netanyahu called it a bad
mistake of historic proportions and here
in the u.s. there was a hard opposition
with ads like this
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
Wow
that is a hostile way to make your point
there is only one ad that you could
completely justify being interrupted by
a nuclear explosion and it is this one
[Music]
[Applause]
good I'm glad those children are dead
but but for all the talk over here about
Iran getting everything they wanted you
should know that Iranian hardliners were
furious arguing that they had given up
way too much Iran's lead negotiator was
this guy javad zarif and some chilling
cell phone footage emerged of him being
confronted by a member of the iranian
parliament and just listened to what was
said to him if Isis comes to our country
you will be the first to take the blow
that is both scary and honestly not
really consistent with how Isis operates
they generally don't come to a country
and say okay nobody dies until we find
that first guy nobody kills anyone until
that first guy takes the first blow we
do this in order or we don't do it at
all where Isis
let's not come off like crazy people but
but despite all that opposition on both
sides the deal was signed which was a
huge achievement or as Donald Trump
would put it a complete disaster I've
studied this issue in great detail I
would say actually greater by far than
anybody else believe me
Oh believe me and it's a bad deal
okay so let's be absolutely clear here
Donald Trump has never studied anything
in great detail if you asked him what
color his wife's eyes are he would say
34d but firm so so what specifically
does Trump think is wrong with this deal
well he has a number of complaints and
the first has to do with monitoring
their nuclear facilities in terms of you
know surveillance they have the right to
self inspect how about that or their
major the most dangerous they can self
inspect okay so that's just not true
they cannot self inspect the deal allows
for regular monitoring of all declared
nuclear sites one of which even has
24-hour video surveillance and it's done
by the International Atomic Energy
Agency the UN's nuclear watchdog which
has already confirmed ten successive
times that Iran is complying with the
deal and fun fact if Iran complies just
once more they win a free meal at Pizza
hat so that's just an extra little fun
incentive for them to stay in line and
that is not the only thing that Trump
gets wrong about the deals inspection
process how about this
we see something wrong or we think
there's something wrong so we have to
wait 24 days before we go in but before
the 24 days start there's a whole
procedure so who knows how long it could
be could be six months okay so what he's
talking about there is the fact that
while again inspectors have constant
access to their declared sites they also
get access to any other site military or
civilian where they suspect undeclared
nuclear activity now Iran can push back
on those suspicions but once the IAEA
demands access Iran has just 24 days max
to let them in and it is a pretty tall
order to completely clean up every trace
of an isotope with a half-life of 710
million years in just 24 days think
about it that's not even long enough to
adequately clean your apartment after
you rent it out on air B&B how is there
Jesus inside my piano
what monster would do this this isn't an
accident
it must be why they wanted a piano but
but but one of trumps other complaints
is that some parts of this deal expire
in 10 or 15 years and as he sees it that
leads to an obvious problem the bigger
problem is that they can keep the terms
and still get the bomb by simply running
out the clock again that is simply not
true they can't keep the terms and get
the bomb the terms expressly forbid them
from doing that what Iran could do in
theory is wait for parts of the deal to
expire in 10 years then it could ramp up
its nuclear program
getting it closer to a bomb but here's
the thing if the deal blows up Iran
could start doing that right now in zero
years and zero is less than 10 trust us
we ran the numbers on this ourselves I
spent a week at kangra speaking with the
location chair of mathematics Michael
Cates and and I feel virtually certain
zero is less than 10 also you should
know before the deal Iran had enough
enriched uranium to eventually create
eight to ten bombs which remember they
gave up meaning they currently have
enough for zero bombs which again is
less than ten I cannot stress enough the
extent to which 0 is less than 10 it
just is we have to agree on that or
we're all and look it is
important to remember this deal isn't
just between the u.s. and Iran there are
multiple countries involved none of whom
are anxious to change its terms even
Britain's Boris Johnson a man who looks
like what would happen if Draco Malfoy
got an MBA and developed a drinking
problem even he thinks a renegotiation
is a non-starter I don't think anybody
has come up with a better idea near
think it's on incumbent on those who
will pose the jcpoa really too to come
up with that better solution exactly you
can't just be against something without
having any plan for what comes next
Trump is like a cat on an airplane
trying to escape from its carrier okay
but if you get out then what do you have
a cat sized parachute in there with you
what's your plan here
obviously I'm not gonna say capsized
parachute without showing you a cat in a
parachute that is just a given I
wouldn't do that to you
and look what Wall Trump has articulated
broadly what he wants some of his
demands are complete non starters he
wants a ban on ballistic missile testing
unconstrained access to any military
sites and no expiration of any clause in
the agreement ever and if those are
deal-breakers for him this deal is
broken and what you would hope that
someone would talk him round Trump has
surrounded himself with Iran Hawks his
nominee for Secretary of State is Mike
Pompeo who's reportedly said of Iran we
know they're cheating we're just not
seeing it which is a hell of a statement
from a guy who gives rim jobs to
guerillas and short-short sure no one
has ever seen Mike Pompeo giving a real
job to a gorilla but that's how we know
he does it think about it and even more
worrisome is john bolton his new
national security adviser bolton is a
far-right conservative who Donald Trump
had originally considered for the job in
2016 but reportedly hesitated because of
his walrus style mustache and I've got
to say I agree with Trump on that one
that moustache is a huge problem he
looks like he's possessed by the ghost
of Borat the point is the point here is
Bolton has long been a critic of the
Iran deal I think the deal is inherently
flawed I think it's a strategic debacle
for the United States
you can always tinker around the edges
and the question is whether putting
lipstick on a pig is really going to
make a difference here come on
this deal is preventing Iran from
getting nuclear weapons it's not a pig
with lipstick besides pigs don't need
lipstick to look beautiful you
superficial these are beautiful
just the way they are I think you need
to conform your completely unrealistic
standards of farm animal beauty hashtag
22nd
both of us gone much further than that
remember that ad with the exploding
family his group made that ad and if
you're wondering well what's his
alternative to an Iran deal it can't be
war with Iran can it well just watch
this speech that he gave to a group of
Iranian dissidents in Paris last year
the declared policy of the United States
of America should be the overthrow of
the mullahs regime in Tehran
[Music]
[Applause]
the behavior and the objectives of the
regime are not going to change and
therefore the only solution is to change
the regime itself and that's and that's
why before 2019 we here will celebrate
in Tehran thank you very much
holy to my ears that is the
National Security Advisor calling for
the invasion of Iran before the end of
the year which is so flagrantly horrific
your brain can barely absorb it it's
like the Barefoot Contessa announcing
that she's going to murder and cook her
husband Jeffrey before 2019 at that
point she's been so obvious if no one
actively stops her it's partly on us so
look unless Congress or our European
allies figure out something they can
sell to trump as a fix
it seems that Trump is going to reimpose
sanctions on May 12th and if he does
that this deal could collapse and the
damage of that would be long-term and
potentially irreversible just set aside
the fact that you would alienate a whole
generation of younger Iranians who
support this deal just think about what
this would do to America's credibility
why would North Korea consider signing a
nuclear agreement with us if we just
broke the agreement we signed only three
years ago with Iran and if this deal
dies and Iran receives its nuclear
weapons program it could then start a
nuclear arms race in the Middle East and
the problem here is I can't offer you
much hope there is not really a write
your Congressman solution to this we
could be in serious trouble
because two of trumps top advisors are
like him dead set against this deal and
they're getting backup from Sean Hannity
who showed the president watches so much
advisors refer to him as the shadow
chief of staff Hannity hates this deal
too so there is not really a way for us
taxes essentially the government's
GoFundMe page now
today is April 15th which means you have
just 45 minutes to file your taxes
except relax don't panic because thanks
to the weekend and a holiday the
deadline is actually April 17th
this year except don't relax do panic
that's still not enough time to do it
right you're you're absolutely
 and you're going to jail Anthony
many people are perplexed and mystified
by our tax system perhaps best
exemplified by this Instagram video from
cardi B you know that government is
taking 40 percent of my taxes and Uncle
Sam I want to know what you're doing
with my tax money but why does
y'all doing with my money
what is your with my money I
want to know I want receipts I wants
everything I wanna go to my cousin
weenie
[Applause]
whoa whoa cardi if you really want to
know where your money's going may I
present to you the recently passed
omnibus spending package
[Applause]
because it turns out cardi your
money goes to your military your
 health care and your
Social Security and veteran and
unemployment benefits everything else is
just on discretionary and
of course interest now as you may recall
late last year Republicans passed and
Donald Trump signed a tax reform bill
and in selling it Trump made some clear
promises about who stood to benefit our
focus is on helping the folks who work
in the mail rooms and the machine shops
of America the plumbers the carpenters
the cops the teachers the truck drivers
the pipe fitters the people that like me
best well that that is clearly nonsense
because if this bill were really helping
the people that like Donald Trump best
it would exclusively benefit
Eric Trump Roseanne Barr and anyone
who's ever looked both ways before
whispering it was the choose and the
truth is for all chumps talk of pipe
fitters the biggest tax rate cuts by far
actually goes to businesses with the top
federal corporate tax rate the tax on a
company's profits going from thirty five
percent to just twenty one percent and
to be fair many policymakers on both
sides had argued at the 35 percent
federal rate among the highest in the
world
should actually come down but to be even
fairer most companies didn't pay thirty
five percent in fact before the bill was
signed to the effective rate the amount
companies actually paid was closer to
twenty four percent and some large
companies have historically paid far
less than that
you may remember a few years ago people
were furious about this ge had profits
of fourteen point two billion dollars in
2010 five billion dollars of that made
in the United States but the company's
expected US tax bill a grand total of
zero dollars okay so when the total is
zero you can't call it a grand total
there is literally no total less grand
except maybe total cereal and that's
just because it tastes like your spoon
somehow missed the cereal and now you're
just eating the box that it came in
and GE may well say we'll hold on that's
just one year but a recent study found
that between 2008 and 2015 18 large
profitable companies including General
Electric paid no federal income tax at
all over the entire period not at all
and that is a staggering total which is
incidentally what they used to call
total with raisins until they got more
honest who changed it to total with
raises but who gives a
so tonight in honor of upcoming tax day
we thought we'd give you just a glimpse
of the lengths that companies will go to
to legally avoid taxes both here and
abroad
now corporate tax avoidance has a long
and infuriatingly proud history in the
1980s for instance a lawyer named John
Carroll jr. came up with a tactic to
move US companies offshore to avoid
taxes and his firm celebrated him with
and this is true a 13-minute operator
staged in his New York apartment and
I'll give you just a very small taste
[Music]
Wow
we may have just found the only musical
resistant to race blind casting you
can't go Hamilton on this one because
those people really have to be white now
now that the tax dodge being celebrated
they're involved taking an American
company and headquarter in it in Panama
where taxes were lower something its
creator called the Panama scoot which
sounds like the name of a tiny elf in a
cowboy hat
my name's Panama scoot and I sleep in
your boots and offshore scooting is
actually something of a common theme in
corporate tax avoidance for decades
companies have hunted for ways to get
their money to friendlier tax havens
like the Cayman Islands you may remember
that during the 2012 election it emerged
that Mitt Romney had money in the in
companies in the Caymans which led to
this magnificent clip of John Stossel
saying the one thing he probably
shouldn't be saying to the person he's
speaking to but Romney pays taxes and
all the money earned from the cayman
entities i would think it would be like
pirate heaven some pirates can't say the
word pirates
to a guy with an eyepatch it can't it's
not fair
it's like me sitting down across from
you and calling you bootleg Geraldo yes
yes it's obvious but it's also lazy and
hurtful that's an indoor thought and tax
havens have become magnets to
corporations who try and shift as much
of their profits there as possible it's
a major reason why in 2016
nearly two-thirds of the profits made by
American multinationals outside the US
were booked in just six low or zero tax
countries and it's a lot easier to move
profits offshore than you might think an
increasingly popular way particularly
pharmaceutical and high-tech companies
like Google avoid paying the 35% is to
shift their patents computer code pill
formulas even logos from their US bases
to their outposts in low tax countries
today
a company can move automatically all of
its assets just on paper you can push a
button and move your algorithms you know
could take the recipe out of the vault
yeah put it in a Swiss Fault and then
and then it's Swiss yep coke could put
that recipe in a Swiss vault and their
profits would move offshore that is very
roughly how it works although for the
record just being in a Swiss vault
doesn't automatically make something
Swiss that's why we don't call this
Swiss gold we call it Nazi gold
those are Hitler bucks your Swiss
and this this happens all the time
and the best innovators in weasely
accounting have arguably been tech
companies look at Apple for years
they've been deferring paying US taxes
on foreign profits by stashing the money
overseas and not bringing it back so
much so that at the end of last year
they had 269 billion dollars parked
overseas and when their CEO Tim Cook
appeared in front of Congress a few
years back he was very defensive about
that
we pay all the taxes we owe every single
dollar we don't move intellectual
property offshore and use it to sell our
products back to the United States to
avoid taxes we don't stash money on some
Caribbean island now he was technically
correct there because Apple didn't stash
their money on a Caribbean island they
did however have it stashed on this
island Ireland which is it is true not
in the Caribbean so one word made a lot
of difference there it's like if
somebody said the one thing I can
promise you is that this refrigerator is
absolutely not
full of severed Caribbean heads maybe
that is technically true but I'm still
going to pass on a sparkling water and
when Ireland indicated that it planned
to change its tax laws Apple found a new
shelter for profits on this island the
Isle of Jersey a tax haven in the
English Channel which is again not
technically in the Caribbean although
when you really look at it you could
almost mistake it for the Caribbean if
you squint a little drink 9 points of
beer and hold a picture of the Caribbean
in front of us
meanwhile Google used a slightly
different tax workaround sending its
money on something of a world tour
Google license some of the intellectual
property it created here in the US to a
subsidiary in Ireland but it turns out
Google's overseas profits don't even get
taxed there because Google then
reportedly funnels those profits through
the Netherlands and then to of all
places Bermuda where the corporate tax
rate is zero now that tax trick actually
has a name it's called the double Irish
with a dutch sandwich it sounds like a
disgusting sex act or an even more
disgusting Waffle House menu item it's
it's when someone opens up a baked
potato farce in it and closes it again
really quick that's one of it that
that's that is exactly what it is and
when Google CFO was asked about their
tax policies at a conference his answer
nearly got him laughed off the stage we
pay our taxes in every jurisdiction to
the full extent that the law allows us
and that's what we do we pay every penny
of tax we owe to everybody everywhere ok
the reaction to the sentence I pay all
my taxes should never be incredulous
laughter unless you are a very wealthy
dog who's just spoken for the first time
and here is where I have some good news
and some bad news the good news is that
Trump's tax bill actually forces
companies to pay taxes on all the money
they've stashed overseas the hope is
that they'll then bring it home in
something called repatriation the bad
news is the tax they're being forced to
pay which may have once been 35%
remember has been slashed to as little
as eight to 15% which seems less like a
punishment and a lot more like actively
rewarding companies for tax avoidance
but Steve minuchin
Treasury secretary an objectively
good-looking man argues that this would
be a huge benefit to America's workers
we will have a one-time tax on overseas
profits which will bring back trillions
of dollars that are offshore to be
invested here in the United States to
purchase capital and to create jobs now
I know it was hard to pay attention to
what he was saying because you were just
automatically undressing
to go with your eyes and you do it
whenever he opens his mouth I'm all
right I'm definitely right the guy's a
California ten
he's a smoke show but but what he's
saying there is giving these companies a
break on the taxes they owe is worth it
because it will lead to job creation and
that is hard to completely disprove
because anything theoretically could
lead to jobs you can say I'm dipping
this badger in fudge to create jobs and
I can't prove that you won't create any
jobs by doing that but I would argue
that if creating jobs is your main goal
there are probably better ways to do it
now luckily we actually have the benefit
of a test case here because in 2004 we
basically did the exact same thing under
the American Jobs Creation Act it
offered a one-year tax holiday where
companies could bring back overseas
profits and just a five percent tax
rates the idea was that they would then
create jobs but when the Senate looked
at the employment numbers of the 15
companies that brought back the most
money this is what they found
these are the average numbers of US jobs
at those companies over a five year span
here is where the big supposedly
job-creating tax holiday kicked in and
that is pretty underwhelming I
would argue that's the most useless
ineffective holiday since Arbor Day and
I'm sorry Arbor Day but your secretaries
day for trees and we all need to accept
that in fact instead of hiring workers
across the board companies mostly
rewarded their shareholders using 94
cents out of every dollar they brought
home on stock buybacks and dividends
something you can read about in the
best-selling book yeah no
they did that by acclaimed author
everyone who knows anything about
corporations and look for many of those
companies that may have been the best
use of their money there is no point in
hiring people that you don't need
but the Trump administration is fiercely
insisting that this time their tax
holiday is already creating jobs and
some companies have seemed happy to pay
along play-along Apple put out a press
release not long after the tax bill was
signed titled Apple accelerates US
investment and job creation bragging
they were about to create over 20,000
new jobs and Trump was quick to take
credit President Trump tweeting in
response quote I promised that my
policies would allow companies like
Apple to bring mass
of amounts of money back to the United
States great to see Apple follow through
as a result of tax cuts all caps okay
first that is a solid read from Jake
Tapper there in fact I think all anchors
should be forced to shout whenever Trump
uses all caps in tweets I'll show you
this morning the president announced
that he was quote heading to see the
border wall prototypes in California or
today today the president wished all
Americans are happy Easter but but for
all the Trump's excitement those 20,000
Apple jobs were probably going to happen
anyway given that the hole was entirely
consistent with what Apple was doing in
the United States before the tax cut
bill passed and Tim Cook knows this this
is how he responded when asked just how
much of his hiring spree was down to
Trump's new tax plan there are large
parts of this that a result of the tax
reform and there's large parts of this
that we would have done in in any
situation and so I haven't spent a lot
of time in categorizing those two
because to me this is about America it's
not about which bucket you put things in
yeah but actually it does matter which
bucket you put things in because I would
rather put things in a bucket labeled
smart economic policy than one labeled
put money in here I like money thanks
dummies Tim Cook and look look there are
legitimate debates over how and how much
we should tax corporate profits but we
just had a huge chance to reform our tax
code and we absolutely blew it because
effective tax reform is not just about
lowering rates
it's about closing loopholes for
instance one reasonable idea raised last
year was forcing companies to pay a
minimum tax in every single country they
operate in it's a bit complicated but
that may well have reduced their abuse
of tax havens but that proposal never
even got out of committee so the result
here is that our tax code is still full
of loopholes and however much Trump
talked about how tax reform would
benefit cops and pipefitters
it's worth knowing that once he got
behind closed doors his message seemed
to change
we're told the president is still
celebrating passage of the Republican
tax cut bill sources with firsthand
which tells CBS News that he told a
group of wealthy people at his exclusive
mar-a-lago estate quote you all just got
a lot richer that's right so on Tuesday
as you scrape together your taxes and
like cardi B wonder what Uncle Sam is
doing with your money rest
assured that Donald Trump's tax reform
continues to let companies engage in
sophisticated tax avoidance schemes and
to those companies I say this on behalf
of America please enjoy this double
Irish with a Dutch sandwich I made it bu
myself eat it while it's hot
[Applause]
you
pornography some people believe it
should be available and accessible
without stigma others think well it's
not for me but it's fine for other
people in certain situations and a few
people think it should be banned
completely oh did I say pornography
sorry I meant abortion our main story
tonight is abortion and yes yes we have
talked about it before last time we
looked at the way abortion laws in
America have in many places made access
to abortion difficult as clinics all
over the country have shut down but
tonight we're going to focus on the
exact opposite of an abortion clinic
something called a crisis pregnancy
center facilities whose primary purpose
is to talk women out of terminating a
pregnancy something they don't often
make that clear instead running
friendly-looking ads like this before
you make the decision about a pregnancy
that comes at a less-than-perfect time
get jelly on the belly come to sunrise
woman's clinic a clinic where nurses
specialize in early pregnancy options
okay jelly on the belly is a pretty
childish way to describe an important
medical procedure I'm not sure that I
would trust a doctor that referred to
colonoscopies as looking for cooties in
the bootys second one of the early
pregnancy options that you won't get at
sunrise woman's clinic is an abortion
but that can be hard to tell from their
vague name and marketing and that
actually happens a lot with cpc's take
the center for pregnancy choices in
Mississippi it sounds like a welcoming
place the website even has links labeled
thinking abortion and thinking parenting
and it was founded by a woman named
Barbara Bevers whose very name sounds
like that of a sassy mother in a TV show
about a family of beavers it would be
called hot damn and it would be
absolutely delightful but once you're
inside her CPC you will find that it is
vehemently against any choice that is
not carrying a pregnancy to term in fact
just listen to Barbara explain where she
stands on abortion you're deceiving
yourself if you say you can kill your
baby and it'd be good for you that's
just deception that's not true
it doesn't it doesn't register with
reality
mamas women are not made that way women
are made to protect in a garden to to
die for their babies not their babies to
die for them holy
let me be perfectly clear here Barbara
the only females made to die for their
babies are Pacific salmon they lay
thousands of eggs and then die after
spawning you're welcome tune in next
week for more of Johnny O's fish facts
wildlife wonders and abortion and
centers like that one are proliferating
there are now 2,700 pregnancy centers in
America compared to less than 1,700
abortion providers and the discrepancy
is even worse in certain states
Mississippi for example has one abortion
clinic and 38 crisis pregnancy centers
so if they are that prevalent people
should absolutely know what they are and
look if you believe abortion is immoral
you are of course allowed to set up a
center dedicated to convincing women of
that but what is happening with cpc's is
that way too often women with unplanned
pregnancies are being actively misled
while trying to access healthcare and
cpc's seem happy to have women confuse
them for abortion clinics just listen to
Abby Johnson an anti-abortion activist
addressing a conference for one of the
largest CPC organizations we want to
appear neutral on the outside the best
call the best client you ever get is one
that thinks they're walking into an
abortion clinic okay those are the best
clients that could ever walk in your
door or call your Center the ones that
think you provide abortions Wow
normally the strategy pretend you're an
abortion clinic is not actually a great
marketing stunt although I am pretty
sure that RadioShack would have tried
that if they thought of it sorry we
don't actually perform abortions here
but what I've got you it can I interest
you in a gently used USB cord or a
Microsoft Zune they come in brown and
the efforts to conceal their true intent
takes many forms starting with the name
many cpc's have the word choice in their
names like choices women's center
informed choices medical clinic and all
these other
CBC's all of which feature the words
choice in their name and I know that
almost every product does a bit of
misleading advertising no one would buy
Pepsi if they were honest and called it
sad coke or you wouldn't buy a
mini-cooper if they admit it they were
just clown cars for regular people and
while it should be easy to clarify any
misconceptions with a simple phone call
that can be difficult just listen to
what happens when one woman called a CPC
for information and keep in mind when
you listen that the center absolutely
under no circumstances ever provides
abortions so cpc's can lure women to
meet with them on false pretenses
basically they are catfishing them a
term that was coined because of course
catfish are constantly trying to trick
women who are out of their league into
 them that's right that's right
you thought we were out of fish facts
you were wrong we have millions because
we're talking about abortion and cpc's
can even intercept people's internet
searches and routinely
buy Google Keyword ads for phrases like
abortion and abortion clinic and
frequently they'll go even further and
try and physically intercept people
because they often locate themselves as
close as possible to abortion clinics
for instance one abortion provider in
Hartford ran into some real problems
with a similarly named CPC when they
deliberately located just 20 feet from
them this woman who we aren't
identifying speaks candidly about the
difficult decision she had to make after
becoming pregnant after a rape I didn't
want the baby it was a lot on my soul
eventually she decided to seek the
services of the Hartford GYN she
initially went for counseling and she
can remember how the clinic's neighbor
Hartford Women's Health tried to offer
unsolicited counsel as well they was
trying to tuck me over the end and I was
like you know
you making me feel bad now clearly
that's absolutely horrible and incidents
like that was so routine that the
abortion clinic in question in an
attempt to keep its clients from going
to the wrong place
painted the ramp outside their door
bright yellow like The Wizard of Oz
which is actually a properly because
that movie too involves a young woman
getting stalked several times by idiots
bothering her with their own
issues and she just tries to get what
she needs to go and if cpc's
can't get a physical location right next
to an abortion clinic they have another
trick up their sleeve and that is busses
that can literally park outside and try
and tempt women in many cpc's operate
mobile clinics with the help of
organizations like save the stalks a
name which really should immediately set
off red flags oh let me go into this pan
and talk to someone who thinks babies
are brought by a deformed pigeon on
stilts and to listen to them tell it
their vans are an absolute joy to be
inside these vehicles fit in one parking
spot it'll go right at the door of an
abortion clinic every store bus is a
bathroom on it to be able to do a
pregnancy test built-in refrigerator the
seats are all leather this massage chair
this thing is really good for the back
we've had a lot of good reviews from the
pregnant women on the massage chair
look if someone wanted to spend their
time in the back of a plush van and then
be told not to have an abortion
they just the lead singer of creed
and once once cpc's have women inside
their building or van they can employ
every tactic in the book to try and get
them to change their mind literally
every tactic in the book because
heartbeat international which has 1,400
affiliates in the US has this handbook
with suggested scripts featuring some
nonsense information it suggests telling
pregnant women that 35% of suicidal
behaviors among women may be
attributable to abortion which is
 it also says that abortion
almost doubles the risk of breast cancer
which is also and while in
reality abortion is far less medically
dangerous than carrying a child to term
that hasn't stopped some CPC employees
from saying things like this if people
die due to an abortion later on a lot of
times they're finding parts of the fetus
in like the lungs or the heart oh yeah
yeah that that happens a lot of times
doesn't it which is why you're so often
reading the obituaries and see Sarah
Mitchell passed away last week at the
age of 34 after she got baby dicks right
in the heart it happens all the time
we're tired of reading it and the thing
is that medical advice can actually look
pretty legitimate because cpc's often
have the trappings of a health care
facility increasingly they offer free
ultrasounds which can sound appealing
it's free but often they're not
performing them so much for medical
reasons as for emotional manipulation
just watch this Christian Broadcasting
Network profile of women who give free
ultrasounds in this bus that parks
outside abortion clinics just watch as
they describe their technique they
usually start crying as we begin and
cover their eyes and as we're continuing
the ultrasound they start peeking out
between their fingers and we called it a
baby and we call them mom and look your
baby's sucking his thumb oh he has the
hiccups she and all who operate the
ultrasound machine will spend as much
time as needed with the new moms she
stays on that table until where until
she she decides she
baby if that isn't coercive enough which
it comfortably is technicians at other
clinics have written messages uninvited
on the ultrasound like hi mommy and
daddy and if you were gonna write an
unrequested ultrasound message at least
be creative about it right on totally
pooping in here or I ate my twin or
please don't put this on Facebook
everyone hates that finally see pcs can
and have misled women about how pregnant
they are or have delayed their decision
to have an abortion past the point where
it's possible watch as one doctor
describes a case of a woman who came to
her in her third trimester having been
under the care of a CPC that gave her
terrible advice I told her that she
didn't have to worry she didn't have to
rush there was no time issue because
they do abortion in New York City up
until term which is patently ridiculous
so when she came to me she was too
pregnant she had her partner had
abandoned her she had no money she had
three other children she had no
intention of being pregnant and when she
became pregnant during the time of her
pregnancy she'd been using drugs and
alcohol she very responsibly went to end
the pregnancy and now I had to tell her
you're gonna have a baby
no that is obviously heartbreaking and
here's the thing for all the lengths
that cpc's will go to to prevent
abortions many of them don't do a key
thing that would really help that and
that's give women access to birth
control in fact that script from before
instructs cpc's
to tell people condoms are ineffective
in preventing pregnancy and some
operators like Barbara beavers are hard
skeptics condoms don't they don't
prevent even used correctly there's like
a 20 percent failure rate even used
correctly there's a relatively high
failure rate of condoms I thought oh I
don't think that's good I don't think
that's correct I would question it so
I'll find some of our data what what are
you laughing
Barbara is it because deep down even you
Barbara beavers know that your data is
complete horseshit because the fact is
if you want fewer abortions you should
love birth control you should be filling
Pez dispensers with birth control pills
you should be giving condoms out to
trick-or-treaters and our UD earrings
out as hostess gifts birth control
should be your favorite thing in the
whole world but of course many of these
cpc's are about much more than just
abortion they're about controlling
women's sexual behavior
many are church-affiliated like the
Pregnancy Care Center in Fort Pierce
Florida which was started by a Catholic
priest he's called father Thomas ight
now now I don't want to say that he had
a condescending view of women but watch
him describe the links that he would go
to to lure them away from entering an
abortion clinic I remember the time when
they had the fence up in front of the
place they put the fence up I decided
that I would talk to him and over the
fence by bringing a ladder and getting
on top of the ladder and talking to and
so of course that generated a 911
because I was now talking down
[Laughter]
literally and figuratively talking down
to them I made it clear there are many
vessels for the purpose of giving birth
and nothing else I don't actually even
see them as for humans that's why what I
do is funny I break myself up I'm not
I'm a chuckle monster that's priceless
now quick sidenote about that particular
priest not long after that was filmed he
admitted to violating the boundaries of
chastity with the woman who accused him
of molesting her for two years during
what was supposed to be an exorcism and
some of the details in her allegations
are insane he kissed the corners of her
mouth stroked her legs breasts and
thighs breasts her face laid his body on
top of hers and frequently explained
full passionate kisses as blowing the
Holy Spirit into her let us be clear if
you are doing anything that can be
described as blowing the Holy Spirit
into someone you are very much doing
kissing wrong and unless your idea of an
exorcism is making the woman burp a lot
you're also doing exorcisms wrong as
well which could be why it took you two
years at this point at this point you
might be wondering how you can give
women ultrasounds and inaccurate medical
information and not break the law well
cpc's are very careful to stop just
short of the line where they will be
regulated as health care providers and
this offers them numerous advantages for
example they're generally not subject to
HIPAA a federal law requiring that
patients information be kept private
which is frankly not ideal in a setting
where such sensitive information is
being shared and if you are not already
angry enough at this point the
government actually funds cpc's you are
paying for them they they can get
federal funding and sixteen states use
taxpayer money to fund them directly and
they will say they will say that they're
fervently held beliefs can justify some
of the methods that you've seen tonight
and they might point to the assistance
that some centers provide to young
mothers like parenting classes and free
diapers which is great if those women
want
be mothers although as Abby Johnson
advised CPC operators in that conference
he saw earlier that that help can be
surprisingly limited if I want to open a
Pregnancy Center I would not have
pregnancy items past six months
are we running a charity are we running
a place where we want women to become
self-sufficient self-sufficient right
have maternity clothes have those things
available for the women while they're
pregnant but cut them off Wow
so the basic argument there is we're
just not in a position where we can take
care of a baby forever we don't have the
time or the resources so we're choosing
not to make that commitment right now so
which I would say the tactics that cpc's
often use are disingenuous and predatory
and it's absolutely critical that people
understand that but they really don't
watch how one local news outlet covered
the opening of a CPC in the gigantic
care net Network Schuylkill County is
one of the only counties in our area
that does not have a Planned Parenthood
but that doesn't mean teens don't have a
place to go for help Karen out of
Schuylkill County recently expanded to
two facilities
one for parents and one for expecting
mothers under the age of 21 no don't say
that because if you want all the options
available to you those two are not
remotely the same that's like saying hey
our town doesn't have a youth sports
league but we do have a large scary man
in sweatpants who will chase your kids
around
ptoo operates out of a van and and
people need to understand this because
right now it is way too easy for a
religious organization to disguise its
true nature establish a CPC and provide
women with dangerously poor information
about one of their most important health
choices and I can prove to you how easy
it is you may remember back in season
two I established the Church of Our Lady
of Perpetual exemption with my lovely
wife Wanda Jo Oliver
well last week we filed paperwork in New
York to create a new nonprofit Our Lady
of choosing choice to set up our own
crisis pregnancy center so where will
our clinic be that depends where are you
right now because our clinic has wheels
and we will travel behold behold our new
[Music]
[Applause]
look
you know that there is absolutely no way
that I would open this alone right
[Applause]
how do you wonder Joe how'd you get to
you oh thank you so much now now in this
band we are allowed to tell women
whatever dubious information comes into
our heads isn't that right my wonder
that's right my John tell women if they
get an abortion it'll make a ghost baby
that'll hug your hoo-ha forever
that is spooky ER but what else do you
say wonder getting an abortion turns
your breast milk into kombucha that's
weird
it is weird one more facts for the
people at home one gasps you're an
abortion your vagina feels sharp like an
Egyptian - wow that's a striking image
these are all things that we can say
legally required in New York chef Amy
training and all to use this ultrasound
machine wow that's absolutely terrifying
well in that case let's get some jelly
on some bellies I got great I got red
berry I'm gonna really just gummy bears
[Laughter]
we're told that what the joke I've got
to ask you something it's a tricky
question how do you feel about birth
control
I'm glad you asked you know I do give
out condoms but I tell people there's
zero percent effective you too
how's that possibly cut the tips off
these suckers well lets you blow the
holy spirit right on through Wow Wow
look the best part is just like our
church we are tax exempt and we could be
eligible for government funding praise
discretionary budgets what don't cry
don't cry the point is this is all
perfectly legal and there is absolutely
nothing stopping us from parking outside
an abortion clinic tonight and
haranguing people first thing in the
morning and frankly they're really
[Music]
course you know the place where millions
of Americans end up every year after
making a large squirrel talk to CEO
of a coal company just center about
judicial system they are the backbone of
daytime TV the college student to bring
system mommy Judy don't get me preaching
up in here today you're watching the
verdict with judge Hatchett a show
that's making a difference you need to
be sober seven days a week for turn any
court I know cuz I'm not stupid
that you're a liar then and you're a
liar now the People's Court pack of dogs
draw blood this is a confession this is
a no dog I've had all my shots hot
now I know that looks like a fun episode
of hot bench but but you should know
that cute dog actually confessed to
murdering 14 people in the Pacific
Northwest so it's not quite as fun as
they just made it look but tonight we're
gonna focus on a type of justice then
you don't get to watch on TV and it
concerns immigration courts they're one
of those things you may not know much
about but are actually hugely important
to a significant number of people like
gefilte fish or the Insane Clown Posse
now in recent months you may have seen
multiple stories of ice agents raiding
workplaces and hauling people away and
while those stories are horrifying and
grab all the attention the place many of
those people end up immigration courts
are no less troubling there are around
sixty of them all over the country and
hundreds of thousands of people go
through them every year
pleading their case against deportation
so they are hugely consequential and the
stakes in these cases can be incredibly
high as one girl awaiting a hearing can
attest what'd happen if we sent you home
they're gonna kill me they're gonna
they're gonna kill me and they're gonna
kill my family that's horrible because
no child should have to worry about
whether they're going to be murdered the
biggest thing they should be worrying
about Oh are whether they can sit with
the cool kids while they eat their Tide
Pods and how they can please Slenderman
and that last one is obviously
ridiculous because remember kids
Slenderman already loves you just the
way you are
so this is a critical potentially
life-and-death process sadly the system
is a complete mess and don't take that
from me take that from multiple current
and former immigration court judges I
think most people would be incredulous
at what really happens in immigration
court and which sometimes passes for due
process our courts today are
dysfunctional in essence we're doing
death penalty cases in a traffic court
setting death penalty cases in traffic
court that is something we probably
shouldn't be doing in a place that we
definitely shouldn't be doing it like
having a cockfight in an emergency room
or doing coke in a build-a-bear workshop
it's a crazy idea it gets stuck in the
Bears hair it's completely inefficient
so so how did this system get so broken
well let's start with the fact that a
surgeon immigration from Central America
wrapped up immigration enforcement and a
glacial rate of hiring judges have
combined to create a truly massive
backlog of cases more than six hundred
and seventeen thousand immigration cases
are now backlogged that number has more
than doubled since 2009 the Mayo
Silverado it's as if they have forgotten
us is under this one of the watermelon
immigrants waiting for his hearing in
San Francisco where the average wait
time is three years in Miami the wait is
about a year and a half and it's much
worse in cities like San Antonio Atlanta
and Chicago that's true the estimated
wait time in Chicago is five years and
if you are stuck in that line that's not
good for your case because evidence for
your plane can become stale and
witnesses who could help you can
disappear or die and yet over 600,000
cases have piled up endlessly like Bed
Bath and Beyond coupons New Yorker
magazines and DVR'd episodes of Ken
Burns's Vietnam documentary yeah I know
it's good but I'm just never in the mood
and I never ever will be ever ever ever
ever but
issues the issues go much deeper than
just long wait times because while
immigration courts have the trappings of
a criminal court you can wind up there
from an arrest you can be detained
awaiting your hearing and you're arguing
against the government there are
actually civil courts because this is
not a criminal trial their only task is
deciding whether or not you can stay in
the country that's it so a lot of things
that you might assume someone in these
courts would have access to they don't
and the first big one is this
unlike Criminal Court in immigration
court the federal government is not
required to provide lawyers to
defendants who cannot afford them
exactly if you can't afford a lawyer you
have to defend yourself which is clearly
a terrible idea
think of an immigration hearing like
surgery you can try and do it yourself
but if you ever want to see your
family again maybe try and get a
professional to help you and troublingly
only 37 percent of immigrants in these
courts have counsel meaning the majority
of them are appearing in front of the
judge without a lawyer and some in
particular really need one many of the
undocumented children that walk into the
immigration court house don't have an
attorney and must represent themselves
there's children from two years old to
17 years old who are appearing by
themselves who are sitting there without
a clue about what's happening that's
just clearly ridiculous because you
cannot let a two-year-old to be
unsupervised in court you can't even let
her two-year-old be unsupervised in a
bouncy castle they're gonna come out
covered in glitter holding a broken beer
bottle and a dead bird how did they get
them in there who knows the point is
they can't be left alone for a second
and that bird has already been in their
mouth it just has you have to deal with
that reality and while sending kids into
court without representation might seem
crazy to you amazingly some judges are
apparently fine with it
because when a lawsuit was filed arguing
all kids need lawyers jack while an
assistant chief immigration judge
suggested that's not necessarily the
case I've taught immigration law just
literally two three-year-olds and
four-year-olds
takes a lot of time it takes a lot of
patience they get it it's not the most
efficient but but it can be done no it
can't
you can't teach immigration law to a
three-year-old you can't even explain to
a child that age the ELMO isn't his best
friend Elmo's not only a puppet he's a
celebrity he's never even heard of you
your relationship is completely
asymmetrical one immigration lawyer
actually put judge wilds whole three
year-olds theory to the test in what is
perhaps the single greatest mock trial
ever recorded and do you speak English
as your native language
[Music]
I like your balloon - what is your best
language where were you born
I read mommy in suits so do you feel
like you can go ahead and represent
yourself in immigration court to
determine your nationality uh-huh all
right are you excited to do it yeah of
course she's excited she knows all the
most important legal principles if I
like my balloon you mustn't deport soon
and if I place a tie over fairies
together with the asylum that lawyer
actually did a series of videos with
kids and they are all great but my
favorite is this one if you were removed
would you like to designate a country of
removal yeah okay what country would
that be
yeah oh yeah you laugh now but it won't
be so cute when that girl is deported
back to Papa John's because it's
technically pizza and that is exactly
why these children need lawyers but the
truth is whether you have a lawyer or
not your odds of success to a
frightening degree may be dictated by
where you are in San Francisco
immigrants are deported in 36% of cases
in Charlotte the number jumps to 84% in
New York City only 24% of cases result
in deportation in Atlanta the rate is
almost 90 percent I'm look while the
merits of every case are different that
is an alarming disparity between courts
normally the only thing that should
varied that much by region is the rate
of Jeff Dunham fans per capita and
regardless of where you are in either
case that number should never be as high
as 90% and the final quirk of this
system is that immigration courts are
not nearly as independent as they should
be because while you might assume that
they be part of the judicial branch
immigration courts are actually part of
the executive branch specifically
they're run by the DOJ making them
subject to shifting political priorities
so for instance right now the boss of
all these judges is this man Jeff
Sessions the only cabinet member allowed
to fly as a lap infant on a domestic
flight and he has made it pretty clear
what his priorities are for those that
continue to seek improper and illegal
entry into this country be forewarned
this is a new era
this is the Trop era you know it's a
very specific type of person who grins
when saying the words the Trump era it's
basically people with Trump's name
people with Trump's hats and the one
person in America is still getting a
kick out of cough FA hey I don't agree
with everything the guy says but boy we
had some laughs because it's not a word
confer fades not a word that that's why
it's funny
that's odds priceless
and sessions the thing is sessions has a
weird amount of power over immigration
courts he can refer cases to himself
which basically means stepping in and
personally reviewing decisions he
actually picked up a case recently
concerning a woman deemed eligible for
asylum over a year ago based on domestic
violence that she suffered four years
under her ex-husband in El Salvador now
if he overturns that decision not only
could that woman be deported but he
could also set precedents making it
harder for other domestic violence
victims to get asylum and while sessions
isn't the exact last person I'd want to
set precedents on domestic violence
he's pretty near the bottom of that list
right before Oh Jay Simpson Johnny Depp
and mr. peanut and if you don't know
what that last one is referring to just
Google mr. peanut domestic violence
honestly I have no idea what you'll find
but give it a try we might only surprise
the point here is when you combine all
of these factors backlogged courts lack
of representation and judges without
full independence you can have cases
that don't even seem to resemble justice
for example a few months ago the New
Yorker told the story of a woman from
Honduras who asked them to identify her
as Elena ms-13 killed two or third
brothers and shot her sister she fled to
America and turned herself in to border
patrol now DHS said that she didn't
qualify for asylum because she couldn't
prove credible fear of violence back
home so so she appealed requesting a
hearing with an immigration judge and
I'm about to play that hearing for you
in its entirety seriously this is the
whole thing I have read with the asylum
officer rhoads he told the asylum
officer that some gang member became
infatuated with you wanted you to be
with him wanted you to open a bank
account so the criminal proceeds from
the gang could be placed there and you
refused yes I said no did you move to
any other city in Honduras before coming
to the United States no the government
of the United States doesn't afford you
protection
for this type of reason I affirm the
asylum officers decision that was it did
you move no okay goodbye and thanks to
that hearing elena was deported back to
Honduras where she was assaulted at
gunpoint
by the gang member she had fled because
it turned out her fear was pretty
 credible now we trimmed the
parts in that were a translator
interprets between her and the judge but
even keeping all of that in the full
hearing lasted one minute and
forty-three seconds there were only two
questions for context that hot bench
episode you saw at the start whether tog
had written a confession was 8 minutes
long and we counted 32 questions which
is absurd there should have been only
one question there how the did that
dog write this letter changed this list
and in some cases deportations do turn
out to be a death sentence take
Constantino Morales a Mexican police
officer was targeted by a drug cartel he
fled to the US and ended up in
immigration court in Nebraska he
couldn't afford an attorney so he
represented himself in court before a
judge who opts to deport eighty four
percent of the time Morales lost his
case and filmed this message after that
decision I'm being deported they are
deporting me it was four years of
fighting my request was denied but you
have to fight to the end don't be scared
no worries life goes on he was deported
back to Mexico and six months and 29
days after that decision he was killed
and that is heartbreaking
obviously so clearly this whole system
is broken so the question really is how
can it be fixed sessions has said that
he wants to hire more judges which the
system does need but he's also said that
he wants the judges to move faster and
advocated for increased scrutiny of what
he calls fake asylum claims which does
seem like the wrong approach because
immigration courts are a lot like sex
the way to improve them is rarely to say
hey let's do it a lot faster and meaner
and let's have Jeff Sessions overseeing
the whole thing
but the truth the truth here is we are
going to need big changes ideally the
biggest change would be to make the
courts fully independent from the DOJ
which is something that can't happen
overnight or under this particular
Congress probably at all
but at the very least we should
absolutely fix the stupidest problem of
all which is that nobody particularly
children should have to represent
themselves in these courts because
children do not understand the law
having them alone in a courtroom is a
terrible idea and to prove it to you I
give you the stupidest new court show
imaginable you've seen a lot of
corporate shows but you've never seen
one like this that's right in this
courtroom
everyone is three or four years old
everyone that is except that offended
what the is this a joke no this
isn't our bench and in this week's
episode this arsonist is in the hot seat
just objects object it's object not the
dot he's got the best legal advice
that's real rule can give that's the
difference between a banana of the cow I
don't know what what yeah
Todd Bench has everything a bailiff I
still not refer do you even know my name
I don't know who David Schwimmer has
David Schwimmer was not even impact our
Ridge ok the stenographers leaving now
a courtroom artist oh so there's a
sketch artist now great sure she's
terrible that's so good and of course
judge Riley how did you become a judge I
believed in myself to be a dead how long
have you been doing this
14 years you've been doing this for 14
years but you're four it's a case with
twists and turns
there was another judge what happened to
her she wet her pants and snacks so many
snacks well anyone share their snacks
with me you'll even see a lawyer turn on
his own client please just tell them
that I didn't burn down the hospital you
bring down that I did sorry you didn't
blow down to us oh and you know what I
am guilty all right there you go
I'm guilty god damn this small time back
is it stupid sure but is it any dumber
than how America's immigration courts
have run barely the judge sentenced me
to a jillion years I mean a jillion is
not even a number I mean this whole who
through that topic
you
Mike Pence vice-president the United
State and whatever the exact opposite of
a Silver Fox is I'm gonna go with action
weasel and if you're wondering why talk
about pence well with all the recent
focus on who Trump is firing in the
White House it is worth remembering the
one person that that cannot actually
happen to president Trump cannot but see
mr. pence as the indispensable man in
his inner circle he is brett by statute
the one person in the West Wing to whom
Donald Trump cannot say you're fired
that is true now while in many ways
pence is like any other Trump employee
ethically compromised creeps the
out by Jared and subjected to all sorts
of unwanted physical contact hence is
constitutionally the only official in
the White House that Trump can't fire
and that is worrisome because he is
synonymous with some extreme positions
like his opposition to abortion and gay
rights just listen to our osa who
remember had first-hand experience
working with him we would be begging for
days of Trump back if pence became
president that's all of this game he's
extreme I'm Christian I love Jesus
but he thinks Jesus tells him to say
thanks
Jesus I say that she's right Omarosa is
right there also I'm pretty sure the
original titles of the new and Old
Testaments were Jesus said this and
Jesus I say that so
so if Pence is that terrifying tonight
let's take a look at him and and if
there are any Mike Pence supporters
watching this I cannot promise that he
is going to come out of tonight's show
looking great but I can promise that I
will say something nice about him before
this piece is over you have my word on
that
so let's begin Pence's reputation is as
the old boring principal to contrast to
Donald Trump but the truth is he's been
more than willing to defend the
indefensible and while all politicians
equivocate Pence is exceptionally good
at dodging tough questions just look at
this interview from just after Trump
tweeted entirely falsely that he had won
the popular vote if you just deducted
the millions of people who voted
illegally watch how many times pence
refuses to engage in the premise of the
question that statement is false why is
it responsible to make it well I think I
think the president-elect just wants a
call to call to attention the fact that
that there has been evidence over over
many years of fraud and and and
expressing that reality the Pew Research
Center found evidence of that four years
ago as certainly certainly his right but
you know it's his right to make false
statements well it's it's his right to
express his opinion as a president-elect
to the United States I think one of the
things that's refreshing about our
president-elect and the it's one of the
reasons why I think he made such an
incredible connection with people all
across this country is because he he
tells you what's on his mind but why
make false statements well look I don't
know that that is a false statement
George and neither do you but yes you do
though because everyone knows that
statement was which is why it's
a little alarming that pence would be so
willing to defend a complete lie by
calling it refreshing because if that's
the standard you can say all sorts of
things in the names of refreshment you
could say Mike Pence spent four hundred
thousand dollars having his penis
replaced with a marshmallow peep is that
true who knows but try telling me you're
not refreshed hearing about it
but despite lies like that pence is
well-liked among evangelical voters
eight out of ten of whom voted for the
Trump pence ticket and he does have
impeccable credentials as a social
conservative pence used to have a local
radio show the Mike Pence show in the
90s where he sounded off on hot-button
issues and while current pence is
controlled and polished back then he was
surprisingly animated just listen to him
address one day's topic with some real
contempt in his voice early in the week
we talked about whether or not it was
time to rethink this whole business of
women in the military what the is
that toe he's saying women in the
military with the same perm you skeptics
as we used to describe this whole
business of dinosaurs in medical school
or chair in the starting lineup for the
Cleveland Cavaliers she's a bench player
at best you restrict her minutes we all
know that look
he wasn't just being provocative there
he means it two years later pence wrote
an editorial attacking the Disney film
Mulan for showing a woman in combat
concluding women in military bad idea
and if you're thinking well well come on
he grew up in the 1950s it's just a
generational thing no he didn't he's 58
years old Pence is three months younger
than flavor flake who has no
excuse there
and that was just one of many ludicrous
opinions that pentas expressed over the
years he also argued for the teaching of
intelligent design in schools he
expressed they hoped to consign Roe
versus Wade to the ash heap of history
and as governor of Indiana responded to
an HIV outbreak among drug users by
dragging his feet on allowing needle
exchange programs during which time he
said he was going to go home and pray on
it which and I realize this isn't
necessarily the most relevant criticism
here but can't you do that from the
office but perhaps the issue Pence is
most associated with is his hostility to
LGBT rights and it is not just me saying
that his boss seems to think so too
The New Yorker setting a campaign
staffer reports that behind closed doors
Trump had a habit of mocking Vice
President Mike Pence's religiosity when
the conversation turned to gay rights
Trump motion towards pence and joked
don't ask that guy you want to hang them
all look look Trump is clearly joking
about that but it is also the kind of
punch line that only works if we all
know the premise behind it to be true
like jokes about terrible airline food
or bad breakups or how people from
Toronto a terrified of hard boiled eggs
their jokes based on universal knowledge
we all agree on and the truth is pence
is not and has never been a friend of
the gay community over the years he
sport anti-discrimination laws that
would have protected them
he's also opposed allowing gays to serve
in the military openly or otherwise with
his campaigns website saying
homosexuality is incompatible with
military service and he wants defended
the sanctity of marriage in another
surprisingly passionate speech marriage
was ordained by God instituted in the
law is the glue of the American family
and the safest harbor to raise children
and it must be defended against the
onslaught of the left in the Congress in
the courts and if need be in the
Constitution of the United States of
America
holy if if if I may quote one of
America's greatest philosophers when
pence made national news by signing a
controversial Religious Freedom
Restoration Act which many felt enable
businesses to discriminate on the basis
of sexuality and realloc Xander and her
wife Cynthia believe it's an invitation
to discriminate by refusing service you
know we don't know what restaurants or
what stores we can go into and you know
not be turned away and have to suffer
you know that's degrading it's
embarrassing exactly people were afraid
of being turned away from restaurants
and it is bad enough for someone to
privately dislike you for your sexuality
but it's even worse to be publicly told
that you are too gay for waffles and and
yet and yet when this possibility was
raised to pence by his arch nemesis
George Stephanopoulos he refused to even
engage in the question so yes or no if a
florist in Indiana refuses to serve a
gay couple at their wedding is that
legal now in Indiana George this is this
is where this debate has gone with with
misinformation and it's just a question
sir yes well well this there's been
shameless rhetoric about my state and
about this law and about its intention
all over the Internet do you think it
should be legal in the state of Indiana
to discriminate against gays or lesbians
George it's a yes or no question come on
Hoosiers don't believe in discrimination
that's neither the word yes
nor the word no it's the word Hoosier
which isn't an answer to any question
besides what's a good derogatory slang
term for an owl with a drinking problem
look at yourself you're Hoosier you're
gonna go fly into a tree get
your life together
 Hoosier but while Hoosiers may
not believe in discrimination Mike Pence
clearly does and yet interestingly one
specific allegation he's pushed back on
concerns whether or not he supported gay
conversion therapy a question the
frankly didn't come out of nowhere when
Mike Pence ran for Congress in Indiana
in the 1990s his campaign agenda
included this resources should be
directed toward those institutions which
provide assistance to those seeking to
change their sexual behavior according
to the vice president spokesperson mr.
pence did not and does not support gay
conversion therapy okay
well I personally find that denial
complete horseshit I will acknowledge
that the language on his website was
very carefully worded it does give him
an escape and his denial is the grossest
effort I've seen to reverse a decision
made in the early orts apart from
Russell Crowe's actual upcoming divorce
auction to settle his 2003 marriage it
is called Russell Crowe the art of
divorce it's real and it's amazing and
you can buy items such as this leather
jock strap used during the filming of
Cinderella Man will we be stupid enough
to bid on that I don't know why don't
you ask one of our five wax presidents
the point here is that's not the point
the point here is pence denies
supporting conversion therapy but that's
a little hard to take considering how
much he is praised someone closely
associated with it because one of his
mentor's is the notorious homophobe
James Dobson and if you are not familiar
with him I'll let him introduce himself
in a truly unsettling way I represent an
organization called
focus on a family which a three year old
one time called pocus and the fanny you
know that's not far off from what we're
trying to do in some ways I guess you
could say we're thrusting ourselves into
the whole of American spiritual life and
reaching around to grab the temples of
secular decadence because that's what
Focus on the Family is all about having
gay sex that's right reducing the rate
of gay sex by at least half the the
organization the Dobson founded Focus on
the Family has a history of promoting
conversion therapy for a decade if
sponsored a conference addressing
understanding and preventing
homosexuality called love one out which
could not sound any more like a
euphemism for masturbating as in all
this talk of being poked in the fanny
really makes me want to go and love one
out Dobson Dobson also wrote a book
titled marriage under fire in which he
stated Focus on the Family promotes the
truth that homosexuality is preventable
and treatable and he produced a video
series in which he elaborated on that
theme we want to talk about the
prevention and treatment of
homosexuality in boys they're more than
a thousand who are being treated at any
given time for homosexuality they don't
all change it's not easy to change I
don't want to imply that it's just a
simple thing you just decide you're not
gonna be homosexual anymore no there are
deeply rooted factors that account for
this and they are tough to whip now
obviously there is no such thing as the
homosexual agenda but if there were
whipping bad boys by the thousands
wouldn't not be on it now now Dobson
left Focus on the Family in
2010 and they have since claimed that
they have softened their message but if
you go to their website right now you
will find articles like when a loved one
says I'm gay the stages of grief and why
we support sexual orientation change
efforts not to mention the fact that
their logo still features a child who
dismembered to her parents and is
holding their severed arms aloft in some
sort of gruesome impish victory dance
and I think that's just sick so while
pants may claim that he did not and does
not support gay conversion therapy he
very much supports those who support his
because just last year as vice president
he was in Colorado saying this it is
great to be here on the 40th anniversary
of Focus on the Family allow me to
acknowledge the founder of this ministry
a man who became the author of an
enormous body of work that has inspired
millions and he's been a friend and a
mentor to me dr. James Dobson look
saying you don't support conversion
therapy and then calling Dobson your
mentor is like saying you're a staunch
vegetarian and a law abiding citizen and
by the way please meet my lifelong
friend and mentor the Hamburglar
and pence is not saying that as a city
radio host or an Indiana congressman he
say it as vice president of the United
States in which role he also presented
Dobson with an award just last June and
that is appalling and all this makes it
even more galling that at the start of
this piece I promised that I would
mention one thing that I liked about
pence and look a promise is a promise so
through gritted teeth here it is I kind
of like his rabbit I really genuinely do
and also I'm not the only one the vice
president and his wife could kiss their
audiences attention goodbye once Marlin
bundo was introduced that's right the
pen C's have a pet rabbit and his name
is Marlon Banda which again it kills me
to say this is an objectively good name
for a bunny
and Marlin boldo is a great rabbit he
has his own Instagram account here is
making an important phone call here he
is making another one this time using a
landline and here he's posing next to a
strangely appropriate sign that says if
you met my family you would understand
here's the thing Garland I haven't yet I
still do
the point is Marlin fondo is the most
likable thing about an otherwise
unlikable man look how George W Bush is
a perfectly fine painter or how Bill
Cosby raised awareness Americans
awareness of pudding or how Roger Ailes
is dead sometimes we can't deny but
there's one thing you like about someone
and bondo is actually about to get even
more attention the first tell-all book
to come out of the current White House
is hopping into bookstores Marlin bundo
the pet rapid a vice president Mike
Pence there he's signing a deal to
publish Marlin bundles a day in the life
of the vice president that is true
Marlin bando has a children's book
coming out this is it it's being
released tomorrow there's even going to
be a book tour and I would love to say
fine look it's a fun sweet book about a
rabbit who gives a but
unfortunately one of the stops on that
book tour is a focus on the
family
so congratulations pence you even
managed to ruin marlin bond oh now none
of us can enjoy a book about your rabbit
or can we because it turns out in a
complete coincidence we also wrote a
book about Mike Pence's rabbit that has
also been published in fact while he's
out tomorrow
right now now there are a few small
differences between the two books you'll
notice right away that our rabbit has a
bowtie so there's that also our story is
about Marlon bunt Oh falling in love
with another boy rabbits because our
Marlin Bonzo is gay the point is you can
actually bite this book starting right
now at Amazon and at better Bongo book
calm which should be easy enough to
remember if you want the regular Bongo
book with a better bundle book it's a
better bond o book calm all of our
proceeds from dicks are going to The
Trevor Project which provides crisis
intervention services for LGBTQ youth
and aged 90 which works to end the AIDS
epidemic in the United States for those
are two great reasons to buy this book
another is that selling more books than
pence
will probably really piss him off so
that's three great reasons right there
you can also buy an audiobook at
audible.com featuring Jim Parsons Jesse
Tyler Ferguson
Jeff Garlin Ellie Kemper John Lithgow
Jack McBrayer and RuPaul and let me be
completely clear about this this is
actual book for children this is a real
children's book this isn't some adult
book telling Mike Pence to go
himself although in buying it that's
exactly what you would be doing
is a sweet story about Marlon bundle
falling in love and to prove it here is
just a taste
hello my name is Marlon bundo and I am a
bunny this is the story of my very
special day as usual after breakfast I
hopped to the garden to look at the
flowers that is when I saw him the most
beautiful bunny I had ever seen my name
is Marlon I said but my family calls me
Botes it's short for bunny of the United
States it's a long story
my name is Wesley and my family calls me
Wesley said Wesley we went on a long hop
together we hopped through the garden we
hopped right inside the old stuffy house
we hopped through very boring meetings
with very boring people at the end of
our hop
I said Wesley I don't want to hop
without you ever again and Wesley said
that's funny because I never want to hop
without you Marlon bundo ever again and
we both said we will get married and hop
together forever
[Music]
said the stinkbug you can't get married
the stinkbug was in charge
all the animals listen to him even
though he was very stinky oh boy
bunnies don't marry boy bunnies boy
bunnies have to marry girl bunnies but
don't worry we had a plan a plan that
involved all the animals in the garden
and if you want to know how the story
turns out you are going to have to buy
the book please buy it for your children
buy it for any child you know or just
buy it because you know it would annoy
mike pence you've been doing a nice
thing in a really dickish way and isn't
that the dream at the end of the day
again you can find it at better bundle
book con or if you would prefer at the
website focus on the firmly which we
also own now and additionally if you
prefer to donate directly to the trevor
project or 1898 if you make a donation
of 1199 or more you can get a free copy
of the ebook all the information is on
our website we've actually bought copies
but every member of our audience tonight
[Applause]
technology the thing that will
eventually make television so high-def I
will no longer be allowed to appear on
it and and I want to approach this
subject carefully because discussions of
any new technology tend to age very
badly as this news report from less than
five years ago shows the first users of
Google Glasses surely will not be the
last
I think it'll end up changing our
lifestyles you know changing the way we
interact with each other and just
changing the gesture instead of this it
will be that yeah it wasn't though it
was not that because for some reason
people didn't mind doing this with their
hands if the alternative was wearing a
stupid robot on their face all day the
point is it is dangerous to make
predictions about where tech is going so
that said tonight we're going to talk
about crypto currencies everything you
don't understand about money
combined with everything you don't
understand about computers the main
currency you've probably heard about is
Bitcoin it's been all over the news
because last year its value exploded
from around $1,000 at the beginning of
the year to 9,000 by November to nearly
20,000 by December Bitcoin became such a
hot topic that paparazzi started asking
celebrities about it what Michael Keaton
leaving a restaurant hey would you
recommend buying Bitcoin you know what's
funny I was just I got two different one
guy said yeah you probably want to
another friend of I said
not like it's a bad thing they just
don't know where it's gonna go
I'm gonna say you do not expect
conversations with paparazzi to be so
nuanced hey cardi B what are your
thoughts on the idea of universal basic
income well it could go a long way to
reducing inequality but I don't think
the American people would support the
tax increase necessary to fund it you
can read all about it in my book card
anomic s-- making Marnie Buddhist for a
new American Century and this this was a
traumatic shift it was just a few years
ago you'd only hear about Bitcoin from
that one guy in your office who wouldn't
shut up about it let's call him Dan and
the reason that we're calling him Dan is
that Dan is the exact guy in our office
who's been annoying everybody with his
you've got to get into Bitcoin for
years this is why we hate dad it's
honestly not the only reason but it's
the easiest one to bring up right now
the point is lately more and more normal
people or non Dan's have been getting
into crypto currencies partly because
they may have seen stories like this
Dylan Fein is living the dream had their
Mitsubishi Eclipse my windows didn't
work my AC didn't work right I had to
open my doors just to get food at the
drive-through everything changed when he
met a friend who introduced him to
Bitcoin
I turned 350 dollars into 12,000 he
became a millionaire at 24 all by
investing in Bitcoin I can literally put
in a trade wait a few hours let the
exchange rate fluctuate and I'm actually
able to profit from the world's largest
financial market in the world yes that
man is apparently a millionaire now
which is presumably why he's being
interviewed on the most expensive
outdoor swamp log in South Florida and
despite the fact that Bitcoin has
dropped by nearly half since the start
of this year there is still a
cryptocurrency fervour going on with
people watching people like that guy get
rich or hearing about others on reddit
or Twitter and feeling driven to invest
in crypto due to FOMO or fear of missing
out now FOMO is a term that many of you
probably already knew about but I'm 40
years old British and oblivious or Theo
BOE so so with all this excitement and
curiosity we thought we'd try and
explain a few things tonight Bitcoin
blockchain the technology that allows it
to exist
crypto currencies in general and I'm
going to be simplify things a lot here
so let's start with Bitcoin which is a
digital decentralized currency that
basically means Bitcoin only exists as
computer code and there is no bank or
government creating or controlling it I
know that this is already a little hard
to understand so I'll let this man in a
Bitcoin suit give you a surprisingly
decent explanation I'm a virtual
currency worldwide you can send for
little to no fees open source not
controlled by any government corporation
or individual financial freedom bro
thanks bro that is a nuanced and
accurate explanation of a complex topic
delivered with the help of a man in a
stupid costume and I would love to make
fun of that except it's literally the
entire business model of this
television show I know you you may at
this point be thinking but wait how do
you make money from Bitcoin to which Dan
would say he just traded on exchanges
like any other currency and if you then
asked well how does it have value Dan
would reply how does any money have
value man and then he'd say call me the
brain for later because I just blew your
 mind to which you'd say forget I
asked Dan you're absolutely gross I hate
you but the problem is Dan is kind of
right
like most currencies the fundamental
reason the Bitcoin has value is because
people agree that it has value in fact
at the moment it's really being treated
more like a speculative investment than
a currency think of it like beanie
babies why is this beanie baby currently
being offered for sale on Etsy at a
price of $15,000 well because its owner
thinks that someone will pay that for it
and you know what that owner was
absolutely right I'm kidding I'm kidding
I'm kidding I just bought this at a yard
sale for ten thousand dollars I'm not a
complete idiot
look what well a Bitcoin is very
interesting as a concept there are still
some complicated technical issues to
work out before it can become a useable
everyday currency just look what
happened in January
hundreds are in Miami this week for a
Bitcoin conference but it had to stop
taking Bitcoin as a payment
tickets last week suggesting there are
still some kinks to work out with the
currency it's true a Bitcoin conference
stopped taking Bitcoin which is a red
flag since that's the one place you'd
think it would be accepted it's like
when I tried to pay for access to the
Republican National Convention using
Ronald Reagan's dusty skeleton boats
everyone there agreed they had value
there just wasn't an adequate network in
place for the completion of our
transaction but where the Bitcoin
catches on or not many people believe
that the really exciting thing about it
is the potential of the innovative
technology that it's built on and that's
something called blockchain now normally
if I wanted to send money to someone
across the world a bank would need to
verify that transaction and it could
take days but with Bitcoin it is vastly
faster because no Bank is involved and
that is because blockchain technology
allows a record or a ledger of every
Bitcoin transaction ever made to be
stored not in one place but across vast
numbers of computers that is part of
what people mean when they say bitcoin
is decentralized and decentralization
has a lot of theoretical advantages from
speed to security the key point here is
that this is a distributed ledger there
is no central server all the other
legends that we have all banking
Ledger's all company'll edges they all
sit and reside inside that company which
means they have one point of attack they
can be hacked JP Morgan was was hacked
by cyber thief's not so long ago
Home Depot target we've had all these
companies get hacked it's actually
because there's one central repository
of information the Bitcoin ledger
resides on thousands of computers you
can't hack that when you think about it
that sounds great and because of the
complicated process the network uses to
verify records it is very secure now
relax I'm not going to get into what
that process is or how it works but I
will share a really helpful really dumb
metaphor for why it is safe the way I
like to think of it is that a blockchain
is a highly processed thing sort of like
a Chicken McNugget and if you wanted to
hack it it'd be like turning a Chicken
McNugget back in
with chickens now someday someone will
be able to do that but for now it's
going to be tough hold on that is an
absolutely horrible thought so why is
that reporter so happy about the idea
because if anyone ever figures out how
to turn a Chicken McNugget back into a
chicken that chicken is going to be
 up he's going to spend the rest
of his life suffering from PTSD and
writing haunting poetry about the
experience the things I saw
buck-buck-buck or my body is whole but
what of my soul so very basically that
is the blockchain a database that is
nearly impossible to hack or tamper with
and which could possibly improve
security efficiency and trust that is
why big companies like Walmart IBM and
JP Morgan haven't been experimenting
with blockchain as a way to potentially
share and secure data trend and
translation transactions in a reliable
easy to access way but it is still very
early no one yet knows what blockchain
is really capable of honestly don't
worry if you still don't understand it
most people don't dan thinks he does and
sure he'll throw around terms like
supply chain management and it makes me
want to punch him in his face
stop leaving printouts of reddit threads
on my desk Dan you know I'm just
throwing them away I am you the problem
is there is no enough excitement around
the very word blockchain that has become
a magnet for investment reuters found
that existing companies that merely
added the word blockchain to their name
saw their stock price on average
increase more than three folds and one
of them was particularly dumb Long
Island iced tea renamed themselves long
blockchain and guess what happens yeah
their stock tripled
Wow I'm just gonna say it to people who
watch markets this seems so stupid it's
not even worth reporting yeah well I
don't care how stupid it is it clearly
works that is why from now on this show
will be called last bit tonight with
blockchain even triple the ratings
triple take that too
so so now at this point you know
basically what bitcoin is it's the
future bro and why people are excited
about blockchain it won't let people
chicken up your nugs but you might still
be wondering well what about all the
other cryptocurrencies that I've heard
about okay well the key software to
create a coin is open source meaning
that just about anyone can create one so
they have done that there are now over
1500 cryptocurrencies that you can buy
with names like tits coin trump coin
jesus coin insane coin electro neum wax
particle deep onion snow vo pluton new
bits and clams a list so insane that you
can't tell which ones are real and which
are made up because they're all real I
didn't make any up I tried to come up
with a dumb name than deep onion and it
just can't be done and look not all of
these coins are like Bitcoin just hoping
to be the next currency often times
startup companies will sell a coin to
try and raise money as an alternative to
issuing stock and sometimes those coins
are meant as tokens to be used for
services that the startup might
eventually provide kind of like the
tokens at Chucky Cheese only virtual and
not redeemable at a rat based food
emporium
it has become incredibly easy to issue
coins so companies are doing it a lot
initial coin offerings or icos raised
over six billion dollars in 2017 with
one company raising thirty five million
in under 30 seconds normally when
someone makes that much money that fast
they did it by walking up to Bill
O'Reilly sitting in silence for 26
seconds and then saying I recorded our
phone calls but but the vast majority of
people buying these coins are not paying
much attention to the details of the
startups they're attached to Theatre is
responding to the huge fervor and there
is a lot of it there was an entire
online subculture of YouTube
personalities and subreddits that have a
cult-like devotion to buying these coins
and if you stumble into one you'll find
they have a whole shorthand one key term
is Hodel based on a misspelling of holes
this is a foundational principle don't
sell when prices drop instead
Hodel in the face of food fear
uncertainty and doubt otherwise you
might miss out when the coin moons or
rockets up in value meaning you'll get
rekt or lose money and never be able to
afford the traders ultimate goal a Lambo
which is short for Lamborghini because
of course it is and if you are
thinking that these terms belong in a
rap video some crypto traders agree
I ain't got time for the haters man we
about to grow to a million
tell me how you down with the cool and
I've got to be honest there it is hard
not to watch that and deep down one to
be in the Hodel gang Hodel gang Hodel
gang Hodel gang the point is many people
are buying coins for no reason other
than that other people are buying them
and this mania has gotten to the point
where even a coin started as a complete
joke like dogecoin can rock it up in
value it's named after an internet meme
that was popular at the time a photo of
shiba inu with colorful comments written
in broken english around it as you can
see now dodge coins
total market value has almost doubled
since the start of this year to over two
billion dollars there appear to be no
obvious reasons for this yeah that's
because there were no obvious reasons
the whole point of the coin was to make
fun of how people will buy anything and
then people did exactly that that is no
less ridiculous than if you started a
joke band after the beatles called the
waffles that was all st. Bernard's and
they went on to have 40 number-one hits
and one knighted by the Queen this is
clearly ridiculous but for investors
it's also potentially dangerous because
right now this market is essentially the
Wild West and ripe for exploitation for
instance it can be easy to manipulate
the value of certain coins through
things like pump and dump schemes
regulators crackdown on those when they
happen with stocks but they've been
slower to act in the crypto market and
that may explain where some groups have
felt perfectly comfortable posting
videos like this welcome to crypto calls
a leading crypto currency pump room
where we skyrocket the value of coins
for six hours at a time for information
about our weekly pumps including the
the point we are pumping follow our
telegram channel once released be sure
to buy the coin as quickly as possible
and everyone in the group has purchased
the coin we will begin advertising it to
other investors on social media during
the final hour outside investors will
fill our orders as they follow into the
coin that we have increased in value
1000 to 2000 percent by the time the 4-6
hours is up everyone in our group will
have sold for props crypto calls
together we profit holy it's kind
of destabilizing just a brazen
advertisement for something that you
could have sworn was illegal it's like
watching a commercial and hearing hey do
you not have a child do you want
somebody else's then kidnappers corner
is the group for you here a kidnappers
corner we take children that are not
ours and bring them home with us it's
easy-peasy toddler cz and look pumpkin
dumps are just the beginning here there
are dodgy companies everywhere some of
which just look like old school frauds
with some crypto sauce poured on top
take a bit connect at one point it was
worth around three billion dollars now
big connect told investors that if they
handed over money they could get returns
as high as 40% a month and a rate of
return that high may immediately seem
suspicious to you but remember the
market was soaring and picking X had
excited investors like this guy who
spoke at one of the conferences
[Music]
let me tell you that we are really
changing the world as we know it the
world is not anymore the way used to be
no no because
[Music]
I
[Applause]
yes the last time I saw someone that
irrationally exuberant about a major
commitment he was roughly seven years
away from divorcing Katie Holmes yeah I
don't blame him for anything there he's
got a good head on his shoulders you
stay clear Tommy stay clear my boy
now that man that man's passion has
become famous in the crypto world as
well as his conviction that the business
he become involved in was 100% legit
this was gonna be a scam again then I
said to myself in thousand Dossett ding
you're right on her you know Taylor
Oh women I'm all right always nagging
you not to get sucked into
get-rich-quick schemes leaving your
marriage in the state of financial ruin
now this will not surprise you big
connect essentially collapsed regulators
in two States issued cease and desist
orders and bit connection reporters
who've been labeled a Ponzi scheme by
many in the industry something nobody
had any reason to suspect from their
promotional material except that it
featured this actual illustration of
their bonus system which seems to just
be a picture of a man coming up with the
idea for a pyramid scheme I am NOT
saying that every crypto poin is a scam
just as I'm not saying that every
blockchain company is what I am
saying is in a speculative mania it can
be incredibly hard to tell which
companies are for real and if you want a
good example of this just look at block
one it's a start-up whose coin offering
has so far raised one and a half billion
dollars which will go toward developing
a new type of software project called
Yost now just for context it took
Facebook seven years to raise a billion
dollars from investors it took over five
years Yost surpassed that in around nine
months and that is despite the fact the
Wall Street Journal described block one
as a software startup
that doesn't plan to sell any software
and describes what it's certainly a
digital token is having no purpose and
while the company's sister Els will be
the most powerful infrastructure for
decentralized applications which they
say will be usable it it hasn't lost yet
so you sort of just have to take their
word for it and they do talk a big game
everything will be better faster and
cheaper
everything will be more connected
everything will be more trustworthy
everything will be more secure
everything that exists is no longer
going to exist in the way that it does
today everything in this world is about
to get better
oh please douche everything that exists
will no longer exist in the way that it
does how the is Yoast going to
change this iguana how is how is a OS
going to both alter and improve Susan
here
[Music]
the NRA a group that feels about guns
the way the rest of us feel about
natella a little is good more is better
and you can tell me it's bad for me all
you like but you will pry it from my
cold dead hands now in the wake of the
parklands shooting the NRA has found
themselves in the spotlight once more
however the public pressure this time is
actually starting to take a toll Twitter
users are pressuring companies
affiliated with a gun rights group by
using the hashtag boycott NRA so 15
companies have cut ties with the NRA
after Parkland I think we have a list of
them here some big ones you know Delta
United a Viet hurts basically saying
they're no longer going to provide
discounts to the NRA yes ie this budget
and Hertz will all stop providing
discounts to NRA members which will
presumably come as a huge blow to Jeremy
the one NRA member who was just in it
for the rental cars but the boycott
train hit a bit of a snag when it ran
into one of the NRA lesser-known side
ventures one group that hasn't been
swayed yet big tech companies like Apple
Amazon and Roku you see these companies
streaming services still offer access to
NRA TV the gun lobby groups free online
channel focused on pro-gun content okay
so that is an uncomfortable situation
for Apple and Amazon but it's a
miracle for Roku hurry hurry get in here
someone just called us a big tech
company they said like Amazon and Apple
it's happening Harry
all of the discussion this week of
boycotting NRA TV we thought it might be
worth answering the question what the
 is that
because the truth is you may have
actually seen tiny bits of its
programming without even realizing it
like when this video featuring NRA
spokesperson Dana lash went viral just
last year they use their media to
assassinate real news they use their
schools to teach children that their
president is another Hitler the only way
we stop this the only way we save our
country and our freedom is to fight this
violence of Lies with a clenched fist of
truth yes the clenched fist of truth
which if you're looking for it is just a
little past the bent elbow of nonsense
and hiding in the overstuffed pocket of
needlessly aggressive metaphors now if
you miss that one you may have seen
another one that made the rounds during
the Obama administration featuring
country music legends Charlie Daniels to
the Hyatt olace of Iran and every
terrorist you enable listen up you might
have met our fresh-faced flower child
president is we need Ivy League friends
but you have a better America you
haven't been to Heartland
where the people will defend this nation
with their bloody calloused bare hands
you haven't meant to Steelworkers the
hard rock miners or the swamp folks in
Cajun country who can wrestle a
full-grown Gator out of water you
haven't met the hill demons who can
curse you and your future offspring just
for having a picnic in the wrong place
you haven't met the lake dog
he's a dog who lives in a lake for
reasons too complicated to get into at
the present moment and you haven't even
met the Gators down in Cajun country who
tiptoe out of the water at night and
take revenge on the swamp folk while
they sleep thus perpetuating the sick
cycle of swamp folk Gator violence
that's the America I know and I promise
you you're gonna be confused another one
of their promos was passed around online
and you may recognize one of the faces
in it and drinking as many as 12 diet
cokes the Second Amendment is about a
militia and it's the National Rifle
Association we are the press who's under
attack the president is like a child
certain people shouldn't have guns how
stupid do you think we are bless your
heart
[Applause]
[Music]
now don't laugh he's absolutely right
and if NRA members are annoyed with what
I'm saying right now they should do the
exact same thing and smash their
expensive televisions with large
sledgehammers are you listening NRA
members destroy your own property it's a
really good idea and it's honestly the
only way we'll learn now NRA TV produces
a lot of videos like those that are
essentially just trolling for your
attention but their content goes much
much deeper than that as you will see if
you go to their website or if you watch
it on streaming devices like the great
and powerful Roku NRA TV has news
programming and there's honestly not
really much point in our showing you any
of that because it's essentially just
Fox News on a much lower budget what is
what is more surprising is they make
shows lots and lots of shows and they
are so much stranger than you would
think so tonight let's watch some NRA TV
together because it's fascinating
now some shows are pretty similar to
ones that you would see anywhere on TV
with the key difference that there is a
gun involved
for instance they have three different
Antiques Roadshow knock-offs in which
men who look like this guy gets
progressively more and more aroused by
the guns they're holding what's unique
is that it has such flowing lines its
artwork it's a sensuous gun that's the
kind of pistol that when I hold or when
John is holding it gives me shivers the
idea was is that you in town talk both
hammers yes same time that man is duck
Wicklund and I love him but not as much
as he loves guns in fact the only way he
could love them anymore is if instead of
bullets every gun just fired a bunch of
little guns which in turn fired a bunch
of even smaller guns which in turn fired
tiny dog Wicklund living in a state of
sexual ecstasy inside the womb like
paradise of a firearm and while that
show is pretty sedate NRA TV also has
programming for the testosterone-fueled
gun enthusiasts like Media Lab in which
a former Navy SEAL named Dom Rosso
the very important work of reenacting
movies he likes from White House down to
Jack Reacher and here he is reenacting
scenes from the movie heat the main part
of this movie that I wanted to break
down was the fact that they're shooting
moving and communicating and if we get
past the fact that they're robbing a
bank if you're actually in a specific
uniform with specific kit can you shoot
move communicate with that amount of
weight and do down mandrills that's the
key thing here I would love to see a
bank robber I try to use that defense in
court Your Honor I really feel we need
to get past the fact that we were
robbing a bank and instead focus on how
well we were shooting moving and
communicating and the endearing thing
about Dom Rosso is that he shows
reenactments don't always go smoothly
for instance how did his reenactment of
the heat robbery go they make it look
easy the way they're moving there this
Bay has that was run was just hitting at
the back of my knees have taken my legs
out from underneath me definitely
fatigued me my strap broke so I was
holding it like this the entire time
wobbling back and forth even in the
beginning couldn't get a stable shooting
platform and we worked it out had to
lower my center gravity more so the bag
couldn't control me
we definitely proved that they didn't
have any weight in there while they were
shooting move it wow that is genuinely
inspiring because somewhere out there
there's an eight-year-old
watching that show and thinking oh good
being an adult is literally exactly how
I imagined it honestly I could talk
about Dom wrestle all night but before
we move on I have to show you his
inexplicable response to one viewer
submitted question what is your most
treasured possession I would say my art
gave me a cross that was made out of
bone she's like your
great-great-grandfather gave that to me
to pass down to somebody special in the
family but it was actually made out of
human bone and he carved it when he was
a prisoner of war
and that has been passed down on the
family now Mike are you serious I'm like
it just doesn't exist so that's probably
by far the coolest thing they have
well that's a hell of the story verdad
and I just don't know of any better
poster boy for the NRA than someone who
reenacts bank robberies for fun and
whose most treasured possession is a
cross made out of human bones but look
NRA TV isn't all gun bros there's also a
large amount of content aimed explicitly
at women there's even a whole women's
channel featuring shows like armed and
fabulous the NRA is actually making a
big push for women and they are pretty
clear about their motivations women
really have an incredible growth right
now in the NRA they are excited they're
enthusiastic they're there for us and
that's you know if you get the woman you
get the family if you get the woman you
get the family that is a brazenly
transparent statement of your marketing
strategy but to be honest can we just go
back to that room for a second did you
find that room relaxing is that a
soothing space for you
because I would be a little disturbed by
the extended family of gazelles
screaming why at me with their dead
glassy eyes now one of the NRA's female
focus programs love at first shot is
explicitly about getting women more
comfortable with the idea of owning or
firing guns and in one episode they took
a woman who was nervous about firearms
and really threw her in the deep end
they were gonna go straight into rifles
I'm gonna do it with an ar-15 okay I
know you've probably heard about them on
the news yes I hit the target you did
not as scary as I think I was
anticipated exactly it's just a nice
light push happiness yep a light puffs
of happiness it's a little weird to
describe a semi-automatic rifle the way
Bob Ross describes a cloud
but but once love at first shot has
women hooked the upselling begins which
does actually make sense industry
research has shown that women will spend
hundreds of dollars on accessories in
addition to their guns so you can kind
of understand why love at first shot
functions as a kind of QVC for firearms
showcasing products like mag loaders
targets gun cases and handbags okay so
as you see here I've got a couple of
different style options for you there
are a lot of different varieties of
exteriors but a lot of them really have
the same structure in terms of concealed
carries I never would have imagined
these little neat pockets and hidden
closures knowing that you can close it
it does put my mind at ease of that so
it's pretty cool go you don't even need
a gun because people are going to die
when they see that bag and look it's not
just handbags even the gun itself can be
profitably accessorized so yes we do
have a custom line of gun paint for the
ladies out there these mags look
phenomenal I love this product it's so
much fun to work with and it's great to
be able to put your own personal touch
on your firearms and your accessories oh
that's so fun that is so fun
oh if natalie ever commits murder a
grave oversight
good news chief the mag says the
killer's name right on it we don't know
what motivated them to go on a killing
spree but we do know she had a lot of
fun with it we've watched every single
episode of love at first shot and I have
to show you our favorite clip it's from
season 2 episode 1 the host natalie is
pregnant at this point so she can't join
in on the shooting but that doesn't mean
they didn't find a way to get her
involved we are going to make art for
Natalie since she couldn't be on the
range with us we're gonna do something
special for her to hang in her baby
nursery we know that you're expecting
obviously really thought we would make a
little something for it the baby's
nursery they shot paint so when somebody
inevitably asks why you have what
appears to be a blank canvas with a
large blood stain hanging up in your
Charles nursery you'll be able to
completely reassure them by saying oh
yeah my friend shots that for me but it
is not all fun with guns where an RA T V
really comes into its own is when its
tongue gets much darker which it does
for instance they have a series of
hunting videos which shouldn't be
surprising in fact it makes complete
sense people do use guns when they hunt
but while the visuals are predictable
Beauty shots of nature the voiceover
takes a different path somewhere over
this horizon sit a million little
dictators eager to purge humanity of its
hunting instincts the anti hunters had
imposed a false quarter
their lives based on a misconceived
perception of the world death is evil
they believe and so the purveyor of
death must also be evil death is an
undeniable fuel of life oh boy
God that is less planet Earth and more
deranged letter from a serial killer
although to be honest I would respect
the NR a a lot more if its slogan were
just the NRA because death is an
undeniable fuel of life I would like it
but at least we be clear where they were
coming from and that flowery vaguely
threatening tone is a key feature of NRA
TV here is another weird example hidden
beneath the dense canopy of deciduous
trees as a prostitute of sorts and those
who profit by selling her will stop at
nothing to exploit her sold and promoted
for her non-addictive even medicinal
advantages what lies behind the veil of
this seductress is far different than
what she first appears to be she is a
Harvard and her name is Mary Jane
[Music]
I didn't think this was possible but I
think that guy's just slut-shamed
marijuana and don't get me started on
mushrooms those filthy tramps they'll
grow next to any tree at all pause with
spores that's what I call them and if
you are wondering why NRA TV is even
talking about drugs at all the final
defining characteristic of the network
is painting a bleak vision of America
with threats around every single corner
and one solution next attack on our soil
could come in a matter of minutes
teenage girls are trafficked in sex
trade today's America is plagued by
urban riots and domestic Isis
sympathisers a natural disaster
you may call 9-1-1 and there may be
nobody on the other line the drug
cartels and the human traffickers who
have invaded our borders and embedded in
every single American city this threat
is real
our leaders are either incapable of or
unwilling to protect you and the ar-15
is one of the most effective tools
available to protect yourself and your
family holy they're using the same
techniques as an infomercial there is
human traffic getting you down do you
have Isis sympathisers in those
hard-to-reach places being tired of
getting 911 s there's got to be a better
way try the ar-15 available at way too
many stores near you now to watch NRA TV
is to watch a constant stream of stories
like those many of them real but
amplified to terrify you and sell you
products and there may be a good reason
that it sounds like an infomercial
because it is many of NRA TV shows are
sponsored by gun brands like Smith &
Wesson and behind the scenes of NRA TV
is an ad agency
it's called Ackerman McQueen they've
worked with the NRA for decades and the
Ackerman McQueen web site proclaims
every brand must be its own media
company and that is what the NRA have
done with their TV arm they've got a
product to sell and they employ people
who can sell that product well even Dana
lash the clenched fist of truth when
she's not warning a
the drug cartels and human traffickers
in every single American city
she's just selling you some other
hi i'm dana lash from the danish oh
there's one super food i drink every day
for healthy circulation and to make me
feel great all day long it's called
super beats and you can try for yourself
risk free i take super beats as my
pre-workout in the morning and as a non
jittery pick-me-up in the afternoon and
just one teaspoon of super beats gives
you the benefit of three whole beets Wow
Dana 3 whole beets
that's more than my delicious superfood
medium beats it gives you the benefits
of two whole beets which is and this is
true enough that's a perfectly adequate
number of beats the point the whole
point here is the answer to the question
what the is NRA TV is it's just a
vessel to sell America guns that's
pretty much it does it work it's
honestly hard to say they won't reveal
their rating so it's plausible that no
one is watching this and that that ad
agency akima McQueen are making out like
bandits
but look having having watched a
shitload of NRA TVs programming here is
what I'll say about it there is a lot to
be concerned about regarding the NRA s
activities but NRA TV might actually be
the dumbest most transparent thing that
it does think about it this way if the
NRA is a ferocious bear charging at you
NRA TV is that Bears ridiculous hat is
it i catching sure it is is it
perversely entertaining absolutely is it
the main thing you should be worried
about probably not because the real
truth here is hat or no hat it is
imperative that everyone keep their eyes
on that bear and now this and
now proof that NRA TVs tone can make
anything seem scary has your kitchen
that once believed in the south glow of
dawn
become a bleak gulag of countertops bent
and shameful submission to breakfast
perverse tyrant she is the ovens
contemptible and her name is
muffins the muffin is a gluttonous
prison each very a fruit slave within
its crusty walls Americans once relished
our right to a stack of flapjacks and a
cup of joe but now we tremble before
satan's cupcakes uncut and flapjacks
unstacked muffins rise we must rise
against death because you don't know the
muffin man america and you better pray
you'd never do pancakes the undeniable
fuel of life oh thank you so much for
watching see you next week good night
[Applause]
[Music]
Italy the country that gave us spaghetti
the Colosseum and in a roundabout way
the guy who played turtle so it's a rich
tapestry that's basically what I'm
saying now Italy is holding an election
next Sunday to select a new Parliament
and eventually a new Prime Minister and
you're probably thinking at this point I
don't even know who Italy's current
Prime Minister's I assumed it was just a
Vespa in a tank top well don't be too
hard on yourself there has been a lot of
them this will actually be Italy's 65th
government in just over 70 years so at
that rate is probably hard for Italians
to remember who their leader is for the
record it's this man also for the record
it's not that man I just typed Italian
man into a stock English sight and he is
what came up but this election is coming
at a pivotal time for Italy and the
run-up to it has been toxic Italy is
seeing a rise in political violence
ahead of its national elections on March
4th on Thursday riot equipped police
fired water cannons and tear gas as they
clashed with far-left
protesters marching against a nearby
neo-fascist rally over the past month
there have been series of political
motivated stabbings and beatings in some
Italian cities it's true Italy is in
turmoil and is dabbling with fascism and
that should worry everyone because the
last time they did that they wound up
with Mussolini VIII to put it nicely
Turner to Hitler's hooch and sadly the
conditions are right for fascism to
flourish there Italy is Europe's third
largest economy yet its public debt is a
hundred and thirty percent of GDP for
context that's second only to Greece and
the Bank of Greece is currently just a
goat dancing around an open fire
meanwhile unemployment is high and
politicians have been stoking
anti-immigrant sentiments as more than
600,000 migrants have landed on Italian
shores in the last four years and on top
of all of this italy is facing the same
problem that has plagued american
elections but that Etzioni Serio is a
senior editor at unser Italy's leading
news agency
he says fake news is exploding across
Europe he's such a danger that you know
figures like Pope Francis warn the press
not to spread you know what he actually
made a very strong parallel between a
thesis and this kind of news that's true
the Pope reportedly said fake news is
like getting sexually aroused by feces
it truly is a magical time to be alive
so it seems yet again a large European
country is teetering on the edge of
chaos and because of that it is worth
looking at the Italian election because
everything about it is fascinating and
let's begin with the key figures first
former prime minister Matteo Renzi he is
a centrist and he had to resign
dramatically after making a bold attempt
to reform Italy's political system a
referendum that did not go well for him
it looked quite bush out that I lost and
I said loud and clear even if I have a
lump in my throat I wasn't able to win
long live Italy and good luck to all of
us
wow that is ominous that's like a pilot
coming on over the loudspeaker and
saying well folks looks like old captain
Doug came up short this time anyway sit
back relax and good luck to all of us
and I would say that was Renzi's most
humiliating defeat but that honor really
has to go to his actual appearance in
the 90s on Italy's Wheel of Fortune
pollution a LAN party de Montaigne de
Acho a Merida Navi
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
look it is not good when the host is
joining in I know my only job on this
show is to move things along but the
people have spoken boo boo to you boo
Renzi is attempting a comeback but he's
gonna be facing an uphill battle as it's
at least experiencing a wave of
anti-establishment sentiment and that is
entirely understandable
the country has well-documented problems
with corruption and their government is
famously gridlocked and one of the most
interesting parties attempting to
harness this anger is called 5-star it
started just eight years ago in a very
unusual way he comes onto stage like a
rock star bet big Grillo comedian turned
fire-breathing curse flinging critic of
the status quo Grillo founded his
so-called five star movement first
railing on his blog and more recently in
piazzas across the country against
sky-high taxes Italy's legendary red
tape corrupt politicians greedy
businessmen and lazy bureaucrats that's
right five-star was started by a
comedian who organized demonstrations
called vaffanculo day which translates
to off day it is actually a pretty
great idea for a holiday Hallmark should
really take that concept and run with it
because I can think of a lot of people I
would like to send a card to
have since speck away from the party and
five stars candidate is 31 year old
Luigi DeMaio and I would argue that 31
is a little young to be the leader of a
major European nation to give you some
perspective on that DeMaio is one year
younger than Frankie Muniz and I do not
want him running Italy I don't even want
him running his own Twitter account
because two days ago he tweeted I have a
toothache come on Frankie sell your
brand do better boy the point is when
you see tomorrow in action he lives up
to your worst assumptions of what a 31
year old candidate for Prime Minister
could be what's the basis yet sell this
country is weighed down parties are a
weight with their conflicts of interest
we have to fly high bring this country
and make it fly high and this is why
today we will actually fly
[Music]
cool although to be honest that's not
really flying is it to be accurately
should have said the country is weighed
down with conflicts of interest so we
have to make Italy pathetically hover 20
feet off the ground while spinning in
circles and gripping in attendence hands
and while there is a lot to like about
some of five stars policies there is
also a lot to be concerned about because
while they are against a lot of things
it is much less clear what they actually
fall and in recent months they've shown
in ugly sides taking the increasingly
hardline stance regarding immigration
with DeMaio criticizing some rescue
efforts in the Mediterranean as sea taxi
services that must end in addition some
party members have engaged in vaccine
skepticism and Tamayo recently proposed
rolling back mandatory vaccinations for
children which is pretty dangerous
considering Italy saw nearly 5,000 cases
of measles including four deaths just
last year and that should not be
happening in this day and age it's like
hearing four people were trampled to
death in line at a blockbuster video how
did that happen
we're supposed to have collectively
moved past that by now now next there is
the leak
it's a far-right party led by Matteo
salvini who incredibly liked Renzi also
appeared on an Italian gameshow not just
as a twelve-year-old child but also
later again when he was 20 answering
trivia questions and racing around with
boxes on his feet and I do hope that you
enjoyed those clips because that is as
likable as salvini gets he has grown up
into a truly poisonous politician he
compared the female Speaker of the House
to an inflatable sex doll he's taken a
hard line on immigration saying out of
control immigration leads to drug
dealing
rape theft and violence and he is
trafficked in some pretty alarming
rhetoric he's owning up there's a need
for a mass cleaning even in Italy from
one street to the next from one
neighborhood to the next town square to
town square with strong methods if
necessary Wow
a mask leaning with strong methods he
sounds like a fascist Mary Poppins so
basic
MARY POPPINS and the frightening thing
is not all Italian voters are concerned
by salvini one told the New York Times I
like him because he puts Italians first
and I guess he's a fascist - what can
you do - it's the obvious answer is
don't vote for him that's literally the
only thing you should do and if you're
thinking at this point wait I think I
know someone who might really hit it off
with this guy well don't worry
of course they've met of course they
have oh I'm sorry you thought maybe
Trump would not pop up in this story
think again he is truly the Forrest Gump
of human misery but this is this is true
so we met with from saw in the 2016
campaign and Trump reportedly told
salvini that he hoped he would become
Prime Minister of Italy soon and I hope
sincerely that that does not happen
because Albania stone has attracted some
nasty followers just look at what
happened earlier this month the
far-right supporter in central Italy is
accused of opening fire on African
migrants on Saturday and wounding six of
them after the shooting he drove in
front of a war monument and made a
fascist salute wearing what looked like
an Italian flag
now that man in question reportedly
called salvini his captain and was one
of the league's candidates for a local
election last year which is awful
although it should be noted that in that
election he received no votes which
means not only did his family and
friends not vote for him he didn't even
vote for himself
even if you are a racist murderous piece
of if you run for anything you
shall at least get one vote or you're
just a idiot so in the midst of
economic uncertainty fake news and race
baiting it is clear that what Italy
needs is someone to step up and lead
them out of trouble I'm talking about a
bold new voice a fresh leader of
tomorrow so please show us Italy who
shall be your knight in shining armor
[Applause]
many thought he was politically finished
done but Silvio Berlusconi it's a list
full time Prime Minister it's making a
comeback
oh it's true he's back Silvio Berlusconi
sorry that's HPV Silvio Berlusconi sorry
that's just a condom filled with
marinara sauce Silvio Berlusconi has
returned and the most recent polls
actually had his coalition in the lead
so if Italy is seriously considering
taking Berlusconi back it is worth the
rest of us brushing up on him because he
is one of history's most ludicrous
humans his ego is legendary he once
claimed my greatness is without question
my human substance my history other
people dreamed to have and in the years
that Berlusconi was in power he built a
quasi cult of personality around himself
perhaps best exemplified by this
campaign song from 2008
[Music]
they're crazy
[Applause]
has to literally be silvio berlusconi's
fantasy a world where he's apparently
the only man left on earth and every
woman thinks about him whilst fondling
produce obviously what most people know
about Berlusconi can be summed up in two
words the word Bunga twice he famously
hosted sex parties which allegedly
featured scores of orgies and female
guests dressed up as nuns nurses and
even Barack Obama which is both deeply
weird and somehow deeply progressive
Silvio Berlusconi would like to explore
a mixed-race quasi homosexual experience
put on your pig monster but but that is
just the beginning he owns a stake in TV
channel some of which of broadcast shows
that have been criticized for their
course content including literally
treating women like pieces of meat but
that's not all he also owned a football
team called AC milan but couldn't even
talk to their players without getting
weird when are you going to introduce me
to your wife just to see her I'm old I
can't do it anymore
but because everyone says she is the
prettiest one oh what a terrific boss
hello there employee where's your spouse
I'd like to don't worry I'm too old
to her now otherwise I would though
we're having fun aren't we paid
subordinates we do have fun repressible
horndog is funny but it's worth
remembering those bunker bunker parties
allegedly featured a 17 year old girl
who Berlusconi paid for sex and when the
whole scandal broke his response was
less than charming Hashem pray y cuando
una activity' in interval to the
Illawarra I have always worked with no
interruption and if it sometimes happens
to me to see the face of a beautiful
girl I say better to like girls than to
be gay that's a terrible thing to say
and it's not even connected to the
terrible thing you're being accused of
he's basically Bernie Madoff saying hey
but it would be a complete crook than to
be Porto Rican you Bernie
did you just make this worse and on the
world stage Berlusconi's diplomacy left
a lot to be desired he joked more than
once the President Obama was tanned and
allegedly made a comment about Angela
Merkel that was so controversial he was
confronted about it in an interview that
was spectacularly awkward do you have a
particular problem with angular Merkel
is it true you called her an unfuckable
lard-ass I would never come
I have never in excuse me I have never
in 20 years of politics insulted anybody
ever
oh please play so real your words say no
but your face silence and history of
human interaction say see see and by the
way someone who looks like this should
never say a thing about anyone elses
physical appearance he looks like what
would happen if a smoked brisket
Andy Garcia Berlusconi's closest friend
on the world stage is unsurprisingly
Vladimir Putin they are so close that
Berlusconi wants gang Putin this actual
bedspread with a picture of them on it
which isn't just creepy it's pointless
we all know that Putin doesn't sleep in
a bed at night he just sits in a chair
and stares of the potato until it bakes
and if you think having a bedspread made
of you and your friend is childish
that's because Berlusconi is nothing if
he is not a gigantic child he even had a
remote-controlled volcano built in his
house featuring everything from fire to
artificial earth tremors this thing was
apparently extremely realistic because
at one point Berlusconi's neighbors were
so alarmed by the pelting flames they
called the fire brigade and i would love
to show you a photo of it but amazingly
we can't find one anywhere which is
insane because it's not like there
aren't hundreds of ludicrous photos
involving Berlusconi here is one of him
receiving a rifle from Gaddafi here is
one of him and Putin wearing matching
furry hats
and here is one of them dressed like
pitbull at a slumber party the point is
a photo of a belching in-home volcana
wouldn't even be in his top three
weirdest photos but what is even more
amazing about Berlusconi's comeback is
Italy was done with him he left office
after he was finally convicted of tax
fraud and his conviction in 2013
included banning him from serving in
public office for six years and I know
what you might be thinking now 2013 plus
6 is 2019 and we did crunch the numbers
on that all week and it turns out it is
a year from now so Berlusconi is still
banned and yet he's been going on a
charm offensive with videos online of
him either snuggling adorably with a
baby lamb or because it's Berlusconi
getting to second base with an
inappropriately young sheep and he's
positioning himself as a kingmaker in
this election and may well end up having
a key role in picking the next leader
and that is not good because his
alliance includes Matteo salvini the
game show fascist from earlier who could
well get a high-power position in the
new administration so really what I'm
saying is you have to feel for Italy
here because the outcomes do not look
good there are a lot of bad options
ranging from an awful Prime Minister to
know outright winner plunging Italy into
political limbo but but wait because
there's actually one more wild card here
under Italian law if the governing
coalition whoever that is could still
pick a non politician who's had nothing
to do with this campaign so far so it
could be some random jackass that Italy
has never heard of and if you don't see
where I'm going with this you've clearly
never seen this show before
because we asked half a dozen Italian
legal experts and while they told me
that I couldn't run for Prime Minister
of Italy they also admitted there is no
explicit provision in the Italian
Constitution that says non-citizens
can't run for prime minister so as far
as I'm concerned
we'll have ourselves an Air Bud scenario
remember the rules of basketball did not
explicitly state that he couldn't play
next thing you know the dogs dunking
well I am that dog Italy so alley-oop
 like me just as good a
leader as many of your political figures
you got a party started by a comedian
technically on one of those you like
politician to appear on TV with animals
please it's like Jumanji up in here
someone bring me my lambo little teacher
do you like this Italy of course you do
yes exactly
plenty more where this came from I've
got 40 lambs backstage thank you so much
thank you everybody
Italy you seem to like candidates of the
penis contestants on Italian game shows
well sadly I have not actually done that
however since you are swimming in fake
news over there I see absolutely no
reason not to lie and tell you that I
have here is me on an old Italian game
show
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
or Atari laughter Luciani pasta
primavera pasta primavera no no no no no
no buster
we gotta fast back
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
why did I go to the trouble of faking a
gameshow in which I lost I think deep
down it's just who I am
oh and one final thing Italy I know that
Berlusconi has a remote-control volcano
that he won't let you see
well Italia
[Applause]
before the awesome power
[Applause]
maybe a complete until the fast but be
honest incredibly I am part of your

Donald Trump the only president who
combines the sordid extramarital affairs
of a young JFK with the dead-eyed
puffiness of a post-watergate Richard
Nixon look I know we have talked about
Trump a lot on this show but tonight
we'd like to do it from a slightly
different angle and that is focusing on
his relationship with the world because
while we were away you may remember one
particular remark he made according to
the US president Africa is a
that's right he said that he absolutely
said that except to be fair to him it's
actually worse because he reportedly
called Africa Haiti and El Salvador
holes which is just not okay and I do
acknowledge that I personally have
called Belgium a multiple times
but in my defense a I'm not president
and be Belgium is a load some chocolate
gulag with no objective reason to exist
so you can see that it's very different
you can see that and look you probably
saw people on u.s. TV being justifiably
appalled by those remarks but what you
may not have seen is the response from
the countries he insulted honestly so
sure then she's like has he ever
we not sit home we people we just like
it is a yes because it doesn't
matter what you have he's still going to
the same hole we're the same worms will
eat into Wow
you know it says something about the
Trump era that the phrase the same worms
will eat into actually qualifies as a
hopeful thought I would honestly like
that crocheted on a pillow so I can wake
up to it every morning and look look it
is not like that's the only time that
Trump's remarks have caused an
international uproar he said that Korea
used to be part of China which outraged
South Koreans he claimed that Germany
owes NATO vast sums of money which it
does not and in the UK he retweeted
these anti-muslim videos from a
far-right British group which triggered
massive condemnation and instead of
fully apologizing for it he said it was
a big story where you are but it was not
a big story where I am and that is
exactly his attitude if it wasn't big
where I could see it then it wasn't big
so forget mastering foreign affairs
Trump may not have mastered object
permanence which you really need to be a
good president or even a good
baby and yet here is the crucial thing
the rest of the world continues to exist
whether Trump acknowledges or not so
tonight let's try and answer a few basic
questions at first what is Donald
Trump's foreign policy because it seems
to be little more than repeating a
single phrase America first America
first America first again America first
America first it will be America first
from now on
America first now if you are another
country watching that you may well be
wondering wait
when has America's attitude ever not
been America first they've been putting
America first since the day they arrived
in America very much second but say here
Donald Trump telling in recent years
we've been getting the short end of the
stick on the campaign trail he often
complained that America had become a
global punch line and promised that he
could reverse that the world is laughing
at us folks the whole world is laughing
at us they're laughing at this that's
what's going on in our country the world
laughs at us folks the world laughs at
us we're not gonna be a laughingstock
like we have been and we have been
believe me oh we're not going to be a
laughingstock anymore huh it is insane
that Trump this guy this guy this guy
thought he would end the laughter it's
like a flamingo in boxer shorts named
Phineas J rocket dump ran for president
under the slogan time to get serious now
for the record since Trump became
president if anything the world is
laughing harder than ever before because
while all US presidents do get made fun
of impersonating Trump has become an
international cottage industry Israel
has Trump kicking a Muslim man while
dancing lewdly to guns and roses Germany
has him dancing to Uptown funk
Spain has him flipping off the world and
again dancing like an idiot and there's
more here he is in Pakistan here he is
in Bulgaria here he is in Taiwan
here he is in Ethiopia here's a pretty
shitty one from Turkey where they're not
even trying
here's a Korean Trump and here's one
from an Italian comedy show see him born
in the USA on a stealth fighter before
being taken out with a bucket on his
head
are any of these funny I don't know is
anything about trunk funny anymore
somehow the world's most objectively
laughable human has become a comedy
graveyard when laughter goes to die and
in case you think any of that may have
been good-natured ribbing a recent
Gallup poll shows that the world's
approval rating of US leadership has
dropped to 30 percent after being at
nearly 50 percent just two years ago
that is a precipitous drop in popularity
is the equivalent of replacing gal gadot
in the Wonderwoman franchise with Matt
Lauer look I know I love the Donald
Trump and others may not give a
about what the world thinks about us but
they really should for a number of
reasons chief among them something
called soft power which yes I
acknowledge does sound like an erectile
dysfunction medication for chinchillas
so soft yet so hard but but basically
basically refers to the ability to get
others to do what you want them to do
without using carrots or sticks it's
kind of a country's brand and a nation
soft power can come from many sources
from your pop culture to the ideals you
express to your reputation and diplomacy
can play a major part in it even hard
power practitioners like Trump's own
Secretary of Defense Jim Mad Dog mattis
supports the soft power work that's done
by the State Department that is why a
few years back he gave a full-throated
defense of properly funding it frankly
they need to be as as fully funded as
Congress believes appropriate because if
you don't fund the State Department
fully then I need to buy more ammunition
ultimately now that is scary because buy
more ammunition is his way of saying
without diplomacy there will be more
Wars
he doesn't need more ammunition so he
can make more bullets earrings for his
Etsy store because he's not just
Secretary of Defense he also crafts
accessories for the elegant weirdo now
unfortunately though Trump has shown
little interest in soft power his
administration recently proposed a 29
percent cut to the State Department and
foreign aid and there are
any high-level vacancies at the State
Department to say nothing of our lack of
ambassador's from Belgium to Belize
South Korea to South Africa President
Trump has a problem
his embassies have no ambassador Turkey
Jordan Egypt Qatar and Saudi Arabia all
without ambassadors holy
South Korea Turkey and Saudi Arabia
those are countries where you really
need an ambassador it's not like Lipson
Stein where you can basically scrape by
with a sign that says never stop
Lichtenstein II and as for the
ambassadors that Trump has appointed
some of them are frankly not grapes when
Trump appointed Peter Hoekstra
ambassador to the Netherlands they were
a little upset over there as this
interview shows speaking of threat at
one point you mentioned in a debate that
there are no go zones in the Netherlands
and that cars and politicians are being
set on fire and then I didn't say that
that is actually an incorrect statement
yeah we would call it fake news okay
okay I didn't say that so and so he's
given himself some wiggle room there as
long as he didn't say exactly what the
reporter just claimed about no-go zones
and politicians being set on fire he's
technically correct the only thing in
the whole world
that would make him not correct is if
say video of him saying that cars and
politicians are being bird and that yes
there are no go zones in the Netherlands
there are cars being burned there are
politicians that are being burned and
yes there are no go zones in the
Netherlands it's pretty weird not to
recall saying out loud there are
politicians that are being burned in the
Netherlands it's not the kind of thing
that you do and immediately forget about
like driving to work or seeing the movie
the post I mean I have a vague memory of
walking into a darkened room eating Milk
Duds and thinking Meryl Streep is a
treasure but the rest is a complete
blank
but when Trump was asked about his
understaffed State Department he claimed
that it didn't really matter for one key
reason let me tell you the one that
matters is me I'm the only one that
matters because when it comes to it
that's what the policy is going to be
I'm the only one that matters the only
one that matters is me it's hard to tell
if Donald Trump is laying out a
diplomatic strategy or demanding that
daddy buy him an oompa loompa then his
actions are critical to our nation's
foreign policy and that brings us to our
next question how is his approach to the
world going and the answer surprisingly
is great and now this I'm kidding it's
been a disaster
in fact to give you a sense of how much
damage he can do in very little I can't
believe you nearly bought that he could
do a very little time just look at last
summer's back-to-back NATO and g7 summit
it was just three days of meetings in
which time he reportedly told European
leaders that quote the Germans are bad
very bad then shook Emmanuel krons hands
so aggressively it seemed like he was
trying to masturbate an elephants then
at the g7 conference the next day world
leaders unsuccessfully tried to convince
him to stay in the Paris climate Accord
and in the middle of all of that he gave
a speech where he failed to explicitly
reaffirm article 5 the basic principle
that NATO members should come to the aid
of each other when attacked affirming it
is routine for presidents and it was
even in Trump speech until being
apparently deleted at the very last
minute blindsiding top members of his
own national security team and after
witnessing Trump's erratic behavior for
just three days Angela Merkel was so
shell-shocked
she made this statement the times when
we could completely rely on others are
to an extent / I've experienced this in
the last few days and that's why we
Europeans must really take our fate into
our own hands that was the day after the
summit
I wasn't even supposed to give a major
speech that was at a campaign event held
in a beer tent and that means we're
probably lucky there was an event of any
kind otherwise she would have just
yelled out Europe is on its own at her
nephew's piano recital and this brings
us to our final question what are the
consequences of this well one big one of
them could be that there is a leadership
vacuum in the world so who will fill
that well in Europe the obvious
candidate is Germany but even they know
that there may be an issue with that
well whenever I talk to people in our
neighbor countries they mostly expected
sort of the leadership of Germany but on
the other side whenever I talk to the
people in these countries with a very
good memory what happened in the first
half of the 20th century they are very
reluctant talking about a German
leadership you're right you're right I'm
so glad that you brought that up because
I I didn't want to be the first one to
bring it up but you are absolutely right
when people hear Germany wants to take a
leading role in Europe most of us do
still think no they're still in timeout
and they know why they know what they
did not see Germany now now globally it
seems that China is set to be the
biggest beneficiary because they have
been aggressively seeking to increase
their influence and soft power something
that has not gone unnoticed a nation
head of government recently explained to
me that at every regional conference
Washington sends a couple of diplomats
whereas Beijing sends dozens the Chinese
are there at every committee meeting and
you are not he said the result he
explained is that Beijing is
increasingly setting the Asian agenda
it's true the u.s. is absent at many
important meetings and that doesn't even
include meetings that Jared Kushner was
supposed to attend but he couldn't find
a room and he was too shy to ask someone
and then he realized it was too late
anyway so he just killed an hour
wandering around the lobby pretending to
be on the phone
and the piglets China's increased
influence should be alarming because
they are an autocratic country you don't
necessarily want China setting global
priorities on things like human rights
and democracy and yet
Trump's reckless behavior is opening the
door to exactly that happening not to
mention the fact that what he's doing is
going to make it harder for him to
accomplish his own goals he wants to
contain North Korea or to do that you
might want to appoint an ambassador to
South Korea he wants Germany to spend
more on its military okay but maybe stop
publicly shaming Merkel if you want her
to be able to sell that idea back home
and it wants to contain security threats
like Isis and Al Shabaab in African
countries then maybe don't call African
countries shitholes truck can
say that he doesn't care because his
approach is America first but you need
allies to get anything done
foreign affairs is like sex if you
loudly announce that you will always
come first
you're going to have trouble finding
partners and as for on to other promise
that the world will stop laughing it is
not just comedians doing that it's world
leaders Australian Prime Minister
Malcolm Turnbull was a depressed in the
last year and he had himself a bit of
fun Donald I we are we and we
face pulse they're the ones we're not.we
we're waiting in the real balls get out
of the online bones
they also guy
that is a key ally using the fact that
our president is a pathological liar as
a punchline and crushing that room like
a fourth grader with a carrot stick
stuck up his nose anything think that
was grim let me show you one more clip
we found when we were looking for Trump
impersonators around the world this one
is from Russian TV with a comedian
making fun of Trump's suspiciously close
relationship to Putin and there is a fun
little surprise for you
just at the end Hillary the other day
Hillary asked me Donald do you love
Russia I answered yes I do I love Russia
but you have no evidence against me
by God that is as happy as I've ever
seen Putin ever I guess at least we now
know what type of humor that Putin likes
he likes the kind where he medals in
another country's election succeeds has
a joke about it made to his face in
public and then realizes it all worked
out no one can touch him that's the kind
of humor that Putin likes it just
creases him up look I know that all of
this is depressing because it seems like
America's reputation overseas is under
attack from its own president which is
just ridiculous soft power is an act of
salesmanship it's selling your brand it
is the one thing that Trump is supposed
to be good at and he's blowing
it
so as an immigrant who has fallen in
love with this country for what it's
worth please allow me to speak to the
rest of the world in America's defense
for a moment because Donald Trump does
not reflect America I mean to be to be
completely honest to be completely
honest who does reflect it a bit but the
point is America is not one thing it's a
beautiful mess of contradictions where
good and bad are mixed together on one
hand it makes Mountain Dew which tastes
like a honeydew melon was by a
radioactive cloud on the other hand it
also made this awesome bed shaped like
the Batmobile you can fall asleep in
that thing and be Batman if Batman
somehow got locked out of the Batcave
and had to sleep in his car but that's
the American dream right there America
is the country that came up with YouTube
which yes I know gave you in the world
that head Logan Paul but it also
gave you those videos of adults in t-rex
suits on dirt bikes ballet dancing
exercising and doing basic car repairs
and by the way that magnificent dinosaur
costume that's an American idea to that
the point is America is the country that
gave you Star Wars
you're welcome and Scientology who were
sorry about that and and sometimes
what's great and terrible about us is
just impossible to separate like look
Popeyes Chicken
it's objectively disgusting but I would
run across traffic to eat this but
the point is trevor is the worst of us
yes but he's not all of us if I did is
still America down to one sound it
wouldn't be the braying voice of Donald
Trump screaming America first it would
be the gorgeous voices of the New York
City gay men's chorus singing this song
[Applause]
that's right that's all star by
smashmouth a terrible stupid songs being
sung absolutely beautifully this should
be our new national anthem and so please
world
[Applause]
[Music]
embarrassment the country to incredible
dinosaur costumes
[Applause]
The presidency
of Donald Trump.
The man voted "Least Edible"
by Cannibal Magazine
-six years in a row.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-A-- And I know,
I honestly know
that the prospect
of talking about Trump yet again
feels exhausting.
We're all so tired of him,
every room in America
should have a sign
on the wall that counts
the number of minutes
that it's been
since someone brought up
his fucking name.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-But-- But that is the thing.
Trump's presidency
is like one of his handshakes.
It pulls you in,
whether you like it or not.
He's had so many
terrible moments this year,
you probably forgot about
many of them.
Remember when he creepily told
the French president's wife
-that she was in good shape?
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Or-- Or when his
tacky golf resort was touted
on the States Department
website?
Or, when he shoved
the prime minister
 of Montenegro out of the way,
 at a NATO event.
 Look how proud
 of himself he is!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Look how proud he is!
You should at least have to know
that Montenegro is a country
before making a move that says,
"Suck it, Montenegro."
And there were also quieter
but no less alarming moments
like when he explained how hard
he's been fighting
to bring "clean coal" back
without appearing to understand
what that actually is.
It's just been announced
that a second
brand new coal mine
where they're going
to take out clean coal,
meaning they're taking
out coal,
-they're gonna clean it,
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
is opening in the state
of Pennsylvania.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Listen, is it possible
that Trump is well-versed
in and is referring to
flue gas desulfurization,
fluidized bed combustion,
and selective
catalytic reduction?
Sure, it's possible,
but let's agree
it's considerably more likely
that he thinks you just
take a bunch of coal
and scrub-a-dub it
with a big ol' sponge.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Oh, yeah, that's right.
I'm saying the president
fundamentally doesn't understand
what he's talking about,
and you know what that means.
-We got him!
-(AIR HORN BLARING)
-♪ (PRESIDENTIAL
THEME SONG PLAYING) ♪
-We got him! We got him!
I got him-- wha--
I didn't get him?
-Did I not get him?
-♪ (MUSIC FLUBS OUT) ♪
I thought-- I thought--
I thought we got him.
I thought-- I thought we got him
that time.
Well, that's fair-- okay.
What? You think I don't
hate myself, too? Alright!
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
-The point is--
The point is tonight...
let's pull back
from the daily
Trump-induced chaos
and take a look at the norms
that his presidency
has violated,
and not the obvious ones,
like the fact that he never
released his tax returns,
or that his own daughter
and son-in-law
work in the White House,
although, admittedly,
I am using the word "work"
there so generously
that I should be able
to deduct it
as a charitable donation
on my taxes.
Or-- Or that instead
of putting his assets
into a blind trust to help
reduce conflicts of interest,
he simply showed America
that he has many
large stacks of paper,
presumable containing
the sentence
"I can't believe
I'm getting away with this,"
printed 750,000 times.
No, instead, we're going
to talk about Trump's assault
on something even more basic,
the norms governing
how our leaders engage
with us,
and how in turn,
that affects the way
that we engage with one another.
It's why even the notion
of "getting him"
can feel so hopelessly futile.
And let's first stipulate
that it definitely doesn't help
that so often what Trump says
is complete nonsense.
We often read transcripts
of Trump's speeches,
and it's something
that everyone should actually do
once in a while,
because when you strip away
his blindly confident
entertaining delivery
and just read his words,
it is staggering
how incoherent he is.
Here is a word-for-word
reading of a speech
where he talked about
the Iran nuclear deal.
(MONOTONE VOICE READS
ON-SCREEN TEXT)
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-(READING CONTINUES)
-(AUDIENCE CACKLING)
-Holy shit.
That is not a functional use
of language,
that is a drunk driver
crashing a pick-up truck
-full of alphabet soup.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Trump's actual speech patterns
sound like when you write
a long text
by choosing only
the predictive text
your iPhone suggests for you.
Seriously, we wrote
a message like that,
starting with the words,
"the nuclear,"
and here is what we got.
(MONOTONE VOICE READS
ON-SCREEN TEXT)
-(AUDIENCE CACKLING)
-That makes exactly as much,
and potentially more sense,
then Trump's speech
about the Iran nuclear deal,
meaning an iPhone
would be a more coherent
president of the United States.
But with Trump,
we are familiar enough
with his speech patterns
that you get the basic gist
of what he's trying to say.
The real damage isn't
in how he says things,
but from three key techniques
that he uses to insulate himself
from criticism and consequence.
And if we are not
extremely careful,
all three could have
serious impacts
that far outlast his presidency,
and let's start
with the first one.
Delegitimizing the media.
Now, Trump has been
attacking the press
since he declared
his candidacy,
and in a broader sense,
he's been waging war
on the very concept of truth
ever since he first
turned to his mom and said,
"Dada," and she said,
"No, I'm mama,"
and he said, "Fake news,"
and shit his pants.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Now--
the difference now is,
he's crying fake news
as President
of the United States,
and he is openly proud of it,
to the point that he recently
tried to take ownership
of the term itself.
The media is... is--
really the word--
I think one of the
greatest of all terms
I've come up with is "fake."
I guess other people
have used it perhaps
over the years,
but I've never noticed it.
-(AUDIENCE GROANING)
-He just took credit
for inventing the term
"fake news,"
which, for the record,
he did not,
meaning what he just said
was technically
"fake" fake "news" news.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
A-- And you can imagine
him saying, "Well,
I'm not the first politician
to criticize the press.
What about Hillary Clinton?
What about Barack Obama?
What about Bernie Sanders?
And that actually brings us
to Trump's second technique,
something called
"whataboutism."
It's the practice
of changing the subject
to someone else's
perceived wrongdoing.
Now, Trump does this
all the time,
most famously when he was asked
why he hadn't forcefully
condemned the neo-Nazis
in Charlottesville,
and this was his response...
What about the alt-left
that came charging
at the-- as you say,
the alt-right?
Do they have any
semblance of guilt?
What about the fact
they came charging--
that they came charging
with clubs in their hands,
swinging clubs?
Do they have any... problem?
Well, actually, no,
because a Nazi killing someone
with a car is so heinous,
any other issues that might
be up for debate,
under any other circumstances,
kind of have to wait their turn.
You can be wearing Crocs
with socks,
but if you're using
those socked-Crocs
to kick Hitler in the balls,
do you know what?
I'm suddenly not
so fucking focused
-on the footwear.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Now-- Now this technique
of saying "what about..."
is actually an old Soviet
propaganda tool,
and the reason it is dangerous
is because it implies
that all actions,
regardless of context,
share a moral equivalency,
and since nobody is perfect,
all criticism is hypocritical
and everybody should do
whatever they want.
It is a depressingly
effective tool,
which is why,
on Trump's favorite network,
you hear it all the time.
The mainstream media
focused on the Trump campaign
and allegations
of collusion with the Russians.
But what about the Democrat's
possible ties to Moscow?
FEMALE ANCHOR:
Former national security adviser
 General Michael Flynn,
 investigated for
his private meeting with Russia,
but what about Hillary Clinton?
The media wants to call
into question the credibility,
uh, and the trustworthiness
of this administration, uh,
but what about Benghazi?
What about the blatant lies
that the Obama
administration told us?
What about the fact that
Ben Rhodes bragged
about lying to the media
and the public
-about the Iran deal?
-HANNITY: Great point.
What about the fact that
Jonathan Gruber
basically said the
American people were stupid?
Okay, stop, stop, stop,
because here is the thing,
none of the errors those people
may have made in the past
excuse the Trump
administration's actions.
A defense attorney could not
stand up in court and say,
"Maybe my client did
murder those people,
but I ask you this...
What about Jeffrey Dahmer?
-What about Al Capone?
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
What about the guy from
the Silence of the Lambs?
I rest my case here, people.
I rest my case."
The problem with whataboutism
is it doesn't actually
solve a problem
or win an argument.
The point is just to
muddy the waters
which can make
the other side mad,
and that actually
brings us to Trump's
third technique... trolling.
Now trolling itself
has been around for years.
It's basically 80% of what
happens on the internet.
It's-- it's when a
YouTube commenter
says something
willfully provocative
like saying, "I've aged like
an apple core in a dumpster."
or that I "look like a fucking
pickle with glasses."
Now, it doesn't matter
whether they mean any of that,
the point is just to
get a reaction
and to hurt my feelings
which, by the way,
it absolutely does.
But-- But Trump... Trump may
well be the first ever troll
to be elected president.
And that's right,
I said elected.
Remember tenth president,
Sprinkles Fuzzwizard?
He assumed office after
William Henry Harrison died
and if you're thinking,
"Hold on,
Sprinkles Fuzzwizard was not
America's tenth president"...
Really?
Who was America's
tenth president?
Exactly. Let's assume
I'm right.
The point is, as a troll,
Trump often does things
that have no effect
other than
to piss off
his perceived enemies.
Like when he tweeted
this wrestling GIF
of himself
body slamming CNN,
or attacked Mika Brzezinksi
by saying she was,
"bleeding badly
from a face-lift,"
or, as we mentioned
earlier tonight,
called a leader
with nuclear weapons
"short and fat."
And Trump even once
retweeted a claim
that he was the most
superior troll
on the whole of Twitter,
calling it
"a great compliment."
Which it is not,
because sometimes
when you do something that
makes a lot of people mad,
it's because,
and bear with me here,
-you're a dick.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
If you-- If you sneak
into someone's house
and urinate
in every heating vent
and they get mad at you,
you're not an epic troll
sticking it to the
snowflake cucks,
you're just
some fucking asshole.
But the thing is,
Trump's trolling
is not actually without
political value.
Despite Trump's few real policy
accomplishments to date,
he has consistently achieved
one thing,
and that is making
his enemies unhappy.
And for many Trump supporters,
that itself counts
as a major victory.
Just listen to how
 Fox & Friends reacted
after Trump freaked
people out
by standing
with military leaders
during rising tensions
with North Korea,
and suggesting that it was
the "calm before the storm."
I feel like he's trolling
the media.
He is-- I think he's totally
trolling the media there.
You do something like that--
even the smile and the wink.
Those of us that are sick
of the status quo,
the forgotten men and women
who voted for President Trump,
want that town to freak out.
I want those reporters going,
"What do you mean?
What do you mean?"
It's beautiful to watch.
Is it?
Why?
I'm genuinely serious.
Who benefits from mass confusion
about whether or not
we're about to go to war?
Are there thousands of
unemployed factory workers
across the Midwest going,
"Well the plant closed down
and I lost my healthcare.
But somewhere,
a Washington Post reporter
is scared of dying,
so things are looking up. Mega!"
Judging your political success
on how bad you make
other people feel
makes just about as much sense
as judging your success
as a zookeeper
by how many bears you fuck.
Oh, wow, that is not
your job.
I mean, I guess it's impressive
in its own way,
but it is definitely not what
you're supposed to be doing.
And the surest proof of trolling
often comes
when a troll is confronted.
Because that's when
they have to either
put up or shut up.
You may have heard about
cases where
people tracked down the source
of something awful
that was posted online,
only to find
some sullen fifteen-year-old
who just shrugs and goes,
"Well I don't know why
I wrote that. I just did it.
Stop asking me so many
questions."
Well, that is basically
our president now.
I'll show you.
Remember when Trump said
that Obama had surveilled him
in Trump Tower, tweeting...
"How low has President Obama
gone to tap-p my phones?"
Watch what happens when he
was asked to justify that.
Well, you saw what happened
with surveillance
and I think that was
inappropriate.
-That's the way--
-What does that mean, sir?
Uh, you can figure that out
yourself.
Well I-- The reason I ask
is you said he was--
You called him "sick and bad."
Look, you can figure it out
yourself,
he was very nice to me
with words, but--
and when I was with him,
but after that
there has been no relationship.
But you stand by that claim
about him?
I don't stand by anything.
I just, uh...
You can take it the way
you want.
Okay, so let's walk through
what just happened there.
On the internet he claimed
that his predecessor
committed an extremely
serious crime.
But in person, he is suddenly
backing down.
First saying Obama was
"very nice to me with words,"
then that, "I don't stand
by anything."
Which is one of the most
frighteningly nihilistic
sentences a president can say.
I would honestly rather
hear that
from a clown holding a knife
than a president.
Because at least when
a clown says,
"I don't stand by anything,"
you think,
"Yeah, that kind of makes sense.
Please make it quick."
-And...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
And look, it gets worse, because
that interview kept going
and Trump was explicitly
given the opportunity
to set the record straight
for the "fake news media,"
but he flat-out refused.
I just wanted to
find out that--
You're the president
of the United States,
you said he was "sick and bad"
-because he attacked you--
-You can take it any way--
You can take it any way
you want.
-But I'm asking you, because you
don't want it to be fake news.
-You don't--
-I want to hear it from
President Trump.
-You don't have to ask me.
-You don't have to ask me.
-Why not?
Because I have my own opinions,
you can have your own opinions.
But I want to know
your opinions.
-You're the president
of the United States.
-Okay. That's enough.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
Okay, so...
There is a lot that is
infuriating about that clip.
But Trump going back to his desk
and pretending to work hard
is an objectively funny
thing to do.
That's like your dog
avoiding questions
by pretending to do his taxes.
You never do this,
why would you need
to do it now?
Look, while there is nothing new
about any of these techniques,
they are now coming out
of the Oval Office.
Which not only legitimizes them,
it risks them spreading,
and that, sadly, is happening.
Last month,
Congressman Paul Gosar
used all three techniques.
First, he suggested
in an interview
that the march
in Charlottesville
may have been
a false flag operation
created by the left, which is
pretty troll-y behavior.
And when confronted about it,
he deployed the other two tools.
-It's all been debunked.
-It's not been debunked.
Absolutely not debunked
whatsoever.
-So stay tuned.
-The conspiracy theory
that you have put out there
has been debunked.
It has not been debunked.
Look at-- Look at what CNN
has talked about with, uh,
with what's going on
with the Clinton administration
right now with the dossier.
Hardly an aspect
in regards to debunk.
You're not real news,
you're fake news.
Sir, everything you've said
has been debunked,
why are you continuing
to put this out there?
So he's basically just
copying Trump.
And if there is one thing
worse than something terrible,
it's a cover band
of that terrible thing.
If Trump is Nickelback,
that man is Bickleknack.
Not as good at it
as the original,
and a horrible sign
that the disease is spreading.
The problem is
if that becomes
the level of discourse
in this country,
we are seriously
and lastingly fucked.
And just this week,
we saw some of these techniques
pushed to the absolute limit
by the scandal involving
Alabama Senate candidate
Roy Moore,
who has denied allegations
of sexual misconduct
with a 14-year-old
when he was 32
and called them "fake news."
Now, watch Sean Hannity
then use whataboutism
to derail
a discussion about it.
This 14-year old girl,
purportedly,
according to
 The Washington Post,
told two of her girlfriends
-what happened in real time.
-SEAN HANNITY: Here's
a tough question...
Do you think Bill Clinton,
in retrospect, was a predator?
But, that is not what this
discussion is about.
You might as well have said,
"Here's a tough question,
'If you had to guess,
how many lobsters are there?'"
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-"Like total? In the world?"
Is that worth discussing?
Sure, but first let's finish
talking about
the Senate candidate
who may have made sexual
advances on a child.
And, look, whether Clinton
engaged in predatory behavior
is absolutely a legitimate
question, but
it shouldn't really inform
what we do about Roy Moore.
And, even if you believe
the Democrats are guilty
of a double standard,
the solution is not to have
no standard whatsoever.
That is why it's so important
to train ourselves to identify
these techniques because their
natural endpoint
is the erosion of our ability
to decide what's important,
have an honest debate, and hold
one another accountable.
And that erosion
could be so gradual
that it's difficult to spot.
It's like being murdered
by a sloth.
It happens very slowly
and you might not notice
-until it's too late.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
Now, listen, this is all
very bleak.
I cannot pretend that it isn't,
which is why it is so important
to take some hope
from this year's small victories
like the Muslim ban
being blocked by the courts
after massive public protests.
-(AUDIENCE CHEERS AND APPLAUDS)
-Or, or, the attempts...
to appeal Obamacare stalling,
thanks in part to people
pressuring their lawmakers.
And, just this week,
just this week in Virginia,
voters rejected Ed Gillespie
for governor
after he ran a Trump-style,
dog-whistle campaign.
And that is encouraging
because it's nice to know that
if you use Trump tactics
in a Virginia gubernatorial
election,
you do not get
to be "gubernator."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-Now...
further down the ballot there,
Tuesday also marked the defeat
of Bob Marshall,
who earlier this year proposed
a so-called bathroom bill.
He lost to Danica Roem,
who will now be Virginia's
first openly transgender
legislator.
And the tone that she has taken
is already markedly different.
Danica, you were running
against, um, Robert Marshall,
an incumbent,
thirteen-term incumbent.
He's also a man who referred
to himself
as "Virginia's chief homophobe."
 He refused to debate you
 during the campaign.
Do you have anything
you wanna say to him?
Come January, delegate Marshall
will be one of my constituents
and I'm not gonna disrespect
my own constituents.
Wow, that is incredibly
refreshing.
Just think about that.
She beat a man who openly
disrespected her,
but given the opportunity,
she chose not to respond
by tweeting...
(READS TWEET)
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
It's nice! It's nice not
to have that.
And, look, Tuesday's results
should not make you complacent.
They are absolutely no
guarantee that the midterms
will turn out at all well.
That is why, though,
you should take these moments
of encouragement
to help you keep going.
Because the Trump Presidency
is basically a marathon.
It's painful, it's pointless,
and the majority of you
didn't even agree to run it.
You were just signed up by
your dumbest friend.
And-- And the fact is
we are not even at mile six
right now,
or possibly even mile three.
So, there is a long way to go,
and though you're exhausted
and your whole body
is screaming for you to give up,
and your nipples are chafing
for some reason,
the stakes are too high
for any of us to stop.
And, I do realize that
I'm saying that
as we're about to stop doing
shows for the year.
But-- But here's the thing,
we won't actually
be going away entirely.
You might remember
earlier this year,
we used our "Catheter Cowboy"
to try and get information
to the president in the
ad breaks of Fox & Friends.
Well, Trump is still watching
that show and we know this
because The Times wrote
a generally negative piece
about its enormous
influence on him.
And because of that called it
"...the most powerful TV show
in America."
A sentiment that the hosts
were very excited about.
This program,
the program you're watching,
is, according to
 The New York Times,
"...the most powerful TV show
in America."
-TUCKER CARLSON: Wow!
-AINSLEY EARHARDT:
Do you know why Steve?
Because we have
the best viewers.
Yes.
-No.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Floods. They are clearly
catastrophic, traumatic events,
although they have also
been responsible
for one of the most
memorable clips
in the history
of broadcast news.
Good morning.
Well, obviously we're getting
a nice break from the rain,
but not the flooding.
-This is essentially now...
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
...a part of the Passaic River
in this neighborhood.
That's it.
Fuck James Cameron
and fuck Titanic,
because that is now officially
the greatest boat disaster
ever captured on film.
It's over.
Now, floods were
everywhere this summer.
Think of them as the "Despacito"
of natural disasters.
Persistent, ubiquitous,
and absolutely no fault
of the Puerto Rican government.
And floods are
always threatening.
Ninety percent of all
natural disasters in the U.S.
involve a flood.
Which is, I assume,
the reason that FEMA's website
once referred to flooding as
"America's number-one
natural hazard,
exclamation mark."
Which is a pretty weird
tone to take
when describing
something horrible.
It's like saying, "Boils:
America's number-one
staph infection!"
Or "Parks: America's number-one
place to die unnoticed!"
And floods are only going
to get worse
due to climate change.
And I know that there are people
who will dispute that,
and we just don't
have time tonight
to litigate whether
extreme-weather events
are exacerbated
by climate change.
So for now, let's just say...
(DRAMATIC MALE VOICE OVER)
-Yeah.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
They just definitely are.
I mean...
-Sure, sure...
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
...it is-- It is
a complicated issue,
and we may not have
definitive proof
until the late 1980s.
But-- But, while floods
are often referred to
as "natural disasters,"
the truth is the damage they do
is often to some extent
within our control.
Because we have made
certain decisions
that put and keep
people and property
in the path of flooding.
And that is what
this story is about.
And before we go any further,
let's acknowledge
that people live near water
for all sorts of reasons.
For some, it's where
their families have lived
for generations, or a necessity
for the work that they do.
And for others, it's a luxury.
And living next to the water
is undoubtedly attractive,
despite the risks,
like flooding,
or stepping on pointy seashells,
or mistakenly giving
a Tostito to a seagull
without realizing that
that means
you will now spend
the rest of your life haunted
by a Tostito-addicted seagull.
The point is,
whatever the reason
-to live by the water...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-(SEAGULL SQUAWKING)
-many do-- Oh, for fuck's sake!
You've got to be kidding!
I don't have any Tostitos!
I've been telling you that
for six years!
Look, no Tostitos!
No Tostitos! Get out of here.
Get out of here,
you flying beach rat.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)
-Sorry.
The point is,
the dangers
of waterfront living are real.
But many people, like this man,
who lives on the water
in Tampa Bay,
feel the benefits outweigh
the risks.
REPORTER: Mark knows
 that life here is tenuous.
 But he doesn't dwell on it.
Every morning when I walk out
to get the paper,
I see dolphins frolicking
in the bayou,
and Roseate spoonbills
 walking around the edge
 of the bayou, so...
 it tends to make you forget
about all those sorts of things.
Sure, I can imagine
that seeing a Roseate spoonbill
would take your mind off things,
because you're spending
your whole day
trying to figure out
how a flamingo
could have gotten its
stupid bird face
stuck into a panini press.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-I'm just saying,
even people who like birds
don't like this bird.
The Audubon society,
an organization
whose entire purpose
is to champion birds,
says they are, quote,
"Gorgeous at a distance
and bizarre up close."
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Which is like the
American Kennel Club saying,
"We celebrate all dogs and honor
them as man's best friend,
but the Dandy Dinmont
has a trash personality,
and looks like a scotty
fucked Phil Spector.
And look, look...
If you are literally overlooking
a bayou like that guy
you are probably aware
that flooding is a risk.
But not every flood-prone area
is directly along the coast,
and sometimes aggressive
development
can exacerbate
the risk of flooding,
even considerably inland.
Just look at Houston,
which was recently rocked
by Harvey.
REPORTER 2: The metro area's
 development has exploded.
One study found the Houston area
 has added 25 percent
 more pavement over 15 years,
 replacing soil-rich wetlands
 that could absorb water
with concrete-covered suburbia.
Exactly, and that made Harvey's
damage significantly worse.
Concrete isn't good
at absorbing water.
That is why people don't
dry off at the beach
by rolling around
in the parking lot.
But it's not just global warming
or unchecked growth
that have put more people
in risky, flood-prone areas.
It's also the fact that
it's frequently only possible
for people to take that risk
because they have
flood insurance.
Just look at Buying the Beach.
It's a House Hunters type show
for people who want to live
near the water. And one episode
featured two brothers
named Mitch and Daniel
 arguing over a particular
 beach house
 which led to this exchange...
What do you think
about the island house, Mitch?
MITCH:
 Well, I think there was a lot
of good and a lot of bad on it.
 Right off those steps into
 the beach, can't be beat.
DANIEL: We are really close
 to the water.
 That's just another thing
 that's got me concerned.
Well, that's what
insurance is for.
"That's what insurance is for."
That may be
the most reckless statement
ever said on a boat.
And I'm very much including,
"I can definitely
make this shot work."
And, "Hey! Let's feed
these gulls some Tostitos."
-(SEAGULL SQUAWKING)
-I don't have any!
All I did was said the word.
Get out of here!
No Tostitos! No Tostitos!
But Mitch-- No Tostitos!
But-- But Mitch...
Mitch isn't wrong.
That if they bought that house,
they could get flood insurance
and surprisingly cheaply.
And it's worth taking some time
to understand why
that is the case, because
unlike other forms
of homeowner's insurance,
flood protection is actually
underwritten by the government,
through the NFIP,
or National
Flood Insurance Program.
It started nearly 50 years ago,
after historic floods
wiped out many people's
homes in the 1960s,
and the government
back then realized
that there was
a real problem.
Insurance companies
wouldn't cover floods
at an affordable cost,
because it was too risky,
so because of that,
the government was spending
way too much
on disaster relief,
so they stepped in,
and created the NFIP,
which offered significantly
discounted insurance
to encourage people to buy it,
and that sounds great,
but crucially, the aim
at the time was not
that people would be staying
in at-risk homes permanently,
as the program's current
administrator explains.
They presumed
that if we told
people they were at risk,
they would move.
They presumed that
over the life of the program,
those discounts wouldn't need
to be continued,
and they presumed they wouldn't
need to be continued because
once people knew
they had the risk,
they would move out.
That has not proven true.
No, but of course it hasn't,
because that's not how
-people work.
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
We will gladly accept huge risks
to our personal safety
for the sake of a discount,
that was the entire premise
behind the McDonald's
dollar menu.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
A-- and that is just one
of the many flaws
with how this well-intentioned
program was designed,
because everything about it
from who participates
to where the money goes,
to the incentives it creates,
needs fixing.
And let's start with the fact
that eligibility for the program
is determined
through flood plain maps.
You are required
to buy flood insurance
if you have
a federally-backed mortgage
and FEMA's maps show
that you live in a risky area.
Unfortunately, the mandate
has been poorly enforced,
meaning that lots of people
don't buy insurance who should.
And the maps themselves
can be both out of date
and wildly inaccurate.
In fact,
just days before Harvey struck,
a study of Houston
area flood maps
was published and
the results were alarming.
REPORTER 3:
 Over the course of a decade,
 researchers at Rice University
 and Texas A&M Galveston
 studied one section
 of southeast Harris County.
 They found FEMA's
 flood plain maps
 missed about 75 percent
of the damages from the storms--
Seventy-five percent.
At that point, you might as well
predict floods by having
blindfolded six-year-olds
pin little cardboard puddles
onto city maps
at birthday parties.
But even if all the maps
were perfect,
there would be another flaw
with the NFIP,
which is how it's administered.
You see, typically
the government
doesn't directly insure you.
Instead, it pays
private insurance companies
a fee for every policy
they sell.
But not just that.
The federal government
is then responsible
for covering any losses,
which is a pretty
fucking sweet deal
for those companies.
They take none of the risk,
and yet they get
all the rewards, but it gets
even worse,
because they also get paid
for each claim they handle.
And when Frontline
crunched some of the numbers,
and presented them
to a former head of the program,
they found something shocking.
REPORTER 4: There was one
 number that really jumped out.
 With all the claims
 in the wake of Sandy,
 the profits were more than
 $400 million.
Because they're handling
a lot of claims that year
and they get-- make a lot of
money when they handle claims.
When a big storm hits then,
they make more money.
Yeah, at the very time
you need them to make less money
if anything, because-- because
of-- the burden
is gonna be borne
by the taxpayers,
they make a killing.
That's true.
For insurance companies,
the bigger the disaster,
the more they stand to profit.
And that is a business model
not usually seen
outside
of Nicholas Cage's career.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
(STAMMERS) And while
the insurance industry
may dispute exactly
how much profit they make,
the fact remains that
the government and the taxpayer
are definitely the ones
eating the losses,
which is one of the reasons why
even before
these latest hurricanes,
the program was
$25 billion in debt,
and there are not enough
Roseate spoonbills in the world
to take your mind off that,
and just to be clear,
there are exactly enough
Roseate spoonbills in the world.
I-- I'm just saying,
do we all really need
more of this?
(BIRDS WHINE)
"Hey kids, come see!
The dirty pink dinosaur
is noisily devouring its young!"
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And look,
there is a good argument to make
that helping people stay
in their homes after a disaster
is what government is for.
But remember, a big chunk
of that money
is just going
to the insurance companies
and another shockingly big chunk
of that money
goes to very few homes.
For instance,
along the Gulf Coast
in Florida, just one percent
of properties covered
by the NFIP have accounted
for a quarter of flood claims.
These are called... (STAMMERS)
...so-called
"Repetitive-loss properties."
Now, they are homes
that can flood over and over
and over again, getting payments
each and every time.
And some of them
are costing us a fortune.
REPORTER 5: Just recently, an
 article in The Washington Post
 highlighted a home
 in Pointe Coupee Parish
 that has flooded 40 times.
 While the house is valued
 at just $56,000,
 the NFIP has doled out
 nearly $430,000
 to cover flood claims.
-So, that is just stupid.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Because if nothing else,
if your house floods 40 times,
Mother Nature is sending you
a pretty clear message,
and that message is,
"Hey, would you mind leaving?
Some weird fish
would like to fuck in here now."
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And some parts of the country
have particularly
extreme examples of this.
Now, you remember
Mitch and Daniel?
The pastel deathtrap
that they were looking at
is on a place
called Dauphin Island,
where over the past two decades,
homeowners have paid
just $9.3 million in premiums
into the NFIP,
but they've received
$72.2 million in payments
for their damaged homes.
It is so bad that the island
got written up by Bloomberg
under the headline,
"Love of Coastal Living
is Draining
U.S. Disaster Funds."
And at first glance,
we thought, "Hold on.
Isn't that
the exact same eyesore
on stilts that Mitch
and Daniel almost bought?"
Well, the good news is,
it's actually not.
The bad news is,
it's literally the house
next door
and it was also featured
on a different episode
of Buying the Beach.
WOMAN: It's right
 in the water.
 It wasn't close to the beach,
 it was in the ocean.
The waves are just...
right here.
(EXHALES) It's literally
in the ocean.
 This is insane.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Yeah, it is insane,
but what's even crazier is
at the end of the episode,
-they decided to buy the house!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But even if you were able
to overlook
the repetitive loss properties,
which you shouldn't,
there is another issue,
and that is that nearly one
out of every five homes
covered under the NFIP
is a second home.
And because the program
isn't means tested,
the benefits frequently go
to some wealthy individual's
vacation homes.
One such property belonged
to John Stossel,
a Fox News personality,
and partially hydrogenated
Tom Selleck.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And-- and I'll let Stossel,
who really answers the question
"What if Freddie Mercury had
quit singing to become
an assistant floor manager
-at Men's Warehouse?" I'll--
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
I'll let him tell you
all about it,
'cause even he knew
it was ridiculous.
JOHN STOSSEL: Years ago,
 I built this beach house.
 That's younger me, there.
 The house was on the edge
 of the Atlantic Ocean,
 a risky place to build,
 but I built anyway.
 'Cause a federal program
 guaranteed my investment.
 Eventually, a storm swept away
 my first floor,
 but I didn't lose a penny.
 Thanks. I never invited
 you there,
 but you paid
 for my new first floor.
Okay, so now Stossel is clearly
just baiting people,
because under
no circumstances does
anyone want to be funding
the reconstruction
of the world's smuggest man's
rickety sea prison.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And there is lots
to be confused about there,
not-- not least of which,
that photo of Stossel
posing shirtless
in skin-tight white swim trunks
from hundreds of feet away.
-Who took that photo?
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
It can't be another human
who wanted it.
So, here's my guess.
I think that he put a camera
on a long delay timer,
then sprinted
for a full 45 seconds
back to the deck of his house,
whispering
"hurry, hurry, hurry!"
to himself the entire time,
and got in position
just in time for that photo
to happen.
That is the only scientifically
possible explanation.
We debated this
the entire fucking week
and it's the only scenario
that we could all agree on.
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
-And look-- look.
Here's the-- here's the thing.
If... If you choose to build
something in a risky place
like John Stossel's
salt-battered,
-bottom's-only beach mistake,
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
you should absolutely
be allowed to do that,
but you shouldn't expect
the government
to repeatedly help you rebuild
when things inevitably go wrong.
However, the vast majority,
the vast majority here
of NFIP beneficiaries
are not wealthy,
or second homeowners.
They often really need this
program and cannot afford
for it to go under.
And, for those stuck in
repetitive loss properties,
it is easy for anyone to just
say, "They should move,
they should just move."
But, it's much more
difficult than that
as this Kentucky woman,
whose home has flooded
repeatedly, will tell you.
We couldn't sell our house.
Who would want to buy a house
that's had this many
repetitive floods in it?
Who would want to buy a house?
We have neighbors that have had
their houses up for sale
for two and three years
and haven't even had anyone
come and view the house.
We need a buy out from FEMA
or from whoever it is that
is responsible for this.
Right, and her decision to try
and leave that home
could not have
been easy because
you don't want to throw out
the baby with the floodwater.
But, at a certain point,
the responsible thing to do
is to get a better,
more water-resistant baby.
Which is, incidentally,
also the title of Britain's
best-selling book on teaching
children to swim.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Now, unfortunately, our buy-out
programs are hugely
underfunded
and prohibitively slow.
It can take years for buy-outs
to get approved,
by which point, homeowner's have
probably had to
rebuild their house at the
government's expense
and it may have
already flooded again.
So, essentially,
a government program
that was supposed to help people
in flooded homes
is sometimes trapping them
inside them indefinitely.
And trapping people in
structurally-unsound homes
isn't what
the government is for,
it's what buying
the beach is for.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
No, there just has to be
a better way here,
and there are some key
things that we can do
to improve this program.
We can do things like
means-test it
and eventually get rid
of discounts for second homes
and gradually increase
the insurance rates
on some properties so that they
reflect actual risk.
Unfortunately, the last time
that Congress tried
a major reform of the NFIP
with the Biggert-Waters Act
of 2012,
the result was that many
people's rates skyrocketed
overnight and politicians were
so spooked by angry constituents
they significantly scaled back
many of the reforms.
And, I'm not saying that this
will ever be politically easy.
Because even if you do properly
fund and streamline
a buy-out scheme, there are
still going to be cases
where people just want
to stay put.
Right here in New York,
there is a low-line community
called "Broad Channel,"
where the streets can flood
twice a month.
Its residents fought against
those rate increases
a few years ago and many of them
have no interest in leaving.
No, the neighborhood's
too great then.
Listen, my whole house got
destroyed by Sandy and I--
you know,
I redid my whole house.
I-- You know, people were like,
"You're crazy, you should move."
I said, "Absolutely not."
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But, you're standing
in water right now.
Maybe the people telling
you to move were saying,
"At the very least, can you move
up five inches to dry land?"
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But the hard truth here is
even expensive interventions
are likely to only buy that
community a little more time
and people in Broad Channel
will eventually be leaving,
whether it's by moving truck
or by boat
because environmental conditions
are going to get worse.
Heavy downpours have increased
in the last 50 years
and sea levels have been
climbing steadily
and I'm not saying that that is
because of climate change
even though...
(DRAMATIC MALE VOICE OVER)
It just is. It just--
It just is. Precisely.
The NFIP is actually due for
re-authorization this December
and I would argue that it is
time to take another shot at
serious thoughtful reform
because without it
we have an unstable,
unsustainable program
that is indirectly harming
some of the people
that it was designed
to help and...
(STAMMERING) I do-- I don't
have any--
-I've told you the last time--
-John, John, John! Relax!
I'm not here for Tostitos.
-Really?
-Yeah.
Hold on. You-- You--
You can talk?
Of course. Seagulls can talk.
We just choose to listen
most of the time.
-♪ (PIANO PLAYS SOFTLY) ♪
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Oh, well, that's--
That's actually very nice.
And, I heard what you were
saying about flooding
-and you are right.
-Mm-hmm.
I've seen it. I'm a seagull.
-Yeah.
-Some people in high-risk areas
will need to move
and we should give 'em the help
that they can do that with.
-Right. Okay.
-Because...
While leavin' your home is hard,
being forced out when it's
uninhabitable is
ten times harder.
-Right.
-And, after all,
your home isn't just
walls and a roof,
it's where the people
you love are.
Aw! Seagull, I gotta say that
was absolutely beautiful.
Yeah, not bad
for a "flying beach rat."
-Aw, no, no, no, no, no, don't--
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Don't talk like that about
yourself. No, don't, don't.
It's okay. I know it's true.
You know it's true.
Everybody watchin'
knows it's true.
Hey, I eat French fries
out of the garbage.
Yeah, you're right.
You make a good point.
You're absolutely disgusting.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-But-- But you know what?
I am truly sorry for misjudging
your motives in coming here.
That's okay, Johnny.
Uh, just one more thing...
Sure. Anything.
You have any Tostitos?
Fuck you!
No! I do not have any Tostitos!
They're all gone.
Get the fuck outta here.
 -Get outta here!
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING, APPLAUDING)
Equifax.
The company whose name sounds
like a theatrical production
in which Daniel Radcliffe,
plays a horse
-that fucks a fax machine.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Now Equifax,
is one of the big three
credit reporting agencies.
The companies who keep
financial data on all of us.
So that people like uh, lenders
and landlords can decide,
whether or not
we are trustworthy.
So, Equifax controls some of our
most sensitive information
and about a month ago,
we learned this.
NEWSCASTER 1:
 Breaking news from the
 credit monitoring company,
 Equifax.
 Cyber thieves making off
 with private information
 of 143 million Americans,
nearly half the U.S. Population.
It's actually worse.
It's now 145 million Americans
and I have got good news
and bad news there.
The good news is that
by "private information"
they don't mean
your Google search history, so,
nobody yet knows about the time
you searched for,
"wario porn (real),"
or "world's richest dogs
looking for assistants,"
or "can loneliness
cause the farts?"
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But the bad news is,
the information they got,
could well be all this.
NEWSCASTER 2: It's your name,
 social security number,
 birth date, driver's license
 and addresses where you lived,
 information that
 is mostly permanent
 unless you're in
 federal witness protection.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Wow! Okay,
so, that does sound bad,
but here's a simple solution,
just move 145 million people
into the witness
protection program.
That means Jones'
uh, you are the Thompson's,
uh, Thompson's
you're the Campbell's,
Campbell's
you're the Mendoza's,
Mendoza's, you're the Jones'.
Wait-- wait hold on,
Jones' you shouldn't be there,
I made you the Thompson's.
No, Thompson's I made you
the Campbell's.
Campbell's,
you're the Mendoza's.
Mendoza's, why are you there?
You should be living
in the Jones' house in Phoenix.
Oh no, I shouldn't have
said Phoenix.
-Oh God, the Jones' are dead!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-The Jones' are dead!
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
Forget the whole plan,
I was just trying to help!
I'm sorry for trying!
Oh, they're dead!
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
-And-- and I know--
-I know there might be...
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
...some younger people
watching this
and, well hold on-- who cares?
We're the first generation
to routinely send pictures
of our junk to each other
-over the internet.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Why should we give a shit
about someone seeing
our social security numbers?
But you should know,
criminals can do a lot more
with that number
than they can with a picture
of your dick.
This information
is gonna be sold
left and right
on the black market.
People are gonna be
able to open up credit cards
for the rest of your life
once they have that information.
They can go out and purchase
a home in your name.
They can open bank accounts,
take car loans.
Someone who has your
social security number
could actually take a job,
they could file taxes
and even claim
your kids as dependents
and be gone with your refund
before you ever actually file
a tax return.
No! No!
No, the tax benefit,
is the whole point
of having children.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Without that,
all you're left with
is your actual children.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Which, you know...
-Ugh!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
The point here is,
it's a huge problem
and in any other era,
this would've been
the biggest news story
for a month, but--
but now that
every day's headline
is simply the words,
"Everything batshit
bananas again today,"
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-it slipped under the radar,
but it is worth asking,
"How the hell did this happen?"
Because the short answer is,
the people in-charge have done
literally everything wrong.
And let's start with just--
just the way that Equifax
told us about the hack.
In early September,
their then CEO, Rick Smith,
a man with a face and name
so bland
he may as well be called,
"Human Person,"
or "Frasier re-run."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-He issued a taped apology,
but his remorse seemed a little
less than heart felt.
On July 29th of this year,
we discovered that attackers
had gained unauthorized access
to certain Equifax data files.
This is clearly
a disappointing event
and one that strikes
at the heart...
of who we are
and what we do.
-Holy shit!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Rick Smith is so
alarmingly mechanical
you probably have to put him
in rice every time he gets wet.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Now, notably
he mentioned there that Equifax
learned about the breach
on July 29th,
but even more notably that video
was uploaded in September,
which is, and this is true,
after July.
So, Equifax
knew about the breach
for nearly six weeks
before telling the public
and they claim
that they needed that time
because the investigation was
"complex and time consuming."
Although, that's not all
that happened in that time span.
NEWSCASTER 3: Three Equifax
 executives
sold nearly two million dollars
 in company stock,
 days after the data breach
 was discovered.
Wow!
Selling stock before the public
knows there's a problem
is one of those thing
that looks suspicious
whether or not you're
actually doing something wrong.
It's like, walking
into a petting zoo,
with a bib on.
What exactly are you planning
-on messily devouring in there?
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And Equifax defended
that saying,
none of the executives
in question
including their
Chief Financial Officer
knew about the data breach,
which raises another question,
-"How is that even possible?"
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Did they just ignore emails
with the subject lines,
"Breach!"
"Following up on breach!"
"Where the fuck are you?
Breach, breach, breach!"
And, "Just spoke to you
in person about breach
and you just stared blankly
at me, and then said,
'I'm gonna order
from the salad place.'"
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And if you are getting
frustrated already
with this kind of incompetence,
you're gonna need
to pace yourself,
because this story,
gets a lot worse.
Apparently,
there were multiple points
where this hack
could have been prevented
and one of them is incredible,
because Equifax were alerted
by Homeland security,
back in March,
that they needed to fix
a critical vulnerability
in their software.
But as lawmakers discovered
at a recent hearing,
that's not what happened.
There was one person apparently,
who forgot to tell somebody
that they had a piece
of software
that needed to be patched.
Yeah, it is not ideal,
that a company guarding
such valuable information
leaves something that important
down to one person.
It's like finding out
that Chase Bank
has a big red button labeled,
"Lose everyone's money,
and the only thing
stopping anyone from pushing it,
-is Frank."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And look, I love Frank.
I love the guy,
but what if he has to pee?
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
A-- and I want to tell you
that this is an anomaly,
but Equifax has had multiple
headline-grabbing breaches
over the years,
and that is not even counting
smaller incidents like this.
I checked my credit report
the other day
online with Equifax...
That was it, and next thing
I know I have 300 pieces of mail
sittin' in my mailbox.
NEWSCASTER 4: Every single one
 of these is addressed to her,
 but they're not hers.
 Instead, she got
 other people's credit reports.
 Now, names,
 social security numbers,
 dates of birth, current
 and previous addresses
 bank and loan account numbers,
 all stacked up
on a kitchen table in Biddeford.
-(AUDIENCE GROANING)
-Yeah, I mean,
that not great, is it?
And it really should have
set off red flags at Equifax,
when hundreds of different
credit reports
were being mailed
to the same address.
What exactly did you think
had happened there
that every single Fraggle
checks their credit at once,
down at Fraggle Rock?
-Down at Fraggle Rock?
-(AUDIENCE CLAPPING)
-Now-- very nice.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And--
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And I know that other companies
have had breaches
but none remotely as damaging
as this new Equifax one,
'cause remember,
this isn't Target
exposing
customer's credit cards.
This is compromising
social security numbers
the things that thieves
could use
to open new credit cards
in your name
and if your information
was stolen, which remember,
is about a 50-50 chance,
it could haunt you forever.
You don't change
your birth date,
you don't change your
social security number.
Those who've been, uh,
jeopardized by this hack
will have to protect themselves
 for years, until they're dead.
It's true and just
think about that.
There is only one other thing
that you have to
constantly protect yourself from
until you're dead.
-And that's fucking death!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And you would hope that Equifax
would do a decent job
of mitigating the damage.
After all,
they did have nearly six weeks
to work on a response,
but instead,
their fuck ups continued.
For instance, they created
a website
for concerned consumers
to go to,
but then this happened:
The site that Equifax started
is called Equifax Security 2017.
 But a developer named
 Nick Sweeting,
 wanted to show,
 how easy it is
 to create a similar fake site,
 so he did.
 He called it,
 Security Equifax 2017.
(AUDIENCE GROANING)
Exactly, someone created
a fake site
and if you're thinking,
"Well, who would be dumb enough
to fall for that?"
Equifax! That's who!
Because they tweeted links
to that fake site
at least eight times!
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING
IN DISBELIEF)
Despite the fact that site had
a couple of tiny clues
that it might be fake
from the headline reading,
"Why did Equifax use a domain
that's so easily impersonated
by phishing sites?"
to the fact that when you
clicked on their
Frequently Asked Questions,
this happened.
♪ ("NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP"
BY RICK ASTLEY PLAYING) ♪
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING
AND CHEERING)
Well played pranksters,
you have my respect.
But look, don't worry.
Equifax says that they are
tightening up their operation.
And to see how well
that they've done on that,
You-- you can just go to,
equifaxfraudprevention.com,
not because it's their site
but because it's our site.
We bought it two days ago,
and if you'll go there
you'll find the message,
"How were we still able
to do this?
Why haven't you learned
anything?"
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But wait-- wait!
Because there is even more.
'Cause Equifax
also offered consumers
a year of free credit monitoring
but when people tried to sign-up
for the service,
they noted something.
Guess what? You lock into
Equifax terms of service
-when sign-up for it,
-Ah!
which means that you
can't sue the company.
You've gotta resolve any
disputes in forced arbitration.
Exactly! You'll be giving up
your right to sue.
So legally, your best recourse
at that point would be,
shaking your fist at the heavens
while shouting, "Equifax!"
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Now, they-- they've since
rescinded that clause,
although many frustrated people
are now signing up
for third party credit
monitoring services like,
LifeLock, who've been
advertising everywhere.
And they've seen a real surge
in business
in the wake
of this breach, although,
if you're considering LifeLock
because you are mad at Equifax,
there is something
you're gonna need to know.
According to filings
with the SCC,
LifeLock purchases
credit monitoring services from
-Equifax.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)
And that means someone buys
credit monitoring
through LifeLock.
LifeLock turns around
and passes some of that revenue
directly along to Equifax.
Is that right Mr. Smith?
That is correct.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING
IN DISBELIEF)
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-It's true. Some of--
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
some of the money that you pay
to LifeLock
goes right back
to fucking Equifax,
which could only be
more infuriating
if you then found out that
the rest of it goes
to Toys For Todds.
A charity that purchases
sex toys
-for grown men named Todd.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Buy your own sex toys Todd,
we can't carry you on this one.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And look, Equifax
connections aside,
LifeLock has had
repeated issues itself,
including settlements
with the FTC
and a truly disastrous
ad campaign
a few years back.
I'm Todd Davis,
and I'm here
to prove just how safe
your identity can be
with LifeLock.
That's my real
social security number.
Yeah, LifeLock's then-CEO
Todd Davis,
actually put his real
social security number,
457-55-5462,
on a truck and billboards.
For a time, it was impossible
to escape
his social security number,
-457-55-5462.
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLING)
And that was a very cocky move
and one that resulted in him
having his identity stolen
-13 times.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
And I'm guessing,
that the defense
for the people who took it was,
"I didn't steal his identity
I literally got it off
the back of a truck."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-So, to put it mildly,
LifeLock, may not be your
best solution
to the Equifax crisis,
which brings us to the question,
"What is?"
Well, consumer advocates told us
that the one big step
everyone should take,
is to go through all three large
credit reporting companies,
that's Equifax, Experian
and TransUnion,
and freeze your credit.
That way no one can access it,
including you,
until you unfreeze it.
Now the companies also offer
their own credit protection
products,
with names like, Trusted ID
or Credit Lock Plus.
But, they are
often more expensive
and offer fewer
consumer protection.
So, if you need a way
to remember this,
locks, are something
you don't want.
Think of Justin Bieber's
dreadlocks.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-A terrible decision
to be avoided!
Whereas freezes are great.
Uh, think of this tiny penguin
losing its frozen mind.
♪ (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) ♪
See! So, to recap,
-locks, oof, freezes, wee!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Now-- now, here is the thing--
here's the thing on this.
Freezing and unfreezing
of your credit can cost money
which will go back to these
companies, because seemingly,
they just can't
fucking lose on this.
And if you need any more
proof of that,
on the very same day
that Congress was yelling at
Equifax's former CEO,
it emerged that the company
had just been awarded
a seven-million-dollar contract
by the IRS, to prevent fraud,
which led one senator to make
a pretty brutal comparison.
You realize, to many Americans
right now, that looks like uh...
we're giving Lindsay "Lohawn"
the keys to the mini bar.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING IN SHOCK,)
APPLAUDING)
I understand your point.
That was the pause of man
thinking, "Do I let that pass?"
"Do I correct him
on how to pronounce Lohan?"
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Or do I double down
and pronounce her name,
"Lingonberry Lahoni Baloney."
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And you should know--
you should know
that IRS deal
has been suspended,
not cancelled by the way,
just suspended.
And that might make you angry
but the problem is,
that anger won't have
much impact on Equifax.
Because they make
most of their money
selling our data to businesses,
like banks.
So, in their eyes,
we are not the consumer,
we're the product.
To think of it in terms of KFC.
We are not the guy buying
the ten-piece buckets,
-we're the fucking chickens!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
So, for the time being,
businesses are the only ones
who can exert influence here
and as one colorfully dressed
expert pointed out,
that's not gonna happen
anytime soon.
I haven't heard any big company
came out-- come out yet
and say, "We're not gonna use
Equifax anymore"
-for their credit scores.
-STUART VARNEY: Good point.
So far, everybody's been quiet,
and I don't know what they're
waiting to hear.
This is outrageous,
they should be done
but I bet you,
because it's America,
they'll be okay.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Here's the truth,
that angry business casual
farm animal on Fox Business
-is talking sense.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And that sentence alone
shows just how bad things are.
So, in the long term,
there should clearly be
major reform to this industry
and how it's regulated,
but that is going to take time,
so until then
you need to freeze
your credit reports
with all three
of these companies,
and only unfreeze them
when you need to apply
for credit.
And because the freeze option
can be hard to find
on their sites
if you go to our twitter feed,
we will give you exact links
to do that, and when you do,
they will give you a PIN number
that you need to unfreeze it.
So, do not lose that number,
or at the very least,
make it something memorable.
I don't know, like...
-457-55-5462.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
-But not that, 'cause of course
that's Todd Davis's
social security number.
Before our main story tonight,
I'd like to do something
a little different
and just quickly tell you
about a beloved icon
of my childhood,
and it's this man...
WOMAN: For 20 years he made
 the dreams of young people
 come true,
 with his hugely popular
Jim'll Fix It program.
 Best known for his
 trademark jewelry,
 track suits, tinted glasses,
 and Havana cigar.
Now, I know it's
hard to believe,
but that bizarre looking man,
Jimmy Savile,
was a national hero.
We named places for him,
we gave him a knighthood,
we even put up
this statue of him,
even though it clearly looks
more like
a cheese sculpture
of George Carlin
-that someone left in the sun.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Now, he had a show called
 Jim'll Fix It,
where he basically
granted wishes.
And like many British kids,
I actually wrote to him.
I asked him
to make me the mascot
for Liverpool football club,
and he never wrote back.
Which I'm actually glad about,
because after he died,
Britain began to find out
who he really was.
And the truth was horrific.
He's gone from a much loved
entertainer,
and respected charity
fundraiser,
to a man described by
Scotland Yard
as a predatory sex offender.
 Jimmy Savile's headstone
 was here
 for less than three weeks.
 His epitaph read,
 "It was good while it lasted."
Oh!
That is an unsettling thing
to have written
on his gravestone.
Although to be fair,
nearly every famous epitaph
would sound horrifying written
on a sex offender's gravestone.
From Dean Martin's "Everybody
loves somebody sometime,"
to Rodney Dangerfield's
"There goes the neighborhood."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-You know, funny, funny.
But if he'd been
a sex offender,
not so much.
The point is, Savile's
headstone was taken down,
as was that sign,
and that creepy statue,
because once we found out
that he was a monster,
we accepted it was
no longer appropriate
to publicly glorify him.
Which actually brings us
to our main story tonight...
the Confederacy.
America's tracksuit
sex offender.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Now, in recent years,
there has been a robust debate
over Confederate symbols.
From flags being taken down,
to statues being removed,
to the white nationalist
rallies in Charlottesville.
Both the one that
ended in violence in August,
and another that happened
just last night.
So as this debate is clearly
not going away,
we wanted to take a look
at some of the arguments.
Because you don't
have to look hard
to find people very upset
at the idea of Confederate
statues being taken away.
You can't change history.
You can't pick and choose
what you decide is history.
I think they oughta
just leave 'em alone
and leave 'em
where they are, you know.
They're part of history.
I just don't think
we can erase our history.
It may not represent
the best idea...
that anybody ever came up with.
But nevertheless,
it's part of our history.
And, uh,
I think it should stay there.
You know what,
I'll give him this, he is right
that the Confederacy
and everything that came with it
is, to put it mildly,
"not the best idea...
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-anybody ever came up with."
Because that of course
is making grilled cheese
on a toaster turned sideways.
That is a billion-dollar idea
that is also
completely worthless.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-But they're also right
about one thing.
We should
remember our history,
so tonight, let's do that.
And let's look at the unique
heritage of these symbols.
Starting with the fact
that there are a lot more
than you might expect.
REPORTER:
The Southern Poverty Law Center
 found some 1,500 Confederate
 memorials across the country.
 More than 700 of them
 are statues and monuments,
 and ten U.S. military bases
 are named for
 Confederate officers.
Think about that.
There are U.S. military bases
named for Confederate officers.
And they were the enemy.
They killed U.S. soldiers.
That's like finding out that
Nancy Kerrigan
-named her child Tonya Harding.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Why would you do that?
That's a weird choice.
And tributes to the Confederacy
are everywhere in the South,
and notably some
in the North too.
And that map doesn't include
kitschy ways
that the Civil War is presented,
like at this family restaurant:
ANNOUNCER:
 Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede
 brings a rip roaring
 taste of America to life.
 Dixie's Stampede
 is a musical extravaganza
 of sight and sound.
 Centered around a friendly
 North-South rivalry,
 friendly servers bring
the delicious four course feast
 right to you.
 Including a whole
 rotisserie chicken,
 and all the Pepsi, iced tea,
 or coffee you like.
Yes. That is
a Confederate soldier
serving a small child
all the Pepsi she likes.
Which is still remarkably
only Pepsi's second worst
ad campaign.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING
AND CHEERING)
And the thing is if you grew up
with experiences like that,
it can seem like the Civil War
is just a friendly rivalry.
A fun, colorful part
of U.S. history.
But that omits the key fact
about the Civil War.
The Confederacy was fighting for
the preservation of slavery.
And that's not my opinion,
that is just a fact.
There are many ways
that we know this.
Slavery is mentioned in
multiple state's
declarations of secession
with Mississippi saying,
"Our position
is thoroughly identified
with the institution
of slavery."
The Confederate Constitution
contains a clause
enshrining slavery forever.
And then there's the speech
Alexander Stephens,
the Confederate vice president
gave in 1861,
in which he articulated
the basic principles
for the Confederate nation.
ALEXANDER STEPHENS:
 Its foundations are laid.
 Its cornerstone rests upon
 the great truth
 that the Negro is not
 equal to the white man.
 That slavery, subordination
 to the superior race,
 is his natural and
 normal condition.
Wow. Subordination to
the superior race.
That is explicit.
If the Confederacy was not
about slavery,
somebody should really
go back in time
and tell the fucking
Confederacy that.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And yet, remarkably,
many people think the Civil War
was over something else.
REPORTER 2: When people
were asked, "What do they think
 the main cause
 of the Civil War is?"
 48% said,
 "Mainly about states' rights."
 Only 38% said,
 "Mainly about slavery."
 Nine percent said "both."
And that is amazing.
Only 38% thought the Civil War
was mainly about slavery.
In other words,
look to your left,
now look to your right,
statistically all three of you
live in a country
where only 38% percent of people
-think the Civil War
was mainly about slavery.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And on that "states' rights"
argument, for the record,
the Southern states were
ardently pro-states' rights.
But with some
glaring exceptions.
Notably, when Northern states
passed laws to help protect
runaway slaves,
the South wanted
the federal government
to override those states laws.
So, they loved states' rights,
as long as they were
the right states' rights.
The wrong states' rights
would be states' wrongs,
wrongs which would
need to be righted
by the right states' rights--
look, to put it really simply,
they just wanted to
own black people,
-and they didn't much care how.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
That's a fact!
But that's a very hard fact
for some people to accept.
Especially if a member
of your family
fought for the Confederacy.
And sometimes,
the understandable desire
to want to distance
your relative from that cause
can lead to people
distorting the cause itself.
Just watch as one man
at a community meeting
in North Carolina
defended a Confederate statue
by talking about
his family history.
My great grandfather
was a Confederate soldier.
And I was proud of that.
Because my opinion of his fight
was for his rights.
I don't know what
his rights were.
I wasn't there.
He was dead long before
I came along.
But I'm really concerned
about our monument.
I want it to stay.
It reminds me that I got
a little rebel in me.
You know, we all want to
kind of be independent.
We all have a little
rebel in us, even the ladies.
-Ooh! Even the ladies!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Hashtag feminism,
hashtag confedera-she.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, APPLAUDING)
-And look, look.
I don't know, I don't know
why his great grandfather
fought.
It is hard to know
the motivations
of any individual soldier.
What we do know is that
again, collectively,
they were fighting to preserve
the institution of slavery.
And I do get, honestly,
I honestly get
wanting a more comfortable
history for your family.
But in doing so,
you can't invent
a more comfortable history
for your country.
Because you would be erasing
the actual painful experiences
of many Americans.
As a fellow North Carolinian
explains.
When I walk by this statue,
I-- it becomes very painful
when I think of the suffering
that my ancestors went through.
They enslaved people.
Abused people for their own
economic impact.
 And it should not be
 celebrated by these statues.
Right. And that is
the harsh reality
of what was done by
those Confederate men.
And yes, even the ladies,
-hashtag confedera-she.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
If you want to see
a perfect crystallization
of what happens when
two people have
wildly different views
of the same symbol,
just watch this
local news clip.
Why do you carry that flag?
Because this is my heritage.
My family fought
to save their farm
under this flag.
Who was working that farm?
Ooh!
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING IN DISBELIEF)
That is a good, tough question.
And the news clip
actually cut out there,
but we were so intrigued to
find out what his response was
we tracked it down.
And whatever you are expecting,
you're going to be surprised.
-MAN: Who was working that farm?
-My family was!
-Who was working the farm?
-They were poor,
Do you know how much
a slave cost back then?!
-(AUDIENCE SHOUTING)
-Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You know you are in the wrong
when you decide
your best argument
is screaming at a black man,
"Do you know how expensive
you used to be?!"
It is--
It is comments like that one
that landed this guy
on the cover of
 Holy Shit That Is Not
 Remotely The Point magazine.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And look, that-- that is clearly
an intense example.
But denial of this painful
part of history
can take many forms.
Look at PBS's
 Finding Your Roots,
where Henry Louis Gates
explores
celebrities' family histories,
and he often finds some shit.
Famously, Ben Affleck
pulled strings
to get the show
to remove all references
to his slave-owning ancestors.
And though he later apologized,
that impulse right there
is not good.
Because it sanitizes history.
And while there is no
easy way to respond
to learning that kind of
horrible information,
it is worth watching
Anderson Cooper find out
how one relative of his died.
Boykin was murdered by
a rebellious slave.
Wow.
Your ancestor was
beaten to death
with a farm hoe.
(LAUGHS)
Oh my God.
That's amazing.
This is incredible.
(LAUGHS)
I am blown away.
-You think he deserved it?
-ANDERSON COOPER: Yeah.
-Wow. You know what?
-(AUDIENCE CLAPPING)
You know what,
as a general rule,
just try not to live a life
...that could lead a descendant
of yours to one day say,
"A guy smashed
grand-poppy's head in
with a garden hoe?
That's amazing.
Great job 'That Guy!'"
(LAUGHING)
But, my absolute
favorite response
to a nasty surprise,
undoubtedly
comes from Larry David,
who received
a real one-two punch.
Are you telling me that
my great-grandfather
fought for the South?
In the Civil War?
(LAUGHS) What? Are you kidding?
Oh, my goodness...
I hope no slaves show up
on this--
Please turn the page.
(MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER HOLLERS)
Now, Larry, this is
another part of the 18th--
Oh-- oh, you did it!
You did it!
-I knew it! I knew it!
-(GATES LAUGHING)
-Unbelievable!
-Unbelievable.
Boy.
HENRY LOUIS GATES JR:
That's b-- unbelievable.
Oh boy, oh boy.
-Yeah. Prettay, prettay,
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
pretty bad!
Pretty bad!
And look!
Larry David
is not responsible
for what his ancestors did.
None of us are.
I have to believe that,
because I'm English.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And I would like to go
to an Indian restaurant again
at some point in my life.
(LAUGHING CONTINUES)
But-- but we do have to reckon
personally, and as a country
with what our heritage means.
You can't ignore it like Batman,
you can't say
it's something else
like town meeting Santa,
you've got to actively,
painfully,
come to grips with slavery,
and the lasting benefits
and disadvantages
that if conferred.
In ways that, frankly,
we haven't yet.
And that actually brings us back
to Confederate monuments,
because there is
something about them that
that symbolizes our reluctance
to have that conversation
and that is the dates
that they went up.
Because while some
initial memorials
were built mainly in cemeteries,
shortly after the Civil War,
the real surge came
much, much later.
MALE REPORTER 1:
The Southern Poverty Law Center
 says a majority
 of the more than 700
 Confederate monuments
 in public spaces
 across the country,
 were erected decades
 after General Lee's surrender.
It's true, as this chart
of the years that
they were dedicated shows,
there was a big spike
from 1900 to 1920
as white southerners were
re-asserting their dominance
through things like
Jim Crow laws,
uh, with another spike in the
50s and 60s
as the Civil Rights Movement
was gaining steam,
so those statues weren't so much
commemorating
recently fallen dead,
as sending
a pretty hostile message
to African-Americans.
And sending messages is kind of
what statues are often for.
This one says,
"We love freedom."
This one says,
"The most notable thing
about our city
-is a fictional character."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
(STAMMERS) And this one says,
"About yay big."
-(LAUGHING CONTINUES)
-We still don't know...
what he was trying to measure,
but whatever it was,
-it was... "About yay big."
-(LAUGHING CONTINUES)
But... look, for some
Confederate statues though,
for some Confederate statues
the intent is crystal clear.
In that town meeting
from before,
the statue that
they were debating
was this one, which went up
in 1914
and a leader of
that county's chapter of the KKK
gave a speech at its dedication,
calling the occasion
an opportunity
"To recall the achievements
of the great and good
of our own race and blood."
Which, again, is pretty
on-the-nose right there.
And the largest
Confederate memorial,
the carving on Stone Mountain
in Georgia,
is located where the
20th century KKK was born.
It depicts
three Confederate leaders
on horseback, and
it was completed in 1972,
so that means
there is color footage
of the dedication.
After nearly half a century
of work, the memorial carving
here at Stone Mountain
is finally finished.
And officials are calling it
the eighth wonder of the world.
We must recall those principals
of loyalty, dignity and honor
that shine through
the lives of men
we commemorate today.
Yes. That was
Vice President Spiro Agnew
commemorating the loyalty
of literal traitors.
But, what can you really expect
from a man whose name,
rearranged, spells
"Grow a Penis."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And...
and some-- here's the thing.
Some monuments went up
even more recently.
I-- I wanna show you one
that was erected
on private lands,
but very much for
public consumption.
Because once you see it,
you will not forget it.
MALE REPORTER 2:
The statue was erected in 1998.
 It portrays
 Nathan Bedford Forrest
 on his horse.
 Gun in one hand,
 and sword in the other.
 Surrounded by
Confederate state battle flags,
 visible for all to see
 on the side of I-65.
(CARS DRIVING BY)
MALE REPORTER 2: Forrest was
 a Confederate general
-and an early leader of the KKK.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
That is just
objectively terrifying
regardless of context.
He looks like if a nickel
did cocaine.
-(LAUGHING CONTINUES)
-So-- so some of these statues
commemorate people who thought
a war to preserve slavery,
were erected to preserve
white supremacy
and were dedicated by
Klan members and yet,
there is a blanket defense
that tends to get
authored by people
and not just people,
also, this guy.
They're trying to take away...
our culture.
They're trying to take away
our history.
Okay, that argument is
taking these statues down
obliterates history, which is
clearly just ridiculous.
First, monuments are not
how we record history,
books are.
Museums are.
Ken Burns
12-part mini-series are.
Statues are how we
glorify people.
Or, in the case of one in Tokyo,
how we glorify
giant radioactive lizards.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And yet,
the President's concern
seems to be
that tearing down statues
leads to a slippery slope.
This week it's Robert E. Lee.
I noticed that
Stonewall Jackson's
coming down,
I wonder, is it
George Washington next week?
And is it Thomas Jefferson
the week after?
You know, you all--
you really do
have to ask yourself,
"Where does it stop?"
Okay, well,
I'll tell you where it stops.
Somewhere.
Anytime someone asks,
"Where does it stop?"
The answer is always,
"Fucking somewhere!"
You might let your kid
have Twizzlers,
but not inject black-tar heroin.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-You d-- you don't just go,
"Well, after the Twizzlers,
where does it stop?"
-(LAUGHING CONTINUES)
-And the same is true
of Confederate monuments.
Think of it this way,
all people, living and dead,
exist on what I'm gonna call
The Hitler-Hanks spectrum,
from bad to good.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING, CHEERING)
-And at some point
on the spectrum,
monuments to honor people
are going to be inappropriate.
Although it-- to be fair,
it does get tricky
around the middle,
where, of course, you'll fine
Adolf Hankler.
-(LAUGHING CONTINUES)
-And-- and look,
there are clearly people
deserving of statues
who were imperfect humans.
And sometimes our standards
change over time,
which can then get tricky,
because you're judging
historical figures
by modern standards.
But for many
Confederate monuments,
especially those erected
well after the Civil War,
valorizing the cause
or leadership
of the Confederacy,
this really isn't a close call.
This is your babysitter
showing up
in a Jimmy Savile t-shirt.
I don't care what you think
that represents,
you're not staying home
with my fucking kid tonight.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And for Robert E. Lee
in particular,
it's actually even easier
because of this.
MALE REPORTER 1: Interestingly,
 Robert E. Lee was once asked
 about placing memorials
 at Gettysburg in 1869.
 The former general replied,
 "I think it wiser... not to
 keep open the sores of war,
 but to follow the examples
 of those nations
 who endeavored to obliterate
 the marks of civil strife,
 to commit to oblivion
 the feelings engendered."
It's true. Robert E. Lee
was opposed to statues
of people like Robert E. Lee.
So, any city that decides
to keep a statue of him
should at the very least
add a speech bubble saying,
"You know, I told you all
specifically, not to do this."
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
So-- so what do we do now?
Well-- well, I would argue
that nothing is not acceptable,
and-- and trying
to paper over the cracks
can actually make things worse.
In the 1990s, Richmond tried
to fix its Monument Avenue,
a street lined with statues
of Confederate leaders
by adding
African-American tennis legend,
Arthur Ashe to it.
And you can't just
give Confederates a black friend
and say, "We're good, right?"
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-We're good! Arthur's up there!
You love Arthur!
So-- so, if we really want
to learn from,
and honor our history,
perhaps the first step
might be to put
most of these statues
somewhere more appropriate,
surrounded by
ample historical context,
like in a museum.
JOHN OLIVER: Crime.
You know that thing that was
almost solved
-by a flasher dog in 1980's.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But specifically this story
is about
how we increasingly solve crimes
using forensic evidence.
It's that thing that
is just a staple
of TV crime shows.
Pull it from the torso
on the left.
Pull it from
the boat on the right.
Two hearts beat as one.
Matches up perfectly.
-(DISTORTED SOUND)
-That's a match.
-(COMPUTER BEEPS)
-MAN 1: We've got a match.
MAN 2: And it just found
us a match.
WOMAN 1: Visible match.
-WOMAN 2: We've a match.
-Match.
MAN 3: Were you able
to determine
which monkey bit him?
The bite marks match
those of the monkey found
at the scene.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Wow!
That last one was presumably
from one of the crossover
episodes where the team
from Law & Order,
worked a case with the cast
of Monkey Law and Monkey Order.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-(MONKEY SCREECHES)
-But...
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
on TV and in real life
forensic science plays
an important role
in criminal convictions.
Prosecutors often complain
about a so called C.S.I. effect,
where jurors expect to see
forensic evidence in every case.
The problem is,
not all forensic science
is as reliable as we've become
accustomed to believe.
A report in 2009,
by the National Academy
of Sciences found that
many forensic scientists
do not meet the fundamental
requirements of science.
And a report last year
by a Presidential Science
Council agreed saying that,
"expert witnesses have often
overstated
the value of their evidence,
going far beyond
what the relevant science
can justify,"
and that's the thing here.
It's not that
all forensic science is bad,
'cause it's not, but too often,
it's reliability
is dangerously overstated
and one sign of that is that
forensic experts in court
are often nudged to use one
very convincing phrase.
MAN 4: To a reasonable degree
of the scientific certainty...
To a reasonable degree
of scientific certainty...
MAN 5: To a reasonable degree
of the scientific certainty...
Within reasonable
scientific certainty...
To a reasonable degree
of scientific certainty...
MAN 6: Are you able to say that
within a reasonable degree
-of the scientific certainty?
-Yes.
And here's the thing that phrase
does have a persuasive ring
to it. Unfortunately,
as that Presidential Council
pointed out,
it has no generally accepted
meaning in science.
It's one of those terms
like, basic or trill
that has no commonly
understood definition.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Am I trill?
Is that good or bad?
I mean I do feel trill,
so I'm guessing it's awful.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And-- when bad science
is confidently presented,
terrible convictions can happen.
In fact, among the hundreds
of people
who have been exonerated
by DNA testing since 1989,
in nearly half of their cases,
there was some misapplication
of forensic science
and there are people
behind those numbers.
Take Santae Tribble, who was
convicted of murder
and served 26 years.
In large part,
thanks to an FBI analyst
who testified that his hair
matched hairs found
at the scene.
And as he will tell you,
the evidence was presented,
as being rock solid.
They said they matched my hair
in all microscopical
characteristics.
 And that's the way
 they presented it to the jury
and the jury took it for granted
that, that was my hair.
But you know, I can see,
why they did.
Because who other
than an FBI expert
would possibly know
that much about hair?
Except of course,
whoever stalled Amanda Seyfried
at the 2009 Oscars.
Breath taking waves,
without loosing
any of their body or bounce.
-Stunning.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Stunning!
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
-Stunning.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
-Stunning.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
Stunning! Stunning! Stunning!
Stunning! Stunning! Stunning!
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
The jurors in Tribble's case,
were actually told
there was one chance
in ten million
that it could be someone
else's hair, and guess what?
He was exonerated.
Because once DNA analysis became
available, his lawyer tested
the thirteen hairs from the case
and not only were
none of them his,
some of what they found
was incredible.
SANDRA LEVICK: Nine of the
 hairs had come from the
 same source,
a couple had come
from different sources
and one was a dog.
INTERVIEWER: Two different
FBI agents who had, eh,
looked at that and analyzed it,
didn't recognize that it was
-dog hair?
-It was a K9.
It was a domestic dog, yes.
My personal conclusion was,
-the dog committed the crime.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Okay.
So, first, it is amazing that
he is able to laugh at that,
but second, if a dog did
commit the crime
there's really no recourse there
because there is actually no law
against dogs committing murder
and that's a fact
that learned in Air Bud 9,
 Fuck the Paw-lice!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And--
it turns out,
Tribble is not the only case
where FBI experts
overstated their confidence
in their results.
NEWSCASTER:
 The Innocence Project
 and the National Association
 of Criminal Defense lawyers
 found from the 1970's
 through 1999,
 in 268 cases where FBI hair
 analysis led to a conviction,
 257 or 96 percent of them
 had errors in analysis.
-AUDIENCE: Wow.
-Oh, it gets worse
because nine of those defendants
had already been executed,
-(AUDIENCE SWOONING)
-which is horrifying.
And you would expect
FBI hair analysis
to have a high rate of accuracy
than your friend's hair analysis
of you can
totally pull off bangs,
-because you can't,
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
you absolutely can't,
believe me I couldn't,
just learn--
-learn from our mistakes kids.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
Save yourselves!
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
-It's too late for me.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
-And look,
it's by no means,
just microscopic hair
comparison which has had
the reliability
of these results overstated.
Those reports that
I showed earlier suggests
there is weak scientific support
for some aspects
of techniques like
a blood pattern, footwear,
firearm and bite mark analysis.
And you must be familiar
with that last one from
cool scenes like this:
A little 3D magic for clarity
and I give you
the killer's incisors.
(COMPUTER BEEPING)
Oh, Yo!
The computer rated
it "Yellow rectangle."
And we all know yellow rectangle
is the highest level of match
a computer can
give you about teeth.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Look, in the real world,
bite mark analysis
is highly subjective
and unreliable.
The President's Council found
the entire discipline,
does not meet
the scientific standards
for foundational validity.
Which I believe, is science
speak for "Bullshit!"
But people have been sent
to prison
on the basis of bite mark
testimony by experts like,
Dr. Michael West.
The science of bite marks
analysis, is very accurate.
NARRATOR 1: When it comes
 to bite marks,
 West consider himself
 "The maestro."
 He's found bite marks
 on a decomposed body
 submerged in a swamp,
on a corpse that had been buried
 for more than a year.
 He's even used a bite mark
taken out of a bologna sandwich
 to get a conviction.
Now, that sounds impressive
matching a killer's teeth
to a bite mark
in a bologna sandwich,
although, you should know
that the defendant in that case,
got a new trial
after an autopsy report
found that the murder victim
had actually eaten
a small amount of bologna
consistent with the amounts
bitten off the sandwich.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-So, that sandwich,
was irrelevant to the case.
In fact, you could even argue
that it was actually Dr. West,
who was full of, say it with me,
-shit.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And-- that
is not the only issue
that has arisen
from his testimony.
There are now five cases
where he testified
for the prosecution
and where the charges
were dropped
or the conviction was
later over turned
and even West himself
has admitted that
he no longer believes
in bite mark analysis
for identifying perpetrators
and he doesn't think it should
be used in court.
And yet, incredibly,
every time a defendant
has challenged its validity
the court has
ruled it admissible.
And a key reason for that
is that judges often rely
on precedent
to decide what to allow
in front of a jury. So,
if a particular discipline
has been in court before
it is likely that a judge
will admit it again.
All of which means
that as the co-founder
of the Innocence Project
points out,
decisions about the validity
of science are being made
by people who don't necessarily
know much about it.
Historically, we had
a situation where,
two scientifically
illiterate lawyers
argued the bonafides
of scientific evidence
before a scientifically
illiterate judge,
so the 12 scientifically
illiterate jurors
could decide the weight
of that evidence.
And if you think about it,
that's absolutely terrifying.
Trials can often be a situation
when no one
really knows
what they are doing.
It's like a cooking competition
for toddlers,
hosted by a stray cat
and judged by goats.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Oh.
The tuna was under cooked
and covered
in cold spaghetti sauce.
You then for some reason
cover the whole dish
in honey nut cheerios.
-I loved it.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And look, none of this
is to say,
that there is not reliable
forensic science out there.
Finger prints and DNA
are obvious examples but while
we think of them as perfect,
it is important to know
they are by no means infallible.
The FBI has found
fingerprint analysis
could have a false positive rate
as high as one error
in 306 cases.
And a dramatic example of this
came after the Madrid's
train bombings in 2004
when the FBI arrested this
Oregon man, Brandon Mayfield.
He had never even
been to Spain in his life.
But, three separate examiners,
matched his finger prints
to one on a bag of detonators.
So, he was at that point,
completely fucked!
Until, investigators happen
to determine that,
that fingerprint actually
also matched someone else
who was in Spain at the time
and that blew the minds
of finger print experts.
MARK ACREE:
 We always assume
 that finger prints
 are very very unique,
 but what the Mayfield case
 demonstrates, is that
parts of a fingerprint
can be
so similar, it's possible
for two people to be
 identified to one print.
That's true.
It turns out that two people
can have finger prints
that are so close that even
experts can't tell them apart.
Meaning that we are
now this close
to finally proving my theory.
There is only one Olsen twin.
She's just moving very fast
-back and forth.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
She confuses your eye.
Now, I don't know how this
new information helps me, yet,
but when it does, the end is--
No! You frauds! You frauds!
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
And then-- there is DNA,
which is the gold standard
in forensic science for a reason
because in perfect conditions
it's seen as the most reliable
form of evidence, but
not all DNA tests are equal
and crime scenes can produce DNA
of widely varying quality.
NARRATOR 2: DNA is very fragile
 and easily mixed up
 at a messy scene.
BRAD HART: So, imagine you come
 across a crime scene.
You may have a pool of blood
but it may not just be
one person's blood, right?
The more contributors to that--
mixture of DNA
the more difficult it is,
to determine, whose DNA it was.
 Whose blood it was.
Exactly, it can be difficult
to tell whose blood is whose,
in a large pool of blood,
which is coincidentally,
the premise
of my new game show.
So, you think you can tell
whose blood is whose
in a large pool of blood?
It premieres on Tuesday night
and apparently,
-it's already been cancelled.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
But the problem here is,
lower quality DNA samples are
sometimes presented to juries
as if they are highly reliable.
In 2003,
a prosecutor in a double murder
told the jury that the odds,
the defendant's DNA match
the glove found at the scene
by chance,
was one in 1.1 billion.
So, that's pretty
strikingly impressive, but
it turned out the glove
actually contained at least
three people's DNA
and a later analysis
put the odds closer,
to one in two.
And you know what?
That's close enough isn't it?
People do confuse
the numbers 1.1 billion
and two all the time.
That's why I'm always
mistakenly saying
that my favorite R&B group
is Boyz 1.1 Billion Men.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And on top of all of this
there is one more fact
that can be impossible
to detect.
And it concerns the relationship
between law enforcement
and the forensic labs themselves
because you would hope
that those labs would work
independently taking in evidence
and spitting out results.
But many labs work closely
with law enforcement
knowing details
of the case that they are
working on
which can prejudice their work
even subconsciously.
Sometimes
it's not intentional fraud
but rather, something, um,
much more, uh, inadvertent.
Uh, which is the kind of bias
that can come from feeling like
you're part of a side
part of a team, that you--
you're part of--
you're attached
to the prosecution
and you wanna get, uh,
get the bad guy.
Yeah, but that's not their job!
At all! They are supposed
to be neutral.
If a referee,
started participating
in a team's end zone
celebration,
you'd have some serious
fucking questions,
like, why have you picked
a side?
And, how long you've been
practicing the dirty bird?
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
So, clearly here a lot needs
to be fixed
and some states have stepped up.
One has done a lot.
Including passing a first
of its kind Junk Science law.
Which enables convicts
to request a new trial,
if the sides used to convict
them was flawed,
and that sounds great and
the pioneering state that did
that by the way,
-was Texas.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Yes, I know!
-Texas!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
You don't expect Texas
to lead the nation
in science-related criminal
justice reform.
You expect them to lead
the nation
in remembering the Alamo
or naming
their children "Football."
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
"I love you Football but if you
ever forget the Alamo
-we are done."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Now, sadly, at the federal level
progress has been slow.
Although, one group,
the National Commission
on Forensic Science
has tried to fix that.
They were founded
to advise the DOJ on how
to address many of the problems,
that you've seen tonight.
And their most recent meeting,
featured powerful remarks
from Keith Harward,
who spent 33 years in prison
for a crime that
he did not commit
based on faulty
bite mark evidence.
Some would say, "Well you're
a free man," well...
I will never be free of this.
There's no possibility--
Excuse me if I get emotional.
That...
I spent more than half my life
in prison...
behind the opinions...
and the expert egos...
of two Odontologist.
There's a death penalty case
in Pennsylvania
that's going on now
and the judge
is going to allow
bite mark evidence.
How many people have to be
wrongly convicted
before they realize
that this stuff's all bogus?
It's all-- made up.
That's a good question
and it's also the kind of speech
that could really inspire
that commission
to do a lot of good work.
Unfortunately,
that was actually their
final meeting
because the commission
was shut down in April
by Attorney General
and xenophobic boss baby,
Jeff Sessions.
And know what?
That shouldn't really surprise
you anyways.
Sessions is a former prosecutor
and he does seem like the kind
of guy who watched
 Dead Man Walking and was
like, hurry up!
Let's kill the guy already!
This movie should be called,
"Dead Man Dilly Dallying".
Let's go people, let's go!
So, we may honestly be actively
going backwards on this issue,
which is dangerous,
because not only are innocent
people getting convicted,
guilty criminals are being left
on the streets as a result.
And if this administration
does not see this as a problem
then we should
at the very least,
do more to educate
potential jurors
about some of the short comings
in our system
and one small way to do that,
might be this:
NARRATOR 3: In this city,
 -when the heat rises...
-(SIREN WAILING)
 so does the murder rate.
♪ (ROCK & ROLL MUSIC PLAYING) ♪
Alright everybody, let's get
this stuff back to the lab.
Hey chief, no need.
Look what I found, bite mark.
Bologna sandwich.
Now, that's what I call...
-"Dead meat."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
Whoa!
The fuck is wrong with you?
Dead meat? This is a murder.
-That's a human person.
-That is his wife over there.
-You're a fucking asshole.
-(WIFE SOBBING)
NARRATOR 3:
 He's a crime solver,
 who doesn't like to play
 by the rules.
I'm getting something on these
bite marks here,
but it's far from conclusive.
Would you say
there's a reasonable degree
of scientific certainty?
No.
-That's meaningless.
-Right.
NARRATOR 3: And that's a problem
 for absolutely everyone
 around him.
Chief, the hair matches
the victim's wife. Case closed.
Slow down.
Microscopic hair comparison
is bullshit science.
Chief,
I ran a mitochondrial DNA test
on those hairs.
The wife did it right?
Case closed.
Actually, there were five hairs.
-Three were from... a coconut.
-And two were from... the wife.
One was
from a Cabbage Patch Kid
and the remaining one was from--
-The wife.
-This Golden Retriever.
There's our killer
right there, Chief.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-The victim was shot.
-How can a dog fire a gun?
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-That's a bad dog right there.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
And he's about to face some...
"Woof" justice.
We're in doors. Fuck you.
NARRATOR 3: And he won't stop
 asking the hard questions.
How 'bout a certainly reasonable
science degree to--
No.
Yeah, okay.
NARRATOR 3: Because
 he's passionate about his job.
Despite not fully understanding
 what that job is.
If we don't have something solid
by tomorrow,
D.A. is gonna have my ass.
Why would the D.A.
have your ass?
We don't work for the D.A.
-What?
-We don't work for the D.A.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-You do understand that, right?
Please, tell us
you understand that.
-Well, yeah.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
I understand that.
Totally.
NARRATOR 3: Oh, there's no way
 he understands that.
Because this guy, will not quit.
How about
a certainly reasonable--
-Stop talking.
-Okay.
-Keep up the good work.
-Okay.
NARRATOR 3: And even when
 his team abandons him
 he's not afraid to call
 for back-up.
-This better be good.
-Oh, it is.
I brought in some extra help.
Expert witnesses to help
lock in this case.
Take a look.
We got,
the Forensic Dentist,
Twin Boy Detectives,
an old timely prospector
with a divining rod,
sack full of magic eight balls,
and the county's foremost
crime sniffing pony.
-(PONY WHEEZING)
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
None of this is admissible
in court.
Actually, three of them have
testified in court before
and they all got convictions.
Is that the bologna
evidence sandwich?
Oh my God!
NARRATOR 3:
 CSI, Crime Scene Idiot.
