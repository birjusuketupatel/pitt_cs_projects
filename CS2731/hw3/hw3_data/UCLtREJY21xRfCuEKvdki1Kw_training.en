[Music]
welcome my dudes my doggies and my Kazee
boys to the gazebo only zone
I'm your host ethan klein i am sick as a
dog this is my beautiful pregnant wife
who I love and adore she's the angel of
my life in the light of my life she's
everything that I've ever hoped to find
a partner and so much more
Lila climb I am so sick I'm delirious
I'm out of it you know you're still
embarrassed by my introduction I see
yeah it's true it's all true and so much
more thank you I am so sick I am
completely out of it yeah I've been
pumped with all the quills the bacon
wheels the knight coils the Twilight
quills what do you get when you combine
nyquil and dayquil I'm in the Twilight
well right now and start a Wiccan quill
oh yeah after today I'm gonna be weekend
coiled out oh and thank you to our
sponsors audible me undies LinkedIn I
almost forgot about those great dudes
I'm so out of it so this is gonna be a
roller coaster ride guys thank you for
joining us on this beautiful blessed
Friday Oh
Friday don't we all love it so much yes
I'm happy to share this special day with
you all
we had Tom Segura and Christina P two of
my favorite people on the planet were
scheduled beer on Wednesday I was sick
unfortunately we're gonna get him back
on here soon I love those guys went to
Disney yesterday with my family which
made my illness worse so but you know
what that's enough about what's going on
in my life let's get to the science of
why we're all here today last week and
it's been part of the show mythology I
would say is we have these Twitter polls
which really illuminate I would say some
of the darker parts of our society not
dark in the sense of being tat being
unethical or nothing to be feared but
I'm on dark in the ocean shadows in the
shadows and that it hasn't yet been
uncovered or looked at
yeah we are we are great searchers
weirdoes great discovers we are now all
the pranksters do like social
experiments this is real [ __ ]
she's the parent dude I want to be
surprised to see some of these Twitter
polls being quoted in such reputable
articles as Wikipedia so we have one
last week about do you smell on your
hand and you fart on your hand and smell
it I'm so out of it
do you fart on your hand and smell it so
first we did do you like the smell of
your own farts
and most overwhelming obviously yes and
there was some nice don't understand it
like I got it kind of upset because I
feel like you were kidding but you're
saying that you're serious but like
you're kidding well the poll speaks for
itself
yeah so first of all there was some
disbelief that people liked the smell of
their own farts but then we took it a
step further we said do you fart on your
hand and smell it and most of the people
in here except for Zach who's only
honest being here was like what is wrong
with you they say they say Ethan you are
a you shouldn't exist they say to me so
let's go to this poll because this was a
prolific vote I would say this was a
paramount benchmark vote we took place
here
have you ever smart farted on your hand
and smelled it a hundred and twenty four
thousand votes that is a huge number and
let me say 51% yes mm-hmm
and after this poll I bet you it's gonna
go even higher we even saw a couple when
we were at Disneyland and the guy had to
tell me that he does it too yeah an
ex-girlfriend I said can I smell your
head
Eleni stew I sniffed his head he had a
turkey leg in it and it was a fart and a
turkey leg it was a great time we had
there Disneyland so there you have it
guys this is science this is real
science we're doing here amazing but
then so I got an email from a fan
a podcast at age six reproduction calm
and she blew my ass out with a new one
she wanted to broach with us mm-hmm
let me read this email from autumn
autumn gee hello Ethan and Ella lately
on the show you guys been talking about
your girls habits in ela almost every
time has said she does not share these
strange routines so as a heel kleiner I
admit when I'm on my cycle I will often
smell my blood nope
sometimes I find it satisfying and
sometimes I find it gross lately my
blood has smelled similar to red wine
and I've never smelled my blood when
it's in it oh she says and I never smell
my blood when it's in a tampon well how
does she smell it this so I hate the
smell and that is why I usually prefer
to wear a tampon cuz I think you don't
smell it as much but how does she smell
it you just from the toilet if you wear
like a pad yeah oh then you take it off
and it's kind of like a walk it's like a
strong odor I hate it
what does it smell like gross like body
odor or like blood but I guess you like
like stink
it's gross woah see as men I think all
the middle listening to this are like
wow I know we're not supposed to talk
about this it's like the ladies pack
girls don't poop they don't for it and
they don't have their area stink did you
all know that period stink [ __ ] no what
did you think I never thought about odor
being involved don't know maybe I'm not
describing it right but I find it bro it
sounds like you're right I mean she says
herself she sniffs her period blood
sometimes satisfying some do you ever
find it satisfying
I always gross sometimes more gross than
other times if I smell it more but you
think it's all equally gross because she
sinks sometimes it has extra stank
I guess that's possible I never thought
like it smelled like red wine does it
have anything to do with the volume of
blood that's in it probably and does it
have anything to do with the wounds
last time you changed your tampon like
if how much body odor and sweat gets
mixed in I don't know fascinating wow
this is new so you're saying that it
uniformly always smells bad and you even
go so far as to wear tampons to avoid
smelling it altogether yes so what I
want to post to our female listeners
today is um do you ever smell your
period but so we are gonna make a
Twitter pull Dan you've got the sugar
for ladies only head on over to a street
podcast on Twitter if your lady and cast
your vote do you ever smell your period
but now these are fully anonymous votes
so you don't have to worry about being
outed or being discovered or mhmmm
anyone knowing about your disgusting
habits which we all have so don't worry
but I am truly fascinated by this period
blood smell it's a new concept it's a
paradigm shift my understanding of
periods how was their early voting I'm
very curious so my initial refresh fifty
three votes and it's about 50/50 it's 49
51 right now we're gonna be 50/50 no
yeah of course no there's been huge
swings there's been huge we've had 70
30s and yeah yeah we had a 60-40 with
the front wiping yeah no that's what I
thought it would be I think would be I
expected that cuz I if I'm a woman and I
have stinky periods I'm smelling it
because I'm already saying I smelling my
farts I bounced climbing in that that
50/50 ratio in Houlton it's holding
steady I would think that I would be
smelling my period blood you think so
yeah I would be because I scratched my
balls and smell my hand I think I think
there's just two type of people in the
world I think so probably the people
like are in denial like me yeah you're
in I I do think that
true you look yeah because it sounds I
don't want it to be true because it
sounds like you do smell your period
you're aware of this man I hate it I
know but you but on some level you still
do smell and assess it and make some
analysis of it the fact is that you're
in denial and you don't embrace it as
something you know that you can get into
on a personal level right I don't know
I'm happy that I got nine months right
now period went out yeah but then it's
almost like the baby is almost like the
nine months of period throw it up and
it's just like sounds like a break and
then a burst
you got something going on just wave at
least it has a happy ending
yeah periods don't necessarily have
happy endings except that they're over
I'll be right there with you I haven't I
tell you I have so much admiration and
so much respect for nothing you have to
go through that and I'm not jealous of
that at all I'm truly appreciative date
yeah you need to do that because my god
myself no I know
I know that's another thing I'm in
denial about that has to happen yeah
well it's really just something it's
like up the baby's coming let's just do
it you just have to do it you just have
to do it but you're gonna get drugged
then you're you're gonna be smart about
it and just not the only thing because a
lot of women are like I'd want to do it
natural I got halfway through when
they're in the excruciating pain they're
like anything depending my sister is
crazy she she was like no pain killers
and she she really didn't take anything
throughout well your your sister's a
superhuman yeah she's a frickin nature
but in your case because the the reason
women don't better get is because it
could take longer right yeah thank you
are afraid that you because you're Nam
you won't push hard as much as you would
if you're not I prefer thank you from my
perspective to not feel pain and have it
take an extra five hours well well I'm
just saying that's an exaggerated
comparison but I think that you'll be
but
I agree with you uh you know you don't
want to trust me trust me a guy that
knows something about it I have a friend
who was like I don't want it and then
halfway through she decided she wanted
it but then it took longer because they
didn't have it prepared for her oh man
and the whole time she was just like
give me when you get the painkiller is
it like no pain like total numbness no
probably helped I think it helps but I
don't think because when I I had a young
I don't know I had a huge mole removed
on my back as a kid I think I must have
been uh you know 12 or 11 but it was a
really big surgery where they cut it out
and um when they gave me numbing shots
it was extreme extremely painful it was
so painful these shots I was it fries
cuz it was just a shot I think this one
is also painful but I felt nothing like
zero sensation and I was awake but I
think I think you're already in so much
pain from the country what do you call
it
contraptions oh the contraptions yeah so
I think the pain of that shot is like
driving yeah compare actions yeah so I
think I think they have amazing
medicines that I think will really
minimize the pain you experience but the
thing is like when I had the surgery on
my back so I felt no pain at all but
then when they finish they had to sew me
up and the doctor had to cut what do you
call that when you electrocuted
categorise cauterized he had to
cauterize my flesh together so he
basically he literally like burned my
flesh together and that was [ __ ] it
wasn't paid I couldn't feel the pain but
it felt so weird those being
electrocuted how'd that smell I didn't
smell flesh I just found it was just a
wild sensation dude but um yeah so
there's a couple people who responded I
do and I secretly think it smells okay
yeah there you go exactly I don't think
exactly I think there's a very
interesting and healthy discussion guys
as of this moment it's actually exactly
50/50 and then there
I'm not sure what to choose but you
can't avoid smelling it but it still
grows mm-hmm so there you go I think
there really are two types of people in
the world you know and I think now is
exactly 50 I think that's what it boils
down to you know people who are in
denial as you said and some people that
are like I'm on board with smelling your
variable Mike I bet you the same people
to smell their fear Perry Bloods also
smell their farts and they probably
catch their vagina and smell their hand
probably you know
all right well fascinating stuff here
guys this is a science experience
experience beautiful beginning
fascinating yeah I love it
what else we got here oh another fan
submission this was the best freakin
video I've seen in such a long time you
guys oh my god talk about TLC we've been
talking about TLC a lot so this comes
from Discovery oh and it's a reader yeah
yeah I know
they're like hang on guys we got to stop
make wait planet Earth
[ __ ] cancel that we're working on a
new show show called diagnosis or
diagnosed me and we're gonna do epic
reenactments of these of these diseases
now this guy run suffers from ceaseless
belching and cause he cannot stop
burping he cannot stop burping and they
reenact it and oh my god this is from
Devon Mears oh god but this is the best
thing I've seen its own
before his condition began it's kind of
scratch you hear that yeah here I think
I might know what's up hold on one sec
we're all set up here
very professional always prepared and
very live that's right folks how you
feeling you feeling pregnant I feel
really tired and I think that's part of
this yeah
stage how was Disney for you yesterday
as a pregnant lady I couldn't go on all
the fun rides like a boring mom I felt
so bad for you as I rode all the awesome
rides and I'm already lame yeah you're
not lame it's not your fault you're
amazing you have a [ __ ] you get
you're growing a human body in your
stomach that's amazing as a guest pretty
cool yeah you know laying your freakin
awesome wife recently that's love baby
and horse this is the reenactment I was
confused that was like what am I
watching
so the burping sound is insane it's
always like and what I soon learned is
that the burping sound bite they use is
a sound bite from the actual guy it is
so he's actually so what they're doing
is playing the actual girl and the guy
every time no you can tell because they
show one brief clip of actual guy
burping and so they use that one sound
bite and they use it every time in this
reenactment and it sounds it's the same
sound it's amazing
I'm sorry ma'am it started gradually and
east though like it's like you just burp
yeah it's tiny and he's always like I'm
so sorry ma'am control you know when I
was at the customer's house and then
when I was done truck I've just Belgium
Belgium Belgium so we've got the
pressure off me it seemed crazy maybe 20
30 minutes but what I don't understand
is why do you have to burp so loud just
close your mouth well you don't have to
burp loud I don't think he can control
it that's a show about it I don't think
I can control it
he's burping a lot but sure I mean you
could control how loud you burp you can
go or you can be like not always really
never heard you burp what do you know
about it
I see people burp but you burp quietly
right because you're a lady
I don't burn yeah
one of us should sleep you know all of
that line at least one of us should
sleep look at his waist anyway to the
neighborhood during series of tests his
doctor had a bowel obstruction and
suggests it's all in Ron's head stop
thinking about it so much belching
non-stop for months that's cuz that's
that's a burp I've never heard of birth
play at my life and so yeah has to be
they're using that sound by going to
dozens of doctors the one cure this yeah
they get out look at that babe vengeance
look at this reaction that seemed to
work just stopped working leaving Ron so
desperate he wants to kill himself and
then well I know I feel bad for the guy
but like they do this sound editing
where they'll take the sound by burp
like here and then they'll like dampen
it so it seems like he's far away but
they're just using the same sound buddy
Ron so desperate he wants to kill
himself
no they're making them look like all the
time just turning into it's like a
Stephen King novel but yeah he's like a
werewolf what is happening to me
dude finds out what's going on she
panics and calls 9 1 1 records they said
there's nothing we can do for you look
at this gas is a sign to mental health
counselor Lisa Gus in her questions open
up although he does this doctor when he
burped I didn't see the guy do that he
just fit every criteria for anxiety and
depression he my way turns out he needed
an antidepressant really and he was a
manifesting anxiety in an unusual way
and he's cured now fry believe it you do
know what's on discovery you can't be
wrong
they wouldn't lie to us hit me with that
soundbite Zach
that's the burb the first time I stopped
I wish I could watch the first time with
you guys because the first time I saw
this I was just crying he does this
[Music]
think he's worth being like a thousand
times a day and he's surprised every
time it happens baby D disorder combined
with clinical depression
I poke through those things where I'll
burp I guess I got out of the problems
stimulates the brain in a certain area I
love that that video can gem my dudes so
shout out Wow having a lot of fun here
dan what's the pull out let's take a
look
we've got refreshing 4951 man at this
this tree and favorite what well yes is
going down you actually the yes is
slightly down but I mean oh yeah it's 48
52 48 for yes 52 now oh so no is
slightly edging so that makes it feel
more realistic um I feel like the margin
error though like you got to say that's
it that's a split well the problem is
that you have to vote to see the results
and so a lot of dudes out there one is
that right
when I see the result it says ladies
only so I I know any dudes are voting
there's got it I wish there was a way to
view the results I agree about it's so
messed up because oh you know what you
got to add a third option that says I'm
a dude though then it doesn't affect the
fricken you know what yeah that's no new
everyone do a new one erase that one Dan
and start over with a third option I'm a
dude no vote impressed

premium made
guys welcome everybody thank you for
joining us so
wonderful to have you here i'm here
joined by the illustrious beautiful
eli cline my my pregnant beautiful wife
by the way i say pregnant beautiful wife
because ever since
that we found out you're pregnant and
we're always like all right you're still
pregnant because you
because it's like kind of uneasy during
the first three months because
you can have a miscarriage somewhat
commonly like 10 to 15
i read but i just i think it's so
amazing
you're so cool i always think that to
myself
they say apparently there's already a
heartbeat
that's unbelievable oh where it is and
they say
well this was we read they described the
baby that she has
as the size of a pip an orange seed
an orange seed but they called it a pip
which i thought was really funny a pip
squeak
a little pip but i just think it's so
amazing that eliz
has this little pip inside of her i
don't know i just
i'm so charmed by that i just think it's
amazing
and you've gained a little weight you've
been eating great she's super healthy
she's
radiant i'm already gaining weight let's
see how much
look at this i just i'm i'm so in love
with my beautiful pregnant wife
who's got this little pip inside of her
we've got our first ultrasound in like
uh two weeks
a week a week oh shh right
yeah i think it's two weeks i can't
believe it
it still feels so surreal but yeah
that's gonna make it feel real
yeah yeah sure there's your little pip
we're trying to think of a name maybe
pip
ela hates now go with your first
instinct pen for sure
just go for it at any rate guys let's
get into the show
i'm charmed to be here you're let's get
started right away with your goof of the
day there's a lot to get to
um under the gazebo here today
now this video comes courtesy of your
boy tom segura i saw this on his
instagram
and i had to share it with you
so this is a professional boxer who is
having
promoting a big fight he's having and um
this i'm trying to break this down for
you guys because it's so
it's so wild okay let me show you the
video so he's on a daytime television
show and some
mascot comes out dressed in a burrito
and um i think he was meant to punch him
in the stomach because you can see the
house being like
hit him right here hit him right here
and this box this is a boxer
a world-class fighter he punches this
[ __ ] guy in the
face as hard as he can dude and you
could tell
that burrito that tortilla padding just
isn't enough
so let's see who's usually inside those
two it's probably
not like a guy not someone who can take
a punch
so apparently something flew off
and so apparently he broke this poor son
of bitch's jaw and you see him writhing
around in pain and everyone's kind of
clowning on him
but he you see he's like trying to like
yeah
he's like dude i'm not okay and
everyone's clowning on him
he goes right in the stomach in the
[ __ ] phase
he does pat the stomach and then last
minute yeah
i think it's his fault really the host
well i don't know if anyone speaks
spanish maybe he was like punch him here
definitely don't punch him maybe
he just decked that poor guy he probably
had like padding like extra padding in
the stomach
yeah and nothing in there oh
so apparently he broke his jaw and this
guy said on twitter
i don't know it sounds ironic his
apology because it kind of gave me a
good goal he said
i sincerely apologize to the brave man
that was injured
i have the utmost respect for him his
part he's talking about the guy in the
burrito suit
i have the utmost respect for the
burrito boy
uh his participation willingness and
courage he says
true hero if this is true i would
personally like to invite him to my
december first fight are you
trying to give this guy flashbacks does
he have to wear his burrito costume
i don't know why i just it had me uh in
stitches frankly
uh he he tossed the he he beat the salsa
right out of the burrito
not a mexican joke a burrito joke let's
be clear i've gotten way more classic
integrity you can make race
related jokes about because they put
salsa in burritos
as well as rice and beans and stuff like
that i thought that was clear
do i need to make an apology
[Laughter]
um here's another good one
shannon your pizzas here okay
this is just a goofy we're just getting
started here we're lubing it up we're
lighting it up you know what i'm saying
so this person decided to order a pizza
and they put a sign on the door that
said scream
shannon your pizza is here do not ring
the doorbell or knock
our grandma is sleeping upstairs you
know i have to say
what do you think about somebody leaving
a sign on a door for pizza delivery guy
to scream shannon your pizzas here no
one would actually do that
yeah it's a kind of it's asking a lot of
a pizza guy scream
most people will probably not even read
the letter
i'm not about asking someone to scream
like i'm not
screaming yeah you know what i mean but
this guy
he he receives the note
and he reciprocates so what did the note
say again it said
scream please scream shannon your pizzas
here because my grandma is sleeping and
the doorbell will wake my nan up
so let's see how this uh brilliant mind
reacts to that
and look at this guy strutting up like a
thousand pizza like
this guy's a pizza god if i've ever seen
one he assesses the situation
he strolls up with the confidence of a
thousand fupas a thousand pies
i feel like there's no sound yeah
there's no sound oh well that's pretty
critical
do you have oh yeah i got it i fix it oh
let's try it again there we go there we
go
so foopish maximus approaches the door
with pizza in hand
the cru the crows are calling in
anticipation
of what's to come
and then she opens the door and screams
in her face too
now what i'm wondering is because asking
a pizza boy to shout
i wonder if this was his way of being
like [ __ ] you for making me shout it's a
little bit of rebellion
yeah malicious compliance well first of
all you know nana
woke the [ __ ] up from there you know
what i mean and second of all she opens
the door and he continues
to scream in her face so you know what i
mean
it's just so weird like i wonder if it
was a revenge because who
this guy really sees the opportunity
you know i love that the crows are
crying
i don't think i've ever screamed like
that
it's like he took a full breath
maybe this guy who's so passionate about
pizza understands he's like
they might be in the backyard they might
be in the attic they might be far i need
these people to know that i'm here
it's so dedicated to it this guy's a
legend
you read it exactly they've got some mr
pibb in the bag so that's
these are people that respect pizza and
sodi
because you don't order mr pibb unless
you're deep in it
what is that it's a off brown dr pepper
oh
she's laughing at this
i want more i want i want more i want a
reality show that follows this guy
delivering pizzas
oh my god pick that up
the screaming pizza man tonight on tlc
tlc is on fire yeah
oh my god tlc is on fire because we've
been making all these videos about tlc
and how insane they are
but i've never actually put on the
network and watched i'm like well
this is all amazing stuff why am i not
watching tlc
we started recording the channel yeah i
started i started saving on dvr all the
programs
been watching 90 day fiance holy
shits this is the best show on i swear
to god this is the most entertaining
show on television
um these guys will make a show about
any goddamn thing they have like five
shows about little people
and giant people and giant people
and everyone in between um
i have this whole segment but first i
wanted to show this tai lopez
is using me in a [ __ ] ad you believe
this guy remember we made that video
with tai lopez
yeah here h3 here in my garage with tai
lopez
it's an ad what the [ __ ] ty
this is all the meme layers i knew he
was good
i knew he had it all started from his
ads and now you're in his app what the
hell

youtube like two years ago
if someone told you this
would you believe it not for a second
either
i guess there is some kind of beautiful
poetry to to
you know acknowledging this
that i'm sitting in a lamborghini in a
tai lopez ad is pretty amazing yeah
that is pretty amazing jesus ty what are
you thinking doing this
we got to get him on the phone or
something
so anyway i just wanted to point out
that beautiful little thing that
happened
but i've got clips from 90 day fiance
okay so this show
first of all i got to tell you guys this
show every episode is two hours
long we just found out yesterday like
this [ __ ] is so consumable we
sat in bed the first episode we watched
and we didn't even notice
we thought it was 30 minutes it was just
all of a sudden it was like 1 30 am and
we're like whoa
how did that happen but yesterday we
were watching an episode
yeah and it's been forever and danny is
like how long is this it feels like
we've been sitting here for a while
and i was like i don't know 40 minutes
or something and we look and it's two
hours i've been already watching for an
hour and a half
and we thought we were watching a 30
minute show and didn't even notice
two hour episodes dude tlc is like las
vegas like
they hold you there you know in vegas
they like don't have lights or windows
they like hold you hostage there and
kind of like
hide the fact that you've been hostage
on their network for two hours and even
the commercials are interesting because
they show all their other weird shows
that they have until
there's lots of navaj yeah oh yeah i
like self-promotion little people
giant people you're just laughing at all
this so you don't
we didn't even skip the commercials we
really watched the whole two hours
right but um so 90 day fiance this show
the whole premise is so insane and i and
i
and i stress that i don't even know how
it's legal
because first it usually starts with
them overseas
well they have attorneys so it is legal
whatever it is i don't know
yeah they probably have some select
attorneys making sure that they're not
getting deported
but it starts overseas usually and then
they're bringing them over on some kind
of visa
and they have 90 days to decide if they
want to get married
because they have to decide the visa
expires in 90 days right so they have to
decide am i going to marry you
and immigrate or do i not like you
and i'm leaving and the people
well first of all the people that would
subject themselves to this are already
[ __ ] in the head right it's really
weird i don't know
they're apparently somehow in love they
met somehow that's how you usually start
i mean like who
no i mean first of all who would invite
tlc cameras
into the relationship during this
difficult time it's insane okay first of
all
second of all the way they select
couples is like incredible because
they'll
only they will specifically find
the people that and you look at them and
you say
there is no way that person cares about
the other person yeah because like my
favorite couple is this guy david and
annie
this guy david is a 45 year old he's
overweight
he's broke he has no prospect no
prospects in life
and the girl is like 20 24 right 24.
something like that and like and this is
the recurring message there's no
way that this other person cares so it's
like it's
so it's so
scant it's like so juicy
i am only now realizing that i love
reality television because
at first you react and you're like oh
this is garbage who watches this [ __ ]
but when you put on tlc all of a sudden
you're like
this i cannot turn off
i don't know last night yeah
last night the episode that we watched
which we're gonna show some clips of
it got really depressing i don't know
that i can keep watching it it's amazing
i wasn't depressed i loved every goddamn
second of it
i was getting like actually nervous for
them and
you guys gotta see this well for me i
was like [ __ ] you thought you got
marriage problems
tried dating david
thai massage this blew me out of my
chair
i said when i saw this i turned to
illinois says every
moment of my life however difficult has
been
has been worth it to watch this one
moment on tlc
i've lived the full life i said after i
saw this one clip
and i was watching this live in the
middle of a two-hour episode i was blown
away
so this guy david and this is his thai
fiance they're moving he's so
broke he can't even afford to
get his own place so they're mooching
off his best friend and staying in their
house so in this clip his best friend is
like well what are you gonna do for me
that you guys are staying at our house
and i'm telling you guys
wow i love this i have to leave my
country i have to
leave my family for i go to american
studying life with nothing no money no
job
but i believe in david make mistake i
believe in him
so beautiful i love this
tonight we're having drinks with chris
and nikki before they head back to
america
[Music]
when annie and i get to america we will
be living with chris and nikki it
makes sense because i don't have a car i
don't have an apartment i don't have a
house i don't even have a u.s bank
account
or whatever
[Laughter]
why does he specify u.s bank account
because he lives in thailand oh okay
at least he's uh charming young and
[Music]

Friday everyone we got a lot to talk
about we're talking about better help a
lot of controversy there we are talking
about there's been a story that lacroix
popular Sodapop drink which of which I
am a big fan is being sued for putting
cockroach poison and their drinks sounds
a little far-fetched horrible but is it
let's find out we're gonna take a deep
dive we've also got up Kanye West the
great Kanye West had a meeting with
Donald Trump that has got a lot of
people talking and so much more today on
the join me under the gazebo would you
please experience so let's start with
let's start from the top you're better
help okay now better help I think that
there's a lot of misconceptions going
around yeah I'm not we're gonna take a
deep dive know that wasn't going the
whole time was it no no
I'm not used that my laptop is also
right that's right okay all right where
was it you know can you join me into the
better help there's been a lot of
misconception about I'm talking about my
involvement with better hub okay let me
start from the top
better help is an online therapy service
okay which they've sponsored one of our
podcast episodes a couple of months ago
mm-hmm okay now a lot of youtubers have
been getting criticized lately for
having put better help reads on their
videos about mental health about them
being depressed and such and a lot of
people have been accusing them of being
predatory because they're like oh I'm so
depressed and here's better help they're
accusing them of exaggerating their
depression to sell better help or to get
a better help sponsor I don't know and
then people started going through their
Terms of Service and found some
concerning things there as well in the
Terms of Service there was something III
don't remember exactly there was
something like they can't guarantee that
something your conversation private
stuff like that like like you know weird
stuff and so first of all I want to make
clear okay first of all we had one
sponsor with better help that was two
months ago and the topic of mental
health was not brought up in association
with our read at all yeah and to the
best of my recollection I don't think
that we even talked about it in that
episode and it predated our update video
when I talked about being depressed by
month a month at least okay but here's
where I think people got thrown off
because PewDiePie made a new video about
it and he goes through the Terms of
Service and he points out a lot of
questionable things which is fine and he
doesn't like the service and he raises
good points about it
but the way that he presented
my involvement in it I thought was a
little misleading and a little out of
context and it made it look like I was
way more involved with this company than
I was or even that it made it look like
I used my being depressed yeah - somehow
sell better help so I want to show you
guys if I could please exhibit a this is
PewDiePie's video let me go back a
little bit so let's watch this so he
goes on here he's talking about a manor
house I was just joking by the way guys
everyone is a sociopath enter the code
Shan for your cheaper online therapy
today I would never have guessed it will
actually this was the case so this leads
to a lot of the sponsored videos of
these hundred hundred of youtubers being
about mental health which could actually
be a good thing but they are made so
that people sign up for the website
I'm Scott it's Scott for depression to
expression so he's saying there's all
these youtubers that are promoting
better help on videos about depression
he has a problem with that he doesn't
think that that's ethical so here's
here's what he shows here if you're
looking for anything to miss out on
don't miss out on this welcome to
expression whoa I actually messed up
there and completely serious before we
start I have so much respect for each
and every one of you for watching and
being why do you ask for my payment
information now okay as we know I've
been in therapy I've been just dealing
with a lot of stuff that I need to deal
with and I feel good anyways I feel good
that's what is that probably about so
you can access professional affordable
anchor me and counseling I just hit a
wall where it was it was gotten so bad
that it was basically either stop making
videos or disappear also this video is
sponsored by better help more action
about that so the way it's cut makes it
look like my video my update video was
sponsored by better health yeah exactly
and I saw what I felt when I saw it -
yeah and I thought it was I was like
whoa like why would that be there yeah
like that gives totally the wrong
impression
because I've never talked about better
help and depression ever that's when I
did the sponsor read two months ago I
didn't even endorse the product because
I have never used the service we checked
it to make sure we checked it to make
sure that within 24 hours of therapists
contacted us and they did so we did some
due diligence in that regard to test out
the service but I never endorsed it I
never said that I used it to treat my
depression either but it seemed but at
any rate let me let me say focus on this
that seems like the only reasonable
conclusion to make is that he's calling
me out which is I thought I was like
dude what the hell and I was I was
pretty upset with him and I contact him
directly and I was like hey man what why
what's the deal and he says he didn't he
didn't mean to make it look that way and
he made a comment trying to clarify but
people that read the comments compared
to people to watch the video is very
small okay so what happened here is that
Bobby burns this youtuber here made a
video about depression that's sponsored
by better help and he uses my clip in it
talking about depression so here let me
show you this any more videos I just hit
a wall work it was it was gotten so bad
that it was basically either stop making
videos or disappear forever so today's
video is going to be about YouTube
happiness but before we get started make
sure you click that notification bell
lets you know whenever I upload new
videos also this video is sponsored by
though you'll notice that it's from
Bobby's video but he cut out the context
to understand either way cuz the part in
PewDiePie his video yeah let me go back
it's just kind of like a supercut of
examples of people like it doesn't
really inform the butt line so
affordable ank you me and counseling I
just hit a wall I think he did it on my
he didn't do it on purpose but then I
just want to clarify yeah you know
because it makes it to us it did make a
difference
to make a connection between being
depressed and then from that company
yeah we didn't want to do that it's my
personal choice that we made so that it
was kind and so and I think that people
who is the biggest youtuber in the world
talking about those people take it
seriously and it looks like it I mean
that's how I interpreted I could be
wrong I talked to a lot of other people
that saw it that way too and it just
seems like but you can see basically
either so that don't work better help
more information about that at the end
of this video though again and he goes
on to to criticize criticize a lot of
youtubers he also doesn't really
criticize them harshly is more
criticizing the service of better help
names he names a lot of people and he
shows a lot of faces of people and you
know when you're PewDiePie the effect of
that is that yeah he was he was very he
was very tempered in his criticism he
wasn't like coming out no you know he
was being very he was being very
rational and fair about it I mean I'm
not Sarah but again I just want to clear
that up that that video was not in any
way sponsored by better we've only
worked with them once so okay but
regardless of that I think it's pretty
weird that Bobbi used that clip anyway
because I keep seeing that clip going
around of Bobbi using my clip talking
about depression but there's not a clear
separation so people think that I that's
not the case so let me just see here we
go so in response to the criticism so I
first of all I just want to make that
clear okay now in response to dirt I
think that there was some implication
that anyone that works with better help
is negligent a shill or irresponsible or
somehow selling out their fans and even
though I never mentioned depression and
my Reid I do disagree with that
assertion I do personally disagree with
that assertion
now let me talk about this I'm not sure
what first of all I'm not sure what I
could do to vet them more than I did I
mean in a in a perfect world I like the
service it seems interesting and it
seems like would be useful for a lot of
people mm-hmm like on face value seems
like a cool service they're owned by a
publicly traded company and they're one
of the most widely advertised services
on the internet across television radio
podcasting and YouTube so with all the
information available it's a perfectly
rational decision to think that it's a
good useful service and something that's
that's a good good to promote and I mean
again these guys are going through the
Terms of Service and picking it apart
and there's weird questionable stuff in
there but I don't think like this it's a
it's a weird standard to make that you
want the slip the expectation that
anyone you ever work with you're reading
the entire 20 page legal document of the
Terms of Service like I don't think
anyone very few people in the history of
YouTube have ever read the Terms of
Service and I'm willing to bet that if
they did read the Terms of Service they
wouldn't want to work with them because
Terms of Service is written to remove
liability so it always sounds bad
terminal service is meant to sound bad
and scary they're literally the purpose
is to remove liability so to expect
YouTube I don't I think that's a
slippery slope if you are expecting
everyone to read the Terms of Service or
every partner they've ever worked with
them on on face value it's as reputable
as it as a partner as you can have yeah
we've had some offers for responses that
we decline that happens but someone like
better helps like past all the questions
that you would normally ask you know is
they do have good reviews online when we
looked up yeah of course no they and and
look people can promote people decide
how they want to promote different
products I personally wasn't comfortable
promoting it in terms of me being
depressed and I wasn't personally
comfortable saying I've used the service
when I haven't but it seemed good and it
seemed like it'd be useful and helpful
so I promoted it as such now
I think people are just a little too
quick to throw others under the bus and
be way overly cynical about this okay I
understand that it can seem in poor
taste to promote better help in a video
about being depressed which I didn't do
for the record and I have never done but
from the flip side think about it from
their perspective someone like like
boogie Philip DeFranco Bobby burns I
don't know Shane well everyone think of
it from their side instead of being so
cynical and thinking that it's a
celebrity skin
to them it's a win-win it's like oh this
app is gonna help people it seems like a
good service and my videos promoted yeah
it's like you know be optimistic about
it and it feels like a win-win I mean
that's how sponsors Jam YouTube have
always worked like content like sponsors
have video game content you have a video
game sponsorship on it if you make car
content or tech content you have
technology or a car like like content
like sponsors that's how it works so
it's easy to see where people have come
from thinking that it's okay to pair
those up it seems like a win-win and so
I completely understand where they're
coming from and I think once again
people are thinking about it backwards I
think what has been happening is that
better help because there's been this
implication that people have exaggerated
being depressed to sell better help as
that is a very sad way to be really
shitty that would be very shitty and the
people that I've seen being called out
are people that I know have had a
history with mental health issues and so
I think it's kind of ironic to like real
and dogpile on these people you know I
think what I think you guys have it
backwards the people who are being
overly cynical people who have spoken
about mental health issues are the
people that are being approached by
better health right so it's not doesn't
start from wanting to sell better help
it starts from having these issues and
then better help comes in because they
see an opportunity yeah I think that's
how these partnerships have happened and
then finally I've heard this argument
that it's unethical for youtubers to
even make money from promoting service
about mental health that I heard that
it's unethical to take money for that it
should be done for free even and I well
who benefits from doing it for free
better help what you're gonna do free
copy reads we're better out there
business you know the capitalist society
that's the way the world turns I mean
saying it's illogical for youtuber or
immoral for youtuber to collect money to
promote better help is equal is is
similar to saying it is it immoral for a
doctor or a therapist or nurse to get
paid for their work because it benefits
people I mean this is a capitalist
society we this is how at what point
what where does red line at what point
does it become immoral right
there's therapists the charge $50 an
hour $200 an hour $500 an hour at what
point does it become immoral for
therapists to charge 50 large now or
$500 an hour their service not valuable
is that not the capital is is not a
commodity I mean you know what I'm
saying if they're better at it do they
not deserve to get paid more so this
blanket statement that it's somehow
immoral to sponsor online therapy
strikes me as an odd one and not one
that makes much sense especially could
sitting here in the United States our
hospitals our doctors everything cancer
treatment for chrissake is heavily
monetized yeah and I personally find
that to be disgraceful but are we saying
that they shouldn't get paid at all they
should they volunteer I mean it's a it's
an argument that doesn't make much sense
to me and it falls apart in my mind when
you
to break it down it's a nice it's a nice
stop but it doesn't really make that
much sense now once again I want to
acknowledge this is somebody I worked
with one time months ago and I never
promoted them in context of being
depressed and I never said that I used
their service to treat my depression I'm
not a doctor I'm not journalists I'm not
a lawyer this is my opinion feel free to
disagree but I've been watching this
kind of devolve and I think that people
are being way overly cynical about this
and it's just another example of like I
don't know it just feels like one of
these things that just making YouTube
even more toxic mm-hmm
like even more distrustful of people and
even more cynical of each other and the
people and I just don't know why and and
I I don't know I just didn't feel it
just doesn't feel right this whole thing
and sure some people are being
opportunistic probably some but that's
always gonna happen yeah I don't know
someone now there's there's been a lot
of controversy about Philip DeFranco
because he was apparently sponsored with
them and dunno I don't know anything
about what Philip defranco's up to not
commenting at all about that and I know
like he had been connected somehow with
Shane's better help sponsorship he's not
connected to us at all ours came through
an agency and let me say this by the way
when you work with sponsors we work with
a lot of sponsors here on the podcast
they come through agencies that vet them
I check for their credibility to collect
payments and make sure they're legit
okay because obviously yeah so obviously
we as business owners and as
entertainers are not going to read the
Terms of Service of all of our partners
that's insane nobody has time for that
so we entrust our agency to to verify
the legitimacy of these companies and I
don't think they failed in this case I
mean we think about it too I don't just
pass the buck completely them I make a
conscious decision to work with someone
or not but in this case I don't regret I
I mean like yeah there's some
questionable things in terms of service
but let me say this with the information
I had at the time I made the right
decision
and and and that's it you know I think
if you want to criticize the company
that's one thing and that's totally fine
but yeah to come at youtubers who have
worked with them seems overly cynical
and toxic and it's just not now I don't
know she's not necessary I don't know
and you guys another crutch of this
argument is the implication that people
don't there's so many sponsors available
on YouTube now you don't have to act the
press to get a sponsor on YouTube mm-hmm
you really don't I mean I don't know it
just it make it I don't know if that
whole thing just made me feel really sad
I felt really bad honestly when I saw
Felix's video and kind of the way it was
portrayed I'm not gonna lie I felt it
felt really awful and I know we didn't
mean to do it
but like I didn't want people to think I
know a lot of people were getting the
wrong and I felt bad for all the other
people he named to because it's like
these are people that already have been
dealing with stuff and it's like it's
like man I don't know just overly
cynical and again I chose not to talk
about my depression people make
decisions I didn't want to do that but
that's just my opinion you can feel free
to disagree with me and that's fine okay
we can have dissenting opinions you
don't have to come [ __ ] murder my
family and [ __ ] down my throat
because I happen to have my own opinion
about this I think YouTube's gotten way
too [ __ ] toxic way too overly cynical
and when you start throwing good honest
youtubers under the bus that I think
they're I think we need to reel it back
[Music]
welcome to the h3 podcast extravaganza
that's right we're an extravaganza now
thank you to 23andme
posts mates and hims for sponsoring us
and thank you to everybody for joining
us today on this beautiful blessed
Friday
boy do I love Fridays we started taking
the weekends off and I just kidding
Fridays now mmm
happy Friday to everyone watching we've
got a lot to discuss today we're very
excited we've got some Chane updates
we've got some Pappajohn updates we've
got some buffing updates we've talked
previously about a guru for goofus slap
a slap a boo from goombah slap and Ian
the intern has prepared for us one of
his notorious and much celebrated
PowerPoint presentation on deciphering
the meaning of Kanye West wow that's a
big task oh but I know it wasn't up for
it but before we get into all that I've
got a little announcement not really an
announcement just something I wanted to
talk about but it may be that ela is is
there's a new thing of the thickening it
was gonna be thickening up here soon
what does that mean what I'm trying to
say is that ela won't be drinking
alcohol if she's responsible what I'm
trying to say read podcast extra no
that's me sorry I how long is that going
oh it just started like just now you
turned it off of me okay and flashback
[Laughter]
there's two stripes she's cooking
something up anyone it's a cinnamon roll
with frosting man yeah it's weird
[Laughter]
there's something going on
[Music]
well it's we we don't know yet if
anything's gonna go wrong she's pregnant
less pregnant I have been I've been
squirting an ela for years I mean I'm
just going frankly like we've been I've
been I've been you know what I'm saying
and depend on we've talked about it a
lot on the podcast so it's a natural
extension of our efforts to get ela
knocked up and I have been a fully
unsheathed about New Year's dick has
been out and flirting we did the test we
did everything but I'll say that we got
what happened naturally in just the good
old-fashioned way he had sex yeah you
know I know it is gross I don't know I
don't know I don't feel about it well
just like two days ago two days ago we
found out yeah and ela she would admit
was a couple of days late on her period
and her boobs were raw how would you say
tender what your boobs were tender it
just hurts I don't know get some tender
s pity but anyway that's like what
happens when you're getting in the
period and I remember it was like a week
earlier like oh I'm getting my period
yeah and the night before I was like
maybe you're pregnant jokingly yeah and
I was like actually I already checked
and it was negative all right but it
wasn't your first idea the more didn't
do it right yeah yeah but it's
interesting cuz the last two months we
kind of didn't really try we're like
[ __ ] this [ __ ] whatever if it happens it
happens and we're just not gonna pay
attention and of course that's when it
happened so funny yeah of course and I
don't wanna feel about I'm scared I
don't know how they feel about it it's
terrifying I'm more scared than
you cuz you gotta [ __ ] it yeah I have
utmost respect for that I'm telling you
that and people always say like don't
tell until I don't know for months I
don't know it's like it but then you're
gonna see that I'm pregnant
like was just superstitious yeah or but
you had a really good point about
because people think that maybe
something will go wrong but it's like if
that happens then why I'm not supposed
to talk about it like it's a secret
yeah exactly you just carry this like
sad thing yeah I'm good and you don't
tell you can't because I guess the
theory is I think first of all people
are superstitious mm-hmm second of all
for those that don't know in the first
like I don't know couple months it's
very common that you can have a
miscarriage and I didn't know don't know
yeah because it's like you don't talk
about it why not talk about like you'll
say when you're sick he'll talk about it
yeah or if you have to do a surgery so
why is that like oh you're right and
it's a it's a sad thing it's a
vulnerable thing and it's kind of sucks
to just carry that silently with you I
mean yeah but I I guess the theory is
that yeah people probably just are
superstitious about it and then yeah
maybe it happens sometimes people have
like many miscarriages
mm-hmm it could happen like five times
and you're like oh [ __ ] I got to do this
whole thing like but ELA approach me a
couple days ago and she's like eath I
was in bed just looking at the news or
something
she's like Ethan we got a problem or
something and I didn't answer for a
minute yeah just kind of groggy you said
something like two stripes yeah and I
was like no way yeah when I did the test
I felt like I felt like there's no way
like oh yeah y-you know the boys can
swim
it's good to know though because it was
kind of where I was worried that you
know you worried that's what's wrong
what's going on
you know why can't I I can't why can't
they
it ended up taking birth control like
maybe almost two years ago at this plant
so it could be that can take a while
yeah but so my so it worked the boys can
swim the girls can catch and the team is
functioning

before we knew she was preggers she was
like I'm hungry like yeah she started
eating she had pizza and she's like and
I have to tell you this but this was
shitty pizza and I'm not one to say that
because pizza and my opinions like sex
when it's good it's great and when it's
bad it's pretty good but no I'm like
this pizza is kind of sucky and he'll is
like really this is the best pizza I've
ever had and I'm just not that good but
I think elos starting to get hungry
yeah even happens that early but I can't
I have been I don't know we said you
feel something going on in your stomach
yeah
feel like things are moving in my
stomach it's a [ __ ] baby dude so
anyway so guys don't tell anyone
yeah don't tell anyone please until 10
weeks it's between all of us and I don't
know how to feel about it and we've been
trying for a while but I was like just
so used to not getting pregnant I was
like oh cool I was like cool man [ __ ]
that [ __ ]
but now how am I gonna take care of a
kid when I'm so dysfunctional ela
believes I mean that's all that matters
well anyway Neil is pregnant so there
you have it that long yep thank you that
is true that's how I feel so we thought
we'd share that happy news with
everybody and thank you for joining us
on this blessed Friday to share this
beautiful wonderful news me inside
internally
[Laughter]
let's move on we've got Shane now the
Shane documentary we had talked about in
a previous episode and I give Shane all
the credit in the world I mean this guy
has pioneered a new form of content on
you okay and he's had this incredible
fan base and he the numbers are just
like unfresh that has six hundred
thousand likes when a tweet yeah what is
going on yeah it's wild so I mean
obviously hats off to the to the guy
he's a friend of the show even though
even though even though he betrayed me
after all we've been through okay cut
you were not yet we'll get there nyah
let's at least get into a little bit
before the Papa father yeah exactly and
reliving the memory of that great
betrayal anyway so he goes on as we
touched on in the last step so the chain
starts exploring this theory what if
Logan is the sociopath and Jake is
living in the shadow of Logan the
sociopath took a weird turn
we just all became about it who is a
sociopath and right like well the next
episode was him sitting for like 40 or
50 minutes with a therapist and super
dramatic kind of she's really dramatic
it's kind of trying to diagnose him and
anyway Logan Paul made a response video
and I mean a lot of people have been
criticizing Shane for his kind of the
way that he's been trying to diagnose
him because he does this funny anything
that's there he's a really good at yeah
where they created this like horror they
create an atmosphere attention and that
it was very good they're good at it but
it's like you're also talking about
something serious you're talking about a
real person you're talking about mental
health and we know it's big Paul logo
Paul which are like the - you know Daria
YouTube but regardless I'm not even
trying to make a serious point about
channel I don't I honestly I'm not here
to refute or talk about any I honestly
Logan Paul made a response video and
it's given us through us all here one of
the best gems that have ever come across
this platform and so this to me was what
was most important to share with you
guys
I'll let Logan speak for himself now he
he goes on the record he's and he
actually says I'm not a sociopath but I
do have sociopathic tendencies which is
interesting it sounds like he's been
diagnosed the way he talks about it
because he's very knowledgeable and he
goes you're not either a sociopath or
not a sociopath it's a sliding scale and
some people have more sociopathic
tendencies
yeah others but he goes on to say
something that really resonated with me
and made me really understand what he
meant by that so I'll share it with you
guys now there's a sociopathic mark jobs
no Steve Zuckerberg Mark Zuckerberg and
Steve Jobs a lot of people especially
youtubers and strain touched on this you
can't just say like you're a sociopath
the word I would like to use is
sociopathic tendencies so a lot of us me
included
we'll do some thumb should be some stuff
that lacks empathy strictly for views
right it gets us views which gets the
subscribers a motivating factor is to
reach the next next next level sociopath
is boil down someone who is just more
savage than everyone else I know it
sounds so that's it
I mean that's pretty much a clinical
definition of sociopaths somebody who is
more savage than everybody else and I
think Logan for that definition and I
just think and I'm just happy that
that's in the world Logan Paul saying
it's just someone that's more savage
than everybody else
double dab double dab will do ya
motivating factor is to reach the next
next next level sociopath is boil down
someone who is just more savage than
everyone else I know it sounds I just
I have double with that I'm having
trouble with comparisons I was making it
cool for his fans cuz they're always
like savage yeah that's what so savage
means cool right in his world yeah so a
sociopath I think a case antisocial
personality disorder which is someone
that lacks empathy someone who has a
Jenner I mean there again I'm not gonna
do it's not a it's not generally it's
not I want to call it sad come on call
it savage necessarily you know maybe a
psycho and then Ethan did you go to
psychology school cuz I am NOT a I am
NOT a trained professional it sounds to
me it does some very clinical yeah that
it sounds like something you're here in
a classroom this whole argument though
that between him and Shane like it's
just I feel like which shouldn't be this
whole thing about self diagnosing and I
feel like even Logan's definition is
wrong because I was trying to read about
it online and educate myself a little
bit before I came into this podcast and
apparently sociopathy isn't even a
clinical term the real clinical term is
antisocial personality disorder and it's
just this whole messy thing I don't like
that it's just I don't know but everyone
always just googling and self-diagnose
yeah and like but anyway Logan's
defending himself he does make a lot of
good points in here but a sociopath is
basically some of this more savage so
I'm gonna add that's through the wiki
page yeah essentially we need to add
that to the clinical definition but it's
someone that lacks empathy someone's
very manipulative someone that doesn't I
mean they lack empathy they cannot
relate with human emotion so it enables
them to do more callous things that many
of us would not feel comfortable doing
from an empathetic standpoint and so I
guess that would make them literally
more savage and a psychopath which is a
problem Shane kept comparing saying a
sociopath in a psychopath with the same
playing and implying I don't think he
said it's the same thing but he wasn't
very clean and but like he kept mixing
them up at some point yeah
well he would say sociopaths and then he
would show Psychopaths on the screen and
like someone with a knife so I was
reading about this trying to figure out
what is the difference so actually all
psychopaths are sociopaths but a
psychopath is a more severe version of a
sociopath they tend to be more violent
they tend to be more criminal and they
tend to be more ruthless mm-hmm a
sociopath can still have bonds with like
family members and strong friends but
random people and did they meet on the
street they do not have any empathy for
at all mm-hmm so there is a distinction
but this implication that they're all
you know creepy murderers yeah is not is
not true but at any rate at any rate
that's that then there was a part at the
end of Shane's new I'm checking out on
this on this documentary honestly it's
so long - it's a lot but this part made
me uncomfortable I'm not gonna lie so
here he's teasing this one's called the
enemies of Jake Paul and he is teasing
in the next episode this therapist that
he sat down with is gonna go undercover
as a producer secretly they're not gonna
tell Jake Paul so that she can study him
all day and make a diagnosis of him
it seems kind of unethical I mean I'm so
here dad the whole thing is making me
uncomfortable honestly he Shane does
acknowledge that I mean he knows that
it's weird still gonna do it but anyway
here it is
and she's there too whole time I don't
think he's going to be like themselves I
think he's gonna be comfortable I think
he's going to be kind of a fake so I
came up with a plan it sounds really
shady plan is I'm gonna pretend to be
he's going to be watching like that's
how she makes her diagnosis like she's
this is her all day I just love the
image of this therapist with them all
day like this just looking at the side
of her vision at them anyway it's free
weights tray I don't know man it's just
strange like I mean
what do you think well first of all let
me say this Jake specifically is cool so
there you go I don't know I didn't like
I think it's unnecessary because if you
if she went like Jake would still be
himself over a long day you know if
they're at his house well I guess you'll
put on a show for like five minutes but
eventually he'll be himself a sociopath
apparently is capable and well aware of
the facade that they put on mm-hmm
actually what I read is that a
psychopath so a sociopath generally is
more messy and how they present
themselves to the world but a psychopath
is extremely efficient that they can
have a mask up all the time even under
stress and duress so that they never let
their guard down yeah
so it is one of the attributes but that
being said I really don't think I really
don't think Jake is a sociopath yeah
it's yeah I the thing is he didn't
really need this whole angle I would
have been interested in just one a
really sincere look into Jake Paul's
life like I don't know why the day with
him yeah I don't know that we needed
this really dramatic mm-hmm angle of
sociopathy yeah you know PewDiePie made
a beauty buddy he made some good points
about a really long video but he was
like when they were talking about
sociopathy him and the therapist were
saying that it was like a key--and gross
yeah I guess a I don't know what do I
know but it's getting bizarre ahh mmm
it's a wild ride man this is some wild
new territory here people are loving it
yeah and the thing is it's Jake Paul so
it's hard for anyone to be like it's
very difficult ever take Jake or Logan
sight like Logan made a very reasonable
response to to Shane's video and has
yeah he did like I was I was feeling
kind of bad it like here like they're
down votes is like 130 thousand down and
he didn't really say anything worthy of
a down though personally my
that's the world we live in hmm that's
the tube we tube in so uh I'm not gonna
lie I'm gonna watch it I'm gonna watch
it
it seems unethical but I'm gonna watch
them what else we got
Cavanaugh Cavanaugh this [ __ ] guy
this Cavanaugh guy he's trying to get on
Supreme Court again there's a lot of
politics going on here you guys probably
heard of Cavanaugh and how he was
accused of all this sexual misconduct
which is sexual misconduct that's a nice
way of saying rape kind of but
regardless of what he did or didn't do I
don't know my only interest in this my
friends is the fact that they are
arguing over what is a booth now boo
thing is a big part of this show as you
may recall we have been trying to get to
the bottom of what a booth is for a long
time I feel bad for the right into the
equation a booth and a goof and the gaff
is a laugh what happens if you boof a
goof now we were wondering what's a
booth and Eric from common etiquette
came in with a definition as we were
wondering what is a booth and I look it
up it's not actually word but you found
it on urban dictionary hell yeah the
best which is the perfect place to
define something like this apparently
and correct me if your definition is
wrong it's when you shove drugs up your
ass when you go to a rave or dance party
you booth it in yes we're on the same
page that's act so actually I've got a
revived that definitional that I'm
pretty sure it means taking drugs up the
ass because what I've heard because
apparently the the anus the colon is a
very absorb absorb if absorptive and so
drinking is like you know and it's like
you do an enema we don't it's like this
you know this mean where it's like I
sleep i I'm awake so drinking alcohol in
the mouth I sleep booting alcohol in
your ass I'm awake
refers to flatulence yes so basically
the same anus sucks and as way more
membrane so if you're taking any kind of
illicit drug you put it up the ass Bowl
and you all gonna be get taking that one
great ride ticket to Valhalla if you're
willing to do that you don't have to
taste it you don't have to encounter any
bad so you just boof it right up there
what do you shotgun a beer up your ass I
don't know how that works I heard there
was kids that were dipping vodka or
tampons in vodka and then shoving it up
there I'd get drunk
it's like Jesus drink like a shot it's
drinking but apparently you get drunk
quicker and it's a pleasant experience
but I just I love you know postpones
okay count you in five four three two
hello everybody and welcome to the h3
podcast experience also known as the
correct opinions own disagree with the
opinions here take a you might want to
think twice because these are infallible
highly uninformed and 100% correct all
the time couldn't possibly be wrong yet
it's not an option it's not not in this
cell with me is the beautiful talented
and very blue ela Klein round of
applause what else and a CEO
yeah and CEO of course thank you to
today's sponsors kaptara equipped and
the undies and for all of our loyal fans
and listeners there is a new h3 h3 video
out on our channel h3h3 productions so I
hope you enjoy that check it out please
enjoy it today we've got a lot to get to
I've got a new mic how do I sound today
we've got the Shane Jake documentary I
want to talk a little bit about that
Bill Cosby has started a new sitcom in
which he goes to prison which is a
really I'm really looking forward to
that's on NBC premieres this fall at 8
p.m. looking forward to Bill Cosby goes
to prison we've also got Drake and
Millie Bobby Brown have been raising
eyebrows with their salacious I feel
like that's over the top interesting
relationship and much much more
oh welcome everybody to the h3 podcast
experience all right thanks for coming
everyone we really we got the best we
got the best stuff here to talk about so
from the top Shane and Jake Shane Dawson
is the king of YouTube yeah these past
couple of I want pretty crazy he's been
kind of the king of YouTube for like
past year or something but these whole
documentary and series have just been
over the over the top like can you pull
up his channel I want to show you the
views that
got there but right now he has just come
out with a Jake Paul documentary called
inside the mind of Jake Paul when he
tries to understand really what's going
on with that guy and I'm intrigued let's
see a little is here look look at all of
his recent views why does that look so
low-quality
is that just part of the thing 16
million 14 million 18 24 million I mean
this is just this is average yeah this
is insane
this is like new level [ __ ] so anyway
his new documentary about Jake falls out
look at this I loved this
Jake's response to part one was number
two trending with 2.2 million views in
two days and Shane's video with 10
million views in one day wasn't on
trending I don't
damn what the hell what's the logic how
do you trend Jake Paul's response video
I don't know why can they just fix the
trending page it's like it's just not a
trending page it's not and if it is
curated why do they keep training Jake
Paul yeah if there's really no good
explanation for why this would be there
not that one it literally is
counterintuitive
yeah their response isn't what's
trending it's the topic itself it's just
it's it's maddening but regardless they
took the crutch of it is that he's
trying to see if Jake Paul's a sociopath
and I personally don't think that Jake
Paul's a sociopath I mean that's a tall
claim but then it takes this twist where
he's like well maybe he's a brother
Logan is the sociopath and it's about
him living in the shadow of his brother
which is a really interesting twist and
I definitely can see that I could see
that yeah I can see that for sure so I
am looking forward to seeing how this
series unveils but there was by the way
I think Logan was blindsided by the
whole thing because Jake and his video
was like I knew it was about sociopathy
and
he's like I'm not a sociopath so come
make this documentary about me he's like
it's gonna be a good PR for me [ __ ] the
Logan I think was blindsided that he was
all the sudden coming under the
magnifying lens and he just tweeted out
this morning this I really didn't want
to but I feel compelled to give my
thoughts on Shane series this far Blair
and then Shane actually responded a
surprise extended finale which is a
shame really don't give a [ __ ] he's
ready but anyway the really intriguing
thing for me and I am I am the I'm
intrigued you know I'm I'm glued to the
set here in fact Shane has given a lot
of youtubers hope kind of with how his
channel just turns second yeah well for
a long time he was a guy that just
taste-tested fast food yeah and they did
it for so long I don't know what he was
doing before that that was probably he
did like sketches and she had I don't
know he's not he has two channels he's
been kind of like been around forever
and doing all kinds of different content
but he was like just eating food for a
long yeah but he likes it slugged
through it found his voice yeah and he
really he's got this second wind that's
unbelievable
it's really cool I really like the style
of the document innovative it's fresh
it's really well edit yeah I don't know
who's editing that I'm sure Shane is
probably sitting there a lot with editor
but then editing yeah absolutely bananas
he wears the same shirt in every video I
don't think so
well I don't know if it's the same sir
but either that or he's like Doug funny
and he's got like you know you never
done but he's like and we're doing named
outfit every day and but then there's a
episode where he walks in the closet and
he just has like morning same outfit he
wears the same shirt god bless his soul
you know but hey but there was one
moment here that really broke my heart
there was a moment in the new episode
that really broke my heart as a fan as a
call I want to say colleague but maybe
an associate you could say as
who's had him here a guest on our
podcast yeah it really broke my heart
so here it is I'm really gonna talk
about this if you notice anything here
I've gotta miss the time stamp for
Christ's sake see if you notice anything
here okay as he's talking about this
okay listen closely my friends
you're all gonna really this is really
upsetting podcast on a podcast damn
no we're smitten Shane breaking my heart
Shane you're breakin my heart go and
watch podcast on a podcast Shane
family this is my godfather impression
what family you come in my house you sit
across the table from me what I could no
respect to disrespect you so much they
you come on a podcast we you have a
podcast in my mind it sounds like a
perfect Italian Godfather impression
spot on she never gets the family and
you breaking my heart
no it's half Russian she you're breaking
my heart on a podcast
anyway god bless him I'm not upset I
just thought it was funny I just thought
it was a funny opportunity to do my well
traveled well seasoned Godfather
not one in the pocket for a while here
at the office yeah I'm working on that
eye Godfather accent for a long time so
did you change your mind by jakub or
anything no I never thought I kind of
always suspected that Jake deep down
isn't a bad guy mm-hmm I had that
impression when I sat here with him and
I thought you know because I I had a
conversation with him outside off-camera
and I was like dude tell me straight
good we were walking to the bathroom
together and I was like and this was
during their heyday when they were
really competitive I was like tell me
hey yeah do you how are you guys cuz it
seems really toxic and he's and he said
honestly it's really bad we honestly
really hate each other
you know he told me that in complete
earnestness off-camera in the hallway
he's like it's really bad honestly you
can tell that they're complete
competitive its mentality is real well
apparently Logan actually really [ __ ]
Jake's ex-girlfriend
like for real and then made like a diss
track about it but Jake was like dude
like like act like I know that's like
good for views but that actually really
hurts my feelings
mm-hmm you know like these guys are
[ __ ] twisted yeah but apparently Jake
actually gets into a lot of this stuff
so I'm looking for that but if you can
hit me with that music one more time
Shane I bring you one here we talk we
sit across the tip this is getting
better
Shane what I bring you here you sit
across the table for me we talk we have
a good time what do I do
Heelys give me the crickets moving on
Bill Cosby there's a new sitcom coming
up on NBC which is a really ballsy play
on their part
Bill Cosby goes to prison for sexual
assault I was like wow that's a really
edgy idea wait hold on it's not a sitcom
Bill Cosby in handcuffs after getting
over three years in prison for 2004 rape
wait I thought this oh man I thought it
was just a sitcom yeah
welcome to Papa's house aka prison the
clink
is that crazy at the same wait handcuffs
dude it is the weirdest timeline can we
just reflect on the fact that 81 year
old Bill Cosby worth four hundred
million dollars mm-hmm America's most
beloved entertainer jell-o eaten coke
sip and Bill Cosby is going up just
America I was like yeah it's going to
prison at 81 years old for rape
that's the weirdest timeline imaginable
mm-hmm oh my god
he was convicted in April of drugging
and sexually assaulting Andre constand
who testified that Cosby violated her at
his Pennsylvania home in 2004 after she
came to him for career advice she was
sentenced to 3 to 10 years for sexual
assault
he has to register as a sex offender
he's classified as a sexually violent
predator online and they need to inform
all their neighbors that a sexually
violent predator lives in the area
that's a lifetime registration although
I don't think his life is gonna be that
much longer
81 in prison he's in general population
- a lot of people are like oh he's gonna
get
preferential treatment listen to this
he's in general population and he's so
famous you know what they're doing
because when he talks to his wife in
prison they have speaker phones and like
everyone around can hear oh is that yeah
it's all monitored cuz it's a [ __ ]
prison
you know I mean they always in the
movies so everyone can hear yeah okay
near or if you're the police if you're
working there you're listening to what
they're talking about yeah and so people
are paying they want to know everything
he's talking about with his wife
what saw all these tabloids are
publishing everything he's talking about
with his wife they can do that well
that's how they found out I mean prop no
I'm sure it's probably illegal but
people are getting paid here's some of
the anecdotes that came out of those
phone conversations in a phone call with
his wife Cosby recounted that a hot dog
bun was thrown at his face Cosby who is
legally blind said he fell down a flight
of stairs because he wasn't being guided
and was without his cane which was
apparently taken away along with his
shoelaces by correctional officers over
fears that he may harm himself
Cosby told his wife grabbed the
checkbook and hire anyone and everyone
who could get him out as soon as
possible this [ __ ] worth 400
million bucks and that money cannot save
him this article says he said I think
I'll harm myself no the officials think
he'll harm himself
I mean Oh Cosby tells wife officials oh
he he told his wife though officials
think I'll harm myself because they took
away his cane and his shoelaces as I
understand this normal hmm but god damn
can you imagine you're just like in
prison and you're like oh it's Bill
Cosby no hey Bill oh and here's another
great one his first meal
in prison vanilla pudding you put the
pudding and the you put the hot dog mud
in the face of the pudding at the mouth
really showing off your impressions is
the impression experienced agency [ __ ]
profession experience Hey but che how
could he do this to me
you put the pudding you came here I gave
you pudding if you said a podcast how am
i doing impression 10 anime crossovers
right there so I think it's so pathetic
so weird
people are throwing hot dog buns at his
face like like that's maybe the biggest
fall from grace of all time like
Shakespeare the Greek mythology have
stories of from king to peasant I mean
this is a literal story of being Bill
Cosby beloved powerful rich beyond
imagination to inmates
throwing hot dog stale hot dog buns at
your face well the guy was a [ __ ]
prolific predator yeah the stories of
what that guy did it was really remark I
mean really astounding stuff actually
have some clips this one is really
incredible it's a clip of from his old
show The Cosby Show beloved by all where
he talks about he's doing a barbecue and
he's like and his wife was like isn't it
so nice how everyone's getting along
after their fighting and he goes hey
it's it's the secret is my barbecue
sauce she's like oh you're kidding he's
like oh dead serious and he like doesn't
smile his face is like deadpan he's
sinister sounding and he continues he
goes
oh no I'm dead serious you ever noticed
when you have my barbecue sauce that
everyone gets happier and gets a little
too fondly I'm dead serious and and he
continues and she goes stop it and and
and you almost feel like she's being
creeped out but I flew this she's like
stop it he's like no I'm serious
I've got the clip I'd like to show you
yeah let's watch it and then at the end
of the clip the kids are eating the
barbecue and he comes and takes it away
from them real fast implying that
they're that it is not a joke and so
here let me let me I mean this [ __ ] is
unbelievable it really is truly
something be Bill Cosby special Biba Q
saw so wonder if he was this is
definitely anecdotal from his real life
outside the show watch his face after
when it kicks in they get all she's like
Thunder hitter
I got a cup of it I said you see that
breathing right now oh my god what's
that isn't that [ __ ] insane weird I
mean wow how is that like family content
you know I think it was just like wacky
at the time but that the actual insignia
context well even the context at the
time is that he's put a drug in the bar
I mean there's no other way to they
haven't worked anything out for
themselves it's all my barbecue sauce
he's seen oh stop it
oh I'm stopping anything in fact I got a
big bucket of barbecue sauce in the room
are you coming up or do I have to force
you and so somebody of course I'm some
genius his name is yet God made a edit
that I'd like to share with you guys
that really captures the moment more
accurately I would say
it certainly is nice to see them work
things out for themselves pick up the
laugh track for them so it's frankly not
disturbing it's a threat
look how we look at his body like yeah
I've got a cup of it I saw this was a
scene for like a horror it worries like
a serial killer or something yeah I
would be surprised if I played this in
court during his trial yo we got a sound
bite the lawyer said like you know in
every joke there's a little bit of truth
right exactly yeah I think that's a good
legal argument yeah we got a sound bite
some of these barbecue sauce clips I
feel like these have perpetual use I
[Music]
love this barbecue sauce
[Music]
Laura we're I'm telling you that what is

yeah that's a man that knows how to saw
some pie all in the sauce for him till
now let's all give praise by the way to
Hannibal Buress whoo yeah whoo by the
way let's all remember that Hannibal did
this explosive standup several years ago
somebody just filmed it on our own
everything right
it wasn't on Comedy Central or anything
he was just at a nightclub and somebody
filmed it on the phone and put it online
and it made headlines because built
because Hannibal was like [ __ ] Bill
Cosby always tell him black people what
to do from like I from like up yeah Pat
is still always being like what black
people need the bootstrap themselves up
like me he's like he's a [ __ ] rapist
yeah that was the first time I I never I
didn't know though he was like seriously
go Google Bill Cosby Reagan's and see
what you find and that was the catalyst
that started this whole thing here let's
watch that that would also start me too
anyway probably I think I mean that was
really a prolific not prolific but it
was a monumental it may have yeah yeah
Hannibal
[Music]
you have a great women Gaza yeah that's
crazy that he broke that and a great
joke too but yeah shocking at the time
people of wives
well that's a ballsy claim to make about
anyone publicly to be like oh yeah but

a whole slew of juicy topics to get to
including greg paul the father of jake
and logan paul
has not only made a tape in which he is
having
how do i say this without getting in
trouble with youtube where
uh he's uh his genitals is going into a
female genitals
people have speculated that this tape
that it records his genitals going into
another person's genitals
sex tape you could say sex tape yeah sex
tape
right that's the i don't know um
he said people are speculating it's an
underage girl
there's no evidence of that at all why
is it still called a tape
it's not really a tape is it we need to
update that
yeah sex footage vid tape sounds a
little more like
hidden away though it's like oh i got
that tape in my closet but really it's
just
on your phone yeah so it's not that fun
anymore but sex tape it still is sex
debut uh post malone has apparently been
cursed i love this story that's great
and of course the hilarious hilarious
antics of reporters from the recent
hurricane
there's a new trend and not really a
neutron they've been doing it for ages
where they just stand
in hurricanes and it's hilarious
and i've put together a whole thing so
these are this this and so much more
welcome everybody to the h3 bug guest
beyond the experience
fully enlightened i am your host ethan
klein with the beautiful
talented lovely incredible loving
elo client thank you love of my life
beautiful wow so great to have you
well enough about uh ela let's get to
the
one person in the world who turns me on
even more
greg paul
now
okay so let's start from the top because
this is a whole story that's kind of
developed so
i want to explain to you guys from the
top what happened
okay now first of all i think the first
thing that happened and dan correct me
if i'm wrong on anything but i think
i've got my facts straight
is that logan paul's channel was hacked
and the attacker uh
uploaded a basically a fake
iphone giveaway which is honestly not
that much of a departure from his usual
content
so i'm surprised anyone even noticed
because they took it down really fast
click the link in the description to
claim your free iphone x giving away
1500 iphones apparently people were
clicking this link and just getting like
straight up key loggers and
viruses which is great you know all the
best stuff on the internet has to offer
so that got taken down pretty quickly
and um
on sunday the hackers released jake
paul's
calendar via their twitter page which
has since been banned
it included the address and contact info
for many celebrities including justin
bieber yikes
and what was thought this is a great
twist thought to be ethan
me of course that's me um when jake paul
was on our podcast
he saved dan's number because he had a
pre-show call with dan
yeah and he saved it as h3h3
so dan's phone number was leaked
over uh blowing up with phone calls yeah
that was fun
tell me about that dan um yeah it was uh
what
sunday afternoon um was just chilling at
home and all of a sudden get a call from
an unknown number oh that's
weird no i ignored it what kind of
maniac
answers unknown numbers in 2018 yeah
that's just
crazy absolutely um but as soon as it
ended uh another one and then another
one another one and
pretty quickly i was like okay something
something happened this is
this is not normal and uh yeah just
tracked it down and see the old jakey
poo
did you not answer one of the calls no
no
did you get any texts or anything yeah
text well again because they thought it
was you
so it's just all kinds of people saying
what's up ethan and like
what kinds of messages for you so
anything uh interesting
no no really nothing interesting at all
yeah
i mean these people it's like you get a
hold of a number of a famous person
they have no idea what to say yeah
they're just calling a call you know
i'll say
when my phone number got leaked
previously when we got hacked dealer
and they posted our phone number on
twitter and we were
we were pro i swear to god we're getting
like 100 calls a minute
our phone was actually it i can't i
couldn't access my phone because there
was just incoming calls non-stop so i
didn't like swipe it open yeah i
couldn't even do anything
but i was getting tons of text messages
and i don't think i actually ever
told you this but somebody sent me i
don't know why i even opened text
message because i was generally not
but one of them was a dick pic and i
have to tell you
really i did feel violated and in that
moment i had
a i had a moment of like empathy and
sympathy
for all the females out there getting
unsolicited dick pics because it felt
it felt very vi i felt very violated
that i saw this
man he was a fat man with a tiny small
penis it looked almost like my own if
i'm being honest a tiny little penis the
pubes were much longer than the penis
itself
and i was like whoa is that a picture i
took no it was someone sending me
their own so um
you think it was his picture and not
something off the internet no it was
definitely dude just snapped his junk
and
sent it to me yeah so there's a fat
chubby little penis so you were me too
i was me too i've i've been trying to
tell you that for a long time
trying to take back me too for us for me
meet anyway so apparently me third
apparently the hacker this this kind of
perplexes me this hacker got into jake
logan and their father's account all
three like
i mean these guys are big shots
they have run big companies how first of
all is their security
not tighter run third of all how do you
get into all three of them
at the same time what i was wondering is
are they still all on the same family
plan at verizon or some [ __ ]
you know what i mean like how do you
explain that they got all three of their
accounts yeah i don't know
fascinating stuff well regardless of how
it happened
um it could only happen to these
geniuses
um apparently so in jake's
dm's there's all kinds of uh stuff of
him flirting with girls
i don't know apparently they they teased
all kinds of stuff but they didn't show
anything so i don't know but definitely
the most [ __ ] up thing to come out of
it by far was um
the greg paul sex tape greg paul being
the father um
this guy is a piece of work man greg
paul is the guy who has
notoriously made out with little girls
in one of jake's videos
kissed kissed i mean there might have
been sorrows
and he seems he wears a p he's a he's 40
how old is he down he's like 45
54. yeah i think that's right i mean
here here's all you need to know about
the guy he's a 54 year old man with a
puka shell necklace and a goatee
i mean rules hit me with some of those
sound bites would you zack
gp coming at you gp is coming at you
that's his interests
he talks he like lowers his voice and
talks like uh it's like he's doing
anything
imitation of his sons yeah yeah
hey yo it's jp coming at you yo
what's going on
it sounds like he's auditioning for the
new blues clues opening
um anyway so so there was a sex
tape but there's no faces
there's some voices obviously the girl
herself there's no way of knowing
her age or identity which is good for
her thank god for that i mean
it's so graphic you guys i've watched a
lot of porn in my day a lot of porn
let me emphasize a lot of porn in my day
this is one of the most graphic things
i've ever seen in my life i mean it is
horrif i mean it was horrifying it's
really horrific
let me play you a little sound bite the
lovely thing was that it was just on
twitter and like
i just saw people talk about it
and going up the thread of a
conversation it's just there on twitter
yeah that's how i saw it first too
but i saw what i saw was like
him like fingering her but then i
doing my research i watched the whole
thing on one of these
uh you know websites
and it is so graphic bro there's one
scene where he's slapping her with his
ding i'm i'm gonna use i'm gonna use pc
words here because we
are family friendly show he uses his uh
carrot he he puts his carrot in her soil
but what happens is he's slapping her
slapping her peach with his carrot and
she starts to
water his carrot he she pees on his dick
i swear to god she pees on his dick and
this is the sound
that it makes this is the sound from the
video she pees on his dick i swear to
god
so he's slapping her and she's peeing on
his dick
do you think asmr people would love this
sound greg paul sex stick asmr that's
interesting let me try to experience
stuff that stays smart
i'm definitely getting the time i'm
feeling a tingle in my forehead
so this video is so
graphic um but again there's no
there's nothing identifying the man or
or the female
yeah so my first thought was like okay
this could be anyone let's let first of
all i want to see is this actually
greg paul not that i'm not willing to
believe it
i mean i'm very willing to believe it
but i just want to know
what's my hunch so here we've got some
evidence here
um let me see here
um you ready to come again
definitely sounds like hit me with the
hit me with that
coming at you you ready to come again
could be
what's going on people coming at you
well here we do a little csi photo
matching
and this is fairly conclusive in my
opinion
um here it's hard to tell okay but like
here's uh from his instagram his dog
sleeping on his bed
now what we're paying our attention to
is this floral
kind of pattern here in the woodwork and
you can tell
i know it's i know this doesn't look
that good okay it does not
but i'm telling you i've watched the
videos there's better screenshots
but it definitely it matches it's the
same headboard when
when it's in motion in the video yeah
it's a lot more evident that it's the
same thing
it's definitely the same so what do you
think is happening
but um i thought i had more evidence
than that
well let's leave that that's all the
evidence i've got
it's okay let me say this it's
definitely the same headboard
in your opinion and my humble alleged
opinion
it's not even an opinion it's an alleged
opinion
is that your opinion sir allegedly
um is she under age though i mean
who could ever say that that's dangerous
yeah i don't i don't want to
put out the guys having sex with
underage girls i would believe him he
was having
would i would it be a stretch of my
imagination
to think that greg was having sex with
energy girls no absolutely not videos of
him kissing
absolutely not um
but what about what
yeah the first thought i had was like
that's not you can't really use that as
evidence in court because it's illegally
obtained
yeah well regardless there's no evidence
this girl's underage at all so
um i don't want to insinuate that now
basically though greg
has acknowledged that the hack has
happened in this instagram video which i
will
play for you all here today
just a little something to tell you over
as i open this
by the way greg is a high level
instagram
user he starts the video with he got a
paper bag from like ralph's
supermarket and he just sharpied a
message so that this would be the
thumbnail
it's very creative i'm telling you he's
high level dude
he learned it from all the teenage girls
he [ __ ] allegedly
allegedly i don't even have an opinion i
have an alleged opinion
uh my hacker thought my hacker taught me
a lot
please contact me so i can hire you
bro you couldn't find a piece of paper
you really had to use a ralph's shopping
bag
all right let's watch this enjoy this
yo yo
she be here gp coming at you
you ready to come again you ready to
come again you ready to come again guys
gp coming at you all right so a lot of
you guys know that i was hacked by the
way this hacker dude is something else
man he is crazy smart
i learned a lot he sounds like such a
[ __ ] he sounds like he's 15 why does
he talk like that
he reminds me of the guy isn't there
character in like fast finds at
ridgemont high played by matthew
mcconnery
mcconaughey he's like a 30 year old that
hangs around
that's confused yeah what what is what's
that great line
he he has all right all right all right
oh there he is
had it ready to go he has a line he goes
i get older but they stay the same age
something that's what he loves about
high school girls is the line so he
pretty much is that character and really
from him um
you know hacking is actually an adult
way of bullying
what do you think about that i thought
that was kind of interesting hacking is
actually an adult way of bullying
is this him saying he thinks he's been
bullied right now
we need to call uh trump's wife see
where he's coming from
with that statement really it is a
little bit but
okay what do you think i don't know you
thought it was funny thing
he's being bullied poor guy and uh
you know i don't know why the guy does
it because he doesn't get any
real recognition for it uh he's not
really messing up my life that bad
because my life
my i'm just not that important but um
i learned a lot from him i learned about
some ways to prevent hacking and all
this stuff but dude if you're out there
i want you to reach out to me the guy
still has my aol
it makes it sound like his password was
like password
i learned a lot about security
greg paul rules he still has his aol
account oh i missed that
wait i can't remind you give back my aol
account including your information there
because i want to hire you
of course craig paul uses aol he wants
to hire the hacker
how about thrown into jail i think this
was probably an elaborate ruse too
to get them this was his mastermind
but you know greg paul probably still
has aol dial-up
on autopay you know what i mean i read i
read a stat that there's like a million
people still paying aol
on a dial-up like all these old people
that never upgraded their internet
they're all
like i bet you my grandparents he's like
94
still pays aol for dial up
we can use your smarts in in your skill
set in a positive way and probably make
you a [ __ ] ton of legit money
anyway i hope you guys have a great
weekend i hope you guys have a great day
and check these out
those were the two fingers gross i'm
just
telling you honestly he did this and boy
i saw those fingers
and a bucket of piss it goes
you ready to come again anyway i feel
bad for him hacking's no fun it is adult
bowling you're right
i feel bad in a way i hope that girl
wasn't underage all those hackers
just say such a nice adult bullying
oh so now you agree i agree i came
before i came around
it's adult bowling it's it is i don't
know it's it sucks it's the worst thing
to go through and it's like
yeah it's awful anyway my heart goes out
to greg paul
and um it gushes for him you might say
my heart gushes for him
one might say that and um i really hope
the girl was not under age
for for his sake for all of our sick for
the world's sake
please greg don't be [ __ ] underage
girls and recording it
because like we're the world is just not
ready for that
the polls aren't ready for that youtube
is not ready for that
greg please my heart gushes for you

that's crazy is that your have you
played that venue before yeah one other
time okay I forget one 2015 I played it
so now back and hopefully just as good
if not better than the last time how
does it feel cuz that there's like
almost 21,000 seats No how does it feel
playing to that many people verse like
200 people don't call me well it depends
on how you see it like so when I did it
I had the stage onto one side but now
this time I'm doing it in the round so
it's more seats I don't know how I don't
know how many it is but it's you know
what I did the first time was I ended up
you know cuz I'm a big zipline fan and
song remains the same you know that
concert film was shot there so I played
drums so me and the guys from the
goddamn Comedy Jam mhm
Josh Adam ours and all those guys Ben
Bailey came down my publicist played
drums we all just
and healthy arena just attempt on all
these that's Guns N'Roses and rock songs
that we grew up with and it was fun it
turned it into like sort of like it felt
like a more like a like a you know our
Clubhouse for the day
right and yeah you went in you made a
lot of noise and then it didn't just it
didn't seem as crazy
mm-hmm so I went out there and Paul
virzi opened and then Joe DeRosa was on
and Joe had this old sort of what I was
calling a Golden Girls sweater on so I
just made fun of that you know keep
going you know for Paul Rosie and Joe
DeRosa with his [ __ ] Golden Girls
sweater just made me feel like I was at
a comedy club you know and nervous first
shows like that still you know like I
get more like I want people to feel like
they got their money's worth like I want
people to leave like you feel like like
nervous this and all that is is on the
way up and then once you get to a
certain level then it becomes like
responsibility like you spent their
hard-earned money they're coming out
they had to get a sitter it's not like
they just went to a comedy club a let's
watch 10 comics and maybe a couple
drinks yeah I have a couple of yeah this
is like this is an event
so know how to pressure and that uh no I
mean I mean it's it would be a lot of
pressure if I had to do like math like
something I wasn't good at but it's like
this is what I do they're coming to see
me I mean you could do a podcast there
Nana you before well I guess you're not
in front of a crowd but whatever you
know what I mean if you went to whatever
comic-con the broadcasting would you be
nervous yes I'm so neurotic I am nervous
I'm nervous right now okay no trust me
I'm well I'm on edge was there a point
relax thank you
was there a point when you can't kind of
because certainly you felt nervousness
sometime oh no yeah the first years in
my career I mean I would be like I do a
10-minute spot and then on nights where
was a difficult crowd in New York I
would be out of breath and sweating
really
twelve minutes I was telling jokes I
would be sweaty so yeah no no no no I
had all these rituals I had this rule
for years where before I went on stage I
would untie and then retie my shoes cuz
I always worried what if they came
untied and I did a faceplant oh I have I
have that kind of CD [ __ ] drives me
crazy I don't know if that's OCD but
well I depends on what your childhood
was I mean if you had a childhood and
you weren't bullied at all and you still
think like that I would think it was
some sort of OCD but you know you got
kicked out of yourself for a while so
it's LCD you kind of look in this Oh
your Z I don't I'm not gonna diagnose
you I have no idea yeah
so in my case it was probably just you
know my childhood or whatever it's just
like oh you got bullied as a kid yeah oh
boy I did bully I you know it was a get
it off of me and I'd pick on somebody
weaker than me you know I was the Lord
of the Flies course back then so it
wasn't the way it is now where you know
you can go on YouTube and the next thing
you know the bullies crying for some
reason like do you think I feel like
bullies almost important in a way isn't
it like you gotta allow kids to give
each other [ __ ] in a sense I mean you
can't call it gets too much I don't
think it's a parent you ever allow it
sure you know it's it's something no but
I mean I know that there's like like I
have a daughter and I want her to take
some MMA and I just think all women
should know that because I feel like
rapists you know depending on how well
they're endowed at some point they're
gonna have to get in close and I feel
like no like one killer yeah I mean yeah
it's like I would think like when you
watch those women fight in the UFC it's
just like there's I mean there's
probably I mean I would do what I don't
what percentage of the population of
just guys that even know how to fight
fair could beat them and like I don't
think they could because and the second
you get close to these are the
professional level fighters so if the
average woman would learn that I mean
you could get them in a triangle yeah I
said the arm guard I'm trying to member
all the stuff Rogan says like I don't
matter I don't not educated in it but I
just know looking at it that you just
like learn a little self-defense
just some yeah well the fact that you
can be on your back and be in a powerful
position and I just figured like a guy's
gonna try to gorillas way in and try to
hold you down or whatever and then all
of a sudden he's you know he's tapping
out you blow out his elbow and that's an
erection killer right there you blow out
the elbow
I think that's slang for the armbar
although I do see yeah that's part of I
feel like that's a new thing you're
already worried about your daughter
being sexually assaulted you know how
old your dog I don't think that is I
think that's you you projecting your OCD
on me mm-hmm it's all weird you're
talking about you know you want your
your two-year-old daughter to get krav
maga so she could knife a do his neck
yeah but I mean that's like it's not
like you know that didn't accept our
didn't 2014 I mean like stuff like that
is about what it always happened and and
then also you know gives you like
confidence and it really is all you got
to do you know there was elementary
middle and then high school and you know
I feel like somewhere in junior high you
just had to have one fight and fight
back and then it was like prison and
everything I don't you know he's gonna
be a problem and then they would just
move on and the kids who never fought
back its they just have these horrible
experiences so I don't know I just you
know it's just one of those things you
know as a parent I guess what I meant is
like now that you're a parent you're
thinking about things differently
possibly with kids and with your
daughter I mean how is that changed I
would say I'm applying the things I
always thought about because for all
these years of not being a parent I
would watch parents you know dressing
their kids in certain ways and I would
just be like how do you not see that
that is that the [ __ ] that that kid's
gonna get it all right you know what I
mean and it's just like for the love of
God can you give them a fight or son of
a [ __ ] yeah so like yeah I I think you
when you grow up you become one you
either completely forget your childhood
or you have a pretty vivid memory of it
and I you know it's most most of my
channel is positive that's interesting
observation yeah I feel like I forgot
most of it that means it probably had a
decent one right are the good
forget no because I I had I had a
no-good in a but I don't know I don't I
don't know what the amount of
psychologist but I just think like the
people I talked to they either like
remember everything right or it's just
like dude that was a long time ago man
so I think if you don't remember and
then you have a kid you know I wouldn't
want I would rather be the kid of the
parent that remembers right so it's a
yeah how do you forget my mother said
the funniest actually was kind of
heartbreaking
she you know my daughter's only a year
and a half and she was going I just
really enjoy these first three four
years yeah she was really enjoying
before they go to school the other kids
ruin him saddest things you ever said
button and then I was thinking like why
did she think I was ruined and I
probably was on some level that's
interesting that she remembered that
after all these years well because I'm
home from school
yeah but she's gonna send your kids to
school with with people who have kids
that they're not actively involved in
their life
yeah and so then the kids acting out
there the kids on his way to becoming a
problem and then your kid sees that
behavior starts to mimic it like I you
know a lot of my friends obviously have
kids that are older and they just oh
yeah oh yeah like it's just kids that
are just you know the key is not to get
mad at the kid you got to get mad at the
parents if you ever want to punch the
kid you don't do that right don't pop
you can punch the parent punch the dog
I'll give you a t-shirt I just but yeah
I mean I say with dogs now because we
have a dog and we go to the dog park a
lot and things like that and like it's
always don't it's all about not always
but sometimes yeah sometimes I mean I
don't know because dogs I feel like
there's just pure sweet Souls for the
most part and they have to be [ __ ] up
kind of by the owner to be really
dangerous animal there's the dogs that
nature says no to but people say yes to
adorable and then you like the mother
just that this inherently knows that
there's something [ __ ] up with the dog
kicks it away and the things gonna
starve to death and that's too
heartbreaking as a human being in a dog
lover to watch so you give it the bottle
and like you know then one day you see
it's got one red eye
you got the Terminator are you talking
about like an adopted dog or like a
getting a puppy
cuz I feel like when you adopt a dog you
definitely throw the dice a little bit
you know I had a rescue dog
so that was yet a pitbull right that was
my experience yeah and we ended up
having to find her a new home and
fortunately it worked out but she was
human aggressive as they say I spent
thousands of dollars trainers and all
this type of thing I'm like my trainer
and it ended up taking her and it really
it has been like the challenge I think
of his dog wanna be the trainer adopted
the dog yeah took incredible yeah yeah
as he Tad's he managed to tame the
animal now he's been working with her
for two years and she's over the first
time in her life has another dog friend
ah but he was the one who said you know
this is one of these dogs nature's said
no to but people say yes he goes I'm
thinking that that's what it is but
she's an absolute she's one of those
people like if she was just abandoned
again and then came in here and then met
the three of us once she'd be all timid
and when she saw that we were cool and
we're gonna once you fed her and
protecting her
she loved you is she almost love too
hard right right so then and then she be
treating everybody else who came to me
yeah like they were an axe murderer and
we would just never I mean so I had all
these things I used to one of my buddies
uh
Forest we used to just go on hikes and
and it took forever and ever never never
never but he was really good with
animals and she ended up accepting him
and it was the longest you know and I
had to do all like come back to the
house and just just have him you know
stop at the gate and then it was a
little bit behind the gate and then up
to the front door and then and then
those all the him walking in first and
just any little thing could cause like a
setback and it was it was you know it
was emotionally draining yeah yeah so I
mean and she yeah she ended up biting
one of my friends I always keep thinking
that mom when she raced at him there was
a party I should have kicked it because
who said she was on like a hardwood
floor I want to knocked her down you
know wasn't hurt
no she barely because she hadn't done
that before so she did but but how it
works is at first they go to the feet
then they go higher in each time is they
build up and then it's fight and then
grab and and it just you know it's sort
of like an escalating like alcoholic I
mean I'm talking kind of you know I
don't really know a lot of this stuff
and there's be a bunch of people right
now saying okay I just talked about what
my experience that's saying I know
everything about dogs so but that's
that's kind of I was afraid to adopt
because you just never know what you're
gonna get and I people give a [ __ ]
because we bought we bought a dog we
wanted we wanted a purebred puppy or not
a pure bet but we really like the
Maltese in the your keys we just we have
a friend who had to multi so and we
really like them so we're like so wrong
to get a Falcon got a Falcon let's go
any Maltese I know there's no Maltese
just a little fluffy white dog oh it's a
little toy dog New York you watch yeah
that you can pet but we get so much [ __ ]
for having bought a dog but it's like
you know you throw the dice when you you
don't know what these dogs at the pound
have been through you know it's like I
mean we're supposed to do just puppy
mill ones these dogs need to be bought
somebody's got to take care of these
dogs I mean do you need to know what
you're doing when you can get a rescue
to train them right yeah for me for me
it's my first dog so I don't want to
gamble too much and but it's it's crazy
it feels like you like when you're
walking down the street with him before
back Oh why'd you get them and they like
that you didn't buy that dog you it's
like if you care that much sorry this is
something that bothers me if you care
that much about adopting dogs how can
you have a kid you got to adopt kid
right there's kids out there that need a
home how dare you have a kid yeah of
your own if you're not gonna adopt first
heard say margin is basically a puppy
mill yeah I'd agree with that thanks I
got I got this man my theory has been
that if I if I was in your situation I
would just annoy the [ __ ] out of people
I wouldn't have volunteer it I got it at
all yeah yeah purebred I mean yeah it
was like the least sickly looking one
yeah I figured I'd get that one yeah I
love it yeah you just steer into it
I love that honey that's why I was a
yeah I was over in France and like I'm
trying to learn how to speak French I
haven't yeah been bad with it but like
when I go over there you know if you
stink they just start speaking English
and I was just like well if I gotta
listen the English you listening to my
French right and I would just torture
them with it and I would not switch over
and I'd be like I speak English and it's
like I speak French okay this is the
situation way to do yeah well so am I
gonna because you know I lived in Israel
with ela for five years and I succumbed
because every time you know they're like
oh this idiot American I'm gonna speak
English to him and I succumbed
I didn't steer in I wish I steered it
you got it you got to get into the
comedy of it just yet what you remember
their own language it's really funny it
made me look at immigrants differently
like but I guess that immigrants it's
worse because they're actually staying
you know what I mean right I would be
like I would be like back then I'm gonna
be there for ten days I'm not trying to
get employed [ __ ] and I just have a good
time I know I had a great time a great
time doing that I need to get a shirt
that says I bought this dog yeah so you
probably never spent much time at a dog
park because there's a whole thing there
and but it sounds like your dog would
have just gone on a rampage there
probably she was alright initially but
then once she sort of bonded with us
then it became a problem so no we stayed
away from there and then then everybody
else who watches like the dog whisperer
in that and then they tried to be the
guy he's right mr. atlas up yeah
everybody know where so many see if you
would have stated that I did that for a
while like the magic was making that
noise and it's just like now this guy's
been does he even know anything I also
wonder does he just pretend like he
knows and then we believe him you know
what I mean I don't know I mean you
right you really you're people I mean
he's doing this I mean how much what
does that do well I I think the guy
knows what he's doing okay I mean he got
a TV show there's people he did buddy he
worked with a lot of famous people's
dogs know famous people got eaten by
dogs so I would say you know some level
I think that's yeah you're really
cynical guy man that is a lot for me to
say that
yeah but you're not you know what you're
not as gonna close people think I listen
your podcast a lot and you are you're a
very optimistic fair guy there's like a
real fairness behind everything you say
I am it's nice to be listened to
everyone I mean serious you know he's
the king a rage common no I think that's
because you know I used to be a redhead
you know before it left me but I still
have the red beard there's just
something about like you can sort of
openly say that redheads are the
children of Satan and that's that's
totally all good it's all good kick a
ginger day all that [ __ ] does that
bother you though like for real all the
day no it doesn't it just it's it's
freeing because then I don't have to
care about whatever you're crying about
particularly white women complaining
about how difficult it is to live in the
United States of America this is
hilarious right you know I mean I mean
look if you some hillbilly living in a
dirt trail then yeah okay hmm I would
feel bad for you but like other than
that you have a you have you know pretty
okay coming to you in five
four three two
welcome everybody to the h3 podcast
tuesday edition
otherwise known as

or
arguing with me that is not an option
don't close it because i do want you all
watching the numbers are important
but just know be forewarned you are
wrong
because this is the correct opinion zone
today's episode is sponsored by 23andme
quip and seek geek guess what's going
down a week from today
bill burr the living legend the titan of
comedy one of the greatest
comedians of all time he's gonna sit
right where ela is right now
that's good i'm [ __ ] terrified bill
burr is going to be here on tuesday also
important to note is that today is young
shredder's birthday he turned one years
old so
let's keep the round of applause going
glad
um we are going to be playing
everybody's favorite game know your meme
featuring the one and only
shoe nice that's right shoe nice is back
in a big way call us in at 808
hot meme that yes that is our real phone
number and yes we are taking calls there
808 hot meme ooh speaking of hot
i've been having diarrhea a lot of
diarrhea
labor day so hot well no the the poop is
hot like
parts yeah got it yeah why is diarrhea
hot by the way like
never had a chance to like cool you know
when you bake bread you're supposed to
let it cool
and like go room temp so that's what
diarrhea
is it's poop that never got to they
never got to go room temp
but that's why it's hot undercooked that
is the scientific
experience is what diarrhea is
i uh man happy labor day i hope you guys
all had a nice break
i had one too many hot dogs or something
because i've been having diarrhea since
4am
been really pooping my brains out what's
the deal with labor day by the way
the that freaking mailman's walking
around delivering mail yesterday
i'm like on labor day on labor day
federal
employees don't even get the damn day
off labor day what the hell
what are we celebrating if the mailman
can't go
you know take a seat that's weird i find
that really
very bizarre he just like decided to
work on his own
i don't think it works that way in the
federal government
i don't think you just pick up your mail
bag and just start passing out
you sure was a usps guy usps
because there's those amazon guys you
know what i'm not sure i didn't see him
there's probably an emergency
oh isaac well either way it's like you
know
late labor day the everyone who gets
labor day off for like white-collar
workers you know
the real people that need labor day off
are the ones that are like slaving away
at amazon and mcdonald's and all these
shitty jobs right
it's just so funny labor day has turned
into such a
stupid thing labor day was originally
made to celebrate unions and celebrate
like worker rights and [ __ ] and like
meanwhile you got the postman
and around envelopes but that's enough
about labor day
the real takeaway is that diarrhea is
under cooked poop that makes sense
um guys let's get started we got a lot
to talk about meme royale
is coming to fruition ksi versus logan
paul
everyone's saying oh that's the fight of
this year fight of the century not even
the fight of the year because we are in
the early stages
of organizing what is going to be known
forever as meme royale 2018 because this
my friends
is an annual event
we've got people that are in so far joey
salads
prank invasion shoe nice they're
bradberry
soflo all squaring off
hundred thousand dollars of prizes i
think the big
the big fight should be prank invasion
vs joey sauds
and then i think a great undercard would
be shoe nice for verse ethan bradberry
which would be the battle of madness
because they're both a little crazy
and i know shoe nice is like over the
hill so to speak
but he terrifies me and by the way he's
been working on he looks really good are
people going to place bats like sure why
not it's lost
i mean i'm not going to take bets but
somebody will
you know that's crazy i'm sure there'll
be a spread if we so guys
get excited memeroy l 2018 is
happening i want to see kobe person
getting
his hands dirty his face is too pretty
he would never jeopardize that
god kobe person who would you i would
like to see kobe versus like mo
because you know i was originally
that's a good match up i originally
wanted to pit ethan bradberry versus moe
bradberry like the
the boys yeah but i think i think ethan
would smash him
you can't contend with this the pure
madness that is behind his eyes
like you even see in their videos when
ethan's like
intimidating mo that's like damn he
would never have a chance so we'd have
to pit mo against
someone like dennis yeah that would be
pretty hot
super excited about that in fact guys uh
you may have been following the story as
it's been evolving here on this h3
podcast uh correct opinion
episode we've been having a little bit
of a altercation with prank invasion
who called me out to box me which was
the
you know i want to say how would you say
the
the breaking point for this meme royale
because prank invasion challenged me to
a battle and of course
that's not something that i'm interested
in doing seeing as that
i'm a pudgy little guy and prank
invasion
literally just got out of prison for
three years for some kind of sexual
crime
um that is not well it's literally well
i don't know what he i mean
no it's a it is a joke yeah that is it
is a joke what i'm saying
do i need to say that every time
maybe once guys i do not think i'm not
saying
that it's i wouldn't be surprised can i
say that if you went to prison for a
sexual crime
you can say that that's not that's not
definitely i wouldn't be surprised if
you're
i won't be surprised at all i'm
anticipating it um
so he he edited this footage together of
what i said last
episode and he said respect to h3h3
productions
for admitting he's scared takes a real
man to admit that
respect bro now send me your address to
the podcast and i'll actually play you a
quick game for a quick kiss
dude this guy wants to come
to our podcast i mean it's always so
demanding in his twitch
now quit playing i mean here's the thing
dude send me your address well i don't
know how he i don't know how he
yeah i'm scared of you i am scared of
you that's not like
that's not like unmanly to admit that
i'm scared of some unhinged psychopath
who's roided up and just got out of
prison for a sexual crime
like if you if you walked by some
unhinged lunatic with like a
hell's fire between his eyes under his
behind his eye
it's not crazy to be like yeah i'm
scared
scared of you dude um and not i mean and
and
it's because you're insane
you know let's get it straight then
you're not a man
you're not a man also like i'm not okay
well anyway let's just watch
his little edit here bro you look like
you disappeared for a year
and you were in prison and you've been
lifting weights that whole time
like the last video you made i was
scared i was scared i was scared i was
scared i was scared
this guy was in prison for a year bro
you literally
repeated me saying i was scared that you
were in prison for your first sexual
crime and we're lifting weights that
whole time
i am scared that you want to come to the
podcast and kiss me
i'm terrified of all these things and i
openly admit it if that makes me less of
a man
god bless okay
i wouldn't be surprised that all of that
guy went to prison for a sexual crime
within the next couple months
that's not defamation right i just want
people to know that this is a joke
because i could see some people start i
could see some rumors
starting to pile up that actually went
through the prison chris went to prison
for a sexual crime yeah
chris went to prison for a sexual crime
it's a joke he didn't but i wouldn't be
surprised that's all i'm saying
do you think i'm insane do you think
that's my skill that i would get in a
ring with you and fight you
i mean he his veins were like surging
like what did you do to be in prison for
the past two years to be there
he sees that as a compliment he's like
he thinks i'm so jacked he thinks i was
in prison for two years
well at any rate chris i would
definitely like to play you for a quick
game for a quick
kiss and i think that could be a special
segment at
meme royale 2018
quick game for a quick kiss bonus
edition
are you gonna play a rock paper scissors
can you imagine kissing chris his breath
is probably
so gross i bet you he has tonsil stones
i'm just worried about the noises more
than anything
a whole stain of people just listening
to him you think that i'm gonna make
that noise with them hilah
not you we should bring you know what
would be funny you know how you have
these ringside models at boxing matches
if we brought one of these girls to do a
quick game for a quick kiss with them
into the mic that'd be [ __ ] epic
either
seriously i'm down anyway
so yes i am scared of you good job
prank invasion you freaking sk you scare
the hell out of me
now interestingly joey salads is on the
phone
who was gonna who joey has challenged
prank invasion to a fight
i think it's gonna be a really good
fight
did brink frank invasion acknowledge
joey's
yes challenge it took some time it took
some finagling but we have actually
lined them up and i think this is
something that is going to happen
at first it was really hard to tell i i
had answered in response to this
fight joey sells my money's on salad all
day and the thought of you getting mommy
make out
date by a salad head keeps you up at
night
and then he said you want to put a
hundred thousand on it i said abso
[ __ ] lulu put 100 000 on it
goes to the winner winner takes all
those guys are gonna be out
for blood it's meme royale 2018.
where were you when the salads fell
now is this gonna be a real fighting
like or like fake fighting
what was this wwf yeah i don't know
pranks fake
fighting this i mean a hundred thousand
dollars is on the line to the winner
i'm not saying one is better than the
other like i mean
i'm not faking you want to fake it
i just can't believe like people will
actually hurt each other
well it's like logan ksi i mean they're
wearing gloves
yeah well this is this is when again
joey salad sent me this dm and i cleared
it with everybody to get the permission
to show this
so joey was trying to talk prank
invasion into having this fight and
again this is why
prank invasion scares the hell out of me
because this guy is so unhinged
that i wouldn't be surprised if he went
to prison for a sexual crime within the
next couple of months
joey said have you been training when i
had a box so anyway he says are you
going to do it prank invasion says
i'm thinking not boxing but mma
no gloves caged bear knuckle
fight we sign waivers and the fight
lasts until someone gets knocked out
unconscious
gives up or dies we'll need lawyers
like this guy is
i mean i can't tell if he's serious but
that sounds like the worst of us
absolutely joey said dude that's just
stupid
let's at least wear gloves i like how
joey's actually entertaining
is this not entertaining do you not
watch the h3 podcast live correct
opinion zone
for content just as this i asked who is
entertained right now
joey salads and pregnant bare knuckle
fight to the death
joey salads first prank invasion cage
fight
to the death we need lawyers and waivers
whoever thought we would get to this
point without all being said we've
talked enough about it let's see what
the salad man has to say about this
joey salad you are on the air and are
you scared like i am of prank invasion
i am i'm scared for his life really
because he's gonna have to sign a waiver
before the fight in case i accidentally
kill him
you think that you've got what it takes
to take out roid it out prank invasion
yeah i mean he's a little crazy a little
more than a little crazy but
now joey have you seen his physique in
his new videos he's clearly disappeared
and he's been lifting weights and he's
been getting a little crazy have you
seen this
i have seen it it's not right now it's
just it's
it's newbie games i mean he just started
working out
newbie games and um joey you had
mentioned to me
uh something about him wanting to fly
out and
fight you is this something that you
guys are going to be doing
off camera well and separate i don't
think so
it just sounds stupid he wants to
fight to the death i told him at least
let's do the boxing match first
and then fight today why does it want
someone to die
now what do you think now what's your
take on prank invasion joey do you
think he's being serious what has
happened because he's went from kissing
cuties on the boardwalk
to literally wanting to have a death
match what has happened in the world of
prank invasion joey can you tell us
you know what i i can't tell that i was
friends with him for like a week
like two years ago his friend's room for
a week and he seemed kind of normal
but then he was telling me uh that he uh
he suffered from low testosterone so he
needed to take testosterone
enhancement but i think he just started
taking those
and that might be making him lose his
damn mind because i know some people
they lose their minds when they start
taking like performance enhancing stuff
so so you're exactly dealing with so
it's possible that he turned up this
testosterone to
levels that are unstable
yes that's what i believe that is
fascinating now are you gonna be able to
contend with that massive overload of
male testosterone joey are you gonna
have to counteract
with your own testosterone or steroids
i've
i've got i've got my own testosterone
that
should be sufficient and um you had told
me an anecdote about how he has a secret
technique
that he did he beat up a bunch of dudes
on camera recently
but he didn't want to show you the video
do you have more information on that and
if you could stop washing dishes for a
moment that would be good for the show
you kept me on the line for 30 minutes i
started cooking so now i got to clean my
deal
can you hold off cooking the meal i mean
jesus come on man this is our moment
here we
we've we've prepared for this what are
you cooking joey what are you preparing
hopefully
i got a hard i got it's my protein meals
i'm already training i got like i'm
training in like an hour right now
are you doing meal prepping
yeah i got hard-boiled eggs i got uh
turkey patties all right as much as i'd
love to hear more i did ask but that's
enough of that
i've heard enough for your meal time
prep now tell me about this video that
prank invasion he says there's a secret
video of him
beating up several people by himself
now joey tell me about this video i
would give him a thousand dollars cash
if you would send it to me
because i don't think it exists because
you had asked him send me the video he
said i don't want you to see my secret
technique he said that verbatim
which made me think that it's kind of a
kissing prank thing of like
my secret technique yeah that's what it
kind of sounded like i think maybe what
he did was
he he uh tried to get into a fight with
someone and tried kissing them and then
they just ran away
very interesting theory that's the
technique
is there any other closing words any
words that you have for prank invasion
anything you would like to say
would you like to cast the gauntlet any
accusations any slander
about him being a sex uh criminal that's
been in prison for the last couple years
what would you like to add before we say
goodbye and let you cook your meal there
that you're so eager to cook
all i gotta say is if he bails out
i'm gonna be pissed and you're gonna be
[Music]
welcome everybody to the h3 podcast live
today's episode is sponsored by hinge
and hems thinking for them
today's guest is Tim Heidecker the
triple-threat I would even say musician
actor comedian in my humble opinion one
of the most influential comedians of our
generation can I say that yes the demon
I would say one of the most okay I can't
think of a more influential one off the
top of my head in my life but I can
definitely tell you on my part that I
wouldn't be in comedy today I think if
it wasn't for your this fine man's
influence though thank you to that
check out Tim's live tour on cinema live
check out Tim Heidecker and Greg
turkleton live go to Tim Heidecker
dot-com slash events for dates and
tickets all right well thanks for having
me very grateful and very own yeah I
know it's always tough to get through
that what do you think about that intro
was it too much it's very sarcastic I
assume not okay I know yeah okay good
[ __ ] [ __ ] already [ __ ] I'm trying to put
you at ease yeah I don't want this to be
uncomfortable I want this to be a
positive experience for you most
important okay thank you I well that's
I'm glad to hear that because I have to
admit that I was nervous I mean you sure
yes I was nervous but I'll tell you why
because I wasn't sure which Tim I was
gonna get I know you know what I mean
the real Tim or the interview Tim the
interview Tim it kind of makes like a
parody of how it goes but I feel like
I'm in a different place right now
really well if I do I sigh we have some
mutual friends and and I've you know I'm
interested to talk to you in a open and
frank manner thank you any kind of
aggression confusion well you said
you're in a different place what does
that mean well I mean I guess I've done
a fair amount of the kind of Kaufman
esque
interview uncomfortable right interviews
which are fun sometimes and funny
sometimes result in funny content
absolutely content death no I've enjoyed
watching them so I feel like I've done
that I've done enough of that where to
keep doing it sometimes becomes
redundant and I'm sure as much fun and
and now that that that maybe I've made
enough stuff that there is interesting
things to talk about maybe it's an
interesting experience to watch me talk
about things and more of a sincere
fashion is it is it harder for you to be
is it easier and a way to do interviews
under that Coffman ass kind of no it's
it's actually a little easier to do it
this way because I'm not worried about
being in a in a bit the whole time
but I will see I mean we'll check it out
see how this goes I think I have a
propensity to be amusing without being
confrontational yeah so but now we're
like very it's funny that we're
analyzing the style of interview we
haven't really talked at all no yeah
just start before play now that we got
that out of the way let me let me ask
you thanks for the coffee
yeah how is it and it's very good good
balance did they could hope it's black
so it's kinda hard to mess up when did
you start drinking black coffee was that
right away or did you wear your cream
first grade Wow yeah you were sipping
coffee first no I mean it's a very
boring question well you were getting
our seat in yeah we're getting we're
tipping our toes yeah you know you are
good yeah who has the braveness task I
think I did it's boring but I did drink
coffee in high school it's a diner level
you know going up cream and the sugar
yeah and then excuse me and then I
stopped for a long time after a very
like anxiety like I drank a lot of
coffee I just remember drinking a lot of
iced coffee one at a movie right friend
of mine and got the full panic caffeine
the panic like overnight
cocaine feeling and then stopped for a
long time but then like you know the
past I would say 15 years I drink coffee
in the morning but to get even to get
even more in the weeds and boring
first of all this an event tonight
so I usually can't drink coffee after
the afternoon you know after lunch sure
but now I tonight I'm gonna I'm gonna
let myself have some coffee so I could
talk very fast during this interview we
can get through it right and I could be
full of what do you have rain fires off
what do you have going on tonight I'm
doing a musical performance for Kevin
MacDonald's podcast about I do know that
show but I don't know them on on a name
basis
yeah are you gonna be drinking more
coffee this is the last cop I gotta come
down okay let me okay I would want to
ask you so I feel like myself
and many of my contemporaries are so
equally influenced by your work how old
are you I could turn into a CO interview
yeah because I don't know very much
about absolutely I know a little bit but
I don't know you'd the background yeah
sure so if I if I apologize because I
probably knows this yeah it's redundant
for them no it's all it's all it's well
I might just be curious cuz about my own
show please please ask away that is
totally fine but I'm 32 by 33 oh yeah
right so we're about 10 years apart
yeah I'm 42 so I would say well
basically people who were in college at
the time that Tim and Eric awesome show
great job you know that's when I
discover you guys and for me I
remembered the and I think a lot of
people do remember the exact moment when
they saw your show almost like on 9/11
almost in a weird it's like wow it was
that formative yeah it was that
formative huh Wow
so tell me about that um I was in
college three am playing World of
Warcraft and a little [ __ ] apartment
by myself and I just was head Adult Swim
on it was like some anime and then on
came Tim and Eric not Tom goes to the
mayor no I can't come came
some show and it was just the editing
the colors the sketches the surrealism
were you a fan of were you a comedy fan
before that yes will you let you like
what what would you be well risk I love
and I love Seinfeld to be frank I love
Seinfeld that's always been my my
favorite mm-hmm I love comedy but I
wasn't so much you know and deep right
but I'll tell you when I saw that and I
was like mind blown cuz I I didn't know
that you could kind of be funny in that
way
mm-hmm and it was done in a way that I
was like accessible to me in a way it
seemed like you could maybe do it yeah
and and it what Seinfeld didn't feel I
can never do that yeah I can never ever
do that no feels so far away yeah
although do you notice now if you watch
it on Hulu it it feels like it feels
like a set now it feels yeah like the
way they stretched it or the way they've
made like a I think the problem is that
all of our TVs are so good yeah you can
see like them walking down that Street
you're like too much detail now you like
Seinfeld you fan yeah absolutely
it's great I could watch that every
night yeah it's probably crazy so good
so basically when I saw that I knew in a
way that I was like oh man I would love
to work in comedy all that crazy like
this video game and you did like it yeah
yeah I put down the video game and I
told all my friends about it too I'll
say I was I was your how was your
messenger that was I was people always
told me is they say I was such a fan you
guys all my friends hated it no all my
friends loved it everyone I would always
find that where people with a low back
end oh my yeah you like that they're
loved to tell me like these backhanded
things I loved your show but my
boyfriend he he that's funny okay I
don't I don't need to know those that is
true I go my my friends a huge fan of
you yeah tell me about you
come on and about those times know that
was the time around when we met and I
was in Israel yes anything was here and
we were talking over Skype like every
day
and he would always try to send me your
guys's sketches and it wouldn't work in
Israel
blobby always like I want to see it I
want to see what you're talking about
like he couldn't stop talking about it
was forbidden fruit it was forbidden
fruit and I think we downloaded a bunch
of all I apologize for that I believe
they were pirated spreading the word you
don't care a bit torrenting everything
at that time that was yes rotted to
Israel and I remember sitting down your
sister and being like you got to watch
this brownie Mountain show and she liked
it everyone was loving it so I'm not one
of those guys but anyway to the question
there the course that is is that first
of all you probably hear that a lot from
people that you have influenced their
comedy how do you accept that level of
praise I mean do you do you accept that
you you know not really I mean not first
of all I think when when we talk about
our work I it is it is not just me it is
it's Eric its John's Christ well it's
Doug Luessenhop it's their whole it's a
collective of people that made that what
it was so I I'm okay it's not I don't
I'm not too you know
narcissistic about it that I'm so missus
all me I'm a part of it but yeah we had
may we so much of that period was making
stuff it's in such an insular way in
such a for ourselves that whether people
dug it or not was kind of not as
important to us right now and we prided
ourself on that that we were not doing
anything for fans
we were not fan friendly I'm not that we
I mean we we were very nice to our fans
I think and but we weren't trying to
please anyone but ourselves so I and
it's cool to have because I had that I
had the kids in the hall we were talking
before the show that I like something
like the kids in the hall we're totally
influential to me and certain like you
know Saturday Night Live and all those
and then you get to meet those people
sometimes in life and you get to share
that with them and it's nice it's
definitely nice I appreciate it yeah
I'm glad that those people are out there
I'm glad you're it you know usually
results in kind of decent people to
interesting I think so but III think
it's interesting what you said about
that you guys were making it for
yourselves because I definitely think
that shows that you almost didn't care
about how accessible it was anyone that
wasn't like initiated or I don't know
how to say but definitely part of what
was special about it to a dick in a
sense that it was very much your own
just really your guys's own thing yeah
we had our strong sense of what we
thought was funny and we felt like we
were delivering to each other that you
know we were making ourselves laugh and
and the stakes were so low I mean we
were on in the middle of the night and
we were given very little money
relatively to make something right and
so it just seemed like we were most of
the time learning on the on the job and
making stuff and if he's especially in
the first season you see stuff that was
shot like in the hallways and like out
in front of the office that was all like
probably a lot of that was like making a
first pass at something in it not
working and then going like well let's
just go outside and shoot something you
know so we were given just tremendous
kind of freedom to experiment and figure
it out what time did originally air on
Adult Swim it's like 12:30 or something
like that at 12:15 maybe it's like
really fun to tell your parents that you
have a I'm on TV on something called
Adult Swim which is what all time wasn't
it was a couple years yeah it had been
around for a few years but no nobody
nobody still knows what I mean yeah it's
like well Rick and more so a Comedy
Central like oh they don't even know the
network they saw yeah yeah yeah and it's
still like people the the funny thing
this year has been this free real estate
meme all we wanted to ask you about that
what happened I don't know I mean it
comes out of nowhere
yeah right it comes out of the reddit
Internet yeah and it doesn't it doesn't
have any connection to the work really
to the original piece or to who I am or
anything and so I had this
part in the ant-man movie and people on
the internet are like did you know the
guy from the free real estate you know
it's like that's so fun and people get
mad about that and so it's a weird thing
and then it's happened to Eric with the
universe thing and you know that's true
how does that matter how does that feel
almost to be like it's like appreciating
a piece without knowing the origin does
that bother you at all um it does a
little bit I think it certainly does but
also there's a resignation to not having
any control over that so it's become
yours you know it's whatever kind of
cool to own the other yeah it's it's
fine I mean I saw a [ __ ] free real
estate mural I love that sketch me too I
mean and like I remember writing it and
like it being such a simple stupid idea
knowing that you didn't have to do very
much to make it work and I want to ask
you about that specific sketch for them
I always wonder like worship as his
minds when you over hi I mean we just
get super are you serious no that's
always the no assumption I didn't assume
that I I did only think you can't be
that creative when you're no not like
that no I don't remember specifically
that idea where your head with that it's
really probably comes down to it's free
real estate let's do a commercial where
we're real you know probably seeing a
late nights I'm corny yeah some real
estate commercial and yeah making that
little turn and then knowing that we
could just go in front of a green screen
for a half hour and we would give it to
our boys and they would turned into as
the bug would say we give them you know
give him some [ __ ] to shine is that what
it feels like sometimes because I feel
like our styles similar yours obviously
being inspired from you but a lot of
times we'll go just [ __ ] around in front
of a camera mm-hmm and then it's like I
have no idea if that was any good or not
mm-hmm but I'm gonna sit and edit it for
a thousand years yeah that'll work out
hopefully yeah I think there we've
gotten more efficient with that
think and ours also our style or
interest in what we want to make has
changed a little bit so there's some
stuff we've done that's more conceived
and thought out and planned and then
that becomes pretty much what you
intended it like that time story yeah
yeah it's like only planned oh yeah it's
like not that different than the script
and great things happen in the Edit but
but then yeah there are certain lots of
great moments from awesome show that
we're just like I don't know if I can
put on some crazy wig and you know March
around and we'll figure something yeah
right the feet a little a few of those
moments for sure Bob there's this story
I'm not gonna make you tell it cuz I'm
sure you've told us so many times about
how you guys met Bob Odenkirk and you
kind of had would you call it your break
I mean absolutely yeah it was your brain
it was our big break oh just to
paraphrase you and Eric when in college
sent search for Bob Odenkirk
address send my VHS with some your
sketches over the Tom goes to Mara on
the VHS yes well the first little short
film Tom goes the mayor okay and voice
and an invoice EVD for the DVD changed
from VHS to DVD yeah but Bob loved that
he called you guys up and since then he
kind of mentored you and got your foot
in the door yes so I'm curious now that
story is somewhat famous I would say
apocryphal is that the word Dan can we
get a both yes we're good stuff of
legend
do you guys get a bunch of [ __ ] in the
mail we get a bunch of better call Saul
swag are there people who hear that
story and they're like you know what a
little bit yeah it is encouraged and and
certainly through social media Twitter
and Facebook there's more it's easier to
get it's very easy to get in touch with
Nats of it's very easy to get in touch
with that yeah and every once in a while
there's something that we see or and and
we also are in the this business of
making stuff our product
company makes stuff so we are actually
kind of on the talent scout mmm have you
know have you ever found talent in a
similar way that Bob found you guys well
Vic burger is a big one right and love
Vic and I was telling you earlier the
story with him where he was making fan
videos for on cinema and sending them in
and they're like these music videos he's
made that are really good songs and
funny videos just using our footage from
the show and he so he we were just
amused by that and we contacted him and
and had him make some other stuff and
that set him on of course I think gave
him the little confidence it's like I'll
use that one little like yeah yeah one
little boost no it's so true and now I
mean in today's today as you were
touching on it's like so easy to kind of
get a hold of people yeah
it's it's interesting that if you were
like determined and you're make
something good yeah you can get you can
get I'm gonna see it you can and but the
getting making something good is I think
the hard press the yeah the barrier
most people are reductive of other
people's work or they're not ready yet
or they don't have the resources they're
not good enough first or they I don't
know it's just I think it's it's good I
think that there's still a small you
know it's not a ton of overly incredibly
talented new voices still like gonna be
a small one kid out of a hundred that's
got like this new look at something but
but there's plenty of funny people
there's plenty of yeah you know
definitely good filmmakers and stuff
speaking of Bob he's gone on to like
this incredible success has it been
crazy to watch because yeah because
transformation from my comedian to
dramatic actors yeah really something
yeah I mean when we he was in a
transition period I think in his life
when we met him because he had come out
of doing a couple of pilots that didn't
go he was directing a couple movies and
I think he was not really sure what he
was going to be doing
and he was helping us and he was helping
a bunch of other people get started in
the business and and and yeah so I think
the he was I don't know I mean he's he's
got a good attitude about it I know that
I know he's like I'm just happy to have
the have cool work you know I get to do
cool work he's incredible I don't know
people don't even remember that he was a
comedian at this point cuz he's so the
breaking bad guy yeah so right but so
many lives because I was listening by
Dana Carvey was on Howard Stern there
was a replay but I was listening to it
and he was talking about Odenkirk
writing these iconic Saturday Night Live
sketches back in the Dana Carvey years
because he didn't know he was involved
in Odenkirk and Smigel and Conan O'Brien
we're all writing like the this Saturday
Night Live sketch that that got me into
comedy he was there so like he's had
these incredible you know several lives
in this business are you is that
something that kind of appeals to you
because I know you just got cast in the
new Jordan Peele movie which is awesome
you're super excited about you is that
something that you can see yourself kind
of doing is making a switch in a way to
[Music]

Papa John yeah let's let us Papa John is
having a meltdown
Papa John spent a little too much time
like I'm saying I like my pizza a little
you know overcooked but this pizzas this
beats is a little too overcooked yeah
you know check this out
so Papa John as you guys all know
they're late great Papa John who was
outed from Papa John there's a whole
there's like a whole kind of paradoxical
situation going on Papa John Papa John
is trying to kick Papa John out but how
can Papa John be Papa John without Papa
John so Papa John the company right is
trying to kick out Papa John the person
the Shatner but they are for the John
just change your name at that point your
Papa John the pizza you can't separate
the pizza from the man so they're trying
to distance themselves from here as much
as they removed his face from the
branding that was right that's what was
the final straw for Papa himself yeah
he's like you cannot take my face off
that pie box no because basically my
face looks like a pizza pie I've spent
so much time near a pizza oven and it's
a basically preview of what's gonna be
like when you open it but they're
they're saying we can't be dependent on
one person especially this person yeah
so he made this is I love this story
this is just so he made a website Papa
himself called st. papajohns.com I am
Papa John like a Spartacus you know that
I am Papa John he he acts like it's a
social movement where like everyone
[ __ ] cares so much about Papa John I
am Papa John we you shall not silence us
we are we are legion we are pizza so let
me read you some of the excerpts you
know how long do I feel their website
when you order beats how you can choose
the toppings and then it like Falls like
olives oh yeah all fine if it was here
still on this website you can still
order pieces for my save Papa John's
calm here you guys let me read this is
the the
his homepage so let me read an excerpt
here for you all here I built Papa
John's from the ground up and remain its
largest shareholder I love my company
its employees its franchisees its
customers they don't love you anymore
the board wants to silence me this is my
website and my way to talk to you
save Papa John's calm as I said in a
recent letter I miss you all very much
how the [ __ ] you could claim the mitt
your just your pizza CEO I miss you guys
all you fat butter loving sauced
gluttonous sons of [ __ ]
I love sometimes I'm at home and I
imagine sucking the butter garlic sauce
off your fingers I miss you all very
much more than words can express
sometimes sometimes garlic sometimes I
rub garlic sauce and use it as a
lubricant it reminds me of how much I
love you better times
Papa John's is our life's work and we
will all get through this together
somehow someway I can only imagine how
difficult this entire situation is on
you know he goes from I to we I filled
Papa John's and then he's like is our
life's work wait we will all get through
this
well imagine Papa John saying to just
some [ __ ] guy who orders pizza from
there at once a week I can only imagine
how difficult this entire situation is
on you I feel like you wrote this to you
right I think it wrote it to himself I'm
very sorry
that you all have to go through this
just know that I still finger my wife
with butter garlic sauce
Bowie's listening anything and Beau
don't even get me started about beau
that kidding right
I can only imagine how hard this has
been on beau we pack his lunch with
butter garlic sauce every day this is
this part is real know that in every
minute of every day you are in my
thoughts and my prayers who exactly
you're looking Rama clean dude occluded
in this website are links to recent
press releases news articles and recipes
to my world-famous garlic sauce which
also doubles as a really good sex
lubricant to remind you of the better
times
signed sincerely papa
butter garlic song Shatner Oh Elsa ro we
are getting the truth out there garlic
my Bart my butter garlic sauce was
invented as I tried to make my own sex
lubricant my wife tasted it accidentally
and said hey pretty good I was emotional
beautiful journey a roller coaster and
except for the sex stuff that is all
written you see that was very Germanic
Papa I mean I don't know in his mind he
really sees this as a big pizza war and
people are picking sides there he has a
lot of support I mean there's people
demonstrating outside the White House
right now free papa
in his mind Papa John and Papa John Papa
John's exist without Papa John know just
like when the Civil War happened a
country divided cannot stand as the
Abraham Lincoln famously said and I feel
that Papa John is kind of a pizza civil
rights leader in his own right called
award this is a hot war this is a hot
oven war a cheesy hot oven war about oh
this is just his life story he's
actually got all the legal papers
because he's suing Papa John it's like
dude y'all started a war with a [ __ ]
make sure he could finish it
he's got feed some money anyway I just
loved his little cover letter so pop I
wish you all the best in your fight
there's a standing invitation for Papa
to complete his case on our show we had
previously reached out and better times
and I have to say Papa passed yeah he
said I got Peyton Manning throwing
pizzas into the American living rooms of
everywhere now all the sudden who would
you have left Papa who D have left me
that's who it's time to come
on this show bring the butter garlic
sauce cuz we're gonna have a good
old-fashioned reach-around soggy pizza
anyone know what that is soggy it's a
soggy pizza when a pizza got saggy or is
this like a metaphor there's something
else
Papa knows um Alex Jones is in the news
again but this time you may not expect
why this or this story just cracked me
up I had to talk about this alright now

not et babe Marissa minx relieved of
[ __ ] hunger by stud that's how that is
of an event is Stan - with the sentence

babe Merc me relieved relieved of [ __ ]
hunger hmm I love the Alex Jones was
watching that he hasn't addressed it by
the way oh
I mean how what'd he say yes she was
relieved of her [ __ ] hunger to be fair
he may he may have addressed it but I
hunted really hard and this is such
outstanding news that if you if you
google anything related to this all
you're gonna find his articles about you
know was insatiable tea babe the
interesting thing about Alex Jones
watching a trans porn is that heat one
of his strikes that he got before the
closure of his channel was for he called
trans people mentally ill that's nice
he's like you may be mentally ill but
I'm I mean that doesn't mean I can't
beat off to it does that make him
mentally ill if he likes it I guess it
does I can't leave you what I said

funny so funny man mmm so relieved of
[ __ ] hunger next time you see Alex Jones
just remember that by stud nice little
story great little story wish we had
Alex Jones to call him you tell us about
mm-hmm 90 day fiancé
love the show we've talked about a lot
about this show not a 90 day fiancé
yeah and fisa and George the gold digger
yeah so in this story this this show is
just a gold mine yeah
90-day fiance eats well I thought this
show was like an old show but it's oh
man I mean it may have been around for I
don't know how long it's been around
just looks like it's from their night
days yeah yeah but it's still going III
got a set DVR to record this show
because it seems like gotta be one of
the more entertaining shows on TV so
this lady has married I believe in
African and she is in Africa visiting
the family now the family one of their
native dishes is snails and she's very
hesitant to eat the snails which makes
sense to me yeah be respectful in the
face of your fiance's family and you eat
the snails and you enjoy them right okay
she's you know she doesn't seem to be so
on has a problem eating food so she
doesn't seem necessarily that she should
have a problem putting it down but got a
little nice like tomato sauce in there a
little creamy okay native dish it's very
quiet is a quiet food energies I'm uh
I'm boosting it as much as possible
this is cellphone quality the if she
takes a little but I'm okay with it she
ripped half off and it's in her mouth
and she's saying kiss me my her fiance
kissed me and get it out of my mouth Oh
gross they're watching by the way you're
not slipping up so what are you they saw
that yeah so she basically said to her
fiance kiss me and let me spit it into
your mouth so that I don't have to chew
it anymore
that's not paying respect to anyone I
mean that's horrifying thing to witness
just spit it out on your plate and say
Amen name for me hey come here pretend
to kiss me I'll spit in your mouth
nobody will know they're all look
they're all the cameras airing right you
know it there's like three cameras
watching hey let's get let's get another
one of that a let's get a slow-mo if we
can point to five no I don't know no how
are you are we yeah man let's see let's
get it close look kiss me
she's like damn I only don't she's like
I only [ __ ] with butter garlic sauce say
Papa say Papa John calm won't this white
American
mmm this takes on a whole new vibe
I hear toaster comes into the past that
a romantic kiss if I've ever seen one
sucks it right out of her mouth and he
[ __ ] chews it to that goddamn MVP
that guy just saved the day
thank you Michael he's like man the
things I do for a green card mm-hmm
these relationships on these shows are
really all about getting a green card I
don't think any of these relations are
very genuine so it's really what's so
interesting about this show is like what
is this one person it's like we wanting
to thank right it's like one eligible
dateable person matched up with one
completely undoubtable person and then
you kind of just see how much that one
dateable person can endure for a green
card and I think that guy in this moment
reached his limit he did it no yeah he
did it damn very special stuff guys my
shows on fire today
are you saying that you wouldn't suck a
snail out of Elah smell I sucked I'd
suck garlic butter sauce out of your
mouth that I think I have in fact Ella

to watch this yeah yeah yeah yeah you
the first person I ever sent a special
to ever in my entire life yep by the way
that is scene right the machine it was
well it was must been three years ago
was it three years ago that's like one
year no no no it had to be love when you
were in here for oh when I did the
machine when I read the machine you had
to be excited me too
maybe two maybe two and a five ok this
marvelous man it was like 20 years ago
right yeah whose before the internet
that's what's really impressive and you
I was following you and I was little I
was like obsessed with you and then I
kept tweeting your videos and then you
were like hey thank you or whatever yeah
and I was like I was again you're like
you got any specials like let me send it
to you I'd never done that to anyone and
it's such an uncomfortable place to go
to to go like hey here's what I've been
working on yeah
tell me if you enjoy it and I was like
wait that was a big [ __ ] mistake I
should have let him found me online the
good stuff first and then I was like and
then you came back you're like that was
hilarious
hey la come do my podcast and I was like
oh my god I was like you come to LA on
the podcaster part is is that we had you
on yeah we had this one or probably the
best episode you were probably the first
guy here in this office we had just
about this studio we had just built this
big beautiful set we're like let's bring
Burton he's a honored guest such a great
I was flipping the tables I remember you
we were drunk we were I would have drunk
here and you said to me when you started
you go I don't really drink yeah we were
drunk by the first break it's like in 30
minutes we were drunk yeah I was
flipping the table but it was the best
episode I've ever said I can say that
without reserve because no one will ever
see it no one and it's such a shame
because it was lost to oblivion for
technical issues yeah because we were
new we didn't know we were doing and I'm
so so sorry did that happen yeah I am so
sorry but I will say we learned a lot of
things from that episode we learned a
lot from meeting you and having you on
and I want to list some of the things we
learned from you okay
yes first of all to your great credit we
it was like three hours of shooting and
you said you have to post the whole
thing unedited yeah that was like
November you were like I knew I think
you were cutting you were like all right
yeah and then I was like no no no just
roll this whole thing I can't believe we
were doing that we were thinking we were
thinking like YouTube video you were
definitely thinking YouTube video and
thinking like you're like we got to chop
it up and I was like no no no no and I
kept trying the beautiful stuff is the
in-between saying yeah it's like I love
my favorite part of podcasting is when
like something happens off mic and
you're listening and you're like but you
we were so obsessed with cutting it and
editing it down it's true that it loses
authenticity is the pop yeah and when
you're in the editing and you're trying
to edit down like a natural conversation
it's like maddening what do you you know
what I'm saying yeah you were right okay
and we always thought because we took us
a while to get there but we stopped
editing we said number two
I remember we don't get we get uber
blocks for all of our guests now
Oh oh my god I remember that so baby
you're like let I didn't at the time I
didn't even I understood there was a
burr but I didn't know anyone used
anything other than uber black and
you're like and I was like I'm gonna be
drinking I got an uber and you're like
no no I thing is that I didn't know that
there was another option so I was on the
other end but I remember we were when he
was trying to pick you up you couldn't
find you we were on the phone he didn't
speak English he's on the corner the big
guy he's got a beard I got I wouldn't
get in his backseat there were groceries
back there yeah so since that moment I
was again I want you to know we get
blacks for all of our guys and ever
since that day we've sprung for the
black I didn't and I like I like my
goobers just like I like my men
why excel blacks in exile so again
getting on it totally forgot about that
and so third and most importantly we
have not forgotten and I shall never
forget by far the most important as you
may now understand as I pull it up what
is this what is it oh I know what it is
immediately I know exactly what this is
quicksand porn yup
when we were having our last
conversation it's the one it really
sticks out as we were talking about all
the weird [ __ ] we find on YouTube
you're like I'm into this thing
quicksand and I was like whoa yeah what
is that
what's so and then well I'm so happy
that kind of we get a chance to redo
this because I got the opportunity to
look it up yeah now we can have a
pleasure I'm watching it together yeah
please let's think I know this one was
only like 30 out there how did you find
quicksand porn I don't think I think I
first heard about it on like a radio Lab
and they were like and they were talking
about quicksand porn and I was like
what's so interesting sure I used to
have a joke about like the premise was I
always thought by this age I would have
been trapped in quicksand a couple times
by now because growing up quick Sam was
like everywhere and now they're just to
put this out there there is a comedian
who has a joke like that I never really
told mine but I told it like but Ian
bagg was the only person ever heard it
Ian bagg hilarious comedian one time
said the best quicksand joke ever he
walked in and my hat was on the floor
and he walked anyone huh quicksand got
him huh is this a great that's pretty
yeah no but quicksand was in everything
I ever smart growing up Abbott Costello
every like every everything was
quicksand was always the damsel in
quicksand oh and I had an obsession with
this is a young man's fetish yeah no no
it's like you got to be like 45 okay I
explained because that was like how did
you come out like how do people come up
with that as you bring across no no no
it's based in like the same [ __ ] that
like there was a TV show called the
boogaloos when I was a kid and like
every episode they tied up the girl
so like that so I remember going to this
I was a dominatrix game for a day on
this old show I had and the conker no no
Herbert I don't hurt Bert and so I was a
dominatrix kept with this lady mistress
Isabella and she did a bunch of stuff to
me and at the end of the day I was like
I was like you know I got a balance with
you not a lot of it I didn't find sexy
at all but there was a couple things
where I found like really high schools
how are you at the time I must have been
like 30 maybe she was like check out
this video and it was all stuff dialed
into my site like the stuff that would
have been enough
formative yeah what was the stuff it was
like superwoman a poor outfit oh one
dude when I first saw Wonder Woman I
remember being a kid and I was like I
was like oh I'm straight like the other
day we were in uh we were in Hot Topic
my daughters were into that kind of like
anime stuff and there was a Wonder Woman
bathing suit right and I was like I was
like honey let's get this for you she
was like it's made for girls like I'm
aboard like a 48 you're a woman I'm
gonna look disgusting I was like you're
what I got let's do yeah but so yeah so
quicksand was like the thing and then I
watched the thing I listening on radar
but then I start going I can't be a real
thing it's gotta be a joke all right
and then I googled it one night and it
was just the it was like a weird like it
stopped I don't know it's just like was
something I was like that's kind of sexy
the point when the girl's boobs get to
the mud reminded me of like every time
the dams will we get to the mud and her
boobs would lift naturally you know as a
kid you be like oh my god just connected
with that though right yeah well okay so
the thing that really threw me off at
this is that like a lot of them the girl
it she like dies tenda day in like the
fetish like she straight up she just
disappears into the Oblivion and they
and they hold that shot for a while
don't worry do I go how long's she been
under yeah like and wait and like legit
like dude I've seen some really weird
ones like with it like these now that I
said it out loud what happens is all
these dudes that make them hit me up nah
I'm gonna check out my quicksand videos
oh you got hit up by those ain't
community oh quit by sinkers they're
called sinkers their anchors yeah
there's like a legit community Wow of
people they're all older gentleman good
thinking these days
yeah maybe today maybe we can change
that maybe we can introduce everyone I
want to keep infused some new blood into
this community it's it's like 20 years
olds going what the [ __ ] oh here we go
I've got a whole I mean I've got oh if
you have the good one oh sure I'll tell
you which ones are good I here
twenty-one minutes of it well here I'm
gonna skip forward sexy girl here she is
this was like oh man I don't know what
I'm uh that that top is troublingly low
for this family-friendly show
let's cut this was good actually this
one is quite graphic so I don't want to
get too she's in a bathing suit for
Christ's sake give me a break right I
mean what are we [ __ ] what is this
the Catholic Church look a bit I'm
trying to not show too much I want to
cut I want to cut to the money shot aka
when she dies wait I don't know is she
perishing this one this [ __ ] is so
bizarre this is so bizarre by the way
this you're like can you sit back I
can't either so so I don't think she
perishes in this one so let's look look
at this in the birds that's Christ is
real so here we go
so this is the one where they perish at
the end and these these are these are
the ones that I cherish here she is it
starts almost like a Thrasher Oh see
this is Rosie's walking through the
woods yeah you get the whole story
yeah are you out of your mind
you had two very good ways to walk
around that so there's one she likes in
this one she's actually like yeah I
think is gonna shoot she's going quick
where she's like I'm dying somebody help
me this is not a joke yeah she's like I
know you're there we go this is gonna
get really sex you know your hair back
there she
I can't see the frickin bar but I want
to find a money shot where she parachute
she's struggling man so here we go
looks a little bit like work Oh get your
dicks out everybody by the way this
isn't the part that turns me off I've
already stopped watching you gotta watch
that her breaking character and be like
Darrell for real funny anymore man
that's what really turns me on when it's
they instruct them to break the wall so
it looks like actually that yeah by the
way it should be noted she didn't even
take a breath now let's see oh yeah okay
what's crazy is that this got me into a
spiral a quick fan and there's a video
online of this I think he's like a
brittle British journalist out where
quicksand is out and like the aisles
like somewhere in the coast I'm real
yeah and he's like he's like alright so
the quick son he is pretty dangerous and
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna I'm gonna
demonstrate how you get in and out of
quicksand I've got all the safety guys
we're gonna be fine so first of all get
in your wig around a little bit alright
and then you go in a little lower while
this is happening quick is having a lot
quicker than I thought alright maybe
getting me out and they spend three
hours trying to get him out of quicks
you he is terrified anyone thinking how
high up does it go I can't I honestly
think it gets to his chest yeah but he
can't breathe and he's like having and
I'm watching this I'm watching it like
you know there's Russian kids that hang
off the side of a building
yeah I'm watching it like that going I'm
going
it's long usually by know he doesn't die
part of me is like holy I started doing
I started doing a solo podcast because
of videos like that where I do too I do
one with like yes like you or love but
the open tabs yeah open on it and I just
do other types of [ __ ] I like of like of
[ __ ] I'm interested in it's always flash
floods but like but like I that kind of
stuff blows my mind like when you find a
video like that you're like oh no I mean
I loved
open tabs by the way because I always
have like a million yeah yeah it's a fun
game that we used to play I used to play
with guys is like you'd go in and just
open your browser like this and go go
ahead ask me what I've been googling
just flip through and be like oh tell me
about Kevin and bean I go oh well beans
a guy that's you know you're not in
studio Oh tell me about Rich Eisen no
tell me about alright but yes so that's
the podcast but I love finding a good
video no III never imagined my and my
whole life that I and I've feel like
I've seen everything so I'm wondering do
you have any other strange bizarre
phenomenons that you're on to YouTube
right now that's really picking your
interest or your penis or though dude
I'm the cool one of the coolest things
I've seen in a while do you ever heard
back door back room casting couch that's
the porn porn ya got I saw one of the
outtakes where the girl says no and it
was so awesome
wait that's not that's the owner that's
not the point of that nothing happens
but it's so awesome are they like why
are you here is it for she just sits
down and he does his spiel this you've
heard the spiel so I'm not the director
myself personally I'm just a casting guy
I send this out to the producers they'll
hire you and they just want to make sure
you can perform a camera that you're
comfortable right okay yeah he's like so
what I'm gonna ask you to do is first
undress and then the best part of that
whole video series is that look on their
face where they're like okay what like
pay me now and he's like good and then
you see him on his heels like that's not
how it works
confident where the whole series is like
does it ever go anywhere no it's so
great you guys I was like more of though
you find that I just I think on YouTube
to put back room casting couch fail or
something fail oh it's on porn how
better not click yeah yeah Tony Robbins
I can watch any video he does because
he's a sociopath Tony Robbins freaks me
out
because on one hand like he I get it
yeah yeah I've heard him he's got like
this magic he's like he is a sociopath
he's got that cult charm
he's a beacon jump he could make you eat
poison apple sauce and catch a [ __ ]
comet behind the moon or whatever he
could do that a hundred percent right
he's got a arey he's got a video of him
showing off his house in Fiji right mmm
and he's showing it to the camera and
it's just like do you ever like the best
way to say this is like do you ever have
a friend who gets genital warts and
every conversation they have all they do
is kind of slide in statistics about how
common genital warts are just like you
know HPV is interesting I am yeah go to
the very end and watch the way he Mike's
going on I can't see it for some reason
I'm I'm not ready but you was covering
the let me try to address this okay what
he's right here - I'll tell you I can
he's basically saying he's got heart
he's a very integral part of this
community that's really his family they
call him big boss but this is what I
call them big boss that's fun but the
best part is he forces everyone to stop
what they're doing come out to the
driveway and sing a song to him and he
stands in the middle as they sing at him
and play the guitar and you look at some
guys like I gotta get back to cutting
trees ok Tony let's do this what just
play a little and you'll see them apples
though he's in great shape
by the way I'm am saying all this and I
understand that he's never sold himself
as anything other than what he is ok
yeah well being hypocritical is I mean
yeah we watched the documentary but and
what it's pretty incredible the thing is
like that there's a documentary on
Netflix about him that was a definite
puff piece but you can't help but aside
the insanity of it so as hard as they
try to make him look like a saint you
can tell how weird it is also oh he's
good right dipping pool outside his
house yeah yeah they've been pull he's
got a little he's got a little
trampoline that he hops on yeah he makes
the girl break up with her boyfriend on
the floor
now I was like dude that's the one I was
what's life gonna be like when she gets
out of here I'm like that Rolla and he
calls back he's like what the [ __ ] was
like sorry we're okay I just got peer
pressure doing it on live TV he's like
he does this [ __ ] where he looks pretty
broken afterwards like what's [ __ ]
that part [ __ ] me up oh that wasn't
cool Tony Robbins do it but it's like he
does this Ted wear a nightgown he's like
you know he's not good for you right
yeah so you're gonna call him right now
while everyone's watching the cameras on
you and tell him you don't love him and
you never and you never loved it yeah
that woman he doubt that for me I go if
I hears biggest problems like I know
self-help gurus like I know them and I
just go what what about the day before
you were so PO you ruined you were
looking for help like him I just know
they're walking paradox and you know
this guy is the most [ __ ] I mean if
this guy he's got a [ __ ] dungeon he's
got theirs
he has like nine different beds around
his house just keeps going this is my
outdoor bed where my beautiful wife and
I la tell me this is where we make love
passionately it doesn't have like
gigantis ism he's got like a he's got
like a disease that makes him like huge
and his voice crazy we couldn't kill him
if he was passed out in a hotel room
with bats okay not much bigger no no he
has gigantis ism I think so he's a
massive man yeah his teeth fit in his
mouth like you don't have like baby
teeth oh is that true think he has a
hormone thing there's something in this
you know he's in great shape he's got to
be on testosterone he's come to ask me
about my family and then I'm gonna reply
the way Tony Ryall and Bert tell me
about your family

from the top baby you know I was told I
was joking with ela yeah just a week ago
I said you know what is a funny joke
maybe to tweet ela with back to school a
kevlar backpack I was like hey get 50%
off your kevlar backpacks back to school
sale and it looks like tasteless don't
tweet it yeah I thought it's probably
too far I was like okay maybe you're
right maybe I'm just twisted sick
individual
guess what we saw where what what what
new station was the song here let me pop
this up Fox News Fox Business one of
those fox business are we separating
those others different singing yeah
that's pretty much the same thing well
anyway on fox news this is there's so
many layers of greatness to this this is
the goof of the day by the way if you
guys if we need to regiment it out there
you go so they're selling bulletproof
vests
a bulletproof backpack while playing
bulletproof the song sponsored by
Chrysler I was just gonna make a little
joke here they're selling it on the new
sponsor by Chrysler you know it's like
damn it's like Chrysler like the car
company yeah this all sponsored by car
Chrysler school shooting sponsored by
Chrysler yeah high-end bulletproof
backpacks and clothing revenge oh boy
just shoot her point-blank that'll
that'll that'll teach the kids how to
make sure their backpacks works and
remember kids if you want to insure that
your backpack is indeed bulletproof
bring a gun to school and shoot your
friend point-blank it is anticipated to
reach more than 5 billion oh they're
really projecting a lot by 2025 you
cannot project out what seven years in
seven years I'm projected to be the
President and see if that happens
so I thought this was just a goof I
thought this was a total blast so next
time you guys go to the Chrysler

savage by the way I have we were at his
birthday party and I was like man I want
to get him a sick birthday gift cuz he's
like such a good friend he bought you a
really beautiful gift on your birthday
mm-hmm he got ela like this Limited
Edition supreme Fender Strat guitar
there's only like 30 of them in the
world yeah I don't I don't have anything
that is so valuable
other than that I didn't know what to do
I don't know it's a new want to take it
on the wall but he just shows up he
shows up like a couple hours after he
shows up some dude shows up with a
guitar yeah and it was like this
incredible Fender Strat supreme
limited-edition and I was like oh wow
really cool guitar I didn't even
understand that he was giving it to you
I thought the guy just delivered it to
pulse and then he left I was like oh we
forgot his guitar hmm and he was like
it's for me
no I didn't get that but anyway I was
like damn how the [ __ ] do we top that so
well you can't so right you I can't
really but I was like how I gotta get
him a really nice gift so I got I went
down he's a
fanatic we've been to this gun store
together and I got him this cool little
snipey what you just linked me dad what
I think is the guitar that you're
talking about no let's show it we got
pictures on deck
yeah is this one did we are so
interactive we are so this is such an
experience that we can just talk about
something and show it to you at the same
time cutting-edge technology yeah this
is such an experience if only I could do
it with him pretty incredible stuff here
folks
party pretty incredible stuff here folks
okay I I'm still I don't know how do you
display it do you do you frame it cuz it
also comes in a nice box keep it in the
box
get out of the box you take it out of
the box I think you you mean there's
mounts for guitars I think I'm just like
a wall piece I don't think you I think
you just hang it mm-hmm but anyway I'm a
co-owner whose birthday ELA was gone so
I was kinda on my own by the way taking
care of myself which is hard enough as
it is and so I go to this gun shop I'm
like what can I do what can I get
post so he had ordered this this really
cool Glock from them and I was like I
want to get him something dope so I got
him just a little snipey cool asked
leiserson IP that you put on top of the
Glock right not the official name are
you just calling it an IP it's called a
snipe II know it's a it's a scope it's a
sick-ass scope by the way because you
only see it if you look through this
night be whole so if you got someone
locked on they don't see the laser right
here like in the movies only you see it
this might be dead right and I got him
like a thousand rounds I thought I was
feeling pretty good I had like two ammo
boxes a snipey a bunch of rounds and I
was like you know what's the thoughtful
gifts personal it's pretty weird to shop
in to a party where I know it was a big
party and I felt a little bit strange
filling up with ammo at that gun store I
was like are you sure this is okay it's
funny I actually went in there to buy
ammo weapon I was like I'm gonna buy him
a gun they're like - you can't like what
are you [ __ ] stupid you can't buy him
a gun and bring it to a party
how's like oh I guess that does make
sense I guess that's probably a good
thing I guess that's like the one thing
you can't do in America I was like
that's probably yeah that's probably a
good thing
it's funny on one hand I'm like here on
the show being like gun control yeah I'm
like can I buy a weapon and then on the
same day give it to somebody else
they're like no dude okay I guess that
makes sense anyway I bought him a bunch
of ammo a thousand rounds of sniper I
probably spent like $1,500 pretty good
for us yeah I was like damn I hooked him
I'm to do it up and then I calmed and I
was like hey man check out what I got
you and he was very gracious isn't about
post at all this is more a rant against
21 Savage because I had beef with that
guy he doesn't know it so I mean pulse
was very gracious very sweet as you know
he's a perfect angel probably the
closest thing to perfect human being and
then savage shows up and he gives him I
[ __ ] you not like five minutes later
$100,000 watch yeah and I'm like okay
mr. [ __ ] hip-hop you got to know my
broke ass up you know what kind of watch
was it you remember I don't know it but
it was like on the news and now it on
Twitter news where's my snipey in there
and now I see Austin walking around with
his sick ass hundred thousand dollar
watch I don't see him walking around
with this snipey look it's not about how
much the gift cost it's about the the
gesture in this case it was most
definitely about well he loved the watch
it was a great watch it was a great gift
I just honestly wish maybe you could
have waited and giving it to him before
the party you know like maybe a
different time Savage I mean it's kind
of rude to me personally and I do take
it as a kind of a problem
so if you see Savage let him know that
we do have beef don't let everyone know
about anyway congratulations to post
Malone and then
morning that happened last night and
this morning I see my brother-in-law
who's like somehow like we got to hire
my brother to do research this guy is
like in tune with the world yeah he
sends me a TMZ article it's like post
Malone's
airplane is stuck in the air the wheels
blew out when they take off by the way
what how the wheels should blow up when
you're taking off how's that a thing so
he's circling around doing an about to
do emergency landing there in the air
doing circles trying to burn up fuel to
reduce the weight so they can you know
land more safely and so anyway he landed
he is safe we're all very happy about
that we were watching live here in the
office he made this tweet I landed guys
thank you for your prayers cannot
believe how many people wish death on me
[ __ ] you but not today I can't believe
that when I read that I was like whoa I
didn't see anything I mean I wasn't
looking well yeah I wasn't leaving but
people are so insane be like imagine
he's on the airplane like super scared
and he's reading [ __ ] like I hope he
crashes and dies I'm like whoa y'all
[ __ ] me Jesus no I mean I would never
say that to anyone but if you said that
to him you need Jesus can you diagnose
that ELA why are people saying that to
him do they need Jesus or what are they
missing just knew their life okay yeah
so anyway love congratulations
appreciation to post Malone safe and
he's alive and he's looking good he's
got all this suits lately yeah I know
it's crazy
you look thin in that VMA video - yeah
it's a lot of weight I think he's losing
weight he's slamming he's jamming he's a
rock star love is us
now moving on to something more
interesting than that somebody emailed
over the past couple of days an email
that kind of stood out to me and shocked
me he said to me hey I've been listening
a lot to your conversation about wiping
and anal you know cleanliness and
hygiene
mmm-hmm and he says you know what I do
is I near my [ __ ]
I was like whoa there is a topical cream
that you apply to the hair and then you
and then basically it burns it off and
you just wipe it clean so this guy was
like I use sensitive Nair on my [ __ ]
ring and I wiped the Hara I was like
whoa
that is so insane and hilarious I think
I have to try it and I think you
shouldn't because this stuff is like you
could burn your skin I actually I didn't
know what it was I went on Amazon just
to check the reviews and like most of
the reviews our pictures of people who
got burned see any [ __ ] no [ __ ]
more resilient or less resilient right
no really cuz it touches [ __ ] I think
they know well I think that's part of
the charm is that to them first of all
this is very I mean in the pursuit of
knowledge this is like forbidden fruit
forbidden knowledge mm-hmm biblical and
the biblical or an omission it's more
important it's not just a mission this
is God's work you read the messenger if
you read the Bible the story of Adam and
Eve the Apple is the forbidden knowledge
people don't always talk about how they
wipe their ass and clean their ass and
these are important things that we need
to collectively share our knowledge so I
think of myself as kind of a trailblazer
of a kind of a Magellan mmm-hmm Columbus
I don't know I think he was someone who
explored okay I'm an explorer
I'm kind of a darling if you will I'm a
great thinker
they said Isaac Newton he Isaac Newton
said of himself I'm not a giant I just
stand on the shoulders of those before
me
mmm that's what I'm how is that related
because I'm not
swiping giant I I stand on the shoulders
of the wealth of knowledge of those who
have come before me nobody has dared in
the history of mankind as far as I can
tell to collect this knowledge and to
share it with the world this is
important stuff Fela mm-hmm so I think
the pursuit of the forbidden fruit and
the biblical tale of Adam and Eve
there is much the same and so I will
near my [ __ ] in Hebrew and there is
like something you put inside your ass
really when you do that on what is it
and let's say you need to take a pill
but through your ass like medicine
how'd you call a suppository yeah so
that's what that's called in there oh
that's so the first time you said it to
me I was like what do you mean mm-hmm
you good that's almost a sign from God I
mean Hebrew is God's language right so
NER in a way it was almost a Destiny the
destiny all use of NER was yeah so you
kind of supporting my my no no well I
think before not as we come in there my
[ __ ] for better or worse if it burns
if it cures I I mean I have never had a
wipe in recent memory that wasn't Harry
and I think that this could be a gun has
the Metamucil been helping you love it
mm-hmm it's not a cure-all like a lot of
people asking for updates on the meta
music's fiber supplement I've been
taking it to cuz it's so so just fiber
we should be good but like when I didn't
notice any difference in my really yeah
see the first time I took I swear to god
it was like Teflon : I just slid right
out yeah
but for me it's not the end-all
situation like Chris had mm-hmm III have
a hybrid situation I I'm using less baby
wipes but I'm still ending what suppose
well he takes more because there's these
huge pills and they say you have to take
lucky them and thinking whoa yeah
well I'm curious what are you guys you
know I I want not just the the great
thinkers who join us here today I'm
looking for the great thinkers out there

interesting wiping techniques there's a
lecture

ring today eight oh eight hot meme and

you just fail
I mean well frankly I mean look I don't
leave the house you don't have to go in
the Sun out here that's true I mean yeah
my roof that's the problem with LA you
go outside you die yeah you know or you
get stuck in traffic so by the way do
you live in Ireland or do you live in
the UK where do you live right now I've
lived in Ireland until last year and
then I moved to Brighton so I've been
living there for a year since May
that's where PewDiePie lives right yeah
you guys you guys hang out you guys
brothers yep hang out make out all the
time no it's weird cuz we we live in the
same town and he's like a 30-minute
drive for me
I almost never see each other thirty
minutes is like five minutes best
friends 30 minutes I'll talk to you
something yeah we see just like once a
month maybe yeah it's kind of like 30
minutes same time it's also like I'll
see you next year yeah yeah and then
I've been doing tour stuff and
everything and he has his own stuff
that's he's going on so we never like
find the right time why'd you move to
Brighton mmm I always kind of moves I've
wanted to move anyway and I thought well
I'm gonna move to LA that seems a bit
fairs yeah a lot going on there I've a
lot to figure out
mm-hmm I was like well I could have
moved to London but that's too hectic I
don't really like London to live I was
like oh Brighton I went to visit Felix
and fell in love with it seems like a
nice little spot yeah lovely out on the
beach nice and cozy the people there are
nice you go to the beach not really it's
not a real beach it's like a yeah you
never really have the weather well
Elliot kinda has the same problem it's
like come to LA for the beaches but
never go in it because of the water so
cold all the time have you been in the
beach here in LA no down off the beach
it yeah don't bother about it so far
away I don't want you don't worry about
it
don't leave the house don't go to the
beach Shelly's great yeah
it's lonely make a lot of friends what
brings you out to LA cuz you came out
here on an extended trip right like
you're out here for a couple months you
kind of escaping a little bit would you
say getting out here and kind of just
yeah hey my life you know a life yeah I
wanted to become a movie actor really
reach Hollywood no come on yeah that's
how long it takes yeah okay four years
I'll see you on TV somewhere I don't
know I kind of I've always wanted to
come for a while and every time I come
here like we've been trying to do this
for a long time I remember when you
started off you're like you should do it
yeah that was in town for like a week
and nothing ever lined up ever yeah yeah
so I was like come for a month or two I
have a visa for tour anyway one of them
and yeah abused that and stay here for a
while and hang out with friends for a
longer period of time and then it was
supposed to be until August and then
tour leaves in August and I was gonna go
back afterwards and then my visa got
extended so I can technically stay here
a lot longer so nice why not I don't
need to be back home and Brighton for
anything anytime soon
just hang out here and do cool stuff but
you know you were I mean you've been
talking a lot about being burned out and
taking a break from you yeah is that
kind of is coming out to LA almost like
therapeutic kind of get away from the
life back there yeah which was weird cuz
I said that I needed a break and I was
getting burned out and I just needed to
figure out what I wanted to do what it
was like Ellie is not the place to go
find yourself I disagree by the way
really
I feel like Ellie gets a bad rep yeah
Ellis is a huge metropolis one of the
biggest I mean per square you know miles
it's enormous
there's so many different communities in
different you can be and do whatever you
want here I why everyone has such a bad
perception of LA well anyway so but I
mean you are in a sense kind of I mean
you out here kind of just trying to
figure things out or is it more just you
know coincidental yeah what bit of both
yeah I was I've just got really
miserable doing the types of videos I
was doing after a while it's like a
whole month where I was like this is
crap yeah like I'm uploading [ __ ] just
for the sake of uploading and I was so
stringent on my schedule and I was so
proud of that schedule I was like I
don't want to break that well your fans
could they tell yeah so that was what
made me do it cuz they they started
being able to see it and I was like well
if I'm not enjoying it you're not
enjoying it what kind of comments would
they say where you're like oh [ __ ] like
maybe just like I didn't seem happy I
don't have the energy I normally had I
look sad I looked tired which I fully
agreed with I was and then it just came
to a point I was like okay yeah I need
tip and I was coming here anyway so I
was like okay Oh on the way to LA I'll
just take a week off I've never ever
taken any time off YouTube in the five
years I've been doing it so I was like
ok full break no YouTube no Twitter no
tumblr no Instagram no none of that
right and I decided to just spend a week
on my own and it was great
got here hung out with friends
completely changed my mind again yeah
you're feeling better
Oh 100% I'm completely 180 done where I
was you feeling like motivated to but
are you are you afraid like if you get
back into it you almost fall back into
it cuz that was my problem was like I've
been through that same exactly I mean I
don't have a crazy upload schedule like
you were I mean you were doing two
videos the day for a long time five
years but then you want you started
doing one
a day and recently uh yeah well whenever
I'd have to go out and tour or something
I okay I bump it down but it was still
like still we're still worrying I
remember seeing you in New York
mmm cups couple years ago a 16 year it
was a long-ass time ago and and you and
Felix and Mark were there yeah
and I was like you're like oh yeah we
all made videos and we're ahead of time
and they're all scheduled to upload I
was like what I mean that's just [ __ ]
that's just twisted like there's
something [ __ ] up about this job in
particular yeah right I mean to be fair
my stuff is a lot easier to do than the
ones you did yeah but still let's I mean
you're still making two videos a day
okay again and you're still under the
same expectation your fans have
expectation you're the expectation of
yourself I mean our approach is
different but the consumption of time
and expectation is the same yeah I think
that's fair but like this job seems
particularly [ __ ] up yeah right like
what is it about because everyone's
talking about this thing of like burnout
right youtuber burnout yeah it's really
big right now everyone so we're we
haven't posted video we're ending on
yeah we're in the middle of burnout I
would say bro I'm fully burnt out like
there's no wax left in the camera I'm
new camera I'm taking out a new candle I
don't know what's that Kendall smell
like lavender jasmine no
lavenders flowing yeah I need a new
essence what's going on why why is being
a youtuber so [ __ ] up
we're all Psychopaths I don't know
really I think it's good well you
started because you love it and then it
becomes your job and then you have an
audience and people to take care of and
you want to do the best you can and it's
just a platform and a job that you
you're not really allowed take time well
allow it you can do whatever the [ __ ]
you want right but it's just not in your
best interest to do it and no one's you
don't you're your own boss you make your
own hours you make your own schedules
and that's the curse I think yeah and
now it's just YouTube's just in such a
weird place anyway with all the [ __ ]
that's been happening over the last year
or two years and now they're trying to
diversify their revenue
streams and everything so everyone just
feels like on that treadmill more than
ever I think right and then it's just
coming to a head and then one person
talks about it what spurns another
person to talk about and then ten other
people start talking about it yeah I
know everyone's able to talk about I
think part of the problems I think
everything you said is exactly right
isn't like when you're your own boss and
when you're involved is something as I
mean I want to say talk super that's not
specific it's just so like you're on the
treadmill you're on there in the hamster
wheel and it's just like you got to keep
the Machine rolling and the mentalities
on YouTube have changed a lot over the
years like three years ago the gaming
scene was all collaborative all the time
it was in your best interest to collab
with people and like beauty gurus and
everybody would be doing it and now no
one doesn't because everyone's afraid of
stepping on each other's toes everyone
wants to insulate their own brand and
build it as far as they can and
everything it's very our self involved
so one thing I was gonna say is that I
think now it's more competitive hmm cuz
bat-like I mean if you ask average
ten-year-old what their dream job is
everyone wants to be a youtuber yeah and
it's like so competitive and it's so
hard to become to you know earn a living
on YouTube I'm a big youtuber that I
think that's part of what's so toxic
yeah about what it's becoming you're
definitely right I mean it's just not
and we can all see each other's we can
see what each other makes but if you
make a certain amount of views like
somebody else you kind of know what
everybody's making so every youtuber
kind of knows but if your subs you can
see your views you can see your like
yeah how interested people are the
comments are everybody's just like well
mine's better than yours
mm-hm and then if your yours isn't
better than then then you do some weird
[ __ ] to try and get it to be better than
somebody else it's a lot of like it's
not it's not friendly rivalry anymore I
don't think there's no case if somebody
uploads something you think it's cool so
you like want to do better now it's a
case of like I can [ __ ] do better
than that and you try and [ __ ] all over
somebody else that's that that's what I
feel like YouTube at large is now
everyone's trying to be better than each
other in that way I guess whatever came
became popular you're like I swear I
feel like I in some way had played a
role now I do though because like I feel
like when we first started coming up
popular on YouTube it was from reaction
videos
and like [ __ ] on people just like I
mean you know choose your target wisely
but like you you bait I mean our early
videos were just really [ __ ] on
people I mean and I think that all we
did commemorate what people - no I know
but like I don't I'm not gonna say that
I'm like holy responsible for like this
trend of like commentary channels which
are basically just solely almost talking
[ __ ] another creator yeah
but like it's definitely a fad that came
up around the time we started doing it
yeah well we helped popularize it I can
say that well that's what I'm saying
like you guys start it off and you
whatever way you perceive it but you've
picked your targets properly you pick
people that you felt like were valid in
criticism you're not [ __ ] on someone
that's just the entertainment factor of
it it's like it's a bit more embellished
and it would be but then like I said
somebody else sees that and they want to
do something better and they want to do
something crazier and get more views
than you so then they end up just
[ __ ] on people yeah and then it
becomes a thing it's like like like
there's like see I see this a lot where
it's just really popular content on
YouTube right now is like it's easy to
[ __ ] on someone who's being you know
being creative mm-hmm and maybe it's not
your style maybe it's not a video like
and so it's so it's so easy and people
do this and people love watching it of
being like this person's not funny yeah
and it's like well they're making
something original and you're just
[ __ ] [ __ ] on them for that yeah I
don't know maybe I'm just my mentality
is changing but I see that a lot on
YouTube and it's like you the people who
are trying to be creative actually put
themselves out there it's so scary to
put yourself out there on YouTube these
days and be authentic and try to be
creative in the original because there's
so many [ __ ] and there's so many people
waiting to just eat you alive yeah as
that you're not doing anything wrong you
might be unfunny in my opinion but like
what do I have to fleece you're trying
yeah I'm gonna [ __ ] on you for being
unfunny yeah cuz the YouTube audiences
have just changed now it's like they all
do that now
it's very rare to have a community where
everyone's actually positive all the
time because right you're not you're not
an up-and-comer anymore it's not a new
job to do anymore you're not like the
underdog anymore everywhere there's more
money involved in YouTube now than there
ever husband and I think the audience
were very keenly
we're of that and that they want to poke
at people because they feel like it's
easier to do it's like well they have
money it doesn't matter if I say this
[ __ ] to them yeah well we're still
people at the end of the day so I have I
mean that's definitely a big part of it
I think yeah
it's just a whole bunch of building
blocks that makes a difference to on the
burn out because yeah you everybody even
the people who talk [ __ ] on say like oh
this one's not funny that's all their
videos they're gonna be more stressed
out because they're afraid that their
[ __ ] coat they're you know colleagues
are gonna call them out for [ __ ] up
and everybody's walking on eggshells
yeah because it's just like a giant mud
slinging contest these days on yeah I
mean we went through a huge varied of
like drama and community and reactions
and everything like that circle just
went around and around for like a whole
year yeah and then I think that just
fundamentally changed everything after
that row it's like communist Russia get
dragged down as the middle of the night
it's human nature everyone wants to take
down somebody else everyone wants to
find the thing it's like I'm positive
and energetic all the time but so people
think I have like some weird seedy
underbelly like I have like a weird pedo
ring or something that I'm keeping
secret that they're like somebody's
waiting to find it out well that would
explain why you're so energetic and
happy yes that's why I played happy
wheels all those years whatever everyone
just [ __ ] waiting to find that thing
about yeah I mean you get [ __ ] on
YouTube right I mean a lot of I think
people love or hate you right would you
agree with that yeah why do people like
what is it do you think that people hate
about you I don't know it's cuz it's
whenever you watch my content I'm
obviously very boisterous and very loud
and very energetic but some people
either see that as genuine interests and
energy and enthusiasm but to another
person it's completely obnoxious and
that's like I completely understand that
there's if I watched it I'd probably
have some sort of like thought process
going on it is very yeah I mean I don't
I don't hate anybody who doesn't like
what I do was fine does the hate bother
you does ever get to you it used to
because I I'm personally once it's like
make sure everybody's okay everyone's
having a good time and I just wanted
everybody to like have fun and then when
somebody doesn't have fun you feel like
it's your responsibility to make them
have
at this point I'm like okay you can't
win everybody yeah I'll just be happy I
mean there's still 20 million people on
the channel that's a very very much yeah
you can't really say [ __ ] at certain
point when you have 20 million
subscribers yeah I'm not any sort of
like egotistical way but it's like
clearly I've done something wrong some
people have exactly some an
understatement yes I was like how feed
into that positive aspect of the
community rather than worrying about
what everybody else is going to say do
you ever feel like you don't get enough
credit in a way and let me let me
explain because a lot of times like
people like you and Mark computed by who
play people would say oh you just play
video games and and you're so and you
have so many so much you make so much
money and you have so many people who
love you and watch you all you do is
play video games but clearly there's
some more going on that you feel like
you don't get enough credit when people
say that to you yeah I'd say so I'd say
that's fair because it's what are they
missing it's it's the whole aspect
outside of what you record yeah like
recording a game sure day after day
that's an easy kind of thing to do you
sit down you turn on the camera you
record but you have to find the games
you have to find stuff that people want
to see when it's daily everything like
fluctuates so much and you have to like
be always kind of there for your
audience and I'm very heavily involved
in my audience and interacting with them
so it's like after the video goes up
it's like well now I'm on social media
and I'm interacting with people and I'm
making sure everyone's okay and I'm
reblogging fanart I'm like tweeting out
at people and everything so it's it's a
whole lot more than just sitting down
recording the video and you see a 20
minute video like when I was recording I
was it's obnoticus it was like like
[Music]

did you say the link though because it's
representative.com h3h3
we had it on the screen as well okay
this one this is what all the sponsors
make you do they go
r r e p s r e s
e n t dot com you just may spell yeah i
don't know
yeah i don't know how to spell
represent.gov
slash h3 twice
just look what's on the screen i don't
know what i'm doing
um let me ask you this ela
what when you give somebody food you
feed them
right but when you give somebody water
what is that verb called you will water
them
there's no word for that is there what
is the word for when you give somebody
water when you
give them a drink not feed could you say
feed them water no you drink them
there's no word how is there no word for
that
quench you don't watch
i quenched him no you water flowers
right
yeah but you don't want that doesn't
mean this like this has been really
troubling me this week
people say ethan you've got serious
troubles people say
ethan you haven't been posting videos
and disappeared what the hell have you
been traveling here i haven't been able
to get over the fact
this whole week that there's no word for
the word to drink to give somebody water
in the english language we have we're
celebrated for having hundreds of
thousands
by far the most words of any language
that ever existed english language no
word for giving water
anybody in the chat gotta answer there's
no chat there's no chat
that's true i don't think there's a i
don't think it exists
to drink so that's been really
driving keep it me up at night frankly
speaking
maybe in the comments you guys will
figure it out
but guys i googled it and for a baby you
suckle them
yeah that's something that only applies
that sounds right oh uh yeah my friend
was thirsty so i
suckled in some of my water i think that
that sounds like it was like hey buddy
here
ethan is suckling the microphone for our
audio just so you know
no you've got a word for thirst i'm
thirsty
so what happens when somebody's thirsty
and you give them something
there's no word you suckle there's no
freaking word
how is there no word for that you
is that mind bending
like and and i've gone my whole life too
until this week without realizing that
that's what's weird too
this person is saying i would go with
hydrate
get get real you know what can i have
some water
yeah here dehydrated let me hydrate you
no that's not
right feed i fed him
[Laughter]
there's no freaking word um
for some reason you would say water the
horse water the horse or water the
flower but
it's not for people you could water a
horse apparently you could say feeding
and watering the horses
so you could water the i mean it's a
little confusing let me be honest
half of me expects that somebody's just
gonna say it and i'm like oh of course
yeah uh you tinkle oh yeah have a tinkle
like oh obviously no there's no freaking
word
so i'm i'm looking to this ongoing
debate
i bet you wish there was a chat right
now yeah it would be nice
can we invent a word like what works
with fed
feed and i drink i drank them some water
that sounds weird
feeding schmeed schmeed hey little
schmeed
so anyway let's get on with it all right
i got a good one actually i've never
heard of this word before
apparently this is a thing to slake
someone
okay like a lake hey dan get the frick
out of town
nobody's liking nobody on this show all
right this is a family show dan
um slake that's a new one to me i don't
know
so guys we've got a lot to get to today
oh my god we've got alex jones banned
from every social media
i got some thoughts about that i think
you guys might enjoy listening to or not
it's one of the things when you express
your opinion about something like that
it's like
i liked you i followed you for years up
until this very moment when our opinions
diverged on this one thing
and now i'm going to stalk you and
threaten your family
it's just an opinion folks you might
disagree with it
but it's just my opinion it's not a
right opinion so that's coming up
very excited about that ajit pai is back
in the news
i'm excited to talk about the fact that
me and el are trying to have kids and i
went to a fertile
fertility clinic and scored it in a cup
to analyze my semen
and it was a freaking weird and wild
experience that i can't wait i took
pictures i can't wait to share with you
all no it was something else man
and a lot of other really exciting
headlines i think you guys are going to
love there was apparently in louisiana
we'll save it i'll save it i'll save it
my dudes i'm gonna save it all
but before we get into all of that it's
the goof of the day
what do we got let's break the ice does
the goof of the day work ela
let's break the ice let's see hey
definitely
pierce morgan tries to sound smart
on good morning britain i haven't seen
this one
her forehead's really glowing huh damn
her forehead's very small there's makeup
that is
for glow like you should think she's
trying to be reflective you put it in
here
and it's like glow but that's not a good
look it just looks like she's got a
greasy ass for it i mean
i'm not trying to make fun i shouldn't
make fun of her i'm just saying
i'm just saying it could be that she was
going for that
there is makeup for that i i'm just
saying if you put her at the top of a
light tower and spun her ass around you
could probably navigate some ships home
you know no no
no no no no no no no crickets really
i thought it was right not that bad
yeah so anyway
a brief history of time it's that
history definitely so just avoid those
types yep to treat a girl right
hey have you ever read the brief history
of time by professor stephen
a brief history of time it's that
history so study into black holes
um
to the nearest five decimal places do
you
first what's your favorite color do you
this is like
i'm i'm embodied by so much cringe that
he's trying to like make her look stupid
what did they ask i didn't understand
that have you ever written
a brief history of time by professor
stephen hawking
oh like trying to see like oh you're
dumb
i don't think this girl ever tried to
sound smart i don't think she ever
presumed to be smart
and then so the genius piers morgan
imagine being a grown man dude
and trying to humiliate some girl who's
obviously not the brightest
but she's not out here being like
she's trying to give a phd dissertation
you know
she's dumb and she knows it he's like
have you ever read this book by
professor stephen hawking i mean i
haven't sir yeah who has except [ __ ]
nerds
but like
um she's not up there trying to be smart
dude what are you trying to disprove she
knows she's dumb she's like no i'm not
into that stuff i'm an idiot you know
that
like what's your point and then the best
part is this he exposes himself
to be the real turd sandwich
let's see it you know that the chris
theorem to this
3.147 there's certainly the first four
digits
here's the best part first of all he
names the digits for something entirely
else it's pi and
he gets it wrong nice i don't know that
that's just what they said
that's pine or pythagoras and you knew
that didn't you haley it was wrong
or maybe i've written it but like a
normal person would wouldn't
know that pierce yeah dip
yeah you just showed yourself up yeah
are you humiliated i've
i don't even know how you get back on
the tv after that humiliation
but um so that's a bit of a goof of a
day what were you saying dan ian has an
answer about the drink
situation no i just typed that when you
said only nerds have read that book
ian's like
all right i'm kidding i i i thought
about i thought about picking that book
up
i'm sorry and anne's like [ __ ]
damn ian do you know the pie to the uh
fifth
digit uh no
[ __ ] idiot what a [ __ ] you idiot
uh what else we have one other
announcement good for the day yoko ono
the legendary
uh lover a soulmate of the great john
artist artist yeah don't i don't mean to
discount her she's done so much more
than just be the
soul mate of john of john lennon so
she's come
out with a new album and she released a
new single
that i thought was uh provocative
emotional um incredible moving
moving it's called warzone anyway guys
as i said
pre-orders are available now great while
supplies last
[Laughter]
is it bad to make fun of somebody for
their artistic i'm not i'm not making
fun i'm a doorstep
you're promoting an independent artist
dude i'm promoting it and thank you for
doing that warzone we're just enjoying
some art
and now my dudes on to the main story at
hand
alex jones you all know him the
notorious
conspiracy theorist right wing i want to
say a lot of people consider him right
right wing
i don't consider him right wing i
consider him an alien
i feel like i'm making him affiliated
with the political party is like
aliens trying to pin down like
what country you exist to on mars
i don't know if that made sense i feel
like even mars is too
uh mars is too pl it's too s too
grounded of a yeah
uh well anyway we'll get into that but
essentially you guys know alex jones
um infowars he was recently
banned by youtube apple
spotify and facebook banned all his
channels removed
he um has been making videos since about
early 2001. now today he's mostly known
for
conspiracy theories and he's very right
leaning and that he has a lot of
conspiracy theories and
a lot of targeted opinions about like
hillary clinton
and obama and what what do you call the
the pizzagate stuff he was deep into
i find it kind of interesting if you go
back
into 2001 just to lay the groundwork on
who this guy
is back in 2001 i have this clip from
waking life
he wasn't really a politically
affiliated guy i just found this
interesting he was very much
anti-government anti-party
[Music]
of enemy propaganda rolling across the
picket line lay down g.i lay down gi
we saw it all very much just about the
government system of
control you know very much
he specifically says in this clip like
that
he's not a member of any party so
somehow his his you know
his style has changed since then
regardless um
so this is what happened this is
from verge which is confirmed by youtube
they confirmed this
this information here conspiracy
theorist alex jones youtube channel
received a strike on tuesday for
violating
the site's community guidelines verge
has learned youtube room four videos
from jones channel which has 2.4 million
subscribers
that contain instances of hate speech
child endangerment
sources familiar with the matter set
youtube channels are deleted if they get
three strikes in a three-month period
two videos contained hate speech against
muslims a third contain hate speech
against transgender people sources said
a fourth showed a child who was pushed
to the ground by an adult man under the
headline how to prevent liberalism all
four videos
yeah all four videos are currently
posted on infowars
now obviously i can't speak about those
specific four videos because
it's so hard to find
i mean his shit's been like scorched
earth from youtube and [ __ ] so it's
really hard to find the clips in
question
so i'm just you know reading the
description
uh but this one i do have the offending
video
oh those videos don't include a new one
which was one of his new greatest hits
of him making a threatening rant about
robert mueller
is it mueller or muller mueller i always
thought it's
molar but he's saying he says
we're stirred a controversy earlier this
week after was posted on facebook that
video does not appear to have been
uploaded to youtube post on infowars
said the video had been posted in a news
documentary scientific or artistic
contact
by the way there's anyway the first
reached out to infowars yada yada yada
jones channel previously received
strikes from youtube in february after
it promoted the false theory that
survivors of the parkland shooting were
actually trained crisis
actors that violated youtube's policy
against harassment and bowling
but strikes expired three months after
they are issued meaning jones child
currently
had just one strike against him now
i actually was able to find the clip of
him talking about robert mueller
and i thought well let's let's see what
kind of stuff this guy's saying
because the question right now the real
debate is like is this a
it's being framed by the people who
support alex jones as a political
silencing that he's being shut down
because
all these big tech companies are super
liberal leaning
and it's a it's a it's a political
shutdown
right it's censorship right so i'm like
all right well
like some of the videos they described
could easily be like
completely open to debate like they're
like pushing a children to the ground
it's like i don't know i have to see
that
yeah who knows but here i have this one
of molar
so let's watch this let me pop this baby
open
now this just happened uh very recently
that's the thing
is like once it's mueller everyone's so
scared
that's what he says he's in front of
people what she did so here we go
this is what he's saying that's the
[Music]

grandma like driving on the wrong side
of a comeback yeah

struck me as very oddly reckless
behavior it is but I think when you're
on the motorcycle you feel like you know
better than everyone I'm on a [ __ ]
motorcycle grandma I don't know they
scare me
because like all the sudden their
recklessness becomes my problem because
well I'm in traffic I'm not paying that
close attention to like what's in
between me and the next bar yeah all the
Sun I'm switching lanes yeah we have a
word for them she call some ancient
aliens what the motorcycle it's anyone
who's like you know they're driving the
wrong way down the road or they're like
just stopped it's ancient aliens the
crossing between old people that just
can't see and college kids that are just
dumb as hell that's just a mishmash
yeah irony you know that guy from H an
alien the crazy aliens that's who's
driving oh yeah exactly
well clearly they're like not in this
world right now they're like just it's
like what do you do you guys ever been
in a car crash ah I have not been
ancient alien she's written a lot of
accidents maybe she is after it
seriously never her fault but she's
always gentlemen what was it like what

getting Johnny boned at a red light
because here it was you know the back
okay

remember you blocking it out of your
memory suit just once
I kind of like I was someone was parked
like in the middle of the street I was
gonna go and then all of a sudden they
started to do parked in Miller Street
yeah like he was waiting for something
waiting for you so he could hate me but
it wasn't nothing serious it's all good
I mean that's it my dad really someone
was my dad is an ancient alien he's a he
is a liability have we told this story
about how in Mexico like probably my dad
is a psycho don't ever get in a car was
there you have like one star you were
driving around all day and nobody would
ever get like I don't know what happened
we were getting off an off-ramp and I
was I think in the back seat and he just
rear-ended a car just ran did somebody
like you do but there was that one time
in Mexico
he's got like a SUV and they used to
live in Mexico
and he's driving on the freeway in
Mexico like way over the speed limit so
fast that we're taking a sharp turn and
you can feel the tires are lifting
oh my god I said you could feel it being
like right my mom's in the car I'm in
the car he lives in the credits and
first time you guys in there right
sort of so imagine to impress er imagine
that imagine that this is you how you're
behaving around your son first time
you're meeting is serious and we're all
yelling my mom's going crazy we're all
yelling Gary and ela it doesn't even
know my dad I mean while my dad is so
crazy it's there silently doesn't even
acknowledge it continues to rip these
turns
it's weird I knew it was scary and my
dad he's he's on the road he what do you
see I don't know if you guys know about
like college rivalries yeah he went to
UCLA University of California they're
rivals in LA is USC they're like huge
sports rivals so his license plate said
hates SC and still I think maybe Tuesday
so when he sees some on the road with
the USC license plate like holder
license cut them off and I swear to you
with [ __ ] chill J in the car and both
family he will cut off another person on
the boat with his as if they were as if
they were not the Orphic sickness that's
scary scary sweet guy though anyway what
are your parents like your parents have
any crazy quarks like a teacher that's
crazy
[Laughter]
no she's a she I guess she has an excuse
because she's a teacher that is I mean
if you're a teacher for like four
five years you're like your mental
patient just keep going it's just like
worse than worse
what grade this you teach ah thanks for
stealing second or third oh wow let's
stop she used to teach middle school or
high school think high school and middle
school middle school was way worse she's
scary to me high school high school is
really bad middle school is really bad
yeah not the greatest which one's the
craziest middle school or second grade
think high school and middle school yeah
let's think in the fights yeah you're
like middle schools got to be the work
is dangerous right dangerous mines
what's that actress his name in
Dangerous Minds
you know that movie right she was like
this like pretty young blond teacher
who's teaching in like the hood that the
poetry one there could have been poetry
mmm Michelle Pfeiffer oh I didn't know
that it's called dangerous hell yeah
baby I love that movie throw that up let
me show you what your mom is up to her
Dangerous Minds gotta remember watching
this says it couldn't be in like damn
she's so cool oh she connects with
trench Oh can't really wear trench
coasters at school anymore so it's just
like real life
yeah it's like a mess constant right in
the chalkboard we want to die oh [ __ ]
it's Christ out we choose to die oh I
get it straight buster your mom do any
lessons like that think so but I think I
think middle school is the worst because
they're like in middle school you're
such a piece of [ __ ]
mm-hmm in high school you're starting to
learn a little bit that's true that
you're an idiot
yeah yeah you're still an idiot though
yeah full blown button it'll fall right
yeah Jason's mom looks just like him
well he looks like his mom it's cute
yeah they have the same like mouth and
nose kind of so I've got I'm trying this
new thing when we start our podcast
we're doing this thing called goof of
the day I've got some clips lined up and
I want to watch with you guys okay the
first one is DJ Khaled at performing at
an overwatch league it's great what I
love about this is that he's perfect
like DJ Kyle's not a performer right
like the tight man so imagine like
Flavor Flav without a band or anyone to
back them up with actual musical palette
it's just on a stage yeah it's crazy
here we go by the way you know they
frame this up so like there's like ten
people actually waving their arms well
the rest of the room is just like not
interested at all damn it's like Justin
Bieber is not there singing yeah DJ
count which is the worst part of every
music video
[Applause]
[Music]
it's like are you serious right now
that's a good question oh it's the phone
light no but you people are holding
their phones up there making it look
like they're holding their phones up no
way people have their phones out boys a
wristband it's probably like an event
wristband got it yeah it's there as well
going it looks confused you need to bet
you can't do DJ Khaled without the rest
of the band you know I mean like dj
khaled shouting another one is it
another where these have plants by the
way these guys were paid to dance dude
you're not even saying it damn
that's happening at this point may
really get your own concert but like
concert you you think that this could go
on for two hours straight having the
courage to yeah like a blizzard hired
them probably pay I mean I don't think
you can I was at all the performances
blizzard that was probably the number
one the most but you I mean speaking of
hip-hop you are kind of a hip-hop
musical performer now yeah your new
video came out chicken or chicken wings
right no I mean people are loving

musical taste if you had control in the
CDs what would you play I have one CD
versus sweat six yeah I don't know I
tend to just listen to like whenever it

all-time favorites actually I really
like Lana Del Rey which is like I know
she one of the ones that she one of the
ones that died or something she's like

like dang listened to I listened to a
lot of like 90s music I guess yes
there's the radio station that his bird
noises what's it called they're talking
about like Oh cats are the leading
killers of birds cats are the leading
there's a lot of bird watchers I've
heard that that like nice trip like cats
are actually decimating what do you know
if bird radio gets affected
here's this here's this music that they
dunk use interior let's see what we got
if you write any really really bad
blocks don't kind of a block on there is
that Internet Explorer you just you in
you out you open it with me
Internet Explorer looks like well it's
it's set to default like break I'm using
discord and I click a link when what
world would I want to open anything
Internet Explorer you see it's a total
disaster you know our sponsors pay us a
lot of money to get their ads on our
show and here they didn't pay me [ __ ]
don't download that you're seeing this
guy in concert this is your guy what's
his name
I'm Ashley Washington what's going on
with him he looks very like bohemian
he's cool as hell actually I danced it
man I interviewed him shot an interview
with him
was the was it an interesting interview
yeah yeah it was just talking about his
musical background and everything is you
know it comes from like the jazz world
but he kind of crossed over with all of
the brain feeder you know and Flying
Lotus and those people yeah yeah no he's
cool as [ __ ] do you say like Thundercat
yeah yeah yeah wonder cat and all those
guys sick you're all about you like that
soul like that soul music did you hate
Jews do you hate this I'll take the
trumpet for me
I got another video lined up another
goof of the day because I couldn't
decide between DJ Khaled and all of the
Mexican workers going on strike
and this guy filming it and losing his
mind about it okay good stuff lined up
guys
only the best video a Mexican together
[ __ ] so let me know anything about who
filmed so the story is that they're on
some kind of smelting plant and two of
the dudes I guess their boss supervisors
are calm yeah
comrades was their colleagues got fired
or sent home for some reason so they all
packed up and said [ __ ] this you know
salt solidarity so this guy who's
working with it I guess there's a bunch
of Mexicans and a couple black dudes so
this is one of the black dudes who's in
awe of the Mexican camaraderie and
spirit back they say don't be shut this
[ __ ] down playing with this
black people need to be own man I swear
I gotta learn
take the sim and look at this man by the
way god bless him
I mean jokes aside for documenting this
I'm with him dude that's cool it's
probably gonna get married
oh yeah he's fired oh yeah he'll never
work again I love it dude I'm with them
I'm in solidarity yeah so we need why
the hell do you think apples worth a
trillion dollars no unions they don't
have unions in China I don't think what
do you guys think about Apple being
worth a trillion [ __ ] dollars why are
you an apple man no iPhone though your
aunt your [ __ ] your foots in the
water you like Apple we don't really
have an opinion on it I guess well it's
very and we would have to look I don't
want to take any you know radical I
[ __ ] hate I'm using it very sparingly
waiting for the right going it yeah you
can you can use that just sucks that I
understand like I've all come you can
keep it of all companies in the world
how is it that Apple was the one that
got a trillion I mean what are they
doing that just yeah they're the most
money the most valued company of all
time the first company ever to be worth
the trillion dollars I mean there they
sell [ __ ] harkening
[Music]
many [ __ ] iPhones are they selling I
get it though cause everyone's obsessed
with the iPhone all over the world right
and their computers too
so it's like yeah I get it it's
expensive too like how the hope people
afford that [ __ ] but that means to me
that like their margins are insane
that they probably are exploiting hell
of people for those margins to be so
insane you know what I'm saying like for
someone to make a million dollars is
hard enough you have to like step on a
couple throats along the way they make
forget about it billion a billion
there's a couple hookers in your pool
under your pool whatever yeah there's
definitely something at least several
hundred immoral things happening yeah
Sachs is not being Oh Apple is notorious
but it's not just them and so every big
I was watching CNN they're doing this
whole clip about like God I just outed
myself for watching CNN so anyway
they're doing this whole thing about
like celebrating that Apple made a
trillion dollars and it's like yeah
they're doing this whole thing about
they were talking about in a very like
glorious way it wasn't like they were
doing party poppers and [ __ ] yeah
counter on the wall but like I don't
know what's the exact figure but they
have evaded so much money
tanks axes yeah like how many a trillion
dollars how many shiny like I mean do it
that's just Chinese lots of Chinese
people going down for those phones I
don't know what to say man lots of
Chinese people are going down for those
phones but it's okay
because they're Chinese you are
educating us we're newcomers to the
trillion dollar industry what crickets
that's all I need to wind us down here

fear of Elah right now it's true no

30-minute little app where we can just
kind of talk bring her back
get her back in see how she's doing and
then on Thursday we've got dunkey beta
game donkey and lea gonna be great with
that being said we've got so much to get
to but first
let's start with our goof of the day
let's try and think of a name Vlasic
goof of the day I like the idea when we
do these top of the weeks to start it
every time with a beautiful great little
video that we're all gonna love goof of
the day up first we've got laughter yoga
this video I'm very conflicted about
this video laughter yoga because well
yeah I'll just show you it's like these
people they all have these awful
diseases and their method of coping with
it is by manic laughing and I get it
like I think it's a cool thing but it's
like it's so eerie and strange I mean
let's just start it off right here guys
here we go god bless
diagnosis and we're gonna laugh again
yeah and so you go around the room it's
very powerful now if you don't and we'll
do it just with a few people here just
to get a flavour if anybody has a
diagnosis they want to share and laugh
about that'd be great and if you don't
then what I've done is combine it with
the haha mantra which is you'll say your
name and it happened recently to you
that normally would really bum you out
and share it with us and we'll laugh at
it so it's that whole psychology of you
know turning lemons into lemonade okay
so you guys get it this lady by the way
where do you get that earring I think on
face value it sounds nice but when you
watch it it's like I just don't buy the
laughter it's like the saddest [ __ ] I've
ever seen so here's I'll and I always
start and say here's how it looks so my
name is Geeta the one thing that throws
me off that makes me feel strange about
this is like why laughing after the name
it makes it seem like they're just
clowning yeah that was about trauma look
like they'll a comma
yeah they laugh after they say the
trauma but then like they're like hi my
name is Ethan it's like I feel like you
getting clowned on you're gonna see what
I mean that's that I don't know your
name for chrissake you know what I mean
it's like alright something's not right
and I was diagnosed with Parkinson's
disease
[Laughter]
[Applause]
anybody else wanna share get the idea
that's a strange it's a strange thing
you know very strange I get it you know
I get it it's a nice wholesome thing
they're trying to do here I just I don't
know it's so eerie there's something so
off about it you'll see it gets more
obscene as they go along but I don't get
the whole very good very good yay all
the sudden they're in kindergarten and
that was where they lost me to be honest
yeah I kind of understand it and but
then when the weird like cult chanting
started right it got pretty creepy right
there
yes dawn he took a shot at he took a
shot
you know he put his hand up in class my
name is dawn why you got a goof why you
got a clown on poor dawn
that's so weird I they laugh at their
name it's hard not to see you like them
just laughing at their misfortune
they're not it just I don't see them
like embrace from my perspective I just
acquired insulin resistant diabetes I
don't know I just sounds like they're
clowning on hysterical that's the
funniest [ __ ] I've heard all day
[Laughter]
[Applause]
well are you gonna comment for us Viki
that's the one that got me
I've got breast cancer that's the funny
[ __ ] I've heard all year this woman's
eyes really lit up on that one yeah no
she's like she's like oh [ __ ] the more
tragic the more hilarious my name is
Vicki and I was I was stranded and had
to eat my own son to stay alive it's
like the more tragic the more hilarious
[Laughter]
[Music]
yes I don't buy it I think I just don't
buy it like she's got the happy face
earrings she's got the laughter yoga
she's all smiles but there's like a real
sadness you know what I mean it's like
they're not acknowledged I don't know
what do is healthy no yeah that's what I
don't know I don't know something about
this seems so demented and I don't want
to goof on these people because you know
they're trying to cope with some
difficult stuff just trying to analyze
how I feel about it
let's see maybe the next one is just
like straight up like you know my
husband I'm Dan and I murdered my son
right and I ate his corpse very good
very good yay
[Laughter]
oh I didn't even let her like they cut
they kind of cut her off they did like
an Academy Award on her that's like I
was developed with MS 19 years ago it's
like alright [ __ ] tone it down it's old
news it's not good it's also like I
didn't give you permission to expand you
have MS move on to the next person we're
all [ __ ] dying here my name is uh hi
guys my name is Ethan and my anal
sphincter muscle has stopped operating
and I'm perpetually [ __ ] my pants
that's really not that tragic compared
to what they're doing with what's you
know let's see how we're good whoa what
was that let me go back got that got a
huge lot is it just that she's over but
you need to leave doesn't qualify for
yoga laughter by the way she wasn't like
oh I'm overweight I'm morbidly
overweight she's like some people think
people get the [ __ ] you know what you
get a bill
and you get crickets we got breast
cancer we got MS you know to be here all
over wait shut the [ __ ] up I'm a little
overweight yeah wouldn't be graved she
was just like you know what stop
everyone stop laughing [ __ ] get out she
just actually laughing now she's like
this isn't laughs yoga I'm laughing at
you why would you need a group council
just because you're some people think
you're overweight give it up you you you
were you're in a different room
sometimes you get scared of running out
of money you and the fat lady need to go
start your own laughter yoga okay what
what
don't worry whatever for you and
everybody dude yeah chuckle at best you
don't deserve the laughs if I'm being
Frank and chuckle yoga anyway I'm not
sure how to make of all this stuff it's
like I know they're they're desperately
trying to cope with really awful and
unimaginable things but it's like it's
just so eerie and strange to see these
things side by side and I'm dying of
breast cancer yeah
anyway I have one other goof of the day
that I wanted to watch with you guys the
pedo lizard today it's goofs of the day
today my friend well this the story is
that this video was used to be shown to
middle schoolers back in the 90s to help
inform them about I guess this is one
like the pedophile scare started when
every random male specifically males was
looking to abduct you so this this
little short here was meant to educate
define innocent young children of
America and to avoiding being taken so
here I give you the pedo hunting
dinosaur bro I'm gonna tell you straight
up if there's any pedophile it's in that
[ __ ] suit listen to that voice man
and I'll tell you what else there's
enough space in that suit for a man and
a child like he could he could be like
climbing my suit young one hi there whoa
damn you're about to see a show for
parents and children about tricking
people now if you're wondering who
tricky tricky people that's a nice way
to save child rapists children drinking
drinking drinking drinking people
everywhere you look bro you're trying to
[ __ ] and also what's wrong with you like
why like this dinosaur character is just
so strange he's like I looking
everywhere
there's rapist everywhere it's like at a
certain point if you see them that
frequently you're looking too hard maybe
you're looking you need to look inward
like this dinosaurs is a real true pedo
hair I mean really and it kind of my
name is Reginald charming
put this show on here today didn't I
just miss your mom by the way this is
like the the main villain with the same
Reginald charming yes last night
charming it's like these guys are
[ __ ] the guys who made this all right
I swear to God you have to touch kids to
dream the [ __ ] up like you have to have
at least have a couple of children in
your slavery dungeon the dream of this
yellow jazz talking dinosaur anti-child
rape superhero and the name of villain
mr. charming I'm mr. charming what the
[ __ ] do they sound like Chris Rock oh no
not the old puppies in the car routine
he's [ __ ] Reginald up - he's like
citizen justice I feel like I don't know
what they're advocating but this guy
hasn't raped any kids and you're letting
your strong-arming him against a wall
man also it's like such a Chris Rock
impersonation it's stripping me out it's
a great [ __ ] imagine being in middle
school and trying to extrapolate meaning
from this this is just so insane is he
explicitly a dinosaur
I don't know else he could be yeah it's
[ __ ] weird maybe he's you did you see
since city where they chop off the pedos
balls and he turns yellow maybe well
this is evolution he's a yellow man yeah
he's a castrated pedophile oh I'm an
upstanding citizen
[Music]
so dude this [ __ ] so [ __ ] so he tricks
all these little girls into doing a
photoshoot for him and he's in there
taking photos and look at his creepy
little friend like cheering him on and
then at the end which I'll show you the
dinosaur breaks into his office to get
the photos it's amazing it was all a
sting operation the arrests of the
dinosaurs well you'll see there's a
twist between the lines which I'd like
you guys to watch mutters - there's a
lot to unpack here and I'm really not
sure what's the meaning I think the
meaning is the lizards the pet Oh
everyone's the pet Oh trust nobody at
all Wow this whole pedo hysteria is so
strange like I don't know that there was
this crazy pedo hysteria when I was this
age but these days it's like don't don't
run don't play outside by yourself or
there's a hundred percent chance that
someone's gonna rape you immediately
it's like how many immediately you're in
how many rapists pedos are out there
lurking I don't know I never got show
one of these when you were growing up
though no because I'm not this one but I
explicitly remember the pedo video when
I was like in elementary school but we
have the Dan cam up we do oh great how's
it look well I'm not on it right now
Oh have you guys seen the Dan cam we
haven't used it yet the Dan cam you're
talking but it's it's hard to explain
but if I'm just sitting here like an
idiot like this and you're talking hit
the Dan cam but nobody's in the Dan cam
right now oh you're not gonna Dan cam
yeah we got Ian screening calls
all right north play I'm gonna cut to
Dan cam it's just an empty room I never
I was on the Dan Cameron it was on a Dan
cam
I was never shown any anything like this
you know all you get is like a don't get
in a car with strangers I mean what more
do you need to know don't take if some
guys offering you candy you know don't
let him put a finger in your ass unless
it's like a full tootsie roll
definitely not for like a little Tudor
oh that's not worth the finger than ass
if it was like a full-on like king-size
Tootsie Roll you could basically put
four fingers up my ass even today
frankly speaking good to know is it
great why you got a Tootsie Roll
a little later tonight you have a
dinosaur costume you want to roleplay
[Music]
oh by the way his voice changes from he
goes from he goes from what's his name
Chris Chris Rock he goes from Chris Rock
to Bruce Willis real quick hey man did
he change race his voice changed race I
want Carmen's pictures that CD looks
like a nipple am i right [ __ ] got him
that record on the wall it's a [ __ ]
nipple got him what are you talking to
oh my god
I don't know what Carmen told you but
there are no pictures give me the
combination charming
figure it out you big stupid lizard you
think you're so smart
well you can't watch them all the time
nobody can
[Music]
or finish so he takes off with the photo
so the question is the dinosaur walked
out with the photos those that is not
you that is not admissible evidence so
the question I have is were seek along
with those photos you know what I'm
saying you can't use those in court you
just barge in and stolen that it was
safe so what exactly is he doing with
those photos yeah I mean he didn't show
up at the cops he's just kind of this
vigilante who kicked in the door stole
the child porn he's going straight home
what's that yeah what the bug just like
you know share the [ __ ] wealth man I
[Laughter]
love how dramatic that God that like
take Kiki and get out of here yeah man
he's gonna go beat off to those photos
I've never been sure of anything more in
my life so that's a weird one that that
really I don't know that threw me for a
loop that video that was wild dude
amazing man they used to put kids in a
you know auditorium the whole class 500
people or whatever I don't know and
watch this I mean what I wish I had been
shown that one the one I was shown was
super awkward and just serious you know
what I mean right I think that's
probably a better approach was I'm not
sure I could extrapolate any meaning
that avoid yellow dinosaurs anyway
that's the goof of the day I hope you
guys had fun with that give it up
wasn't that a good time everybody well
we are we have up we have fun out here
they should podcast experience don't we
we have a lot of fun here let's get on
to the main stories Logan Paul Wow
who's ever talked about him MRIs that
well there was this one tweet I honestly
couldn't let go
I had to show to you guys because it
really was so insane that even even now
I read it and I was just like whoa right
he erased it
after shortly after tweeting it cuz
everyone was just like wow this isn't
saying so this is only from a couple
days ago he says and I quote board the
plane flight attendant gives me the old
I ball up and down hi Sox short shorts
saggy blond hair shaggy
saggy tits picture-perfect [ __ ] boy give
him my ticket first class stunned he
goes oh wow
and points me to my seat don't judge a
book by it's cover Wow Todd what a hero
there's there's a lot to actually unpack
here I feel like well first of all this
never happened it's just let's just
establish this right off the bat
sleepily
the only thing it's missing is everybody
in the airplane standing up and
applauded even a big applause yeah
Albert Einstein gave them yeah that and
the only thing that's missing is that
flight attendant Albert Einstein this
never [ __ ] happened dude at this
point you're like 24 there's no excuse
for running this [ __ ]
this is like what a twelve-year-old
fantasizes about then second of all he
acknowledges that he dresses like a
[ __ ] clown high socks short shorts
shaggy blond hair picture-perfect [ __ ]
boy picture if you're a [ __ ] if you're
gonna sit there and acknowledge that you
look like an idiot and that you're a
[ __ ] boy let's just change your outfit
he's basically you know what he's saying
is I'm wearing all maverick [ __ ] to sell
it to these kids but I would never want
to wear this because I look like a [ __ ]
boy but I do it like there's something
in there you know there's a weird
modicum of also awareness bigger than
their for sure like well who is this
flight attendant that's never seen a
rich
person who's apparently works
first-class their flight attendant oh
wow oh my god your first class just
imagine this person I'm so sorry
oh my god oh wow
I'm so sorry I judge you and then of
course the subtle bragging about being
rich and flying first-class but what
exactly are you asking not to judge
there's no nothing about your character
he's saying don't don't make a judgement
if someone's rich or poor be careful who
you rude to because they might be rich
the [ __ ] what's the moral of this story
Logan he's trying to bring awareness to
the rampant persecution of fuckboys in
this country that honestly is probably
the biggest social issue he's not
dealing he's not denying that he's a
fuck-boy he's like I'm a rich [ __ ] boy
and therefore you judged a book by its
cover
it's like dude basically he's saying
because he's wealthy he's superior I
mean that's really what's so nin here
and to that I say you are [ __ ] a
really a this is really one of the worst
tweets I've ever read and he always says
I'm a kid and he always says thirty year
old man and all that shake he would call
me a 33 year old man year that excuse is
not I mean this is really probably the
dumbest thing I've ever read by a public
personality how long did he keep this up
before he well that's 30,000 like so I
mean probably half a day or more was he
getting a bunch of [ __ ] for it
like what yeah I'm sure how did he
become self-aware suddenly that that is
[ __ ] awful yeah he was probably
getting [ __ ] for it and he was he's

today okay Lucy to Daddy oh five and so
many more goofs and gaffes along the way
but I really like as we did last time I
was in here the trenches by myself you
start off with a great video video of
the day does that have a that work feel
like it was a better the better title I
was thinking video of bliss it's a bit
over the top isn't it video of bliss I'm
gonna think on it but I actually had two
that I thought were so great
I wanted to watch it at the top with you
this one I got to tell you you're gonna
you're gonna love this
I can't I I'm such a skeptic I feel like
part of me thinks this is fake but I
have to believe in my soul and heart
that it's real here we go
this crawfish caught the [ __ ] penny
Oh show that again yeah and that guy's
just like I mean how do you react when
you throw a penny at a crawfish and it
catches it it's claw how do you react
that's pretty much the only way but then
it begs the question why was he filming
to begin with right yeah yeah that's why
are you filming a crawfish on a bathroom
floor and then throwing a penny at it
like what in what world is this
something that you film that makes me
suspicious yet again I've come full
circle that being said I don't know I
feel like it's real it [ __ ] looks
real but I love why why why we need we
need the captain we need the captain
back yeah when the captain disillusion
don't worry but like why would someone
film this I mean what oh it's from
Instagram yeah everything there's fake
anyway I love it regardless and then
there's one other one that I had to
share with you guys this is one of my
favorite videos to come from the
internet in these past weeks this guy
went to City Hall and gave an
impassioned speech not about you know
traffic or politics or whatever city
ordinance tax [ __ ]
you would hear at City Council no this
man came was something much more
important and pressing he came asking
that massage therapist be able to jerk
you off sometimes you got to go with
sometimes you have to go to City Hall to
get to fight for your rights why can't a
massage therapist touch my dick if I pay
her an extra 20 bucks 20 bucks is that
it that's probably a good deal it's
probably more than that
anyway here yeah anyway this guy
obviously says it better than I ever
could so with that you know here you
going seems quiet Dan it's a little
different dude are you why is it
different than you know you're right why
is it different hell we let ask doctors
finger men basically finger men all day
not basically literally literally finger
men's [ __ ] all day
this guy's a hero dude don't question
him I love that his in the crutch of his
argument is what's worse I got to go
back is that really was the argued he's
like it's more nasty for the
proctologist so let just let him jerk
him off right he's saying what's the
difference you're already getting in the
folds when I just touched his dick along
the way compelling argument I'd like to
see a counterpoint made to that
right right
hey man brother what a patriot right Wow
Wow full circle right there
amen brother that guy's definitely a
comedian right he's got the socks and
sandals that would truly be a happy
ending for everyone
[ __ ] amen brother Danny fuer
have you ever had got a massage like
like a full-body Swedish massage Dan I
have not I have seriously yeah never
done it I was gonna ask if like I've
gotten a couple times but I was [ __ ]
applause sound effect I was gonna ask if
it's ever moved when you were getting a
massage I mean I can't say in a
professional setting I mean you know
obviously in private that's a different
that's a different tale altogether but
no I it's it's too weird I don't know I
have like I have a some time I'm just
saying it sometimes it moves sure I mean
it's a natural what are you gonna do can
you do anyway god bless - this guy Ian
has it ever moved for you have you ever
had a massage in he's off at set right
now he's starting sprinkles all right
ah God let's just say that he has though
okay um so anyway I salute this Patriot
and I'm all about it all right but that
being said let's get let's get into them
the main event here fouseytube I feel
like it's like a repeat almost of last
week when we talked about Connie tannic
on just trying to decode and explain
what's happened so fussy fouseytube if
you guys don't know who he is he's a he
began as a prankster and he faked
a lot of pranks he almost he invented
almost like the moral the righteous fake
prank where it was like what was the
example you gave me dan where he had one
more oh yeah he's like he stands in the
street and he's yelling at people for
not having like their seatbelt on or
something I don't know just like he's
always got to have like a moral twist on
it he kind of invented that whole thing
so anyway he fell off I'm pretty sure
he's been having a lot of mental issues
and it seems like he's in a full-blown
manic state right now I mean he let's
start here let's start from the top yeah
he says with two million viewers Drake
is going to grace the stage of my
concert he's only got two thousand likes
that seems like a far away off two
million views
anyway he keeps saying that Drake's
gonna be at a show Drake's gonna be at a
show he's never he never talked to Drake
he's ever known Drake he's he sells out
the Greek a free show and he says
Drake's gonna be there and obviously
Drake never shows up
but basically what ensues is a lot of
insanity a lot of confusion and a very
little crowd and him stalking Drake
which is probably the best and I mean
the best the most entertaining and
concerning thing to come out of this
whole thing this video pretty much sums
it all up for me let me throw this up
here for you this this video really has
it all its got stalking it's got a
Jarama let's hear it
quiet dant can you turn it up
yep got you to the people by the way
he's taking this clip from someone
else's show an upload this is a video on
his channel right now so to put it in
frame here so that this is when it gets
really good so I think he probably spent
about $100,000 reserving the Greek and I
will say to his credit I mean I don't
want to compare it to Tana Kong because
what Tana did was basically sell
supposedly free tickets and didn't even
give on the event or refund people his
was free so at least there's there's the
a big separation to be made there I mean
he's not scamming people he's just
misleading people but it's a free show
but what's really fascinating is just
his clear mental decline here watch this
is he is he I mean I can't tell if he's
just like cracked out or if he's just on
a manic rant yeah it it seems very manic
yeah it seems very American and isn't he
he publicly has a history of that does
he not he yes yeah he's bipolar he said
right so I just yeah I don't know I
think people give fousey well let's keep
watching let's get the whole frame of
reference here
great I'm trying to find some thought of
item I'd like this please so tomorrow
we've had theater I love that he
included that I don't know who it was I
don't even know if it was a police
officer could have just been normal guy
who's just like [ __ ] this idiot
get back in your car he goes from being
like a total badass to being like oh I'm
sorry dude it's or nothing but he leaves
it in which I find curious he clearly
could have edited that out
he finished his statement but he got and
I and I hate to say this but he got
cooked a little bit by whoever was on
the street you know what I mean and he
left that in find the interesting now
this is when it get takes a really dark
twist I mean first of all dude if
there's a setting for any video talking
to a celebrity this is him I mean look
at look at this frame he's mean dude
this is straight out of like a horror
movie like are you in my basement right
now foo see I mean listen what he says
he's got the dongles hanging out those
dongles are not a good look for anybody
by the way let alone a celebrity stalker
but let's watch cool you've acknowledged
stop there I literally look and I'm
acting like a crazy person right now cuz
I'm outside of the house you're at stop
there dude you just you just summarized
it but he knows that it's not actually
crazy even though it is
don't ask me how I found it
I've got ways creepy creepy ways you're
probably wondering how did I find you
you're probably wondering to yourself
right now how did I find you and do I
need to call the police and get a
restraining order do I need to have my
bodyguards bodyguards escort them out
you're probably wondering don't worry
about that don't worry it's interesting
how we on one hand acknowledges all this
how creepy he's being right and on the
other hand fully committed it seems so
manic is it doesn't see yeah doesn't
seem like he's intoxicated or like on
drugs or anything he's very clear-headed
about it it's just nuts
well symptoms of a manic episode I mean
here let's read it off abnormally upbeat
jumpy or wired boom increased activity
energy or agitation boom exaggerated
self sense of well-being and
self-confidence yes unusually talkative
racing thoughts distractibility I mean
yeah yep it's extras the little layer of
creepy that he keeps playing that God's
plan loop this is like such a creepy
stalker video of like a weird fan
food.if who see ends up killing Drake
I'll be like 10% surprised God's plan
baby you might be thinking to yourself
he's like over him Drake's sleeping in
his bed and foo sees like hovering over
him you might think this is a little
strange Drake but this is God's plan for
me to murder you right now in fact if
you look down you'll notice is already a
knife in your stomach I mean you know
what he does meanwhile he's got on his
phone God's plan looping
God's plan little bit psycho and God's
plan
damn damn he's he's gonna come down to
earth and cut in like I don't know how I
don't know how long manic episodes last
but he's gonna be like oh I don't know
if Uzi he's an interesting guy like I
don't know if I feel bad for him in a
way because it's like he's it's it's
such a strange situation with him
because he has a fan base like when
you're when you're having a manic
episode and having delusions of grandeur
the fact that he actually has a fan base
and people encouraging him right that
makes it all so much more [ __ ] dot so
much worse he's just enables his
delusions it's crazy
can you imagine how [ __ ] having a
30-second conversation this never
happened I promise that this event is
gonna be huge but I need you for it to
be huge it's like yeah [ __ ] obviously
he doesn't need you though
unfortunately he goes one way I'm like
I'm like listen guys I'm putting on the
hugest show of the year all I need is
two POC and biggie to return from the
grave and co-host it with me and it's
gonna be the biggest concert ever put on
yeah sick hype bro how long to take you
to make that and premiere oh hey now my
video can get copyrighted just [ __ ] me
up
thanks really thanks foo see you're
[ __ ] all of our monetization up now
now I got beef with you
where's my mouse so he uploaded on his
channel
I mean it's still up of him literally
here's a this always trips me out when I
can see myself it's still up of him
publicly stalking a celebrity on his
channel which just shows you how unaware
he is of how strange is his behaviors so
that's that's where that's kind of where
it began he's now withdrawn from from
the internet right I don't know he's
retreated back into into his cave yeah I
don't know he he he posted a diss track
on rice gum which I find strange like I
clearly acting's not working out for
your dog that was a pretty corny read
clear clearly acting uh not working out
for me like I just acted that out better
than him when I was trying to act that
can I and that was really Khaled on the
phone crazy crazy so anyway it's just
it's really just another YouTube hip-hop
fit it you guys seen a thousand of these
rap video but what I found fascinating
about this was the vision board here let
me play for a second just so you can
kind of put into perspective what he
hoped for this song
it's a rice gum district so anyway you
get that I mean really get the idea
that's all you need to see so his vision
for this rice come district is number
one song on Billboard Hot 100 can you
imagine the country banking to a race
come dis track 350 million views in
under three months when what [ __ ]
planet it's a race come dis track bro
like if you wanted to actually make an
accessible song why would you just write
it about anything else club banger on
radio in the entire world at least once
a day manifest your dreams just as I did
man I swear to god I'm I feel like I'm
entering the mind of madness reading
this help each other achieve each
other's dream kill your ego you got a
long way to go there buddy
so I thought that was pretty pretty cute
pretty interesting well guys I mean we
can get it there we got to get this on
top billboard number one I'm sure it's
really close it's climbing it's climbing
fast god I really need a look back I
need a live a kid next week next week
next week baby Wednesday no [ __ ]
underwear I always joke about people
getting [ __ ] stains I'm like who gets
[ __ ] stands I'm in pants with [ __ ] and
piss inside of it I'll show you if you
don't believe me there's little [ __ ]
streaks
I've got shmegmer building up on my
penis I didn't have foreskin Eva changes
my diaper and cleans my dick telling you
ela please come back where was I event
yada yada yada
he holds the event at the Greek a free
show how many C's does a Greek have like
10,000 not quite where's this video okay
whatever
Greek holds I believe around
six or seven thousand okay pretty big
show so this this is my favorite thing
cut so this is the show it's happening
the fousey hasn't even showed up but
this this is the [ __ ] crowd I mean
what is that like 20 people there at the
stage and this DJ man god bless his soul
crushing it huh look at the employees
they're like what is this like these
guys are you still like assuring like
huge so how depends what the [ __ ] is
this I swear to God food CMOS I I mean
getting the Greek we were gonna spend
twenty five thousand just to rent out
the ACE which is a two thousand seat
theater right that was twenty five
thousand this on all this [ __ ] I'd say
at least a hundred thousand he spent on
this yeah and I mean the Greek is it's
an iconic venue it's very very much in
demand yeah it's not not cheap well on a
weekend - oh yeah on a weekend damn yeah
that's that's a pretty penny right there
it's trying to hype up the crowd
well I don't know man you're mixing
doesn't sound that good I love that even
the DJs in on this ludus delusion
what if Drake just walked on stage right
now to the hundred of you huddled around
the stage he'd be so mad no dude it's
because you not drink
killing it brushing it damn that's a
that is a coal to crowd my dudes that
that's the vibe there there's basically
nobody there and then someone calls it
because it's live-streaming it's got
like 60,000 views he said he was gonna
get two million Drake was gonna come out
there's like a thousand people there
sixty thousand people watching online
that's kind of a lot to be honest but I
think most people are watching just for
the beautiful train wreck that they knew
it was gonna be and somebody called a
bomb threat which is just like cherry on
top I mean it's like I'm not surprised
I'm not surprised there are conspiracy
theories and I have to say they're
compelling because you always have to
ask yourself who benefits the most from
this crime bomb threats called could
totally be anyone on the internet I mean
that is a that's a juicy mean but a
fousey called the bomb threat he wasn't
at the venue yet he was waiting to see
how big it got if Drake would just I
don't know what he thinks happen if like
Drake was just like materialized he's
like two million I'm here but if he
called it in himself I wonder if he was
able to get a refund to be like oh man
the show never happened or oh I have to
be embarrassed because Drake never
showed up you know what I'm saying he
kind of benefited the most from that
bomb threat which is why it's a
compelling conspiracy theory and I'm not
saying that how dare you say I would
never say or implicate or say and it
make any statement like that there's an
opinion you know what I'm saying there's
a thought experiment I'm merely asking
[Music]
welcome one and all to the h3 podcast
experience we're trying to compete with
Joe Rogan over here
hell yeah my theory is that a podcast
can never compete with an experience
he's got an experience right so I'm
trying to even the playing field a
little bit
you needed sea weed pills or something
yes I need some kind of supplement
experience supplement thank you to hims
a Felix gray an audible for sponsoring
us today and if you haven't already
guessed today I would say our group
arguably the most successful youtuber of
all time Oh Bieber Bieber yeah I can't
there's no argument no number can we say
number two no I because like the idea is
that like if you make stuff outside of
YouTube you're more successful I don't
think that's true I'm saying like there
youtubers make way more money than me
may not agree more people I mean I don't
think it's like you know it's legit and
successful just because you you know in
my mind I feel like it there's some
truth to it if you can escape in a way
it's almost it is an escape because it
really frees you like what you do with
your comedy acts is kind of not
compatible with YouTube you think kind
of I don't know well it's like maybe
maybe not the whole stage and the
lighting and all the coordination and my
appearance for a year yeah well that
that's really why I left are not left I
when I was you moved on I just wanted to
do live stuff I mean even when I was
posting the early videos like I just
wanted to perform on stage I was doing
theater that's what I wanted to do even
I was performing those videos like I'd
be like I really want to go to stage
with these and then I performed them on
stage and if I had posted the video it
wouldn't get that much of a reaction
realize like oh if I didn't post this
stuff and people heard it for the first
time in the room is was it was exciting
so well I didn't introduce you Bo
Burnham okay basically I would say one
of the most beloved called me acts for
the past decade including two of my
favorite what and make happy on Netflix
you see both are Netflix what's on
YouTube yeah what's back on Netflix its
back it's everywhere it's everywhere
folks and he's just written and directed
a new movie that's out today on limited
release right
nationwide in two weeks yeah New York
and LA and then it'll be out somewhere
else
eighth-grade which by the way is getting
rave reviews 98 percent on Rotten
Tomatoes whoa let me hit you with the
sounds actually 99 now whoa they raised
it you're like you know what
98 [ __ ] that yeah yeah 99 ooh can we get

the screening and I absolutely loved it
you missed the screening I missed the
screening so I went saw it last night
okay okay okay how how are you feeling
about it I mean the movies out it's
getting rave reviews it's getting rave
reviews I'm feeling great I won't say
I'm really grateful to be here I'm a fan
of yours either a fan of the podcast is
true you know and though I haven't been
like posting a lot on YouTube I'm
watching the [ __ ] all the time
really yeah all the time I mean like my
main relationship with the Internet is
as a viewer and as someone just who do
you ask who do you of frequent like who
do you like you're you know you're one
of the few people like it's very popular
that I watch I mean I don't know if it's
like getting to me but like ila I it's
sort of what the movie ended up being
like I love people on the internet then
no one's watching
I love the review review bruh I love to
review bro yeah yeah report of the week
oh yeah he's yeah he's a legend
incredible yeah but I really love like
people on the internet that no one's
watching so I'll often like search
something and then view it by upload
date oh yeah I mean you're a d gritty
yeah so I love deep dives like there's
this dude who's a hoarder who cooks hot
dogs on candles and it's very nauseating
is he have character or is it just the
it's the intrigue of it all does he have
character like it's he very entertaining
or no more bone chilling it's chill yeah
yeah yeah it's like him like can we
should we give him a shout-out I don't
know his name and I don't know it's not
lawyer yeah and it really is like he
takes a tour of his like hoarding house
and he cooks like he calls some sausages
and there's a video of him making
sausages and peaches it's aptly
incredible we could probably pull it out
yeah it's one cooking sausages and it's
really not yeah
Ian try bind us the hotdogs and sausages
or the P calls it sausages and peaches
but it is most certainly hotdogs okay
but no I just like I I don't know but
yeah I watch them from the background
and I want to talk a lot about that but
first I want to ask like what was your
motivation almost for writing this film
because it's a departure it's kind of a
surprise to a lot of your fans of like
oh wow where did this movie come from
it's very specific yeah every - with a
very specific narrative like you had a
purpose so I'm wondering what was what
motivated you kind of to go that route
it was like it's about a girl like a 13
year old girl last week eighth grade and
you know I did stand up for me and found
it already by the way but amazing well I
I it'll be a it'll be a hard living face
conversation I I you know perform Santa
for a long time and I was feeling
anxious and I wanted to sort of talk
about the Internet and my own anxiety in
a way and so I had felt like my anxiety
for a long time was like very specific
to me being a 25 year old comedian with
like an audience and then I would like
do my shows and like young kids would
come up to me and say they felt like me
and they felt like they knew what I was
going through even when I was talking
about was like being on stage in front
of thousands of people I'm like why is
this resonating with you and I just
think the sort of pressures the weird
pressures that are usually only afforded
to like d-list celebrities have now been
democratized and given to everybody so I
was always interested in like who are
the telling a story about someone on the
internet that nobody's watching because
the Internet tends to and the culture at
large tends to only talk about the
people on the internet that are being
mean but the majority people on the
internet and there's a lot more and more
who are just talking to the camera
nobody's watching yeah that's 99 percent
of the videos that are uploaded 99.9 you
know and the kind of the only thing we
talk about is like people that go viral
and as someone that went viral it's
really not that interesting yeah yeah
it's like the actual interesting thing
is just trying to engage with this thing
and trying to be seen and trying to be
heard and to me the people that weren't
being heard were actually engaged
much deeper more honest thing well there
was one of the central themes I think
that I extracted from it was like how
social media or this abundant of all
this going on with YouTube and Twitter
and Instagram is affecting kids because
I think there's a five year difference
between us but when I grew up there was
no like growing up as a kid was hard
enough yeah but then when you have all
this new social media introduced to them
and the way that you portray the girl
how she's glued to these social medias
is very accurate I think like how is
this affecting kids I don't know all the
time is that it I don't quite know
exactly like and truly it was me wanted
to talk about how it felt to me and how
it felt to me was it made me feel
nervous and weird and unsure of myself
and that seems like I you mean social
media yeah yeah just having to sort of
represent yourself having to live your
life and then also live your life on
this other place and then the sense of
like because of that floating behind
yourself through situations I just think
it's like weird and disembody and like a
little disassociative or something but
more than anything it was like I I'm
happy for people to like leave the movie
thinking about that stuff but I don't
want the movie to be like a TED talk or
like gonna be some like finger wagging
[ __ ] because that's what it's so noisy
it wasn't by the way let me just say one
last thing yeah but but like that I
don't know it just feels like the
internet hasn't even in least in popular
media hasn't even been described let
alone figure it out like so so yeah I
just wanted to portray it and portray it
how it feels to her and me a little bit
which is just weird it's just like it's
a lot but if it's not like it's just
shitty it's not like it's like we should
just if we have to our phones in the
ocean we'd be happy it's like it's both
we're super connected we're super lonely
we're super stimulated we're super numb
we're self expressing and objectifying
it's like yeah I wouldn't be here
without the internet you know I mean
like obviously I'm so so grateful for it
but also it's you know there's there may
be a happy medium between like the 60
minutes talking about like yes
narcissistic kids and like come on
creators or whatever the [ __ ] that you
you
tube conversation is where it can't
self-examine at all I feel like well on
my part I'm a grown man more or less and
I've recently pretty much quit using
social media because it's it's honestly
too much for me for me like uh like even
me for a long day ahead like a quota for
myself fry was like I need a post every
day on Twitter once yeah because it in a
way it's like if I don't tweet do I
exist though mmm like am I still in the
minds of these people and I found by the
way that the answer is very much yes you
still do exist if you don't tweet but
like there was just a really unhealthy
interaction I had with it like checking
that first thing in the morning to
assorted to sitting down to pee be on my
phone I was like this is [ __ ] up this
is totally because you don't really get
a lot of time out of that you sit down
at well you mean what does that buy you
like 30 second 30 40 minutes at most
right no that's a condition yeah yeah
we'll get into that but yeah I but that
that is part of what the movies hope
when you get out is that like it isn't
like sit down to pee and you use your
phone and for that so you would just
open Twitter really fast while you were
on the John yeah and if it's cold I'll
piss through the space in the the seat
in the bowl and all over my pants it's
nothing happens does that happen you
still die stepping when I was a kid and
I would have like a morning would and
like cuz your dick points down into the
bowl yeah definitely but you're still
able to pee through the hole yeah soft
yeah I was just kidding so I yeah I was
trying to explore that yeah yeah no no
no I was like totally kidding I just
made up a really specific joke that's
never happened um you've never peed
through the crack when you were a kid
all right let's get off let's get it
let's get off I try to be vulnerable
with you yeah all right but yeah I think
like people people look at me I'm like
am so glad I'm not in eighth grade
anymore I'm so glad I'm not so awkward
on I don't have to deal with social
media and I'm like you're the worst
people on social media are thirty roles
and yeah hit people in their late 20s
like from talking with the kids the kids
have the best chance of being chill on
it cuz they like actually have a little
bit of self-awareness and kind of have
grown up with it it's the 30 year olds
that pretend like they're not
you know addicted to it and be
sooo I just like I can't believe what my
friends look like online I can't believe
there's so many people that I don't mind
in real life and I hate them just hate
them and there's never the opposite
there's never anything like what is it
that they do online that makes you hate
them it's just so transparent right what
everyone's doing things trying to look
like peachy and trying to look PG or
trying to or trying to be ironically
peachy or you know like I mean
humblebrag is the word of right of the
21st century well I heard you say
something that I really liked is
something that's been ringing with me is
like if you ironically hate something
it's not really better than like if you
are Roenick lee if you're self-aware of
doing something that you didn't like
yeah it's not really different you know
everyone like you see that on YouTube a
lot of people being like click baiting
ironically but yeah yeah well you still
know you're still doing that it's like
and I did that when I was 16 17 was like
buy my merch I'm a sellout it's like
that no you're still a [ __ ] yeah he
doesn't being self-aware saves you
nothing you know the most and it's like
the ironic [ __ ] the most ironic [ __ ]
online is like Old Spice commercials and
Geico commercials where they're going on
being like this is a Geico commercial
wink and it's like [ __ ] you yeah there's
like Deadpool it's like a 200 million
dollar movie winking at you and it's
like is that cool yeah I don't know I'm
just saying like this sort of like
surrealist cool crazy Adult Swim like
aesthetic has been totally co-opted by
like Allstate hey on Allstate but you
what I'm saying I feel like it's I don't
know yes it just feels yeah to me let me
ask you how does making a movie compared
to your other creative endeavors that
you've done so far it was good I was
just desperate to work with other people
I was like um you know stand-up you just
look to yourself and I was so tired of
my own head yeah I mean I was just so
tired of my voice in my face so I just
want to work with people again I did
theater like growing up and that's why I
really loved that's not like when I fell
in love with [ __ ] so yeah I was just
about working with people and getting
out of my own head and that was nice
that's awesome because like trying to
explore my own anxiety by being alone on
stage it surprisingly ended up making it
worse you have problems with things I
oh yeah I also have suffered from that
but I'm curious have you found something
that's helped you how long have you been
suffering from anxiety longer in
hindsight than I thought when I was in
high school sophomore year I was in the
in the hospital with stomach problems
thinking uh I just like I did like you
know drank Barry I'm thinking I'm having
all this like of holes in my intestines
and I was just nervous [ __ ] my pants
it's funny I find it interesting that
you weren't aware mmm that it was
anxiety you were feeling well it was so
constant that we I didn't think it could
have been it was every day um which
actually probably should have pointed to
anxiety but but um and then it really
when I was 23 I had my first panic
attack
on stage and then that was like oh she
how did you how did the show continue it
continued I've had like you know you
push through it
yeah I've had about ten on stage and
[ __ ] what happens in that moment you
become like very self-aware tunnel
vision like tunnel vision and then like
you know numb body and then if just a
total like out-of-body feeling and
what's so weird
what's so weird about it is that it's
with it's it's happening within the
structure of a show that is written out
- but - the word you mean sort of like I
can't even like go I'm feeling like I
have to I have to like say so it ends up
like a I'm in Groundhog's Day and I like
or like I have a script they have to
keep - so I have this inner monologue
freaking out and then I'm having to
perform by ground that you're able to
still like perform the script while
having a somewhat out of body experience
yeah I was but it was like it was like
I'd be a little out of breath so I'd be
the the entire show for 20 minutes would
be existing like on like the inhale kind
of um it was definitely was my best work
you know
do you remember for me my anxiety I
think I was diagnosed with like
generalized anxiety disorder and I had
like a very specific moment of like
almost breaking like a breaking point
where it just came out of nowhere did
you have a moment like that it was
actually it I had a panic attack in it
in Providence Rhode Island
which is funny cause like you know I've
taught like people who went
she'll have heard this now don't you
know I don't think my parents were there
and couldn't tell what's happening mmm
Providence Rhode Island it was like a
theater like 3,000 people had a panic
attack was really bad then went to New
York had three shows had a panic attack
in the middle show went to see the
Martian the next day and got very very
angry because it wasn't about anxiety
and I didn't know it felt like so
perfect for my life like how is this
story about a guy alone on Mars locked
and it felt so true to me and then it
was just like about how he's like a good
botanist or something he movies probably
chill I was just in the bad place and
then I had a panic attack on the train
to DC mmm the next day um which was
another show and I had like this was
like the first week of a tour that was
like 45 shows and 50 days and that was
when I was like there's something going
on here yeah like this is bad and I can
never do this again um that that that
was the worst time of my I've had a
pretty fortunate life that was
definitely one of the hardest yeah
stretches of my life and and like how
did you kind of get through it I mean
did you find at the time was it like for
me it was almost unbearable like I
couldn't even live I was completely
debilitated for like six months I would
say try meditation you know I've been
meditating for [ __ ] the problem is
there's just a show every night and
there was like very like surreal comical
things right be like googling how to
deal with stage fright you know before
show in front of 3,000 people and the
answers would be like don't worry like
if you're if you're doing this in front
of your class or at Town Hall like
people don't really write about what
you're saying no no no there's 3,000
people that have paid $40 in or have
waited you know like it is they do care
yeah it like really helped me to find
out that like Barbra Streisand prays
mm-hmm Adele like I get actually really
helped well it's such a weird thing like
how you almost have to be more of a
[ __ ] psycho to not experience anxiety
exactly like it's like being the
president like I don't know how you well
I I've long held that you have to be an
actual sociopath that even want to be
President
yeah so those guys don't feel like yeah
I just feel cold-blooded yeah we got a
good one right now but yeah they're
usually pretty bad yeah he's I I get the
he's not having much self-awareness
self-aware moments right now yeah yeah
no um yeah my Mac I know my body's on
fire
[Music]
welcome
one and all
to the h3 podcast
[Music]
experience how was that that looked
pretty good well lightning
experience
we got super powers over here this is a
[ __ ] experience i don't see joe
rogan's podcast
lighting up
with a reverb and lightning bolts hell
no
feeling good
thank you to quip dollar shave club and
fortnite
for sponsoring this episode of the h3
podcast guys we started late today
because my day
so far has been pretty messed up
oh my god dude what happened
so
having breakfast this morning you know
getting ready for the day
and um i see shredder
on his little bed
next to the breakfast table chewing on
this weird little blue thing
and i'm like what the hell is that
what does what a shredder gotten himself
into
and he's like he's the pickiest eater in
the world he doesn't eat anything but
this little thing of course he'd eat
this
and i pick it up and what i end up
seeing i thought it was like maybe a
piece of detergent or something but what
ended up being was a freaking adderall
pill
that was like
covered in plastic
and he was like munched like halfway
through it
so i'm online looking up like what is
this i'm like it's adderall who
who the hell left adderall on my floor
so i call the vet and the vet says call
poison control poison control's like
well he's a little guy and the amount
that he ate pretty much crosses right
over the line of being toxic
so
they're like you need to take him to the
vet immediately
and induce vomiting and shove charcoal
down his throat and i'm looking at this
sweet little guy by the way shredder
who's
the light of my life
besides ela
you know whoops
and
and i'm like dude this guy's gonna go
through like the craziest day
they're gonna go pump his freaking
stomach so i get in the car because he
he seems fine he just basically ate a
bunch of crack which is what adderall is
so i'm in the car driving on the way to
the vet he seems fine at halfway there
he starts shaking
and like crying
and he's confused he's like panicked and
it's like apparent that the drug had had
started affecting him
and i'm and i'm like crying because i'm
so freaking
scared for my little guy
and ela's out of the country out of the
country with her family it's uh
anyway we get to the vet he's fine they
pump his stomach he's fine he's a sweet
little guy point is sorry i'm late
my little guy almost went though i don't
know if i can handle that
i think that would just break you man
well yeah i was talking to ila about it
and she's like if anything happened to
shredder i swear to god i i couldn't
handle that
she's like i couldn't handle it i know
what i do because she's over there
taking care of her of her father who's
sick right now
anyway he's fine
yeah but who walks around
with an adderall
in their pocket
just free
flying just free flying in the pocket
any small creature that comes across it
the vet said when he puked they found
the the pill was blue and they found all
these little blue specks like a ton of
the drug in his stomach she said it's a
good thing you brought him right away
because he puked it out
and he he i think he would have died
certainly if i didn't catch him eating
it right away he would have died
crazy
so anyway
so that's about that that's why we're
late
i don't know if that was an interesting
story but i'm i was i was
very upset but he's okay now
and i'm also i'm the wizard of
loneliness this week because ela is gone
she's back helping her family
and i am truly the wizard of loneliness
shredder was gone with my parents the
other day and i was just sitting there
damn
cast loneliness on myself
level 99
but anyway i'm here to entertain and
that is what i shall do
next friday is the great and wonderful
bo burnham which we are all super
excited to meet and chat with him and
we're going to talk about his amazing
film that's coming up very excited about
that
but we've got a lot to get to today
we've got the tanacon con
it took me a while to wrap my head
around the tanacon thing this was like
a roller coaster of fraud
the thing about tanacon i've seen a lot
of people talking about it
the thing that kind of surprised me most
about it
i'm not a lawyer i have dealt with a lot
of legal stuff though is that i'm like
damn like they're off being like yeah i
[ __ ] up
but a lot of people aren't acknowledging
that
it seems to be criminal fraud
like straight up like the fbi
might want to say what up to her
in a couple weeks from now
i want to get into that but first let's
break the ice because
i've got a clip that might be the best
thing i've ever seen
i'm just going to pop that up there get
the mood set get the feeling right
man being in the trenches solo is a
[ __ ]
brutal dude
but here we go
no sound oh there's no sound on this
so this is there's no sound on this
right then
i don't know so basically what you're
seeing is there's a
i think they were shoplifting
right they're shoplifting and they try
to escape a police officer he brings her
to the down he brings her down they're
all kind of doing having a little orgy
there at the entrance
kind of just tussling around
so dude escapes from the police he's
running into the storage
the basically the back area where they
store all the sodi pops as you can see
now this video is so perfectly like shot
and set up and the twists and turns in
it he's throwing halls at the officer
the officer has a gun pointed at him
what does he do
he arms himself with a bag of halls
lost and well
i'm getting ahead of myself by the way
these police officer pants are kind of
gucci as [ __ ] they got nice taping down
the leg
it's pretty stylish how did she escape
this is in canada by the way if you need
to know if this was in america they'd be
[ __ ] bleeding dead on the floor in
canada this girl's just wandering around
you know what i mean there's two
officers and she's still wandering
around the store
anyway he's armed oh a little taser
there straight to the floor
did i miss the bat the oh yeah here this
[ __ ] arms himself with
what does it say
spritz
they look like a bag of peanuts
or something here you go
if you stick one step closer man
i'm gonna hit you with this bag of
peanuts
his threats sadly did not avail
as the officer
was was better armed than him sadly
so he's he's pretty much in submission
but nope he got a second one folks
he's got a second one
and his his
his wife is on the loose
and he he points to her and says back
the [ __ ] off [ __ ]
is what he said
now i yeah that that was a that was a
real spill i've wondered if this video
was fake but
that spill is real folks let me tell you
that was oh he's got his he's got his
knee right on his [ __ ] dick bone
there that ain't pretty
so the girl's gotta she's like you know
listen
the cop just need my boyfriend in the
dick he's probably impotent from now on
so she's like i don't have any much use
for this guy so i'm out of here
peace
she tries to sneak out and that's true
love folks
she's like he's [ __ ] i'm out of here
peace
there's the bag of uh spritz that was
thrown at the officer those are
those are evidence now
exhibit
c
dude this guy man
this officer
this is like a real test for him like
how do you stop a meth head
in canada it's a lot harder to to
enforce the law when you don't have a
gun you know if this was america they
would have just executed that guy you'd
be done
this would be a short video kind of sad
because instead of having like a
wonderful
almost three stooge ask video to enjoy
it would just be like
drugged homeless man was shot dead
by florida you know
but instead we've got this wonderful
little and it gets better folks stay
tuned
i love the effort by this officer though
he's like you will not [ __ ] escape me
meanwhile back at the ranch
his uh his wife having decided to
divorce him is looking for an escape
room she goes to the ceiling
desperation my god now this is like dude
how the hell
did they capture this so perfectly
that's what makes me suspicious of it
being fake like you even get the ass
shot in there and the spandex and not
saying that's something that interests
me
just simply stating that
it is quite an opportunistic shot well
where is she where'd she go
let's find out
having a tussle and then suddenly
look who's back
that's right
the girlfriend
she's back
she's back ladies and gentlemen
and aren't we so glad that the canadian
police force in this very moment aren't
armed and we can enjoy
this video
the way she pops back up too is just so
beautiful she dude they must be drugged
out of their mind because she just was
like
shrugs it off like it's nothing let's
get in let's get a let's get a slow
definitely let's go to quarter speed on
this one shall we
so as you can see she's crawling around
the attic space trying to look for an
out
and um
maybe maybe she had second doubts maybe
she said you know what i do love
uh
oh you think she she was trying to do
like an aerial assault
yeah she's trying to help out but
not quite
not quite
there's tennis balls rolling all over
the place
man she was just unharmed what whatever
they're on i'll have one please
christ i could use a little
invincibility in my life i could barely
go up my stairs in the evening
but be that as it may she's not wearing
shoes either which i think is
interesting to point out oh no she is
well she's missing one shoe
she is missing one shoe which is
definitely worth pointing out
i wonder if she's heading on over to the
peanut bags to try to defend her
boyfriend
stuck up on the ammo
stack up on ammo she's like listen
i listen i don't know the guy
i didn't do anything man
yeah
okay and then then then the real
the real mf show up and and put an end
to this rodeo but wasn't that a thrill
wasn't that a thrill ladies and
gentlemen
truly a gift from canada
and i just really want to reflect one
more time on and enjoy the fact that
they are armed with tasers and not
live maybe they are i don't know but
they didn't shoot them so cheers to that
yeah what a thrill that's a beautiful
thing man
it's like do you see what i'm saying
though it's almost so perfectly arranged
right
that that i'm very i am so much
suspicious but the way they eat [ __ ] you
really can't fake that right like i mean
like how do you fake that that's
that's a real spell
how do you fake that holy [ __ ] she can't
she she's she takes back to school
shopping sales
very seriously
that face when uh
that face when school paper is 50 off
me once when school supplies are 50 off
you know
let's see that again
really can't get enough one more for
posterity this is totally me
when i see that am pm has a special on
school supplies
this is me
they're watching that all week and it
still cracks me up
well cheers to them you know what nobody
was hurt nobody was murdered it was a
beautiful oh it's just every once in a
while you get a video that's just so
so perfect
all right well now that we now got that
out of the way
we should move on
to the tanacon
now i know a lot of you guys probably
been following the tanacon thing i think
a lot of people have talked about it by
now so
i don't want to get too much into the
the nitty-gritty honestly what i was
trying to do because i was going through
all this information last night
and and the and the preceding week
was just to understand like what the
hell happened
so i kind of have things bullet pointed
i've got video clips i got pictures
and
and i think
there's there's a lot of interesting
stuff in here but most importantly
well let's start from the beginning okay
let's start here
i this is a riveting story by the way
this whole thing is just absolutely
fascinating and i haven't said
fascinating in a while and trust me when
i say that i mean
fascinating fascinating do that up quick
so she so tana was pissed that vidcon
hadn't given her featured creator badge
in previous years
so she wasn't having that
so she decided to start her own
convention that was inclusive for
everyone that's what she kept pressing
is that it was inclusive
for everybody she saw these vip passes
that said featured creators on them
it's like what every person there is a
featured creator featured [ __ ]
creator actually oh it actually said
[ __ ] i believe that
the actual official name is featured
[ __ ] create
that is so [ __ ] cool
um but it's like dude yeah let's be real
she sold 5 000 tickets and they are all
featured creators let's be real there's
only one featured creator at tanacon
it's tana
she wasn't there apparently
um so tana decides to throw a con to
rival vidcon with like 30 to 45 days to
plan it all right so here here's the
original invite from
the production company called good times
which a lot of good info about these
boys but let's start with this welcome
creators
we are so thrilled for you to be part of
the first ever tanacon good times is a
family that celebrates the online
community we are so honored to be
hosting this event we truly believe that
each of you here is equipped
are equipped with so many talents and
passions to lead a revolution tone it
down doug
you're you're charging 65 for a vip
ticket it's not a revolution
through the social media world that
fosters a vibrant inclusive and
world-changing environment
i hate this whole sentiment of like
everybody's a featured [ __ ] creator
you're all youtube superstars there it's
actually really exploitive because you
know every kid these days wants more
than anything to be a youtuber
at my con
everybody's a featured [ __ ] creator
for 65
this event is pioneering the change that
we are community wish to see in this
industry oh yeah we definitely need more
more tanacons
we strive to make this a community where
everybody feels seen heard understood
and most importantly included
don't they understand it in a world
where everybody's included it's like
you don't exist tana
when everybody's like equal and everyone
has the same talents and appeal it's
like you don't exist
it's so disingenuous
everyone is a featured [ __ ] creator
so with that being said [ __ ] vidcon
[ __ ] the current ceo
is this voice working for you is it
cringy
i mean it's no more cringier than her
voice that's
[ __ ] everyone
who created vidcon
and if you want to know why tanacon
became a thing and that's why
all the love
all right
this is a great genesis of like a great
mission statement it's so phony dude
it's the phoniest [ __ ] ever you're all
featured creators
i gotta tell you i
you guys probably know so we don't
really post videos on h3 anymore i just
i'm so like
well there's a lot of reasons why we're
but
one of the big reasons just like man i
just i really just can't watch
everything on youtube it's just
i don't know man it's all gotten so
tana it's like all tana

you know we talked about this recently
[ __ ] I think they almost have 200
million people on Netflix out it's like
over half the country so I did I know
yeah it's crazy so I did like a year and
a half ago they had a party for a
hundred million subscribers I was half a
year ago no a year like a year and a
half ago oh my god they're growing that
and and they were like they they hit my
manager and they were like just Chris
want to perform for the party I was like
no it's gonna be a [ __ ] train wreck
but I was like yeah I'm not gonna say no
what's your hesitation
you're performing to just the Netflix it
was like hey well it yeah and friends
and people that were invited to the
party it's a special event but it's just
like it's just I knew just any time as a
comedian that people are like you want
to perform it this thing that's not in a
comedy club right you're like okay so
I'm not gonna be right it's not gonna be
amazing you know but so so I was like
why I don't wanna say no to them and I
love Netflix so and I work for them so I
was like yeah I'll [ __ ] do it you
know and we made a fun it was fun it was
me and three other comedians cannot
remember who one of the other comedians
were that's how it was a crazy yeah but
it was it was it was fun we made it fun
it was like in this room off to the side
where other bands were playing to so we
like you heard your yeah crazy was like
knows how to party I know how they do it
was huge it was huge and we were doing
it was like it brought them back to the
Open Mic days when I was doing like I
would play bowling alleys that doesn't
sound nice I mean dude you play I play I
play bowling alleys that where like you
would compete with people who were
bowling in between pants at a time like
the punish line in between like after
they are right before they it would go
quit the business is that the worst show
you've ever done you know the bowling
alley
no no what's the worst I ever did I
talked about it and incorrigible is when
well the worst kind of like show coming
up that I did was where a lady rushed
the stage and it was because she was
heckling me and I said to her she had
like this really like wild hair that was
like really up and out and I and I
called her Blanca after she was like you
know faithful fighter yeah course I do
and she I was like I don't even know
she's gonna know what this means and I
did and she knew what it meant she was
very she or Ana right up and grabbed the
microphone well hit my face I pushed it
into my face and I was like oh god I
gotta say of all of the insults that
would cause someone to attack you the
Street Fighter reference yeah pretty
special one it's a good one and it just
kind of proved my point because I feel
like that's kind of
Blanka would have done get you some of
those sparks ya-ya-ya-ya-ya likes to get
you fast oh yeah
meeting my it was that one where he ate
the guy's head right of course
hey whatever she would have done that
yeah are you we I realize we've been
podcasting for about the same really
time because you this is what episode is
the monney 70 71 71 so I'm on like I
think I'm on 74 so yeah in about three
weeks or yeah three week different I'm
curious how is podcasting like affected
your stand-up in a way yeah it kind of
it's been really actually it's been
really interesting because I you know I
started a podcast after I had a
following right right and yeah would you
guys did too so and and I did so I was
like look I'm just gonna do this and see
how long it lasts you know everyone's
got a part I felt like you know I really
found out through other comedians that
if you don't have a podcast and you
already have a fanbase you're leaving
money on the table
yeah so also beyond that it's just a
great way to connect but I didn't think
of it that way until I started doing it
I was like you know I was like oh no I
want to make money more money and [ __ ]
it you know and then and then I realized
once I started doing it how much like I
mean in a much smaller way for me at
least it's like you know it's like a TV
like the TV SH the when you when people
are watching a TV show and they're like
I gotta wait till next week to watch the
next evey show which we a lot of the
little binge watch now but when I was a
kid that's how people used to watch TV
and now people feel connected and they
wait for the you know they feel like
they know me more yeah most and they do
yeah because I'm you know me or a
version of me on that comedy comedy
podcast you know and but yeah it really
like makes them feel like they know you
and that's kind of a double-edged sword
sometimes you like in sometimes you
don't but but but it it it as as I might
have my opener when he says you guys
listen to congratulations before he
brings me up the cheers have just gotten
bigger and bigger bigger throughout the
whole past year yeah it's really crazy
it's really crazy your podcast is
different than ours
that you're just it's you and you're
talking I mean how was that experience
from going from stand-up to just like
talking into a camera and nobody's there
cuz you do shows you act a lot right but
was that a different skill to learn or
did it kind of translate I you know what
it's it's it's like stayin up in the way
that like stand up to me is a version of
making like when I'm at a diner with my
friends late night I'm sometimes like
you know doing jokes I mean we're always
joking around messing around but like
sometimes I'm just [ __ ] with them and
we're just making jokes and we're doing
bits or whatever I always felt like
before I did stand-up I was like if I
could get to be onstage and treat the
audience like they're the other people
in the diner then I'll be able to do I
know I'll be able to do it because I'd
literally would do that every day of my
life I'm obsessed with trying to may be
able laugh and like trying to and and
and think about what do I think it's
funny what's funny about this situation
and so for podcasting it was the same
thing except it except like it when I'm
in my house and I'm with my dogs like
I'll catch myself just like talking
about things for no reason like I'm a
[ __ ] insane person and then and then
I'm like oh maybe I'll say that on my mi
in my show or my act or whatever but
then when I started to do the podcast I
was like oh this is just that this is
just like me talking out loud in my
house yeah and I kind of do that anyway
I don't do a probable hour like I'm an
insane person but like that's how I come
up with material I just start like
talking in my house and I uh I think oh
that's funny and giver this is material
born from your podcast ever does
anything start and the podcast and then
goes - yeah it has for sure yeah yeah
that's awesome yeah I did yeah well it
also helps me like creatively because I
don't like sit down and like write at
the computer my hack so like yeah
because when you do your act is it very
much rehearsed mmm for me I'll go up
with an idea that I have and when you do
man on fire yeah just like yeah yeah
well that's that's the act that I've
been kind of honing right okay right but
all obeah but all of those bits came
from
me going on stage thinking like oh it's
funny when guys work out I'll go on
stage and start talking about it that's
mom that's a wild way to approach it to
kind of just go up there and be like
alright let's see what's yeah I mean I
think I think though like so much of it
is about like that's what I say if I go
back going back to like being in a diner
with my friends I'm so comfortable with
them they're my friend this time do you
know what I mean yeah and and I think
through years and years of practice and
through the thousands and thousands of
shows yeah
I'm able to get into that headspace
onstage you know that's awesome
so I and I love it I love doing it and
it's you know it there's an old saying
like it's not what you say it's how you
say it
and and you know I think it is if you're
that confident and I mean like there's
guys who my buddy Bryan Callen it goes
onstage she talks about horseshit for an
hour and it's hilarious yeah and it's
not true but he acts like it is and it's
it's you know yeah so it's those guys
were the I mean you know guys like that
just it's about how you say it that's
cool
I think that's a cool way to just hone
the skill just get in the [ __ ]
gauntlet and yeah and get it down and
it's a one time dude one time I was on a
plane I [ __ ] you not man if somebody
told me this I wouldn't have I wouldn't
believe that but it happened to me and I
know it happened to me and it's true
because I know that because I witnessed
it this almost sounds like a lie yeah I
know part of it is because I have to I
have to convince myself it actually huh
okay it's it's not nobody's [ __ ] on the
plane or anything like that but it's
like so I'm we're gonna Montreal which
is a big festival in Montreal Just for
Laughs I'm doing it again this year but
I went and they fly us up there and
whenever you fly up there since it's a
stand up festival it's comedy festival
there's always like nine comedians on
your flight right she's sitting there
with you know Sebastian Tom Segura bill
burr whoever the [ __ ] and you see a
Chelsea Handler oh hey you know so Adam
Carolla's sitting behind me I know I
know Adam you know I say hey he sits
behind me and he doesn't know there's
another comedian behind me and I meet
him and
Adam didn't know him so Adam Carolla is
sitting next to this other comedian this
is the two seats I'm in front of him and
the flight to Montreal from LAX is six
hours okay and Adam Carolla
I'm telling you did not stop talking to
that kid for longer than no exaggeration
30 seconds now you were watching this
with like more of a curiosity in the
beginning I was like and I kind I know
Adam and I loved at him and he's great
at those pockets all the time and and
he's [ __ ] hilarious
and I was like when's this guy gonna
freakin take a break yeah dude
he he didn't he didn't take a break he
didn't take a break the other kid didn't
talk it was just like yeah yeah and then
first hour I was like man he's bent over
an hour and I'm [ __ ] magic and I was
like I'm gonna I'm gonna stay listening
because I have to I have to find out
when he takes a break right I have to
like see how long and he didn't
dude land he landed and I was like this
[ __ ] and was he talking off the
plane it kept going yeah he never
stopped he never signed a kid the new
kid who was on the road you know who
that was hey did you catch a glance in
his eye no no not while it was going on
maybe I did I was there was anything
interesting you know every was all
interesting that's something Adam
Carolla is so good at that and he was
talking about stuff and I was like man
this guy's did it's like he had thought
about everything already that ever
happened right and he's like if you say
target if the guys like yeah q-tips is
like well you know guys just amazing at
it so so when you're in that comfortable
space where you can just I'm saying like
Corolla didn't even need that kid to be
sitting there okay and it was
interesting if you just talk for six
hours I could be like alright I would
listen yes he's a conduit of comedy yeah
it's always challenge so you know and
I'm not saying I'm as good as that but I
you know to get into that comfortable
space to where you can just talk which
is what we do as comedians so I feel
like it was a version of that and I just
had to work through a few episodes and
then I kind of I think figured it out
after like the third episode I was like
oh I can do I really expected to do
about three or four episodes
and then just chalk it up as a as a loss
but well guys check it out
74 now so we'll keep going god bless
imma listen so I want I know you've
probably talked about this so many times
but we've talked about on the podcast
yeah and Logan Paul yeah hit me with
that echo Logan Paul alright we missed
Logan Paul shot it because we got that
he's he's something we've talked about a
lot oh yeah yeah yeah I saw you guys
sell and we talked about it and it's
like he's I feel like that exchange
really showed what a [ __ ] dumb ass he
is or maybe even just like how damaged
he is from the hole yeah suicide forest
yeah I want to go over it with yeah yeah
if you don't mom happy - yeah I want to
go over this and and I want to get your
thoughts on some of these twitter
exchanges okay yeah well first of all
I'm curious your initial interaction
when he said it's important that you
want right no it's not right now how did
Logan Paul come on your radar to begin
with because you were following you are
ready yeah I don't know if I was fault I
may have been following him but I think
actually I just maybe saw it because
he's so dumb you know what I mean yeah
so I probably just responded to it maybe
I follow him I don't know but so I just
write no it wasn't because because of
the suicide forest yeah great that
wasn't yeah and how everywhere that was
yeah that well yeah that was just bad
but and so I just wrote no it wasn't
because like a shot of dead body in the
forest land this is important man no
wasn't so it's less I was trolling him
and more that I was just reacting off of
that right and I just thought I didn't
think anything of it I just yeah it's
and then but when he responded and let
me pull this up actually because this
was like damn dog really [ __ ] try to
make this work the tsunami of Brian yeah
[ __ ] like what did you think when you
saw that wave of yellow and blue I was
really confused because I thought it was
a fake I was like this is not him I saw
the check yeah I was like okay so I
guess that is
and then I thought that's so many emoji
he's so [ __ ] amused yeah like that's
laughing for a long time that's not that
yeah that's like it's not funny anymore
yeah that's like the first two rows it's
getting a little sad yeah yeah yeah
after two rows you're like oh [ __ ] man
maybe he's just mentally imbalanced
because that's why he thought it was
okay to shoot somebody and then when he
said and then I read it wrong I first
read it I'm laughing because I know why
your comedy career took a dive and not I
didn't read I'm laughing because now I
know why you're coming so I thought he
knew something I didn't know and I was
like this is Garrison what did I do that
I don't know that's bad right that's
that's so much about me like I'm like
did I do something like my head is like
because it's such a stupid comment you
almost want to believe that it's like oh
my god does he actually know is there
something else right like yeah yeah like
did he send me your illiterate person
first response then no it's not was so
not like deserving of anything more than
just just just Leon just yeah just like
a [ __ ] off or whatever the [ __ ] it's so
personally like with that response yeah
also what is it in your response that
you know educated him so now what like
why your comedy career took a dive like
there wasn't that much information
encoded my initial response right yeah
yes is that now I know because I wasn't
trying to make a joke yeah just like
saying something yeah we saw that that's
it that's I guess like in comedy like
you'd say what he did was fundamentally
flawed right but another thing that's
fundamentally and I was listening to
Bert Kreischer talk about this too and
and this sounds defensive and this is
why I have not said this until now my
comedy career has not taken a dive right
it's it everyone's been more and more
clearly a wounded child but what Bert
was saying and he's right there needs to
be some kind of true
in your burn or roast or spam what if
you want to call it so I was like oh I
was like oh and so I read all that and
then I read it correctly it's like I'm
laughing because I knew why I now I know
why you're coming to her
oh yeah he's trying to act like I was
trying to joking with him yeah so then
I'm kind of I I honestly went right to
feeling badly right because I was like
well you might have realized you're
dealing with a child but well he's 24
though right
but that intellectually like how can you
write that and not have the intellect of
a much younger person that's true but
even further than that here's here's the
thing like if you're gonna write to
somebody who I write to people oh dude
this is fun for me
right I like to [ __ ] clap back and
[ __ ] like that yes to me I'm bored and
people are like why do you take it
personally I don't it's just fun I like
doing it my whole thing is if you say
something to me and you got your 14
followers and you think nobody's gonna
see it dude I can't wait I can't I want
to imagine the look on your face when I
read you this is your game really I I
love that philosophy so fun
yeah people don't appreciate the [ __ ]
that you get when you're online like oh
Jesus Christ and I love when you do that
they get mad at you like you should have
known better
yeah but they're brilliant on black yes
yeah and it's like dude Oh waiter oh hey

plus eight enter it could be yours
today's guest needs no introduction the
great boogie2988 is back here with us
say last time you were here almost
exactly a year ago we had an amazing and
you have since then basically when you
were here previously you were just about
to undergo gastric bypass I was it was
June last year and then I got surgery
the second week of August
and now I'm down a hundred eighty pounds
180 pounds where did you start before
you wanted to circus ever five four well
because there was six hundred pounds but
just before surgery he Laurie started
the liquid diet was 540 yeah well yeah
and our doubts like three I guess I'm
not doing my math exactly I don't know
if it's a hundred eighty about down to
three sixty five sixty three sixty Wow
I got on the plane but I'm still
monumentally fat like I am tremendously
huge right I'm way more than both guys
who live in towns is right that's how
much that way so I've still got a long
ways to go I my doctor wants me to lose
another seventy five and then just get
right under 300 and then we got a lot of
skin to remove which we I like it's so
bad like I look like naked I look like
the Michelin Man blew a tire I look like
the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man
after the Ghostbusters movie I look like
the Elephant Man but only from the neck
down because it's so bad so at what
point during the weight loss do you say
okay I'm gonna remove the skin like
because yeah I know you want to lose
more right so they don't like to do it
within the first couple years they want
the skin to like shrink as much as it
can like tighten up and like they want
to make sure you got as much fat out of
there as you can right because it makes
it easier like cauterize and stuff and
at first I told them I don't want to do
that I'm not interested like this who
cares about this right right you know
okay it looks like I have a flying
squirrel I don't have a shed but there's
the chest and like this underbelly the
actual Fupa Fupa king I am still
undisputed it's like so uncomfortable
and it makes a difficult exercise and
makes it really so the skin gets in the
way yeah it's like straight up in the
way and so it does it's not gonna be
like that for everybody some people my
size or smaller don't have that problem
some people my size who are younger
don't have that problem but since I was
in my 40s and yes it's a real issue I
like the the nurse she's like so we'll
schedule that for the consultation or
the one-year mark and I'm like for the
plastic surgeon I'm not gonna get that
[ __ ] you know you trust me you're gonna
want it and then at the four month mark
I was like oh I really want that well
bad god bless I mean good problem to
have
yeah it's a good problem to have yeah I
I don't know it's just it's weird like
they talked about body dysmorphia and
you hear that term a lot would like for
people who're trans and stuff and I
didn't I was like
that's not a thing that I could
experience but like I was really looking
at old photos I took all my old photos
down I couldn't stand to look at him
right YouTube recommends one of my older
videos I'm like who is that guy I don't
even look like so what is the body
dysmorphia part because isn't that when
you like see yourself in a way that
you're not right so I still see myself
with like five hundred six and five okay
you don't see yourself any different
then I used I'll look at a street corner
and I'll think I can't walk to that but
I know I can now we're all like I'll be
putting on one of my shirts I'm down to
a 4x now this is like a six this has
fallen off me but I'll put on a 4x shirt
and I'm sliding it on I'm like oh this
is not going to over my body but it does
or like I'm walking through a restaurant
or a store and I'm like I can't fit down
that I it's just a actual disconnect
right with reality and like is that
affecting your yeah your continued
weight loss efforts
well they've not has been as great as I
would like nice I stalled right about I
stalled right about the control board
you yeah so you can sit back I sold
right about like 375 for a while and
then I started doing some pretty big
cuts to get down to like about a pound a
loss oh wait so I don't know like I your
listeners may not know right after I got
this surgery made my ex wife divorced
hmm and like you guys didn't know about
it until December but we had talked
about it for the first time in July and
then we made the agreement like we'll
get the surgery done and see what it's
like after the surgery but she was ready
to go and I was still like bleeding
really I was not even remotely recovered
I wasn't able to stand up I wasn't even
really cook for myself so they were
clean it was it was it was youthful I
mean it omma it's probably hard not to
be upset and to feel like a bandit in a
way because it seems like you were
vulnerable and and that's what I like
the timing sucked but yeah right I mean
what you were saying you went through a
divorce like life-changing weight loss
of a really intense surgery all within
the scope of three months by god I get
this like Fight Club mentality about it
like just like let's just burn it down
yeah and just start over like let's just
completely rebuild who and what I mean
you have nothing to lose exact just
[ __ ] right and so I told a therapist
actually lost my therapist over this
conversation but I'm a your pistol can
leave right here they're like I don't
want to work with you anymore because I
got the wrong idea in your head and I
think it was the right idea but she
disagreed entirely but I'm like so I
know that I made that happen that
doesn't seem very professional they're
like you know what you're too [ __ ] up
that's
I'm not a good fetes what they say it's
like it's not you it's not that's what
they gave me but I'm like buddy that
feel getting dropped by the shrink it
sucked but I just moved on to the next
one because it happens like sometimes
you're a good fit sometimes you're not
it's like anything else in there and if
you don't have a good therapist you're
not a good fit with that person that's
really hard we were really good fit for
real on top of the conversation I had
with her I'm like so I realized right
now I have to be miserable I've gone
through a divorce and divorces are
miserable you can write and I can't I'm
physically in pain all the time and I
can't rely on my one favorite thing in
the world which is food mm-hmm so I
can't drink I can't smoke I can't do it
I can't like shoot cocaine I can't do
anything mm-hmm I have no recourse so
I'm just gonna have to push through the
physical pain I'm gonna have to push
through the emotional pain I'll have to
I'm not gonna try to go back to an
addicts State of Mind and just try to
avoid it and try to deal with it and
like go back in a stupid bad habits cuz
I'm gonna get addicted to painkillers
I'm gonna get addicted to food again I'm
gonna poison myself you know um and I'm
like I just have to accept that I have
to be miserable for a while to do the
works like I mean not miserable in the
future right and she's like there's a
very destructive attitude you can't
think that way a sense to me right and
it was like what was what was it's like
if you choose to be miserable right now
you're gonna end up going back to old
habits what you need to do is you need
to start finding the joy in your daily
life and like under there isn't any
right there isn't to me this is just the
worst six months of my life and I just
have to deal with it yeah and I'm so
glad because now I'm out the six months
and I've went through the physical
therapy and I went through the divorce
and you know I've dated a little bit and
yeah yeah that was weird
how'd you meet him tinder believe it or
not yeah it's real so wait after how
long of being together so me me my
ex-wife were together for four seven
years Oh married for four and so that
was tough and so like every girl that
I've met on tinder I did the opposite of
like try to woo them I was like so
here's the thing I just went through a
divorce and I also got gastric bypass
surgery I I look like I'm melting
physically my problem my brain is on
fire but I'm not looking to get into a
relationship or nor do I ever want to be
one and again I plan to die alone
would you like me can we no Marvel movie
with me because that's all I want a just
want somebody goes to the Marvel movie
with you you like Marvel movies let's go
see Marvin yeah I can go with my friends
that's fine so you said no not a fad
right it's not and so like a the biggest
thing is is you know I'm not a
good-looking guy you know I have like
all seven teeth so like the girls are
not physically like excited but like
they know me from YouTube that's what's
been been a big part of it they're like
well I know you you helped my cousin you
helped my my brother you helped me so
you've gone on her ample dates to the
movies yeah and as anything is there new
special there was one girl who seems
like two and a half months and that was
fun and she was really nice but just
wasn't a great fit like she wanted more
that I could like provide because I
understand like emotionally there yeah I
was too busy like done with XY stuff and
all that stuff so that was kind of nice
but yeah it's just I don't know a it I
don't know it I don't know if I'll ever
like trust again like that's a stupid
thing to say but it's hard
ya know but like at the same time like I
have I'm not really angry my ex-wife and
I don't really feel like I should be
because we weren't happy right sure you
know and like that VidCon I've never
said this elsewhere and this is the only
place I would ever say this that last
VidCon not just because the Anita
sarkeesian your was that when you were
here yes like we meet get me my ex-wife
were at our worst during that VidCon
traveling was so bad we were having like
an unhappy time in the hotel and an
unhappy time in the car owner what here
it was a brick wall let me I want to say
I want to say something yeah you were
here almost a year ago you're here with
your ex-wife yeah and when you came here
it was a such a struggle for you to
physically walk in here you were taking
breaks yeah you could you came you sat
here because you couldn't really write
like we talked about
we took the little intermission you guys
got up and walked around and I literally
sit here and look at my phone you know I
had to piss because I couldn't write but
I'll say this
yeah can you pull those pictures up this
time you walked in on by yourself you're
slamming around you stood up and took a
photo here as well like this was the one
before you couldn't get up so we went
over to that side and took the photo so
hard look here's the news so hard
looking at these older pictures for me I
really
but it does it not here blow that up a
little bit and this one [ __ ] we did
it in that goddamn iconic spot yeah and
that's look you look great man that's a
that's a really good photo I'm getting
there
you know like I don't know most people
in they lose weight they look younger
and I'm getting older because you know
like fat doesn't crack is the joke right
and so like I started to see the crows I
don't agree by the way why do you what
do you what do you feel sad when you
look at the old photo of you because I
to me I know the state I was in mentally
and I was just like defeated and I
didn't care to fight like the morbid
obesity and I was trying like to get my
brain around it and to want to do it and
want to be healthy and want to be better
but I just didn't give a [ __ ] on some
level and that's why I just couldn't
push myself thing every licked right and
like the surgery I mean that was what is
like physical rehab like being forced
rehab surgical rehab what was there a
moment or kind of a catalyst where
you're like you know what I need to like
you finally something click because you
on your by your own will lost what 60 80
pounds before you could even get this
right and and that was like I think I
think the testament is you have to
you're supposed to do a two-week
entirely liquid diet like 800 calories a
day for the first two weeks to prepare
your liver and drink calories right holy
crap you got to prepare your liver you
got to prepare your body for the surgery
and if you cheat on that diet and they
open you up and see that you didn't do
it then they will not do the surgery
whoa right that's serious
they just like alright you got him up
right patch him up we can't do it Wow
so going into that knowing that I'm like
you know how am I gonna do this I've
never been able to put down a fork in my
life how am I gonna do this and then I
just did it and what was it what was it
that I was dying like I was history you
felt it like mush I was like 240 over
210 sometimes like with the anxiety and
like the the physical stress I was in I
was taking wads and medication to keep
my blood pressure down and I was just
straight dying and my surgeon is like
ideally you would get all the way down
to 425 before we do anything mm and you
know doing it as such a larger size
means you're you're bottoming out will
be way higher than we want it to be you
know if we look at the bell curve and
you'll uh get into calculators less
you're gonna get down to 300 and that's
where you're gonna stop boogie and
that's just the math of it it'll take
incredible discipline for the rest of
your life to get done right and but if
we do it at 400 we'll get you down at
225 right
and I'm like [ __ ] okay but he's like we
have to do it now because you are dime
yeah so let's pull the trigger I want to
save your life because I know you'll pay
it forward so now it's been a little bit
of a time you've lost like 180 pounds
you said like physically how do you feel
like I mean it's been a since all this
stuff [ __ ] tag yeah it's got to feel
like you [ __ ] walked up here yeah
yourself I haven't felt this good since
I was 20 well and like I flew in 83 last
week and you know Jeff Healey the
YouTube team they put me on camera for
like five or six segments and I get to
host my own segment interview developers
is amazing
great opportunity couldn't have done
that otherwise but normally when I flew
into LA every time I've ever had to fly
in LA I needed fiscal assistance so if a
fan saw me they saw me in a [ __ ]
wheelchair get pushed by somebody last
VidCon you're in a wheelchair right robe
for part of it and I still my doctor
still wants me running the motor scooter
for these events but I just Park it and
I don't bring it anywhere and I don't do
anything but I have it it's like you
wanted in case he pulls back muscle at
AC you do Hayes case you go too far but
like I went to a fortnight event during
e3 and abandon the cart you know ten
miles back at the hotel and I was on my
feet for like two and a half hours and
much like marshmallow and that's amazing
and logic right I like a logic and
concert and like yeah I don't know it's
just like I can do that now and I want
to do it so I hate having to keep that
thing but I do use it a little bit at
these events just to be safe but are you
afraid like it's funny I was tough our
previous guest Tom Segura I was talking
to him about weight loss by every stand
a much different scale but he said
something I thought was what's funny but
very true he's like he used to be really
big and lost a ton of weight yeah I said
I always feel like I'm five days away
from completely relapsing I could see
that it was how do you feel about well
after the surgery do you feel like
you're super motivated to keep going or
you still feel like super motivated
right now but I talked to a lot of
people in a way I talked a lot of people
on on the subreddit I talked to a lot of
people on the Facebook groups you know
these these Recovery Group C surgery
groups and like I'm in several and
there's some people like one guy in my
area I don't want to doc some
um but he you know never allowed to
smoke again
because if you do you can perforate the
surgical scars in your stomach well and
so the smoker right he started smoking
again at the six-month mark and now it's
been a one year since the surgery and he
has perforated his stomach and so what
does that mean basically there's holes
in the surgical lining of his stomach
and so he's literally he eats when he
eats he's dumping stomach juices and
food so it's almost worse off right so
like the chances of him buying any day
is like happening and I'm like I'm
learning from him like how do you how do
you know why are you doing that I guess
I don't know it's a stress ring right
and you're you're under more stress than
you've ever been
yeah and and like you said I mean food
is is kind of always been something that
you've leaned on then the good news is
our cigarettes in his case the good news
is I will tell your audience that I've
told them before there were a couple of
times like right after the divorce I was
like you know what
um cake is delicious so I don't give a
[ __ ]
I'm ready cake mm-hmm and it made me
very very sick and maybe very very ill
because your summit but I'm so sick all
alive it's because like I just wasn't
used to those foods anymore I'm over it
right and so I like I'll push through it
because I'm really really dedicated to
looking this up I guess and so you're
saying you felt off on but you kept
eating right you know what man I'm gonna
eat this I'm gonna go back in a
self-destructive mode and do it and then
my stomach the surgery kicks in and it's
like hey boss you know we can only eat
about for us as a food still right and
like oh so that's why the surgery is so

things seem to be going really well for
you seeing you like more and more yeah
and it seems like things are happening
for Tom Segura if
it's been a it's been a good couple
years like with you know it's like
steady things moving along just happy to
be you know doing what I do yeah and
yeah the podcast is is is going along
and the touring has been has been great
so nice I feel very lucky you guys
Netflix started giving getting into
comedy was that a lot like a big
game-changer for you and other comedians
all for sure Ben cuz me when they pay
more you get more I got in what is
considered we're talking about how you
know Internet years are different than
real years yeah so that first one I did
completely normal I did I shot it in
2013 and getting on Netflix was like a
consolation prize hmm that's what like
people now can't even imagine that but
that was the goal was Comedy Central and
Comedy Central was that that was we shot
it in 2013 so five short years yeah and
when they when we shot it and try to
sell out something they were like and
there's not really a theme to it that
was their note yeah we were like I mean
his jokes that's the theme is I'm doing
stand-up the whole time and they were
like critical then I was kind of bummed
out about that you know that that it was
not going to because that was like the
place to be and then I know that I know
was sent to Showtime I remember it must
have been a pass and I don't remember
any note or anything and then I remember
getting the call they're like Netflix is
willing naked they're willing yeah like
they'll do it I'll do that favor and I
was like hmm and they go now it's great
like people watch it all the time you
know cuz it was still like I mean that's
only five years ago but I think that
streaming was still on an upswing people
are still getting DVDs in the mail from
them really oh yeah for sure I mean I
feel like 2012 I remember where I was
living and for sure we were doing DVDs
all the time Wow 2013 probably it's it's
hard to really grasp how much change in
five years I know in technology you know
that's light yeah it's just it's crazy
right it's it's it's so many years right
but then when it went up I didn't know
I remember doing clubs so I shot in 2013
they started streaming in early 2014 and
a few months after that like I sold out
of club one time and this guy was like I
remember the club manager goes I don't
know what the you did but a lot of
people came this week and I was so not
thinking of the effect of this special I
was like I don't know because like
months since I shot it and I was like I
don't know what people are here yeah and
then it just was like a slow and steady
increase from there so having the
exposure because Netflix now has like
half of every household in America it's
crazy now and actually have to say they
promote your for whatever I don't know
I've seen your disgraceful your new
stand-up on the home page almost every
time I so probably because they have you
know it's really a data company and they
study you so much and you should see
when you go a marketing meeting about
something you have coming out the way
that they market you differently in
every territory Wow
different colors different patents I'll
show you on the in your last special
more people clicked on this in Brazil
get all this data well they don't know
they don't provide Italy's give you an
example watch your no I
damn no they don't they don't give me
that interesting of course of
course I think this is great I think
you're you're downplaying yourself a
little bit because it's on trending now
when like popular on Netflix is is oh
really for a long time like in the top
five
oh that's really cool yeah it's been
it's been a fun ride with them for sure
I mean every you know from that time
2013 like which we said was not that
long ago to like now we're now they're
they're more even more selective and
shut people down and no and but and then
give into buying offers that's like 30
million he got 20 million per person for
I love how he balanced and then he came
back and he's like alright I'm
collecting all the money you out
man yeah and then sorry I forgot a
nine-figure deal he does any money so
yeah wait wait for their community wait
nine figures yeah yeah give yourself a
minute though wait for comedians hang up
really well Stefan is a Millie it's okay
hundred yeah under
Plus what so he's you don't need any
more money it's for comedians in cars
getting coffee I think he's gonna do the
special that came out last year another
special right and then another some type
of another original they bought it so
gramming yeah they gotta give us a bunch
of bye Ellen Ellen just got I think
50 she's doing a special I think
producing something else for them
I got like 250 million I was like whoa I
made less than those guys paying
Commission I mean they but they how did
they pay you like compared to what
you're doing before Oh
I mean look it's it's it's like for sure
I mean it's not like it's good it's not
that kind of it's not that kind of money
it's not even in the stratosphere
million isn't like aging that's just
like no even do with them I know I put
like you know the Seinfeld and those
guys money it's crazy yeah it's crazy um
yeah it's nothing like that and by the
way nor should it be like those guys are
it's not just like they're they're just
they're not just they're so famous but
that their origins like I you know some
people who get into the battle of like
what rate somebody gets like dude
they're bringing eyeballs their mother
for buying they're simply monopolizing
all these Titans yes nobody has any
other reason in 30 20 years maybe even
people are just gonna say hey it's and
people are gonna forget the cable and
television was a thing they'll be like
hey put on netflix yeah it's a it's from
an analytical standpoint it really is
interesting to see where will things go
you know we've had guests who are like
oh wow
why you play the whole show no no I see
but no just to see where it'll go
because you kind of go like you know no
one can compete with this with this
model of like paying this kind of money
right and then you know the platform you
know how many eyeballs are already there
it's like what what will happen at least
from stand-up standpoint you go I mean
is are the other competitors gonna do
something or just go that's what I'm
saying
behind on it yeah they're really behind
like from the viewer perspective nothing
can compete with it
okay I can see all the specials I don't
even have to go to a live show if I
can't you know it's you out there it's
all you put it whenever you want there's
no ads it's like yeah who can compete I
know and it's not that expensive it's
not what happened have 150 million
 subscribe giving them whatever
like 15 bucks a month and yeah it's a
lot of money man although they're like
spending all of it yeah yeah you know
crazy debt their their growth has been
unbelievable Warren Buffett I think was
Warren Buffett recently said he's like I
cannot buy enough Netflix or maybe sit
about Apple and I'm completely off-base
can you guys research that for me thank
you sure yeah there was one joke from
disgraceful yet I loved yeah and there's
a whole story around it which I loved
even more yeah the one bit that you had
that was so funny
was the one about how you can't say
 that's gay or anymore
uh-huh which is such a great bit because
we're actually are we're similar in age
I'm 32
like you're 39 right yeah you're much
younger we come well we come from a
world where we probably both were just
saying like that
I'm bombarded with it hearing it all
exactly that was just you know and and
and the world changed around us in a way
problem you know like happens every
generation sure but it's like they took
yeah that's what look hey you like love
that so but then when I found out that
people were actually made a petition
you've seen this oh yeah about there was
a group of people here it is on the
screen it has almost a hundred thousand
signatures I was looking at this last
night and it was going up before my eyes
which was cracking me up I'm like really
still going up go ahead pick up I was
going up as I was gonna go up right now
right we're live right I'm gonna get a
lot of meme signatures no yeah you're
right I mean I like I mean look it's I I
know all about this one of the things
about the transcription of the show
being in there is that it shows like
audience laughter it was like they're
including the people and by the way yeah
yeah I mean look at that I understood
people went through this so heavily it's
like I guess
why people get upset by like hearing
trigger words and stuff but you know the
first line of that it is you can't say
retain that's and people would message
me and say you know you can't say
anymore I go that's what I sat yeah
that's the setup to that is that you
can't even talk about how you can't talk
about it anymore yeah it was the perfect
moment of outrage yeah it was just like
it was there was a lot of outrage and
yeah I mean I knew listening to it that
there would be it's like just so obvious
then I met with with somebody who was
who was pretty outraged like they I
talked about which word about this this
whole whole whole the whole bit and
there go you know that petition also
calls for the the trailer to be taken
down everything yeah and the trailer
they Miss interpreted as being about
this when the joke and that is about
another yes so like good and then they
were telling me they're like in this
meeting and they're like I think a lot
of us got outraged we got we reacted to
the reaction in other words we didn't
look at it we didn't look it up I didn't
watch it lovely and I go and I'm sitting
there like don't you feel like you
should own that like that you didn't
watch it yeah and then you got mad yeah
and they're like kind of yeah okay but
then they made this point to me that I
kind of understood they go yeah but it
helped further our agenda so us going
after you even if it was not entirely
angley somewhere yeah they go it still
helped bring awareness to what our
ultimate goal is so even if we miss the
mr. mark a little bit the man's kind of
yeah so they're good I mean I you know I
don't here's a thing you can't feel bad
for yourself when the when the group is
this group and you go look you have it
hard enough already but but they also
were like we understand that the joke
wasn't to target you and on you it
just happened to be about words and
language yeah and it got spun into this
so like I don't I don't feel bad for
myself
I understand that what you're trying to
do but it wasn't lined up the way that
they initially thought it was and it was
mean even even in the joke you're like
well we didn't say it like that
right I gave the specific example factly
yeah we weren't like look at that guy
right which is I think exactly what you
said which it and like I pretty much I
don't think I can recall a time where
growing up or for that way anybody was
like pointing at something yeah point
someone can be like that guy yeah it was
always like to you yeah you know it's
like Ethan the man and then you
know you say to your friend about
something they did right but then of
course the reaction to that is like yeah
but you're just perpetuating you know a
hateful thing if you're saying you know
whatever that's that's how language
things change and progress over time
words take on different meanings
something becomes unacceptable and
pejorative and it goes away of course
the other conversation is then it's then
replaced with another word or term sure
so what that happens with all slurs and
all all words it's like we will outgrow
this word and then there will be a new
word you know like the one specifically
that really blows my mind yes like you
can't say anymore like I left it
Israel for five years yeah I came back
the world changed I couldn't say
anymore
yeah little people right I was like that
sounds way more condescending it sounds
to me like hey little guy yeah and by
the way I met I know little people who
find it demeaning little yes what did
you prefer some of them just don't even
want to be which makes the most no just
don't even it's laughs just a guy don't
make them but I mean it is you know I
guess voluntary on the airport I mean I
like I know most people I know black
guys girls we're cool with black but
there are those who say like call me
african-american it's like their own
voluntary I'm having a different
preference it's wild everybody but yeah
I mean I do I agree that little people I
was yeah I think I said midgets
how I'm passing and they're like it's a
little like people are super angry who's
like what are you kidding me I had to do
some research and look it up I was like
sure enough little I find that groups
have a much better sense of humor though
a little most part the little people yes
right yeah there are groups and that
have more egregious sense of humor
interesting yeah yeah Mexicans for
example I've heard from Alex oh like you
know Mexicans they never get they never
get upset they love it yeah I mean for
the most part how what you're I mean how
have you discovered that you met you if
you just doing shows every year and like
I've done shows Mex with a man with
me like just like they love it yeah man
like light me up doc you're like all
right it's LA they just want to go for
it yeah
can I ask you who is the most sensitive
can we go there I mean there's there's
uh I don't know older lesbians there's
no they're just group that's a tightness
you know it's funny because like we live
in such a quote liberal progressive City
I mean the most liberal progressive
people are not funny they don't they
take themselves too seriously they have
like that activist you know mentality
there's no humor in that show you know I
mean I'd rather do like rednecks than
that any day of the week if you're
talking about doing a show right because
they're gonna laugh at more you can
make fun of them you know do you have
these days problems it shows where
people are getting upset and walking out
or causing a scene if it's my like if
they bought it take it to my show that
doesn't really happen yeah if you just
pop in on a show I've had it happen a
few times in LA you know because we're
not other places
yeah but not I mean not a lot I mean el
you know la la is pretty good actually
for for stand-up you know the Comedy
Store is amazing The Improv but like the
store every night is just crazy with
with just comedy fans that one is he
stand-up most I'm going to that are not
going to be the type to be like ah that
cross the line because they they kind of
know where they're going they know they
see the line up they know what type of
people are on the line I'm you know I
heard bill bursts say something
interesting on his podcast he said like
now when I go on stage
saying crazier than I ever because
we were craving it because yeah yeah and
you also said it in an interview I think
I read oh they want it it's a release it
all is it's all connected though I mean
I think it's connected to you know it
goes to like who's in power what that
stands for what the blowback is against
who you know who they're pushing back
against and then that permeates the
feelings of people in public and then in
shows and it just it's this it's it's in
the air you feel it go back and forth
just like you feel a red or blue swing
in also interesting and it all kind of
ties in together there's a lot going on
and they're like the social oh yeah in
taters yes and like everything that's
going on all the little fabrics of
society are really channeling through
what you guys do absolutely yeah and you
can feel you sense it man that like if
if you're if you are like if you feel
like oh my god we're losing this
country's falling apart
you you you tend to take like a more
serious approach to everything and that
person also takes a serious approach to
commentary you know it's but then
there's a whole other group of people
who are like that's too much we're
losing our minds if we're getting yeah
and then those are the ones who want you
to say that real
so they yeah they come to the shows
wanting it to be like how come you
didn't offend us more you know I've had
people email they're like I really
thought well like you were gonna push it
harder I'm just doing stand up and be
like yeah and they're like yeah I really
was hoping you would like go harder and
I was like okay yeah no good know it man
and you know another one that blew me
away was like the same thing we went to
Israel we came back we had 4G LTE and
there were certain words I couldn't say
those a November I left when I came back
there was Ober all right now what Hoover
was so that was new to you yeah isn't
that funny man five years you were going
[Music]

didn't ask for everybody might even ask
for it but he sure made it but it's
really cool and more interestingly he

seat let's move on what'd I tell you did
we put on a good show uh but let's see
here I there there's a lot I want to get
to but let's cut to the chase cuz there
came up a clip of a news broadcast and I
love like [ __ ] Eve news broadcast
they're just always good but this is
like pure distilled cringe and the heart
of a star under gravity of gravitational
forces basically a black hole of cringe
it's so powerful and so great Dan go
ahead and roll it you know usually the
world of inflation
you guys drink it we notice is that a
good thing we got inflation
all right started over on you know
usually when you're talking about the
world of inflation you guys you probably
notice is that a good thing or or not a
good thing
inflation
I'm sorry the question again Dave is the
inflation in our world a good thing or
not a good thing it depends upon what
the title is what are we talking about
so he's an ad like this inflation con
like yeah inflate a balloon and so he's
trying so hard for this bun and I love
how he like Mouse his head like he's
waiting he's like he needs the answer
from back home in the studio is it a
good thing or a bad thing
and and I don't think that the guy in
the studio can hear or he can't see so
he's actually nobody's talking about was
it trying to make it Joe
yes is inflation a good thing or a bad
thing he's just like what are you
talking about Bob guys roll it in a
solution if you have an inflatable boat
you see if you heard the wind you right
but generally when you hear the word
inflation not economical good come to
mind yeah for me yeah yeah
well let me tell you that you're right
about if you say good you're right
because this is the world of inflatables
give yourselves a nice round of applause
everybody these are just a volunteers
coming out here today and Abby who
you're gonna have what kind of fun do

you know it's rare to come across a true
beautiful gem like that and I said hey
let's start this episode off right
because frankly we've got
thing else going from episode we've got
actually the show we're ready to wrap it
up I'm kidding I want first of all I'm
that's not a true we've got William
Osmond and I don't mean to uh you know
make it sound like he's not amazing who
did air alright today FBI
off-duty agent drops gun this I love so
effing good you know it's funny I saw
that video and I didn't know that was an
FBI guy well he's not in uh he's an
off-duty FBI agent and he's at a dance
off of all places drunk and he's he's
doing some crazy moves you know he's
really getting into it he's losing
himself in the music you know god bless
sometimes it's good to lose yourself in
the music like Ian last night Kanye Dan
got in into the Kanye preesh live what
do you call that [ __ ] how do you call it
a listening party listening party and I
got a clip of of Ian by the bonfire look
at he's in the tribal trance sometimes
you got to be in that travel yeah but
when those times happen don't have a
loaded gun on you know so this FBI guy
well let's just go ahead and watch look
at those moves
[Music]
[Applause]
got him see what here's my favorite part
why she's like my bad my bad y'all so he
actually shot somebody
yeah poor son of a [ __ ] in the foot my
bad how was it more but my bad orzo
wasn't me
no it was my bad my bad y'all FBI I
think it's under control and like took
it must have happened that he went and
grabbed the gun and pulled the trigger
on accident right which apply no why the
guns don't just go off when you drop it
not look that's a movie thing can we
play
yeah let's replay it because well it
also implies that the safety wasn't even
on I mean what though yeah freak happen
here now yeah you're loaded take it easy
I mean it he grabbed it yeah but he
barely touches it I know but like it was
already settled on the floor yeah I
think he must have pulled the trigger
he's clearly very drunk so the safety
wasn't on damn dog you're packing heat
so this this legend shots him on the
foot but was actually even better was
the guy who got shots reaction to being
shot you have that Dan
this guy's a [ __ ] ledge chorizo I had
to a screencap it all right from CNN or
whatever the [ __ ] so here we go now I
want charissa do you want this news
anchors intro I want jack-in-the-box a
dance no good just go to his viral video
we showed you earlier this week I wrote
it yeah this viral video
inflatable wacky man day this video got
a million hate I know what everyone
calls it a No
to skip to the they go to the leg with
friends at this Denver bar over the
weekend when 29 year-old rehabbed what
happened they're gonna circle it watch
his leg covered in blood
somebody called 911 and I blacked out
and I woke up to such a regular guy
finding tourniquets Reddington says his
injury is putting his physically
demanding job at risk walking is next to
impossible but he says after watching
this video dozen times but when I saw
him do a backflip I couldn't help but
laugh I don't blame the guy I don't want
to ruin his life the FBI tells ABC that
agent Bishop will be held accountable
and could also face criminal charges
Denver police say they're still waiting
I just love that guy I just couldn't
help but and he even goes as far to say
I don't want him to lose his job frankly
I do
that's FBI man grace it also I love that
screen cap of the FBI agent just smiling
at the camera with the shitty and grin
like you up there that was it like yup I
did yep my bad
damn he seems like he's you know just
enjoying life he's happy-go-lucky but
enjoying a little too much exactly FBI
supposed to have the collar on tight no
enjoyment I prefer my FBI agents with no
enjoyment see what happens when they
have fun no he needs to go down in a
statement from the bar they said they
hope the man will quit quickly return to
good condition and added that he will
receive complimentary free drinks
forever if he ever comes back that's
[ __ ] by the way if you're trying to
date that's sick you bring them to that
bar
not only to get free drinks all night
like I was shot in the leg here yeah
every drinks for life
that's pretty legit no that's the only
bar is gonna go to that's all I would go
to also not even for the free drinks
just for the street cred like this guy
was shot here they're gonna play like a
statue of him they should why did his
foot have two bullet holes and is anyone
questioning the what's going on
yeah it's that was that was a head
scratcher maybe that's like just uh
maybe that wasn't the bullet wound maybe
that was from the tourniquet they put on
or something I don't know I may be
related to an explanation of what I
think happened is he shot himself twice
said it was him that got shot so he can
get free drinks for life what I think
happened is that nobody got shot at all
never me I'm conspiracy FBI conspiracy
for lifetime free drinks yeah dude we
have the wackiest frickin stories today
dr. booty man hmm dr. booty I said boot
ate you right so this this is probably
it's funny we weren't gonna talk about
it I heard this on the radio as we were
parking in the office I know and I was
like oh my god this is incredible so
this woman her first of all I'm calling
her dr. booty but her actual last name
is bootay yeah how's that spelled damn
do you have it back there just like
booty butt with it oh here it was the
own Bo you tte okay dr. booty she's a
dermatologist that when patients were
under and without their consent she
would start dancing and recording it
like doing little bits and putting it on
YouTube she's doing [ __ ] well she's got
a scalpel doing a surgery and she's like
doing it on the beat like oh it's the
craziest [ __ ] ever car and not only that
I mean we've got footage here but like
um a hundred people apparently are suing
her for having botched surgeries Wow one
lawsuit claims that after eight hours of
surgery
someone sustained permanent brain damage
from a dermatologist dancing how the
[ __ ] does it dermatologists give someone
brain damage oh my god
and another she's leaning over the top
of patients bare buttocks without
surgical masks or gloves
she holds surgical instruments and
dances while wrapping her own lyrics to
me goes bad and Yuji my painter my
patients are bad and bougie building up
fat and the booty that's what she said
take it away you know what open right
there's a beyblade cadaver but like to
think like hey what the Sun you should
Jimmy Lee and suck up with her the
dentist has a dermatologist anybody like
she's a serial offender you know what I
mean - yeah
Oh horrible so she's done this hundreds
of times and she had the all these
videos on our YouTube channel and I
guess somebody made a complaint some
regulatory board like hey you know maybe
you shouldn't be doing surgery while
dancing and recording without permission
without using surgical gloves or being
sanitary or paying attention to your
open patient with the scalpel a crazy
man that's so scary it makes me think
like whenever you go to weird doctor and
you have all this like scary thoughts in
your head like real man they're all real
what do you think Jimmy Lee does too
when your honor and she put it on
YouTube yeah did she have subscribers
like what I don't know that it's the
channels gone now I wonder how many subs
she had yeah it's interesting its unique
content was he titled them this morning
when we heard this story they put played
a sound bite of her saying I did my
soul-searching and I have done nothing
wrong they're like do you think that um
now that you have had time to reflect do
you think you've done anything wrong I
love that line I've done soul-searching
I've searched my soul I've meditated
deep and long about this and I've
concluded I've done nothing wrong
ever in my life how what kind of sauce
you didn't you didn't search deep enough
keep searching
your soul has many crevices left still
to search but I wonder what she titled
her videos opera Nicki Minaj Wow hasn't
gone wrong right live operation Nicki
Minaj Beauty what's the name of that uh
uh bad and bougie bad and bougie live
while operating on a patient and the
thing is they blurring them in this
video but I think you could see some
bare asses and like naked cadavers what
they didn't know there be filmed a prop
the story is unbelievable lover dr.
booty and Jimmy Lee we need a crossover
of a lie
those new together yeah I'm just I'm
salivating so um let's take a quick
break when we come back we will be here

coughing beam Ian it's a really cool
invention a great story I think you guys

conspiracy about it till we've been we

today's episode is sponsored by Dollar
Shave Club quip and honey I gotta say we
have been slamming all day we're a
little bit late only four minutes but I
was thinking I was like man we used to
be like an hour late and we also didn't
even prepare like we've been here since
8:00 a.m. I like I say I'm proud of all
the guys back there
we've been slamming and jam I know we've
had all kinds of weird beginnings before
on YouTube how do we stick it how did we
do yeah we've been really trying sir
YouTube's a different game man you get
it right you get one shot so Dan how'd
we do well it felt good out here I don't
hear you and the wood everything said
shits hit in the Flint okay there yeah
we're all good I will have to go back
and check it felt pretty good though
timing felt good on y'all good we will
have to all right what's today's show
we've got a slammin hot one you guys let
me tell you what's coming up in the
intern whose birthday it is today
congratulations to him has put together
a PowerPoint presentation for us on the
Drake verse push a tee drama there's
been some real ugly back-and-forth
between the two of those freestyle
battle that's reminiscent of the good
old 90s when rappers would just were
straight-up killing each other so let's
hope that it doesn't escalate there but
the fireworks are setting off and Ian is
really he's the keeper of culture and
knowledge and he's gonna come in he's
gonna tell us really what's going on
because break down the lyrics hopefully
as well what makes him the keeper of
culture well he's a young man and he's
basically he's weirdly obsessed with
Kanye and sometimes he he concerns me
he concerns me to some degree for
example yesterday he's on the freeway he
pops a flat tire he rolls over to the
side of the 101 freeway probably one of
the most dangerous places to be in the
world there's there's there's side of
the 101 and running the bolts number two
he pulls over and he's like I know I
should call triple-a to come change my
tire but I'm I have to watch this Kanye
stream because he was streaming his new
album
so he's sitting there watching this
Kanye livestream cuz he's so into it
while cars zip past him on the
one-on-one yeah so he's he's he's in
deep that would get you qualified for
the keeper of culture yeah he's the
keeper of culture like an important
detail here's to ya the livestream for
about two hours was just a open field
with horses so that that's what kept him
on the side you know are you on the mic
yeah yeah so tell me when you were on
the side of the 101 we did anything
danger did you ever feel that you were
in danger at that point it didn't really
matter because the stream was up right
there and and and as nothing happened in
the stream did you find yourself more
more frustrated and confronted with the
you know actuality that you were gonna
have to call triple-a and possibly miss
something once that started to come into
play I did get a little worried but my
battery looked good so I was okay what I
tell you is this guy qualified or won so
he's coming in he's gonna let us know
what's going on up after that we've got
Kyle the cougar champ and Skippy the
virgin we got these two great minds on
the phone together these two guys are
the founding members of our great minds
league the league of extraordinary minds
and we got him on the phone together to
see how they interact cuz I thought hey
you know Kyle he's a cougar champ he's
seen the ropes he's been there he's done
this maybe he can give Skippy some
advice yeah well yeah fireworks flew I
have to say I did not expect what
happened because they ended up actually
getting in a bit of a fight yeah Skippy
got super angry at Kyle so that was that
was really something so we're actually
recorded that this morning because I
always have all these technical
difficulties when I have calls and I
wanted to make sure when you have two
beautiful minds like this you want to
make sure that everyone every word is
hurt right it's that important so I
cannot wait to share that with you guys
and finally we've got a new segment
called Ethan go to your room where I
face the music I've said look when
you're on a podcast you say a lot of
dumb [ __ ]
that's kind of the nature of the beast
I'm sitting here with an open mic for
two hours okay so I've said a lot of
dumb [ __ ] here and a lot of the stuff
that we should I
I'm not even throw you I should correct
the record okay so Ethan go I just don't
say anything so which is I wish I had
that option not much to correct yeah
you're smart so that's coming up and not
only that we've got voice messages and
news and so much more to get to my guys
so what that being said let's get right
to flip into it now today we were
supposed to have Tommy Weis oh and Greg
Sestero on but once again
Tommy Wiseau is probably the most
challenging guest ever to book of all
time I didn't want to say anything the
first time because I was trying to keep
a professional you know but he literally
we had him booked and that the it was
the morning of or the evening of I was
like I had a bad feeling I was like I
get the feeling Tommy's not coming and
you know in that week I prepared so much
for him I was like I was knee-deep and
all this Tommy wise oh listen you can
only watch so much Tommy wise oh and I
had watched a lot of Tommy wise oh
that's me yeah so that morning I was
like Danny I got a feeling man I don't
know can you just reach out to them and
make sure they're coming so Dan reaches
out them in the morning up and they're
like oh yes sorry Tommy is really busy
he's not gonna make it so I was gonna be
polite and be like a scheduling issues
but this time it happened again I'm not
exactly this time right it kind of
happened again and this time was a
little stranger but they're I don't know
you couldn't make it in well the only
time they could make it was right when I
was coming off the plane basically but
we call it and we emailed and everything
he's got this receptionist at a
yahoo.com email that apparently says
receptionist but I have a feeling it's
just him was that your impression damn
that we were just talking about yeah
yeah we were skeptical right from the
get-go
it the the at Yahoo just seemed suspect
from the beginning I don't
so where we'll get him in here
eventually but so anyway he's really uh
he's we all considering doing it but it
was so tight with my flight that I don't
think it would have worked
no it wouldn't work yeah anyway god
bless tom thank you thank you I wish you
were here to it so we could expand on it
but hopefully soon looking guy dougie
yeah we can get them in here and get the
true real story of Tom and wise Oh
Eva how was your trip you just got back
on Tuesday mm-hmm it's weird every time
I go back I guess I get more used to the
states the longer I'm here you know
every time I go back it gets weirder and
weirder for me right Mike oh you realize
how loud everyone is oh yeah I think
everyone is yelling all the time I don't
want their Israeli stereotypes or real
like the stereotype is that they're
these bald shouting Hermes rocky you
know everyone's doing this you go there
yeah it's real it's real man I remember
the last time we were there this is such
an Israeli experience we took a taxi
I'm Tel Aviv de les parents house why
don't you tell me where you were
speaking Hebrew with him I was I was
like I need to go to this address my
parents house and it's like it's near a
famous Junction so I was like near this
Junction but I'll tell you how to get
there when we get there because no one
knows the exact address right
they don't really put ways not all do
not all the drivers it's like old school
her old school you also can't pay with
card um which is like I got used to it
here they beat their kids in Israel
their old school they don't do that
subdue sound but so anyway we get to
that Junction and then he's like he's
about to continue straight when you need
to make a left and I'm like you gotta go
left here and he he just refused he's
like no I'm going straight here this is
not what you told me
just make a left it's like we're two
minutes away and you wouldn't do it and
then we just I don't I don't even
remember any system we we had that it
was on the meter which what I didn't
understand right you're paying him we
weren't not trying to scam him he picked
this out basically on the side of the
freeway
it was a super it's busy junction we
basically got kicked out because it's
got refused to drive another five
minutes dealers house and then and then
it was like putting on the you know the
receipt like here's what I'm what I'm
gonna charge you you know when they like
close it and prints the receipt and I
was like I'm not paying you you're not
thinking me what I need to go yeah yeah
that was being Israeli you guys seen it
she's shouting in Hebrew he's shouting
in Hebrew is all this going on can you
shout at Hebrew say stood me favorite
say I'm not I'm not [ __ ] paying you
say that in Hebrew I don't I don't curse
in here I'm not paying you say that in
Hebrew and you'll always showdown at
likhaan that's good but too happy yeah
we got off at the junction and then I
had to call my dad and he came and pick
this out yeah but that's that's just one
little thing that would happen to you
that's typical yeah that's Israel but
one thing that did happen that is worth
talking about is that elos brand-new
wack book air I don't think you're gonna
correct me now that you drop $3,400 on
stopped working it it wouldn't charge
yeah I don't know why I plugged it in
left for the whole day I was like I'm
gonna come back here to be fully charged

total area you know I'm sorry when you
sped a converter yeah I I don't know
what happened it was supposed to work
yeah I know and you spent $3,400 it's
gotta work it's only been like a month
yeah I gotta say that my razor laptop
that costs $1,000 less has been kicking
butt yeah cuz once I you can take it to
Israel so what there's just something in
the air there get yelled at by too many
Israelis

really slammin I got to say 2000-3000

Ryan Seacrest Ryan Seacrest he seems
like such a wholesome guy right yeah
he's not well right I don't know if we
can well well here's here's the clip and
this is just so good I actually thought
he was gay I almost didn't even have a
doubt about it
but on what is the show American Idol or
what was it well sooner they show top
one of these talent shows whatever
they're all the same I don't know how
they [ __ ] up this bed he doesn't know
that they came back and he's flirting
with Katy Perry like in a really creepy
way and it just blows my mind that a
show this big could blunder like they
didn't know they were bad well just go
ahead and play it then I think we're
back I've seen I've seen people saying
you know they thought maybe it was a bit
but there's a moment when he looked
crazy I doesn't he's right and you're
like that's real he says to her he says
your mom's hot yeah and then he and then
he says you're not a mom yet do you want
to talk about it it's weird but it's so
beautiful that this was captured why
Ryan Seacrest create like bro this is
not the time or place even like if is
this a me to a moment is this a subtle
me to a moment to have the balls to
creep on her that blatantly here right
where there are locations about him to
me to stuff I think there was something
about a hairdresser I don't remember
what the allegations were but yeah you
want to talk about it I love that are
you mom let's talk about it hey hey I am

there you go
rod the mom's pretty is this the
conversations that take place off I
[Laughter]
think we're back yes that is so weird
like you know this is like I'm the
biggest production in the world makes me
feel a bit a bit better about what we're
doing here you want to talk about it
it's so awkward so so saddling me to a
moment well I have to say a very subtle
one I have to I kind of agree because I
have to say to have the balls to talk
like that - not only anyone but Katy
Perry like the biggest most famous
powerful woman in Hollywood but also of
other dudes it's hey you want to talk
about it
damn what happened his face his face
looks kind of looks like there were you
were right his there's a what do we got
stylists that has accused television
host of multiple instance of sexual
harassment abuse over seven years as she
worked for him well if you worked for
him for seven years it's almost kind of
hard to be like take those very
seriously I had I was so miserable for
seven years my off the mark you quit
right after seven [ __ ] years of being
sexually her
maybe a year maybe two years seven
that's high school and college it's hard
to do better as a stylist than ryan
seacrest though right i mean that's
that's a hard gig to walk away from it's
probably good money well I don't know
what she accused him off what do we got
here just making comments like that you
want to talk about it yeah hey look what
you do with my hair see you're not a mom
yet you want to talk about it what can I
do
can I help you become a mom see it says
right secrets groped her vagina rubbed
his erect penis against her while clad
only in his underwear and slapped her
buttocks so hard that it left a large
welt still visible hours later I'd say
after seeing that I believe it oh my god
I believe it after I saw that that was
like a really creepy weird thing you
want to talk about it your mom's hot
your mom's hot can I rub my boner on you
you want to talk about making a baby
kind of interesting but but if I'm Ryan
Seacrest
I wouldn't even like you know that it's
a hard cut back to live television
I wouldn't even [ __ ] blink if you're
gonna be creepy weirdo who would like
you know after the show yeah I wonder if
she's so like protected that he almost
doesn't even have access to her he's
like [ __ ] this is my only tonight to
make a pass on Katy Perry in between uh

lot of I mean I know you're Ryan
Seacrest and you're you're kind of a big
deal but come on dawg you're not you're

Pusha T thing but let's let's get your
ass in here we got a lot to talk about
I'm worried about you and you're you're
it you're in too deep you're pulling
over on the side of the road to watch
Khan you're getting banned from Kanye
why were you banned from a Kanye forum
to not go too much into it I posted a
leak to an unreleased song mm-hmm and
that is not in the rules did you know it
wasn't in the rules when you posted it

was in the know there is their street
cred and in these forms that you're
trying to impress other people they're
in the digital streets right and it and
was there talk about you being banned

thought I was but they forgot me pretty
clearly nobody cared about your ass

tried to make an account under a
different IP and somehow they knew and
they banned me again well they're
serious about it now when you when you
knowingly broke the rules did you expect
that
just had enough street cred that you
could go into the radar yeah I was like

user name on their forum I can't say
that oh really
I can't reveal it really I'll meet him
no no I can't I can't why not that it's
bad but it all still exists there and
all the Pug you wanna dig in like I
welcome everybody to another h3 podcast
live live today ela is out of town and
BMI care is being swamped Erik just
finished wiping my ass we had a
cigarette together outside I get
diarrhea every time I some oaklands true
and I said Eric I appreciate you being
here on the show but uh that's not where
your duties end so thank you for
cleaning me up
appreciate that glad to have you here
last week we're streaming on YouTube
again we're just testing it out it's fun
I find it to be I'm really curious which
one's better Twitter YouTube because the
the streaming numbers are really high
and it's just nice to have a holistic
experience yeah but the problem with
YouTube as I spoke about last time is
that wherever it falls there shall it be
buried there's no take-backs right when
you stream on youtube you can have a
Bill O'Reilly moment everyone's gonna
see it everybody's gonna see my Bill
O'Reilly mom yeah and they did in the
last episode that's right we had
probably the most horrific start oh my
god well yeah it was by talking it up a
little bit thing is I showed you a clip
I didn't show you the whole thing
because it was getting to cringey okay
it's like a whole minute yeah I had this
the stream open and the sound on on my
laptop so was playing the sound back for
the whole first minute plus of the
podcast before we stopped me and Dan
were just like we were mortified it was
our worst nightmares last week
so I just I need to own this the moment
heats up to uh by the way do we stick
the landing this time Dan yeah timing
was perfect nice although we just
[ __ ] jinx ourselves what we already
made no boy yeah we already made it you
through whatever happens now is fine
because like the worst time to have a
[ __ ] is like when somebody opens a
video yeah like I'm gonna watch this
video and it's just like a total meta
somehow a million people watch that last
posit always like this yeah exactly I
thought these guys ran a tight ship
yeah what is this right no no Sid you
know but Dan can you pull up that clip
from from last week yeah just cracks me
up that a million people watched
actually first of all a huge thank you
to everybody that's done where's
everybody to another episode
of the h3 podcast lah that's right we
are back and we are streaming shocking
it a mixing it was that probably more
help the first 10 seconds of that good
okay good good good and then there's no
idea what they were in for mix it up a
little bit keep you on your coat this
episode is sponsored by him so the thing
is at this point if it's stopped it's
like okay we can get over it I couldn't
hear Dan through the speaker look so
Dan's like shits open your shits open
and I can hear them will be great as if
it was happening now and because this
this can't be yeah this can't be good to
watch but like it keeps going anyway I
just want to give a shout out to
everybody who's stuck it through
troopers you know stuck it through and
this time we hopefully have got it
well it's okay to have some grab beans
yeah growing pains most definitely other
comments about the YouTube stream
everybody seems to enjoy a streaming on
YouTube but the comments were that the
chat the live chat was truly god-awful
which surprised me because I didn't
think you could top twitch chat of
toxicity but apparently YouTube manages
to talk again yeah you tube tops twit
you know YouTube always help does twitch
right say that and always I think people
are more conditioned to leave ridiculous
comments on YouTube it's yeah it comes
with the territory well part of the
problem is that on Twitch we have sub
only mode
yeah so really you know hones down on
the on the spam but I would just want to
invite everybody who is here to spam and
just you know ruin the chat I want to
say that we changed the frequency to
five minutes so at this point I welcome
all the spammers to come enjoy yourself
in between five minutes I mean if you're
waiting five minutes to spam you're
pretty much just a viewer at that point
so if you want to make multiple accounts
just get those views up enjoy yourself
you know put your feet up have a meal
enjoy the podcast and then you can leave
a spam comment every 5 minutes
it's very diplomatic fix you know you
didn't kick them out
today you're welcome you're pretty much
just a viewer at this point so welcome
to the stream everybody next up you guys
may have seen our new video I'm
exhausted
last night I was up till last night the
night before so like 1:00 a.m. because I
found out that YouTube is [ __ ] with
the sub fee I saw that video yeah it's
like the final four people didn't see
the video basically YouTube said that
they're testing the sub feed to put it
in a personalized order and what that
means is basically they have an
algorithm that's going to decide like
hey which content is gonna get us the
most watched I'm pretty rich you know
Elsa what else video yeah lots of Elsa
now mostly it most likely BuzzFeed
people people trying to figure out what
this is America means alright lots of
the columns in columns right so we made
a video talking about that because the
the sub feed is like the last sacred
place right on YouTube untouched you
have the home page the sidebar that's
where most traffic comes from on YouTube
and you don't really know how that [ __ ]
works like you go to the home page why
is something there I don't know yeah I
post a video I don't see it on the home
page why is there like one guy at
YouTube who can can [ __ ] with those and
just be like hmm I'm gonna show my
buddy's video real quick probably not
that's probably a huge yeah you know be
that'd be erroneous yeah have that
functionality and one did yeah I think
it's just the algorithm but they're very
controlling of they're very intentional
it's all just about watch time right but
it's very cold it's very unfeeling like
do we really want a platform that just
doesn't care about users choice at all
and just like you know the god of watch
time there was a big backlash when when
Instagram did it right exactly beside it
exactly because you want to feel like
you have some choice of the content
you're watching and so anyway YouTube
responded to the video we made they said
there's a very small experiment we're
testing a new completely optional way to
sort the sub feeds with a small group of
people all videos are still there and
again people have control over the
settings aka they don't have to use it
but
here's what I'll say to that which is I
think total BS the default setting is
personalized you have to go out of your
way to change it back to chronological I
mean they really just do that so that
they say that it's optional but how many
people are actually gonna go yeah I'd
switch it if it's if it's optional then
if everybody's saying they want it the
other way how long until you just force
them to have it the new way exactly
and that that's basically what I'm
saying here is that like it starts there
it's a slippery slope once you've
decided that you're willing to [ __ ] what
the sub feed yeah it's only a matter of
time like this guy been trusted flagger
he's he's like I don't know this guy has
a lot of insight information he always
has a lot of interesting insights on
YouTube he works he's trusted he's
trusted he does actually work with them
to some large capacity he said they've
been working on this for a very long
time behind the scenes and I'm squid
scared if it will be implemented
permanently even though you can opt out
I was told if rolled out everyone would
be opted in by default negative impact
on everyone don't do this YouTube and
it's like you said on it on on Facebook
they had it used to be chronological and
the moment that they optimized the feed
on Facebook and they doing the same
thing on Instagram is when those social
medias became such [ __ ] garbage right
because you're on the platform and you
feel you feel the pole like they're just
trying to keep you there as long as
possible I every time I go to Facebook
for some [ __ ] reason Facebook is like
hey you
you love Martin Lawrence's posts right
Martin Lawrence the actor he has this
[ __ ] if everybody should go check out
Martin Lawrence's Facebook cuz it's
insane Jelena it's like he's like so
flowy Antonio in the way that he's just
like hosting these yeah and like what
it's like to have a Cuban girlfriend
Martin is like wow this is crazy
like what what is Martin doing all day
Martin Martin found a new vertical so
basically Martin Lawrence is gonna be at
the top of all of our feeds but yeah on
Facebook they changed it to optimized
several years ago and they made it
optional until one day they're like hey
you know what this results in more watch
time or more ad revenue so we're just
gonna remove the option right they act
like that's not what's gonna
that's definitely what is going out it
is kind of silly the way all these
companies talk to us about changes that
we don't like and they're like no don't
worry guys you can have an option don't
you could you don't understand behind
the scenes they're just like what the
[ __ ] what do you think we're gonna
change anything for them
yeah now this is money I mean I wonder
if in a way they're that naive that
they're like it's optional how does it
how does it benefit them like what I'm
more ad revenue really they keep you on
the page longer they don't that yeah
objective of all these social medias is
to keep you on the page as long as oh
yeah that makes sense they just suck
your ass in keep you watching very more
ads if it's chronological like when I go
to Reddit and I see all of the links on
the front page or purple I'm like oh
well I did that and then I leave right I
mean I don't leave I go to the next page
right but if it wasn't chronological
later that it would be like he's already
clicked all the purple links let's give
them a new batch right theoretically it
that doesn't sound bad but what ends up
happening is that Jesus Christ that girl
Kroy got me yeah me too me what ends up
happening these things is that the sub
feat is just gonna end up like the home
page right like based on other users
activity we've determined that this
video results in more watch time and
more time on page so we're gonna put
that at the top of your sub feed and not
this small creator that you're a fan of
or anybody could be it could be me it
could be you it could be PewDiePie this
video didn't get as much watch time so
we're gonna put it at the bottom yeah
that's how they rate it weird man I mean
I'd love to get into their heads and
figure out what the hell they're their
ultimate plan is because this feels like
part of something else yeah well the
scary part that I talked about is just
like once they tinker with the sub feed
they now have the ability to completely
make your channel disappear yeah because
as a creator it's so frustrating when
you go to the home page and you don't
see your new video yeah like why isn't
it there I don't know I guess there's a
reason whatever and you don't see it on
the sidebar of other people's videos
sometimes you know what I mean it's
people also saying like I got
unsubscribed from you right like there's
some strange errors going on to keep
people from watching things but I don't
know we should get jobs at YouTube yeah
like we should we should go
in disguise like interview for jobs and
get the get the inside dirt just a
comedy mustache yeah trusted Ben you
gonna help us out yeah trust trustworthy
Ben I do joke I'm very qualified to work
at YouTube once our channel dies [ __ ]
top they're gonna make me say uh earth
to the god of watch time house shredder
will probably get the job for sure so I
don't know they responded but I just I
just think they're so nice there'd like
they don't understand why we're so upset
because it's optional yeah that's gotta
be a tough [ __ ] job in the PR guide
or PR person at YouTube it's like yeah a
half of the population of the country is
mad at you
hmm oh [ __ ] what do i do there PR
department sucks dude don't say anything
what did what is the PR persons job at
yeah there's definitely tread lightly on
if I was that guy I'd be like okay how
do I say no threads too lightly yeah he
doesn't say [ __ ] right he's like all
right we had a meeting and we've decided
we're not gonna say anything
yeah do you think we have meetings like
when when they have to respond to you
yeah I think I'm sure that like there's
a couple is like a huddle
I know like I'm certain guys Ethan's
blasting us yeah what do we say yeah I'm
sure that they do I'm not kidding they
do actually they just tell you to go
[ __ ] yourself they PR persons like all
right guys we've thought a lot about
this and we've decided to say nothing
yeah this will not get us in trouble
yeah there's no way they're gonna know
about that it's probably true that's
probably the best course of action yeah
say nothing just say say nothing yeah
we'll get him later all right well let's
move on to uh more upbeat news the Texas
shooting yeah actually want to I don't
wanna talk about the shooting and all
the details hmm
I'm fascinated you guys know about this
Texas shooting another school shooting
[ __ ] look at this superstar Jesus
Christ
and that guy's Oh [ __ ] eyes a young
[ __ ] these kids are so goddamn young
it's so crazy you think that guy owns
the samurai sword he needs more answers
not enough length in the back for that
to be a card-carrying samurai sword boy
means that needs more of a mullet that
prison jumpsuit is very Naruto I think
he looks good in it yeah he does
look at his that's a headband and he'll
be full roleplay okay there was another
shooting this morning by the way yeah
another [ __ ] shooting this time a 12
he was - it was a seventh-grader he was
12 years old do you know a twitter well
this is the guy that stopped him look at
this monster but whoa I'm gonna [ __ ] I'm
gonna talk more about what this hero did
but first I feel like everybody's
talking about how do we how do we stop
this it's clearly gone on it's happening
every [ __ ] week it trips me out when
we were kids I didn't think about
somebody rolling up at my school with a
gun yeah and I feel like they the
experience of kids in public school
these days it is that they're not just
expecting it they're waiting for it to
happen right I never had any kind of
drill never a drill that no metal
detectors yeah
there's like people shooting off blanks
in in school hallways just to get kids
ready are you are you serious like I saw
a video of one doing that so I think it
might be a little know like they bring
in a trained officer or something like
that is so twisted yeah so I'm wondering
like there's this raging debate is it
guns as a mental health and I'm just I'm
always thinking like what like well
first of all feels like we're not doing
anything like a lot of people are like
let's ban guns and then everyone else is
like let's not ban guns and ultimately
everyone everyone screams at each other
but still now after this happening for
so long nothing's happening and I'm
starting to think that I mean the
availability of guns is is definitely a
problem although one that I'm not sure
how to tackle but I actually think that
there's more potent issues than than
guns one being is just basically how the
media fetishizes all these school
shooters like every time it happens you
know they treat these kids like they
have put them on like the top scoreboard
it's like you got ten why do you do it
wow that's always the question why do
you do it who is
let's get pictures of it ma'am what it
is Facebook page say tell me everything
and then it's true like for a whole week
for a whole new cycle it's like every
detail into this person
life yeah and it's like oh he got ten
that's pretty good but you know
Columbine had like 50 that's the high
score currently that was a really great
dry you made a valiant you know effort
to top the scoreboard for us ten pretty
good mediocre school shooting well how
do you how do you combat that I think
the media needs to just shut the [ __ ] up
yeah don't show pictures don't show
names don't talk about him like I'm
doing now but I'm making fun the guy
looks like you know I mean I apologize
for actually putting that up I meant to
scroll down to the that wasn't my fault
dad's on the scroll but it's not I do I
do want to see his face cuz he's a goofy
looking [ __ ] yeah but like well we're
making fun of him but I'm talking about
like the established media right there
they romanticize him well because people
click it they want to see it the news
has always just been like they're just
feeding oh you want the meat we have the
meat we're the meat makers it's kind of
related in a way to what I'm talking
about with YouTube like Almighty watch
time but what they're after is the
almighty click right and they don't they
don't care they don't analyze at what
cost we pay they pay we as a society pay
to get all those clicks it's it's also
the amount of reporters who show up like
the day of like robbed bet you right now
there's a shitload of like news vans
parked outside the school where this
just happened trying to interview like
parents and kids circus it's [ __ ]
insane know what I I've talked about it
before but it's worth mentioning again
the really awful one in Vegas that
happened yeah there was so many
commercials during the live report like
they just don't [ __ ] even acknowledge
or care yeah they're rolling dr. pepper
ads I took pictures of all my phones I
was so shocked during a live report
there on the call with the doctor yeah
that way reports are in that he was
enjoying a nice refreshing dr. pepper
right before he went in there guns
blazing this catastrophe reporting
brought to you by doctor doctor this
school shooting brought to you by
coca-cola mmm that's peppery have a
fresh one get excited with a coca-cola
and shoot up your school by the way did
you get you oh you got shot hey what
happened what don't take him in the
ambulance yet
I want to interview this guy yeah
exactly that's not far the leg wound
he's fine
this excuse me young man you appear to
be bleeding here have a sip of this nice
coca-cola get you through it I should
not disturb yes we can the official
beverage of school shooting
it is pretty ridiculous there is there's
a one in Texas there's like videos of
like you know these kids are given the
quotes and [ __ ] but it's there it's the
reporter and then if you look there's a
[ __ ] shitload of reporters all like
oh look at that
yeah just vultures man absolutely they
don't think about it they don't
understand the consequence you know
making money that way do you think
people like within the world of
journalists are like hey man love the
way you reported that to school shooting
school shooting so how did you get those
kids out of the ambulance so you could
interview them that kid was basically he
[Music]
welcome everybody to another episode of
the h3 podcast live
that's right we are back and we are
streaming
on youtube welcome everybody
we thought it'd be fun
to come over to youtube and give it a
shot and see what it feels like because
we've never actually live streamed the
show on youtube we know the content
lives here so i thought it would be a
fun experience to see how the experience
differs just mix it up a little bit keep
you on your toes
today's episode is sponsored by hymns
blue apron and express vpn
so ela you are looking it's an extremely
good today's stream
on your computer
today's episode by the way is it working
are we live we're live but i think
you're watching the stream on your
laptop
i just entered a hellscape that i never
want to go back to
what happened
that was the sound of hell was it okay
if you go to hell that's why you're
pretty much
that is eternal damage
it's really different between the two
because on twitch you have 30 minutes to
just [ __ ] around while you stream
because we take it off we cut it and put
it on youtube here you live stream and
the vod just wherever it lives there
shall be buried
there's no take backs here so it's a
little more stressful i'm a little more
on edge
you know
there's no take backs there's no
starting over like if i slip a couple
racial slurs on twitch it can be like
hey let's maybe cut the slurs ethan
not that that happens it's happened so
many times people don't know because we
cut it
i'm actually a huge i'm hugely racist
but
we have good editors
oh there's so much to get to today i'm
actually really i'm super excited about
today's show we have a ton of new stuff
we're trying including our first ever
live performance musical
we have completely pimped out the back
room we have chaos chaos which is a
really wonderful i would say indie rock
i feel like that's a good uh yeah
description they're incredible i can't
wait for you guys to hear them they're
going to be playing at the bottom of the
show we are going to talk about my
social media detox talking about logan
paul getting a
vasectomy
from chris dalia on twitter he straight
up snipped his tubes and i know you guys
don't like me talking about logan paul
because i do talk about him a lot
but give me a [ __ ] break
it's the he's humiliated himself so hard
how am i not supposed to he gave him a
prostate exam and he snipped his tubes
all in one move i dare you to find an
ass doctor that can do that [ __ ]
finger in and i'm telling you
crystal is an incredible surgeon
um what else
that's about it let's get right there
flip into it so you guys probably know
that i was
we we were taking a week break we
where we weren't using social media for
a full week seven days pretty much
well it was a big a stay vacation and i
had just got this feeling that i was
wasting
so much [ __ ] time
on all these social medias
it was the first thing i would do you
know in the morning
when you catch yourself
so bad
when you catch yourself going for that
phone like your eyes open and like even
before your first thought or impulse to
pee enters your head the phone is the
first impulse that's sick yeah the first
thing i'll do instagram
right and i'm not even active i barely
post on instagram yeah but i'll scroll
down every morning for like an hour
everybody listening probably knows about
this impulse that we all have for me
it's facebook i never use it but i've
been using that website for so freaking
long it was my first social media that
i'll when i open a browser i will
inflexively without thinking start
typing facebook
and it's so [ __ ] up and these days
i'll still do it just from like muscle
memory but i'll close it immediately
because i don't want that [ __ ] it's
insane um
so i st and not only the time wasting
but also i feel like
it was making me unhappy because you're
always thinking about all these other
people you're worrying about all these
other people what they're doing yeah
you're not everyone else is having so
much fun right and they look so good
making amazing
good [ __ ] yeah
it's like everything else looks so good
and then you sort of feel this sadness
yeah
and and you're not living in the
physical world
your head is in you're just consumed by
all this [ __ ] but you don't even
think about what's in front of you
people are in front of you every you
know the physical world and i have this
feeling too that spending so much time
on social media actually impairs my
thoughts i feel like i don't think as
clearly or as freely
because it literally just
is a is a distraction
when you're on social media you're not
thinking about [ __ ]
so it's almost like you know in brave
new world they give you these caps so
you can't think
yeah that's kind of what twitter is in a
weird way
you know what i mean twitter instagram
they're all
i don't know because i used to love
instagram but now instagram is just as
depressing as all the other
facebook bought it right they ruined
everything so let me tell you about how
my week was um
so
all throughout the week first of all i
was
i had to erase
youtube and twitter and instagram
off my phone first of all because
you just catch yourself
aimlessly clicking open the tab
and you look at it for a second before
you realize like oh [ __ ] i'm not
supposed to be doing this but that's too
much yeah so it was really a beautiful
thing when i erased it off my phone i
would go to look for it
out of memory and then i'd be like
that's right it's not there
so i feel like that step was super
important first of all
um
but the thing first of all that i
realized was like
how much free time you have
like i'll wake up in the morning
and i'll
i'll wake up at 8 00 am and i'll without
thinking about it literally waste two
[ __ ] hours
on my phone
on reddit reddit is a bad one i didn't
visit reddit at all either read it or
twitter all these guys
yeah
yeah you so i'll wake up at 8 a.m and i
grab my phone and i'm like
i'll go to like a news site and see the
headlines and i'm like well i can't [ __ ]
around on a news page for two hours
so then i'm just stuck with
myself so i ended up doing all this [ __ ]
like i fixed
some exercise machine
think about [ __ ] put on put on tv watch
a show which is something it's so crazy
i like i'm like i don't have time to
watch my favorite show i'm so [ __ ]
busy
meanwhile you're lit you are wasting two
hours every morning so i put on a show
you know
or i'll put on a video game by the way i
beat god of war it was fantastic when's
the last time i beat a video game yeah
fantastic
ela hated that
i'm like i never played a game all of a
sudden it's like i'm alone in the house
there's no one to talk to ethan cannot
get up he cannot help he can't walk
shredder is paralyzed it's like being
alone
let me play my game woman
i hate it but okay all right well that's
that's a conversation for another time i
loved that game so much i recommend
everyone play god of war
it was a ton of fun the storytelling was
breathtaking and if you have a
significant other they'll love it
they will they'll love that they'll love
it i guess the fact that almost means
that you love me that we have a good
relationship right
yeah because if you hated me you'd be
like play your game shut the [ __ ] up
right
no i hate being like alone and then i'm
like so
lonely
sad dude
um
what the [ __ ] was i saying
so
oh
uh god i lost my train of thought from
the god of war what were you talking
about the uh uh
a television show and i would really
enjoy watching a documentary or a movie
or a show that i like and you know
classically when we were kids tv
was thought to be the biggest time
waster of all time
and i'm thinking they're thinking like
this is not a bad activity because to
consume tele well
to consume media in that way you have to
be at home you have to be in a physical
location you have to have the time set
aside to sit there if it's two or three
hours or whatever
you have to be there and you have to
have that time allotted for it yeah
and you're taking in a creative work of
something or somebody there's some value
there right somebody poured a lot of
soul and energy into creating that yeah
now if you compare that to social media
okay
social media has taken time wasting
procrastination to
levels never before seen
because you have in your pocket the
ability to waste time anywhere
any [ __ ] where you are you can blow
an hour no problem and here's the part
that really gets you and there's nothing
of value there
nothing
a television show is a beautiful
work of art
the blood sweat tears and create a
vision of hundreds of people
social media is nothing
are you telling me that logan paul is
not putting out creative art when he's
on twitter tweeting
well there's some debate there's some
debates we had there i'm being
hyperbolic of course you must carve out
a space for logan paul with everything
you talk about um but
like there's nothing of value lost if
you're off twitter for a week
you lose nothing
it's just you know what i mean
that's that's 10 hours of your life
in the physical
plane of existence
so the first two days were hard i was
kind of anxious and the thing is you
feel out of the loop you know
the the really hard one for me was not
going on reddit but that one was really
important to to not do
and you feel like you're missing out on
stuff like apparently
kanye and justin roiland were tweeting
at each other and we were gone yeah we
got updates
we got updates in a group chat about
that one
but like
the yeah the worst was ready because i
get my news from there but i just went
on like a news website
and got it there and you that takes like
five to ten minutes right you you really
you feel like you're missing so much but
you're not if there's a big headline you
hear about it on the radio you hear
about it everybody from france yeah like
people used to no man is an island
you're not you're not disconnected if
you're not on reddit there's people that
don't use reddit believe it or not
i actually don't really
you know from right what i'll check the
subreddit sometimes
but
are you [ __ ] crazy i love reddit so
much it's a problem but again it turns
into all the other social medias i go to
reddit
and i start scrolling and what happens
is you're getting a dopamine kick like
when you do a drug a reward system that
like that on all social media and it's
harder and harder to get that
satisfaction of like oh i love this post
that's just what i was looking for and
i'll go to reddit and i'll scroll for
pages and pages until i find something
i'm like that was you know what i mean
i skimmed that [ __ ] so hard now
anyway i'm now that i'm back
i kind of begrudgingly reinstalled all
the apps on my phone i didn't want to
because i felt just like mm-hmm it's so
blissful
but it's kind of weird for us because
it's also kind of work yeah to
to tweet and post and stuff like that
like i have to refresh and
yeah just to be present on yeah it is
important
i think what i'm going to try doing
as much as possible is just
doing the post
and then getting out
i mean no you know everyone's
i just got to get out man no offense to
anyone who's making bomb-ass tweets out
there
i just need to get out
i don't think it's healthy what we're
doing to ourselves
and then this brought me to another
question that i had for myself i'm
thinking we used to goof on this guy
prince yep
who made this video like uh look up from
your phone is super dramatic and corny
and i used to be like you know this guy
he's talking [ __ ] on phones like
shut up just don't use your phone and i
used to blast this guy and say he's such
a nerd
and i was like wait
am i like what's the difference between
me now because i'm i'm saying that i
don't think social media is good for me
it really took us like right it took us
like a couple of days we were like wait
were we making fun of him and now we're
like the victims i need to reassess that
because i still feel like the
correlation is not exact yeah i don't
know if i'm in denial
you know what i mean well let's watch
the video because let me refresh some of
you guys memory this is what we're
talking about here let me pull this up
where the f flipping heck here it is
down at itself
did you know the average person spends
four years of his life looking down at
his cell phone
[Music]
it's like where'd you get that i don't
know i wrote about it like all right man
all right i'm just gonna let it play i'm
gonna let you guys watch this it's hard
for me not like i agree with him kind of
i think now but let's watch the video
but it's the way it does they like them
music did you know that the average
person spends four years
this video came out like four years ago
i mean people were only using social
media heavily for like four years
it wasn't as bad as it is today when he
made the video so was he profit yeah was
he ahead of his time right
no this guy's just kind of clone i will
these touch screens can make us
like this is the sh see what he's doing
is like
well
what he's doing is like
when so i don't believe that
i think what i'm talking about is like
somebody on a toilet taking a [ __ ] but
on twitter when we go to dinner or
anyone today goes to dinner do you not
open your phone
but is that a problem between
relationships like she's there like
seriously dude i just want to live my
life i guess i guess that's that's a
problem that he taught like the problems
with the relationship the problem is
everybody everybody's doing it you don't
have a problem no everybody's doing it
right it's the problem you and yourself
he was speaking the problem with his
video i'm not i just got to flood a
plate for you guys yeah but let me just
say this
i think the problem with his video is
that he's speaking to this like
these enlightened few
who are like i see the problem
i have a flip phone
i only use nokias from 1993. i'm
enlightened like unlike all my plebeian
scumbag friends who use iphones [ __ ]
peasant [ __ ]
i'm on a higher plane of existence it's
funny because we used to kind of be like
that for a while like we didn't have a
smartphone when everyone else did
remember for for the longest time our
plane of existence why do you think our
videos were better
[Laughter]
but eventually you got to get that
smartphone
i think it's coming from that place of
like authority of like
we know
we are enlightened
and we see the problem with the world
they don't they are the problem it's
like it's like the vegans who
give vegans bad rap because they're like
preachy about it yeah
you need to look up like we were at we
were actually at a restaurant this week
which rather outside sitting
and a lady came to me and she was like
you're eating here and i'm like yeah
i remember that
and she was like you know you shouldn't
like there's no difference between what
you're eating and and like she pointed
at trader yeah and it's like you know
maybe you're making a good point but
like why i don't know
leave me alone the reluctance of being
like that's fine point but at the same
time do you do this to everybody you see
with the dog who's eating it and i'm
gonna approach a conversation with you
and like i'm trying to have a lunch
right now which i'm trying to live my
life can you [ __ ] move on please
i but the thing that you understand is
that she's on a higher plane of
enlightenment okay like you can't
possibly understand the vast intellect
that her and this guy they're looking
down from like mount olympus and you can
possibly understand
did you know that
that people waste four years of their
life on their phones either
by the time someone's seven years old
they've wasted six years of their life
on their phone
i think he said do the math
not four hours he said four years
welcome everybody to another episode of
the h3 podcast today's episode is
sponsored by squarespace honey and quip
we have got an incredible flippant
episode to unback for you today
okay from first of all we have later
coming in the boys jack and eric
first of all already the best episode
doesn't get better than that until now
we've got on the phone today
kyle the cougar champion you guys may
recall him from a recent video we did he
was featured in a tlc the learning
channel
a documentary about strange addictions
he's a 30 year old dude who slam dunks
on 90 year olds but he dates exclusively
older women
and he basically wrote to us after we
made the video talking about him saying
like
they they misportrayed him he wanted to
clarify a couple of things
i have a couple of things i want to
clarify with him too
but he's an interesting guy right i mean
who who who of us have lived that life
you know what i mean
nobody to actually slay someone with
your penis is kind of like
the ultimate honor as a man it's like i
[ __ ] i killed her with my dick
i wonder what he has to say about that
i'll ask if that's an accurate portrayal
of what he does in the bedroom
um so he's lined up we're gonna get on
the phone with kyle and then jack and
eric are gonna hop right in and
it's the may the force be with you memes
happy star wars day
in a way the new star wars are fun but
they've also kind of ruined
the specialness of star wars
it used to be may the may the fourth be
with you and it's like this beautiful
perfect franchise that everybody loves
and now it's all like that one was okay
this one was fine it's like there's
nothing special there's han solo origin
movie coming out in like a week it's
like
you know it'll probably get a 70. and
then all of a sudden
because we all wrote off the prequels
we're all like well it's still perfect
because george came back and he's a
little old
i don't know
i see what you mean yeah
i have fun watching them just live it
you know just live things you know ian
the intern is um an adamant defender of
the prequels he loves them whoa
interesting yeah yeah i like this
argument with him a few times ian i'd
like to bring you on and possibly could
you prepare a dissertation and we can
kind of like challenge your thesis like
a doctorate's degree
he's out walking shredder but when he
gets back i'll uh i'll see if he's
he probably had something prepared he
was pretty passionate about it he has
interesting theories in
he's a free thinker and under a
big kanye
yeah
all right but enough of the [ __ ]
by the way next week we're taking a week
off
we were trying to think i want to take a
vacation yeah but then we're like oh
let's go to hawaii did we talk about
this already was this somewhere else
i don't think you guys talked about it
i was like i want to go to hawaii oh i
want to go to europe i want to go to
mexico and then i'm like hold on a
[ __ ] second
these aren't vacations these are always
miserable works with so much headache
like you gotta find a flight and the
airport going to airports is worse than
any day of work you've ever done
unpacking right and then by the time you
get five days but you're work because
like the last two days you're worrying
because you're like oh i gotta pack my
[ __ ] up and go to the airport yeah every
time we go to israel we do that every
year it's not vacation let's be frank
it's pretty flippin far from vacation so
what i had this brilliant idea no one's
ever thought of it before
i was like you know what we're gonna do
i'm gonna turn off my phone
i'm not gonna look at social media i'm
not gonna do anything i'm just gonna
chill in my house
i'm gonna just relax
that's a [ __ ] vacation you remember
when you were kids summer vacation that
was a vacation
it was such a vacation that you used to
be like i'm ready to go back to school
yeah that's a vacation when you're like
i'm bored
i got when we decided to do that i all
of a sudden got so excited i can't wait
like that sounds amazing yeah i'm
relieved i was like relieved i just like
the idea of not using my phone right
nothing no emails no
anything
i've been feeling more and more
about how actually toxic
all the social media stuff going on and
all the like i mean how the frequent
checking of the phone and
like either looking for like news or
reddit post or twitter or instagram
something to satisfy
you're always searching for something
like interesting like where is it and
you've just you get less and less
reward and more and more time on and it
really feels like an addiction it's
become so depressing yeah it is
it's funny remember we used to make fun
of those videos
social media but that guy makes it more
they
the way that they do it that i don't
like like prince
where he's like look up from your phone
it's more about
he doesn't really approach it from a way
that
that's like this is an addiction and
let's use this in moderation it's like
look up
and don't look down look up on your
phone i don't know the way they do it's
annoying yeah i'm just a guy talking so
the way that i do it when i feel it it's
real
no i'm an [ __ ] he was right
he was ahead of the game
but i feel like now more than ever
people are starting to realize like man
this [ __ ] is kind of like an actual
problem all of a sudden yeah
yeah our intern ian he said he'd erased
all of his social media and he has a
little brother who says he uses
instagram even more and it's like a real
problem
interesting the kids who are younger
than us have like new problems yeah
because i grew up with the internet
but now these kids who are coming up now
were born with social media right yeah
and that is a whole new twisted
mind [ __ ] to grow up with
i don't know it's really lately it's
just depressing me like
instagram used to be my favorite me too
and now i'm like every time i open it i
get depressed i don't know why
facebook's been dead to me for a long
time but i still facebook was my first
social media but i still after all this
time i don't use it i still reflexively
go
type f in the browser go to facebook i
don't look at it for very long maybe
like
30 seconds
but i i hate being on facebook but i
still after all this time
it's to go to that weird habit reddit
started to get really bad for me
like i'll all sit in bed and waste an
hour just scrolling reddit and and in my
mind i'm like i don't want to be doing
this i could be doing anything else but
this but
spend an hour so so it used to be like
the j i i enjoyed it and i was in the
moment but now i'm wanting to be doing
something else but so you still do it
yeah it's weird it's so bad it's a weird
thing
it sounds like everyone is feeling it
too like especially lately yeah
what are they doing
because they know they're doing [ __ ] to
like manipulate you for sure you know
since facebook bought instagram i've
been reading stuff about how
they'll specifically under report likes
on your posts so that you will think
that it's underperforming and you'll
keep checking it my god out of
insecurity like how twisted how sick can
you be
when did they buy instagram they did it
secretly it happened like i don't know a
year ago
but there was longer than that how was
it yeah it was
but that was that was so smart of them
because that's why i hate instagram now
because it used to be my favorite one
they're getting more manipulative with
the stories the stories keep you on yeah
the i don't know and now they started
like the like thing
and they started switching the order
it's no longer chronological yeah i hate
that and so it's really all about
manipulating you
at any cost
no ethical consideration exactly
just to spend as much time on it as
possible
well anyway let's talk to kyle the
grandma [ __ ] i wonder what's his
social media like
well i'm really looking forward to that
vacation i'm gonna really just try to
unplug and what i'm gonna try i'm
looking in the chat right now and a lot
of people are saying they feel exactly
the same yeah i don't know there's
something in the air where just suddenly
we've gotten really this should be like
a national thing where everyone takes a
week off of everything damn that'd be
that'd be killer
next week
that'd be really cool next week guys do
it let's all do it together seriously
like leave the calls on if there's an
emergency people can call you sure but
no text no anything yeah
i'm really looking forward to it and and
one thing i want to focus on is like
just doing things that are i know are
good for me during that time like
i'm not going to work i'm going to enjoy
myself i'm going to play video games and
stuff but i'm not going to like drink
i'm not going to order pizza i'm not
going to what i want to do is focus on
like exercising every morning because
usually i make excuses like oh i don't
have time i have too much [ __ ] yeah
right gotta work i'm i'm busy browsing
reddit for an hour every morning so what
i want to try to do is like take care of
stuff around the house
get in the habit of exercising every
morning eating healthy and just having
like a holistic experience of like
wellness
i love that idea
so we'll see where we're at so yeah i'm
looking forward to that
um
so no podcast next week um
but hey
you know what
okay let's get back on track
um so kyle the cougar champ
a lot of you probably know who he is a
lot of you probably don't so i'm gonna
play a little clip here to bring you
guys all up to speed who who those who
are and not familiar with your boy the
great my name is kyle i'm 31 i live in
pittsburgh and i'm addicted to dating
older women
where's the [ __ ] mouse button much
older women
couldn't find it
all right like 60 70 80 year old older
women
i love everything about older women i
love the smell i love the feel
i love the
mentality have something to say no i
just i love that it says i love the
smell yeah i love the smell it's like i
want to actually ask them what do they
smell like
what is what is how do they smell like
what is the smell
because when i think of older women i
think like like musky closet like closet
of old yeah like a stinky house that
i guess he likes that maybe like you
smell of old socks i don't know
i love dentures women you know you
seriously
ladies i promise you telling your man
that you have dentures will not turn
them off it'll put a smile on his face
he'll put a smile on his pants
okay i want to know who wrote that line
for him
hold on the dentures
dentures will
put a smile in your pants
so anyway this guy he's really
enthusiastic and actually what we found
out after we made this video is that
while he's dating a 91 year old
currently or i don't know if she's in
one of the videos at least but he we
later discovered he makes porn he's a
pornographer
and he uh
he [ __ ] old ladies on camera i don't
know if that's his primary business but
i have so many questions for him
so with that being said let's let's
bring him out man kyle uh let's grab him
kyle the cougar champion are you there
hey it's good to be here man i'm kind of
under the weather i have a cold but um
yeah good to be here you sound great man
don't worry about it but
uh first of all let me just say what a
honor and thrill it is to be in the
presence of the one and only cougar
champion is that some is that a title
you've given yourself or was that
anointed by others
that was something um when i decided i
was going to do porn i had to pick a
name and that's just the name i came up
with there's a hell of an echo while i'm
talking to you oh maybe it's because it
is so loud oh here we go in our room
yeah let me fix that dan he's got uh
feedback
can you hear me dan
yeah you know what here let me uh it's
kind of loud in there yeah yeah a little
bit louder
all right kyle go ahead try that now
okay is that better i can hear you
that's much better okay okay great
so um
you had this great well first of all
what is it actually you're dating a 91
year old right
okay um at the time that video was
shooting they they portrayed it or they
wrote it as a part and her and i were
never dating we were you know we were
having saturdays
um but we were never together i rarely
ever get involved on you know
monogamy exclusivity with anyone that's
very rare for me
so
i guess well did you were you having sex
with the 91 year old
oh yeah the later in the video the my
transition video yeah we were [ __ ]
for a while and you know what i'm
talking about because you saw the um my
my twitter page trigger champion the
point i was all of that oh was that with
her i i honestly had to i couldn't hang
for that long dude i'm sorry there was a
video she had some tats around her
nipples i was like damn this lady's
[ __ ]
really seen some [ __ ] oh no that's
that's someone different like you're
talking about shirley the one that
wasn't the um that was in the strange
addiction that was
actually no well let me ask you this
when you're when you're slamming on a on
a 91 year old are you more do you have
to be more gentle because i know you you
have quite a bit of range you'll go
anywhere from like 70 to 100 i don't
know where you draw the line but like
are you more gentle when you when you
slam dunk on older ladies
i would say no you know the video that
you posted um in the piece you get on me
where it showed me
there's like 91. yeah
okay we've done porn together with her i
never went easy i never took these i
are you ever concerned about damaging
the goods i mean what wrong thrust could
be it could be a
could be the last one
well actually as of recently yes i am
because i've sent two women to the
hospital
literally no oh
you broke [ __ ] dude tell me about
that situation
okay so with this one lady and she
claimed that she hadn't had sex and say
like 15 years she was still married so
we were we went out a couple of times my
second time with this hotel we're
drinking and whatnot
um we got down like i did that one move
we put our legs like way back we felt
like our knees
when we got to the hospital the doctors
looked up inside her and they say there
was a tear in the back of her [ __ ]
looked like a smiley face so they had to
stitch her up we couldn't do anything
for like six weeks how did that make you
feel did you feel bad or accomplished
a little bit of both actually
has anyone ever died while while you've
been in a relationship with them
yes actually marge died at 94. um connie
was on the website she passed away last
year um linda's passed away damn um
when someone passes away like are you do
you go to the funeral huh
um i've actually one time i got a phone
call from my grandson the way that was
91 of you showed the video of me and
heart kissing her grandson called me up
and was just like you know and i just
want to say thanks for you showing her a
good time glad
um does it
how do you feel like when when they pass
away and is that like a like what's the
what's the emotion that you experience
because you you got to know when you get
when you get with these ladies that
that's a strong possibility right that
they
they're
they're on an expiry
there's been date than one that happened
only two of them really hit me i mean
the one in the video where i was kissing
margin and i felt bad when she died but
i actually felt bad for not feeling as
bad as i thought
the one that really got to me the one
that really got to me was connie um
is the one from the video
sorry connie's the one from the video
right the one that was too young for you
damn wow
well uh
damn doug tell me about
she was a lawful man
together
she was just incredible
so when you mentioned that dentures put
a smile on your pants like was that
something that that you offered to the
camera or was that something that the
producers helped you dream up
as much as i hate to admit it that was
just total ad love
and
it's i love how you say that line of
like i guarantee you all men love your
dentures do you think that all men want
to [ __ ] old ladies or
i think um i think
once you experience a gum job
definitely standard is that what it's
all about what's your experience yeah
yeah once you give a gun job so if
that's a new standard so describe a gum
job to me i mean
it's like it's getting a blow job but
like there's no there's no chance of
welcome everybody to the h3 podcast live
today's episode is sponsored by stitch
fix Dollar Shave Club and the black tux
today's guest is the mega not just he's
not a superstar he's a megastar ninja
the twitch streamer and pro gamer and
fortnight phenomenon
many of you probably know who ninja is
but for those of you who don't know let
me give you some numbers to kind of put
in perspective what we're dealing with
here so I was checking ok well he's a
twitch streamer let's start there at the
at the beginning of the year he had a
just under a million subscribers that
was just a few short months ago and a
million subscribers on twitch makes him
one of the biggest channels on twitch
she was a big deal
fast forward to today since that moment
he's up over 6 million subscribers on
twitch the biggest channel on twitch by
far now he's broken all the streaming
records he first broke the streaming
record what for the most concurrent
viewers at one time when he played with
the Drake
yes Drake mr. uh hot whatever you guys
know drink hey mister yeah exactly
shed the sweater I love Jake he's the
greatest so jealous I get to sit across
from someone who's played with Drake
that sounds bad
I like I like him for it I just have him
on to get to Drake I'm thinking about
Trane I lost my dream he he broke the
record one who's playing with Drake the
previous record was dr. disrespect when
he came back from his break he had like
three hundred thirty eight hundred
thousand concurrent viewers which was
enormous
so when Nietzsche blasts on the scene
with Drake they get six hundred thousand
concurrent viewers this is unbelievable
four alive people sitting there watching
like okay and then he broke his own
record again this last weekend when he
was in Vegas putting on some really cool
event that I want to talk about later
with him but that event broke his
own record was 660,000 live viewers his
YouTube channel which is highlights of
his Twitter stream is unbelievable he
posts a highlight every day and these
are getting like 4 to 7 million views
every day in the past month in the past
30 days on YouTube he's gained 3.2
million new subscribers and has 200
million views in the past month in the
past 30 days I've never seen anything
like it
it's unbelievable it's exciting it's
cool to see that that somebody could
take it this far could blow up this much
it's it's those numbers like don't make
sense I've never seen like never seen
anything like it
3.2 million news today he's streaming
with Drake was the day we did our live
show at the improv and we streamed it
really I'm pretty sure that wasn't what
was happening and we were like wow that
was great it was so much fun and then
after the show well apparently there was

appreciate you you're the best I love
you dad cut me off because I don't stop
know how to stuff
what up pimps we've got the man here
yeah boy ninja aka Tyler Blevins yes
let's play where's the origin of beloved
uh I get that everyone so mama it's like
Welsh my mother yeah well [ __ ] means a
little wolf oh oh yeah man that's
wonderful they're cool
yeah I really said maybe that's to be my
gamertag instead or a little wolf you
know so we were in showing you before
you came in just talking about all the
the unbelief like unprecedented numbers
you've been smashing yeah I've never
seen anyone
I mean I've not been on YouTube the
longest but I've been around for a
little bit now like five years now and
I've never seen in all my time someone
come up so hard yeah so fast right I
mean first of all how has that affected
your life because it seems like you were
popular but in the past four months
according like oh yeah unbelievable
so with how long I've been like
streaming and doing all this content
stuff like that the the massive growth
really hasn't changed much because it's
like in my own way I kind of was like
relevant essentially so it's just really
cool to see to see how girl like looking
at the statistics we're looking at like
numbers and how quickly other people
have grown to and to just kind of like
smash all of that and is amazing it's
mean it's yeah it's unbelievable yeah
and nothing's really changed honestly
the wife and I still have the same
schedule if anything we just kind of I
mean I'm actually trying to stream more
right so that you know there's more
content on like the Instagram clip right
and everything so no I mean coming from
YouTube we had mentioned the intro but
you you have like 3.3 million
subscribers in the past 30 days
yes we're averaging nine every nine days
is a million subscribers about 100 left
had 120 a day and those are just clips
from your twitch streams they are not
yes they are not very rarely will I try
to so like in a live stream if I wanted
to I could do like okay this game is
gonna be tips and tricks so I'll
literally intro it in to the live stream
and then make it more like professional
it's fun fact actually just tested that
for the very first time doing a light
machine gun only this new gun that came
out in four night I was like okay I'm
dude tips and tricks this game right
it's gonna be great like I think I was
thinking 10 million views like in like a
couple of like days like two days and it
actually didn't do the great great it's
not like it's like right in the middle
of kind of where a lot of my just
pre-recorded like ripped content is and
so that actually it was something that
blew my mind
I think people like the authentic
experience yeah
want the real deal they want to see the
crazy [ __ ] that's happening again
exactly and I think that in my opinion I
think a lot a lot of a lot of youtubers
who are trying to like do the the
YouTube live content or their YouTube
content that is planned and they come
over to twitch and it is live it's there
there's like a disconnect there it's ah
you're right
yeah it's hard it's it's a highly
different world and it is this is live
yeah we still suck at it but it's like
the whole lot well we've streamed video
games before yes it can be revoking
brutal like Ustream how long do you
usually stream for oh so the schedule is
like 9:30 is when I'll start in the
morning and then I play until like fours
like six hours 600 hours and then I'll
take a nice three four-hour break with
the wife and dogs and then or family we
have like family nights and stuff like
that too and then come back on around
like seven o'clock central and stream
into like three two in the morning and
then so it's like it's minimum like
twelve hours a day is what we're trying
to be and then I'll sleep for like less
than six hours or seven hours do you
ever get like I would stream for like
five hours a couple times and I was like
I'm [ __ ] done for the week like I'm
not making YouTube videos you hung on in
bed I'm done for the week yeah no it's
it's it's just like I've been doing it
for so long so maybe I built up a
tolerance or something like that an
immunity to like that well it seems like
you really love it oh dude that's that
helps really yeah
and being honestly being good at the
games my worst days where I'm also the
taxed the most are when I'm not doing
well
right and I think that's because you
know it just sucks and also like
mentally draining I'm kind of worried
about I didn't perform today like it's
not okay don't happen often which like
that's a lot of pressure too yes because
you're the best quote-unquote you think
you're the best for tonight I would
never say that no no you have to like
not not like I've never said it because
I think I am but it sounds bad yeah yeah
I know right alright now if you if you
put yourself there like you you're
already kept all downhill
exactly you saying oh I'm saying and
also I can't learn like at that point
it's kind of like oh I'm the best
there's no room for growth right and
that's not well from my point of view
when I watch your videos in your stream
I'm just like what the [ __ ] that's the
gold man but like also that must come
with an extraordinary amount of stress
like you said you streaming and you're
having off days and you feel bad so does
that stress to always perform like so
good how do you cope with that
it really just
it's again like those days don't really
happen too often so I got them really
once every like two or three weeks I'll
have just like a really bad day where
I'll wind only a couple games and you
know it's great actually just having
such a supportive community because I'll
get like a donor or someone in stem it's
just a hey man like nice to know you're
human like that is important you know
and I'll do my best also just be like
hey guys even I suck sometimes like cuz
I'll have you know ten games in a row
where I just died off the start and I'm
like but I'm a very good like at
resetting as well so like sometimes I'll
have like a bad first hour or something
like that and like one time I joked
around and I completely like restarted
my stream essentially I didn't thought
the intro screen back in I laughed I
came downstairs play the song and I was
just like hey guys what's up first game
of the day here we go and I'd up winning
that game we're like 20 kills or
something like that did you make a
conscious effort to get really good at
the game or was it just I mean you're
professional gamer you've been gaming
for what like 10 years oh my entire life
but professionally like seven eight okay
when fortnight came out what was it did
you have kind of a feeling of like this
is gonna be a big game what was your
process of being like I'm gonna be
really good at this game or are you just
good at all games I'm good at all games
and that's just from being a gamer mine
right my entire life yeah it's literally
what I do so and I played a lot when I
was growing up a lot of RPG games you
know the teenage Ninja Turtles legend of
legaia Legend of Dragoon and Final
Fantasy and then halo 1 Goldeneye these
Super Smash Bros I literally played
every game imaginable you know written
dude road rash I don't this amazing man
squeal back dude it was amazing run a
motorcycle and you could like buy and
upgrade your motorcycles and like you
had like you could like whip like you
know with chains like you're the other
guys next to you it was actually super
fun but no yeah playing all those games
just kind of made me you were you were
prepared from all angles yes yes sir d
and also what people don't yet for night
man
it didn't blow up right away by any
means ever no I was I kept my eye on it
I always check out my chat right and
when they're asking you to play a game
or play with someone in the back of my
head I'm always like okay like this
needs to be there's some research on
this and either watch it or you know
watch this guy's content and see if I
could be someone to collab with and
stuff and the game was not being
received well by a lot of top
broadcasters
I was watching that they were
complaining about it oh it's too
cartoony oh it's not fun it's not no
scale it's not and then but when I'm
watching it myself I'm like this this
looks really entertaining they're really
fun so I waited for there was like an AR
update where they like increase the
accuracy or whatever and I was like okay
this is my I kept telling my chat like I
will play it just soon I will play it
soon I will play it soon and then
finally I switched from pub G love the
game was not very good at it in terms of
the shooting is not the difficult part
it's building and that meta kind of grew
over time and I figured that out how
important it was to obviously block
shots from people shooting you and then
once I figure that out I think that's
what I'm missing I'm so bad at the game
yeah the whole fort aspect you know
penis gallery I literally love that ya
know it's building is literally the most
important thing the way that you just
like well good players they'll like
build a whole [ __ ] tower yeah like
jumping and building on it I can't be I
can't get it oh yeah I know that is that
that's the part that really takes a
minute to get down so you'll find that
there aren't that many talented players
like in every game so if you just build
simple little structures you can win
that's enough yeah it is it is but again
if you're gonna run into a Mira
you know another top player that is like
trying actually game lame-o you're dunk
on yeah yeah it's very easy to tell if
somebody's not good I think for
tonight's such an interesting game
because well if you look at if you
compare it to pub G which is just a
pretty simple shooter with a really cool
it's actually super basic it's super
basic it's got a really cool concept and
a cool map yes that concept is basic
yeah and fortnight took it then next
step further by introducing another
element of strategy yeah it went like
Super Saiyan like God like like vulture
and say turned it and real I catch a
game of chess yes it really was
so like the a lot of people are like oh
you know built like pub G requires so
much more skill because you know there's
no building you know and it's like wrong
it's exact opposite like pub G someone
sees you from a mile away with a times
15 scope yeah it can hide in a building
and kill you and have the and be
completely it's not difficult to shoot a
gun and hit somebody like gun skill is
not is never the main reason that
someone's talented at a game it is
literally their decision making like you
know next level stuff what are they
thinking ten steps ahead and pop G you
and not saying the game does obviously
require talent but less of less of it in
my opinion there's a lot less of a skill
gap yes where you can get this good or
as good like with you if you were trying
everything if I try every game and I
don't I a lot of games for me throwing
you know the impulse bombing in aiding
myself 50 feet in the air and trying to
like swag on someone with a noscope like
if I did not do that I only went mega
trihard I'd win like 90% of my games it
really 1,000,000%
I'll and I'll ant a 1 million percent
Elena tilted towers dude like I would
never land there I would try it I would
land in very outskirt and like sides
like I died mainly because I other
messing around too much i under arrest
or entertaining you're not playing
exactly I find that balance yeah and
some days the worst days are when I try
to goof off too soon I don't get wins
and then now I'm trying but now I'm kind
of in my own head and then I'm not gonna
win and then oh yeah weird so we touched
briefly on like how fort net wasn't
really that popular frighten it where he
didn't really come from because I
remember when doctor disrespect was here
yes we asked him about fortnight because
we just had Brendan green the right Bob
G crater on like a week before cool and
it was like fortnight was like this cool
little game that was kind of just riding
the Battle Royale wait up and then all
the Select suddenly it was like the most
popular game in the world who so I mean
I think that it stems from really being
free-to-play right and that's it's kind
of like League of Legends yeah perfect
you literally if you want if you want
this is why I don't know a lot of people
aren't doing it like concept of like
League of Legends kind of did that free
to play in game skin purchases are where
they make the revenue game and it's a
solid game I think what it was someone
very recent we had a conversation with
foreign it does not feel free to play
absolutely not and that is that's
actually shroud it was shroud I was
watching trout stream and he was playing
a game that literally was like a puppy
knockoff completely like 100% and it's
free-to-play yeah and and the comment
that he made was like for Annette does
not feel free to play doesn't and
neither did League and correct that's
why it was so successful
oh yeah everyone recently had a
conversation I mean a lot of people like
if there I mean like taking pictures all
the time in in the airport and like this
one guy his dad was just like like oh
like I gotta buy it I should buy it like
it sounds cool I'm like down-low
it's free it's almost the that's how hmm
it's how we can go viral yeah it's so
accessible you can even compare it to
like basketball or baseball or football
in a way because you don't need to you
just need a ball using you can play yes
it needs to be the same way if the game
ever wants to be comparable on that
level agreed like you cannot like unless
the game is literally God's gift to the
earth like you cannot expect a game a
destiny that's a $60 it's got it's a
huge barrier oh yeah
yes yes especially since Destiny's like
what is actually on everything besides
mobile and stuff like that yeah that
just came out on PC right for two but
yeah ma'am can't expect people to just
buy it's interesting he bucks a lot of
money I think a lot of people are like I
don't want free-to-play games to on the
other hand because they're like I don't
want a bunch of trash and I don't really
access rights right and I don't want to
have to pay for [ __ ] but the way that
they do it is so perfect unoffensive
well they have a they have the single
player you have to pay tip if you want
to yes but totally unnecessary
yeah I mean it's been actually super fun
I thought of dude I loved it
I seen a lot of videos in it I mean it's
great like a tower defense man have you
played it I mess around with it a little
bit I actually try not to because
there's less like there's no delay
there's no jump fatigue on the that
which always when you jump in and you
like it's gonna pollute your it does
like I would jump in the survival one
and it's like instant like I can tell
there was no connection involved
whatsoever like oh my god and I switched
over it's like playing on it's a claw
three up dude halo three yes halo three
welcome everybody to a very special
episode of the 420 blazin Angley podcast
there's nothing special about it and we
are not smoking and we don't smoke and
we don't encourage people to smoke
because that's an illusion it's an
illegal activity and can get you in lots
of trouble not just with the government
but with your parents today's episode is
sponsored by on it me undies hems and
seat geek this is um I'm super excited
announced this on Monday we've got ninja
the twitch megastar joining us leave
your questions on the subarray he's
coming in at 2 p.m. PST I believe on
Monday this Monday
I am freaking super pumped to meet and
talk with ninja and then also I just
want to say a very happy national walk
out day which coincides with 4/20 which
is a happy coincidence right let's go
hey let's go protest gun violence
I'm blazed how did they both fall in the
same day I don't know
also Hitler's birthday apparently so Wow
busy day Columbine happen today
oh wait yeah I was never clear was the
guy who did the dudes who did Columbine
did they choose Hitler's birthdays
specifically or was it a coin
can you guys research let's celebrate
the biggest mass murdering [ __ ] that
ever exists
let's celebrate his life here's our
favorite 4/20 video this was by one this
guy it makes great content I know if
he's still making videos on your
computer this guy's a great man he's got
some real classics oh yeah he was making
videos back back back back in the day
when we were just walking around
shirtless this guy was getting it here
enjoy this guy's it it's that time buy
on your computer
oh you're never gonna believe what there
you go this guy's great check out on
your computer man I hope he's doing well
I wish him the best and I thank him for
all the laughs and all the gaps and all
the goofs and all the I'm not gonna say
the G word to you but that my head it's
uh that video is so well timed with the
mom walking the mom walking in and then
imagine if both his watch and the
microwave because you know sometimes
it's one minute off ruins it did you
ever did you guys celebrate 4/20 in his
role at all mmm I didn't even know about
it I don't know maybe people do did you
even know people who smoked it all in
Israel yeah but not a lot but I think
everyone does smoke I just was like ELA
ghosts don't tell my parents that weed
exists he's like don't tell him it
exists we made that video about how we
used to be drug dealers she's like don't
show that to my parents they don't know
they don't know that weed exists oh that
one was yeah it was afraid of their
reaction and then my mom was just she
just didn't mention it I think maybe you
think she saw it but was just like I
don't even know how to address this yeah
it's funny when I was in college UC
Santa Cruz 4/20 was like the biggest day
of the year really it's so ridiculous in
a way like thinking back like everyone
would go out and there's this meadow
it's called the meadow and everybody
from the whole school from the whole
town will pour into this meadow there's
thousands of people and you would see
the most obscene [ __ ] you would see
people who would roll a massive joint
with like a pound of weed and there they
would have like ten different shoots and
like 20 people would be hitting it at
once the cops would show up and there
they would be like
I don't I don't know what to do about
this because it's like a couple like
five cops show up this was before it was
illegal I mean this was like ten years
ago now it was it was before it was
legal but it was like was the T not
murder okay we did it wasn't really a
something that mattered because it was
just eccentric has a reputation like
that glaze right
so the teachers participated there was
probably some but when you have
thousands of people out there and
they're there peacefully exist you're
not causing problem its heart like what
actually can you're gonna start you can
come out the riot gear and start like
you know clubbing people because they're
having a marijuana cigarette so the
police handled it right but like just
this whole notion of glorifying weed
somehow I don't understand it people
don't glorify other drugs
why does we get glorified it's weird
it's kind of like you're in the club or
you're not people think about weed is
like this miracle it's like a miracle
like God God gave us this plant and it
solves every problem I'm enlightened I'm
chill natural it's all natural just
grows up from the earth and also it's it
doesn't harm you that's what they say
it's a perfect beautiful dress I
actually I personally would say to
people out there who haven't tried it
who will probably one day try it I would
say be cautious of this drug because
I've been more [ __ ] up mentally as a
result of smoking weed than any other
drug I've taken and I've taken a lot of
drugs and I'm not encouraging anyone to
take drugs you know make decisions for
yourself but of all of them that I've
taken weed has been the one that's like
[ __ ] me up the most I've had like bad
trips on and just been like mentally in
outer space in a bad way yeah I I also
have trouble with it whenever I try it I
just get like so paranoid and not I
can't enjoy anything I just write weird
like but I think it really depends on
the person you know yeah I think I wish
that I enjoy like I see some people who
are like um
freaking loving it but I don't know if
it's real I don't know if it's real I
think it through you think it's real
yeah I feel like weed is something you
have to smoke for like a full decade
before you can be like I'm just at peace
now with this drug the freakin blast me
in outer space there's also studies this
turned to like the anti weed I'm not
trying to like pain you could I don't I
don't care
do whatever you want my parents smoked
everyone I know smokes yeah my parents
and all my siblings smoke on a daily
basis so I'm not I'm just saying I don't
know why it gets put up on a pedestal
like nobody goes and buys a bottle of
like whiskey and it's like yeah man this
is gonna cure all your problems dude
you're gonna forget about all your
troubles comes at a price
that's a drug all right out there what
about wine would they say that there's
like a wine that's a lush lushes what a
lush is someone who abuses wine no I
mean would you do think there's a wine
like Club where people like idolize wine
the people are interested in wine
alright cuz there's like wine collector
is right but it's more about February
Jefferson has like a wine room in their
house yeah but wine isn't a well
alcohols the drug yeah and people don't
I mean yeah but people don't fetishize
it in the same way as like weed I think
whatever this conversation sucks anyway
to everyone out there who is blaze have
a great time who's just paid taxes hey
on to another topic oh yeah they said
that the Columbine was a coincidence
isn't that strange it was a
coincidentally on Hitler's birthday from
the Guardian the fact that the attack
took place on Hitler's birthday was a
coincidence boys had decided on 19th of
April the anniversary of the botched
government siege at Waco Texas okay
something else at least they're
celebrating yeah
oh wait that's it it says that it had to
be pushed back 24-hour
oh so I should actually contain I should
finish reading just lots of cherries
stuff 74 76 people perishing in a fire
all the good stuff okay
who's paid taxes we did taxes man I love
paying taxes you know what I wish about
taxes I wish there was a receipt because
I paid we're paying now about is race it
in like a hundred PDF with a hundred
pages really of they tell you how you
make your money
yeah they spent the money and that for
you that you paid I think that I should
be entitled to know where my [ __ ]
money went is that this would be great
at this point we're paying about forty
five percent of our income they're
making almost as much as we are
what the hell what I want is a receipt I
want to say your money was used to buy
two missiles you know three sandwiches
for the president yeah the gardener's at
the White House I don't know but like
there should be a breakdown of like
welfare you know like infrastructure
military health care I want to know I
guess you can find online but I'd like
to know would it be cool if you could
vote for how your money's spent
yeah so you pay your taxes you say you
you give them whatever fifty thousand
dollars in a year and then you get to
choose off with your money like hey I
want to I want this to go to health care
I want this to go to infrastructure and
you can decide as a citizen how you want
the government to spend your money won't
that be a cool way of like actually
deciding what's important so this point
we're spending like 50 percent of our
money on military I mean what what gives
dude I don't even understand the whole
military and the war here because it's
so weird how it's like you and war but
knowing something here it's all over
there right yours because it will in
Israel you feel when you're a poor you
understand why right there
but I was thinking that it's too like
recently you I'm sure
one heard the government with UK and
France bombed cereal in retaliation for
them using chemical weapons and I was
thinking I'm sitting here trying to be
like how do I feel about this like it's
a good thing it's a bad thing
yeah but then the the honest-to-god
truth I think is like who [ __ ]
actually in this world that is so
complexed I'm sitting out here and like
my comfortable life out in Los Angeles
how could I ever actually know what what
actually is going on there
how can i ordinary citizen actually
understand what the hell is going on in
Syria and why we're bombing them and why
have we been in perpetual war for two
decades I don't understand that's so
weird the concept how can I know how can
I know you I feel like to understand you
would have to have privileged
information or at least spent dedicating
like a full time amount of of
researching this and trying to
understand it and going there and seeing
what it's like in Syria you know let's
see what's actually going on there who
the [ __ ] knows what they're like how can
I have an opinion about it
people get so passionate one way or the
other about like oh it's good oh it's
bad it's probably bad
anytime someone bombs anything it's
probably bad it's just especially when
it becomes like related to politics I
feel like no one knows anything except
what their side right said on the news
you know right yeah yeah it's crazy I
mean I think we all have to understood
the internet and all these back channels
and all these countries scheming and
everyone's got I'll tell you our
alternative motives I honestly don't
know what to think about it but the
thing was that I found interesting was
that Trump he was ran on this whole
thing of being like America first I
don't give a [ __ ] and he railed on Obama
when Obama got involved in Syria yeah
and he was railing on Obama about don't
get involved in Syria and so it was just
seemed I had a character that all of a
sudden he's dropped bombs because that
was like his whole identity was America
for
let's not let's not be the police of the
world let's let the world sort of sum up
I thought it was just interesting that
all of a sudden he's so I wonder what
did he see what did he learn that
changed his mind so significantly
because I know his base a lot of people
who supported him were really upset with
that decision from the bombs here and I
wonder was there something he learned or
saw that we don't have access to it was
like where he was like this is important
yeah who could know who can decide they
did bomb chemical from what I read
they'd only bombed chemical weapons
facilities and research centers
associated with the chem the production
of chemical weapons they didn't bomb
like schools or hospitals or anything
insane like that and apparently they
also called war Russia through
backchannels and warned them so they
could get their people out which is a
good idea but that was something that
you used to criticize - all right don't
don't give in it's easy you know what
they say the crown the crown lays heavy
on the head mm-hmm it's easy to sit in
the peanuts gallery and [ __ ] all over
this poor son of a [ __ ] in charge
being the president it's got to be one
of the worst jobs in the whole freaking
world mm-hmm
that isn't that is a job for a very
specific unusual type of person
especially someone can do it good Trump
love him or hate him he was the biggest
mudslinger ever another Lee's president
he's doing all this the same stuff that
Obama did I'm not saying that as a
criticism of him like now he's bombing
Syria and he was saying to Obama don't
give away your plans ahead of time but
he did both of those things and I just
makes me think that he probably learned
something there when he understood oh
this is the right way to do it and
there's probably just so many codes and
things you have to follow right that I
wanted stuff I wanted an how much
decision they actually have you know
mm-hmm that's another who knows what the
[ __ ] knows I'm just a guy not even a
political science major I read reddit
like let's just be real with how how
much we understand about what's going on
this world you reading already is more
than I do I don't even I don't even go
there
I think we first need to acknowledge
that we don't know anything because
there's nothing I found myself doing
this to so it's fine happens everyone
but there's nothing worse than somebody
who has an a basic understanding of
something who's just browsed that title
and then we'll go out and argue in favor
of that and I find myself doing that too
and sometimes I'll be like wait I don't
what am I talking about I don't know
anything we don't know anything you
can't that's natural I don't know yeah
you can't just walk on it well I don't
know anything so I can't say anything
about yeah yeah yeah I know but but that
whole drive to want to like defend your
team is being used against us mm-hmm and
now like the Democratic Party is suing
Donald Trump did you know that it just
happened I think today or yesterday the
Democrats are suing Donald Trump for for
working with Russia to undermine the
election or something I don't know but
it's like we've got everything so
divided you you almost forget that were
were neighbors we're living in the same
country but it's like all-out war I
don't know what I guess that's how it's
better that way for everybody it's like
I don't know what's better
well like the powers that be it's almost
better right that that we're so divided
in a way because you focus more on like
how much you hate them then about
actually solving any problems it makes
you easier to control this is just a
conspiracy I don't know but it's been
like this for so long and no one's made
any meaningful efforts to actually
reconcile and it's just two parties it's
not that complicated you got one like
our disagreements are not that great but
somehow everybody [ __ ] hates each
other got CNN and Fox News and they
[ __ ] hate each other it's nuts I
don't know
it's like bro we're all we're neighbors
we got it we're sharing like you know
the thing is like when you're in a hat
when you were growing up and you get in
a brutal fight with your sibling you
still sit at dinner table together and
have dinner and then the next day forget
about it but I don't know how deep the
actual hatred for each other is going I
don't know
if it is or if it's like after the next
election or maybe there's a president
everyone like someone forget about I
don't know I know how bad it is it's
hard to tell I don't know anything look
at me trying to get all [ __ ] serious
conversation I feel like we smoked weed
I'm so blazed that would be the wouldn't
that be the best twist ever
all right here's speaking of politics
and all this [ __ ] you guys want to
see some scary [ __ ] I I've been meaning
to watch this for a long long time and I
just haven't had the opportunity here on
the podcast because we have so many
guests lately but you guys probably saw
this this is just unbelievable
talk about a threat to democracy and
some real 1984 [ __ ] look at this Eastern
Michigan communities we are extremely
proud with the quality that was
journalism that CBS 4 News produces
plaguing our country the sharing of
biased and false news has become all too
common on social media more alarming
some media outlets publish the same fake
story so a little background there these
are all owned by a huge conglomerate
media conglomerate called Sinclair and
they started buying up tons of local
news organizations and they starting to
use them they give them these forced
memos that they have to read you have to
read this verbatim word for word and
it's just it's this unbelievable
propaganda like the people who are
watching these local news don't know
that there this memo is forced from
someone upstairs who owns it seems like
it's an anecdote by these people you
watch it it seems like that person is
just it doesn't sound like they were all
they would all be reading something that
was like why would they this is a very
personal collection with the local news
those are your people right and so and
and then even further they're talking
about like one-sided news that is
corrupting them
ah cracy all the meanwhile while having
hundreds of people read this document
it's like it's actual doublethink you
remember that concert from 1984 or you
can both contradict yourself and believe
it at the same time wildin being aware
its actual doublethink
you can't criticize people for one sided
news and propaganda when you're
disseminating this for hundreds of look
it's it's it's actual doublethink it's
scary it's this is horrifying watch this
this is state media this is like what
you'll see in China or Russia when the
when the government owns the median I
have to say whoever edited this together
incredible that is a feat of
unbelievable so well like it's perfect
not just that editing but like actually
finding yeah the divide of all these
morning shows that this must have taken
unimaginable work to accomplish this is
extremely dangerous to our democracy
this is extremely dangerous to our
democracy love watching all these
Talking Heads you don't even know what
they're talking about or give a [ __ ]
acting like they care this is extremely
dangerous to our democracy this is
extremely dangerous to our democracy
this is extremely dangerous to our
democracy this is extremely dangerous to
our democracy this is extremely
dangerous to our democracy this it's
like they're all just doing an audition
right right the the balls the
welcome everybody to another episode of
the H Street podcast live if you're on

previous day if you want to watch your
life to get on over to twitch.tv forward
slash is redirected you can watch the
live next time but not this time
because it's a recording like a song and
dance with the Cape yeah that's funny
you should do that for next time
today's episode is sponsored by quip
audible and MVM T movement thank you to
them
today's guest is the great and wonderful
pioneer of YouTube hardly Morenstein
that's got to be one of the most Jewish
names I've ever heard props to him
Harley Morenstein he's got he's like a
he's like a Jewish warrior like when you
like he's a big guy and he's got like a
big beard and and like because when
you think about a Jew you usually think
about like like a guy who looks like me
you know like a doe a little boy but
they're what had to be Jewish warriors
cuz you think back to the biblical
stories of like King King George what
was the guy's name that's a restaurant
what's this guy's name the old Jewish
King he was a warrior the old King David
yeah so King David was apparently
kicking ass back in the day so you know
that there's some warrior blood in the
Jewish line it's not a meat but it isn't
some and he happens to be a warrior Jew
is what I mean to say he seems really
don't know warrior vibe yeah there's
like like an Israel there's like a yeah
my name is Mort steed but then there's
like warriors in Israel you have
everything right it's American I guess
it's really American like in Israel I
wasn't thinking what is the the Jewish
stereotype like inside Israel you have
different stereotypes right right right
right here I've learned there's so much
like more going on the American Jew is
like oh I need to call the electrician
to pull to put in this light bulb what
are the stereotypes in Israel it's I
don't know there's like really dumb ones
but it's more like depending on like
Ashkenazi or Safari
so you guys who don't know Ashkenazi is
European Jew Sephardic is Middle Eastern
Jew like near Arabic almost kind of like
how you have here and I don't know
what's politically correct here by like
how there's like like black people will
have shut it down at times that black
people shut it down
there's theory there some white people
right sorry white people have got their
wall like this cuz their asses be so
high that's one of my favorite ones from
Eddie Murphy good sorry whatever so what
but I'm actually really curious about
what are the stereotypes about Sephardic
and Ashkenazi Jews I don't worry all
right are not as good with cooking or
like they won't make enough that's true
that's not a ton of food there's no such
thing as like running out of food right
and I skin eyes is like don't put like
don't comment on many people they're
cheaper is that part of it because I
feel like that's real yeah what else you
got mMmmm that can't be the only one
like it's interesting I think
everybody's friend is the other night
okay but there's like a stereotype that
there too so I love that even amongst
the Jews in Israel there's one sect
that's really - it's like all gays are
cheap but the Yemenites they're super
cheap watch out for those guys it's it's
just it's it's fascinating to think that
like everybody thinks about Jews in this
way but then when you go to Israel when
everyone's Jewish you have all these sub
stereotypes it just kind of shows how
stupid it all is
it is really dumb and like no one our
age really talks about this stuff
anymore it's like all this stuff is
there any other interesting ones because
I think it's great well what do you what
do people think about the the that the
Sephardic Jews a lot of times they go
together with like the obviously minify
time explain what our skin is our seam
is like a jersey Shore's a Jew
it's like a a what
going on I got my pop collar forget
about it I just got herpes the other day
forget I just do Lola rubbing alcohol I
got my dick and another girl forget
about it
eight but on the muse Rock a and they
dance they said I guarantee nobody's
upset about making fun of our soon a
okay anyway
that was a nice little any other
stereotypes that we can talk about here
any other people we can piss off I am
super excited about this weekend we are
going tomorrow hopefully
with with post to Coachella backstage
hopefully like we just before coming
here you asked if we want to come he's
like I got tickets for you guys the
thing with post is that like whenever he
invites you somewhere you know you're

helpless journey because like he'll get

war you you mean your own it's like hey

space it's exciting it's fun it's a
thrill right
I'm really excited never been to
Coachella no I hope I don't know what to
expect what what what I imagine is that
well there's like I guess there's two
portions there's like the public area
and then there's like the backstage yeah
the artist area that'd be cool I'm gonna
harass I'm gonna harass people like I'm
gonna be that guy who's taking pictures
with all the famous people who shouldn't

over and it stalls the h3 app which is
unloads a virus to the whole
network and then on Monday we're going

Teddy fresh clan there's eight of us to

nobody's ever gonna forget about it
we're going it's gonna be adorable we're
gonna all wear matching outfits and
shirt we have to do the shirts yeah so
if you happen to be on Disney Land on
Monday and you see a big group of
hooligans walking around and red beanies
come say hi it'll be fun so there's a
couple things I won't talk about before
we bring Harley and end on that first
things first the h3 live show that we
had planned for the 26th yes what Brad
buried we pulled the effing plug on that
B and it was so I don't want to I don't
want to throw any blame around okay but
here's what happened we were I don't
know how to say this without a lot of
misunderstanding in the process of the
prices on the tickets right so and and
and somebody somebody put the tickets up
without finalizing the details with us
first of all we were misled about the
price like we were told there was going
to be $3 in services fees so the ticket
is 30 bucks I kind of wanted to do them
for 25 but then they threw it up for 30
without consulting so then I was like
okay fine so 33 was what I thought would
be the final price out the door but what
happened when ended up happening was
there were so many fees so much taxes
and it ended up going from 30 to 50
bucks so two people coming into our live
show would end up paying
a hundred dollars to come watch us do
the podcast that was a good podcast I
wasn't comfortable with that at all I
mean our last show at The Improv was
twenty two bucks and like I don't know
if there was like a couple bucks service
charge but it wasn't but that was it
it wasn't 50% of the ticket price and so
one the tickets went up without us
knowing and the price was cut a little
higher than I wanted and then two we
didn't realize that first all the fees
that came with it than what I after
people complain to us yeah okay what the
hell that was just three bucks I thought
it would cost thirty three bucks plus
tax and so then I saw that there was
these insane fees and I was just so
pissed off and I yelled at them and I
was like dude this this isn't right this
isn't the way it's supposed to be so
they go back to the venue and then the
venue magically reduces the the
convenience fee from 1050 down to like
three bucks and then I was like okay can
you refund everyone who already bought
tickets like well I don't know we're
dealing with the AXS and there and I'm
like dude and it just said and I was
just angry I was like why didn't you
reduce the price from three dollars out
the get-go like what what what the hell
they says well nobody asked us to I was
like okay the whole thing was just super
sour and and it just didn't feel right
anymore and we weren't sure if people
were going to get refunded who bought
before and after most of all we really
didn't that wasn't the price we wanted
for this kind of show it's made us
uncomfortable that people would pay so
much and and also a lot of people have
to travel so right you'd pay for
traveling food drinks and and a hundred
bucks for tickets it's like twenty bucks
for parking no penalty so we're just
like you know what this isn't right
let's just let's just pull the plug on
this so everybody who bought tickets is
getting a full refund including all the
convenience fees and everything and I
know on Twitter a couple of good were
like well I bought plane tickets and so
I did genuinely feel bad about that so
what I offered on Twitter and if
anybody's listening bought tickets in it
airplane
it emailed a net HTH reproductions calm
and we will help compensate you
personally on on that there is one funny
anecdote the guy on twitter is like man
i got by this i bought plane
tickets i was like alright well you know
will compensate you thinking that what
how much is a domestic flight like $200
he sends me the receipt two first-class
tickets 1600 bucks
i was like bro i don't even fly
first-class I can't I can't I can't pay
you $1600 bro both some life choices you
have to live with we haven't fully
looked into all the details yet because
we want to just get everything first all
the people that are to compensate and
look into the details and makes
decisions a bit we like when we opened
that one ready what Dan cannula yeah so
anyway if you if you got if you bought a
plane send your your proof of purchase
to Dan and well well that will help you
out how we can but hey that's crazy that
you fly here to see us you know
acknowledge how freaking crazy that is
thank you ma'am what else I mean I
wanted to talk there's a couple of
things I wanted to talk about here for
one this is kind of personal but I feel
like it's interesting alright I don't
know how to broach this but I feel like
I want to talk about it okay we've been
chopped okay we've been trying to get
pregnant we being me either's been
sticking her dick right my belly button
I know it does good when you say we it's
like well I'm trying to get a dealer
pregnant when we say we try but okay
whatever we're we've been trying to get
pregnant we don't really know how it
works
Neela's been I've been rubbing my dick
all over HeLa we're not really sure the
mechanics of how you Lisbon
we don't know how it works so we've been
trying but so far another things work
this is not what I agreed to talk about
okay so we've been trying and getting
you you think like by the population of
the world that getting pregnant would be
something easy was it like seven billion
mouth-breathers in this world it's taken
up all the oxygen you know and china
they have like laws they're like you can
only have one kid or we throw the second
in the river everyone's scared about
overpopulation i can't even get a have a
kid how did we get to this point in
history and evolution if it's this hard
to get a kid like we like you've been on
birth control for like two years and
recently in the past couple months
you've been doing like ovulation tests
timing it out and stuff wait what are
you saying I'm in off maybe that's the
problem
no we figured it out you went all
brokers or you doesn't go honk birth
control so we've been trying and trying
it's so and it's so disappointed because
you try it all month all month guys no I
don't know if I want to talk about this
we try all month and then it's it's just
it's disappointed because ela gets her
period and then you and then it's like
 you have to wait another month and
it again it starts to get really
stressful at this point when you're
actually start trying but but what's
frustrates me is like what is going on
with this planet where everyone's just
getting out kids
but apparently a lot of people have this
problem a lot of our friends yeah almost
everyone that I know had really hard
time can it happen right I don't know
we had another friend who just had a kid
like a year ago they said they were
trying like with tests like timing it
out and stuff for six months and I'm
like where are all these people coming
from when you're 18 if you just buy it's
just like they make it sound like you
just touched a guy and you're seriously
and sex education that's what it makes
it sound like sperm can last for 30 days
so even if you have sex when she's on
her period thus warped this the sperm
can hide in her vagina for 30 days and
get her pregnant when she ovulates it's
like seriously
so my point my lesson to you is don't
use protection god it was most likely
you'll be fine I'm just kidding
protection is honestly to keep your dick
from rotting off your body no and to
prevent unwanted pregnancy let's not
start some rumors now that were use a
condom I guarantee it's worth it so I
don't know that's just something that's
that's I'm just trying I'm trying to be
more honest right I'm trying to be more
gentle I'm trying to talk about what's
on my mind a little bit this is
something that we've been thinking a lot
about and doing you know for a while so
let's talk about it let's be real again
have a I'm trying to I'm trying
maybe I'm maybe yeah maybe we're doing
something wrong maybe it's supposed to
go somewhere else no okay I don't know
you know Einstein says that the
definition of insanity is trying
something over and over again and not
getting resolved gotta stick it
somewhere else yellow I don't mean like
the but I was just making a joke I just
making joke I just wanted people to know
that was an anal sex joke or anything
all right what else we got here you guys
heard about all this I was gonna make a
joke about how I got in trouble got in
trouble for the transphobic tweet and
that's why the show was canceled but I
didn't add a border I don't really want
to talk about that I think it's whatever
there's a couple of videos I want to
watch but maybe we can watch it with
Harley cuz he's here
mm-hm cuz I've got that Count de aquila
video and the st. Claire news clip that
I wanted to watch maybe I should bring
Harley him

welcome everybody to the h3 podcast live
thank you to our sponsors today stitch
fix min Squarespace and Bolin branch
today we have Bobbie Lee the hilarious
and infamous pants [ __ ] Bobbie Lee
the comedian and community and comedian
and shooter he was on MADtv
he has a podcast that he slams and he's
just saw all around funny cool dude but
today before we get into that he's gonna
be joining us later I was feeling like
it's time to try a new format on the
podcast here because we've had like a
ton of interviews in a row and while I
and I love interviewing and spending
time with guests I feel like kind of the
heart and soul of the podcast should be
me complaining and hila listening and I
thought there hasn't been enough of me
complaining Andy listening losing it
and so I'm losing it and so what we were
thinking is that the first 30 minutes to
45 minutes should be me Neela talking
about what's going on talking about
what's bothering me what's not going on
and what's going in all right or out at
the same time you know there's lots of
twists and turns there's no coffee
there's no water on the table now I'm a
straight up diva okay I'm a pate I'm a
diva but I'm also a patient in forgiving
man okay and I can only I can only
tolerate so many what did I do to
reserve to deserve this disrespect
there's no glass of water on the table
we've got I would like a glass of water
though we need 30 minutes for no respect
got like a full staff of people back
here we get a glass of water
what are you looking at shredder anyway
what was I saying
I don't hear water pouring it's on its
way so we thought it would be we should
we should have our own thing you know
it's a we should take the time to talk
and see what's going on because there's
all kinds of stuff I want to talk about
so let's just get let's just get right
thank you Dan oh that's not Dan that's
in you guys beards are a melding into
one identity so first of all so yeah
Bobbie Lee will be here in about 30
minutes looking forward to that our okay
so we had a live show last month at the
improv with post Malone and it was it
was a ton of fun it was so much fun it
was exhilarating so incredible yeah like
so there was 200 seats there and the
thing about the improv is like there's
no real green room or backstage so you
have to walk through the crowd to get
there and when we walked through
everyone was just like so freaking
supportive and high-energy
it was incredible you walk out it's like
embarrassing in a way right you know
what I mean yeah cuz it's like
everyone's like so how you want to you
and it's like me so our first show was a
total blast our next live show is this
month on the 26th at the Ace theater
downtown LA the tickets are on sale you
can spam it
can you guys spam it and we'll also put
it in the description of YouTube but
this one's a 1,700 seater at the ACE
theater I am terrified I'm terrified
1,700 seats and I thought I could barely
talk more than like normally I can
barely talk right more than normal I
think you're being hard on yourself no
but I did find it interesting that so
Austin was like he was telling us that
he was super nervous and he's played
shows way bigger than that but I guess
it's it's different cuz he just goes
many things and he does something that's
really comfortable and used to doing but
going up in front of an audience like
talking and [ __ ] as a whole it's a whole
different I guess skills yeah so he said
he was super nervous up there which I
thought was cute
we were all so nervous raw I was
purified before I have to even talk
about this no I don't think we did see
that's the problem with this show what's
the point of the podcast if I can't even
talk about like that whole experience so
I was so I was just [ __ ] myself
backstage as we were waiting and then
Austin came like two minutes before we
were it was late and we're waiting in
the stairwell and of course he's always
on time it's the coolest guy he comes
cruising up the stairs and we barely
have enough time to snap a photo but I'm
just like I don't know how to describe
that feeling it's just yeah it's it's
excitement and nervousness and all kinds
of nuts there's like no words exactly
yeah I don't know so I'm wondering but
the thing about The Improv is that it's
so intimate there that you can like see
everybody's face
like the first row we're pretty much
like they're sitting right but I think
at the ACE you're not going to
necessarily see everybody in there so in
a weird way I expect it to be less
stressful in that you don't feel like
you're entertaining like people are like
staring at you waiting for to be
entertained in a way you know yeah
you're like when is the joke coming
exactly you're just staring almost until
like a black void because the lights are
so bright you can't really see anything
so that's really exciting I'm super
pumped and what the plan is that we want
to do it every month
and I think what we want to do is that
at the 8th every month like a residency
so we'll do it at the our last show of
every month at the ACE and we'll put our
tickets on sale for the whole year
probably next month after we see how
this one goes if I don't tank if I don't
bomb completely what's the worst-case
scenario like what would be the worst
bomb what if I just walked out and broke
my leg that's what they say brick you're
like what
I just tripped and broke my leg that
won't be that bad code it's not your
fault it's almost like thank you
goodnight no refund that actually
happened I saw a conference at Blizzcon
they had this is the funny [ __ ] in can
you try to find that or someone back
there at Blizzcon they have a costume
competition and everyone comes out in
their costumes and someone literally
came out and broke their leg it had to
be carried off the stage and I know it
sounds tragic but it was hilarious
can you find it in meanwhile I wanted to
talk about our last video Ethan's closet
because coroner Ethan says yeah that's
how much I care about it it had everyone
so polarized it was it was a shitty
video I mean I knew that it was just a
goof right it's funny we actually had
people unsubscribing like a lot from
that video it doesn't really bother me I
just find it funny that like years of
posting content and then all of a sudden
they're like nope maybe they had it
maybe that was it you know what Ethan
I've had enough with your videos because
the was this is it goodbye forever
you couldn't find forever here's the
video by the way this is important this
is more important than whatever I'm
talking about oh yeah this is definitely
it good it to get you guys are not this
is this is this is what's gonna happen
to me I can't wait he like immediately
just Oh
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Applause]
get it Daniel you shouldn't laugh but I
yeah he pretty much he sprained his
ankle or really he's [ __ ] up
he won't even attempt to stand up he's
just like you know what I'm done someone
carry my heads up and that's what
happens it's a huge security guy scary
though bro you you have one good leg
just stand up and hop off God Christ
she's also super nervous it's the most
but you yeah okay but I mean you've got
adrenaline just cop hobble off crawl off
stage if you have to just get on just
crawl out you're in the trenches man
those shells fall out
[Laughter]
look at this all these guys come on
carriers as out look at this they
grabbed him by the this is too good
have you ever seen this batter sight in
your life he's grabbing his broken ankle
[Applause]
[Laughter]
there's this moment here of like a face
that you'll never forget that moment
here it is
Oh makeup doesn't help so that's the
worst case scenario very much
I can relate last night I fell oh yeah
in our stairs yeah we moved into a new
house Hertz it's got pretty steep stairs
it was when I was just standing there
and he was coming down the stairs
language shredder it's dangerous and
Healy just ate [ __ ] like she just
skipped the last stair here and it
looked weird cuz it looked almost like
she meant to do it but nothing hit hard
she tumbled she timbered right there
remember anyway so I can't really who
can relate okay you can so anyway the
last video was a real ship post and a
lot of people were upset some people
liked it some people didn't which is
fine I I tried to tell you guys I was
gonna post shitty videos did I not say
that and everyone remember when we were
like oh I've been depressed oh I've been
depressed it took a little while from
that moment yeah I should have followed
it up with this but you know I just felt
like posting a video I didn't care about
what it was it wasn't you know but
anyway this mean was really funny on the
sub right I love this this family man
the new HTC reach video was [ __ ] it's
the return of classic h3 it's forced and
full of half-baked jokes and builds up
to absolutely nothing
he is alerting people on the Facebook
privacy scam was maintaining a good
balance between information and shed
posting all he did was say Facebook and
AIDS 50 times can it be both I feel like
it can be both I feel like the truth is
somewhere in the middle I don't know
what is this from its it's from pawn or
these are the it's called a West Coast
Choppers are the West Coast boys I love
that just he's throwing it like a really
capture yeah the feeling of those coins
right like exactly exactly anyway guys
we just posted a new video that I'm I'm
happy with it I like it
we're trying to get back into the swing
of it
you know that's two videos the longer
you don't post it gets harder to get
back to it right so we're just trying to
break that that's what it was and
there's like a wall seal yeah and that's
what that video Ethan's corner was cuz
you just okay you make a video it's not
as good as you want maybe it's you don't
think it's good at all but at a certain
point you just got to post it and move
on you just because then what you don't
post it and then you get even more
depressed and then you try to make
another video game order I am at the
point where I just want to post it and
move on because I feel like I need to be
creative I need to be just moving
forward all the time because lately I've
been so depressed and so stuck and so
just like stuck in the same thoughts in
the same head in the same space and I
just I feel like I need to slam through
that yeah blast through all that and
like not working slash posting videos
they go together not doing that gets
more depressing you'd you lose like your
purpose what are we doing here alright
what and we've been putting too much
well stuff that we've been putting too
much emphasis on the podcast
it's just that it's become the only
thing yeah and and and maybe I was
almost just overcome compensating for
the fact we're making I don't know
but we need to find a balance because I
was thinking back like to a year-plus
ago when we were posting like two or
three videos a week and for me that was
it really it was really cool it was a
good time for me because I was always
creating something new I was being
creative and I was just expressing
myself more authentically than always
trying to I don't know whatever
I've been dude I've been I've got I I'm
gonna be real I have a bottle of
antidepressants and next to my bed and I
take it out and I stare at it and I
think last night I was like having a
breakdown this [ __ ] like there's this
Amazon [ __ ] like we had these guys
install tea
and there's such buffoons these guys are
such meatheads they install it so close
to the [ __ ] wall you can't plug
anything in now and now it's installed
on a mount so I've got this Amazon stick
so I want to watch YouTube or whatever
and I'm trying to plug it in and I can
feel the socket every I have to rip the
TV off the wall and jam my hand up back
there and I was like almost bleeding my
hand and I I could feel the socket and
it was just about to go and but it
wouldn't go in
okay and I was at this for like an hour
I was like OCD obsessed I was losing my
mind
I felt like I was aware of how insane I
was acting but I couldn't stop it was so
[ __ ] close to get in the hole and all
the time I know that I'm such a lunatic
but I can't stop trying to get and I was
like dude this I'm so [ __ ] twisted
evil is coming in because I'm screaming
like a lunatic and she's like she's like
what's wrong with you I'm like I don't
know she's like that's not normal is
like I know dude but I gotta get the
damn stick in the hole you know it's
like this little thing which I became
obsessed with it was just manic so I
just stopped eventually and but I've
been like she's been I just felt like
I'm being crazy lately I got this bottle
of antidepressants next to my bed I'm
like like it's I think it's time but
then I realized I never actually put in
the work and taking antidepressants is
like it's either the easy way out or you
already tried everything and so you
should take it because there's no reason
to suffer but I'm like this is the easy
escape because I there's a direct
correlation between me being fat and
lazy and not taking care of myself and
me being depressed and like I'm I'm on
an upward trajectory right now and I'm
like I can't take these if I'm not
exercising if I'm not eating right I'm
not treating myself well it's all
connected yeah there's a direct
correlation between all that [ __ ] so I
don't know I've been I've been that was
a couple days ago I've been exercising
I've been trying to eat better cuz I'm
not you know
you got to put in the work yourself to
fix yourself before you take well that
would be just a shortcut some people
need antidepressants but I don't know if
I do because I haven't actually tried to
help myself yet enough to warrant it so
I'm just like I got to do something
so I'm trying I'm trying this is all
part of the same thing I'm trying to
trying to exercise I'm trying to treat
myself better trying to just post videos
be more creative in that way man though
dude I'm gonna get that [ __ ] stick in
that hole I swear to God that stick is
going in that hole can we take off the
TV I tried dude I was like I was pulling
the string I was like it's a big TV too
and I was always yeah we can take it off
there's a easy way to do it
but it just seemed it was like it was so
sick it felt like a biblical like
metaphor because it was within reach and
it was totally doable you just slide
your hand up and it's just a little
awkward and it's like you know what I
mean it's like get in the hole I was
literally yelling and I'm just like it's
doable that was the hardest part but I
just couldn't get it in I know there's
meaning somewhere in there I don't know
where it is I know it's a yeah yeah well
join the club
what else some will lunatic went to
YouTube and try to kill everybody there
you know when that news broke that there
was a shooting at YouTube here's this
[ __ ] want to show you guys this but
let me talk about this a little bit when
I heard there was a shooting active
shooter there the first thought I had
was like please God don't let this be
some disgruntled loser youtuber I was
like please the world is not that we
haven't gone that low have we
and then at first they said it was a
girlfriend who shot her boyfriend or
whatever and I was like great I was like
okay thank God well weird that it
happened at YouTube yeah but then it was
no is just even started that rumor I
have no idea is that strange
yeah well and besides that I have I know
people who work there but I have one
really close friend some of them
actually care about who works there and
I was like I was so worried because
there was no anything yeah and you
didn't know how bad it was and I texted
him and he didn't he didn't answer me
right away so I was like I was concerned
and not only that but you care on the
level that you know it's a traumatic
event for them hmm and you know that
things aren't gonna be the same now at
YouTube and Twitter and Facebook and all
these people do like you know it's
almost like it's not the same anymore
because now the seals been broken and
all of a sudden someone who's angry at
how you treated I was gonna come try to
murder you but anyway this lunatic
she was just thought that YouTube was
suppressing her views but honestly her
videos just suck and they're weird which
is the case in most of the time I have
to say if your fellow youtuber listening
this and you think that there's a giant
conspiracy to to reduce your views that
could be right to an extent but for the
most part if you're not getting abused
it's probably because your videos suck
and your fans are tired of your [ __ ]
that's way more likely that's probably
75% of it at least and in her case it's
like yeah there's no conspiracy your
shits weird
I heard sometimes that happens it
doesn't even matter right that's not
even sure even if they did I guess I'm
just addressing her point that it's like
people are entitled to be like well
anyway it doesn't matter you're right
but my friend who works there was saying
like that
that uh she was she had a handgun and
luckily shouldn't have something more
dangerous or more deadly with more
rounds but he said there was like a busy
lunch area where everyone was eating and
she came up and just started shooting
people randomly but she was firing into
a glass door lunch so he was saying if
she actually was was trying to trying to
hit more people there could have been a
lot it could have been a lot worse
I don't know what's going on the weird
thing too is the police saw her found
her in her car up near YouTube studios
because her dad called the police and
was like my daughter or maybe her
brother family member my daughter or
family member is super angry at YouTube
and she's dangerous
really yeah he said they said I think
she's gonna do something and so the
police found her sleeping in her car and
they let her go
what because well the police said she
was fine she wasn't she didn't seem
dangerous but I don't know it's like
it's the same [ __ ] that happened with
this recent school shooting it's like
every every sign was like this kid is
dangerous he's deranged let's keep an
eye on him you know I'm glad that that
it wasn't worse don't say that
another thing that really was insane
about this whole thing was all the
comments everywhere
yeah everyone she said what happened
yeah like Oh YouTube deserved it that
was obvious I knew it was coming and I
was just like but I saw so many and then
upwards do ya cuz everybody's got to be
edgy little everyone's so edgy and no

tomorrow right
yeah that's really exciting thank you
I mean tomorrow's the 30th that comes
out on the 30th yeah that's really
exciting thank you for being here now
before we get too deep into our
conversation I know that your smoker did
I not say then was that a thing that
people only said like at the beginning
nobody really says deadmau5 they do they
soul do they do I don't care I think
it's just funny guy and then when I
started learning that nobody could
really get it right I started saying it
differently at different like events or
like that I'd say Jeff Maehl 5 deadmau5
I would I say hi this is deadmau5 and
then everyone would like Oh take that to
the bank you know
oh there was like 20 old pure chaos yeah
why did you choose the 5 instead of an S
we're kindred spirits in that regard we
have h3 or C on F net remember that I
yeah
IRC yeah yeah well chat yeah and then f
net you know you had f net down that or
whatever you know the different IRC
networks or stuff so I was on Afghan
mm-hmm and I used to be an hashtag
actionscript which was like flash coding
um for flash like back in the day and
it's early stuff so I used to hang out
there with like guys like Craig Keynes
and who later turned out to be like you
know the god of ASPR AFP flash morning
and stuff like big coder nerds and um so
I I don't I remember the context but I
changed my name too
deadmau5 MOU se but like you could only
have seven characters on that then so I
had to trim the last one then just put a
five that's just to save space kind of
thing so I wouldn't be thinking at the
time that you know when I start my
musical endeavors I'd be yeah do you
think that it's it's almost great in a
way though because it's more intriguing
it's more interesting right oh yeah and
I mean jay-z was taken otherwise you'd
be alright yeah
jay-z like in our case we were we wanted
to be he he which is our initials and he
sounds really stupid I'm glad all right
and although is that what it is yeah
because my name is Ethan Edward and elos
is Kela I was like h-cubed podcast that
would be cool I wish it was cubes H cute
what is it is cute we're cubed but
anyway so we did the threes and that's
much cooler than hehe mm-hmm so there
you go
Jesse's a mother of invention as I was
saying your smoker and and that's you
know I'm not here to try to like change
you or anything I just think that
there's there are people say more
organic
maybe healthier ways to smoke I don't
know I'll let you decide but we have a
we have a vape here I thought maybe you
could try it and maybe it's a good
alternative maybe you want to try vaping
yes a little pen
dan can you bring in the little pen
let's see if the Joel if we can convert
him into a vapor okay here we go
okay oh my god oh yeah you know it's a
little pen this is our entry-level babe
this if you like it we can get yourself
with something more serious if you want
to go grim yep so go ahead show them how
to use it then let it rip how much you
made I there's this let in a dive like
like all point yeah
there's a slight chance but it'll be
great
so here you yeah push that and then suck
yeah oh yeah that's a fat rip feel great
that's a fat rip it's it's just beep
there's no there's nothing there's
nothing
he's going in for the red no this is a
world record how did you enjoy that
that was interesting it's fun rippings
very clouds and that yeah do you know do
you know there's a competitive vaping
yes I mean I know it's entertaining yeah
well there's different there's different
competitions right like one is how far
you can blow the clouds yeah yeah and
then well they have tricks every trick
volumizing gear that wasn't that was
impressive all right all right enough
enough with the gags it's a flavor is
that I think it's neat unicorn jizz
that's the one that dances so tell me
about your new album it sounds really
interesting and very different than
stuff you've worked on yeah I mean I
haven't been passing an office hey this
is my album and this is a direction I'm
heading in and um [ __ ] all everything
you want because I'm just gonna do [ __ ]
like this from now on it's just more of
a side project really and just so
happened then there was like a large
enough volume of it to constitute
nothing right so all the better which
buys me some time to actually work you
know on another album coming out in the
spring which is going to be more akin to
you know what people usually hear from
me so but this one's cool because it's
actually a collection of like piano
concertos that I've written you know
over the years um and really never had
an outlet form like in terms of like you
know well we can't just like you know
take your weird
just piano only songs and put them on a
CD and sell them who do you think you
are like right Gary Glitter or whatever
all right [ __ ] name but it don't work
astray oh right its lowest rated in this
incident like we I submitted that music
- a friend of mine Gregory wherever it
who is a composer like he composes for
film in massive orchestras and stuff
like that I was like hey can we take
this and then throw 80 player string
sections on it and you have to like
adapt it in such a way that work
musically and all something's like yeah
easy
you know what's already you've given me
more information than I need to do that
so with your melody melodic structure
because it means like trying to take any
modern Indian track he's like the dumb
dog along with one note over and over
again okay let's make an orchestral
version of this okay cue the timpani guy
like you know four four and then maybe
the Contra bass playing the same note
over and over I think my music was
written like more melodic central first
so you know giving that material over to
Greg it was like easy-peasy to
transcribe it and we wrote it you wrote
the melody on piano and then you handed
it off yeah yeah and somewhere it
contracts as well like strobe and stuff
yeah that's so cool that's a really cool
project work so the whole album is
basically orchestrate all it's all
orchestra it's a symphony Wow no like ol
Cynthia which is crazy because you know
I'm reading up on you know I'm a dance
Mozart and all these guys I'm always
written his first symphony we use like
you know 16 and 12 and stuff like that
like well not that no I like the compare
myself that but I mean that would be
something cool to achieve in a lifetime
you know they'd get a body of work out
that's like you know in a traditional
sense an orchestra are you there when
they when they're all together
performing I'm playing the this is my
Ralph
so Joel goes in with people who have
spent tens of thousands of hours playing
and being you know violinists and and
then I walk in with my Moke I'm playing
the mode
so yes I managed to sneak my myself into
the orchestral mix during the
performance it like though being there
with all those people playing your music
um was it cool insane insane audio like
in terms of like the the way you hear it
because you would be surprised how far
off we are you know from the future of
being able to hear something as it's
happening versus how it's recorded into
a DAC and then output because think of
it like this even the most pristine
recording the Dave Brubeck recording of
take five like you know some of the most
legendary recordings playback on two
speakers which are two monophonic sound
sources meaning that there's only like
one speaker with one access one axis
that can move to produce a sound right
and then stereo is just two of them
doing that right but when you think
about it you're not gonna match the
fidelity of say imagine you know sixty
string players are 60 speakers you know
like that don't have phase problems or
correlation problems or all these like
you know kind of weird quasi scientific
terms that you could throw it like
acoustic properties coming for speakers
so sitting on the floor of an orchestra
playing you know your music sounds
insanely different than you know even
with the best mics and the best
recorders recording it and then playing
it back through the speakers it's like a
universal art is there a way for
consumers ever to get an experience like
that without just going to the or no you
absolutely you have to be sitting there
and being in the same room as that you
just shredding away down there so are
you gonna tour with the orchestra
I would love to um I think it'd be cool
like sigh pressures doing long you know
like I said I'd hate for the conception
to go around that like Joel says [ __ ]
dance music and now he's a hans
Zimmerman you know or you're not saying
that no for the record yeah um but I
mean but it's cool first of all it would
be awesome to do but the the to counter
note that the fiscal side of that is
insane Oh mad and a been enjoying
touring with the pillow with
five guys is expensive all right that's
five flights fly five meals five hotel
rooms every five of each times up by a
factor of 80 that's yeah they don't well
what will they do okay
consider a session player like or
someone who performs in an orchestra
whether it's this work show that artists
are they kind of stay where they're at
and they're like robots that's why they
have like the orchestra of this city
mm-hmm yeah absolutely because because
these people are so [ __ ] talented you
could literally put the music in front
of them they've never heard it before
and this is how it went down at the
recording session I'm a second you know
I'm asking the the composer and the
conductor I'm like so how long have you
been practicing
and they're like first right hardened
you know practice yeah I was like just
give me like one take they're like yeah
okay well I have faith and they put the
sheet music in front of them and they
read they're like human computers they
just read the sheet music and play it
exactly as it's notated you know notated
wrong then it's wrong but they didn't
play that [ __ ] wrong you know so I was
like wow that's really insane because I
thought um during the session recordings
that we did at east-west which was like
you know one of the world's best studios
for this kind of thing um I thought well
this is gonna be interesting cuz I've
had keyboardist and you know session
players coming to my studio or other
studios and then we're like okay bar one
a little oh okay well we'll punch you in
from parts 35 and okay boo oh [ __ ] okay
okay boo boo boo boo and I'm like
thinking okay well if we scale that up
two times you know 60 players never get
done it'll never get done
yeah so how does this [ __ ] get done and
then of course their first hand they're
perfect are they're like okay so we
finally get everyone in the room [ __ ]
conductors tap and everyone shut the
[ __ ] up phones off okay here we go
played the whole song flawlessly and
then I was like that's it and they're
like that sound good and I was like that
was like perfect then they were like
yeah well it's what was written on the
thing right thanks Gregory who did that
work I want to know one of you could
ever do something where you like travel
to like municipal orchestras and play
with them so you're
not the first idea that me that would be
so fun
that'd be cool yeah because it's like I
said it's not it's not a matter of
having to move these musicians know what
they're all know what they're doing in
their respective you know locations and
stuff like that like the world is so
interesting man it's really crazy and
and it's funny because my composer
friend is of that world and knows all
this he's done you know Deadpool the
Avengers and all this stuff like all
these big scores and stuff like that and
he's like you know there's just as much
[ __ ] in this as I know that you
haven't danced with like bow ties ins
you know what I mean like well not
really it's a little more laid-back than
that it's not like the white wigs and
those guys sitting around anymore but
besides this is like you know there's
just as much constraint in stylistic
approach that is kind of the norm or
mean stream
orchestral music which is like hard to
fathom if you're not a fan or someone
who's been following you know the latest
greatest symphonies because that's the
thing is everyone can name you know
popular albums at the last five years
right let's say you know Kanye's life a
pop no this and that that you know and
all these other records name name the
last symphony ever written yeah no I
know there's hundreds and thousands you
know which is namely you know it's a
world totally new territory for me so
it's really cool to be able to explore
that you work you were quoted somewhat
recently of saying that EDM is dead or
at least that it's dying
yeah but that was back in 2014 so I'm
wondering what else long yeah so I was
wondering what do you think about the
current state of you know well that's
the thing the current state is the state
it's been in the last five years see I
don't know I think I'm kind of like not
taken out of contact because I I clearly
I mean what I say even if it's like some
weird [ __ ] comment or something like
towards cuz honestly the biggest
question I always get on Twitter what do
you think about dot dot dot like what
the [ __ ] you know okay fine and then I
just say what I'm thinking at that
moment but um here's the thing is when I
started making electronic music it was
literally I started making electronic
music as a joke you know
just kind of a funny thing because it
was like kind of on this weird lull that
it was all starting to kind of sound the
same what what I had done is as I
implemented like at least from my end
you know I'm not saying I'm the only
innovator in you know modern-day man's
dance music there's lots but from my end
of it is I I came from this kind of like
industrial kind of mindset in terms of
music you know what I mean so it's like
I was my melodies were a little more
melancholic like Radiohead a la Nine
Inch Nails kind of thing and I thought
that you know house music which was
actually house music back in the day and
that kind of early stage of techno and
trance early trance like side trance
like we're talking like art of trance
and you know all the Platypus records
kind of trance all that stuff was like
really euphoric sounding in terms of
like you know major key changes like in
scale and stuff like that and it was
just everything was really positive
about it and I go how come no one's done
the the kind of the bummer the
diminished kind of feel you know dance
music just can create like more of an
emotional bummer lo right lo not lull
you know l ull in that kind of music and
I started to do that and then one good
way to achieve that was just you have
really lush sounds that were like you
know kind of long monotonous on like
eight note repeats kind of things and
then that was this track I did called
faxing Berlin kind of thing which was
not like this uplifting kind of MORTAL
KOMBAT yeah you know they write that's
what that's where it was heading him in
my eyes and then that caught on you know
and then then everyone else started kind
of doing it and all that stuff then we
propelled it to this place and then it
just evolved as music does you know it
never comes full circle so it's not
gonna go back to mmm so what you what
you mean it's just it's evolving yeah
it's moved beyond where what yeah it's
just moved beyond I mean it's dead I
mean just that piece of it is that I
know it's done to death that you know so
what do you think about where it is now
I mean what's going on now music as a
whole - like honestly I don't give a
[ __ ] um I haven't really thought about
it much like cuz I'm not if I were smart
and I wanted to make a lot of money I
would absolutely think about where it's
headed and what it's doing and what the
trends are because that's where you go
in you exploit those
there's plenty of Acts doing that right
now you know what I mean where they
gonna say woo this is this is the new
sound this new trap
yeah well I'm like speaking for two
years ago you know what I mean like guys
it's kinda what is trap how to do it is
like hip-hop without [ __ ] you know
rap always over it and other people
analyze these things like you would
running a business analyze trends and
pandered to those kind of trends I've
never really given a [ __ ] about it so
like I don't I don't see that and those
respective kind of things going anywhere
because it's not like of my main focus I
guess I mean they probably think about
just staying relevant whatever that
means
exactly exactly that one of my most
loathed Twitter comments is are you even
relevant right relevant to what finish
the sentence you know what I mean like
just relevant in general relevancy is
like the weirdest word I've ever heard
you know it when it's used in that
context of no context and I mean am i
relevant yeah my cat relies on me defeat
you are very super relevant you know
what I mean like I'm the most relevant
[ __ ] thing in that thing's universe
we don't be relevant finish your thought
finish your thought explain yourself
like I said I really have no qualms with
people making you know like haphazard
guesses as to my state of mind but
please have something to back it up I've
never I've make a point like I try my
best that when I say something even if
it's you know benign or really you know
kind of attacking someone or something
like that I've got like empirical
evidence that founded that statement you
know what I mean I don't just I wouldn't
say I hate you could you look like a guy
hating him drew thank you but I could
tell you a hundred stories about why hey
drew and then that would explain to you
why I don't even like you you that's
great but I do you like you you I
thought I was gonna walk into like a
drag fest I don't know why you expected
that you were expecting all kinds of
crazy [ __ ] hearing you talk about it
yeah man like I'm paranoid as [ __ ] just
sit here alright I don't know
no good I got a boyfriend I think is it
a youtuber thing a youtuber we have a we
have a rap we have a reputation I guess
or some sorts but the podcast is like a
different thing well yeah a youtuber
thing what's a youtuber thing like I
know what a youtuber is yeah yeah just I
welcome everybody today three podcast
live thank you to Dollar Shave Club quip
and hymns for sponsoring this episode
the a Street podcast god bless you
today's guest oh I forgot to open the
thing today's well today's guest is the
Lord of spice the greatest interviewer
over time generation well I don't know
if we can say all time I don't I would
not I would know get excited I could say
it mate it may be that you become that
the verb because you're young man you
have much more of your good work ahead
of you yeah but you're setting me up I
feel like okay greatest interviewer of
with chicken wings on YouTube not only
get all that out and YouTube complexes
hosts of hot ones the great and
wonderful Sean Evans thank you so much
for being here I appreciate you being
here
so much god bless you thank you for
having me it's an honor I have to say
one of the coolest things we've done in
our career is probably being on your
show that I remember that fateful
afternoon that was a beautiful thing
like in West Hollywood your show has
become this like is so legendary on new
media I think that it's one of the
highest honors I think a lot of people
come from traditional media there's
probably still some who don't know what
the show is
yeah of people who know what it is it's
like yes it has like it has a cult
quality to it for sure for sure
mmm well first of all as the king of
spice and the dude has eaten a Carolina
Reaper twice in multiple times who eats
the hottest sauce in the world on a
weekly sometimes daily basis it's true
eyes conquered the world of heat and a
half how's your butthole doing what hole
is holding up for everybody who's
concerned out there it is just it's
battle-tested it's military-grade it's
never been better you know I've really
it's like it's like somebody getting in
the gym you know what I mean I feel like
I've just built up a superhero butthole
at this time yeah what's your favorite
toilet paper Charmin you know triple-ply
if they had a six ply or 12 ply or 15
ply would be all that in a teamfight
weapon with the book yeah
exactly clogging that tie up every time
always looking for good toilet paper and
so far I haven't found that perfect
white well I feel like too cuz there's
such a range like I don't know what
animal would use some like single ply
public bathroom toilet paper when just
for like another 40 cents you can just
have that quality comfortable spirit I
feel like their only business is on
people who abide by accident-- right
right and I've been there and I'm like
oh wait there's enough stopped at the
corner store to pick up toilet or this
or just offices or hotel have you
noticed no matter how nice of a hotel
you stand it could be a five-star Four
Seasons I don't know oh great they
always have shitty toilet paper it's
like they decided that's the one place
we're all gonna cut the corner and - you
know what drives me insane is that they
always have like nine different types of
face lotion at some places and then they
never have toothpaste but like
toothpaste you can't get that on TSA and
I always have that problem where I'm
like I don't have toothpaste but why
isn't that standard like to paste
toothpaste should be at every how
everyone is going on it's like yeah I
got a riddle it seems like because when
you stay at these nice hotels they they
get like lotion from all these companies
try lotion you can buy some at the front
counter toothpaste hello
there's definitely a void in the
marketplace there we are already
there's a great Eddie Murphy I don't
remember I think was a Murphy he's like
I don't care how [ __ ] up your life is
how poor you are get the two-ply like
you know everybody can afford that to
apply for sure we're this luxury
everyone deserves well before we get
started we made a little tribute tribute
to you well an appreciation of your
spice and vulnerability your super
powers one may say I'm excited so here's
a little tribute so if anyone at home is
not familiar with Sean Evans if that's
possible shame on you
long pause but if you happen not to be
just a big fan like us please enjoy this
video as a tribute and I hope you enjoy
it I'm already into it
[Music]
[Music]
that's why you can do it I'm just a
normal guy there you go wow that's like
something that should play out of loop
at a modern art museum shout out Alex oh
definitely pulling his weight around
here I think there's a little attention
little you see there's a there's an
easter egg in the undershirt is that
what you're gonna point out no no what
the hell do you do I look at you don't
see that you don't see that at Eddie
fresh sure that's at Eddie fresh t-shirt
you see the little peeking out you are
ripping what I was gonna say that he he
you've seen this gag where they make a
wink but they like they just distort it
in Photoshop what he did is he found you
winking another video cropped it out
over your face pretty convincing it was
I fell for that
I was like did I wink but what that
really is meant to celebrate is you're
you're seeming Lea and vulnerability to
spice are you what's the deal do you not
show it are you just do you build a
tolerance to spice what's going on with
you I think that and maybe you could
probably help with this having been on
the receiving end is that when you're
doing the show I think that there's a
responsibility with the interview that
kind of turns you into a superhero you
know you have to like keep the show
moving and like the pace so even if you
are uncomfortable you can kind of get
outside of it the same way you know like
an athlete in a moment of being
exhausted might do something superhuman
or like a mother that sees their child
rolled under a Volkswagen might have
that like super strength to pick up the
car and get them out from being pinned
under the tire you know that makes a lot
of sense
so I think that that's part of it and
then too I think that there's a part of
it that is like I need to show a
strength
a show of strength to you the guest as
sort of a comforting thing you're the
you're the commander who leads the
charge I'm like a shaman yeah exactly so
there's like part of it where you know
if I'm freaking out then maybe you freak
out like if I go on at Bear Grylls a
show and he's like we need to scale this
waterfall and then he's like trying to
do it and freaking out and crying and
stuffed and I'm like I'm not going up
there with him
you know what I mean so like if I'm
freaking out you're not gonna keep going
and part of it you know it's interview
but part of it is like helping see you
through this journey you know that's a
great response that's really powerful I
can keep that going so does that imply
that somehow when the interview is done
that it hits you I think like at this
point now doing it like 110 times over
the last two years and changed there's
nothing that I don't expect you know
what I mean so I think that that helps
and then there was a time early on where
yeah it would like [ __ ] up my day and
maybe like [ __ ] up the day after but now
at this point like if I have a shoot at
like two I could hit the gym at like
5:30 or 6:00 like I am starting to adapt
to a point that like maybe is like
borderline concerning but at least my
life is keeping a better pace and you do
you do any kind of like regulating your
body is there any doctors involved so
going on well I'm almost afraid to check
it out cuz like they'll shut down my way
or something like that but you can't eat
any more spicy food and then it's like
bull now you know and everything better
off just not knowing yeah exactly like
I'd prefer to just not know the time
I'll question if you don't go to the
doctor you can't get can't exactly like
I think the ignorance is bliss and that
respect okay but then to is like I never
really do anything like people give me
like 10 million tips all the time but I
do just kind of ride it out and then at
this point I kind of enjoy it because
you know like as you know there's so
many like calls emails da-da-da-da-da
when you do this and like I can kind of
build in an excuse if I'm like doing hot
ones or like popping a pepper or like
doing one of these shoots where I'm like
no one talked to me for like three or
four hours you know and I'll just go
home I'll blast the AC I'll put on
basketball shorts I'll catch up on some
DVR I'll listen to music and like I've
actually come to appreciate that I can
like play that excuse
like everybody exactly respect exactly
how like they think they have to get you
that line but now there's a trap that
actually sounds great yeah yeah so tell
me about this know you guys so since I
was on the show yeah what was the
hottest one then I'm trying to put it
would that be Blair's Megadeth sauce
with that was the one yeah so so how
does that compare now are you guys still
using Blair's is that like number two or
did you just so from the rotation we
took that out and then we brought back
this new like I was Blair that well
maybe you know I'm probably at some
level but then Blair I feel like no
Blair I've I know Blair through people
like I've never met Blair it's like
loose on the bench man in New Jersey but
I also to think like you know he had
such a run there for a couple seasons
where you know he's like a jersey that
we hang in the rafters like he's retired
he's Hall of Fame like yeah he has like
a statue
outside a stadium you know like his
legacy will live forever um but then
with those sauce is what we did you know
like speaking of the consequences of it
you know like when you do something like
this on a long-term level we were like
looking into you know like the possible
side effects like from a health
perspective and it's like well if you
use natural ingredients then you know
like you actually end up like cutting
that down quite a bit
really so like that was our move like we
had to take the line up and move to you
know more natural sauces was just direct
based or yeah so like a lot of those
like super super hot ones they'll use an
extract or whatever and that's look like
really turns that up so our challenge
with this is like obviously we need to
make a super hot sauce you know like
that's the name of the show but then how
do you do it with natural ingredients so
what we did with this is we hooked up
with our boy and you know I'm like grew
reputation smokin ed curry yeah and we
put them on the phone and we're like
that was our challenge you know like how
do we do this
and what's funny about smoking ed curry
and then these just pepper growers in
general they're all like Architects are
trying to build the tallest building
they're all kind of retained this is
subculture farmers is nuts and smokin ed
curry might be the craziest one of them
all
so he grew the Caroline like better I
mean before he grew the Carolina Reaper
which for years and years was the
Guinness Book World Records have aureus
pepper right notorious pepper yeah and
then what happened is this farmer in
Wales grew a Dragon's Breath chili that
topped the Carolina Reaper but smoke and
IDI is always playing chatter to be
telling me and I'm not even sure if I'm
supposed to share it but [ __ ] it he has
this this this war chest full of peppers
you know he's got aces up his sleeves
that are all hotter than the Carolina
Reaper and he had it even when the
Carolina Reapers gonna be was feeling
bad he was a Larry top him so that he
could just dunk on him right back like
Kobe so the next point in that line was
pepper axe so we're like alright so if
we take pepper axe and then we you know
like we and here's the other thing that
we wanted to do because it's not hard to
make something super spicy you know and
we don't want just a sauce it's like
well you might as well just like teargas
yourself in the face for your eyebrow
yeah so like a culinary challenge isn't
balancing that flavor and then making
something that has a great flavor so
that was our goal that was our challenge
can you really enjoy the flavor of this
you tell me well I want to say at the
end of the show cuz I don't want to ruin
right you're right alright it's actually
chat right we wanted to try this and the
crew wanted to try it so we're all okay
pop the seal some day yes okay nobody's
tried it okay yeah I want to try it I
want to try this all of us are gonna try
to end the show as I'm saying thank yous
but like so tell me compared to Blair's
how much how far have we gone well I
think that like at some point you just
get into the clouds where it's like
you're just you know what I mean there's
not that much separation I think though
like on just biting into it if you have
like Blair's are de bomb which you guys
have bomb is the one I think was it
number eight yeah and a bomb and I
always see it with the guests is always
the one we're like like this one's
[ __ ] up and that's true be the one
that stands out my mind the worst one
right it is it is for sure and it's
because it like it has that just pure
extract and then like very few if any
redeeming quality right
only eating something that's super hot
it also doesn't taste good so it's just
a miserable experience all around so I
think that like having gone through that
or like whatever then this does seem
like a reprieve because at least it
doesn't taste like [ __ ] like
psychologically plus like once you're in
it and maybe you can tell me from like
being on that end and as somebody who's
gone through it a bunch of times I feel
like you know it's not necessarily like
an escalation in the saw like it's kind
of a bell curve like it is you end up
like eating and you're like oh this is
good and then you're like oh this is
getting spicy and then you're like oh I
want to die and then you have like a
couple wings left so it has that like
psychological thing but once you get to
that point like your mouths like so
burnt out you're so like into the show
like you've sunk it into that seat but
it's like fine you might as well get
pepper sprayed like you're not ready and
of course a conditional you're
definitely right once I hit the bomb
because you're like man how can it get
any worse than this but it actually he
doesn't really right yeah you mean then
number nine because I did the last
school too because you have such unique
experience do cuz you just enjoy so that
number nine killed me
mm-hmm but and then the ten was I wonder
if it's worse for you it's way worse
okay I was like the bomb is awful and
then I was somewhat like relief but you
just got yeah that's a very unique
experience
so guys stay tuned we're all gonna hit
you I'm not you have nothing to prove
I'm not gonna have to look it's just I'm
not gonna whatever you want but but I
was wondering what's the difference
the situation is like you know it's like
with Samuel Adams you might have like a
winner ale and then you might have an
Oktoberfest so yeah so we used the
Carolina Reaper yeah they're both pretty
[ __ ] up we put the Carolina Reaper in
one and then the last dab pepper axe and
the other but also because shout out to
the fans thank you to the fans pepper
axe you know coming from smoking head
curry it only grows on one farm and then
now we have this super international
demand he saw I was like so they like
our fans shout out to
drained Lake you know what I mean so
it's like we can't like ever like you
can't make enough as we grow it as we
make it it just disappears
so to like bridge that gap in the
growing season we're like here's the
last AB Carolina Reaper but that is the
you know what we want to do like to us
like making an episode as a creative
process but so is making a hot sauce you
know that I think I think that they're
you know I think that if you asked 10
people side by side we'll do it five
people at the end of that we're gonna do
it world do both all right cool you
don't have to I'm into it by the way the
pepper X is that gonna be the final name
so I think at first it was like we were
like her name to be determined and then
we were like pepper X and we're like
whatever but then now I feel like
everybody knows it yeah right so and I
like it it's like oh it is yeah yeah
it's a pepper X X I was gonna say that
so I had it as a placeholder but now
there'd be like massive confusion um
yeah maybe back in the day he called
pepper X but now that you're hitting the
scene I like the name thank you
it's it's nice old ship it's a yeah and
so but are you implying that this
psychopath who makes these has another
one up his sleeve beyond X and another
one oh my god one in another one and he
he's like eating them right and yeah
he's insane he'll like I've seen him
he'll just be like what are you doing
it'll just be like snacking on Reapers
no nuts
he's about about like he's about the
life genetically altered like how was he
breeding peppers I mean I guess that's
the science that I don't understand
maybe yeah so like I you know it seemed
to me like he'll explain it well like
talk it through but yeah he's like yeah
he's like doing these like crossbreed
like Frankie biology Airmen's
like he he has like a whole interesting
backstory if anybody wants to dive in
who goes I want like aerith's some of
his laundry but yeah he's been a a
Breaking Bad chemist of sorts this whole
life and that of now he's and now he's
channeling that into hot sauce crazy
well alright stay tuned to the end guys
I'm smoking I mean he's the best
so before you develop the show did you
have an affinity for hot foods
oh yeah it's like incidental I mean um
you know like when I was a little kid
you know if the Bears games of my dad
has chips out and salsa I remember being
like like a little kid six seven years
old like going to dip into the salsa my
dad has hot sauce and I'm like salsa but
he's like not in my house so my dad was
a salsa purist and he's like when did
the salsa you got to do real salsa so I
think like an - like by virtue of that
c-minus d-plus parenting like it did
kind of lay the groundwork what we have
today so I've always had that sort of
tolerance but as I say in the show
sometimes like I'm no superhero like I
go through it - you know I really do but
they're back they have soldiers through
what do they say courage is not being
fearless Sean Wow it's confronting your
fears bravely was there ever a point in
your career when you're like you know
what I'm I'm not doing a spicy anymore
I'm [ __ ] done I'm not touching
anything spicy I don't want to see
anything spicy I'm done well I mean
there's like part of you here's the way
I look at it hot ones I'm obsessed with
it and I you know this wouldn't have
happened if I wasn't you know and like
the team around and whatever and we'd
never would have been able to make this
flow cuz it is a super lean team on a
shoestring budget and the fact that and
you would know this you know doing a
thank you everybody for joining us at
the H Street podcast live today our
sponsors are MV MT movement my undies
and to which prime subscribers like you
I'm just pointing to the camera there's
nobody that I can see okay don't worry I
just like to watch you okay you like a
son that I never had as your husband and
wife nobody's people know that it's yes
okay good it's kind of our like you're
not just using that as a way to get
swingers and stuff I do
oh we're husband and wife oh yeah sorry
next week Sean Evans you know him yeah I
was about once - he's our mutual enemy
he is he's I thought he was just
fantastic yeah it was one of the most
fun things I've ever done because what
an odd way to do an interview it's real
it used to be this conversation right
well yeah and in today's world you got
to step it up talking's not enough
anymore well and there is a universality
and wings easy if you don't eat chicken
what's one thing but I I went as far as
I could go did you go the distance yeah
you did you were you drinking milk I was
chugging milk I had no I didn't feel bad
about the milk right I was hiccupping no
I know I only drink breastfed milk and
fry my own hey I like it when you're my
age you just man boobs just start
lactating milk just starts dribbling out
of there's two pour and some of us look
forward to leakage well Sean Evans is on
next week so if you want to leave
questions for him there on the subreddit
please do Bob Saget doesn't really need
an introduction but I'm gonna do it for
you anyway because that's the format of
the show television host actor comedian
Bob Saget I don't need an introduction
let me just say this you've got a new
special out on Amazon called
zero-to-sixty
yes it's not it's just cool I'm excited
about it and it's a great by the way
okay so now I'm gonna shut up keep going
it was
laughs a riot a gag a goof
it was meant to be entertaining and it
was meant to be kind of where I'm at
right now
right and I got the I'm on my way to
getting serious which doesn't mean I'm
not gonna be funny but like talking
about my mom passing away and stuff like
that it seems to be creeping more into
my reality of of just human existence
rather than talking about politics and
and I do like to talk about my penis but
yeah there oh well guys rest assured
there's plenty of penis jokes it's a
drinking game yes not not alcohol I'm
just saying that my penis it's a
drinking game that is that rude can we
say that on here well we were just
calling my literal wife my bottom [ __ ]
I don't write in I jump right into
defend her I was wrong you don't know
her I'm married to her no but I could
tell right away that she doesn't deserve
to be on the bottom she deserves okay
she's on a no space is good I don't
think it's a [ __ ] anymore man I'm just
saying I don't think we can we can't I
just think it's it is not the time it is
a time of all good men to to find out so
top [ __ ] that'd be a good show for like
Fox some you know top [ __ ] tonight on
top is right like a pimp and prostitute
reality show like you can hold it down
and keep the other hos and I keep the
other up you know hold it down and keep
it up that to me then you're not
offending everybody cuz the show itself
is offensive so it cancels itself out
you're not politically upsetting people
you're not gonna offend pimps and hoes
yes you are they get hurt that's pimps
and hoes be hitting and slapping man
right you're true that's true my special
was I love the title 0-60 which
commemorates you turning 60 years old
yes
how has your sense of comedy changed now
from back when you know you were mr.
aristocrats right now aristocrats
couldn't be done now
that is something that movie maybe it
would come out right now as an anti you
know freedom of speech fashion it was
just funny and weird and wild but today
and it will be like a statement and what
but that's what it was it was it with
the Penn Jillette and pop Avanza who
directed it made it took four years and
filmed 100 comedians telling the same
joke that I'd only heard twice in my
life and the point was a censorship
different ways the people can do an art
form you know all tell the same thing
everybody paint the same painting and
let's see what happens but it really was
about freedom of speech I mean Lenny
Bruce went to jail for saying things
that were said oh we in that film that's
interesting because it's gotten so much
worse since then oh yeah I couldn't even
well for people who don't know because a
lot of our audience are a little on the
younger side as they should be yes and
they are the future yes literally I mean
literally yeah we're out of here one way
it's not like we're gonna save the
planet it's like we're getting the hell
out of here and leading it to not just
blame what aristocrats to the people who
don't know what it is to Kratz was a
documentary made by Penn Jillette famed
entertainer as smart does magic but in a
revealing way Paul Provenza who I'd
known since I was 19 years old who was a
stand-up comedian is a stand-up comedian
and director and they worked for years
interviewing a hundred comedians and
George Carlin the great George Carlin
know any Millennials listening sorry I
didn't mean to label you or foster
objectify you well it is cuz I'm 60 but
I'm 61 really now cuz the special
happened and then I turned 61 so that's
weird but but I'm not saying Millennials
derogatorily basically I'm saying I'm
three times your age so I'm the one
eating it you know but it was really
about an old joke that was an inside
joke kinda but it really wasn't a joke
and now I won't tell it on here cuz
there's no purpose but the premise of
the joke was a family that's so
desperate to make it in show business
they go into an agent's office and he's
what do you do for a living and they say
what do we do and there's a million ways
to tell it it's like jazz you can go off
and tell it any way you want but the
family is somehow nude and committing
unspeakable acts and then at the very
end when they're all finished with all
these unspeakable acts and and
everything up to that point is jazz it's
how do you want to tell it how gross you
want to be Ruth some awful despicable or
what some people told it much cleaner
and it's a sweet little hey they did a
couple of somersaults and a few people
like Don Rickles and Chris Rock they
said I'm not telling this you know Jerry
Seinfeld I don't do that joke you know
they're right for them and I respect
that yeah and I miss Don Rickles you
guys got to look him up immediately I
wanted to talk to you about I'm here I'm
here and I don't want to leave so so at
the end of the bit they finish they go
tada and the agent says what do you call
yourselves and they go the foul whoever
you choose in the family goes the
aristocrats I think it was my version it
was someone's dying breath it was the
last thing but no I couldn't finish I
couldn't finish the punchline because I
was on stage at the Laugh Factory so I
literally as I was about to say the
aristocrats had to go onstage the joke
was and George Carlin who was one of the
greatest stand-ups there any you ever
have had as well-phrased said don't tell
this this is not for public consumption
this is for behind the alley this is for
how raw can you go and the point was to
make other comics laugh I guess or to
make just go three form absurd right and
it's a good way to play it's improv if
you take out the filth and there's a
million ways to do brilliant stuff that
people do I mean you watch a lot of the
television that's on now that we like
you know you watch it one of the good
improv ish type shows on Comedy Central
or you watch something where you
watching Will Ferrell movie where things
that is cooking and you know they're
making it up as you're watching it and
that's that's that you know but this was
a different animal so years was the end
the most infamous one everyone
cause like a man Gonzaga and his
aristocrats bit we can't even well when
I opened up you mean that when I open up
Newsweek and I realize there was never
an amage to full houses character right
but to this and it was the flip well how
do you feel about that I feel good I
mean I I do many different things I've
been on Broadway a bunch of times and
not the street have actually been in
place well and and n Street yeah and I
just I love acting I love directing I
love doing different stuff but you know
you get pegged to something and I played
Danny Tanner and damn and I'm gonna play
prop it's for the rest of my life
because it's not going anywhere so that
shows we're gonna go do more fuller
houses that house will remain full for
eternity it's it's not possible by the
way if you go and see the real house in
San Francisco which I did
it's about 2,500 square feet oh that's
small and that is full and it was bought
by the original executive producer
creator Jeff Franklin and I think it's
just to say hey you want to see uncle
Jesse's room you know but it's it's a
small house but when you walk into the
distal living room you know you're
looking at a 7,000 square foot house if
you're at the set so it's it's an Alice
in Wonderland and a world once you go
through the Tanner door so I do you know
that's just that's something I get to do
that I think is fun and then I've got
all those other stuff I'm doing but I
love I I'm sure you've had a ton of
stand-ups on here are you standing up no
no I'm uh you're on the fringe we don't
know you know it's like it's it's new
media right I'm a youtuber whatever that
means but we had like our first live
show last week and it did have I did
have a very performance-based feel to it
right working and watch these cameras
and it's a live show
we're live right now yeah and so I mean
I definitely want to consider myself a
stand-up comedian because I have a lot
of respect for what they do and I don't
do that I don't wreck jokes and I don't
prep and I don't have an act so well
then they do you similar to some
stand-up comedians I would say this is
where we're at is the next stage of
broadcasting is where we're at you know
there were there were three networks and
people would look into the camera and
oh my god that guy's a genius you know
oh boy Johnny Carson holy crap he said
that and it was a way of looking into
the camera communicating with one person
or communicating with thousands of
people right and and that's what you're
doing here you got millions of people
you got you have an earth that can
listen to you whereas other ievel didn't
so that's a responsibility by the way
yeah you can't be putting [ __ ] on the
bottom I mean this is it's it's a
misnomer it's very complicated are you
careful because there might be as you're
doing this there's so many people
watching this right oh you guys watching
you're all and I again bottom [ __ ] is
very complimentary it is it's a but yes
it's the okay saying it's like me saying
man that was sick man that was bad
you're Atlas you have the world on your
shoulders you're the bottom [ __ ] that
the world is oh why didn't you say that
I wouldn't amazing five minutes Adam oh
you just made it up I just conceptually
because there is also the implication
that she's being used so no Ian can you
do do some research on bottom [ __ ] back
there well this this is kind of big I
know there's an old song B bottom girls
but that they make the rock and world go
round but that ain't this do it they may
be what I'm suggesting to you and I
didn't get to get it out cuz we're never
gonna get to one question cuz I know
it's good which means yeah this is good
it's good you're a good host
you're both great hosts and I'm a
mediocre thank you but the truth of it
is someone right now is watching this
and they are the bottom [ __ ] now they
could be male or female or an animal and
they are the bottom of a pile of other
entities whether they be mammals or a
man or a woman
there could be nine people stacked like
a deck of cards right now and the one on
the very bottom is the bottom [ __ ] in
the negative vernacular right and there
they could be very upset by this or go
you know what I'm gonna crawl out from
the bottom and they're gonna get out of
that pile and that you would in that way
you've helped them this fired I'm
feeling so many
no I ain't going right don't cry you
hold those tears back but if you need to
cry you know I'm the damn bottom [ __ ]
for so long and I hear you see right now
it comes out it was not a high I sweat
Annapolis it's not at but it's your top
[ __ ] you see you want to work alright I
think we got to get rid of the words
[ __ ] yeah I don't think I think that's
the issue let's scratch the whole head
scratched bit and probably say you've
watched the latest Chappelle special he
talks about it and the way he talks
about it it's like the bottom [ __ ] is
the person who's like carrying
everything doing everything without them
you wouldn't be anything but you're also
using them yeah now then you explained
it and I should have see I didn't i
watched half of it I did not see that
part yet he's probably the best living
sander a median so great that exists but
I think she's proven her point what's
gonna turn into one what are you again
let's go back to my prostitute - that's
mine mine is a different kind of special
right cuz it's it's more I'm trying to
entertain people in kind of an
old-school way right with stories and
then I have comedy music yeah
which I've always done and that I was
gonna say before any of this happened it
would be a great edit to lift everything
out of no bottom bits in this whole
thing is that I feel a stronger need
more than ever to make people feel good
to entertain me because I know I'm back
to how you were different now
then you exactly that was your question
and when I started you know you want to
get on TV there's people that are
watching that want to be stars that want
to be famous and that ain't no reason to
get into showbiz YouTube that's really
become a thing and that's reality stars
and that that before YouTube you had
your reality star that was the the next
offspring of television and all it well
anybody wants us to be famous and and
and the point is you want you want to do
a good show right now you you know I I
want to be good on your show you know
I'm not doing this
somebody'll know who I am is this a
result
of maturity or something else I think
it's a lot of things but maturity is
part of it I think it's a lot of life
experience that's been but prioritize
things I have you know three daughters I
have a fiance who actually loves me yeah
and I know it was during your special
you were not engaged right because I
mean no I got engaged right a girlfriend
yeah we were gonna go back and and just
loop in a TR fiance boy I sure love my
fiance but I and so I have a huge
respect with with all my comedy which
tends to go r-rated and has if you go
through my old stuff man I mean I I'm
gonna like whoa there's pedophile jokes
in there and I sure I bet I'm if you do
it with the sound off it doesn't look
like I mean any harm
you know but it but it's offensive some
of it and there's still ways to do it in
Dave Chappelle in that special would
bring up and it's it's his style and
it's what a great stand-up comedian like
himself you throw something in you throw
in the grenade that's gonna upset people
but you finesse it he tells as you go in
and then you get out of it so there's a
smoothing that happens which is
basically called intelligent
communication it's smart conversation if
there's something you have an argument
with somebody and you need to get the
point out you you tee it up really well
you get your point out you listen to
them what you really have to do and then
we'll be right back therapy session but
but also my maturity cuz you know hey
man I'm 61 yeah
but I don't feel it and I don't I don't
act it and but I'm responsible I take
care of a lot of people I take care of
strangers I mean it if something
happened on a plane do you want me on
that plane I get mad I'm saying if
somebody just sit there while a
stewardess is gonna grab you from you
sit and injure you or recently did you
about the story of the puppy that was
stowed in the overhead I heard
so hair and and you know any injustice
but I was even talking more about I was
talking about more secure I am stupid
enough to think that I'm a hero you know
I have an adrenaline that kicks in if
something's wrong and they're feeling it
justice I want to test with fake Uzis
is not the time for that see the world
is so fragile but I if I see something
weird I will report it I will go and I
will get help you're a good citizen I
want to do citizen's arrest
I don't think that exists anymore well
then you could just arrest it sound more
like a vigil on me if I'm being honest
I'm just looking for anyone to a citizen
around I will tell you this I have three
kids you guys do not have kids yet right
do you want have kids we have a puppy
which is pretty much like our baby Musa
test there's a lot of people I think
where we have a lot of love for this
puppy and I think we're ready to get
more takes him out and wakes up in the
morning so I feel like that's kind of
that'sthat's the good relationship
you're being a good you're being a good
man you're being a great bottom and wait
for somebody and let me tell you I
cannot wait citizen's arrest my first
person it'd be pretty cool doing there
are no there's people sadly exposing
themselves that's a citizen's arrest but
I don't think you want to do it yourself
you want to call a cop I'll first show
it then arrest myself we have to be
that's it that's the end of my specials
that song we got to be kind to each
other that's what I that's the
difference in what I'm doing now I know
why I'm a stand-up for a lot of years I
went I want to direct I directed six
movies I just finished one which I'd
like to talk about at some point because
I'm a [ __ ] and I look plug everything I
can and that's what a [ __ ] does
everything she can that's how she made
he sorry he I don't want to be your
strength how many be a gigolo I mean I
am a gigolo yeah yeah opportunity yeah I
wonder if pimps have both men and female
or if they're female pimps whoo yeah as
a male prostitute I think
there's different I think there's
definitely male prostitutes and I
believe I know they are gotta be a great
female pimp so we're saying you're out
to get your own Private Idaho and goes
it was a male prostitute a [ __ ] and
anybody can be be a [ __ ] and a [ __ ]
can be a positive or negative a pair
yeah of course what I learned here my
[ __ ] Biggie Smalls one of my favorite
song Deerman for a girlfriend
whoo yeah anyway now let me ask you
that's accurate how how is Fame affected
you you've been famous for a long long
time right how has what's your
relationship with Fame been like over
the years from kind of when you first

today syphilis is serious I'm like Jesus
Christ what's going on in Hollywood like
I know it's serious but like what do I
am I not supposed to breathe here like

another one that somebody said there was
like gonorrhea we'll get you there's
like an epidemic in Hollywood of STDs so
make sure to they're free the checks are
free and the STDs are free food yeah s
fees are free depends on who we had a
long conversation here on the podcast
once about bugchasers were you there for
that I don't think they're yeah there's
people out there that they love catching
the bugs and specifically aids like
they're they'll go like take a dip well
they get it you I was talking about
there's like aids parties yeah yeah okay
yeah probably I mean I don't know who
else you'd be talking to about that they
go to these parties and there's one dude
with AIDS and everybody just [ __ ] each
other and then one other person leaves
with AIDS a gosh it's like aids relax
yeah AIDS relay arts like it sounds like
a bonus stage of a really awful game a
great [ __ ] deejays casino [ __ ]
slot machine
how you doing post how you been lately
I'm good you're about to start a big
tour right you're sure sure thing
did you told me you're getting this can
I do this yeah yeah yeah I'd smoke first
ask questions later you know I mean [ __ ]
Dave Chappelle does it yeah that's true
well I guess there's a technicality when
you're performing that like you can say
it's part of the performance you're like
okay it's an act it's an appetizer I
don't actually smoke I want to have a
cigarette but my mom is watching exactly
but if my jewel at home it's just an act
mom cardinal sin leaving your jewel you
told me that you're doing like selling
out 20k Cedars like when we when we
first hung out for the first time I
remember you
white are white Iverson had already gone
real big you hadn't even dropped your
first album yet that was about a year
ago that's it's insane how how far
you've come in that short years been
unbelievable yeah man I'm just trying to
kick some ass I mean 20k is and I'm
[ __ ] this is terrifying yeah yeah
we just need to Jamie people here this
is like 200 yeah hopefully it's not like
a Mobley it's not like a multiplying
with every 200 how many people are
watching on the stream at least 10
people chat oh you those people ten
people round of applause for if I'm
watching a home all 10 of you and my mom
I wonder air oh and shredder shredder
shout-out to my mom who's watching
shredder we were gonna bring him with us
but we're like oh my god we're going we
can't have a shredder at a restaurant
kind of wanted to set up like a little
cage here and just keep them in there
but we're like that's not that doesn't
make sense
that's insane we just figured that out
last night - more like yeah like don't
take him on any Delta flights or
whatever they - what the [ __ ] bro okay
let's talk about that thanks for
bringing that up so if you guys haven't
heard apparently us family had a puppy
little cute adorable dog that they
brought on a plane you're supposed to
put him under the seat in front of you
that's how you bring a puppy on a plane
and the stewardess was like you need to
put it on the overhead and insisted you
got put on the overhead I mean this was
a whole failure of on all sides because
they first of all they put it on the
overhead over a 3-hour flight they never
checked like hey is my puppy not [ __ ]
dying if it came down to me putting my
dog in the overhead compartment I would
definitely after takeoff get him hey
yeah well anyway spoiler alert the dog
died hahaha
really light no just start it off with
which especially broke my heart cuz
we're just so in love with our puppy
shredder and just I had a dream last
night where shredder got run over by
cars lighten it up a little bit more you
save them you save them in the dream
yeah it's less traumatic if I say that
though anyway how do you not check it
how do is has a story you put a puppy in
it overhead I don't know this world is
so puppy Shanor does not care but maybe
I don't know she being villainized
probably probably her names out there
they don't
[ __ ] anymore under like this lady who
lives at this address is it on her or
the stewardess or the owner well how do
you I mean I want I'd like to place the
blame all around cuz how the hell do you
put it how do you put your puppy and an
overhead for three hours yeah I want to
ask you something okay
I noticed you when I met you you were
rocking like you had like insane jewelry
I remember you had like a Rolex that was
like a bling the [ __ ] out with diamonds
and I feel like you don't really wear
jewelry anymore not tactical I'm going
for tactical nowadays
what do you mean tacticool tech okay
yeah I don't know I'm still [ __ ] with

shkreli story Friends of the show by the
way
farmer bro let me light one up for him
Bartz Corelli you guys know that that's
the guy who hiked up the prices on like
a life-saving aid road 5,000% Pharma bro
what's so crazy like a couple months ago
he called he was live streaming at the
same time we were having a podcast and
he called in right after his sentencing
came in and he was like here well here
you can pull it up he called into you
you ain't called into the shard how are
you just a little refresher how are you
feeling really 0 to 6 months and no fine
is it is that zero to C so the dude
interestingly he didn't get in trouble
for raising the price of the drug he got
in trouble for defrauding investors and
a hedge fund he gave him a cute little
fat it was a tiny little bit misleading
fact the hedge fund was supposed to be
worth a hundred million but it was
actually worth minus thirty three cents
that's not a joke just so it's a white
lie yes so uh recently oh wait pull up
this clip this is a great one this is a
wonderful setup for where we're going
here oh wait so oh yeah he went so he
was out on bond he's like hey I'm only
I'm only gonna have to pay I'm not
containing money and I'm just on like
house arrest for like three months so
the genius tweets this out the Clinton
Foundation is willing to kill to protect
its secrets so she's on her book tour
try to grab a hair from her I must
confirm the sequence I have will pay
five thousand dollars per hair obtained
from Hillary Clinton and payment after
this sequence matches good
patrollers so that so I mean he's
kidding but the judge was like dude
you're a menace to society because
there's [ __ ] Looney Tunes out there
they're gonna go try to get her hair and
cash in on that so they're like you're
going to jail buddy I'm revoking your
bond so they sent his ass to prison and
he's been awaiting his I guess like
further sentencing and got away for a
million that's pretty good for someone
release no debe you had to go to jail
how much time would you do is this
related to your situation
thirty thousand dollars and I Flickr

prosecutors cuz that was the last
interview he did before he went back to
prison right and they're like look at
this guy's beg he's bragging about it he
has no remorse he knows what he did he

this was a huge [ __ ] man this rock the
whole [ __ ] planet I hops putting up
signs all around the saying will not
welcome everybody today shri podcasts
live today we are here with a very
special guest we have got no sponsors no
[ __ ] going on we have got Chris and
Dylan here you guys may have heard of
these guys because they've been making a
splash on the scene lately
getting out a lot seen you guys all over
the place one list one life can you guys
fill me in a little bit of the backstory
of who you guys are and what's going on
sure yeah so Dylan and I have been
friends since fourth grade I just beyond
that we were never really like the super
fantastic close friends in fourth grade
you know just friends in the elementary
school and then in fifth grade I got hit
with the diagnosis of chronic myeloid
leukemia and Dylan was literally in the
hospital with me every single day it was
a obviously as a young kid it was a
crazy battle but having someone there we
played video games like every day on the
PlayStation 2 that's literally all I did
you know take my mind off of stuff and
it was it was a big deal to go
throughout the time as a kid but you
know luckily I got through it modern
medicine and all that and I've just been
taking these what's called experimental
chemo it's called like Gleevec spry cell
clue cig and I've been taking that for a
few years now and recently unfortunately
in October of 2017 I was doing just a
normal routine blood check and I got a
call when I was at my college letting me
know that they found something that is
really not good and that I would need to
go back for more tests and about three
days of back and forth of them telling
me oh it's a good mutation oh it's a bad
mutation then finally they were like
this is a terrible mutation this is
really oh my maybe bad never seen this
mutation before this is a first so they
weren't sure for the first few days like
they're like this could be good like it
is stronger now and it won't you know
attack the body or whatever or like it
is and it's just resilient to medication
so once I was given that news it really
hit me pretty hard obviously how long
ago was that that was just in October of
last year so it's just been a few months
so five months into my year you're left
pretty much to enjoy life I've been
doing a crazy crazy job of it thanks to
Dylan when I was when I first got told
he was the first person I called even
before my mom and he cuz he was in the
hospital my parents have work and you
know they had to do stuff but still I
mean it was he was a really big part of
it and he told me write down 50 items
that were gonna do like no playing
around this isn't just you know being
trying to be a nice guy like he's like
write down 50 items and we're doing them
and it just it started from there just
small things like you know just what it
is on normal people's I would say bucket
lists like go to space and stuff like
that and then I was just like crazy
stuff like meeting you guys and it's
just like this should never happen just
like all right Ian - h3h like stuff like
that and because like you guys are the
people who when I'm going through
terrible stuff like I can just put on a
video and forget that I'm dying of
cancer content can make wit like can
make me whatever the bad stuff I'm going
through chemo problems whatever I can
just put some memes on and you know just
watch it and it's it's it takes me away
from the crappy situation of like
stomach pains whatever it is it's just
like alright I get to focus on something
funny and so thanks like having you guys
on the bucket list is really like
instead of I would say normal
celebrities you guys are like my my
celebrities so it's really cool to
actually get to be as what we do cuz
we're kind of separated we don't really
interact with our audience that much so
like hearing that it's crazy it's so
crazy man
I mean I'm honored said that that we got
the opportunity to sit down with you
thank you no I want people to know that
they're well there's still a chance for
you to recover from yes of course it is
bone-marrow donations right now the only
thing that can save me is a bone marrow
donation and most people just say oh
can't your parents do it or can't a
sibling unfortunately I had a sibling
she committed suicide in 2014 and she
was only a
about a six match and they can go all
the way up to a ten out of ten so my own
sister she wasn't enough no yeah well my
mom is only a three out of six and yeah
most it's pretty much a numbers game the
more people that sign up to be a
registered donor what are the chances do
you know it's only 30% that you're gonna
find a family member it is a match so I
know that's probably not the exact
numbers you were looking for but that's
because it just depends on races it's
purely general so African Americans and
oriental people they have a lot harder
time because you know there's North
Korea South Korea Japan all those things
are genetically so racial purity yeah
yeah I was when they take out my bone
marrow and they say that oh okay he's
Portuguese Puerto Rican and blah blah
blah that's a tough one so yeah and it's
it's a hard thing and it even goes as
far as like I remember you got some
weird virus oh yeah and it's viruses too
like they have to have every single
virus like it's your bone marrow has to
accept someone else's that is gonna be
making good white glow the white blood
cells don't match it's literally gonna
be civil so here's what I want to do
today I've been following you guys story
there's somebody out there with the bone
marrow to save your life
even if you don't match him you can save
somebody else's life yeah and the
process I thought it was super scary and
crazy but having followed you guys story
it's it's very simple it's like a and
what do you call it outpatient it just
takes like an hour you show up they pop
a needle in your hip you go that's if
you're actually mad process you get on
the list is to get on the registry you
just swab your mouth and it's a free you
go online yep I'm gonna talk about that
later I'm gonna tell you guys how to do
that later in the show
but I want to say if anybody at home is
watching now one it said advise you guys
a little bit in case of saving a life
for basically nothing wasn't enough
incentive if anybody matches you and
donates I'm gonna give him $5,000 so if
anybody's out there who wants to help
this dude out you can save his life and
I'm gonna pay you $5,000 thank you and
I'm gonna give you a hill this is a
priceless offer my
it's gonna be weird when some like
Chinese dude matches with you and then
we have to send them to Ethan you the
hand ease option I'll send you the check
so I'm gonna tell you guys Walt here let
me bring Dan throw it up on the screen
we'll talk more about it later
before we get today we'll talk more
about it later but there is a lot of
misconception about the process and I
was under the wrong impression as well I
thought you have to like immediately do
the donation but that's completely yeah
yeah it's basically two steps you sign
up to the registry and then if you match
with someone then you're saving life
yeah that part's a little harder but you
know you're saving in life I've done
bone marrow biopsies before I'd say 2015
they used to have to take to check on my
cancer levels like in depth they used to
have to take a bone marrow say would
sedate me do all the whole process and
it was literally a pain and but now
luckily they have just a genetics test
which they just take like seven files of
blood and then they'll figure it out
that way but yeah I had to do literally
have probably done six not eight of them
one of the of the old school which is
just they sedate you and that's what
they would do if you are a match and
it's just what you sedate you you're
just on your belly and they get bone
marrow from your hip it literally just
feels like you got like charley horse
trot above the butt cheek for you've
done it eight times yeah yeah ever since
2009 ever they had me do it
every there are three times every year
and then down to two times every year
and that was the most I got him space
now six months so you can basically just
go in for a day we'll explain it more
but I'm not the only one that's on your
list there was someone else on your list
that happens to be here now so we're
gonna bring him in yeah you're the who
yeah oh no no it's Philip DeFranco
Billy Dee I noticed that Billy was on
your list here sit here oh that's so
that's the ghost of a live this is the
was on your list and we and Philip
wanted to come and meet you guys already
anyway thank you so what happened so
fortunately that we got I just sent an
email to your producer like an hour ago
yeah yeah well we were we were talking
about uh I was like hey I know these
guys are reaching out let's let's set
something up and and she said yeah we're
doing it and Ethan hit me up and I was
like yeah let's completely just just
kind of hit him from the side I thought
you were gonna make a joke about like so
anyway obviously thank you I just wanted
to continue the conversation we're
having you so this you dropped out of
college when you found out that you have
cancer that the story of you guys's
friendship really it's really touching
about everything you guys have been
through I mean how was it deciding that
you were gonna drop out of college and
how did your family feel about yeah
actually I'll start with how my family
feels I am losing my job and getting
kicked out in about two weeks yeah I
don't know if my mom is actually gonna
enforce that I think it's more like
kicking you out my parents I think it's
a threat right it's like go back to
college or we're gonna kick you out I'm
curious to see if it actually happens
but hey I like the very soft language
I'm curious what happens and it happens
you know it's like it's not ideal but he
won't be on that's the fastest way to
test out a friendship
sleep sleep next to each other
actually we we almost got we had a share
of bed almost tonight car Hotel kind of
messed up we fixed it so we just hang
out way too much it was literally used
to be like I would hang it out of his
house for like Monday through Friday and
then he would go to hang out at my house
for like it would just be weeks just
trading off just at each others house so
we're pretty used to each other's
shenanigans - so your parents don't
really understand what you're doing or
well you guys are well I my parents they
kind of went through the whole process
of like living from a car and then you
know my mom went to college now she's a
nurse and so she sees the opportunity of
getting that degree right and obviously
she understands that I've been friends
with Chris for a long time and that she
understands that he's dying but it's
it's scary for it's hard to say even
with all those facts it's really a tough
choice to make yeah
and actually she just paid for more
classes so I'm technically supposed to
start class like next week but I told
her I'm not going to do that because
yeah I mean it basically just came down
to you know if he does pass that I can't
sit in a lecture hall listening to the
Linguistics of Norway or whatever I was
doing well I know that he's sitting in
the hospital you know and at this point
because that commitment we made together
like on March 1st we broke a world
record and together the two of us we
have we are the people that have made
the most amount of people sign up for a
bone marrow registry in one day and it's
like if I didn't make that decision you
know then our effort would have been
posting on Facebook you sign up as a
marrow donor and then if he died you
know it almost would have been like not
necessarily my fault but I wouldn't have
put in my effort and now we're feeling
like okay we may be really I mean like
it's it's just up to someone else which
is the unfortunate part about this
leukemia is it's not like I can just
walk into a hospital just be like carry
me please I'll take one care like now
it's like finally good so I have to wait
for someone so really like we've tried
all we can right now and just hopefully
keep raising the awareness message
because it's not just me there's
hundreds if not thousands yeah so I mean
there's like the perspective of you know
not wanting to lose him right in
and just kind of letting that happen but
also we've had to buy a lot of hard
drives recently because there's so much
footage of experiencing life together
you know for terrible and and then it's
just become luckily we may I made that
decision you know we made the decision
because now we're inspiring people we
people are watching this entire story
and and we have people who care about us
and we care about them and you know at
first yeah it was definitely just I
don't want to sit here knowing that he's
dying but then it very quickly turned
into holy crap like we're doing
something that is actually changing
people's lives
well I think there's plenty of people
watching who'd be like yeah I would
totally put my life on hold just try to
save my friend's life like everybody
likes to stay dream and fantasize about
doing that but actually I think it is a
whole different thing so right because
even what you're saying I mean there
there are real stakes and the fact that
you're you're willing to do that to to
get the experiences that you're getting
now like that's I wouldn't I'm very not
about the romantic yeah I love that yeah
managerial economics cognitive science
and tech management that's what my
parents don't like is the fact that mom
I'm making a youtube video but you know
like we we say now that we're running
out of adjectives to describe what's
happening because like scrolling through
my contacts list I have Danny DeVito
right next to Brody Burns you got Danny
DeVito on speed dial
yeah I'm just wait we're gonna get like
a really populated discord server one
day and were just gonna leak it
just leaked his phone numbers I know
it's a that's the real game plan did you
guys expect to get this kind of
attention like I'm curious how did you
guys start and when was your first like
breakthrough because now it seems like a
lot of people know who you are but in
the beginning how did you first get
realized I I told Chris because a lot of
it was documenting the story right we
wanted people to see that like hey you
know sure and we're in a situation where
he might be dying but really you can go
live out a bucket list and and even our
bucket list kind of portrays that too
you know sure not a lot of people will
be able to sit in this room but we also
want to help an old lady across the
street you might want to feed homeless
and yeah personable as well is I want to
be famous how are you happy like it's
just there's there's so much stuff to do
in life that is beyond just Oh fun
things here fun things there it's what
will make you feel good about helping
someone else like genuinely helping them
not just like alright here's some 10
cents you know like to a homeless guy
like actually genuinely going out there
and making a contact and doing the the
first date cuz we decided to document it
the first day I had the camera in front
of Chris the little camera that I had
from high school
Chris you need to tell a story
effectively because 10,000 people are
gonna watch this okay
first of all if we ran out of batteries
because it took him so long pronouncing
[ __ ] to get one line out oh my god he
was terrible I'm bad I'm like even
originally in front of the camera it was
just like an intro sappy one like we
were talking we made we download we
maybe pirated an Adobe program and we
just like Adobe software in this house
it was crack trying to come up with a
flyer to describe what we are doing and
we were like mapping out okay we're
gonna walk to our neighbors and say this
and maybe we can get some money to be
able went on doing door-to-door to raise
the awareness
yeah we posted it on Reddit and next
thing you know he called me I think it
was with my girlfriend he's like hey
we're at a quarter million views yeah
just walking at the river in the last
time I checked it like three hours
before it was that like 60,000 and I was
are sweating bullets I was just like I
need to walk I need to like and I check
it again like once I stopped walking I'm
like oh that's like our video yeah and
really everything that's happened so far
is because of that first video pretty
much yeah
uncredible reddit sometimes it's great
sometimes it's the worst
yeah it's coin toss it's a it's a real
coin that sometimes I feel about backers
I think we own the rights to the music I
don't think I mean it was terrible but
its production to us you know it's a
story of who we are and and people
definitely didn't like it there are some
people who are very critical of it but
what did they say I'm curiosity it's the
whole spectrum um there are some
conspiracies that I'm stealing all the
money from Chris yeah that I'm actually
like I'm just some puppet just juice and
all the funds out of me he's just in
there just I love how cynical people
gonna be that they can be like even like
why wouldn't I just stop hey like that's
my biggest thing like eight point eight
why wouldn't I just say I'm trouble
because we had a patreon link in the
description and they're like oh you're
just trying because I mean I understand
it but I really have to carry around my
doctor's note that literally says like
and needs to go to the hospital because
he's gonna die soon I have to carry that
on me because people like no you don't
like you want to see yeah yeah I pull
out the paper and I'm just like read it
like that's my name right there like
it's it's real that's it that's the dark
side of the internet people are always
ready to see the worst possible scenario
yeah even the worst possible scenario is
like like just let it go dude if that's
what you think just [ __ ] move on like
don't make it your life's mission to
like [ __ ] on you guys
was the most recent one it was hardcore
so like he dated my sister oh well you
invited I did like back in the day and
like this before that person commented
they were just like oh I know this may
be weird but I for some reason think
that you dating his sister was the
reason that she killed herself and that
you're just in it for the money and like
I was literally just like damn like this
part that was the one comment and it
didn't like personally offend us but
it's just so like yeah it's just a lot
of those levels of like really like
you're gonna hey you're gonna bring up
my dead sister come over like all that
stuff and it's just like because I'm fat
and dumb don't target Dylan because he
dated my sister just weird you guys
actually are are you still posting
videos to our videos no we're trying we
do of our own content well part of it
too was I because we kind of share an
account and and I had some other
accounts and then also people were
pretending to be us saying me and my
best friend are doing this I don't know
what they gain from that so it was there
was some kind of we did take advantage
of the platform because when you post
something there and then suddenly you're
welcome everybody to the h3 podcast live
today's episode is sponsored by stitch
Fixman hellofresh & Seek next Wednesday
is our first live show and by live I
mean SuperDuper live it's a live
broadcast from a live show super excited
we are gonna be joined by your boy post
Malone during the word live so I'm super
excited thank you very much if you have
questions for post Malone leave them on
the subreddit there's a thread there
there's also a thread there for Bob
Saget which we're having on a week from
today so if you have questions for post
more on Wednesday or Bob Saget on Friday
please leave them on the subreddit and
but enough about what to be let's talk
about our to come let's talk about what
be now because today's guest is the
extremely talented a researcher video
producer director filmmaker and
all-around great dude and good friend of
ours the illustrious and wonderful
vsauce3 also known as Jake Roper thank
you thank you that was a very nice
introduction let's stop around
all the time tell me about the model 3
you guys everybody who watch the show
knows that I'm like a huge Elon fanboy
there's only been like 2000 model threes
made and somehow you got in early enough
yeah got that thing like right away do
you know how early in the line you were
I don't know I'm not sure I mean I
waited in line did you guys physically
wait in line for the model 3 yeah I
don't even have a reservation
Wow and that's thanks for watching I was
their day of stood in line
what I thought you did it online they
made you ask to actually stay in line
well if you wanted higher priority than
you my interest which was exciting
because you've seen like Apple launches
and things like that the lineup forever
this is for like a car and no one's ever
driven and people were lining up so tell
me about that experience of being there
in line it was really neat how long was
the line it wasn't too long I think it
was probably in line for maybe an hour
an hour and a half but everyone's just
so excited and they had a bunch of tests
loaners came in with like their model
X's Model S's and we're showing them off
to pee
online it was really nice it sounds fun
yeah there's camaraderie between Tesla
boys oh sure I wave
I do the table wave no one ever waves
back sometimes that's story my wife yeah
there's camaraderie between me and
everyone I don't know about if it's
reciprocal yeah so the model 3 yeah good
thing after this we can go sit in it if
you want bro I need to but I love it so
I had a Model S yeah I was very
fortunate I had a Model S I sold that
once I got the model three because the
model 3 was less expensive a little bit
smaller yeah and it just feels like the
future whereas when I first got in the
Model S it's like oh this the future nay
not anymore the model 3 is fantastic
well what's what's not future
what's more future about the model 3 I
mean it's little things like the display
is incredibly fast the whole system is
immediate it's like you can just swipe
around like oh it feels more future than
s feel slow right yeah and the
minimalist design I really love like
minimalist modern design so it's just so
clean beautiful there's still things
that need to be fixed but in my mind the
only things that need to be fixed
our software not really hardware
definitely and I love it I like the fact
that it has more range than what my
previous car did and and it's it's not
significantly smaller but it feels
smaller it's not like a book that I'm
driving down the road right so I'm a big
fan I would highly recommend it I saw
model 3 on the road for the first time I
slowed down I was like man you know um
yeah the Model S is really like a boat
like Ice Cube
I can't even park it because like I
don't know where it starts or begins and
I'm always it's super wide yeah I when
my lease is up I definitely want to get
the three and she put in your
reservation do y it cuz if I still have
the car for another two years
oh then maybe don't put in your
reservation like I'm hoping that I'll be
able to get one by then you will I mean
the well I'm not gonna say you will I
don't know one who knows Elon time is on
a totally different plane of existence
than human being time right so who knows
they were supposed to be making like
five thousand cars every week by this
point yeah not yeah but I would just I
mean here's the thing that's cool about
it I feel like I'm just a spokesman for
Tesla Tesla if you're watching please
just give me a car yeah for free yeah
that'd be nice and everyone here you
Ethan shredder no don't be so right and
your hypothetical but it's a diamond oh
yes
so it's a thousand-dollar reservation
right and then you can get it back if
you decide you don't want the car so I
don't really see what the downside I
think the Malta Theory's a little too
flashy for me too I like that really you
think it's flashier than the other s did
I mean say I meant strike that I meant s
oh that is a little too flashy it is it
makes me feel like I should be more
important than I am it's just like I
feel like a phony when I Drive one of
those cars was just like it's like it
really shows what its gonna because it's
like the normal or it's a normal car
more affordable and it's got all the
cool features like and this would be
reached to really surprised me about it
even though the ones that you can only
get her like the most high-end model
right they started 35,000 the ones you
can get now are basically 50,000 55,000
which is still relatively inexpensive
compared to other cars in its league but
it's still not as cheap as just a normal
car but it's like going in there yeah
but even for a $35,000 car the
differences between the one that I have
in the one that will be the mass-market
version is not that great and just
seemed like wow this is a lot of car for
that much money and the fact that you
charge it like a phone blows my mind
yeah it's amazing
how's the acceleration it's pretty good
no it's not enough it's good enough I
mean my face isn't gonna melt off but
that's okay I come you don't need that
okay yeah this is okay but it's also a
thousand pounds lighter I believe than
the s so it feels really quick a little
more responsive yeah and the turns feel
really tight sometimes I'm trying to
make like a u-turn on the S and I'm like
any other car mm-hm and I it feels like
you're riding a boat like you have so
much space you make a u-turn there's
oncoming traffic and also no making a
three-point turn and a middle of a busy
intersection because I couldn't perform
a simple u-turn this segment of
firstworldproblems is brought to you so
angry
having us such an expensive car I know
it doesn't even turn itself around on a
u-turn
come on Ilan it does Park it so it does
that is actually really nice of shitty
I'm kind of upset with you on
you started here when I got that car
I was promised autopilot and all these
great features you say for full
self-driving yeah no not just autopilot
2.0 which still hasn't been updated
beyond the basic one that you started
with yeah I mean it's on relative parity
I think two ought to put autopilot 1.0
but it will get better I mean we got
Auto wipers guys ry person can already
take me everyone's just like alright
I'll get over it yeah all right
Tesla driving I know you were able to
but I hate just you were able to sell
the Model 3 or s oh yeah it sold like
immediately really really nice what did
you get a good price for it yeah I mean
the thing is I just wanted it to cover
the cost of the model 3 so I didn't
really care you didn't lose out I did
yeah that's but then my insurance
payments are much lower oh yeah cost of
ownership in general is just lower which
is nice for me god bless you know trying
to save money alright thank you for
sharing that experience yep I'll see you
next and next on chapter 2 of Elon Musk
oh did you get a boring company
flamethrower now I'm just like coming
across like some out-of-touch dude who
just spends money on stupid things is
that a yes I did I regret not buying one
you should I think it's sold out it is
sold out so I don't know who knows we
were talking about it I was like when
people get it everybody will know
there's gonna be all these lunatic
youtubers running around with yeah
flamethrowers then there's the whole
talk about is it technically a
flamethrower because the flame needs to
be a certain distance long outside of
like after the nozzle and it's not
really it's like a flamethrower in the
terms of that it's like a weed burner
it's a weed burner we Berta that's been
attached to a retrofitted airsoft gun
but the reason I purchased it one cuz
it's fun but to like I actually really
like the boring company's idea and this
is how they raise capital and like
awareness so if I can be if I have like
500 bucks to spend sure god buzz just
helped a billionaire with another
company yeah that thing could be a
collectible someday I won't be surprised
it's just a fun thing yeah I don't know
I don't know I don't like to probably
reenact
 yeah sorry
well yeah I'm gonna bring everything in
sight um house first that'd be a fun
video I really just want to I want to
turn into Sigourney Weaver's character
from aliens that's my goal oh my god
imagine the cosplay wow did you not put
that on silent I put mine on airplane
mode well I respect you is that then
that's Dan oh my god son of a gun dang
it Dan I that is horrible I hate that
setting right this is why your parents
divorced and this is not approved I
don't know if that's true Danny's
parents divorcing anything he's crying
to it all right you just moved back here
from New York right uh yeah you were
working for beam yes how did ya I mean
how was everything I know many people
heard the news that beam was disbanded
canceled axed kiboshed I don't know why
I'm being more like Ben well how yeah
well I'm just curious how first of all
how are you you you made a big life
change recently yeah I mean I'm fine I
don't ever regret the decisions that I
make generally because it was a learning
experience like did it turn out
successfully for all his purposes no but
I learned a lot from it I like the fact
that I was living both in New York and
LA which is like a very nice thing to do
is kind of fun pretty sweet it was sweet
it's kind of difficult though all the
time because when you're trying to be
creative like focusing all of your
energy on to one thing gets a little bit
diffused when you have something else
that you're supposed to be focusing on
right I'm sure you guys know that just
from all the projects that you work hard
to keep that up but I'm I mean I think
it's fine I like the fact that we could
we were given the opportunity to do what
we wanted to do we didn't really fulfill
that but I have no
real hard feelings or bad feelings like
the only thing I I was a little upset
about was how it was handled because
basically we're gonna tell you and then
hey in two weeks we're like immediately
basically everything's changed
there was no ramp up period - it was
just this immediate turn over all this
so tell me about like how how did you
get the news like how did it happen you
said it happened immediately right yeah
so I woke up to a BuzzFeed article you
didn't know everything was great I had a
notion or - just from my talks with
people that something was up I didn't
think it was going to be as drastic as
what had happened hmm
I mean my mind it was like Casey's gonna
just do his own thing and that's fine
and we're still going to run as we were
for the rest of this year right and find
our own footing that wasn't the case
obviously I found out it was actually so
it was my birthday was the day with
everything was announced so I was like
all these text messages and they were
all were like happy birthday what
happened to being so that I googled it
and there was this BuzzFeed article
because it hadn't been announced to the
company yet how does that have well
Casey's vlog about it he accidentally
made public before it was supposed to
and that then triggered the BuzzFeed
article to come out Wow Wow and then
Casey pulled his video but buzz we
didn't pull their article found out
either through Casey's accidental vlog
or the BuzzFeed article before they were
actually told how did you feel when you
found out so you were reading beam is
being shut down yeah I was like I woke
up did you believe it we like are you
sure cuz I don't know I believed it yeah
I believed it it was it was an
interesting experience because I was
just I was in LA when that happened so I
was just talking to everybody in New
York while they were going like oh we're
going up to find out if we still have
jobs I mean everyone basically
everyone's like offered jobs and if they
decided today it was up to them yeah not
maybes in there
I think only three people on the team
were actually let go outside of myself
Casey and Matt like three full time
members were actually like oh everyone
else out of the other like 25 people
we're still offer auditioning yeah so
they handled I mean they gave people the
opportunity to like hey you can still
grow and build whatever you want to
within CNN if that's what you choose
that's nice but for me didn't really
make sense anymore
yeah were you were you relieved or were
you sad by the news
I'm always sad when you don't get to do
what you want like when you're not in
charge of your own destiny is always
kind of a sad feeling for me but what
did I plan come April when my lease was
up in New York I'd planned to move back
full-time here and just when they needed
me fly in and help with productions or
whatever but really take a back seat
which is always kind of the plan I
wasn't supposed to be part of the news
team forever the idea was like KC and I
helped set the tone for what the news
team is and then after three months we
move on to working on other projects
under the beam banner and we never got
to that point so that was the main thing
we had a lot of ideas for things that we
wanted to create together that we never
got to yeah and that's always sad seeing
ideas die right why do you think that it
didn't work out well I'm also one for
dramatic purposes to to think about what
I'm actually led to say um I mean I
honestly what Casey said in his vlog
about him just kind of disappearing from
the entire team is is a large part of
that and there's two sides of it I think
one people were disappointed because
they were kind of promised that hey
you're gonna be making videos with Casey
and that's a lot of pressure to put on
to one person yeah like hey Casey like
run this whole thing manage everything
yeah it's like okay well I could just do
my own stuff and be more successful at
that right and I can do anything that I
want and not have to rely on other
people and then from that some people
took that as like oh we've been
abandoned and they just shut down others
kind of what were that like I'm gonna
make something myself but obviously
having Casey is like a figureheads a
very important thing to have especially
when you're trying to gain audience for
something and with that not there I just
think that it seemed less of an
incentive to keep it going
Casey wasn't really involved it wasn't
in the videos towards the end of the
rodeo yeah he was just saying I guess
was he just not I mean I don't wanna
like confusion about the identity of
them yeah like he was there to kind of
direct us creatively and he wasn't and
I'm not trying to put the blame on him I
think like I was thinking about this a
lot and even seeing it and experiencing
it I do a similar thing right it's
easier to be like okay I'm just gonna
separate myself from this so if it fails
it's not really my fault like I was
leaving a part of it right and there is
a lot of pressure where you know the
dude
going from making videos by himself
doing anything he wants myself now you
have a team of 10 people they have to be
in charge and CNN's like okay this is
the new vice news now go get it yeah we
didn't really have which I think there
was a lot of just miss communications
where I remember I was actually we could
go last year that I started at Beeman
was just Casey and I and this other guy
and we were just making stuff for like
trying to make things that was really
really fun because was just us creating
things didn't worry about anyone else
yeah and then like a month later where
he's like hey we just hired nine new
people we have to figure out how these
cogs fit into this machine that hadn't
been built yet so we're trying to build
it around the pieces that were inside
where we should have kind of been doing
it the other way so I get it like it was
just a lot of stress and pressure and so
I get it
well it was a cool experience um really
cool videos it was a it's a shame I feel
like because I felt the last video you
guys made about cryptocurrency yeah I
remember and I was like man I felt like
kind of just I don't know I felt like a
little nostalgia already for it being
gone and I really I was like this was so
cool this was a great video and I wanted
I kind of felt like you guys were maybe
just starting to hit your stride a
little bit I think we had honestly in my
mind once the pressure of like Casey
need to be involved was gone everyone
took these kind of breath was like oh we
can just do what we want now we're not
trying to aim for someone else's
guidelines or someone else's vision
we're just gonna do what we want yeah
and I even did that I mean I'm guilty as
well where I kind of took a back seat it
was like I'm just like you guys do this
but then with that crypto mining piece I
was like you know what actually enjoy
this like Jack who was in the video with
me let's just go make this ourselves
mm-hmm and I think if I had done more of
that then maybe things might be
different I don't really know but I
didn't I was never when I was hired I
was never supposed to be on camera right
and that's what really appealed to me
was like I'm gonna be behind care and
help run things right and not have to be
this person who's dictating and
directing and like moving it through it
was a different thing yeah it was a
whole new thing yeah but it's fine I
will our title was director of
production yeah but I learned a lot from
it and I'm happy for that a great
experience yet about anything like I
learned a lot I met a lot of new people
that I really liked and we got to even
make a video together yeah real baby
Dasia so I don't I'm not upset about it
I feel bad for the I mean also I'm very
fortunate I had two jobs I was doing
Vsauce and this at the same time so I
lost one job oh no what am I gonna do
I'll just move back to LA I guess I'm
continuing my other job to be able to
focus on that more do you feel inspired

good friend and sweetheart who came
donned in garbs his garb derogatory or
is that I mean just means clothing right
as far as I know yeah but I mean at this
point you could pretty much link
anything to some sort of derogatory yeah
yeah garb is racist somehow guys
somebody heard about the marijuana thing
yeah that's a no-go now
he Cox from Smosh is here to co-host
with us today as we journey through
giggles laughs romps and writes through
this top of them I don't know why this
is a new thing I'm doing is pointing at
the camera like that we're touching tips
yeah I'm loving it it's powerful yes you
and ELA before we begin let me first
congratulate you on your new black book
err yes whack book errr the air it's the
pro the wack book bro but thank you and
yeah there's a little bit
a fight happening in our family right
now because Ethan is like anti a Mac
yeah I don't like mackerel product I
don't like the company I don't like the
product I don't like anything about them
and Gila knows that I feel this strongly
buts about it and so she's still going
behind my back this is like a cheating
hmm then I tried to tell him Ethan
please don't kill my vibe it's it's
never a good idea loyalty over
electronics because there's always gonna
be something that surpasses it a year
later like I used to I used to be a big
hater of denim jeans none of that's
electron now how can you hate denim I
don't know like I I didn't wear jeans
for like five years and I don't know why
would you wear corduroy I think I just
was trying to feel special about
something what do you just straight
chords you know yeah card just junior
agro cargo shorts this is right this is
early two-thousands okay it was
acceptable to wear cargo shorts khakis
are good a little it wasn't a good time
for fashion in general yeah the early
2000s you go back there yeah you know
you got you got Britney Spears in and JT
showing up in all denim right you it was
it was a push back on on what you saw it
was my revolt yeah I used to not wear
down and and actually I was funny I made
funny you said well would you wear
corduroy I said that because that's what
I used to wear yeah middle school I
would only wear corduroy pants and now
when I think but I'm not against denim
yeah I don't I'm not put us I've not put
like a stake in the ground sure like I
have with Mac Mac it's overpriced
the company I don't like the way they
run the company ELA gets in today the
first thing she's like oh my god I
forgot my dongle oh I need to sign it to
Apple ID future the future is the future
guess what guys we've got a really
exciting new invention where you have to
care
around the second piece if we want to
use headphones nicer now but now but now
it won't like if you accidentally yank
your cord it'll take your laptop off
with it right because I have an older
back book that has like the magnetic
thing right those I think kind of made
sense yeah it was like the so like the
old Xbox controllers how they had like
the cord the ripper yeah I had like we
would like rip away that's just gonna
take your laptop with it
of course I think that's actually what
Apple wants though especially after they
now that now that they made the iPhones
water-resistant I feel like they
resisted resisted they resisted for a
long time making their phones
water-resistant because they made they
want so much money because of people
dropping their phones and toilets we
could have done this decades ago oh yeah
they're missing out on a lot of money
now that of course now they make their
phones break easier right because now
they're all glass and everything yeah
you breathe on it wrong and they fixed
way so how much did that laptop cost you
EULA I cost me $3,400 damn and hurt yeah
yeah it's my money too by the way
but I so far I only had like this stupid
gaming laptops are pretty I'm not a
gamer but it's like who's really good
for anything you know I was like a razor
not a name-brand
yeah right we but it's like so bulky
it's here right yeah like whenever we
travel like I have back pain afterwards
oh it's awful she said I need a I need a
laptop that feels like air what I'm
carrying it around and apples like got
you fam whack book Eric was born this is
huge because we've always you know it's
passionate so mm-hmm
I let it go well here's what's happening
the stage is set for a tech off h3h3
tech reviews I'm shopping around to find
a PC or Windows machine that closest
resembles the wack book and so I am
looking at one and I'm doing it
specifically by weight right
they had slick it's it's so light right
this thing weighs about four point three
pounds likes water yeah my shredder
that's what a cutie pie that should
always be your metric like how many
shredders and weights yeah so I'm
looking for one shredder wait I want
basically the same way I think I'm gonna
be able to get a larger hard drive more
RAM a faster processor a better video
card for less but the question is you
will see the question is and it's not
even the matter of like processing speed
its usability its they got it I'll say
they've very sleek they're you've got a
slight thing going on this is not an ad
for any company which is coming with a
fart noise Dan seriously good idea
that's what I'm he's like do we have any
[ __ ] [ __ ] sounds I can blast and just
go good morning
AM radio I mean every once in a while
the the fart noise comes in handy yeah
it's not saying you overuse it but when
you can't discount a good fart yeah
anyway so the stage is set I think this
weekend I'm gonna get my own golden boy
PC stands for probably cooler this stage
is set for an epic tech battle until
then let's get enough about max let's
get on with it let's get on to I was
really important headline first story of
the day I think everybody's gonna be
wowed by if you catch my drift let me
open this in Australia they probably the
goofiest country in on the planet Earth
hmm hundreds of people gathered to say
wow like Owen Wilson let that sink in my
friends goofiest country on earth and I
mean that in a great way they're playful
they're fun I love mm-hmm
yep Owen Wilson is a very popular on the
internet for the way pronounces the word
Wow and now he's driving longing for her
that ever really know he has a thing
like in his movie
he always plays the same character and
he goes wow that's not the only word
that he says though he also has other
phrases that he's brought into other
things so he's like that's crazier than
a road lizard right he's literally said
that phrase and it was that's crazier
than a road lizard I don't think that
analogy is very compelling well he's
he's putting in a lot of his movies and
I don't know he does apparently a
disagree with me Owen Wilson saying Wow
so let's just see if this is actually a
meme before we get it definitely is so
here do you think the Wow is ever
actually in the script or that's just
always a tub of talent that's they
assume that when they get when they book
him it comes with a certain amount Wow
yeah yeah when the writing Family Guy
they're like we need you know twenty
jokes per minute mm-hmm so in Ellen's
case they're like we're gonna need ten
miles per scene it's fair that's fair
yeah so anyway let's get let's get back
to it
yada yada yada and these times I think
something as silly is getting together
and saying WOW can have a positive
effect and I'd like to see everyone come
together it could remind people that
this world we are lucky to inhabit is
beautiful and to embrace that like Owen
Wilson does in his movies by saying wow
wait did I read okay let's just watch
the ideal Wow
I like that guys focus on on his
campaign it just goes straight to the
chest and just hangs there
[Applause]
I'm kind of I'm kind of underwhelmed I
thought they were gonna give like a
countdown like three two one Wow but it
was just actually agree I was expecting
I wasn't it's a free for I wasn't
expecting a free for all
yeah y'all kept brought the time to come
together let's at least do it all come
on Australians the other I bet we can
put this together we wanted to we got to
do a different different phrase though
like they did the Wow we got to do
desserts in the robe or whatever
everyone knows home well yeah yeah I've
seen in Shanghai noon here's another
angle in case anybody was need to see
this do you think it's quite an hour
consulted Bibles
he's wild
all right well yeah I mean you know what
we're pretty great it's fun it's silly
it's fun it's playful
it's wow although it doesn't top my
favorite well which will of course
forever be mmm this class I don't have
ever heard the sound I've always just
seen it Wow yeah that's the best Wow
this guy man well Wow yeah I've never
actually heard the voice but it actually
it fit yeah he's great yeah that's a
closet
alright well I thought that was a lot of
fun let's get started waitis you know
open it up see what's out there some
good things you know so this next one
this stuff triggers me a little bit okay
so you guys may have heard of the story
of this hot teacher that [ __ ] her 14
year old student have you seen this
which one yeah it happens a lot I mean
it does seem to happen a lot it happens
from time to time let me roll this
report well let's start here 26 year old
science teachers Stephanie Peterson
walked into her first appearance at the
Volusia County Jail this afternoon
hoping to be released with just a
promise that she would be back to court
Volusia County sheriff's deputies say
Peterson engaged in a sexual
relationship with a 14 year old former
student of hers the teen told deputies
it began last November he said Peterson
would send him nude pictures of herself
she would also pick him up from his
house late at night so that they live
together investigators say the boy's
parents called law enforcement in
January and deputies arrested Peterson
on Wednesday
Peterson was charged with two counts of
lewd and lascivious battery and one
count of sending harmful material to a
minor her bond set at $25,000 and that's
why she wanted to be released on her own
recognizance today but the judge met her
halfway reducing her bond to $12,500 an
amount she posted almost immediately
dangerous winter storms are threatening
so well that's that's that's just
right so she hasn't been charged yet
that's true that's her bail but the
charges were just like lewd conduct or
something not like statutory rape which
is what you would expect to see if the
positions were switched that guy would
be like underground but the part the
thing that really the the reaction to a
story like this is very typical and this
is this the picture that everyone's
sharing here let me show you this is the
one that I see on Facebook and read it
where everyone's like oh man we're with
my teacher like that where's my fight so
she just sent the photos like she didn't
actually and everyone's like oh man
where was that where's that teaching
around the kid right my my counter to
that is is that this kid like people
think like when when when a young girl
has sex with an older guy how damaging
that must be right huh I think that it's
equally damaging for a man except they
just don't know it because society like
here's the comments on reddit everyone's
like that was awesome yeah of course
yeah you know what here's here's real
comments and where the [ __ ] were these
dream makers when I was a kid how damn I
wish I was that guy am I supposed to
pretend that if that woman [ __ ] when I
was 14 I would have been in a goddamn
paradise so as you said HeLa yet a horny
13 year old guy would would put his dick
in anything that moved right because we
talked about it earlier and I'm like
it's her responsibility not to do that
because it's so [ __ ] up when you're
like when I look back at myself at that
age oh my god I probably thought I'm
like an adult man you know yeah and by
now looking back it's like embarrassing
yes how you're not and just I don't know
it's him so he's 14 14 is kind of insane
my niece is 40 yeah but in that
perspective in my head
but the thing is like I think I barely
danced with a girl when I was 14
yeah I think I I almost kissed a girl
and ran away yeah
yeah that's that's I mean it's sketchy
it's sketchy it's it's just gross either
way so the thing is that like I think it
would damage somebody in ways they
wouldn't right like that's how you grow
up as a dude who tattoos on his arm like
big [ __ ]
like that's how you end up like someone
you know a couple of those people but
I'm saying like you will turn into a per
oh I think a worse person if this
happened you
it would [ __ ] with it would hardwire
your brain in a [ __ ] up way that you
it would do something yeah it's not good
it's not good
there was a reason it's not allowed you
know some of these comments this makes
me this makes me absolutely sick lucky
little [ __ ] I know it's a double
standard but when I was 14 and banging
my hottest [ __ ] teacher I'd be stuck I
seriously doubt this kid was damaged in
any way irresponsible and stupid on her
part yes it's not like she held him down
and forced herself on him we don't have
that I don't think that is well well it
doesn't matter I guarantee this kid was
all about it this would be what I
considered a victimless crime buying him
marijuana was she also bought a
marijuana by the way cool yeah so this
is a victimless crime but it's like
would you say the same thing of a 14
year old girl [ __ ] a 30 year old guy
and it's like oh she wanted it there
would be pitchforks yeah there would be
burning there would be burning of the
monster Frankenstein
anyway III always found this double
standard to be quite ludicrous yeah it's
definitely nothing new every time one of
those stories comes out people are like
oh yeah it's like good no it's still a
it's still a 20 was 26
yes 26 year old also in the relationship
of somebody in authority having a sex
with somebody they're supposed to be
taken care of yes is is twisted it's an
abuse of power yeah it's a little scary
yeah I don't know what was going through
either of their minds the kid he can't
he's blameless am i cause like yeah like
I said I put my dick and anything that
moved at that age literally that's
completely under adult
in that situation - in my opinion - all
right what do you think about it dad one
more thing for teachers to worry about
you can't even I can't [ __ ] my teenage
students anymore yeah that's true and I
got a carry gun wait you're telling me
I'm not getting a racist here and I
can't affect my 13 year old students
darn well at least I'll have a gun you
know what I love about this argument
about arming teachers hmm just like two
days ago there was a story of a teacher
barricading themselves and shooting up a
classroom yeah let's give them more guns
the least stressful job in the world
they'll be fine [ __ ] insane it's
gotta be one of the most insane thing
I've heard arming teachers yeah we
talked about it last episode but it's it
really I'm sure the comments love that
discussion I'm sure everyone is really
civil and kind in the comic you know
what I would love to hear if there's
anybody out there who genuinely believes
that we should arm teachers you want to
have a conversation about it Colin are
we ready for Colin Stan we weren't we
are not during the break so if you're
out there and you think oh let's give
teachers guns elementary school teachers
guns Colin let's talk about it I'm all
for arming teachers as long as we get
those smart bullets that avoids the good
guys and just only hits the bad guys
because apparently Apple is working on
that really help you need the log in
mid-air here I phone account so anyway
that's Story number two Wow can we get
that on the sound board please Dan yeah
definitely with a fart directly after it
just this this show is developed in Big
Time - welcome Cheers up next Papa John
severs ties with the N
F Wow and and even worse than that is
that they've been replaced by pizza
mm-hmm do you think Papa John's mention
is that risk Papa John's Pizza mansion
yeah um no I sold enough pies by now man
I I hope I was doing okay better than
the delivery guy I'm sure yeah as long
as he doesn't turn out like the kid that
played Anakin oh yeah oh yeah he was not
happy about being Anakin he got trashed
on him and he was going to school and he
I feel bad got all messed up
he got messed up and then like the kid
who played young Darth Vader and the
original prequels really everybody
trashed on the support kid cuz he was an
awful actor and he was an awful actor
but it's not his fault he's eight year
old right and so when he grew up and
went to school you know you can imagine
the torment that this poor kid went
through that's not the kid was an awful
actor yeah it wasn't it wasn't ruined
ruined Star Wars for me if you look at
the prequels is it really the actors
faults well old Anakin kind of there are
good kid actors and when you're making a
Star Wars prequel with the budget of
like 50 billion you there's a good
there's a good connector out there can
imagine it's also hard to write for
children because most of people that are
writing these are like I don't know 30
40 50 years old right and now they're
trying to write in the mindset of a
child right yeah that is a talent though
that writers do have right there are
writers maybe yeah
I'm just saying they have the resources
there like here's 50 billion dollars we
can find someone who can write the
dialogue of a child and we should be
able to find a child they could do
though you're saying people should blame
the writers not the kids your blame
George Lucas I'd say yeah I'd say blame
the writers more than more than the
actors you can like a good actor can
only act so good yeah with the script
that they're given I think writers don't
give it interesting enough pressingly

live great you know it's funny I've it's
like what can you do you know it's part
of the magic right the first episode we
did live
I made some we had a filthy Frank here I
don't even know how we got in this
conversation about like rape and nature
settings like how animals rape each
other right and I was like yeah I was
just saying some stupid [ __ ]
I don't know how why would I even be
talking about that and I say something
that sounded really bad and George is
sitting behind it goes and that haunts
me forever so if you can drop that I
want to say before we get too deep and
if you guys have questions for Shane
about him ghost stories conspiracy
theories whatever is on your mind give
us a ring at one eight one eight two one
four eight
5:04 god bless him I want to get right
in to the juice okay okay we had spoken
a couple weeks back when all this
Twitter garbage was exploding about
there was allegations and let me just
say utter and stupid absolute trash and
garbage that you are a pedophile yes
tell me about how how did you find out
about this it was crazy the night before
it happened I got a DM from keemstar I
thought as I made a joke that Dana
videos saying like Oh
keemstar is gonna DME about being a
child molester cuz I flew out a fan who
was 14 to my house interesting and I
made like a joke what a twist I know two
days before that in a MOOC bang with
Trisha Paytas a MOOC Bank it's where you
order a lot of food when you eat it on
camera
I've heard of a bank a joke about how
you go eat one meal and then immediately
eat another meal that's my life I just
thought that was I never heard of that I
might be saying it wrong it might be
mukbang either way sounds I love bank
and food somehow it's great I'll get to
the gangbang in a second Christ no but I
made a joke saying like you know my
friend was like oh ho people like you
right now and I'm like well it comes in
waves like in you know every two years
people hate me and I said and it's
ticking like two years is coming so like
by tomorrow something Bad's gonna happen
I'm gonna be like whatever and literally
ya the next day anyways so I thought the
video was a joke like I thought it was a
parody because of the way it was edited
it said I because my boyfriend and
previous girlfriend have baby faces I
want to [ __ ] a babies I'm like clearly
this is a joke right
and then yeah it just became a thing
it's just so stupid it was the channel
was pop blast hmm
as everybody knows some respects table
interestingly they made the video called
Shane Dawson is a pedophile that was the
title of it here's proof it had the
channel I'm really actually happy to say
that YouTube just straight up and
deleted it yeah they're like smell you
later idiots but the thing that really
twisted my panties into a full not was
like this stupid rip reputation las'
channel makes a video and Twitter
flippin news it's the number I open
because Twitter news people respect the
people look at it now yeah you click the
thing number one you had like the
flagship story a legate people are
saying Shane Dawson's a pedophile for 48
hours which they've never done before
like in America even with the shootings
three hours after the shooting in
Florida it was like this sushi roll has
amazed
okay that deserves longer than you know
but it was crazy so the craziest part
was there was no allegation like it was
literally so dumb literally me talking
about [ __ ] babies or something on a
podcast which was stupid
five or six years ago but that's not now
like geisha she's making a joke yeah no
kid came forward or no parent award it's
like oh whatever people are saying yeah
so that was a confusing part and I had
people at the gym you know like looking
at me weird and humility Starbucks
looking at me weird and it was a thing
people thought I was a [ __ ] pedophile
for cuz of her news yeah the it actually
was even it this conspiracy had legs
like there was even it wouldn't even a
level further people were saying Logan
Paul's manager paid money to get the
video up to take heat off him I guess it
was right after the dead body yeah I
think what happened was I think it was a
parody I think the person who made it
liked my conspiracy videos know who I'm
gonna like make one about Shane okay
clearly a joke and then because it it
went too far and somebody cut it up even
more and put it on Twitter they took not
the jokey parts and I think that person
was like oh no okay how do I make it
obvious that this was fake so then they
started putting out these weird like
clues and then the Logan Paul email and
and then their channel got deleted so oh
that sucks for them if it was just like
meant to me I think it was because it
was so stupid right there evidence of me
[ __ ] my boyfriend who has a baby food
yeah that's so crazy that I'm like and
there was scary music under it so I
think it was a joke than what you fart
and then the news because poor son of a
[ __ ] was trying to make like a homage
to you in a way maybe once you know once
it got like out of hand
that's I don't know I can't think of the
alternative because it's like well if it
was some person that was trying to ruin
my life they wouldn't have put the
baby-faced stuff in there you know what
I mean so who was it and it was well
edited hmm so are they ha because I just
find it so disturbing that Twitter
broadcasted that as if it was something
serious for so long yeah was there any
repercussions to that oh my god yeah
it was it was nuts personally it was
nuts my family it was really bad just
because like that word is so triggering
sure you know like I've been molested
like it's a long-running thing in my
family it's very I'm very anti pedophile
like everybody else but no but from a
personal yeah and all my I've done so
many videos about child molesters in
Hollywood and I'm like very actively
like trying to shut that [ __ ] down so
when it came back at me and people
called me a pedophile that's the worst
thing they could call me literally the
worst I can't think of anything else
yeah but yeah money-wise it [ __ ] me up
it I lost you know brand deals and I my
certain things that were supposed to
happen are happening anymore just
because of that
dude that's and even now that it's kind
of like I'm settled you still have lost
those connections everybody says it's
not why like oh no it's other reasons
like oh this this one away because of
other things I'm like really like it
happened two days after the pedophile
thing and then it just went away
did you hear what about like YouTube how
did they react because they're so
sensitive to everything these days they
were supportive they know they know they
were like listen we know you didn't do
anything but like you know it's hot off
the heels of low compulsion but handle
another greater controversy yeah but
they were like you know it was very much
like let's see what happens and the
story died pretty quickly
yeah it's not a story I didn't [ __ ] it's
like there is no story there's nowhere
to go oh the best though was like all
the websites the news websites that
we're doing stories on it one of them
used a picture of me holding a baby doll
it's like from Instagram of me like
holding baby dolls because it's like a
sex toy or something yeah what that was
the craziest part dude it's so crazy to
me that like something on this scale
with no merit at all yeah it's like this
me too thing is so click worthy or like
these allegations are
nobody's even thinking it twice about it
but what about like I don't know do some
research like especially as a brand
watch the video all of a sudden is gonna
cancel somewhere yeah you know are you
not gonna check like you I can just say
it about anyone but that's it it's so
dangerous now because even if they
watched it and they're like this is
stupid
people are gonna have that Association
and we just don't want that yeah people
are gonna hold it against them yeah yeah
what was crazy with some youtubers were
like some people in general we're
tweeting things oh you should have made
those jokes or you shouldn't have had
that conversation on a podcast whatever
and kind of making it seem like it was
my fault which I understand but also
like a lot of those people I'm like you
know this could happen to anybody
laughs like they took a thing from six
years ago and edited it imagine like all
of us have hours of content yeah could
happen to anybody
anyone cleanest person in the world I
just Dean who knows I I completely agree
it could happen to anyone
there's no question about it I have some
old videos boy but also they should all
be unlisted now it's a huge difference I
think we will need to make the
difference between like you made a
shitty joke that you shouldn't have made
to this guy's a pedophile that's insane
they are so far from each other yeah
it's such a jump well one of the points
you brought up that I something that
infuriates me is that there are
suspected and arrested pedophiles and
sexual abusers who are working in
Hollywood right now and people are
wasting their time talking about that
[ __ ] um you know about this guy
Bryan Singer I've talked about him on
the podcast here before what do you know
about Bryan Singer what do you say like
that that is like I have filmed a
conspiracy video about him six times and
I always edit him out because I'm scared
it's dangerous
oh oh he's scary it's [ __ ] up so you
know probably that meant several people
have brought lawsuits against him that
have mysteriously and inexplicably
been dropped for no reason you know
other than oh I changed my mind I mean
there's a whole documentary about ya
know pain and that wig dude
open secret creaking and so decided
herbed me so much yeah and that the
woman who directed it like what two
years before that she won an Oscar for
her previous documentary and people are
like she's the next big thing the second
she released that blacklisted from
everybody are you serious yeah cuz I
mean she's opening I've been on the
YouTube side of it not to say you know
here I go conspiracy but you know I
talked about the child porn on YouTube
like two years ago like the spider-man
else's show even worse there's even
darker [ __ ] people like like parents who
dress up like a doctor and pull kids
pants down put syringe and like these
crazy channels that I've been talking
about for two years telling YouTube hey
everybody in my agents everybody take it
down take ten bro I have the same
experience and they're like mmm they're
like Shane I'm gonna blacklist you very
much like shut up right on of me which
makes me think you think I'm the way
that I see it I think that's giving them
too much credit
mm-hm think they're more like they just
always have a problem right they're
always dealing with something and you
think of YouTube is like a we're a bunch
of slick-ass tech guys and everything's
under control
there's like 20 people like high up
there who are doing everything I feel
like yeah and what's hard from their
point of view is like where do you draw
the line on stuff like when is a
spider-man also video okay and when is
it not yeah it's kind of hard to say
like can you tailor a rat if it's dead
at what point there are channels who
have done it and I don't know
like Liza Coe she you know has a video
and I love her has a video where she's
like stabbing a dead fish
really which like me whatever it's it's
a whatever but so is that that different
that different it still is [ __ ] up I
would never teach her rap no like it's
like a weird like we're is the line yeah
it's it's a tough job that they have
it's it is a tough job
I was just twitch just came out with new
guidelines and it's just funny the
position these companies are in now
because a lot of people have been
like Teddy streamers on Twitch and so
they made these new guidelines were like
okay you can wear a dress like this is
okay this is okay this isn't okay like
they actually have like a gradient of
cleavage show as now that's acceptable
but it's kind of ridiculous to be in
that position you know which isn't okay
so twitch yes so that's not like camphor
there it's there's not like a porn
section of it no there should be Frank
they're looking for more traffic well I
guess a lot of people on twitch twitch
streamers complain that girls they like
to work for tips and stuff like that the
problem with twitch bromwich though is
that unlike YouTube where there's enough
there's enough space for everyone
because you can watch one video you can
watch another video on Twitch you've got
live broadcast and you can't enjoy
everyone at once so they're like this
working for tips and I'm trying to be
entertaining here and I can't compete
with them [ __ ] titties I got a helmet
on my second monitor you guys know my
titties yeah they don't have to that's
it's a competitive advantage that's
something that's going on in the world
Brian finger oh wait
that guy is a he just the guy he's made
so many movies and shows and he's still
making a ton of [ __ ] with like the
highest of people in Hollywood like damn
well he so in the open secret you saw
the one of his little partners back in
the day mm-hmm is now really high up in
Bitcoin really I didn't think maybe it
wasn't in the documentary but yeah it's
everything is so connected so it's
creepy
oh sorry we have a soundboard and that's
it that's Carlos for the connect why are
pedophiles so well organized because
it's it's about power
hmm oh that's interesting I think
pedophiles this is gonna get me [ __ ]
in whatever whatever I genuinely do
think though that there is like a lot of
people in power that are because it is
about when you have billions of dollars
and you have make sense you get bored
right and you're kind of [ __ ] up and
evil it's like so it's like how else
that's dark just like man I'm bored I'm
gonna go [ __ ] a baby you look at the
Bible not that I like read the Bible or
whatever but but if you look though like
that in history it's like people have
that high of power turn to murder they
turn to pedophilia they turn to you know
mmm all the dark [ __ ] because they're
[ __ ] bored hostile like stabbing
people for money it's just like you know
I do find what you said interesting
about power because it's clearly is a
power thing the whole pedophile and I
think someone who that appeals to also
would love being in a position of money
and power and controlling people and I
don't even know though if it's like I
don't even think they start out as
Pettit like those types of people I
don't even think they start out as
pedophile I think it's like a it's in
there but I think it just they develop a
taste for it well there's also this
company that like sells young blood draw
me dude you've got my all the weirdest
tell me about this there's a company
that sells young I've never even heard
that term you sell like a middle one I
don't remember where it's happening does
that cannibalism maybe I'd sell my blood
honestly at this point you probably
would get a polymer trouble mm-hmm crime
I'll just give it to you right a blood
prime amazon would love that and I met
young as in like 18 I'm not talking
about okay okay I don't know good all
right horrible house this whole but
going back has do you feel like the
whole allegations have settled against
you do you feel like it's all laid to
rest now right yeah I mean I'm not a
pedophile so it's like this thing of for
me it was more like okay I'm
pedophile so where do we go where I like
when you know other things have happened
with my other bad jokes I've made in the
past like I have this guilt and I feel
like constantly like I'm sorry I'm sorry
I'm sorry I'm sorry but this mic I'm not
a pedophile so can we you know what I
mean and I think people did move on yeah
I mean all your all all of your
colleagues on YouTube everyone was just
like this is so stupid
yeah so there's that that always is nice
to see it seems like you've made a
significant like shift and your content
and how you manage your channel and
everything and I know that as a youtuber
knowing a lot of youtubers that's one of
the hardest things to do is to make like
a huge shift or to reinvent yourself
especially in a way where your fans like
and it seems like your channel is doing
I don't know better than ever can you
say that it's doing great let's say that
how did you manage to pull that off I
mean now tell me run tell me about your
thought process going through that I
kind of subconsciously change it every
year interesting I think just because
for me I get a little bored and then you
know but this this this specific year
was different because I for the last you
know 10 years my thought process was
like oh I need to get off of youtube I
need it this is just I'm gonna make
movies and TV and this and that and then
I kind of came to the conclusion that
like oh no like [ __ ] like YouTube is
really cool and people actually are
starting to respect it more and like I
should just make [ __ ] I would make on TV
or movies on my channel so that's kind
of what I've been doing it's a lot more
work I want more money and you know
stuff but I'm actually like really proud
of it now like a year ago I don't know
if I would have said I was of that proud
of like eating pizza on camera you know
you can tell that your production
quality is definitely really impressive
now it feels like I'm watching a show oh
that's it's yeah it's right and like
you're doing it every day yeah that's
gotta be pretty nutty yeah I mean now
it's kind of [ __ ] up like sometimes
it's just three videos a week or
sometimes even just two just because
they're like 30
really long yeah and it's just me and
one other person editing all of them and
that's I was wondering if you edit yeah
I used to I've brought in people but the
one I'm using now his name is Andrew he
films and edits because it usually does
one and I do too or he just do I do one
we trade off no it's a lot that's
awesome man
yeah it's super hard to get someone to
edit your is is this guy a new editor
how long has he been editing stuff for
you I didn't even know how new he
literally started editing like a few
months before he added it with me really
welcome everybody to the h3 podcasts

next week's guest is the prolific shane
dawson please post your questions for
him on the subreddit those are very
helpful I just want to say I love you
guys when you go there and share your
opinions it's really helpful so thank
you everyone who participated
about two days guess obviously you've
guessed because there's been banter
already I am very hyped and pleased to
introduce these the great and amazing
rhett and Link who I have to say are a
huge inspiration of why I think we
became youtubers to begin with was
watching you guys stuff I tell a salute
Lee I understand that I wasn't supposed
to talk earlier about the underwear so
now I don't know if I can talk now good
when you throw out a big compliment the
gate is open
you're supposed to smile gently okay I
just might I'm sorry I didn't you
thought was gonna compliment you guys
more right because if the compliments
are still kind yeah you're not done
okay keep going sorry gonna say the
multi-talented song-and-dance bent the
triple-threat you must do well there's
two of us we each have one and a half
well when we had our third member of our
trio who was unfortunately wait that's
mauled triple means a three-man act I
thought it meant like this song maybe by
extending it you it would land yeah I
was trying to save you
well anyway good evening god bless
Tripathi
we don't really dance well well you know
what I guess we do you guys put your
mind yeah you would be straight-up
dancing in the rain I could see you with
an umbrella tap-dancing your way I'm
telling you the triple threat challenge
accepted
yeah it's 7:00 p.m. this is not our
usual time oh I can imagine it's been a
long day for you guys your schedule must
be insane how was your day Thursday is
our work late night so thanks for
accommodating us of course to make this
happen
yeah absolutely and we typically record
our own podcast in the in the in the
late night but instead we're on this one
so more people are gonna listen buns are
very similar so we feel very at home
yeah yeah so thank you for making it's
been a long day though so tell me about
your day what do you guys do today uh
well right now Monday through Thursday
we're shooting GMM so because there's
four videos coming out a day now I
thought it was three it's three good
mythical morning and then there's one
good mythical more that extra yeah so
there's two episodes on Monday one
episode on Tuesday want opposite on
Wednesday and then it Thursdays a
two-episode day but we also do like
we're doing things that just isn't just
us at the desk now so we shot a music
video today on a couple of segments
there's no dancing it's actually almost
like an anti dance
music video where all the dancing is
creating an impost I'm actually not
joking I started to dance at one point
and you're not they told me that I had
to be still beam to a you were right
about the dances we're going to make you
active in post right yeah we were all
the way over here we were just talking
about the first thing we shot this
morning which was with this girl who's a
contortionist and a youtuber as well
Sophie da si is her name
she'll be on upcoming yeah she'll be on
an upcoming episode of good mythical
morning but it's what right now we're in
those days where I'm like that was today
right you know what I mean
oh yeah I don't know if that's a good
thing it's intense it's an intense a lot
of different things there's just a lot
of different we've kind of got into this
habit of just kind of showing up at the
next thing and executing it and then
moving on to the next thing that may be
very different than the thing that was
right before it so you guys are at the
point kind of where you just show up how
involved because now this show has
become something new right so yeah
that's formed recently I mean it's at a
certain point we had to get somebody
else to be in charge of our schedule so
we just said what the parameters were
okay right for the sake of our families
we only want to work this amount of time
and so our only late-night is a Thursday
night and you know then you guys get
jerked around in order to try to you
know accommodate that stirred around but
that's how it for the triple threats no
yeah but it's at any point on any given
day we're worth we're thinking of or
responding to new ideas and just saying
okay yes to this idea no to this idea
shaping this idea and then prepping
other episodes they all said yes to it
that would it would be easier if we were
just showing up but yeah we're still
very much involved in the creative
process and we have a great team of
writers and we're not coming up with
they're coming up with a majority of the
initial ideas but like right before we
came here like the last thing we did
after we shot the music videos we had
like an hour-long meeting with our team
that does all our field shoots so stuff
outside so like
the wind Baker stuff that ready with you
there's that's a different team that
handles that so a different director and
then there's riders assigned to that so
we have a meeting where they kind of
pitch us what they're thinking and then
we change it or update it or give the
thumbs up I mean it used to be and then
where we're stepping into the thing that
we're shooting so when we step into the
thing we're shooting we're accessing
when we prepped it the day or a few days
before and then maybe a few weeks a week
or two before when we said yes we want
to do it so it's a little all removed
from the concepts actually being in yeah
you got to react cess it and say okay
this is this is why I was excited about
this interesting and this is what's
missing that I was excited about that I
have to interject the last second or not
whatever the case may be and it because
yeah it's it's funny we the the
conversation continued between the two
of us earlier and it was like yeah we we
used to work on something we developed
something we'd really believed in it a
video and then we'd work on it all the
way through and then we'd start the next
the next one's like chronological yeah
very linear yeah and I mean because good
mythical morning is so it's so formatted
and it you know it allowed us to hire
people who couldn't make us make it into
a system that then we kids you know not
do everything you step in the desert
yeah but it gets a little crazy
sure next week we're not shooting
anything so we do have every five weeks
we have a dark week so that's six thank
word for you guys man what we're gonna
do though is we're gonna go the two of
us are gonna leave town we're gonna go
someplace and we're gonna come up with
something else to create so really
because we well yeah it's not a vacation
we're still you just escape in yeah well
getting out of the grind of GMM so I
mean cuz we've always had something else
going on at the same time as a good
mythical morning but when it kind of
exponentially increased in November
we had to get a lot smarter about our
time to do those other things so you
guys are involved in like a high level
high high level stuff the concepts
yeah development you think that that I
think that's probably necessary for you
guys to have the time to do other stuff
like what you're describing I mean we
only did so the first two years of GMM
was you know between yes probably ninety
percent us and then starting like the
fourth season or so is when we brought
in Stevie our producer right and she had
some we were just going off of instinct
all along we had no production
experience at all she came in with some
production experience was like
if you guys want to do anything else or
you you want to we need to make this
into more of a system with efficiencies
and we need to hire the right people
interested in and at that point we
started like that was when we made the
transition so this probably 2014 was
probably the first time we started
actually having episodes would go alive
and we hadn't even watched them said
like four years ago or whatever that was
a big transition for us was like oh now
we're putting stuff up that we don't
even watch we were there when we made it
we were there putting in just because
it's you're producing too much or what
yeah because we were doing other things
it was like okay what things are we
gonna let go of so like the process is
you let go of the editing first right so
that's like even for us that was
difficult so that was like 2012 probably
letting go of the editing how did you do
that by the way how did you eventually
come out I like overcome that hurdle cuz
it's so personal
well I mean we were Jason was a guy and
we were over his shoulder like literally
I mean it is if you look at the card
table where we shot the first
incarnation of good mythical morning
right behind the card table were our two
desks push them together like just and
just to the right right out of frame was
his desk like when we were shooting the
show if if I went like this I could have
I could have easily picked it
occasionally it did happen occasionally
just keeping - yeah come on just get a
little prize right dig deep for a little
prize that's my point
well I was I was over his shoulder yeah
I mean it's it's easier again when it I
mean when it's a format like that you
can start to develop and you can you can
nitpick everything and inside and so
next time do that but it wasn't until we
found somebody who in Stevie that it was
like oh this final product that she just
oversaw is almost exactly what we would
have that's great maybe a little
different but it was just as good it was
so it was like good enough yeah cuz I
totally just as good maybe a little
different but in this in some specialist
there yeah but it was there because if
that wasn't the case then we would have
never let go and I know there's a lot of
youtubers that never let go it's hard I
feel like do you guys feel like you were
lucky to find some of that great
extremely I was kind of the catalyst
right for for doing Rancher extremely
lucky because we interviewed a couple
people and she seemed to be like she was
the smartest person that we interviewed
you know that was the thing that we were
like this person's got to be smart we're
not gonna have a lot of patience with
somebody who's not and she just very
quickly demonstrated that she was more
than just a producer she was a creative
partner so um yeah I think that's the
key because people are so and it's very
difficult to find find those people that
you can trust sure but if you can then
you can I mean we would have never done
you know the book or the tour buddy
system or any of that stuff without
being able to step out of you know a
daily show that just takes people are
like oh it's just come it's just 15
minutes a day what do you do the rest of
your time yeah you guys know that it's
it's more than you know me and Neela
tried for a month about a year or two
years ago to make a video every day we
did it for 30 days and we almost got a
divorce
hate it but every daily vlogs do and he
was only eyes like no no help was it
were they blocked no no basically good
mythical morning ripoff it is
inspiration right but obviously without
the production value and without looking
good and being good now listen it was
like a hybrid of like PewDiePie good
mythical morning we were sitting at a
desk right it was an interesting
experiment you know I just wanted to see
what it was like and it was miserable
where he was well you probably I mean
we've met you we've done a lot of stuff
that hasn't worked but you it always
works to teach you a lesson you learned
something from it and at that you almost
always leads to something else it was a
huge formative really important actually
I do really like some of those videos
that we made so it's interesting I don't
know we suffered but we we don't you
don't have to be a lot of people are
paralyzed because they're like I don't
know if this is gonna work though you
gotta quit asking that question because
it probably won't most of us huh yeah
yeah you know do you guys have you guys
have like a golden age you guys been
making content for so long I feel like
we have a golden age like when we look
back at the videos we made when we were
living in Israel uh-huh by the time we
discovered you guys we were just coming
up I just saw your like deprivation tank
video and I was like this is awesome
that's the first video I saw of yours
guys and I don't know I don't know what
there was just like a Wild West vibe
like I can never make those videos now
because they were awful quality there
was [ __ ] he produced they were just
awful but looking back with a certain
charm I guess yeah you guys feel like
you have a golden age of some sort III I
have in my mind well when we were making
our local commercials right mm-hm and we
made the first couple I mean there was
like oh nine maybe yes we made like red
house furniture which like went reeve
iral a couple of weeks ago yeah let's
stretch this so funny so weird 16 years
old YouTube does this thing where
they'll just put like your first video
on everyone's home
Paige all the sudden really I mean not
your first but like they'll go way back
in your catalog right and back here's
this really embarrassing video that you
probably should have unlisted in our
case not your kids algorithm thinks
they're ready for it yeah Jodi
they've earned the right to go deep but
anyway as you were saying we were making
I remember we were making went to
Coleman Alabama and made what we ended
up titling on YouTube epic and honest
used trailer commercial but it was this
guy who had a business Coleman
liquidation he would repo trailers and
single-wide trailers and then he would
he would sell him off his lie so used
mobile homes right this is as bad as it
gets and his name was Robert Lee and we
would we would usually we would have
like a phone interview with the people
to see if they were commercial material
but once we found out his name was
Robert Lee and we talked to his
secretary he we can never get him on the
phone we could never get we could never
get to talk to him in any way but we
said we gotta go to this guy make a
commercial and I remember we were there
making the commercial and he didn't show
up for three hours and we were
documenting it behind the scenes we had
this idea that you know we're gonna
we're just gonna document to making this
commercial so people will believe how
real it is and how little we're actually
doing but we would show we're not
changing his name or anything like that
but it was just the two of us the two of
us would get on a plane with a camera
the camera and so we documented all the
interactions and then with the same
camera the next day after we gathered
all the Intel we shot the commercial so
I think we would set up a second camera
shooting us shooting the commercial yeah
we justify just to make more of a story
on our second Channel right it became
the good mythical morning chance yeah I
know yes okay so Robert Lee finally
shows up after literally waiting for him
for hours like with the camera in my lap
I wanted to capture the moment he walked
in and he you know he walks in and I'm
like scream let's start start filming
he's like
y'all the boys from the commercial and
he just like then for the next hour he
didn't shut up telling stories I'm like
ah this is great
next day we had him like with a chainsaw
cutting down cutting limbs off of trees
in order to get a mobile home out of
this person's yard and sell it the next
day and it was it was just it was crappy
man it was fun you had this guy Minoo
it's just us us trying to make this
thing happen
it's crazy idea just kind of you know
looking at each other while this guy's
got a chainsaw chopped off by this this
guy and then we went back to the hotel
that night and we got on the phone with
Joe Penna mysteryGuitarMan mm-hmm and so
we were we were pitching him on working
with us to make this make a video called
t-shirt war which was like eventually
that became like one of our biggest
viral videos at the time or whatever
around the same time stop-motion 10 or
so so it's so we were we were doing I
guess we were pretty busy I mean we were
doing yeah it sounds we were scrambling
doing both of those things that at once
but I just I remembered that moment when
it was we had shot that all day and then
we come back and we're talking to Jill
on the phone and just asking him to work
with us to make this you know
stop-motion t-shirt war thing and I
don't know that's just the first thing I
thought that that was when you know we
were just we just twist our brains
trying to come up with something that it
reminds me of lot yeah what of what we
consider our Golden Age in that way I
think it's about like just the
possibilities right yeah well and you
know there's a desperation thirsty just
thirsty kids but it's interesting
because and I'm sure you guys have the
same thing but when you have that era
that you kind of look back at well
there's a contingent of fans who look
back at that and just like they always
point to that
and they're like we're like that again
it will never be like well to never be
like that again but I do have this
theory that regardless of where this
goes and what this becomes for any of us
I do think that they'll probably be a
time we may be like I mean links here
well death will be completely white
mine will probably be at least halfway
there I think it stopped I think this is
you have a nice little thing going like
a storm Mystique thing going but I think
there is an appetite for that to do that
again right to be like let's just take a
camera to Alabama and see what happens
and so I do think that it kind of will
come full circle at some point my my
opinion is that whenever you try it it's
never the same it won't be the same and
I tried to like whenever you try to
rebuttal the magic right yeah but I
think that anyone anytime somebody finds
your channel or find something new
that's their golden era right like yeah
yeah back then whatever they fell in
welcome everybody today sri podcast
episode number 50 Wow
halfway to 100 I don't know that most
podcasts would celebrate 50 but it's
been a lot of ups and downs a lot of
bumps a lot of strikes and gutters here
so I think the fact that we made 50 is
worth a golf club I think so and in life
take any chance to celebrate I think
that's a good policy I think that's
encouraging it's a beautiful thing
give yourself small milestones any
chance to celebrate put that on my
tombstone I saw that's just like what I
do is like if I managed to walk a little
bit extra in a day I'm like let's
celebrate with a pizza and that's how
you end up looking like ya - on Thursday

back in let's just get right into this
gals a really long intro if you guys
haven't seen the jacksFilms parody of
led that's what we were fairings going
right great video that was a really
terrific video let's get right back
let's let's get right into it all right
here's the deal of top store we've got a
lot to cover here Logan Paul I haven't
had a chance to talk about the whole
fiasco surrounding Logan Paul's channel
being demonetized
for tasering a dead rat now we don't
have to talk there's a pattern of
behavior here with Logan Paul of playing
with dead dead corpses in adamant once
living things he has sociopathic
behavior it's pretty weird like you
would think that it would be
overthinking every little thing he's
doing right now because everyone is
looking he would be a little sensitive
to tasing dead rats or taking living
fish out of his koi pond and performing
CPR on them as they breathe at they
desperately
gasps freer but nope well this is thing
about Logan is that before the suicide
force thing this is who he was he was a
he was this guy he was desecrating
corpses long before the suicide forest
and YouTube was stroking his [ __ ] like
as you know as if somebody bought his
March or subscribed on Twitch like
that's what I don't like about how you
like before all this they were giving
him YouTube read movies they were giving
him YouTube red shows he was like the
face of YouTube rewind I think YouTube
is getting walk right now
wake the flip up and get go because they
thought of lager is just it's like the
safest content and they probably didn't
even then even more notorious videos
exact figured it's a vlog what could go
exactly a bunch of kids it's just Logan
Paul whatever but this guy yeah they
didn't bother to check out like who is
this guy so they've got the time and
effort the people at face value like
filthy Frank and items and us they're
like keep them in arms like I don't have
anything with them but Logan Paul is
running around desecrating corpses and
they make him the face of YouTube but
sick it's it's so twisted bro and now
all the sudden it's like oh we know
Logan who we never heard of him it's
like no you made him famous you prop
this psychopath up by that merch well
anyway I know it's song he's singing
now that is channel ste monetized you
know so it's a really quick you know we
were talking about before but I don't
think the dead rat part look if a lot of
jackass could have done that people you
met you before filthy frankenz don't
stuff with the animals I think the big
difference here though is that not that
he did that stuff cuz that in the vacuum
is not don't worst thing to do morally
right but the difference is everybody
was looking at him and he got he thought
he could out charm you know doing that
right after the whole corpse Fiasco in
Japan that's the big thing to me it's
not that he I mean the act is bad but
it's not the bigger thing if it is it's
the context of it right it's not that
bad at the fact
you but we doing that right after when
you know everybody's looking at you is
pretty [ __ ] it's pretty nutty to me I
I saw a lot of of people being it's
really the context of how it happened
right there matters well it's just like
will you will you be a little bit weary
of doing anything bad if you just
[ __ ] the show to rigor mortis corpse
behind you I'm feeling loaded
I mean seriously was a decomposing man
and they went you know what I think I
think I think my comeback needs a
beautiful CPR a [ __ ] living koi I
mean ripped out of its pods people were
comparing it to like well we're all
celebrating Logan's channel being
demonetised
but we would have filthy Frank was doing
this a year plus ago and nobody and like
obviously we would be a grief that
happened to him but Tim today so those
people I say it's a different time I
mean we all except now this is not the
YouTube it used to be yeah this is post
this is post that pocalypse world this
is like 911 on YouTube like the rules
are just different
you can't send anthrax to two people in
the mail anymore like he always mailed
his P that's a perfect Joey South was
mailing urine to people that's the kind
of wild-west 9/11 okay we take our shoes
off at checkpoints this is just the new
reality now okay and Lobo Paul not only
knew that he was at the center of it
right and he made this whole Cheney's
cheesy corny PR I'm donating a million
bucks to suicide prevention by the way
worst the receipt on that I'm not
doubting you I'm just saying wait
where's Jordan I want to hear what
Jordan has to say Jordan's a local pawn
fan yeah I'd like to see him to defend
this well he said he was defibrillating
the but like it's a it's a different era
and Logan Paul was at the center of this
I mean he was under a microscope yeah
this is him on good behavior he this is
him on good behavior
yeah I don't have time to go back and
watch all of his videos but he was
probably torturing animals for long
before his parents know he was torturing
animals from a young age and they let
him out into the world
really
anyway let's let's let's take a closer
look
the thing about Logan that really
grinded my gears was he came back after
this break
he made this wonderful PR video about
suicide and stuff but he during that
time he showed absolutely no remorse and
basically spit in the face of YouTube
and and everyone who was criticizing him
with certain things for example let me
show you the first one he went after the
controversy I mean a weeks after it
cardi B posted on Instagram this picture
and she said they're trying to crucify
me like they did Christ okay now what do
you think Logan said in response to that
I think he said that's a bit of an
exaggeration he says give me a break
you'll come on no he says lols you
telling me so in in Logan's mind in the
midst of getting [ __ ] he's being
crucified like Jesus he's dying at the
cross he's the martyr he did nothing
wrong this evil world is the one that
put him up friend for the injustice I
mean this is this is dilution on on the
highest scale and beyond that he's
writing it on cardi B's Instagram like
she's gonna notice it be like oh my god
Logan Paul commented yeah that's not all
folks folks and the facts next up Logan
Paul here
here's his comeback video after the
suicide the suicide meme where you
supposedly by the way if you're gonna
donate a million dollars a guy like
Logan Paul who's all about being flashy
and show off he you think he'd have like
a giant check or something or receiving
be like hey guys here's the I'm not
saying he's a liar but all I'm saying is
where's the proof no no no I think he
claimed but I'm just saying are we
supposed to take this guy
face value that's an incredible claim I
donate a million dollars to suicide
prevention where's that Chad I think
it's worth the waffle to ask for proof
for that I think it's a pretty
reasonable claim I would provide it
because this is the internet everybody's
skeptical I think it's just a missed
opportunity of using one of those big
checks and I mean that's a principle of
life when you get a chance to use a big
check of Caesar for Christ's sake I mean
I I gotta be honest I watch that part so
I don't know what's the what proof did
he provide well no he just said he says
at the end of video I'm from I'm
donating a million dollars to suicide
prevention mm-hmm and then everybody was
like oh my god well if you do do it good
job
yeah yeah but did he receive where that
receipt we're not receipt no but
seriously where that receipt you know
everybody at Logan Paul where that
receipt everybody not please don't it's
too late it's too like that so I mean
just put that on there don't do that
don't don't
whatever you do don't tweet at Logan
Paul where that receipts that would be a
really immature thing to do don't do it
let's go up we're better than that but
if I was a judge and this was hereditary
I would say just show me there was this
was Judge Judy she would say to him
Logan Paul versus the court of public
opinion Judge Judy would say Logan let
me see the receipts yeah Julianne
executional you would say provide me
some receipts if you were judge dredd if
I could say a big claim that he wouldn't
even try to fake it I'm pretty sure he
did it I don't see I know there's a
chance he there but I don't think so
you're saying there's a chance
all right let's move on but but
seriously where the receipt hashtag
let's get that treasure so anyway here
so after the whole where's the receipt
scandal the non-existent scandal so this
was his his comeback Logan powers back
there's a lot of conceit a lot of
arrogance a lot of self congratulatory
dick is broken where chaos hides in the
shadows
dictated by pure and absolute savagery
one absolutely one boy
I noticed he always does this where he's
like I'm not a man I'm a boy I'm a boy
from Ohio I'm just yeah you I can't be
held responsible for anything I'm a 22
year old boy you're a [ __ ] fully
grown man they have a lot of
responsibility you're not a boy why like
you have this whole ego thing and you
prefer to be called a boy I think I
think it's to say that I'm so young yeah
they're so so successful I think that's
the point of it it's only 22 of them
humblebrag
I guess you're right everything
everything seems to be carefully
manicured manicured to stroke his gentle
you go not gentle but really not gentle
actually questioning something I've been
questioning his age for a long time just
like he's 62
where's the [ __ ] where's the
emergency serious what the log sir I
love that I love it the birth
certificates not enough money
legend
no I'm Logan
Jake is my brother I'm looking for oh
snap
okay okay a little bit of a goof how
would you rate that mr. hilarious yeah
is there a fart or [ __ ] sound effect on
this thing dad is there an ass farting
really create an ass for new [ __ ] so
defect on this so I can write that yeah
that rap for you the idea that that mr.
Hill attack mr. hilarious will be a
continuous presence here on the sound
board on commentary so we got to make
sure he gets everything he needs den
yeah I need to be alright so anyway so
you rate that a fart noise yeah you know
there's something really christ-like
about that video like he's got this long
beard he's gets like it's like Christ
died he's kind of rising from the dead
he literally commented that on cardi B I
think that's attention I think it's very
a christ-like symbolism so it's coming
to a it's coming to a head here soon the
Maverick Logan Paul
showing his face for the first time
after the disgraced youtuber has been
spotted
[Music]
he's like did you guys notice my apology
had 50 million views and paparazzi were
taking my pictures all the time like I'm
not gonna say that yeah I messed up but
did you see how much publicity I got out
of it did you see that I managed to fake
cry Hollywood what did they say
you look sincere but it it gonna have
the feeling that you're just a good at
what what's that saying I don't know
what you're referring to you know what
I'm not gonna try it out this is your
own hour can take a three week break hey
a million so yeah so he put the humility
thing to this at the side really quick
who else can get a million subscribers
and I didn't get I'm not disgraced I
took a break I just wanted a little
break after my vacation to Japan wasn't
really related to anything I just wanted
to relax a little bit because I work
really hard not related to the
desecration of corpses by the way is
there any corpses around because I'm
gonna do you mind if I rub my dick on
some dead creatures [ __ ] that koi it's
disgusting
deep fake this is the vibe like I'm
following all this and I'm I'm upset
because I'm like this guy doesn't give a
crap
he doesn't care and he's just this kind
of behavior of just he's like deflecting
all the blame I he's been crucified like
Jesus and his mind and it's just he spit
he the PR thing was just so transparent
at this point and he's just such a
[ __ ] here look at this from Twitter
the evidence mounts still come on guys
we got this there was a petition to
delete his channel which is obviously a
lot of people venting their frustration
about how messed up the thing is
it had over a half a million sub sub my
signature signature now here he is uh
you know essentially saying that I think
they're all handicapped
well he's acting like he's got a little
you know his eyes are a little goofy he
thinks they're [ __ ] he thinks there
was no I think that he can like make fun
of it and he's like [ __ ] that's what
he's saying am I wrong in saying that he
was calling people yeah I don't see that
but I do see that he's trying to make it
seem like you can just joke about it you
know what I mean
come on guys we got this but essentially
not taking anything seriously deflecting
all the blame and being a little bit of
a [ __ ] and not really changing so
there's this mounting evidence Exhibit C
and then we've got more in case you
needed more reasons to hate Logan Paul
he made a video this one really tickles
my berries
unbeliev that's an expression he made a
video where he dresses up and asks
college students what they think about
Logan Paul do you guys notice anything
weird about the background he used the
thumbnail that picture of his face when
he's right in front of the corpse he
used that to clickbait his new video in
the background click baiting himself
let's make John suicide forest video
thumbnail the he chose after all this
[ __ ] it's completely my finding
absolutely mind-bending and there's more
still my god here we go let's open this
up so he's asking these guys do you know
Logan pause a lot of them are like no I
don't you can tell he's like pretty
messed up right pretty insensitive right
from what we see like that was not a
good I don't personally that's a fact an
actual factual verifiable thing I mean I
didn't watch the whole thing but I know
like a lot of other like influencers
were talking about it yeah I was just
respectful but the same time intention
really it was taken way out of
proportion so you don't think we should
throw him off a building no of course
not that's like totally hypocritical but
Penny's about that Logan :
we found someone who supports me I love
this one okay respect speaking of people
that people don't like how about that
Logan Paul character no you need that
suicide forest video pretty messed up
right pretty insensitive right I don't
know dude I just like the Logan's like
luckily I do usually get pretty
insensitive he was behind for the corpse
[Laughter]
and then it's like way are you Logan
Paul this is stranger you should be the
thing that's weird is you should be
distancing yourself it's time to move
past this and he's trying he's trying
he's not like trying to me me he's
trying to capitalize on it and clickbait
himself in the tongue this video has 10
million views he clicked baited himself
in the thumbnail in front of the corpse
and he's like capitalizing on it it's
just bizarre man so here guys let's
watch the logan paul taste some dead
rats
[Applause]
you can see how disturbed his problem
not something like a bad idea coming off
of the writers and at the very least
edited out and post like do it on the
spot you're a little crazy you're a
little wild embracing being like the bad
boy anything so you can make it cool you
know the 50s guys would have like
leather jackets and motorcycles so this
is the bad boy now you got a Taser dead
rat screaming the microphone the neuera
bad boy
the memories oh he's so dreamy he chases

extra episode this Tuesday top of the
bud joining us on the mic and sound war
will be the funny and wonderful good
friend of mine Zak Adel aka psychic
pebbles it's gonna be a magical mystery
ride so join us on Tuesday but enough
with that peripheral BS because today's
guest is perhaps the most underrated
youtuber of all time for sure of all
time his production quality is beyond
anything I've ever seen on YouTube and
every video has the production quality
and visual effects of like a
multi-million dollar Hollywood
production it's insane
he's been doing it for 10 years and he's
in my he's one of my favorite channels
and he's criminally under watched you
may know him as Captain disillusion he's
a superhero whose special power is
skepticism he debunks conspiracy
theories and faked special effects in a
wonderful comedic way that I have not
seen anywhere he is the incredible Randi
of the new generation I cannot sing his
praises enough and it is a great honor
and privilege to introduce the wonderful
Allen Melek Jane Ian to the show and
also Allen and viewers at home did you
realize that we're on a green screen
this whole time Oh who's the special
effects master now dude green-screen
ourselves into our own studio please
who's on that level I know how to drag
and drop ultra keys alright with that
being said I hope you all just got
freaked out
let's get wrong with our boy Allen got
him what did you think about that how
what do you think about our special
effects you know what [ __ ] this [ __ ] Wow
okay that's what happens when you out
dock they don't know what you think
you're so smart but actually he's called
the amazing Randi all right so you got
that wrong incredible Randi
I'm sure he'll take incredible thank you
so much for being here god bless ya
great to see you thank you for having me
hi I think hi and everybody who's ever
seen your videos has got to be a huge
fan thank you so I it's great that we
finally get a chance to say what up I'm
so happy to be here I should warn you
guys though
that uh the the the first the only other
time I've been to LA before now has been
for like work reasons with this company
that I've been years ago
and we came here to get like an
endorsement from a famous person and our
experience was we came to LAX landed
went straight to Beverly Hills to meet
in the home of this like well-known film
director who was in our meeting but I'll
say another name though because during
the meeting which went fine it had to be
paused for a minute because he was
visited by rock musician guitarist Slash
which just showed up with a DVD of a
cartoon that he produced or something
that starts like a kid version of
himself that he wanted to show the
director so they watched it in his
bedroom like sitting on the bed yeah and
we're there watching them watch this
like a couple of kids and then you know
he they finished he left
we finished our meeting went back on the
plane so I'm just saying the level of
weirdness has to be maintained this trip
like if you guys can help me out so I
have a story each time is not an
uncommon experience no no he's a strange
city it's way too big
hmm there's everybody takes freeways
that are like you can't see anything
when you're on the freeway so you have
no grasp of what the city is actually
like a lot of people come here for
business
they just their experience is being
stuck in traffic all day and then they
leave they're like what's the yeah what
did I like it it's just you got a
you got it good understand like ten
years here be like yeah I'm gonna fall
in love with it yeah over time I get it
and I know it's not that romantic it's
not like I think you succeed here fall
in love yeah that's how it works
maybe my first question for you is how
long does it take to do that makeup used
to take a really long time like I was so
slow and bad at it it took me like maybe
like 45 minutes like it shouldn't look
like it takes that long but I got it
down to about 15-20 minutes when I'm
like just breezing through it that's
still it's it's a process and I imagine
like how many shoot days do you have per
visit I try to keep it to one for that
very reason but sometimes yeah we'll
have like a proper like movie shoot day
where it's like an 8 to 12 hour day
we're just like let's get because I do
12 takes of everything and I can't
really talk good so yeah we'll just
shoot everything through but sometimes
if it involves me like being in a
different location or something outside
the place so we'll we'll do like a
separate day so there's a lot of
planning that goes in through the script
probably because it's gotta be all right
I mean I treat treated like short films
you know like we do and I went to film
school we did little films all the time
and it's the whole I do everything by
the book that way I write the script
I'll plan it out do a shot list and Wow
do it in the nerdy way so when you say
well here I want I want to I would like
to for the uninitiated here in the
audience watch one of your videos I want
to just give the people out there who
aren't familiar with your work some is
that okay oh yeah I hope it's not one of
the old ones that I know I want to watch
your first video is like what the hell
like your first videos from ten years
ago and aren't all the other bought
videos at that time I bought a square
yeah mine's a square technically but
it's like letterbox to be 16 and now it
looks normal
yeah at a time you are I had to add a
special tag because it was like you know
how that the thing that happened where
like you had the widescreen video and if
you got boxed in twice right so there's
like a little tag they made you could
put it in and it's like
ahead of the freaking game even ten
years ago so okay I want people to get
the full D the big ol D that they
deserve no quick T's here
big fat D so here is your I think this
is your most recent video yeah you made
you you at home may no have heard of the
invisible box challenge I happen upon it
and basically what you do generally
speaking is fine online phenomenons or
how would you call it people who are
trying to get away the something yeah I
mean just hoaxes and a little depends
sometimes it could just be something
unusual and you can't tell if it's real
or fake or someone really deliberately
deliberately trying to like fool people
it's different thing or sometimes it's
just a viral ad right so you debunk
stuff videos essentially graphical
effects mainly yeah I like I just call
it debunking for ease of like
understanding but sometimes I'll just
like kind of critique a thing or say hey
here's how you could do this you know
and this is how they did it this is how
you could do it sometimes I'm really
pissed off and I think what they're
doing is wrong and I kind of really
criticized the people behind it
sometimes I'm having fun with it
when you say are you talking about the
character or yeah how what's the
difference between what you feel and
what the character feels I mean it's
like a heightened exaggerated version of
like my impulsive reactions to what I
see but of course it's made you know I
like to think I'm a nice guy this is
like how I wish like the dickish version
of me that I wish I could be and I think
it works just for comedic effect
sometimes it's like almost what not to
be
like how not to react it's you know it's
like a reverse like I love it I think I
think it's so funny I love the character
well here let's watch this first of all
let me say I love how you just flex on
all the people in this video because
you're like you guys were all doing this
fake box challenge but if you were good
this is how you would do it basically
let's watch
I think we should just go ahead and
pronounce the word meme the way we all
read it in our heads
I admit something embarrassing yeah
you're like my first two years on the
internet I said I said Mamie yeah me too
why I didn't talk on the internet but
that's how I thought it's pronounced how
would you how are you supposed to know
you were in is what you're supposed to
yeah you're supposed to hear the
audiobook of the Richard Dawkins book he
says no but I was I was chastised by my
friends because I was walking around
saying Mamie that's so embarrassing but
I was there like it's me Mom I should
bring it back yeah I mean it's more fun
to say little circle yeah the dank
maymay well you guys are trendsetters
now you could do this you brought it
back you're the main main guy it's a
perfect still there meme already means
mime in French so the viral trend we
call that should at least involve some
actual miming skills like for instance
the invisible box challenge you know the
thing that was a thing for a while where
you try to convincingly step over
nothing it truly took off when someone
actually managed to do it well was that
one fake no no that's that's okay that's
the one I saw like that's cool I mean
none of them are fake I mean there are a
few the ones that are highlight you know
yeah and it kind of came later the
phenomenon of faking it because people
wanted to one-up each other but first
people were just trying to do this dance
move which I guess she does the best do
it well and that someone was see your
Texas varsity cheerleader Arielle Olive
are here she is on NBC's Today Show
explaining how to perform the move in a
series of shots that break every
possible rule of composition let's watch
okay first you to show them as nothing
there
like a magic trick and then you lift
your leg or no you have to pass I
thought you were gonna do bunk this
place turns out you just didn't like the
well behind the scenes extra here you
see they have a little green screen
thing going on in that show because
later they do a joke of it the hosts
join her and they do it anyone can do it
well anyone who is strong lightweight
and extremely coordinated like Ariel and
me watch this your green screen setup
yeah well I made this like rigged up to
look sadder and fall it's incredible
what you can accomplish with relatively
small resources sure just gotta know how
to make it look good and notice the
green shirt on green green screen that
was not easy
what you mean green yeah before before
the green screen disappears it's
actually being keyed you gotta have the
skills understand exactly what I'm
looking at here like I'm wearing that
green shirt there everyone what is being
keyed on green screen for that little
bit and that's just you know that's just
how you just experience that skills
right oh my god Dan well how do you feel
about that are you insecure back there a
little bit we were struggling we were
struggling keying out that perfectly lit
professionally setup look good to me is
that it is that a good conditions for a
greener for a green yeah yeah we can't
really we can't really good
another part that I love the view in
door types how about this when you start
flexing on these haters and show how it
could really be done feel like much of a
challenge how about this my totally fake
invisible box video breaks all those
rules
the camera is handheld and moving a
clear shadow shows my foot not touching
anything and this alternate angle shows
I wasn't suspended from above
can you tell how I did it so when you
all reveal so great so how long did it
take you to actually as you go into the
details of how you did it and putting
dots on the concrete
okay after finding just the right
location completely and I filmed the
shot with a real box dotted with
tracking markers I also put a dense grid
of markers on the ground in front of the
box like all these markers help me
extract a camera salt and refill all the
dots in the back you set up like though
the back are just just features that are
dot looking but mainly what was
important is that area move in 3d much
more precisely than could be done with
auto tracking armed with this 3d
animated recreation I was able to freeze
one frame of the pavement without the
box which I made sure to capture right
after filming the move and projected
back on to the virtual ground surface
making the box literally invisible
throughout the moving shot forced it
also made everything else that entered
the area disappear and while the green
on the Box helped a little I ended up
manually rotoscoping my hand and foot
and their respective shadows to appear
on top of the box and visibility patch
ironically the biggest challenge was
removing the markers that made the
effect possible in the first place
painting them away in one frame and
using the same projection method as the
box wasn't enough because my shadow
moved across them so I picked individual
frames where various markers are in
shadow painted each one
and combined a series of projections
until I had a version of the entire grid
in shadow I then used the tracking data
to stabilize a 2d projection of my
shadow and rotoscope did to create a mat
that controlled when and how a shadow
moonwalkers revealed after SIA final
tweaks and color adjustments I ended up
with a pretty convincing take on a meme
that was already extremely out of date
when I started being trans out a couple
questions that was so great yeah that
was actually one of my favorite moments
from from your videos of how about that
whole sequence came together how long
did it did it take you to put all that
together well I I mean I take I release
a video a month and so you know that the
old like adage they a task is going to
take as long as the time you a lot for
it so it pretty much takes me every day
of the month to put it together but like
the effects are definitely the longest
portion because I'll shoot it in a day
like I said I'll do like the rough
editing in a day and then I just sit
there for days doing moving the fine
work so you you you spend the bulk of
your time doing all the visual effects
do you do you edit yourself yeah I
everything every like moment of every
video I've done on my own you know if I
was smart I could like collaborate with
people and get people to help me but you
know I'm still working on that I'm
figuring out how I can I can make that
someone on that level which could you
ever trust somebody else that edit ear
style just you just have to know how to
meet the right people and like you know
kind of find like minds and people of
the same skill level but I'm not like
you know what's funny as we were
watching that I wanted to say that yeah
it looks it's pretty dense and I'm
explaining a lot of stuff but honestly
like anyone that does visual effects
when they watch that they'll be like
yeah sure like that's what we do
nothing's what we do every day huh I
mean it's it's just that kind of
complicated like it's it's yeah but you
know it's funny well before I knew how
to edit I used to watch these like MLG
montages and I was like that's magic
it's like just really shitty meme
it's hunger but now that I see that it
looks really easy yeah but I'm
interested what you said about how it
takes you so long to make a video it's
so hard for you your video to be
relevant by the time you finish it do
you find yourself coming along that
problem frequently yeah I mean you know
that like YouTube move so fast is that
you're trying to hit on something trendy
so I'm I've learned that I just that's
not something I'm always able to do so
I'm like aiming for things either like
this I'll just play it off and say well
now it's my turn to talk about this or
I'll just pick things that are kind of
timeless like a lot of viral videos just
come around like you just come back then
they do like they're like a comment I
had an episode called viral comments
where it's just like stuff somebody just
starts sharing the thing from 2002 again
and it's like how did you tell me about
your background of visual effects and
special effects you studied it in
college but how did how did you actually
get good I didn't actually study visual
effects in college right I always was
interested in like moviemaking and
animation and it was always a toss-up
for me between which of those two fields
I'm really going to pursue and when it
was time to go to college
I picked this like kind of little like
dingy little film school that was just
starting out and and they had a computer
animation program that was all fancy and
this little like trihard little film
Department and then I signed up for
animation but at the last second like
after the first day of school I realized
I need to change my major because
animation and anything with visual
effects with computers that's something
you can learn on your own
honestly like there's especially now
this this was before like tutorials and
things but there were books on the
subjects and you could you could just
get the software and figure it out and
play with it until you figure out how it
works but with filmmaking shooting stuff
editing you've got a it's like a team
sport and if you don't learn in like a
safe way how to work together with
everybody how to delegate and everything
then you there's no and also like play
with all the fancy equipment that you
don't necessarily need
just can't get tons of money yeah so I
said yeah I spent like I studied that
properly and then I kind of just taught
self-taught in terms of effects in it
well so people who want to learn how to
do this or learn to make film is that
the important thing that you learned
from film school more than anything just
how to work in that that team
environment would you say yeah well like
specifically just things not with not
having to do with effects just making
movies telling stories that's something
it's difficult to do on your own you can
watch a YouTube tutorial about how to
work with a group it's not you can even
watch that tutorial but you without
experiencing it and like interacting and
getting a thing done together I don't
think you can you know you it's like you
just have to feel it out but a computer
program is a computer program like we
use them every day so this is just a
different thing you do that with a
different tool I wanted to ask you kind
of answered it is it possible to learn
to be that good at editing in school or
do you think someone who's who's as
talented as you at it see you grimacing
I don't take compliments well do you
think that someone can get that good at
something would have to just on their
own decide and dedicate I'm gonna spend
an obscene amount of time by myself
welcome back to a free podcast live
every Friday except when it's not Friday
it's not at 3:00 at twitch.tv 4/8
reproductions today's guest is the
biggest name in YouTube's tech reviews
with nearly 6 million subs he's the guy
I always go to when I want tech info
that's real weather smart phones cars
laptops cameras this guy covers it I
feel like I'm doing a copy / h-34 temper
self no he is the excellent and
wonderful Marquis they say right Marcus
Marcus I don't say my name much in the
actual videos right one usually knows it
but yeah Marquez Marquez Brownlee thank
you for joining us appreciate it thank
you it's 7 p.m. currently if we're gonna
watch it on YouTube so you came out here
at the end of a long day spend time with
us but I appreciate what do you been up
to today today and most of this week has
been we're shooting a video on Tesla
Model 3 so I see yeah so we had a lot of
game planning it takes a lot to shoot a
car video because the car you know the
car is driving but then you need a
person outside the car sharing the car
as its driving it's a whole thing
it takes a lot make it look natural yeah
and it's gonna take a lot more in that
ending process but I have faith in it
but that was a lot of today was like
getting like some filling shots of
things that I think will help it flow
well right up until the Sun was going
down and then just came over here was
that the purpose for you coming out to
LA that was the main yeah
the main reason for the trip well for
those who listen the podcast know that
I'm a little bit of a Elon Musk fanboy I
put his dick in my mouth regularly and I
see how deeper I can get it yeah are you
uh are you a fan boy I'd say I'm a Tesla
fanboy for sure not at you want fanboy
well I can't bet against Elon yeah I
mean I'm saying boy I guess cuz I I
follow most of what he does
I fought yeah well okay let me start
here what did you think of the model 3
okay so model I own a Model S so that's
my comparison point for a lot of stuff
very similar which is good because when
you're buying a car you want it to live
up to maybe a higher car on the same
year so it felt familiar it's pretty
quick it's electric it's got a front
still all the same stuff were used to
but there's definitely some weird quirks
that I'll talk about in that full video
but like I think the main thing people
are concerned about is the screen there
are zero buttons in the car the only one
that that is in the car is required by
law is the hazards button up in the
corner but if everything is just on this
one screen in the middle including your
speed your gear is really it's just it's
unusual it's a weird setup yeah but uh
they did that because it's it's
self-driving and eventually you won't
really have to worry about that too much
but when you're driving you kind of have
this trained glance down to the side of
like instead of looking right down at
the speed you look kind of to the side
at your speed it's a little different
you know I I have a Model S yeah and one
thing it's it is bleeding edge because
sometimes I love that car of most days
but sometimes I hate it like through
that day the screen wouldn't turn on
like it just I go in and it doesn't so
that's how that I've had to be like
really late to turn on but it's never
just not turned he could still drive
yeah I was able to drive I didn't know
that but like that concerns me even more
in the model 3 when they're like oh
they're gonna be a little too edgy and
put it all on a screen and then all of a
sudden when you're counting too much on
that screen what I mean it doesn't start
yeah yeah there's a lot of edge cases
where like you got to wonder like is it
failsafe is it kind of work if the
screen doesn't work right yeah well you
I remember you had a huge issue with
your got it
what happened probably a worse problem
oh wait almost made me not want to buy
it I was before you it was a huge life
decision buying a Tesla cos I mean it's
an expensive car right but for me it was
more as much I won't say more about as
much about supporting the mission
statement of supporting e.v.p.s right
but your video made me think twice about
it more than anything else tell tell the
audience what happened to you okay so it
was a essentially it all came down to
the power steering obviously power
steering is this mechanical loads flew
and McCann I don't know how to describe
it exactly but it helps you steer the
car based on the weight of it so you can
change the steering weight you can have
a sporty or comfort steering all that
stuff but when the power steering fails
it's extremely hard to turn the wheel
any direction because the car is super
heavy so what I had was I was driving I
went to go turn left across traffic and
midway through my turn as the wheels
turned like 45 degrees the power
steering cut that's and I was cutting
across traffic unable to move the car
Wow this happened once got it like I
like it snapped back into working again
I finished my drive pulled over you know
got it towed got it fixed they replaced
the entire steering rack I was like
alright that's definitely fixed for sure
then a couple hundred miles later it
happened again Wow and that's dangerous
that was dangerous and the second time I
think was more dangerous the first two
times were in the same ride where I like
I was making a left turn but it wasn't a
big deal if I couldn't the second time
was like two cars next to each other
both making the LAV right and I was the
inside car oh no and so when it failed
if that guy had also made the left I
would have just t-boned him but he went
straight yeah so that was like a I
immediately pulled over that's a red
flag obviously whenever you have the
same issue more than once they escalate
your issue to like definitely solve it
because three in New Jersey is lemon law
you can give the car back for free Oh
interesting
yeah so they flout an engineer from here
basically had him diagnose the problem
and they found a corrosive element in
the wiring between the power steering
rack and some other part of the car so
they flew someone to they flew someone
out yeah to to check out my car that
took a couple extra days the first time
it was like one day we replaced that
you're good this time it was like
alright we'll fly someone out a couple
days later they found out what was wrong
they flew out the parts they needed to
fix it it was a whole thing for maybe
like a week and a half that they gave me
a loaner p100 D during those days when I
didn't have my car which was pretty dope
a nice service yeah
they owe one hand it's nice service by
the other hand they could have
you better have it serviced yes so yeah
they fix that and they pretty much
guaranteed it will never fail in that
exact way again if it does it's a lemon
but they say so since then no issues are
you paranoid at all making those left
curse do you still think about those
left turns no dude I'm I don't want to
say reckless but I'm very confident yeah
that sounds like I don't have the P 100d
that once insane but we both drove it
I've driven it because that we tested
and they gave us a loaner p100 ooh and
so in the few 100 d which is the highest
level model and the only difference
between the P 100 D and the step-down
which is like the 90 D or I guess it's
the one Hyundai now we got our we're
straight I can i've memorize the line
but at any rate the only difference is
the acceleration for example the one
below it goes 0 to 60 and 4.3 seconds
right or 4.2 I think now the p100 d does
it and 2.4 yeah it's a significant now
when I got that loaner car I put it in
ludicrous mode you have to be that's
like a contract saying that ok now when
you click this button and you and your
crash fatally you click the button just
let the world know you decided to do
this yeah it's it's ungodly and when I
it when I drove it my first thought was
like this is not safe this is not safe
at all yeah it's when you have that kind
of acceleration as personally not just 0
to 60 but like 30 to 80 right or like
for me it's all about the 0 to 30 in the
Tesla yeah I mean from zero the only
weird stuff you're doing is like at
stoplights or maybe someone pulls up
next to you and like wants to race which
doesn't really ever happen but like
you're on the highway and someone's you
know there's a gap and you need to get
to the exit do you slow it down and go
behind him or do you accelerate and go
in front of that car you see nine times
out of 99 you're going up and taking the
Front's it actually feels much safer cuz
we also have a Prius which was our
previous car yeah
and I still drive that one sometimes and
I feel less safe it's strange but I I
feel like I have more control over the
car that's what it comes down to so
technically and also this this has
happened before the car will if it sees
an impending collision right will try to
avoid it
someone soars into your lane it'll
swerve a little bit away I have an
experience and if it sees someone coming
up behind you about to rear-end you
really by itself it'll just kind of Juke
you forward a little bit that is to
avoid it and that's that's happened to
me in my car and that's definitely it
gave you a little boost yeah I thought
it was broken
now we're gonna round the same time and
it jeopardized your ass exactly it's a
wash exactly so tell me um you said you
were in the model three and it's a lot
like the Model S in your opinion do you
think the model 3 is a Model S killer
because the price is like the price is a
huge difference he's so like 40,000
bucks I think the fact the price
difference is so big is actually what
keeps it from being a Model S killer I
think there's gonna be people who are in
the market for a fifty sixty to seventy
thousand dollar car that aren't gonna
pick model three because of lower price
there and they want premium R and Model
S is always gonna be that I think it's
getting a refresh remembered in the next
year or two to update it with a lot of
the things that model three is currently
better at but I think because the price
difference is so big people who were
waiting to buy a Tesla until it was 35
grand are now gonna buy that not a model
so you think just the status symbol
alone is enough to to keep it alive yeah
I think it's just gonna basically having
at that lower price it's just gonna open
doors for way more people to buy it well
I hope that they do distinguish the
difference because yeah they try they're
pretty clear in their messaging I think
internally they have a lot of they're
trying to make sure people know Model S
is still the better car yeah doesn't say
yeah that there there's features and
things you I mean there's two two
screens instead of one like if you look
at model three oh this is the future
just one screen but like roadster is
gonna have to like their their higher
end stuff is still gonna have two
machines and two because they can afford
it I think they wanted they may have
wanted to do a heads-up display
like you know maybe having the the speed
on the like the windshield or something
like that all kinds of interesting
things that they couldn't do because of
the lower price right that they do in
the Model S right do you think that
Tesla is will be able to achieve all of
its goals I mean the the goals of the
company is is huge
and there's a lot of doubters and
naysayers of what Tesla is doing and and
to be frank they haven't been off to a
great start with their Model 3 launch
yet what they ended up making like 4,000
when they had promised to make like
50,000 they're way way way way behind do
you see them succeeding and what they're
setting out to do I I'm always hesitant
about the timelines they give sure
because they're Elon and that whole crew
is always super ambitious about like
yeah we'll do this and this year and
like the Roadster is the same thing 2020
yeah right like that's gonna be at least
a couple years after that I think but I
think the actual goals are setting
they're eventually hitting them when
people are saying like they're weren't
gonna hit him at all yeah so stuff like
production of Model S which has been
ramping up kind of the same way like
model threes at the beginning of that
climb sure and they kind of mapped out
that climb with Model S and I think they
sold their two hundred thousandth Model
S last year which people never thought
they would defer so you know it might
not be the same people call it Elon time
right yeah as literally it goes all the
way down to like the time of the event
like he'll kill get on stage of five
o'clock and they it's 503 and we're like
yeah maybe so timelines not so much but
I think they eventually they'll get
there yeah interesting I hope so
I think there's so much demand for the
Model 3 a fully electric it's a great
great car and the 100 something thousand
orders already four hundred actually
sell it I feel like the demand is
infinite if he can actually meet the
production yeah before other companies
do because everybody's he kind of opened
the floodgates in terms of it's a weird
thing I
I've been looking more into car stuff
since I started doing these car videos
and like other companies are like
thinking about getting into electric and
they're like promising they're gonna do
it sometime right but I don't see it yet
and that's weird to me that these like
hundred-year-old companies
I mean I guess they're just kind of a
huge yes and they can't be as agile yeah
they're behind it's it's insane say what
you will about Yonkers there's a lot of
people that dislike him and I think it's
just a lot of contrarians who are like
all these people loved him so I'm gonna
hate him that's a whole nother thing
[ __ ] those people but seriously I don't
like what the hell was I saying
say what you will about you learn but
that guy is so infinitely far ahead of
the game like legit paradigm shift so in
the automotive field yeah the
infrastructure I think they're onto
something there obviously the whole
electric car thing they're stupid far
ahead on like right even if like Porsche
tomorrow came out with a $70,000
electric car that does everything Model
S does they don't have the super
charging that they don't have you know
the the autonomous driving they don't
have like seven or eight also massive
projects right that this one car does so
like yeah they're really far ahead it's
unbelievable I mean it's unbelievable
and like like you said at the beginning
everyone thought it was a fantasy and a
joke and it wasn't reasonable but now if
you when you drive around LA I don't
know what it's like Jersey but like
Tesla's are dime-a-dozen here yes so I
noticed that I noticed that about 3 out
of every 10 cars is a Prius yes yeah and
then one out of every 10 is a Model S
and the new everything else in New
Jersey still a lot of Prius is not a lot
of Tesla's but you still kind of start
to see him more mm-hmm my car was the
first the first P 100 D on the East
Coast accordant but yeah you see a Model
S or Model X once in a while but it
still isn't common on the East Coast and
the same thing with supercharger here
it's great thing there's just in
California in LA it's like a combination
of a lot of wealth with people who are
environmentally conscious I think that's
what I noticed also about shooting Model
Model 3 now model 3 is that Unicorn that
people haven't seen on the road
first I hadn't ever seen one what I saw
it at the event but I hadn't seen one on
the road since then when I got here
walking from the hotel to in-and-out I
saw the first one that I ever saw on the
road and then so like you know we got
the car and we're driving it around and
like you're at a supercharged it's like
there's like Tesla enthusiasts just kind
of like around and all their heads are
just kind of like yo what is is that the
model 3 yeah I weren't sure that is
that's the one like we want to know like
what's the price of it what are the
options on it like all the questions
come out as they'd heard about it but
they hadn't seen it you know who got him
all three Jake right he must have been
super early
yeah like day of order maybe did you
order a model 3 I didn't hmm I I would
love to but I think I'm just with ya if
I ever have two cars it would be
roadster a Model S I think so that's
another thing I want to say you so Tesla
came out with another car that you can
pre-order yeah the Roadster so that's P
100 D isn't unsafe enough they're like
here's a car that's even better at yeah
possibly killing yourself yep which is
the Roadster and and it takes a $50,000
deposit right which you which I you have
to pick to EWTN's curve yes and boy yeah
man
so the specs like again that's like a
it's more of a projection than an actual
product at the store it doesn't exist
yeah like they drive the one on stage
but that's not like the finished product
yeah but they gave numbers like oh yeah
it'll go 250 miles an hour and it'll do
0 to 60 in 1.9 seconds
two hundred kilowatt hour battery but
like none of that is physically possible
yeah nine that's gotta be one of the
fastest cars on the road I mean what's
better than that that would be the
fastest production car ever by like 20%
if you do get that car please drive very
safely because that is yes that is very
dangerous that is not so I have a lot of
I'll definitely do a video if it's just
like a bring all I'll have you guys like
sit in the passenger seat and like I
think that's gonna be hilarious but uh
yeah I'm
have to holster some some crazy moves
you really didn't that car is gonna be
sick what's the price tag on in the mold
price tag so there's the the base the
base model why even have a baseball at
that point the weird thing is the base
model does 0-60 in 1.9 and he didn't say
what the optioned up version will them
options just like a static just put
swings right on the side just flies over
traffic yeah it's so that yeah it's
50/50 grand deposit and then 150 grand
at the delivery for the base model and
then there's the founders it probably
sounds weird to say this but that seems
like a reasonable price for what you get
uh yeah when you compare it on paper to
other stories that everyone else oh well
it merely keeps up with a Bugatti but a
Bugatti is two million dollars for
Bugatti about it the fastest 0-60 that
was pretty soft
um the fastest here is six is if you
look it up on Wikipedia it's like the
Porsche 918 spyder the laferrari at the
Bugatti all those cars are 1.8 million
dollars plus right so you dollar car so
if you're competing that's the end
that's the thing is like people will
compare it against that like well you
know it'll catch it in like the quarter
mile sure well no this one holds it up
in a point eight seconds like oh well at
least you have a trunk in this one well
this one also has a trunk like every
time you try to compare it to the best
car and some other let's see if we can
do it I'm excited I'm it's not
everything they showed on stage is still
great it's alright it's about time for
our first commercial break guys we have
got so much more jerking off to do about

Jack's the film's Cheers Jack's not your
real name
jack is not my real name it's John how
did is Jack a name or is it just
completely an alias so Jack is just a
sumed nickname of John so like you know
really John F Kennedy he was he people
knew him as Jack would make that much
sense to me because it's like you know
it's not it's not like a nickname like
you're not shortening anything or like
it's just the letter the first letter is
the same it doesn't make any logical
sense but hey John oh you have to name
John my legal items John Douglas but

anyways everybody hope you all have you
know I feel like we're one of the same
person wherever it is that I am you're
included right so Eric brought this by
the way and he said it was quite bad was
a matter strange I never said it was
good okay for the record yeah so solid
start it's definitely a cringe pretty
hard hmm
that's a sipper that it's not a
chocolate zipper it's perfume yeah I'll
say it's bad gross really I don't mind
it
that's some cold weather but it comes
from Norway that's when it's like dark
for a week straight and you're like it
just kills me Oh like one of those real
northern uh yeah absolutely it's gotta
sting that's on the bottle I think so
how you guys been talk to me what have
you been up to Jack oh boy
so I had a nice little Christmas New
Year's holiday break back in the East
Coast just kind of ping ponged
everywhere from Maryland New Jersey to
Pennsylvania to DC pleasure
traveling like so Oh always for pleasure
yes absolutely yeah it's my king yeah
but yeah just strictly like just a nice
last week and then I had another kind of
like vacation from because normally I'm
always posting videos like always always
always it never stops and it kind of
drives me insane yeah you were very very
active my friends well and it's not a
good thing I need to take a break so I
cut it I had an accidental break where I
went to CES in Vegas last week the baby
yeah it was actually awesome I was there
to meet with brands have meetings blah
blah blah but it was my first CES show
that I've been to I've never like I've
read on this read about this Expo for a
decade but I never been to one so that
was really cool to go to and originally
I was gonna still like upload three
videos that week I ended up not at all
and it was a really nice break I needed
it like for my sanity like as you guys
know you need to do that everything I
was a total happiness to its total
accident but boy oh boy did I need it so
I was like cherished I do I really
really do that's good so so that was my
break ideas down you keep like good
Google
no I have a I have one of those phones
with the styluses so I think I write I
write everything down I love doing I
might not lose that thing that's what
I've always wondered
it's a notepad it goes in the phone and
I don't lose yeah it beeps if you leave
it happen to me yeah so let me just if I
leave it here let me walk I'm gonna walk
it to you okay let's get it yeah lock
the door when he's done I'm gonna take
the stylus I can leave this here so you
can hear it otherwise won't hear it okay
that's smart
so we'll just sit quietly yeah and wait
for the beep so we'll see you later Dan
get him a new world would you first of
all I want to ask you Eric you didn't
drive here drunk did you yeah driving
drunk I'm not gonna sit here quite an
mmm-hmm Wow that phone is a save the
dead mother Mays lost your stylus man
that really is that was so disappointing
I was so excited to like show off this
cool like lost and found feature and oh
well clearly you are very responsible
phone owner you have carried that around
with you and keep the pen I'm very proud
I wanted to look briefly I wanted to ask
you something jack cuz I was pretty
impressed with with this video here it's
quite long okay yes
thank you very much it was really
excellent as you can tell that's where
all my time with actually yes in your
dragon there you go that's son of a can
you touch me through the process of
putting this together it's actually not
as hard I just I want to make sure that
people could enjoy yeah I'll wait so
putting that together really is not as
complicated or tricky as one would think
so cool I can do it while it's paused
it's neat
right yeah I like that if you're on a
phone you can actually like move it
around to move with you yeah like a
little VR thing all you have to do to do
this is just put all of your videos or
pictures or whatever you gonna do in a
grid right like in kind of a geometric
grid with rows and columns so I so first
I had to figure out like mathematically
cuz I made a couple of more videos than
what is shown here but I had to trim a
few to get an even something squared so
it's like I think it's 13 by 13
so like 13 videos in a row and 13 rows
something like that so then I have to go
and see like the hardest part was just
making this grid so in the 16 by 9 grid
in Premiere you just kind of tediously
better than it was it a task on your
computer it was and originally when I
hit the little export button it was like
booop 400 hours left and I was freaking
out because I you know I wanted this out
now whose I don't have patience so what
I did was I kind of tricked it so I only
exported like two rows at a time and my
computer could handle that in minutes so
like I did the first two rows you know
and then in the next two rows and then
finally I just got like when everything
was exported then I threw all the videos
together on top of each other hanka and
just kind of cropped and my computer's
just handed that handled that fine and
as well I won't you want to congrat I
mean that's just an export setting so
you just make sure like when you export
the video there's a little thing you
click in Premiere that's like VR
enjoy this ya know it's really it's
really nice on the ears
absolutely 170 videos playing at one it
sounds like a nightmare yeah this is
kind of this is the last thing you see
before you die good night yeah I want to
look into the gates of Hell all right
this is kind of thank you very much it's
a really powerful way to review all the
content you it was it was either that or
like a best of 2017 video and I was like
nah screw that I mean how many videos
total where in there 169 nice yeah
congratulation oh we've made like 360 in
our whole career mmm Janome videos you
made on your channel about a thousand
something like wow I finally hit the
thousand one hundred and sixty nine
videos worth of good times yes right and
the monetization amen to that
how are you getting slammed now okay I'm
fine yeah yours are super
family-friendly yeah how about that I
can't complain you're not kidding yeah
no I mean there's still like video I
forgot the blur out in nipple and it
kept getting like you got the monetizing
what I do
oh they kind of nipped that algorithm
good sense then it found it or somebody
reported it like Oh nipple was I
wandering here couple of those now
doesn't even leave alone I was just
reading one somebody was in character as
Bernie Sanders I remember when I used to
give good dick like that that's funny
somebody sent it to me on Twitter
there's a nipple on the side that sucks
that aside I'm fine I was hanging out
with idubbbz once we were when we're
shooting the video I remember I don't
remember what video we're making at the
time but he had uploaded a video and his
and for one frame his nuts were visible
yet forgot he had not blurred it for one
so we rushed home and luckily there is a
there's a thing on YouTube you can now
edit it post problems right you can
which was shocked to me I didn't know
that I was like man you got it you got
to get in there and get that nut out
right I've got a real or that home he
got to it before YouTube did and so oh
thank god
I don't know that there's there may be
images of his nuts floating around to
this day but yeah wouldn't ya if it was
up there for a minute I'm sure somebody
captured it it was like a split second
floating around on 4chan somewhere it's
like a wand Bitcoin on someone's hard
drive there it is I was watching this
video also Jack and I just you might
noticed I am fascinated by Pitbull are
you you I don't I don't underst what's
the deal with pitbull why is he so funny
and also yes why is he so popular yeah
um I don't
okay look I'm gonna try and tackle the
second one but the first one I he's just
he's a meme cuz it's pitbull nobody in
the history of the world has ever been
like man I could really go for some pit
bull right now know was pitbull but
people he's so popular right oh yeah
he's a Multi multi multi-millionaire I
mean he's got a show in Vegas like he's
super popular I think he just makes no I
think he just like there that's my guy
and his photos are just out of this plan
oh he's just she's this guy he's just
choosing just mr. worldwide make a chili
a girl like a million yeah oh you went
through a pitbull phase yeah I just love
it look at his [ __ ] face bro so smug
he is mr. smug to the right of that I
think as a winner I find him to be the
most normal looking here because he's
trying so hard to be like men in black
like bro yeah okay just hear him
one left oh that one too no now that's
my pit bull rumours has it pit bull try
to remove this photo from this that's my
Uncle Fester oh man I think I need to
get down there and find a better photo
but I think I think part of the charm is
that like his music is just kind of like
very easy party music club anthems they
say like there's no message there's no
like greater message it's just like he
has a song literally about fire ball you
know it's just like Eric I don't think
it is what's this most popular song [ __ ]
that's a good question me yo time of our
lives that was the one that you were

than all of us so back off hater he
survived oh [ __ ]

callous I just said that without
thinking yeah it's the funniest thing
I've heard in weeks
but like it makes me wonder if he's
doing all these make her wishes what
Sina hiding yeah I like that approach to
life way more than just being like oh
he's a great guy
being like what are you hiding bro I
have no I have no more dangerous world
record
yeah always suspicious why are you so
insecure it's like when you go to New
York and you go down in the subway and
the guys like hey man don't don't buy
one of those Metro tickets I got one you
should give me a dollar and I'll let you
here I'm like wait no I don't know what
do you have planned even though it's
economically a better deal you're not
gonna it seems like you're doing me a
solid here but some songs off yeah your
intuition is correct on that one there
but anyways pitbulls great he's awesome
he's a he's a musical genius
yeah and he does a lot of great things
though and these guys smile oh my god he
look he may be just a musical genius
that looks really good I want to see the
rest of his teeth before I make any
judgment at least I've only seen these I
want to see the rest of what he's got in
there all right pitbull if you're
listening and I know you are send me a
picture though some team of interest
thing I want to talk about Logan Paul
I mean who obviously everybody's you
know but I wanted to get your guys's hot
take about what's going on there I mean
you guys have any original thoughts on
that I don't think that like I thought
he had some great points you know no so
he wants to he wants to come back he's
ready to come back and that was the that
was the Twitter headline moment whatever
that wouldn't imitation Libre yeah let
me know there was actually a TMZ TMZ
deserves a second chance right he
actually seems this is really this is
good content you guys don't don't snuff
yet okay yeah I like serious ting stuff
I liked your post about TMZ moment oh I
haven't seen the video I don't know
those videos great by the way and he's
he's in grief right now about it still
walking around me for what well his
career
oh he's in full pink maverick gear yeah
like bro where swear something else for
now that's the grieving color of choice
absolutely know the port while I feel
really bad the poor guy has to rely on
his on his merch sales right now because
he can't upload videos on YouTube at the
moment cuz he's in grieving Horgan oh
and you can only rely on his you know
eight figure merch sales I feel really
bad for the kid I've heard that he makes
I mean this is all rumor but I believe
three million a month emerge god bless
that sounds about right
honestly yeah that's I'd be surprised if
not more that's what by the way shake
your dick playboy like I'm not hating
I'm just more interested yeah I mean
yeah they're doing something right from
a business model that's true and that's
welcome everybody to another episode of
the h3 podcast a lie what up
today's episode is sponsored by the
elderscrolls legends quip and Teddy
fresh oh wow but that's us that's us my
friends we have for you today planned a
cringe miss miracle and by miracle I
mean disaster arrangements cringe miss I
mean take from that what you will
we were scheduled to have Tommy Wiseau
today and unfortunately due to
scheduling or whatever happens in
people's lives you could not make it but
it was serendipitous so I say that right
serendipitous I don't know I'm missing
an accent there it was serendipitous
anyway because we were planning this
huge h3 video about Jake and Logan
Paul's merch machine the church of merch
oh my god I have the culture sure I
forgot to wear it right it's okay I can
channel it spiritually we were planning
on HD to make this huge Logan and Jake
Paul video because the way that they
plugged their merch has evolved before
like during the the everyday bro period
when they first exact I won when they
first started it was cheeky it was cute
like hey God Church merch weak wink buy
my merch but it's actually transformed
into something a little bit more
nefarious a little bit more dark and
manipulative predatory even in my in my
opinion and since the Christmas season
came it was such a big season for them
the way that they marketed it was really
something to behold so I was putting
together chronology and all the ways
that they marketing their merch recently
but we're leaving on the 31st to go
visit Ella's family in Israel and we
just don't have the time to do it so I
we put together all this content all
these videos and we said hey this this
will work in the podcast format anyway
so today
we have for you a an extravaganza a
study this kept put your cringe suits on
but it's more than that there's
something interesting here that I think
is worth taking a closer look at so
that's what we're up to today
now this like I was saying just to touch
on something really brief this is the
last episode of season one I like to
call it season two we're coming back on
what day would come back the 19th I
think of January we'll be back and I'm
and I'm really seriously toying with the
idea of coming back strong season 2
thinking about maybe doing five shows a
week bring on a writer
why get serious as hell what I would
love what I would love and I'm again I'm
not this isn't final I'm just toying
with the idea maybe you guys can bounce
some ideas but like keep the interview
once a week on Friday I then have like
30 minute episodes every other day of
the week where we tackle some topic
every day something that's come up with
in this case we're talking about this
merch machine I think one day a week
should be about shredder one day put on
shredder Karen please okay so yeah we've
maybe five all five days about shredder
yeah
you lose obsessed for sure how are you
gonna live without shredder for eight
days nine days ten days anyway so let's
begin this is gonna be interesting for
me so you guys know Jake and Logan Paul
as the cringy child entertainer
goofballs that they've been they've
they've owned this year on YouTube and
I'm not I can't mince words and I can't
deny them any credit those guys hustle
they work hard they shredded they shred
they're savages by the way they also
ruin everything I love well I don't say
I love savages but they they ruin things
Savage you can't use that
word anyone dabbing I think Logan Paul
single-handedly killed daddy daddy was
like cool for a minute like rappers were
dabbing and now all the sudden Logan's
like oh I'm gonna I'm gonna have all my
eight-year-old white kids dabbing and
they're like double dad you just see him
on video he said this is still funny is
it lit hey I saw that in the chat lit he
ruined he ruined Gucci yeah
Logan's walking around in Gucci and it's
like bro you you if I was good she I
wouldn't I would make it a policy Tesla
it's not just him but they killed Tesla
as well I have I mean he'll I got a
Tesla I'm thinking about returning it
but it's not just him every it seems
like it's the YouTube dish doucher car
these days I'm gonna buy a Tesla I
bought it because I care about electric
vehicles I wanted to help
Elon in his mission to protect humanity
I'm returning it I'm returning all my
sisters with savage on it to which you
have zero oh I had a ton of savage stuff
before if I was saying if I was gay I
would make it a policy not to sell to
them what do you mean that's kind of
know that we would probably fall in that
same category I don't that's why we met
that's why we're like Gucci clothing I
think it's cool but we're like don't
what would they say we don't sell it to
youtubers fine whatever just whatever
whatever it takes man just get it off
him all right but so not that anyone can
even afford that's it yeah it's like
come on he's walking around in one of
these videos with like a ten thousand
dollar Gucci like denim jacket I love
their clothing it's ridiculously priced
but I admire what they're doing it's
really cool
take it off bro you ruined the brand you
just did millions of all these rappers
there they're returning the Gooch I have
a tracksuit you guys saw it from the
vapenation
and 150 battery ma'am I burned it but
something's changed something has
changed they used to be cheeky and cute
about selling merch and what I think has
happened is that they're so competitive
with each other and they share the same
fans that they're having like the
psychological warfare they're each being
forced to ramp up how aggressively they
sell merch to top the other one because
they're there competing for the same
audience the same kids and they're all
have this identity crisis of I'm reject
Paul or I'm a SAP I'm a maverick Logan
Logan so they're stepping it up
possibly unconsciously in a way and it's
come to the point where they're
basically telling kids throw out the
[ __ ] your parents bought you and I'm not
making something yeah and one of the
videos will watch logan paul says throw
out whatever [ __ ] santé aka your parents
bought you and pick up this maverick
merch and the more maverick mercs you
have is how much my love increases for
you it's like it reminds me of this some
show I love Nathan for you he has this
bit where he has he's trying to market
this toy and if you don't know the
premise of the show he does these really
ridiculous unpractical solutions
offensive in some ways and he's got this
toy that won't sell so he has all these
kids in at a table about eight same
[ __ ] ages these guys as fans and he's
like so this toy everyone who doesn't
have this toy is a baby the only way
that you can be a big boy is if you have
this toy and so he gives it one to one
to everyone except one kid he's like do
you feel like a baby you're a baby right
now do you want this toy and the kids
like yeah that's what they're doing gosh
they're like and another thing before we
get into the videos that I want you guys
to focus on there they become like
YouTube mobsters they started to churn
out these music videos and the point of
a music video is usually to entertain to
provide a song and a dance right but
what they're doing is
these these are essentially more
commercial and to sell their March than
it is to entertain and so they're doing
a kind of like a double a double take
like you show up to the storefront
pretending that they're selling a jeans
once you you know blow out the candles
and close the blinds and when mommy's
not in the room it's crack it's not an
actual crack it's metaphorical crack
which is much scarier you'll see what I
mean it's it's all about their merch and
there's almost no content left and the
craziest part is at the end of these
songs they still go by this song on
iTunes it's like buying a Taco Bell
jingle for some [ __ ] on iTunes
it's like demolition man if you guys
have seen that so let's just you know
and let me just say also there's nothing
wrong with merchandise I mean especially
in these days a merchandise is the
lifeblood of a lot of youtubers it's
huge for us particularly and a lot of
other people but when it becomes the
entire body of your work and the soul of
everything you do it becomes strange and
especially when you're selling it to
kids who don't have their own money and
you're saying [ __ ] like tell your mom
like I'm this is a lyric you wanna tell
your mom buy everything in my store and
throw out throw out your other [ __ ] it's
good it crosses into Scientology like
levels of weird cultish vibes so it mic
thesis here is that there's some brain
there's some legitimate brainwashing
going on
it's very predatory on these kids and
they're selling like garbage there's
this one I want to show you I don't want
to ruin the surprise but some of this
merch will just drop your jaw so let's
start I've got a game plan here let's
see how far they've strayed from God's
light or as Jake Paul would say from God
church's light it's been a while since
we have goofed on the old blind boy
Logan Paul so let's start there this is
around six months ago
same time that everyday bro blew up and
I think I've been around that time
everybody started understanding that you
turn out these music videos and it's
like this insane
easy to produce money machine because
they sell the song they plugged the
merch and it's like this whole thing it
is crazy they get so many views every
day bro what are the views on that let
me know that was that was a bit of a
phenomenon but a lot of them I remember
that was like on the top charts on
iTunes too but this video has 160
million that's crazy
yeah I mean that that's pop star numbers
yeah so I don't know let's let's start
with here you guys know that one so I'm
not gonna bother showing that to you
this one is special to me called Logan
is my hero let's pull this up this has
42 Mille Miglia I'm not gonna make fun
of this kid he's a sweet-ass kid I don't
want to say anything bad about this poor
there's sweet beautiful wonderful child
he's sweet and I love him to bits right
EULA so I'm gonna cut out this whole I
don't understand that I haven't done the
research maybe I'm missing something but
why does why does Logan look like a
[ __ ] lesbian in the shot but what is
going on with this look bro why do you
look like Ellen's cousin why do you look
like your own mother it's weird
but anyway that's I guess that's uh so
this this can't made a video about how
hey Logan you're my hero god bless
I want to they're always Melbourne merch
you don't have a focus music video of 27
feet okay so this kid made a music video
about Logan hey you're my hero and he's
like this is cool I'm gonna fly him out
and make a music video together okay so
this is the result and this is from six
months ago this is before this is when
there was still a flicker of light in
his eyes he's getting completely fallen
into the chasm the black death chasm
from like the newest Star Wars movie mmm
the Dark Side chasm that's where he's
fallen into no it's a fact that everyone
has a hero yeah yeah and sometimes when
you're tickled just the right way you
gotta make a dumb ass song about it fact
so this is that dumb ass song that will
fact and guess what the fact I'm feeling
tickled yeah yeah I saw this video
saying though before we get deep into
this it's also worth remembering that
all the life he wrote this song cuz
there's a lot of dick sucking of him
being like you're the wisest you're the
coolest and he's like really you think
so it's like yeah but you wrote this
line about yourself Hogan you're my hero
saying I'm the man like I'm some type of
Robert De Niro I don't know why though
this kid looks like he's shy though but
he talked that track like a gosh
dreamz why they so obsessed with that
amazing oh my gosh I missed that I
missed that
I'm so sorry I interrupted this
incredible my favorite the joke that I
was hanging out with posts and his
brother Jordan and Jordan had a really
funny observation he's like Logan is
like the stereotypical white rapper that
everyone makes fun of who's like hi my
name is Logan and I'm here to say buy my
merch or else you're gay which is
essentially what this song blows down to
that's amazing that's amazing
was that good should I put on paper so
write that down down write that down
with you copy
okay bro
oh he green screens out the pool and
puts in Martin Luther King jr. can you
think of a more tasteless thing like but
here take the whole thing and as a body
but I'm not saying that he's not are you
not saying that he's not Martin Luther
King because that kid is not Martin
Luther King empirically so and then look
like bro poor MLK can't rest in peace
they green-screen his ass in the [ __ ]
back of the stare with his ass like
grinning it's disturbing also and okay
it's just like the weirdest comparison
ever this is probably the anything you
can go
I was relevant to this kid's life look
at this okay
so funny I'm not saying that it is but
I'm not saying that he isn't I think
it's not what are you saying he might
yeah what do you say you're you're
essentially saying that you're not
saying anything I'm not saying just drop
my Martin Martin's name and okay let's
try and get some street cred here dude
is Martin Luther King he's gonna KITT
you know he's gonna do he's gonna ruin
Martin Luther King for everybody we have
to erase him from the history books I
think the next one is also yeah he's
gonna start selling merch with MLK face
on it
maybe you're the next MLK be a maverick
a maverick he would have been if he was
alive today
I don't know now who are you to say that
this kid I am okay only the cold yeah I
just think the comparison to MLK and
Kanye is just double bizarre double fact
double dab double bizarre okay who are
you to say that this kid ain't MLK or
even Kanye by the way notice how they
they key in [ __ ] here's MLK
delivering his speech for Logan Paul to
sell merch okay yeah they put his ass in
the back Phil can you even tell her what
is that it's the most tasteless [ __ ]
I've ever seen in my life
this kid doesn't do anything either look
at him just he's like cool I can't I
don't say I'm not making fun of the kid
he's a sweetheart
I love
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Laughter]
just remember you wrote this okay I'm
sorry I don't mean Ciro people [ __ ] I
don't know the people need heroes and I
don't know that they need to make songs
with the heroes it's weird it's a little
creepy you worship me I worship this guy
he writes in the lyrics you worship me
I'm your hero
the insinuation that he would ever
answer his phone if this could have
called him and cracked me up as if he's
got like a giant presidential phone that
plugs him right through you know he gets
text from him and he's just like ignore
I'm sorry dude
hit me up hit me up if you ever need
advice that's where it gets like
tasteless and this is six months ago so
he still has some soul left but it's
like alarmingly tasteless because he's
making this wholesome song with this kid
and I also wouldn't criticize it if it
wasn't for the mirch undertones
he's making this wholesome song
celebrating this kid he flew him out but
then all of a sudden his this kid is an
accessory he becomes like a pawn an
actor and then someone's like the fact
that is Wade this kid is using it as a
shield like you can't criticize him
because he made a nice act exam thinking
like he's probably gonna look at us like
oh look at them how dare you make fun of
me I did this wonderful thing for this
kid who could ever talk [ __ ] about me
this was a wonderful thing but he's
using this kid as an actor he's using
him in an advertisement and he's saying
okay now at this point of the movie the
video I'm gonna hand you this mervich
maverick sweater and you're gonna seem
super happy
what's his cut on that by the way does
he have any back does he owe me
royalties on this commercial but yeah
he's using he's using the kid and it
becomes less wholesome and and it's very
very tasteless this whole link in the
box but here it's really it's not that
bad yet we want to show this as where
things started right it's a it's a
little tasteless it's a it's a little
tasteless
right there's part where it's just like
part of the bit is him saying merch in
the background it gets bad it gets so
much worse than this but this is just a
chronology the goodbye everybody needs
someone to idolize
everybody needs someone to idolize I
think that's pretty unhealthy suggestion
I don't think that idolizing anyone is a
healthy all right and as someone's Idol
I don't think you need to fly them out
and write them lyrics of young kids or
basically on his knees worshipping you
as his hero yeah he's like you idolize
me that's great let me love that about
you
yeah capable doing that I don't know
anything about you but you idolize me
apparently all right listen you got a
full pizza there you're sharing the
slice what the why whatever we don't
need to the kids worse
why are you sure to slice
yeah so there's 30 love that there's a
lot to chew on here so this is when it
gets into kind of the brainwashing and I
know you might think I'm getting
ridiculous but but listen to how
ridiculous this is
and okay the fact that in his mind when
they're producing this song he has the
presence of mind to just throw in and he
does this throughout the song emerge
it's Bray I think it's brainwashing I
really do merge and like just you know
it happens several times throughout and
it's kind of hard to catch so it's
pretty it's pretty weird
but there's also something here I wanted
to comment on as well what are they
planning
how many 72 virgins in paradise are you
stopping crime or committing it hang
with virgins and paradise that's not
appropriate merch with a kid yeah let's
go hang with the cuties in Paris
let's go spit roast some cuties together
it's a little inappropriate but it's
insinuated merge merge you want to go
tag that was Judi I think we can move on
to the other stuff that was like the
under part Oh ela there's come on you're
gonna deprive everyone wanna finishing
this I'm trying to save people no this
is come on
[Music]
my man is a savage I can see it in his
eyes
you're really wise oh okay
he wrote this yeah Logan
you really wise also true double effect
merge merge merge merge merge merge okay
welcome back everybody to the h3 podcast
live today's episode is sponsored by
hims naturebox
Dollar Shave Club kaptara and the Elder
Scrolls legends next week oh my god I
forgot to put the thread up again every
time we'll be up after the live and
before the vaad hits youtube but next
week we have Tommy Wiseau the creator
and star of the room finger he's coming
on I'd say we'd had a tweet exchange
with him we spoke with his manager this
morning and it's confirmed it's also are
the last episode of this season one but
I'll talk more about that later there's
a thread up for questions for Tommy on
our subreddit go ahead and post them
there but let's get on to this week's
guest the illustrious and wonderful
Brendon green creator producer designer
of the massively successful most played
game on Steam yes biggest game ever on
Steam yes well not officially out today
yes we yeah with an astonishing 25
million copies sold approximately right
oh yeah 25 uh-huh and concurrent players
in the millions I've never seen anything
they just smashed we're going three
million concurrence today if you think
about that that's one-third or one out
of every hundred Americans playing this
game at once but it's I wonder what's
the geographical breakdown of that I
have a data team that worried about yeah
yeah sure but it had any rate oh no it's
been it's not it's like globally growing
and it's crazy I've know I've honestly
not seen anything like it since
minecraft really this game has pretty
much defined this year in gaming it's
unprecedented and I'm very happy and
honored to introduce Brendon green thank
you for joining us I appreciate it nice
wonderful salve year before we get into
deep here I just want to say if you guys
have any questions please give us a call
at eight one eight two one four eight
five zero four that's not your personal
number right okay
he was saying he thought he'd be funny
if we just posted his person over give
him a call do you have any question I'd
be a little twisted on the joke so for
people that don't know you or the game
can you talk a little bit about what pub
G is and what is the Battle Royale genre
okay so I started making mods like four
or five years ago on ARMA 2 and then
moved ARMA 3 and I created this
game-mode the battle royale game-mode
right and it got licensed by h1 about
three years ago now for inclusion in h1
that eventually became king of the kill
and then last year Blue Hole contacted
me from Korea and said we love what
you've done with a battle royale game
we'd like you to lead a team and make
your own battle royale and pop G was
born out of that so how did you get
that's like a lot and oh yeah right you
know there's like first of all how did
you get into making them a mod for ArmA
like so yeah where were you at the time
give me your humble story your humble
beginnings okay so I started off in
Brazil I would therefore love and
looking divorce and then was saving to
come home and I got back into gaming by
finding the dayz mod' I'd read some
stuff on Reddit Abed and I thought this
sounds really cool there's no rules
there's nothing it's just survive and I
really liked that idea with just a
survival game all right so I kind of
fell in love with the dayz mod and
formed or found a squad to play with
them that's how I kind of learned about
modding cuz the dayz mod was a mod so I
had a look at how it was made are you
were you programming then no I was a web
designer photographer I knew code just
from using javascript and jQuery so if I
died in websites but you know I wasn't a
coder my code is terrible like if people
tell me to fix the game if I try to fix
the game the servers would explode you
know your computer would burn so you
were able to make it using the modding
tools well yes so the code in an ARMA
sqf is kind of like JavaScript so it's
kind of an easy to understand so I just
looked at what other people had done and
beg borrow and stole code and just like
fast people just like for help and
the community and arm have really really
helpful about like helping you so I
created my own dayz mod' server for
people to play on messed with loot
tables just created more weapons and we
ended up creating something people
called like the cod of of dayz because
it was just about the PvP it was there
was no real survival it was just you
died didn't give a [ __ ] go one and just
keep going again right and again and
again and just it's all about the PvP so
after doing that for about six months I
kind of decided listen I wanted to make
a mod I'd seen what Brian Hicks and
Jordan ter did with the survivor games
this kind of streamer centric
competition and I liked what they did
but I thought okay I want to play this
I'm a streamer and I can't so let me see
if I can make something and I thought I
could improve some things they were
doing and battle royale game-mode was
born on Daisy
I basically modded a mod that's so great
it's it's incredible
and it's inspiring that you without even
being much of a background in pro or
game - oh yeah I know I disabled a very
many games I mean I wasn't like big
gamer you know oh I don't like this
seeing some of the people I meet at
conventions I am in no way a gamer I
just don't know how I wonder if that's
why I actually really loved the game
player I know like I'm not a gamer at
all
from the first moment I saw Ethan play
it I was like that's why like you you
were not a gamer necessarily and you
made again that you wanted to play
exactly yeah that's what I think it's
like I wasn't sort of I didn't have
rules of game design to follow I didn't
like when I first went to blue hole I
had many arguments with JC or League
game designer because he was like but
that's not the way I was taught to make
games or the way that they were taught
to make games I was like but it's okay
to break the rules here because people
obviously enjoy it and when I came to
making it it was it was very especially
the first one if you complained it was
too hard I'd make it harder you know it
was like you know I didn't like easy
games I liked to be challenged and I
like I think you know the win rating in
our game the amount of times you win is
so much lower than every other game you
know but that's the joy of it you know
it is because it's tough it's easy
concept survive right um it's a tough
game to master so I think that's why
it's been so frustrating right
oh yeah oh my god I've plucked many
hours and I my background is like I
played like 2,000 hours of dota 2 mmm
and I've played like a thousand hours
plus of counter-strike hmm and so I have
experienced an FPS and I get [ __ ] but
it's addictive you can't stop cuz you
start with nothing right it's every yeah
you know it's funny we had doctor
disrespect on here and he described it
the best way I've heard anyone say I'm
like why is this game so popular and he
says to me it's the story right every
new game has a story there's a narrative
experience its compresses that kind of
Daisy like long story into like 30
minutes and it's like what did I get
this round oh I got the S case yeah
anxious and and I just I think it
compresses that just unique story every
time and it's a simple game to learn you
know it's gotta be the popular he's got
to be tied in to the fact that it's such
watchable hmm it's a it's by far the
most streamed game oh yeah and it's
really fun to watch which is uh like if
you compared to something like dota 2
ice even though I love the game I can't
watch it I can't like I don't I've been
to League tournaments in uh in Korea I
don't understand these games yeah I know
it's like unless you pay especially
don't it like you have you see they have
the noob stream you know where the
commentator is kind of going well this
is why this is like this you have to
have played like a thousand hours just
to understand what you're watching yeah
but and and our game is simple to watch
you know it's it's very easy to
understand and even like you know this
guy is toast he's a hearthstone player
he said even like when he's playing
hearts on his mother and sister have no
clue you know of no interest but when
he's 9 babji they're like oh this is the
settler right ya know and that's I think
again it's the simplicity of the game
it's like and it's just the randomness
every time you know it's still not super
random but it is that it's a unique
story of reader so when you saw when you
started working on her you had the idea
to make this was it like you saw it as a
as a business opportunity that was there
or were you was it just a passion real
like hey this is a great thing I want to
develop this I wanted to make a game I
wanted to play like I wanted to play the
survivor games I thought this is a
really cool game mode right but because
it was for streamers only I couldn't
play it and I thought okay I want to
just try this and then see if I can make
a game mode that I can play with my
friends and if other people enjoy
even you know if not I still have a game
mode I can play with my friends right
there was my intention just have a a
popular server you know that would you
know people would enjoy playing the game
like when we had a popular dayz mod'
server I would sit on the server like
four hours at night just kicking people
with low bandwidth not playing the game
just like hiding in a bush and kicking
people with low bandwidth so everyone
else on the server could enjoy because
I'm low bandwidth if you had low
bandwidth you desync the whole server
really right that's it's just a way that
the armour network code of the time
worked huh that if you have a bad
connection you'd like it because it
wasn't like it was just synchronous
packets or like a single spot if one
person got blocked then all these other
ones got blocked and then people will
get kicked because they're getting no
response so you are just ensuring that
the server experience yes wrong to keep
a good and I didn't mind if you were
like but don't you want to play less
like well no these people can play when
I say you know and I like like seeing a
night without any yellow or red chains
you know you're kind of gone yeah that's
[ __ ] awesome so I made this for those
people to enjoy it wasn't I always saw
it as kind of I'd love to do a big
spectacle in eSports you know because
I'd see like dota and csgo and stuff and
yes these events are massive but it's
still two teams of five on the stage you
know and I wanted to fill a stadium with
people and put like a hundred people in
the centre and you know and that kind of
big like spectacle in eSports rather
than just two teams of five is that
where you see the game going I hope so
like I mean really I mean that's that's
the dream for me is like one point
always great and we get to raise a full
game but until we have our first major
that's where I really see kind of rife
it's kind of that's the dream completes
them you want our stadium with a hundred
players at the in the pit or the field
yeah and have like whatever thirty forty
thousand people watching I'm having that
first person to get down walk off yeah
shame it's like a long walk oh yeah
people in the audience like heads of
lettuce throw down that would actually
be quite I can see when it comes down to
like the final two or three of that that
would be pretty exhilarating right
[Music]
that's fine oh yeah but this like I mean
that's what I always dreamed that that
could be a great eSport you know and I
think it's I still think it could be so
what do you think are the
challenges that exist that you might
that you're aware of or want to overcome
to make sure that pub G can become a
great sport we have to get the game
eSports ready right I mean it's not
competitive well it is competitive but
it's not it's not completely bug free
you know there's lots of stuff we have
to improve and that's what we want to
spend like you know I keep saying like
this is 1.0 is a milestone for us it's
not the end of development we want to
continue over the next year to keep
improving you know that there may be
problems that launch tonight but we're
not gonna just leave them you know we
want to keep fixing and some of these
problems are really really hard to fix
you know there's there's problems that
are with the core engine itself that if
we try to fix them or touch them it
might end up with a hundred other
problems you know you're talking about
issues like pure rubber banding but this
is the big lie so rubber banding is
frustrating for me alone yeah so the why
that is and we're still trying to figure
it out but it's basically there we are
graded the engine from four one six or
four one four four one six right and
that change gave us a lot of network
problems and we're still trying to
figure out why those are occurring but
its core engine code and it's we have a
small team still relatively speaking
what we're still expanding but it's it's
quite tough to find good talent right
you know and tantor fits the company and
talent understands you know what we're
doing and are good enough to you know to
do the job we need them to do so it's
time you can't throw money at it you
know it's it just takes time and
eventually we get them but it's it just
yeah it's the network problem it's still
gonna be there probably at launch you
may see some rubber banding which sucks
but it's we're still trying to fix it
you know and it's I'm sure frustrates
you guys as much as people that are
always complaining oh no I mean it's
like you know oh no like we have like
guys that are in the office you know 14
15 hour days trying to figure this [ __ ]
out like really like they pour their
hearts and soul into it like if there's
a problem with the service today they
will not leave the office until the
servers are fix you know that they're
really dedicated to making this a great
experience and it when I hear people
like ragging on the dev team really like
I get mad because it's like you don't
understand how hard they work they
really you know and some people like oh
but we pay you know this you we expect
them to work 24 hours a day you know
the issue is that the game has become
almost unreasonably successful it's a
pre-release oh well at least until
tonight is the official release right
that's right and so you've got melee
you've sold 25 million copies but and
then people forget you know that this is
a pre-release and people are expecting
because you guys have so much revenue
coming in oh there's no excuse right I
know but I mean even our servers and
like you know functions like battle
lines about it costs in millions of
dollars you know it for what a month you
know per month for servers for all these
additional costs that like yes we have
made some money from selling the game
but there's all these additional costs
that you don't realize you know under
we've tried throwing monies at servers
but that doesn't fix them you know it's
like it takes time and a lot of these as
I said are really their core engine
issues that you have to do them very
carefully because like that's why we
couldn't update the live servers with
the test build was because there were so
many issues with the test build because
it was a different version of the engine
that we couldn't roll it out to three
million people you know or 25 million
people you know we just couldn't do that
to the play race that's why we had to
keep the live version was stable it
wasn't great but it was stable whereas
the test version not so stable but now
we've got to a stage now that there may
still be crashes there may be so be real
rounding but we are still working on it
you know yeah we want to you know we
want to get it stable we want to get a
kind of here yeah so gameplay-wise
work what do you see are the challenges
has become to becoming a competitive
game
we just need to balance stuff like the
blue zone you know we really do need to
do some passes on the blue zone to make
it more competitive and fairer for
players so people who don't know what
the blue zone is in the game this battle
royale genre I guess you would call it
there's a never shrinking plays
aggressive there's ever shrinking play
zone the timer runs out and there's this
blue cancer the creeps towards you and
if you don't stand beside the blue wall
you die yeah and so what about that is
is unbalanced in your opinion we just
have to look at like you know sometimes
it may jump too much or that the
distance may be too long or it might be
moving too fast so we haven't had a lot
of times always moving too fast right
but no I mean it's it's these kind of
things that we need to look at the data
and the players and and figure out like
what is best competitively for the game
to give everyone a fair chance and that
takes time but you know look at csgo
they're still releasing small updates
everything was right and that's we want
to be that you know that's what we want
that we want to continue to use over the
next 10 20 years you know and it we're
gonna take time to balance this but know
we have the data we just need to pick
through it so it just takes time these
you know this is I keep saying this is
just not a marathon or this is not a
sprint for us this is really a marathon
like it's we were building a team now
that we want to support this for 10 20
years you know and yeah one thing that
for me has been the hallmark of every
game with longevity has been and I guess
you would appreciate this more anyone
this scene for modding and custom games
okay I look back did you ever play like
Starcraft or Warcraft trying to conquer
yeah that did they have modding I don't
remember no I don't think so
but at least I didn't mod so at any rate
starcraft brood war I played that game
for like a decade and most we would
played that didn't even play the actual
competitive aspect one was playing the
custom maps is that something you guys
have planned well if we'd love to like
we have custom games already right you
guys know yeah clay that a lot of them
which is great right and we want to give
more fine great control over those
custom games so you can really start
playing around and creating unique link
other game modes like now that right I
just give you guys so much control and
and maybe allow you know other things to
plug into that but you know as for
complete modding like you'd see say an
armor maybe not yes you know I don't
know because this is a competitive game
so like what I want like this is going
to be a competitive game so if you start
opening up to modding it opens up to
cheating and a whole thing really it
opens up to cheating well it's it just
means that like you're opening up parts
of your engine to let people play with
and I don't think that if we don't do it
correctly it could end up you know being
bad for security so you know we realize
there's this whole like you know that we
can't just add modding you know because
we need to and as well like you know
releasing our server files for people to
host our own servers again will you know
could lead to priority and in China and
so forth at where someone releases an
exact clone of our game and you know
things like this so like these are all

It was actually much worse than that I was a full episode
I co-starred mean HeLa both in an entire episode. No Kidding. It was a whole fucking thing. I got electrocuted, bro
For real yes

If you didn't die you weren't electrocuted so shocked
I'm sure there's some other word but yea electrocuted.
Look it up. You have the power. I believe you I believe you.
I'm just I've said  "that shocks me" I'm not saying that I know every word

more Brad Berry
more Brad Berry yeah
That's one set of lips you may not like. This very mic?
Yeah, you keep this mic here, and you guys use the same mics every time. Yeah, well we...we have switched around.
What? Well I have been there before and here.
This is my mic. I don't know what Hila has been up too.
Ethan doesn't move.
I don't fucking...I don't let anyone use this mic.
Where was moo?
He was right there.
We bleached it though when he was done. Thank you.
I bleached it like halfway through the show
He was like protect me from myself. Yeah, I was like sorry buddy
How's the show change, I mean last time you were here
We had like tape it was it was kind of a funky setup right. Yeah, I was on that couch I think. Yeah.
Which was very comfortable now? I'm I do feel kind of tall with this chair being up high
But I'm afraid to move it cuz then the Michael have to move it'll just the Mike is very everyone. Yeah, the micah
Yeah, the mike but what if I don't move it right? What if I get too low?
I just want to get fishing you can really just manhandle this thing. Okay. Well. How are you? How have you been?
I mean how the hell is life since we last spoke with you. It's great. You know it's been it's been fantastic
I just got back from the brain candy fall tour
And that is you know it's a it's a slog you know everyday
You got a show well six days a week, and they get one day off we perform in Kansas City my hometown
gave shout outs to some teachers that made a difference in my life when were there in the audience and
Got to have my grandmother's come
You know couldn't really make it very far away from Kansas City's having the show there
It was really cool that is very cool
You do it six out
So how long do these tours last because you says you do it six times a week at once a day six times a week
So how long is that duration? It could be four weeks like this fall one, but in the spring we did nine
Holy, no break. I mean how?
Level with me Michael how awful is it? Yeah?
It's it's not because here's the thing Adam Savage has been traveling and touring for years
He knows how to make it nice, so we've got star coaches right. We've got rooms in the back of these buses. We drive
Overnight right you wake up whenever you want to because you don't have to worry about the show until like 6:00 p.m.
So you've got a day to just lay in bed go to the dressing room. I could do a lot of work
I can still make my regular calls and I can visit the cities. I'm away from home
I'm away from my cats Millay from my wife. I'm away from the Vsauce office. That's a drag right but
meeting people in person is
Really important. You know you can watch a YouTube video and and
Engage with me that way, but when you meet in person or when you turn it your whole evening
And it just coming to a live show it's a bigger part of your life. I think you know you remember it longer
You've been to show. Yeah, we really we're in Costa Mesa right there's in Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara. That's right
Yeah, so I remember
It's a total blast. It's a total rock really the kids they love the goddamn balls
Balls well they're free yeah, there's free balls. I mean guys free balls that you you really you're selling tickets to bring candy
But we you should really be selling us free balls free balls coming well. They're not free
Free it's lots of balls and then underneath in parentheses brain candy brain candy yeah
paper balls
balls yeah stay for the candy
Yeah, I found that to be true as well
I mean when you meet a fan you writ that personal connection or realizing that these like real people
watching your oh
man
and the best thing is that especially because I'm touring with Adam Savage a lot of makers come to the shows people who have a
craft people who love
To make things and they make us stuff
They make us wire sculptures a guy made these muppet type puppets of Adam, and I that are just phenomenal
I mean it's not like I tried it's like I'm a professional here normally
This would have probably been thousands of dollars
And I just made it because I love making puppets and now I have a puppet of myself which
So you're collecting treasures?
You collect treasures, that's that's powerful. Yeah. How I do get nervous before the shows
I mean, this is a serious production and there's a lot of people in the audience
Create these you know. It's it's a whole or thing they come out tonight. They come out
They watch you. I mean you've done a lot by now, but walk me through the process of of
Prepping yourself for that and now after doing it for so long
Dude does the nerve still affect you? How is it?
No, the nerves. Don't affect me now. They did for that first show because I had never done this. I have no idea
What the show was gonna be like we'd run through a few rehearsals with no one in the audience
But luckily you know Adam
And I are both pretty good at improving something goes wrong
If someone needs to change we can just do that on the spot
And you start to get really familiar with it
And then I've got a background of doing live performance ever since you know high school
Giving informative speeches and and that kind of stuff in forensics and debate
And so I got the butterflies out like I feel comfortable if something goes wrong I can fix it
Yeah, I feel like I would be shitting like my pants every fucking night
We thought we've toyed with the idea of doing a live tour
And I just I think I would I would I would have a breakdown well. It's too much stress
You might, but not forever. You know I'd get over it forever not forever
No, you would you would learn every night would be the worst night of my life. I feel it you
know I
Disagree okay? I should do it. I like your encouragement yeah, you'll be super nervous the first the second the third
But then you'll start to be like man. I can't wait for this
I can't wait right so it's a fun thing for you. Now. You go onstage you do your thing you look forward to it
It's really fun
I mean it's the same show every night
but not really because there is no script and
So are always tweaking things before the show will meet and I'll say you know
I think that joke would land better if we did this or I think we should change the order or I think we should
Explain that part and then I'll explain this part, and then you can think you don't understand and then I'll pretend understand
It's always really fun, and it's new to every audience right I've seen the show or I'm in it, but every night
It's a new city, and it's new people who were like hearing and seeing these things for the first time
You had said that you
Guys are both really good at improv and so when something goes wrong you feel comfortable picking up the pieces
What's the most dramatic thing that's gone wrong for you guys on stage?
I fall a lot on stage faceplant. Not a faceplant
There was one night. It was in Canada. I believe it was in London, Ontario
where we didn't have the right party fog juice normally we use propylene glycol I
believe and instead we had this oil-based thing which meant that a
Layer of oil formed on everything on stage including before me
Yeah, so you know I danced in the show as you've seen yeah, but it wasn't even during dancing
It was just I was just walking carrying this bottle of acetone and boom slip hit the ground
It was so bad the like I needed to discuss it during the QA and the middle of the show because the audience was like
Okay, and also maybe that was the had to have been scripted and planned because no way the show would have gone on that's not
Even the worst though the worst you ate shit pretty hard it sounds
Yeah, yeah, and I I'm a real jumpy person so when I fall. I don't just like kind of you know fall I go
Because I feel like me that'll be more entertaining or everyone thinks I'm really hurt another I fell and
Though this this was the same the same show with the oily floor
I fall and I feel while I'm falling I think you know what I can save this if I start like breakdancing
Maybe that's what I meant to do right, but there was a stagehand in the way
And I roll into him because of course the floors covered in oil I can't breakdance
I can't breakdance anyway, but I also can't even like get friction with the ground, so I just slide into him and
Killer show that sure we couldn't get the oil out of it, so
Was that a good was that a favorite sure yours it was a really good stage shirt?
That's of London, Ontario you guys were the last ones
I haven't seen any but I'm sure the
Michael are like Dan and Han, can you guys look up if there's Michael eating shit on stage? Oh my god?
No, there's some just like
Dancing and not falling Clips out there. Oh my god. I hope that's up there
I mean that sounds like a hell of a show if I'm being honest
Yeah, they were very lucky. Yeah, they're very fortunate people I again what my next question for you is that?
I'm fascinated by people who do a lot of stuff. Thanks. Matey. Thanks, Dan I
Can't go
I can't get a break people make fun of me because I say fascinating a lot
Like I wonder how they fascinating fascinating and every time I say fascinating Dan hits the soundboard to mock me
fascinating
fascinating
I'm I can't even say it do I get to do I get passes should I get some?
The F word the F word, but the guest won't know what I'm talking about dance err Michael just confused right now
There's no idea what's going on alright. Let's get I'm fascinated
Give me a give me a breakdown give me a fucking pass on this one
by
showman or productive
professionals
Who manage so many things in their lives because I find myself always like
Overloaded and I get flustered and lose focus when I have too much shit
Do you in minefield Vsauce brain candy of the Curiosity box?
How do you manage all these things at once and keep yourself sane and focused I?
Don't and I'm going insane. No. I think what it is is it's um
It's about a great team to help you you know
I'm I'm involved with the Curiosity box and help curate things
But there's a different team that packs them deals with orders deals with getting samples
And I love what I'm doing that's kind of a cliche answer, but like when I wake up in the morning
I want to continue reading about
You know rigid rotational dynamics. You know because I just want to and it happens to also be my job
But if I couldn't do that I'd be kind of like
Annoyed mmm so it's I'm really fortunate that my job happens to be what I do anyway when I have free time
But that also means that I do I ever have free time. Yeah, I gotta take a break you say okay
I'm gonna stop
What do you?
feel like you have free time do you feel you need free time does being so busy all the time how does that affect your
life
It doesn't affect my life because my life was already even before YouTube the same thing
I just didn't have anyone to listen to what I had discovered right I would talk out loud to myself
But then with YouTube around I could just turn who I was into a show a show right and
To get to get bigger than that to do a live show
to do the Curiosity Box to do mine field you have to have other people help and so wonder people work with you and
Supporting you so gosh. I mean there were more than a dozen people on mind field well, and we had a number of actual
psychologists helping with
Pre-production because the first season was classic
Experiments it was stuff that I knew because I had an undergraduate degree in it
And I was like let's just replicate all of these famous experiments. We know the result to expect
and we kind of you know we know we want to do but for season two I wanted to go into what a
psychologist doing today, and how are they doing it so we had to bring in people who were
Career psychologists who could then reach out to different universities and say what are you doing?
What can we help you do we've got
Money, we've got resources. We've got in some cases cameras like an episode that isn't out yet, maybe it will be
When you're watching this
Was about the placebo effect, and how we're enchanted by neuroscience that we believe it can do more than maybe it really can and having
Mine field there as a documentary crew
Made people believe that the study was more powerful than it was because of course it was a placebo study
But it must be something if all these people are here with cameras if this you know if Michael Stevens is here
It must work, and that was all part of of
Planting that suggestion in their mind that they're gonna get better mm-hmm
That's very cool. I'm looking forward to uh how there's another six episodes coming on my field or what's the deal?
I think were six already. I think there are three more
There's eight total and so far five have come out so over the next year the next three will come out
So I wanted to talk about the season to mine field actually
Because you definitely it seems kicked it up a notch
From season one and I appreciate you
sacrificing your own body of mine as guinea pig you dabbled in a little bit season one with the deprivation yeah, but I
Loved the truth serum, and I loved the ayahuasca trip
Tell me about how you guys came up with that deer and I basically I just want to hear like
what was the experience like let me start with the ayahuasca because I feel like on the show I
Wanted to I wanted to hear more about how was that experience for you right because it was fucking it was a weird
trippy thing like it's one thing to take a psychedelic and hang out with your friends as another thing to hang out in like a
Jungle while some robed man chants while you trip balls and be recorded. Yes. Yeah, yeah, there's like yeah
That's a weird way to do a psychedelic. Yes. Hey guys rather than doing it in like my dorm room
I'm gonna do it in the middle of nowhere
Where no one has cell connection where the only way to get back to a city is by taking a boat ride for hours
Lying there was a measure of paranoia. There was a lot of fear, and I don't think you know we didn't
record a lot of that, but I was really nervous as the date approached because I couldn't
Say no
I could I made it very clear that like look if
We're gonna do this we all need to agree that up until the moment
I put it to my lips I can say no and no one's gonna be mad that we went all the way out there
Because I didn't plan on not not doing it, but I wonder you want to reserve the right. I didn't want to feel forced yeah
And so I said look when it comes to the decision process and what we do and how it works
that hierarchy goes me then the shaman and
Then everyone else
If the shaman thinks that we need to have the lights off if the shaman thinks I need to stop recording
And I can't respond you listen to the shaman yeah, I know he's not on payroll
I know you didn't approve him as a director, but did he get EP credit. I don't know what he got
But he was a great guy. He was also our boat captain. Oh he's uh he moonlights
Yeah, yeah he moonlights with the ayahuasca right yeah
But tell me about that experience because I'm first of all was it your first
Psychedelic experience as far as my mother knows. Yes, of course. Okay, all right. Yes, not watching. This isn't your mother show and
It was ah
Man, I think the the initial emotion. I had before the ceremony was
Aggravation really yeah, because I was nervous
But I couldn't I couldn't do it my way
What was your way my way would have been?
To not have all the cameras there don't have to make a show right and so this is what's going through my mind
I'm like hanging out in the hut waiting for the shaman and and his assistants to come and get me
but I can't just get picked up and then taken to the
The the ceremony we have to like do multiple angles and take the experience couldn't be authentic it was it was totally authentic
But I had a job to do during right yeah, that was the hard part that I couldn't just completely
Surrender myself to the experience as me
I had to be Michael the host of mind field right I had to listen to direction like ooh
you know what we have to do that again because
This light was in the wrong place or oh we need to get the coverage of the shot of you entering and I'm fine doing
that but I had bigger things on my mind and
colors and shapes well
I didn't even know what kind of colors and shapes are gonna be it was frightening
Okay, so then we've got a crew of people right
We've got something like eight people there
And they've got microphones all around and usually you do this in the complete darkness
That makes for a terrible show so we had to have lights installed which made me really self-conscious
because not only am I being watched and surrounded by people you're expected to perform, which I can only imagine would be such an
Awful feeling while you're tripping right okay, so expected to perform was another concern
I had so I also made it clear that if if I do nothing, but lay there catatonic leave for eight hours
You're all gonna be happy a speed. Yeah. Yeah, because I don't want to have any responsibility or obligation
Because you're in a different state of mind yeah, and I can perform. It's my career. That's my job
I'm used to that in this state of mind right if I get hangry or grumpy or happy I can still do those jobs
But I wasn't familiar with what it was like to be in the state of mind that DMT creates
So luckily we had all that figured out, and it wasn't that big of an issue, but I felt really
Unhappy that I had to have all these eyes on me
And and then as the drug started to take the effect I felt feelings of guilt
Here I am I
Was paid to fly to Peru to take drugs and only I got to take them no one else on the crew
Had signed the right insurance paperwork
Or would probably be able to do their job properly if they had also taken it so it'd been interesting though
It could have been interesting maybe for the season three the boom
Yeah
I mean the shaman drank some okay. Well you would do that, but when you took a dose
I was like were you a little concerned when you saw the shame and dip in yeah, cuz I was thinking wait
I thought you were your my god over me you're my guide, bro. Yeah
But let me let me tell you this
in
The the effects got stronger and stronger
my feelings of fear and guilt and and cut the the self-awareness of all the cameras on me that every motion I
Did was gonna be caught and if I sat up they'd have to reposition cameras?
And I'd be aware of that and what if it didn't work
What if they needed to give me some kind of direction and I wasn't in the right state of mind
I've intial II realized hey as
annoying as it is to have all these cameras around if
We didn't have the cameras here there wouldn't be a show and I'm doing this for the audience
I'm doing this for Robin the researcher who was there mm-hmm
It's not about me all of these concerns about hey guys stop walking that noise is frustrating or stop asking for the coverage shots
That's my job. It's for everyone else. This is not for me and
Starting to think about I need to just give Robin. I come come do the the the
EEG scan I'm ready for that I didn't want to but then I realized by allowing you to do it
I'm giving it's not about me and what I want. It's about what everyone's here for so that's a lesson. I took
That from that afterwards citrus in yeah
How that's interesting that makes you think about?
When when something is your hobby, and then becomes your job, it's kind of like it's not so much about you anymore
Yeah, that is kind of profound. Yeah, exactly
Did you you've you felt that on a level that you hadn't realized before yeah, I mean, I literally
envisioned myself as this like
Waterfall that's just offering
Its water to the world
And I'm like I remember sitting there going at some point Robin has to come over and give me a series of questions
He's got to put this thing on my head and measure the electrolyte electrical activity there
And I could say no and I planned on saying no until I realized the way to get rid of all that anxiety
Was to just say let's do this I am a vessel for your research
Were you concerned from the beginning that you weren't going to be able to perform that?
Hmm no, I wasn't really couldn't because I figured even if it all completely is messed up
And we don't get everything right that in and of itself is whatever happens is good. Whatever happens is well
how did the experience meet match up to your expectation let's let's let's
Let's just assume that you've taken other psychedelics. Let's just imagine a world where you have how would that?
Hypothetically compare to your experience well
It's it's different for every single person
But anxiety was my biggest fear because once you're you're once you've drank the ayahuasca
it's you're you're on the ride like you can't take the antidote right you know and
The first ceremony was really Pleasant and and quite low in its dosage the second one within 20 minutes. I was like oh
No you took twice as much as I recall you took like a third of a cup the first time and then
3/4 of a cup that's right. Yeah, yeah, and
It happened so fast. I had lost control. I no longer was like observing
What was happening things were just happening to me right and?
My heart started racing right we had a medical doctor there, which normally you don't because it's not dangerous basically
but
YouTube requested that we have a yeah
Yeah, and so I was but here's the thing my heart was going. It was literally beating very fast
I actually there's a moment where I touch my chest and I'm like yep
It's really happening, but then I thought how do I let the doctor know?
Because I can't think no this is not how I normally feel is it weird if I just say hey um help
How are they going to interpret that and so I just I thought maybe I'll just ask for water
You know maybe that like will tether me back down to reality because someone will have to bring me water
And that's a really Mundus is so I've been that like I feel like I've been in that headspace of trying to like
You're stuck between like
the ethereal world and the physical world and trying to make sense of
Being on another in another place, and it's frustrating. I hate that. It's frustrating because I was probably
Most consumed not by anxiety, but by the feeling of how do I?
Relay and describe what's happening to me later. You know because that's what always annoyed me about
Discussions of psychedelic experiences is that it all felt really vague and
Hard to empathize with and now I I mean
I I know why it's it's like describing colors to someone who's never seen it's a completely different state of mind right and
So I I every a psychedelic experience I've had
I've hated it. I don't know why would you say it doesn't sound like you quite hated it?
But it seems like it was marked with some negative feelings
Might yeah, my experience always have a lot of I think my problem is like I'm too anchored
I never really let go and you're always like resisting the urge to just kind of float off
And you're trying to hold on to the earth as you're floating to the sky
I think getting over that resistance is there a part of what psychedelics teach you right I didn't I?
Didn't break from that, but I'm aware now of its existence. I know what it feels like
Robyn Carhartt Harris from Imperial College London who came with me?
Didn't say I had a bad trip. He describes. It as a challenging trip. Yeah. You know I like that
I'm still glad that I did it, but I'm not like I got to do it again, and I think that's fine you know
That's exactly it's fine. Yeah
I think I think if you're so that eager to return to that state of mind you probably having some trouble dealing with the
Actual physical world if you're so eager to its embarked out there and and on a daily basis um
I don't know, but I know that
There's a bonus clip where we spoke to a woman who took psilocybin as part of this. Oh, that's like mushrooms
yeah, she took a pill through a study at NYU and
She worked with these researchers for months
And they crafted a pill just for her based on her weight based on her past
They knew what dosage to give her and they I think she felt incredibly safe. She wasn't in the middle of this brand-new space
Therapies for coping with death yeah, she heard death. Yeah because she had been diagnosed with cancer and
confront your own mortality is obviously frightening, but they they
Were experimenting with how psychedelics can help you deal with those feelings mm-hmm and she?
Was it was a phenomenal experience for her? She she tells a story of?
Seeing a table with all of her family and friends, but also death is at the table mm-hmm and she realized yeah
Deaths invited of course hmm and and ever since this happened years ago ever since. She's felt much better
she's she's
You know felt healthier, and she only took that one pill. It's not like just
it's one dose ah
That's that that's awesome, I love that I think psychedelics and and drugs like that really have a
lot of value to our society
It's just it's a shame that they get stigmatized
And I think that stigma itself is what contributes to a lot of the negative feelings you have when you take it
I think so too. Yeah, because you start to feel like oh my god doing something wrong. I'm doing something wrong yeah in fact
I had this thought that cracked me up during that second ceremony where I was like
You know what when the shaman lights the candle and says that it's over first of all it's very comforting because he knows how long
These experiences last when he lights that candle it's proof to me that
The effects aren't only going to wear down from now. I mean it takes a very long time, but they
When you're going down you start to regain control anyway
I'm thinking you know once he lights the candle and like the crews done the first thing
I'm going to say is I can't believe I'm gonna have to tell my mom. I did this and
Such a funny thing I didn't mind obscene it cuz it just felt like a joke when the experience was really traumatic
and poignant, but I
Forgot what I was about to say you were
Talking about the stigma how it makes that oh, yes
I think that if if I was part of the you know Shipibo indigenous tribe where this is a
Medicine prescribed all the time
I would not have felt the same kind of am I a bad ryerson am I am I I mean
This is illegal in the country that I live and I should feel bad that I'm doing this
This is a behavior that only bad people do right and you have that social baggage on you. Yeah, it's interesting
You know I heard about a study that doctors are starting to use MDMA to treat PTSD
so they give you a dose of MDMA which is ecstasy in the pure form and they set you down, and I guess if
It makes you feel more comfortable talking up and you feel more comfortable with the emotions that you're dealing with and so
All these drugs that that I think it's a shame. I really think it's a shame this war on drugs. What is done
III genuinely believe that people
Yeah, I generally believe that people don't abuse drugs unless there's something else going on like people don't just all the sudden
become addicted at drugs
I think all drugs should be legal and people should decide what they want to do
And if there's education and support to help people navigate those waters that we would be a healthier better society in the word drugs
What does it mean because it sounds like so many gangs?
everything from heroin to DMT tylenol caffeine to tylenol right and so we
Have done a disservice to both ourselves and to innovation and knowledge by saying ooh
You're gonna study psychedelics
we really only want to fund that if you're going to be studying the
bad side of them right and only recently has that started to break apart, and we have this now renaissance of
Investigation of psychedelics Imperial College London has this whole psychedelics research group
And that's who what Robin was from who came with us
and so
we're starting to be able to understand more about the mind because you cannot have a complete theory of the mind if you
avoid or ignore
Something that it's capable absolutely. I mean it's crazy that I
Mean yeah, we've tried some obviously by now from the way. We're talking about it and
It's it's weird to see what your mind is capable of
So I was ashamed to do it on like a daily or weekly or I don't I mean we don't do anything now
but we've tried it the
Experience of trying something that is really interesting just to learn by your own
Body people are so there's all these scares like you'd like you take acid once and you lose your mind
I knew a guy who took acid and fucking jumped off a roof or he never came back from the trip like these are these
Are I swear to god?
These are all just old wives tales that are just designed to spook you I don't think that really happens
Yeah, when I was a kid very very very rarely, right
Well two things one when I was a kid. I read the story about the guy who took LSD thought
He was an orange and locked himself in a closet because he was afraid of being juiced and there's no you think oh my gosh
How terrifying and and to be fair, this is a significant decision this isn't like hey
You know what? I should do is invest in gold right?
No, you really you should it's I don't think anyone should I don't have any
Advice or or I'm not gonna
Recommend to anyone what they do it's their choice or maybe the choice of medical professional should make but the fact that you know
HeLa you're like well as you guys can tell like maybe we have done something that
Cajun is we have to have that yeah
I feel bad like even talking about it because some people are gonna say oh you guys are promoting. Oh, yeah
I don't endorse it. I don't recommend it
I think you're like you shouldn't be able to talk about it
Right and like I think like you said it's a big decision to make for yourself
And I don't think that it needs to be caged by law or stigma
I think that there should be open dialogue there should be conversation and like go to a place like
Places in Europe where drugs are legal
And they'll test it for purity for you so that you don't take something awful and die right
Yeah
I can always that you know where's it's some shady stuff can hit me is that drug that shady bad people are gonna own the
Market, it's not gonna be regulated and there's not gonna be anything you're not gonna feel like there's anyone there
Who can help you or advise you through through the experience something I found fascinating
Was that when I spoke with Robin hit him heaven with the den fascinating fascinating?
I
Asked Robin the head of the psychedelics research group at Imperial College London
I'm like so what's your experience with psychics assuming? She's done it?
Hee hee sorry Robin Robin, Robin like Batman and Robin right he goes well. I don't talk about that
My grandmother might see they're such a cop-out, and I'm I'm saying that is that is I?
Was gonna say fascinating like that is you see it's fucked up. Yes. That's like drugs. It's the f-word
I've got all the stigma around they're a great example of the stigma. That's your job is to research
Psychedelics, and you can't say that you've ever experienced them what other scientists does that Oh mom I study gorillas
Oh have you ever seen any Oh, No yeah?
I would never look at a gorilla right I talk to people who have looked at them. Yeah
Or an imagined an astronomer who's like yeah, I've been studying the Stars and the motions of the planets. I've never looked up
Yeah, don't judge me if I don't look up. I've talked to others who have and until we break that barrier
I think we're really missing out on a big part of the human mind. It's a such a beautiful paradox
I think of this guy. I love even on a personal level. He's like no no no I don't talk about them
Yeah, anyway listen. Let's let's roll to a break

welcome to another episode of the h3
podcast
it sounds so wrong
coming out of my house
it was like my dad said it hello
beautiful bastards
here with philip defranco i made that uh
intro in honor of him
uh this episode is sponsored by quip
stitch fix min man crates
and omaha steaks thank you to them more
about that later
next week's guest is vsauce please leave
questions for him on the subreddit
today's guest
because i've already introduced him but
i'm just i wrote this out i require
actually two introductions okay yeah
good
dan mentioned that to me
he got them out just
uh today's guest a man who needs no
little introduction host of the philip
defranco show incidentally also his name
yes that's how original i am he's a
newsman entertainer youtuber
extraordinaire and og youtuber in
addition to being extraordinary i like i
i like that we still use the term og
rather than just like how is this guy
still on this [ __ ] site there's like
five people i still know from the
beginning and right like there's like
smosh the gmm guys
the fine bro is very few right so do
when you think oh gee it's not an age
thing it's just how long you've been on
the i mean the age kind of just goes
with it yeah i mean when we started
there was a guy by the name of oh i
think there were numbers after but it
was like geriatric that was his name and
he was like this old dude that just
shared life stories and he was like the
number one subscribe guy back in the day
really before before it was really
understood what the that's not the
youtube that i know no how old is he uh
he had to be in his 80s
i think that he did pass away
yeah because i mean this was i mean
we're talking about we hope wait did you
laugh
i don't know why
because we're it's like he's a great guy
yeah how can he but i love that he's a
great guy he told great stories he died
i love that geriatric yeah well he
clearly had no illusions about it i mean
his name was i loved it but i loved it i
think him being the number one person on
the side at that time showed really i
think what we've all learned like anyone
can do it like the
the bar is very low obviously like the
equipment's getting better though
everything's becoming more professional
but ultimately it ultimately comes down
to connection stories things like that
and that was infant stage do you still
think that youtube is that same way in
what way today like that anyone can pick
up a camera and make it on youtube as
far as the quality yes i think i think
that i mean if you can grab a phone
what's crazy is you can grab a phone
from like three years ago and have like
decent enough quality audio quality um
and throw it out there as far as people
finding it that's a hard hard hustle
that i don't even know how you do
but it's one of the reasons why like we
we don't do this in every every single
one but we have like a segment on the
show today and awesome we share people's
shorts we share uh people's like
channels that are maybe under 100 000
sometimes over where they where they do
stuff obviously we also keep the
trailers and stuff like that
uh but yeah it's hard like if i had to
start today i don't know how i would do
it it's without a connection it's hard i
mean it was hard even when we started it
took us like a year to get a thousand
subscribers well but then but then you
guys would have like a breakout video
and then it kind of goes from there
there was you had yeah we had a few
breakouts we had several breakouts okay
i would say like several big formative
moments in our growth on youtube one of
the biggest ones probably has to be the
vape nation video though that actually i
don't consider really one of a formative
growth i think the first formative
growth was we had ed a takedown dispute
with uh full screen over a prank
invasion video that was the first time
we were like featured on reddit can i
tell you something yeah i contacted uh
george i think he's the reason why he
reached out to us maybe yeah because i
was like you i don't care if you're on
the right side of this you can't [ __ ]
do this like that's crazy it does like
you can say like we have the we have the
moral no they just [ __ ] stop yeah it
was so petty and ridiculous yeah and i
don't think it was him i think it just
wasn't you just you just you just said
oh
well
sorry
i don't think that it was personal i
think they had something on a piece of
paper yeah when when you end up in these
business meetings what happens a lot of
the time uh and you you forget the
people you forget the community and you
have to always respect that first um but
yeah so there was that but for me
personally i would say would be the vape
nation videos just because or a video
because
i'd really only ever seen your responses
to something right
after something or like what someone did
and that was like oh this is awesome
this is like a whole different thing
that i didn't know it's going to be um
but yeah i don't know
so just in terms of channel growth vape
nation
didn't result in that much channel
growth even though it's the most popular
video oh well on our channel it's a
shame that it's the way it is but on
youtube at least when we were coming up
was and it wasn't by design it was just
it happened incidentally but
the um
the dramas is what you know like the the
full screen one people i think that was
the first time
were introduced to this concept that
mcns were were like had that power right
and that they were abusing it right and
so it became like bigger than than us
right uh the next one after that i think
there was the fine bros that was a big
one for us
there was the sofa stuff
man when we were when we were
beefing was so flow and they were like
threatening to sue us and [ __ ] i
remember like we were in new york at the
time i went to a museum and everyone
there was like i've like we got
recognized so many times that was the
first time that happened everyone was
mentioning those cell phones yes right
and so then there was the cs go gambling
one and then the lawsuit one right so
so i think those were the big formative
steps but i mean there's there was
channels like leafy's is here which and
and channels like him that have received
like meteoric growth
for a few months yeah it was just
unbelievable
and
i don't know that the algorithm would
would lend itself to that kind of growth
anymore unless you're jack or logan paul
because because they did they did have
meteoric growth over this past year or
eliza koshy yeah i was like i don't know
if i should say this but uh
can we mention that we have the same
youtube contact like yeah yeah yeah you
know that he also is the main contact
for logan paul i'm not surprised i was
like that is the best thing i was like
you go to ethan yeah
i love to see graham dabbing right on
the haters you know what's funny he has
mentioned to me you many times but
interestingly graham and yes i am
talking to you and i know you know i
know you watch this you have never
mentioned logan paul to me i i got it
out of him yesterday
he mentioned it and it completely
derailed our conversation i was like has
he given you that maverick merch
and he's like no and i've asked and i
was like [ __ ] logan paul
graham's a great guy i appreciate you i
love you graham um
i don't i don't and i like
i certainly don't want to take away the
achievements of logan jake paul because
i mean they're they're on that grind
right but there's no diversity anymore
like a channel like ours
or even leafy is here which is like a
more extreme version right but i don't
see anything that's even a slightest
[ __ ] a bit edgy even less edgy than
ours ever coming up in the atmosphere
the important thing i think to remember
is that everything's the biggest thing
when it is right and then that sounds
like kind of an empty statement um
i remember when fousey was like one of
the biggest things on the site and i
think he and several other people
thought there was nothing that could
ever slow him down or take him down and
you just you just go like i where i go
i've been here for 11 years i i've seen
like huge jumps before and eventually it
stops right and so that's why i think
it's important for people to plan or
grow or at least try and it's just i
guess you're right you don't see that
everyone but i i will say i mean the
pauls do do that like once again it's
it's very easy uh to talk [ __ ] but
there's they've done a lot of things
very wrong some things well you're right
as far as growth there's a diversity of
content there like the music videos
thing whether you think it's cringy or
not but it's crazy how much content they
produce the amount of views that they
get is just unbelievable that's
unbelievable
um whether you like it or not
the fad of the year was the disney
vloggers and we'll probably have a new
fad
yeah and it's always hard cause you
never know what's gonna happen i don't i
don't know i'm so interested to see
what's happening with with v2 or
anything i don't know anytime there's
like more competition i've heard like
the vine 2 stuff i haven't looked into
it yeah but because i i've i never
really embraced the platform i was on it
a little bit but i don't know it's just
any anything new is always exciting
because it just you're gonna get these
new faces
who made v2 who's behind that is it
twitter what's his name it's the same
guy that uh that just made hq trivia
[ __ ] i don't remember oh is that that
crazy mobile app that gets like 200 000
yeah i mean what's crazy is like once
they start integrating integrating
sponsors and stuff it's gonna blow up
even more i have not used it i've only
ever seen you talk about it what is that
what is it it's uh so at
here's your free plug hq trivia uh
it's a it's a it's a daily trivia app
right so uh i think for us on the west
coast it's noon and six o'clock and uh
they have a host there's 12 trivia
questions you get three options for each
one
and if you get to the end you and
whoever else survives split the jackpot
during the weekend they get money yeah
during the weekdays i mean you have to
win more than 20 to get it so that's
also kind of like the little asterisk
right um because you have hundreds of
thousands of people competing but near
the end
you usually end up getting like 10
to 150 winners um and so you can split
it up but that's just fun it's just like
a nice little stupid break no way you
know you know that reminds me of
xbox live back in the day oh yeah you
used to have this crazy trivia yeah yeah
that everyone was bananas about yeah i
remember it back man this must have been
like 10 years ago
but it was pretty revolutionary i guess
they don't do it anymore but shout out
to everyone out there who knows what i'm
talking about all right let's move it on
a little bit here okay
uh congratulations on the baby boy thank
you that is very exciting i'm a second
baby boy how is he he's good uh we were
saying before he's like a person now
which is awesome he's like the first
three months of baby is just like there
i get i mean i still with this one i
didn't experience it with the first one
this one i'm constantly getting spit on
like spit up on and it's just
as a parent you end up just like going
nothing disgusts me anymore yeah like i
can just see anything and it's nothing
you're just immune like shit's on you
you're like especially because he's my
baby so i'm just like whatever like
nothing's but also like the same day
that happens uh you get different
problems with like i have a three and a
half year old as well he coughed
directly into my mouth last night uh i
was reading him his favorite monster
truck and he goes daddy
like i don't think he meant to do it on
purpose what was your reaction just
because it's like you don't want to yell
like because
it's just
just think about that someone this close
to you
just doesn't give a [ __ ] like just
right in your mouth and he was like oh
so i'm gonna be sick i'm gonna be sick
yeah i uh but it's just i don't know
it's it's it's weird man it's like i got
this little purse in my house and i
always hate when i talk about my kids
because it's what every dad has said and
it's like oh here's the most unoriginal
thing i love them like didn't know i
could experience it uh also uh here's
the thing to anyone that sees my
children is like oh it'd be so great
takes a huge amount of time huge amount
of time if you want your life to 100 be
your life do not have children
i love the choice we made but two done
uh i actually today uh
i canceled it because i have no other
opportunities until like february
uh i cancelled my vasectomy for today so
i could be on this podcast no don't say
oh no
no but now but i mean just be careful oh
my god if i have a third baby it's your
fault let's get that vasectomy in there
because i'm just saying i don't want to
put too much on you yeah i just thanks
for sharing that but yeah i thought i
thought you know i just share those
times
yes
wait well there's not like children
behind the curtain i mean it's time for
them to learn what's up to me it's never
too early no but i was like when i say
two and done two and done uh
like there are so many people like i i
mentioned it off hand to this nurse i
have to
every year i update my insurance and so
i get all this blood work and i
mentioned it and she's like do it i had
a
i
i had a whoopsie baby which i didn't
know as a term uh and her kids are 18 17
and three
and i was like
that's a whoopsie yeah i'm like i'm not
doing that cycle that's what you see
daisy but otherwise great
what's the procedure of a vasectomy are
you scared are you nervous about that
doesn't it hurt at all or is that just
like nip your child well i went in there
and he uh he was very handsy i didn't
know i thought i didn't think the the uh
the what's the word uh the checkout
before the uh the operation was as
handsy and pulley and and he's like well
essentially everything you felt today
it'd be similar it'll be like a little
bit different but you'll be good we're
just gonna nip your chode if you're
showing no and they show you about the
twisting and stuff like that and sounds
but you know what actually it made me
okay with it and it's so stupid because
it's a youtube video is i watched uh uh
rhett and link do it on their video and
they brought a dude cameron video sorry
huh what say that again right link got a
vasectomy
oh yeah no it's on their channel why
talk about marketing
i mean talk about vlogging everything oh
yeah
no how do they show that uh well they
they they have like this little i'm
gonna have to ask them about that
they're coming on so yeah oh about their
children oh yeah they did it together
like it was a it was they hold hands it
was a brodio i think so
yeah i uh that's strange you got it
hey i'm shocked
but i'm also a little bit horrified yeah
but i was like uh i mentioned it and my
my buddy who films all our vlog stuff he
was like i can go right i was like no
we don't have that relationship i was
like
while they were filming they
accidentally went too low there's just i
forget on which which guy but there is
now video footage in the world of just
dick and balls of one of those guys
and that's that's that's next level
trust oh my god that's that's in the
archive somewhere yeah yeah that's like
that's like december 1st 2007. b footage
oh my goodness uh but but what but they
made it seem okay so i was like okay
well okay i guess they're doing a good
thing exactly
so it's it's in and out there's no
recovery there's like a they yeah they
say like you can do light lifting and
stuff like that a week later
one of the one of the other reasons
other than the podcast was uh we're
going to utah in like three weeks and i
was like i'm not gonna be stuck in
inside while everyone's having fun
that's yeah
that's it but so i'm sorry to break to
labor this because i'm just generally
intrigued because i you know
i mean someday i'm going to get my child
snipped as well probably
um
what do you think
they have like this picture diagram
thing it's essentially just a little
yeah two cuts they cut like tiny little
little bit of tube out and then they
like got it and then yeah and then i
guess it just
goes into your throat it's just a backup
but then they say don't have sex for
like a certain amount of time and you
have to you have to just go to town on
yourself for a while
they'd say that yeah well that's
actually the terminology they use
go to town on your song yourself so it's
like
so it's like a pool and then you plug it
up so it's continually it just can't get
through there's like there's tension
there well no because then i think you
would explode if there was actually
the flow i think the way they say it is
it just the body absorbs it i think
that's what it is
yeah it's very the body absorbs it
that's something i should have probably
researched it more
i mean in a way the less you know the
better but that i think that speaks to
how much i don't want to have a third
child
seriously you can just yeah we got this
right we're good okay
i've heard a lot about male
contraceptives that are coming out like
men can take a pill and apparently be
really i mean it's something that's been
in development
the thing is i wonder like what it does

ela you brought us out to New York when
we were like nobodies sounds weird as
hell but you know I know everyone

always been an incredibly generous and
gracious friend to us thanks Dan I
genuinely love this guy I know I it's
been too long now that I am officially
you know guest number eight six hundred
thousand and five just kidding no dude
you guys did it yourselves I saw can I
just say now that was too much I don't
know if I can accept no it's not it's
not enough it's not enough and I want to
say for the record you are one of our
most requested guests right I've been
looking to this looking for this for a
long time meets have you've been hard to
get a hold okay it's not just my phone
I'm just kidding all right I'm your New
York guy you have [ __ ] panic attacks
every time you come in you start every
conversation was like hey do you have do
you hate LA oh that's been a while Bob
do this city
look I don't trust the city unless I can
see its air okay unless you can see its
air yeah no but but is it wait well New
York's not exactly the cleanest place in
the world are you telling me trash bags
on the side of the street with with
maggots it's logging into into the
rivers of the streets is not clean also
I just like saying as a clam by the way
yes
it's also dirty you can't see the air
here though malaria no but I was gonna
say as a qualifier to that I was there
for it's funny because when I look back
on a lot of this like especially like
the vapenation video which is just bring
you up beyond any because I remember the
the day that you went to film it you
texted me and you said hey do you have
any ideas for like funny weed gags and
you were just like going out there and
you guys were hustling every day I say
whatever they want I was there every day
they were just hustling like you know
some new ideas some new things it's
amazing to watch this meteoric rise
thanks you guys did appear so you are a
huge influence on me like even before
like even before we were friends you
were huge influence on me
Thanks and just being able to spend that
year with you in New York like in close
proximity and be able to be inspired by
you was a huge to be around you like
because we played off each other it was
mutual yeah it was it was honestly like
in retrospect it was it was such a great
year a wholesome year for us like it was
only and I think most of our fans think
back on that year is like our golden
years yeah well I you know there's
always like golden years when you're
doing YouTube and yeah I know what you
mean it was for me too in a sense
especially just being it was it was a
fun year but I just it's so funny to see
how big that that vapenation meme has
become and I just remember you guys just
going and doing it it is great now I'm
so happy seems like you're doing all
right for yourself we got some walls we
got some curds trying you know we're
trying to go hustling yeah yeah anyway
it's great dad thank you love you too
both so how is it to be back in LA do
you hate it as much as I grew up here so
you know that's what pisses me off about
la is the traffic oh so we're just
making sure it looks and sound okay but
you can keep going yeah I can you bring
the mic closer yeah thanks sorry I'm new
to this now this would these miners as
if you basically have to [ __ ] suck
Canyon all right it's suck that mic I
didn't know this was part of the
equation here is this close enough can
you all hear me they're saying there's
too much contrast too much contrast what
do these guys [ __ ] stanley kubrick's
Cass goddamn it to professional
operation on transit you got a purple
couch
I thought us coming into a real gig dude
here's it here's a complaint I'll accept
I can't see too much conscious get it
too much get what you mean like in the
in the levels of color anyway whatever
okay um why do you hate Ellie so much I
don't hate LA you Harris used to know I
grew up here you know I it's just it's
it's hot and it's smoggy and there's a
lot of traffic and I think that got to
me over the years so la is a very really
depends where you live yeah it's like
anywhere where do you work yeah yes the
traffic is enough to drive anyone mad
yeah it does if Gandhi lives in Santa
Monica and he works in [ __ ] Burbank
he's gonna drop that nuke yeah I used to
have a job actually in downtown LA
working for an electrical components
manufacturing company I worked the
backend of the servers for the their
Joomla system they used to the backend
you're a programmer no it's it's I
basically just ran their website very
good at it anyways and I had to drive an
hour and 10 minutes both ways like so
two hours 20 minutes total in traffic I
think they just broke me a little bit I
don't know oh yeah yeah I was enough to
break any but I don't really it's this
Amin it's like no but it is like
Vietnamese like its water torture where
you're like it's enough to break any man
yeah I think honestly I just really what
I like I like full four seasons and you
can't get that out here that's very true
yeah but I've invite or the street where
we lived there's like a couple of orange
leaves like on the street and I'm like
oh my god it's full no right like take
my [ __ ] actually sometimes yeah
sometimes I go back to my hometown and I
see there's a little bit of a fall yeah
it's not a bit it's a muted fall you see
a couple get your pumpkin spice yeah
what do you like about New York cuz you
are a very genuine New York guy people
think about you're a New Yorker New York
has an energy unlike anywhere else and I
think part of it comes from the fact
that it's a diseased [ __ ] right
probably you think you have
really the the allure of New York is
part of the it's it's um how hard it is
to make it there if you can make it
there you can make it anywhere there's
an allure to the city but I think the
more you live there you start to be like
well actually I think it's just coated
in in what they tell themselves to make
it through the day yeah I think part of
it is just you know putting yourself
through the struggle of making it in New
York it's but you know I'm older now and
I I've moved out to Queens I know for
any of you Manhattanites out there
unthinkable getting to that point when I
try to move out it's fine big yes big
for you we lived in Manhattan yeah and I
felt like I only went to Queens a couple
times my whole [ __ ] year there I know
I got barely left Manhattan and a couple
times that went there I was like this is
great yeah it's all right yeah
Queens is nice where did you go like a
story uh yes yeah I don't even look down
I look around I look like deep Queens we
did a guy I have family there [ __ ] yeah
well I'm like in a house now it's
detached and has no one oh my god
grown-up boy now are you still living in
town houses but I think like I wanted to
blast honestly whatever you've really
changed I know I told you I'm not the
same old Johnny yards now and driveway
take care you yard yeah well Alyssa
found things I'll go and change some
tomatoes we have a basil plant it's
really nice we have free basil no
seriously this trips me out when you go
to play yeah in church we had about
gardening it's so it's like a self
explains it's obviously stupid but like
I don't have to go buy basil I have free
baby yeah we bought it from Jose and we
used all the basil from it and then we
said let we need to nourish this child
badly we've destroyed him and when he
said nourish him we planted it in a
little open patch this basil plant we
bought from Trader Joe's
you okay so you meant Trader Joe's you
just called it Jones yeah this is LA New
York yeah we do but it's not Joe's there
we call it then I'm like a mess I'm fine
now yeah what they call Trader Joe's in
New York is I'd rather [ __ ] it and kill
myself this stand 50 minutes to buy a
five pack of tomatoes you know it's so
funny because we always we always were
like talking you know having that we was
that nice not that long I got super fun
rows like the line it's longer than any
Trader Joe's just want a chocolate bar I
wanted to have you been to Joe's in LA
well yeah I mean I grew up here so I see
you about goes here Oh Joe is great you
go to Joe's the parking lots full you
look man I can't I have to wait like two
minutes to find a parking space this is
so full you go inside there's like two
people max at the register like that's
full capacity here you're the Trader
Joe's in that broth side we used to shop
I swear to [ __ ] god you guys would
think that there was a famine and this
was the last tomatoes on earth you
shelves are empty
he's not joking there's a there's a
sneaking lion-o sometimes out of the
bill do you just to get in there's a new
building there's a guy bro holds a sign
that says this is the end of the line
just so you know it's because you
wouldn't believe how long but I have to
say there is one thing I will give it
credit for is that cashier system runs
really quick right it's fast
I got it I got it it's bad I got it bad
well at first I was like there's no way
I'm ever going in there and eventually
we caved and I'm like you know it's at
least half the line it looks like at
that speed I agree
but there's still something humiliating
about saying there were a bunch of
[ __ ] it's like man yeah and then you
remember like the rent you're paying in
your apartment you're like what am
paying a lot to stay like this long what
do I do I understand the complaints but
I will say for that time that you lived
there the Upper West Side is a magical
place bro I Love New York's great
walking outside
we were like literally two minutes from
Central
yeah you know man it was underneath our
apartment yeah it was close it's cool is
that what called the bucks no clucks
Ellie's changed you man
did I just grab a couple I grabbed the
bugs gonna head up jealous again it
makes you settle in for the night
it's fun to live that bohemian life for
a while but then you yeah I had to park
my car in a garage next to my house and
it costs like I'm not gonna say you say
because I know and I'm fat and I ran
nobody is gonna respect me after they
know how much it takes to park my car it
was eight hundred dollars a month to
park I thought it was fun I had no
choice I had no choice unless I was to
move that thing across the street every
like Wednesday or whatever it is sweeper
yeah I New York City all you need to
know is that it costs $800 per month the
park you're [ __ ] paid that parking
wasn't even that I don't even want to
use it because it's so far to walk - no
that was my old parking spot no no I'm
doing on my street it was actually next
to my townhouse that's and that's why I
just said screw it I'm gonna pay a
little bit more because it's [ __ ]
you know and I'll tell you I'll tell you
the funniest thing about this place is
you pay that much right and when I
called them to get my car every time
they'd be like man like can you give me
like two hours notice
I'm like just that's all you do didn't
they crash your car once I got I leased
a beautiful baby green Mini Cooper that
was my first car I ever leased I never
liked it and I was so happy with it it
was brand-new and I did in that in that
garage the one you're talking about the
far one and I got a call and I got it's
a bit of a problem here and I'm like
what do you wanna do some what do you
mean a problem I come there and they
have somehow totaled my car in a parking
lot it was the whole side of the car was
completely couldn't open the door
smash and I had to had to go through
like a big battle with them and they
never ended up paying for it I just had
I remembered that they were an answer
your phone no they wouldn't answer my
phone cause I call them hundreds of
times and so I just said screw it I just
want my car back so I paid Geico the
deductible thanks guy go well sorta
that is some of the [ __ ] you dealt with
that year would have made me lose my
mind that was close man like um on top
of paying some spineless [ __ ] some
[ __ ] [ __ ] $800 a month like who
even has the balls to ask that it's just
the free market goes I know I'm kidding
I'm kidding but nobody you paying
someone so much money just for the
simple act of saying here you goes your
car and I know I can crash it and don't
take responsibility I I you know I can
get it i I've come to Zen not coming
peace with that
I'm sorry bringing it up it's like in
the moment I remember going there be
like you're gonna pay for this car it's
just gotta buy things are just not going
to and it's gonna stay broken until I
fix it what did they do what are you
gonna do and they know what are you
gonna pay a lawyer I know that [ __ ]
you're gonna end up at least five
thousand dollars just to write him a
letter we were there do you know do you
know what ended up happening they
resented me after a while like every
time I come to they give me like this
this side stare and I'm like you broke
my car wouldn't fix it why you mad at me
so I moved that's that's one of the main
reasons I moved it to be here an Eiffel
episode straight up New York to the
second garages credit they didn't wreck
my car in a parking yeah somehow oh that
oh you're gone you gave him the chance
they didn't ruin it
oh yeah I was actually that one for a
while but now I'm out in Queens and I
have a driveway that's a great
development I'm really happy about that
for you so let me ask you about the D
monetization [ __ ] going on YouTube is
like yeah the talk of the town yeah I
don't want to like beat a dead horse I
think everyone know I'm scary about but
I'm curious if it's affected you funny
thing I've seen you know like I like
even like you know like PewDiePie I've
seen had some D monetization is using I
think have you guy said oh yo yeah yeah
I've never been hit by one I'm like the
only seriously green oh I've never been
hit by one but I said is pretty
incredible and I and I've been trying to
speak out in as best I can retweeting
like you guys well it's hard to care one
like no really I really do care I think
it's terrible thing they've done but
like I I've been trying
I think it's all that close to you both
sorry yeah I'm sorry this thing's like
it's got all kinds of moving projects
like that cradle it the thing is I just
want you to be comfortable yeah I'm
sorry I just I'm not you feel free to
like get weird with it like you can
bring it with you like Danny same time
but dance for your enjoyment okay so um
so basically what I'm yeah no no I cared
a lot about it
the the only thing is I mean I didn't I
just wanna make a video about because
everybody else was you guys handled it
well enough I don't need my opinion on
it so but you know I was trying to get
the word out there but no just it it
didn't hit me I thought it was really
interesting I thought it was ridiculous
what what they were doing with that
because the thing the thing about
YouTube that that really I know it like
you said speeding a dead horse that
really pisses me off is they don't tell
us what to avoid right right they don't
give us any sort of warning or anything
and like that now they have this manual
review system but I remember there were
a couple times where I had explicit and
this is just a whole different issue but
like I had explicit permission from like
a movie company to review their movie I
would and they D monetize my video
because of copyright or something and
then I go do the review thing and I'd be
like here's the proof and they'd be like
denied sorry and I'm like are you
[ __ ] serious did you ever contact the
company uh you know I just was like
watering the bridge I don't have time
for this bro it happens yeah yeah that's
I mean I'm happy that it doesn't affect
you that is kind of an encouraging and a
way to know that people are getting hit
cause it seems like everyone's just
getting bombed on but maybe it's great
as I mostly just do Lane I just like do
like what's the last video I did flex
tape turd I'm surprised to hear ducking
was family-friendly I mean your your
content generally is very very clean
yeah I guess it's clean I like to keep
it fun and I don't I guess I don't talk
about like current events and stuff
we've seen like people with very clean
content who still get the monetize it's
just god bless yeah yeah in the Boogie I
saw some apple boogie if you're watching
buddy what's up uh love you hey Shh yeah
you don't want yeah oh the really big
dig I'm kidding that's usually just how
you start thank you
I love it but no it's just I love you
and I love you anyways the the I saw
that like some of the original like do
you member like the old Boogie videos
like the Eric the Frances the Frances
stay of course yeah
and that was like getting hit and I was
like yes it's classic you do this what
built YouTube modified it's like
revising histories with yeah yeah and
then there was this recent add gate with
I don't know if you saw it though did
you see that weird I don't know I've no
such it huh Elsa gate was it Elsa it was
that weird like child bro I've been
talking about that for so [ __ ] long
maybe a year since spider-man and Elsa
now it's like it's been there I'm kind
of I have mixed feelings on that because
I feel like I gave them I made 3 videos
about that a year ago and I feel like as
a result they were just like [ __ ] this
guy talking [ __ ] about YouTube do you
think I don't kind of our channel got
shown there's no question about it like
a year ago
when we were in LA for a moment our
channel got [ __ ] I do remember you
guys were like upset about it it's
better it's better now yeah they change
they change some of their policies that
are way more fair now and to their
credit but now they're acting like oh my
god this huge problem about [ __ ]
pedophiles on YouTube who could have
possibly known that but it was even
weirder than what was talking about it
either no cuz I feel like the other one
was just like kids videos aimed or like
videos aimed at kids that were weird
sexual sexual but that's different this
was like this was a whole nother level
this was like possible kids but it's all
connected there was very there was very
sexual videos that we were watching back
then of like you know [ __ ] women in
thongs and like the cartoon I remember
we watched of spider-man tackling Elsa

previously we had a calling system
through discord but honestly nobody
knows what the [ __ ] discord is and you
had to be subscribed on Twitch and we
kept getting like the same temp people I
mean bless your hearts and everything
then would explain and as soon as it's
done people would say wait how I
wouldn't be able to figure it out yeah
so here's the great news danke I
actually don't have the phone number we
have a public phone number so anybody
can call it now poor ian is going to be
on the brunt of everyone trying to call
him but he's gonna sort it out dan can
you say the phone number what is
it we're gonna put it on screen right
now hey sit okay great so call this
number if you'd like to engage with us
in any conversation we're alive baby
this is live should we do it first one
like like yeah let's take a call like
right now so calling
anyway I'm really excited about this cuz
it's like a real radio show now you know
we don't have to you know I've been
going like discord yeah so my head story
today that I want to talk about is in
our last episode with post Malone
we were watching a live stream of
Patrice Wilson's and he scared the
living god out of me for those of you
who missed that episode we were watching
he's jumping into screen now what does
that mean
it's gonna look at calls oh yeah he's
getting water how happy is in right now
so in the last episode of you guys
missed it
Patrice Wilson who's someone we hadn't
made videos before in the past he's a
little creepy guy and they all have a
bit of a pedo vibe so this was years ago
I don't know if the guys actually
diddling kids I mean how could I know
that but it's the insinuation yeah
there's never been anything actual yeah
no I think it's a joke right it's a joke
anyway he's deleted all the chump
videos on his channel started a live
stream with our channel name in the
title h3h3 and it was super creepy we
pulled up the live stream on post Malone
was here and the countdown faded to a
shower curtain a live stream of a shower
curtain a really creepy seedy one and it
was like shots of him walking through a
graveyard it kept getting weirder and
weirder after we finished the stream
there was like him walking in the you
know in a dark Street and like mumbling
stoppage to himself
yeah kill I mean at first I was like oh
this is
but then it kept happening and people
were saying in the comments like you
should probably start taking this
seriously like at what point do I
informed the authorities or YouTube or
so on that this guy has lost a couple of
screws and he's coming after me well I
wasn't I wasn't super scared but later I
think it was the next day he had changed
the countdown because it was originally
counting down like 300 hours till
December first at midnight and so he
uploaded a video on his channel and he
changed the countdown to two hours and
he uploaded this video and it scared the
living Christ out of me
well it's so low that you can actually
see the image on this monitor but it's a
it's a graveyard
it's a looping image of a graveyard and
in the description it says Ethan like
before he hadn't called me up I named
the H THC it could have been incidental
maybe part of whatever his uh and he
added a second countdown so there were
two countdowns yeah one was for that day
which was Saturday the day after the
podcast so I'm sitting at home trying to
relax after a long stressful week and
I've got Patrice's livestream open with
my [ __ ] name and a close-up
reoccurring of a rainy tombstone and I'm
thinking to myself I'm freaked okay if
you don't know what this guy looks like
let me show you who the [ __ ] is after me
this is Patrice Wilson peeking in the
window of a 12 year old girl pretending
to be mr. Rogers okay this is who's
after me writing Ethan in the
description dudes okay
so there was a countdown and it was for
like sometime in the evening maybe eight
I was something about and we were at
home yeah and we kept watching it and
just doing whatever we were doing
thinking like maybe it's creepy maybe
it's stupid and then as we kept going
down it was like almost like an hour to
the end of the countdown we started to
get freaked out it was when I saw my
name in that yeah and I was like you
know what this is [ __ ] up this
cool so I'm like illa get your [ __ ]
we're leaving I'm leaving the house I am
NOT gonna get turned into Chinese food
by this creepy guy that's one of his
videos it's a reference it's a it's a
reference it's a I like Chinese yes
so I bounced and I wrote an email to my
contacts at Google and YouTube and I and
I'm so embarrassed by that email cuz I
was genuinely like this [ __ ] is getting
too weird for me to handle and I think I
titled it something like urgent a threat
against my life like that traumatic cuz
I was like I have one minute to leave I
started getting like spice tingles down
my spine I was jittery freaked out
urgent threats against my life and
they're like what like what the [ __ ]
like Ethan's always been insane I
complain to these guys so much like this
this is too much for me every day
there's an urgent email yeah exactly
channel deleted yeah I won't that's it's
a combination of me being an alarmist in
them actually you know appreciate a
platform but probably anyway they got
this email for me and I think I think I
still have it but I'm like this channel
was making threats against my life and
he's got my name of the Todd and he's
doing creepy [ __ ] in this channel it's
like not very convincing unless you were
in it yeah I can only imagine how it was
received is like wow Ethan's really
losing it I'm I'm really deeply
embarrassed because he's my respect they
send this email to I sent that off I'm
freaked out I'm not thinking I'm we get
in the car we drive to a [ __ ] raava's
parking lot and we're sitting there
waiting out the timer like an hour I'm
sitting in Ralph's parking lot I'm like
just playing there's people around us
right and then I was expecting to like
come out the back seat yeah
and then it came on and he had like a
creepy voice I've got the video up so
the countdown finally expires let's take
some calls after this oh wow we have a
lot holy smokes trying to understand
this okay still screening this could be
our ghost story even though there's no
ghosts of all the treats as the ultimate
ghosts
dan I thought we were only supposed to
have eight College but there's like
thirty here anyway so the countdown
expires I'm sitting in my car in the
Ravis parking lot shittin bullets
looking over my shoulder and this is
what comes on Patrice's livestream
[Music]
meanwhile I'm sitting in my car like you
sit there meanwhile I'm sitting there in
my car like this is so stupid like what
is my life right now like listening to
Patrice Wilson talk about bowling with
the pitch shift on his voice like this
guy got my head Patrice Wilson dude but
anyway I ended up like saying and if you
think that this is about going to
someone's house about trying to kill
them get that idea out of your head you
guys this was a huge drama like the BOD
of us happening through this live with
post has like a million views this was a
huge ordeal there was a whole team of
crack investigators on it yeah that was
amazing
well we'll explain what they found out
but I want you guys to watch this it's
no different than what you see on TV the
violence you see in the wall today you
think it's no different
she watched I love the sound of pepper
Jorge was going wrong the world I want
to find the part where does your brother
film is enough I would not take violence
even in the situation
hey come on get here he goes he's saying
everyone watched and was just thinking
something vulgar and negative when I was
like I was only walking through a
graveyard but somebody's name has made
fun of me in the title I was just saying
there myself stop it and kill stop it
kill h3 I want to kill I want to wanna
[ __ ] Ethan's dead party everyone's so
vulgar jig so I'm gonna wake up in like
a you know it's gonna happen we're gonna
wake up one morning and we're gonna be
inside the dollhouse that that Alison
gold music that it was right peace
inside that'd be pretty cool to see the
set yeah until like all the sudden he
starts Dave raping you everything you
just went up in that video so story
first yes
so I suggest that you keep on digging
finding the clues while you doing it
[Music]
stay positive
anyway you know he's real inspiring and
all that good job good job Patrice you
got me out of my [ __ ] house on a
Saturday night it was the first time in
months I'll say that at least anyway so
yeah I was like he's not trying to kill
us apparently what didn't he say that
mm-hmm to disarm us have the decency to
stay positive
so all these crack detectives went to
work to try to decode this and here let
me show you this the investigators yeah
the investigators let's see they were
like up one Dischord all night let me
read this one of the discord detectives
checking in so since the HP podcast last
night over 300 people joined in the
official patrece countdown discord Ethan
locked the doors and get out and go get
in the parking lot of Rob's your life's
in danger cryptic live stream from
Patrice around 15 of the dedicated
members formed the detectives who worked
around the clock and constantly dug up
the location Patrice was walking around
so he showed himself in the gray very
show himself walking around a house with
ladders and [ __ ] I'm gonna assume mostly
have you seen the video yet yada yada so
these these rain men god bless them they
found exactly on Google Maps satellite
images where in the country it was they
identified all the locations yeah that
he was showing so he wasn't in LA so
that was a little bit of a was a little
bit of a relief but then he says hold on
our original leads were to trap what is
the shower curtain video and what's
moving behind it where was the cemetery
who was walking around where was the
road he walked down where was the house
we walked around for the first few hours
this was all we had but the detectives
quickly found the path he walked down
the house we walked around in the semi
he was at but we couldn't find the link
then Patrice leaked a couple more videos
a girl running through a force being
shot at holding a baby doll and then him
sitting in a dark room seemingly talking
to voices in his head saying stupid
Billy Shh while the negativity brighten
up there's clearly nothing sinister
going on here this videos were
transcribed in the names were researched
for links to Patrice who were Eric Billy
Michael Chris and Matilde were they his
kids his dogs his children they may
never know but there was a breakthrough
they were digging through domains under
his name turns out the guy owned some
really strange ones including my eye
girl dot Network my eye girl network com
what's an eye girl it's a whole new
genre his name also came up on a website
called Sonic media networks Sonic media
networks is not owned by Patrice but is
producing a show for them with a little
digging revealed they have posted a
couple of trailers on Vimeo for a horror
show they're releasing on Amazon called
vantage points couple trailers showed up
they found them it's the same curtain
it's the same girl running through the
[ __ ] stairs you know running through
the woods and there was also a
silhouette of my body it's riddled with
holes and stab wounds every trees
putting his name am i decapitated neck
I've been watching too many minehunters
it was so so was solved and the guy was
just doing a little bit of a gimmick tip
to promote his Horror Show and on one
hand like I don't really appreciate him
using our name for publicity and
freaking me out like that mm-hmm
but on the other hand I guess I owe him
one you know we've done enough for
Christ's sake the guy can [ __ ] make
me think I'm gonna be murdered for one
evening fair enough fair enough Patrice
all right what do we got here we got a
call hello hello you're on there what I
like how you doing I'm doing great we're
doing great we love being a pop
something three three it's very
enjoyable
thanks man cool well
thank you good what is your location
going to be when you see the Patrice
Wilson countdown go to zero okay so when
it goes to zero well tell you our
location I can't I can't say it you know
publicly because that's a security risk
but probably at Whole Foods parking lot
hopefully we'll be we'll be in the
feminine hygiene tile of Whole Foods on
Ventura and no we were talking about
that with with post Malone the guy has
guns he's got guns
he's got swords he's got brass knuckles
post Milan yeah he's got a whole frickin
arsenal and he's got bodyguards who are
Samoan he does I'm gonna be there
wherever that is I'm gonna be there um
why is it muted what's going O
are you there what happened he drops
okay thanks for the call dude oh you
okay apparently okay that worked
Ian you should write their name Yeah
right okay cool Dave's question yeah
thanks for the question I guess so the
new system works just worked I mean it
worked so yeah that's that was the
exciting news for me
so anyway lucky to be alive
you know thankful on this Thanksgiving
Day that I am NOT being captivated
captive by Patrice
so moving on wanted to discuss Black
Friday as today's Black Friday you know
what happened to Black Friday like last
night after Thanksgiving my sister was
like oh they're doing Black Friday at
Target I'm like it's not it's Thursday
it's like people can't even get a break
from having dinner with their family it
used to be that these sores had the
courtesy to wait till the next day but
now the pandemonium
that depravity starts right as you put
your fork down like seriously we went
there at 5 o'clock and there was like we
went outside target there was like
leaves everywhere garbage low blood it
was like bloodstains the police were
there I'm like okay I don't even finish
digesting my food and already it's like
the [ __ ] purge down at Target what's
in target by the way nothing literally
what isn't a target that is worth lining
up for they did actually have this which
by the way they had a it's it's also
blood is not an ad it's just the first
time I switch for sell in any store
that's true the funny thing about the
switch was we were we were just there
mostly out of curiosity we were walking
through the store the switch was a
blockbuster Black Friday deal at 299 is
a fulbright what the hell got is scam
you rotting blockbuster
so essentially what Black Friday has
turned into is retail companies tricking
you into thinking you're getting a deal
it's a great turn nation they're not
even giving you deals anymore we're
walking through Target
it's like TVs you know you save 30 bucks
people are buying blu-rays my sister
went there by blu-ray digital media
digital media still a thing
I got a blu-ray unlike my DVDs are
garbage I don't wash those but my
blu-rays are killing it you making fun
of your sister and I may be watching no
she's not watching I've got a blu-ray
you know in ten years there's gonna be
beaming movies right into our brains and
physical media will be left behind when
we're all shrunk you know what's gonna
happen in the future we're gonna run out
of space and we're all gonna be shrunk
into one inch tall you know like a
that's what's gonna happen and we're not
gonna be able to take our blu-rays with
us is what I mean
you know all the poor people will be
huge the rent the rich people will get
shrunk because they have more space it's
like you just watched that trailer
no it's all the idea from Kurt Vonnegut
yeah there's this movie coming home was
it called something I don't know but
they like oops I'm Matt Damon and I got
shrunk yeah
it's about shrunk I shrunk again Oh No
shrunk yeah but it's about Matt Damon
downsizing down and so and like if you
have a hundred thousand bucks you can
get downsized and you get to live like a
king because everything's so cheap when
you're small to live in all tiny little
world just a little tiny Forks but and
they do not have blu-rays the technology
doesn't exist
you can't have a disk this big
everything else works point is who's in
Target buying blu-rays yes yeah my
sisters hits way to close down so I
wanted to celebrate it I I want to
celebrate the act of stomping on a
baby's face to save $10 on a rice cooker
by showing you my favorite Black Friday
compilation videos cool or not I made my
own compilation this is Ethan's finest
wow you're like a DJ on YouTube
I'm a DJ of pushing Nana down and
breaking her [ __ ] hip to save $2 on a
blu-ray that you won't you will throw
out nice play with I get you got to love
the contrast of Thanksgiving to
Thanksgiving you get around with your
family you're so grateful for my love
for the love I have in my life for my
family my friends I'm healthy I'm happy
and then eight hours later you're like
get the [ __ ] outta my way granny I need
to save five dollars on this television

more than just a guy with a couple
hamburgers in his eyes better since then
you've been just a little recap here but
Rockstar number one on Billboard's is
it's still number one right [ __ ] me like
two months now not for long my mom has
been texting me every time it's playing

I could tell your mom's lovely I was
super cool every time I go to a friend's
house they'd always say like your mom

by the way I'm gonna cigarette since the
last time we hung out but I love our
traditional just why are you trying to
stop no I'm I'm just not a smoker but I
like to get weird and wild you know When
in Rome you don't have like a douche
flute or a mouth for Dora you got a big
one a douche flute it's first of all
okay what would you call the giant babe
I don't know it's got it the Canon has
to be the what's the first trade it's
kind of have more of an alliteration or
rhyming not really cuz mouth fedoras
kind of just I'm have to think on that
yeah it's like a [ __ ] douche pack had
it like a camel back and have it that
thing I don't know if I talked about it
yet was so [ __ ] heavy do we talk
about when we first got out on the
street we had this prop company built it
and then we
out to Hollywood to film and the moment
I put it on I swear to god it's like 80
pounds and the moment I put on I was
like oh my [ __ ] god how am I gonna
make it through this day I saw Dan
coming up the escalator to meet us and
he was like holding it and I was like
what is this guy [ __ ] exaggerating
how heavy this thing is
I put it on I was like I don't know how
I get through this day after five
minutes the strap broke it's just
completely buckled under its weight it
was pretty dramatic day we had to go to
like it was the hottest day yeah you
look great
I feel yeah that's nice that's right I
kept that by the way you should treat
yourself yeah I kept that Queen I'm
waiting I'm hoping honestly I can't wait
for us to go to Vegas I want a gun I'm
gonna wear that now that I have good
shoes yes you always show me up so yeah
I think I think Vegas is like my escape
from the norm because I get to wear fun
stuff I'm gonna buy a matching suit you
guys should if we ever have low be cute
a red-carpet event won't go wearing
matching Gucci track suits is he super
cute you guys are killing it I'm so
happy you're killing it did I tell you
speaking of Vegas did I tell you that
story about when I won like 95 grand
this is a new story I think no okay so I
was in Vegas this isn't like a nice
anecdote I love that no yeah this is a
great nice anecdote from Vegas those are
rare yeah yeah no it's not nice
I beat but it's a great story that's a
nice story but it's not nice because it
just shows the ignorance of me okay so
here's the deal so I go it's like you
know I usually go like 15 grand ready to
go cash ready to play and so I I we were
playing blackjack my mom was there and I
think she was there I don't know if she
was there maybe not
okay so sat down at this blackjack table
right at 14,000
I played it all up and down whatever but
along the way I gave some money to Jason
you know Jason my friend he lives with
me
he's the ER yeah yeah and I gave him a
hundred bucks he lost that hand and then
I gave him another hundred and he
started winning and at that time I was
still playing my like 14 grand right and
so up and down I lost it all I say Jason
give me 100 bucks and then I lose that
exactly I got it I gotta get a return on
my investment and then I lose that I
tell him give me another hundred bucks
and I've that hundred dollar i sat at
the table for 14 hours play had like 50
screwdrivers worked my way up from $100
to 95 thousand dollars so and I said
okay as soon as I get two hundred
thousand I'm walking away gamblers
fallacy I'm walking away at a hundred
thousand ninety-five I was like it was
crazy they had like five thousand dollar
chips I just had a shitload of them
interestingly the more money you have on
the table the less chips it looks like
you yeah yeah yeah yeah there were like
British colors that I started saying at
the British national anthem like LED
lights and yeah so I 95 thousand okay
I'm gonna play til a hundred thousand
went down to five thousand dollars and
then I went all the way back up to
ninety five thousand dollars not how
long did that take 14 hours I didn't get
up I did not move I was just drinking
and every time I would win cuz I was
playing like $10,000 hands and then
doubling the crowd yeah I was big it was
a big time for section oh okay so you
were at High Roller is a scam yeah I
don't like it there act normal I don't
like it there the max bet was like was
10,000 yeah you know what the high
rollers places it's just sad who's like
the press oh it is the person there's
nobody's there there's all these
gambling addicts who come and like lose
their [ __ ] yeah it's crazy it's crazy
but yeah I mean I won that lost the 95
again playing vague and
that's my story but it was it was really
a rush every time I would win like a
hand I would literally take run up and
take a lap around it was the most
intense thing of my life and it was a
lot of sounds like no regrets there yeah
I mean yeah twice
two times two times and I didn't get
that extra five just to get a hundred
and walk away so how did you imagine
walking away with a hundred grand cash
you would have been up on that kiss you
know yeah a lifetime yeah
they would be following you back yeah
they were they they yeah it was they had
like there were security gate like four
security guards they been like knocking
at your door like hello you know we're
so open yeah we gotta come back come on
I do feel walking away were you like oh
I'm sad or were you like that was a fact
it was very but now I look back and I
said hey that's pretty cool anyways it's
a great story a great anecdote great
anecdote thanks for sure that hey you're
welcome
appreciate that dude I'm so sore I feel
like I we started we got a personal
trainers I can't do it looks great
oh thanks Doug he's only done one okay
when is it every day I do it twice a
week I've done it twice I I do it twice
a week it's the thing I've done in one
week but anyway I'm so sore I cannot
even stand up I like this thing of like
where we're gonna get you more muscular
I mean what you're like I can't [ __ ] it
I feel like I'm 19
oh yeah yeah I'm getting serious yeah
yeah after show I need to do like the
like stretches because it might like
these things these groin things right
like the little like tendons right
that's my worst spot because you do a
lot of like kneeling and [ __ ] yeah it's
good exercise it is yeah I mean I'm
surprised I mean I'm so a thick boy yeah
yeah what I mean think what for I never
like I feel old yeah well you're busy
you work a lot I have a living
playing call of duty god mm-hmm you need
to get on it yeah I was talking to you
about that I've never I've never played
caught I never played battlefield or Cod
or any of those console Cod is fun this
one is fun I've been seeing I was
thinking about buying and I saw mixed
reviews almost farmer review [ __ ] well
see the reviews you probably were
reading was like very glitchy right
right a lot of what we're like it's not
worth it by yet oh it is now really yeah
we should play together
yeah geometry wars oh [ __ ] I played like
the first one you have yeah so there's
involved involved
well like okay and the first one it's
just a flat plane and all these crazy
waves right I remember that anyway so
now that it's been evolved and it has a
thing so it's to the three why there's
like freaking trapezoids and pills
you're all and globes is a skewed yes
good yes there's skews there's planes
damn dimension sounds very it's right
really in Ted we had a friend over I
think we must have played it for like 10
hours really yeah really
like Max 20 minute game it's like peggle
so we should play cod or I don't know I
want to play pub G with you but I want
it up so over that game I want it's the
thing that really pisses me off is I
always get killed by some [ __ ] hacker
really every time how do you know
they're hacking because they should be
through three wall I always landed
George Paul and I'll be inside of the
inside of the crate and they'll shoot me
through the crate that's a [ __ ] it's
[ __ ] well there's no Pettit one time
I was playing yeah there's no
penetration know what time I was playing
and I dropped from the sky
and none of the buildings rendered and I
could see through all the walls and I
could walk through walls that's really
good so I so I did you were so let's so
I was it I should have right like I'm
walking through walls I can see everyone
I'm picking everything I'm about the
best gear I'm capping people through
walls and [ __ ] this is just no walls in
the game so there's a dude in the
[ __ ] tree and I'm capping him through
like a ten you know walls and you see
through trees everything nothing existed
I know I couldn't see through trees but
I see him like Oh building you know like
this [ __ ] loser
I lost like two walls and I'm trying to
shoot him and it's a frustrating game I
love the game my frustration comes from
legitimate kills cuz yeah I never know
where I'm being shot from yeah I guess
the answer was hackers the whole time
any time I lose yeah I mean like reasons
why you actually lose is like 1% and
[ __ ] [ __ ] is 99% hackers it's
like a pie chart have you seen that pie
chart
yes it's I live that pie chart right we
should play some though you think you
fun I think God okay I'm Arnie like
third prestige that sounds very
prestigious prestige over look where you
can hang out with all your rich friends
let's do that um I'd love to do that
yeah it's nice it's good even I wouldn't
lead you wrong I want to play I want to
play play let's wrap it up I saw you the
other day you on martha's snoop yeah why
should that I have so many questions
about it because I we mean ela or well I
don't we're thinking a lot about how
shows are made right I'm not gonna say
why
and I'm wondering how people make it
right first my first question is how
long ago was that shot I want to say it
was a long time ago okay
months okay Oh - maybe half a year maybe
mmm Wow maybe five months yeah and so my
next question is when you're there it's
when they like do the audience reaction
it sounds like there's like a whole
stadium of people there there is a lot
of people there is hilarious yeah um
there was a lot of people there would
you say whole stadium yeah but it was
nice because everybody you know did you
get to see the audience yeah yeah yeah
it's nice okay yeah did they cook did
they actually cook their own food and
wait mmm so soup made that fish and it
cooked for you cuz they cut out because
they were like alright snoops gonna make
this fish and put it in the oven and
then oh my god it's done immediately so
you were hanging out that whole time
right well it was more like a uh I'd say
more like a cooking show you know how
like they show you how to make it
already right and then so then they cook
the one that they already made that's
exactly the same as got it yeah so that
was pre pour like pre-prepped I would
say so I don't know yeah okay but it was
they was delightful it was a treat it
was a real treat being on the show yeah
Matt Wendy oh we had that Wendy was
super cool super super sweet
Martha was super sweet she liked my car
though I'm talking about that you give
her a spin make a pass did you stop you
take a pic from psycho you stop short
with my wife oh is that like whenever
that's the mom arm yeah it's a wall in
Seinfeld it's a dad it's like a boom no
no I mean in my life
it's Seinfeld it's like you have a hot
date and then you see a red light and
then you act like you don't see it and
then you slam on the brake to stop short
and you put your hand out okay yeah it's
the same it's the same concept except
without the nod eNOS in short you could
have just stopped short with Martha oh
she was driving oh maybe she could stop
everyone wants a couple e's next I mean
I've got stuff I saw you were in ghost
hunters yeah Ghost Adventures yeah it's
awesome how would that go was it really
spooky it was crazy it was crazy they're
gonna be here we should do like a online
special yeah I love because we went to
that place and it was pretty spooky we
heard that voice
but this that like the things that they
get into is really crazy and they have
all the equipment and stuff like yes
well that guy's the real deal yeah I was
surprised but how's it house a show
called Ghost Adventures Ghost Adventures
it's on History Channel right travel
travel it's the number one show on
droughts on travel and it's on like the
30th the season or some [ __ ] like what
17 now okay I mean how many is there
that many goes well I've been watching
the show since I was 12
Wow
[Music]
is that one of the most surreal yeah
getting to meet Zach and he's such a
good guy and you know he lives in Vegas
so he always gambling have fun and
that's cool and it was super cool used
to ask my mom to stay up late watch
that's the doorman I get to go on it the
most surreal like the celebrity cuz now
you've met so many cool people
what are were the some of the most
surreal like celebrity encounters you've
had where you're like I cannot believe
I'm hanging out with this guy
just a lot of stuff from my childhood
you know what I mean like I got to hang
out with the guys from a band called
Escape the Fate I used to listen to all
the time and high school and stuff and
meeting them was super sick I'm like
Chris drew from nevershoutnever I don't
know if y'all know them but I used to
listen to him all the time and I just
like started talking to him like hitting
him up and you know he said hi and also
one time i DM the guy from Fleet Foxes
Robin Peck mode and that's my favorite
band of all time and he responded back
so just virtual winter dance I think the
most real experience you know getting a
little DM back is meaningful yes it is
the most surreal one I've had probably
is with Steve oh yeah like having
steve-o because before we shot that
video with him he came over to our house
and we were in our living room like

is someone that i've known
very closely
for
over 10 years
she's a close personal friend
and some might even say my wife
technically that would be true some
would say
and spiritually also true
she's my best friend
she's my business partner and she's my
better half
bone
and she's bow in the house she's in the
house it sounded like that he's my best
friend it's my helper my son bo
um
we thought it'd be interesting look
we've we interview all these these uh
interesting prolific characters well
we've got one right here
that we all want to know more about gila
klein's one of the most interesting
people on the internet so we thought hey
i thought let's let's put her in the
seat
ela's not like hey let's interview me
that was my idea
well anyway she's really come out of her
shell lately
and what a big pimp
she's going back to the show she's back
in the show i've been nervous the whole
week about this
it's it it is stressful and i appreciate
you coming out because you are a
naturally very shy person
i don't know why it's nervous to think
of me as the guest like
because usually i'm like the second
you're chilling on the sideline i'm
chilling well you do you have
there was this one great moment and curb
your enthusiasm that i think you really
identified what was it larry said i
identify with everything on curb
but
um he was talking about how when he has
something during the week like a meeting
or a doctor or whatever it ruins the
whole week for him because he knows that
he has to think about that one thing
that he has to do right
like that yeah i relate to that but i
think you relate more
that's why i love it you're the best
well let's start from the top here i
want to talk about some current events
with you all right
now everybody's probably aware of all
this business happening first harvey
weinstein
this guy he looks like shrek if i'm
being honest like like a real version of
shrek he looks pretty scary yeah he's a
and now like nobody cared about harvey
weinstein because he's just some
soulless movie executive and they're
like oh he raped a bunch of people no
surprise but now it came out that louis
ck
was someone that i know you cared deeply
about
has been jerking off
this is this thing he's been jerking off
in front of of uh girls
it's so weird so how do you feel about
all that
i i felt really sad
like yesterday especially when the whole
story like officially came out
i don't know it's just sad
uh
for some reason with someone like harvey
weinstein i don't care as much yeah
it's it's sad in a different way just
said that it happens yeah
but with louie i kind of feel like he
died yesterday kind of feel like
i'm not going to see him anymore like
damn that's true in a way i'm sure
it's just weird what's he going to write
up she's going to write a shtick about
how oh should girls might be my dick huh
he can't do that and his jokes are
always kind of like that like
everyone was talking about how he has a
lot of jokes so like
men are so gross how
women
how do women even get close to men
because they're like the number one
threat but obviously when he says it's
funny right
but now it's gonna be weird
does it surprise you the these things
coming out because it's like a land it's
like a waterfall a landfall
i wasn't surprised at first
i feel like every woman
in a way goes through something of that
sort which is crazy but i think almost
all women that i met
and we talk about it are like not
surprised
but it's it's been so many stories all
of a sudden at once that i am becoming
surprised and then with louie i was
surprised i didn't see that oh louie it
was like not louie like anyone but louie
but he
he did he did write like his statement
about it right which was pretty good i
thought and i just feel bad for him now
do you want to read it i have it
available i mean it's kind of long but
essentially he was like
it's kind of long people can read it but
is you can tell he's really
hurting now from
understanding maybe what he's done maybe
before he didn't understand
he said in his apology he justified it
by saying well i asked girls first if i
could show them my dick yeah but he
acknowledges like the situation is much
more complicated than that so even if
you say yes at the moment
as the lady even if she said yes at the
moment i think the situation is so
surreal you're like with one of your
idols right and you're thinking at the
moment this is weird but i don't know
what to do so you say yes
but later not even expecting him to
necessarily even you think he's kidding
or something yeah but later you can
think about it and be like that was
really [ __ ] up so right
i think the way he did it specifically
because
it's it's one thing to go on a date and
be like hey i've got a weird thing can i
i want to jerk off in front of you but
this was like
he just got off stage
and they were coming about to do a set
or something like in a professional
environment it's when
weird is
do you think that he was going to get
away with it after doing this for so
long and it's so weird and brazen like
how do you think he could but uh harvey
weinstein this is a weird timing right
now
and like kevin spacey is now that one
shocked me too
i the way i see it is like these guys
like
that's it they're done you're not gonna
see anything with these guys anymore
maybe for like 20 years maybe in 20
years you can come back and be like
remember when i was a gross
guy who
jerked in front of people right big
laughter lots of applause he's so brave
it's crazy man yeah
well
rest in peace louie
it was fun while it lasted
i i just it's it's just a shitty
situation i feel bad for both sides
obviously it did something disgusting
that he shouldn't have done
but
you know like
the fact that he put out a good
statement i'm not saying that
that's it we can forgive him sure but it
made me feel bad for him too you know i
feel bad for everyone
it's important because when you look at
how kevin spacey for example responded
that was that was lame he's like sorry i
was drunk and anyway i'm gay
are you like okay yeah gays do that yeah
yeah that totally explains that we all
we all play around with 14 year olds
when we're drunk don't we yeah but it's
isn't it kind of
that was one of the weirdest apologies
ever yeah my god dude
um but louis he really seems to be
grappling with
this new image of himself because he's
not he's different now
his life his image his career it's all
undergone an immediate paradigm shift
yeah
and he's grappling with that and he had
so many things coming out and it's all
cancelled now yeah a movie
that this company put in five million in
that movie for him and they're like
they're apparently not a big company so
it was a big
investment for them that's awful and you
had a netflix special planned that's
going to be cancelled
a bunch of stuff i saw this meme on
reddit that was written as like a
perfect louis ck joke that he would say
if it was about someone else
he was like um
it's a shame that the greatest
comedian of our generation is going down
in his prime but maybe
maybe you should have shown your penis
to a bunch of uh girls backstage without
their consent
yeah
obviously his delivery is much better
yeah but i feel like he could deliver
that joke very well mm-hmm anyway let's
get off this [ __ ]
yikes
what okay let's start from the top here
in terms of of uh
who you are you're israeli i think most
people know that by now what's it like
growing up in israel like i mean us
americans do we take [ __ ] for granted
um
it's a it's like a very general question
uh
yes
a little bit
about what you said about americans i
feel like since i moved here especially
in california
it's kind of like utopian
society
and um so i can kind of see why there's
like this whole arguments between white
privilege and
people feeling guilty and so they're
trying to like correct things way too
much you know
um
yeah growing up in israel is very
different than here
but it's also kind of the same also kind
of the same yeah
well
is it is it awful in israel i feel like
a lot of people think it's awful there i
think people just riding around in
camels and [ __ ] yeah that's not a thing
right
um
it's kind of like here like you just
watch the same shows on tv the same
movies you go to theaters you have a job
you go to school you drive your car not
not camels
you don't
uh when you finish high school you go to
the army that's different than here
that's a huge difference and then when
you're done with the army then you go to
college so it you kind of like
everything takes a little longer than it
does here interesting
um what are the big differences beyond
that
between israel and the united states
um
i think the mentality of people is very
different
here and there um
and obviously the security situation not
not being under threat here
is
it just causes so much like you know in
uh
as a result of it that it's just so
different like
in israel there's always that threat
over your head
but you you just grow up like that so
you're not thinking about it's just what
it is
so when i'm here i can see
i can see how different it is like what
what threats specifically is it that
your
israelis
think about um
for example growing up like if i wanted
to go out or to go to a mall my dad
would be like don't go there's a lot of
people there
like if you go to a crowded place it's a
it's a
it's a threat it's a dangerous spot
because there could be a suicide bomb
there or
it's like a
what do you call it's an attraction for
a terror attack right
it's when you're in a crowd in israel
you actually think like yeah this is
this could be a little bit risky yeah
for me personally
that's interesting because a lot of
people in the usa
sometimes tend to think like shit's not
safe here because they're afraid of
immigrants or yeah that's pretty well
people with guns or
you know
it's pretty strange although lately the
the all the gun
stuff
is kind of
kind of going in that direction it's
still very far like the usa is huge
israel is tiny yeah
um
so
but in israel yeah there's always like
some kind of
there's always a new type of attack
that's happening
and then that that happens for a while
until israel figures a way to like
prevent it right so when i was growing
up there was a lot of uh suicide bombs
like in cafes and buses and stuff like
that and then
like recently it was a stabbing like
you could just be waiting for a bus and
then someone would just come and stab
you
on the street
and so that's
it's but israel is really crazy they
figure out ways to prevent this stuff
like the stabbing was happening for a
few months
and now it doesn't really happen so much
and i don't even know how they have like
their secret ways
say what you will about the israelis man
but those guys are [ __ ] innovative
yeah
they they're figure [ __ ] out there man
but
people who would like to criticize the
army and israel need to understand that
it's a daily threat that needs something
needs to happen about it's not like we
have a choice
do you do you find it ironic when that
like there's these
when you talk about privilege let's talk
about someone who's going to uc berkeley
paid by their parents 200 000 tuition on
campus protesting israel do you find
that ironic
i do when i lived in israel i used to
criticize israel a lot yeah as an
israeli yeah and the army and a lot of
stuff
but when i kind of when i when we moved
here and i started to go on reddit and
stuff like that and just being more
aware of like the online
criticism that and there's not just
online but it's not just yeah i just
became more aware of like the criticism
here of israel
and in general around the world
and it's really
i i personally think it's so ironic like
it's just like i don't know it's kids
sitting here in like beautiful
california criticizing it like you don't
even know what you're talking about
right
yeah it totally i mean it's it's easy
to reduce it's funny because like you
said when you're in israel you're super
critical yeah of the government you're
like dude you're expanding in the west
bank that's [ __ ] you know the
government is turning off water and gaza
doing weird [ __ ] to control uh and make
land grabs and stuff and that kind of
stuff is like yo what are you guys doing
but when you come to israel and then you
what you hear is people criticizing
national security and saying calling
israel like apartheid that they
shouldn't have fences or that israel
should be
you mean when you come here and you're
here right exactly like less let's say
less specific criticism or more general
like
they build a wall and they and israel
should be a one state with palestinians
and israel all living together they
should reduce the borders and remove the
gate that that to me seems like
super ignorant it is because when i grew
up i couldn't really take a bus i was
afraid of blowing up right and now it
doesn't really happen so the wall did
help
so should we not have a wall can you
explain about the wall for people who
don't know about it
i don't know
how to explain well i guess simply it's
like it was built to prevent this
attacks and
there's still a lot of other ways
there's tunnels and you know yeah
rockets yeah
but when we when elo was a kid
there was no wall around greater israel
that blocked out the west bank and gaza
and it was like for i remember in the
newspaper when you were growing up
there was
almost daily right
not daily but it was happening a lot and
it was terrifying yeah on in cafes
and
um shopping malls and buses
and it was just like a slaughter it was
just a slaughter
and so they're like oh let's build a
[ __ ] wall then and and lo and behold
no more suicide bombs my whole time
there
my whole five years living there there
was like one failed shitty attempt
actually it wasn't even a suicide bomb
someone threw a bomb at a bus from the
outside and it didn't kill anyone
so
i don't know it's like at a certain
point you do you know you ha does it
justify like how do you
how do you think about the gazans who
are on the other side of the wall now
who are like
cut off from family members who have to
go through checkpoints and come to
israel you know it's like
the whole thing is shitty
the whole situation there is shitty
no matter how you look at it
so i don't know
i
welcome everybody to another episode of
the h3 podcast today's episode is

two-time world champion 1993 and 1994
those were huge years in gaming
competition has has honestly been off
since that year I just threw my phone it
was making sound it displeased me you
see this he's he's the most ruthless
competitor and the online gaming
community less notably however he's also
a twitch streamer that has exploded in
popularity frankly he's captivated my
heart mine with his violent speed
athleticism and momentum when he first
wife started watching him stream he
would joke that he was 6 foot 8 with a
37 inch vertical leap but seeing him he
is actually 30 and it's [ __ ]
terrifying what else was he telling the
truth about I want this but in actuality
I do think
that he is someone who has elevated the
genre of streaming like until now I have
been experienced a twitch streamer who's
done quite what he's done on Twitch
which turned it more into a performance
part but also being a pro gamer he's
someone who I respect and appreciate and

but but Google is working on some new
prototype scopes with built-in LCD LED
1080p d3 Sony technology don't go into
it right upgraded edition what you're
looking at is a little screen yeah it
just it projects what's outside exactly
it seems a little counterintuitive but
hey it's Google yeah and between you and
I aim assist you're under like Robocop
speed hacks and stuff like that yes cool
listen do you hate this question do you
guys do you have tall guy problems
what have tall guy problems cuz you're
probably one of the tallest people I've
ever met

problems is a real thing right it is it
is I mean I sat in Ferraris can't fit in
them I've sat in Bugattis cannot fit in
them okay I mean this is you know
problems right mhm and for whatever
reason the Lamborghini Diablo VT was the
one and ever since then you know the
it's just little low-hanging fruit shoe
sizes shirt sizes etc but when you were
at let ik mock turtle necks like me yeah
you know spandex material stretchy not a
problem right right right

soundtrack I did until I did it's just
one yeah it's coming soon it's Calvin's
LP yeah are you fan of the show you just
I am a fan of the season one
like season 1 I didn't like the fact
that I had to wait a full entire year
that's the that's what really sucks
about following because I'm a guy I
stream my shows I don't only until
recently did I have cable money right
that's a new thing for me yeah I'm doing
very well right yeah but waiting a whole
year is just uh how do people do it I
don't know and then when you get it a
year later you watch it in one day right
exactly
Wow that's wait another year that's one
of the things that Netflix does that I
hate and love both it's like yeah well
drop house of cards all in one day and
then you have nothing to live for it for
a whole year and thanks for doing that

critics yeah do they sound like that as
well and I'm not Susanna Ron tomato by
the way so what is it 94% oh good news

critics say about you I don't have any
critics everyone just agrees that I'm
the best yeah I mean like everyone just
agrees that I have the best shot in the
game that I'm in the sniper on
battlegrounds the game that I stream on
a daily basis like everyone just
believes and I'm the best looking
streamer on Twitch right really no
critics I don't know I think I'm kind of
perfect okay that's fair yeah that must
be nice well unlike unlike you stranger
things does have some critics apparently
6% of them who didn't like it but um
that first show was great wasn't it
yeah really surprised me Netflix has
come out with some powerful
powerful swings you got like spooky
alien ships and the trailer oh never
heard of it this is great give me a
tough interview the new what's that
movie that everyone loves but I'm
getting a heart I'm getting actually a
lot of criticism for my remarks
regarding it the Blade Runner yeah what
did you think about it I thought I
wasn't impressed tell me the truth
I wasn't impressed because it started
off like this Wow okay I'm into this I'm
diggin it and then it just went flatline
for me consistently all the way through
the movie
I got it we've been kind of keeping this
as a secret I'm afraid to express that's
what we anti I hate it yeah I you know
why I hate it when you see a movie like
that the promises so much yes the
successor to so much you expect great
things
and everybody's sucking its dick about
oh my god it's changed my life
I cried emotional revelation it was
boring
nothing happened dude I was promised
more mm-hmm I agree with you and thank
you for saying that
yeah the Twitter feed blew up and I
heard about it for weeks and weeks and
I'm thinking okay I'm going to the cine
appleís theater where you can grab three
or four gin and tonics and a steak
dinner right and sit in a recliner
leather recliner anywhere you want in
the theater and spend 30 $40 $50 on a
full night right and that's what I did
halfway through the movies right ah yeah
I wasn't impressed visually it was nice
okay yeah visually it was awesome but it
really just and then like it's weird
that people liked it so much because I
feel like in this day and age it's very
I'm I like artistic yes films but this
was artistic in a way that didn't do
anything for me mm-hmm I don't want to
give away the night seriously we have to
keep this a secret until now
this is the first time thanks for giving
me the confidence about that I
appreciate that a lot
means lots of man are you a Nicolas
Winding what's his name Nicolas Winding
ring he's a director of driver
Griffen we had an
Finn I think is Rhett driver yeah the
drive Oh everything yeah drive about
Halle rising
anyways very artistical what do you
think about the guy
awesome he's one of my favorite okay and
he has a very like that movie had a very
similar style to the way he directs but
I feel like it just wasn't pulled off at
that level right of artistical ability
right you know I don't want to give away
the twist of the film yeah yeah but I
didn't like it I thought it was a bunch
of BS and I'd like to explain that in
further detail but I have too much
respect for you guys at home but that
being said get out now listen you are
famous by the way you're not excited for
Mario can I go back to that Tindle I
mean listen I deal with high-level free
a person shooter high-skill open-world
interactive apocalyptic arenas where you
got to be the last guy alive and you
have to kill demolish every one that
gets rails and a hat that he throws that
frogs and becomes a fraud I want to talk
about competitive gaming the highest
level try getting into the body of a
Tyrannosaurus Rex as Mario as he saves
peach from literally being raped by a
giant [ __ ] lizard the stakes couldn't
be higher
okay I'll reconsider
okay Matt you put it that way I might
reconsider yeah yeah yeah yeah thank you
we're getting through there's a lot I
feel like we're having some real there's
a connection yeah except for that
haircut yeah I'm growing it out all
right ponytail or duck tail I was
thinking um what do you call these i
buddycall Hornitos
curly sideburns but they're not
sideburns they're right you said
pigtails would be up here that's what I
want that stuff right yeah that's done
you so you are famously the blockbuster
video game champion of 93 and 94 next
two times two times yeah not one year
and then sec six seven years later
back-to-back back-to-back consecutive so
can you tell us a little bit about those
two years how did you overcome it what
games were you victorious and bring me
back there sure absolutely obviously it
starts at a local local store right so
what kind of store was it just a local
blockbuster store and we're all we're
all good epics begin and just demolished
Sega Genesis all the way through to the
end second year it's when they actually
had location and a finish line my finish
line was marine world in front of the
killer whale exhibit that's where the
finals were played finish line the
finish line meeting at the end of the
tournament meaning that's the grand
stage the championship station yeah yeah
and so you know we played in be a gym
judge dredd Sonic the Hedgehog good old
classics yeah yeah so you had to not
just be a like a pro on one game you had
to be multi-talented this was a
triathlon this was a triathlon
interesting yeah and they had 250 tube
TVs lined up squares squares because
they didn't have I didn't have why back
then Oh No
yeah and a little-known fact anybody
that because the last game that was
played in the championship NBA Jam
anybody if anybody knows that if you if
you play NBA Jam by yourself it doesn't
switch at halftime
meaning the direction that you played a
game so you're always trained to go
right and when you go left all the
controls are actually reversed that's a
little wacky and so in the championships
that was the big sort of dilemma is that
who gets the second you know who gets to
be first player who gets this be second
player mm-hmm and so that's where I
worked my magic so I knew this right I
stayed at first player all the way
through to the finish right yeah yeah
and that was that that was the end
that was the edge and that was the end
trophy in the room I don't talk about it
it's under wraps so it wasn't
necessarily a skill victory is more like
a hold down p1 victory it's it's a skill
victory okay I understand I'm gonna get
the facts straight it's a historical
moment yeah I made JFK just they just
cleared all the documents for that so I
feel
this is something so how did that go is
that a is that probably somebody killed
him I was all in the documents somebody
killed him okay
some guy had a gun he shot him I was
like wow the truth is out there man
actually I don't know I don't know man I
don't trust anyone the internet you've
got like people on art Donald people on
our conspiracy people on like socialism
all like picking little berries yeah
apparently there was two shooters
apparently I don't even know how it's
related but the CIA was like you know
doing some [ __ ] somewhere you kind of
look like you could fit I'm the I'm the
one-time JFK assassin and I say that's a
joke I have no intention of
assassinating any presidents living or
dead sometimes you just gotta clear the
air though I don't know what do you
think happen at JFK I don't know did you
know the moon's made out of metal that's
probably true like technically true
right that's what I've heard I've heard
they record sound waves I told you that
I well I watch a lot of ancient aliens
Yeah right
History Channel exactly is that where it
is yes they're like I watched you don't
even need to say that I watch a lot of
History Channel that sounds credible
yeah it's a hundred percent the moon is
made out of metal okay so can I mean

totalbiscuit the cynical brit i've been
a fan of this guy for a long long time
ever before I ever even made a video on
YouTube I was watching I was playing I
was obsessed with Starcraft 2 and that
was how I found out about him because he
was a shoutcaster back then those were
those were
ARC days for me as ela recalls masters
consumed my whole life but we'll talk
about that when the man himself joins us
so please if you would welcome
totalbiscuit to the podcast have a seat
god bless you thank you thanks for
joining us this is how it's supposed to
be done isn't it we want to lay down on
the couch we've got like a little there
now I know what happens in Hollywood
we're working on pitching a show and I'm
wondering I have not raped enough people
I mean so far I'm at zero right well I
mean this is oh it's a good number to be
at I'm just thinking I don't know some
more though you it's kind of thing you
need to get started on earlier okay I'm
behind I got a lot of people in
Hollywood that are just way ahead of the
curve when it comes to that absolutely
yeah actually let's just talk about that
sure why not nice and easy
yeah why does everybody rape everybody
else well you know it's a good question
well I wasn't uh raped what is it rape
what's ready what's the deal well I
wasn't almost kind of surprised but it
seems like this Harvey Weinstein thing
has really brought out a lot of dirt
right it really does like it seems like
God knows how long this has been going
on for and people calling on an open
secret but how much of an open secret
can it possibly be if this is what it
took to get people to really talk about
it it's like this is obviously been
going on for a long long goddamn time
he's been at it for decades now sounds
yeah I can't be the only one it's it's
it's completely blown my mind as I've
seen the list of women and not just like
secretaries and colleagues but like a
list the biggest celebrities female
celebrities in the world are like this
guy sexually harass me I was like oh my
god one you can never think of right
what's our lean ahead Lisa
recently about it like good lord that's
it's ridiculous and you know you even
see people like Terry Crews coming out
and saying look you know this is a
culture of this in Hollywood and it
applies to women and to men it's yeah
that's the weird one yeah I started that
Quentin Tarantino said I knew enough to
do something about it and I should have
done something and he's like that's what
a lot of people are saying noted on
something about it's like yeah and I
have to wonder like why didn't you I can
get why an aspiring actor or quest were
supposedly with him yeah a lot of stuff
it's in a way though and in a way it's
like it's refreshing I know he [ __ ] up
right but it's refreshing to see someone
being honest about like I should have
done you up yeah exactly
nobody's saying that that is that way it
shows that it's actually a [ __ ] up
situation they're like more than you
think because people know about it and
let it happen
yeah they did and you can understand it
when it comes to an aspiring actor who's
like look this is how it is this is what
I need to do to rise in the industry but
you're looking at people like Tarantino
you know the kind of people who should
be basically untouchable
yes who were in a position to do
something about it didn't you know you
got the whole whole jumps yeah that they
really are you know that complicit by
the silence if you have a if you're like
good friend and colleague is you seeing
them every once in a while like you know
acting inappropriately it's like at what
point do be like intervene it's it's a
sticky thing I think most people didn't
understand the depth of it too because I
heard anecdotes of women being like him
saying don't tell your manager
don't tell your agent don't tell anyone
about this that's like holy [ __ ] it's
great yeah some good certified rape yeah
a lot of thoughts what do you think do
you think that the power of the position
made him more rapey or do you think the
position is what he was already a rapey
guy and the position of power is what
attracted him to go there that's got
it's hard to say in it you know there's
all idea absolute power corrupts
absolutely but there's got to be
something wrong with you at some point
you know because there's got to be
plenty of people that do not do that I'd
like to say so you think like the
thinking out
of faith in humanity left by I hope so
sure you'd like to think that there are
not people that do that despite having a
position to be able to do that yeah so
you know it sounds like a guy was a
piece of [ __ ] and if once you go into a
position where he could be a piece of
[ __ ] to more people yeah and then have
other people cover his ass which is in
itself even more disgusting the fact
that he could do it for so long and so
consistently and just think that he was
gonna get away with it it's pretty
incredible well I mean for how long did
he did yeah you know he pretty much did
the culture of Hollywood enable them to
do it when you go to the UK and this
[ __ ] is one of the most disturbing the
story of Jimmy Savile Oh God who was on
face value the creepiest looking person
alive dude for an ounce he like Samuel
anoints Sabol I've said that I heard it
recently
yeah definitely jimmy savile but I mean
we all grew up knowing that guy cuz he
was on our TVs where he's creeped out by
him as a kid or did that a little bit
there's always something a little bit
off about it I mean I'm gonna pull up a
picture for those of you don't know but
this guy
well you this guy was a child
entertainer beloved by the whole country
yep and basically immediately I mean
look at this guy [ __ ] kids you know
he's beaten raped a twelve-year-old girl
during a secret satanic ritual now this
is a guy that o wore less little red
spectacles and had a giant cigar in his
mouth like it was a larger-than-life
children's entertainer and apparently he
did that and he also chanted hails that
bear might this is on the Express that's
not a tabloid like that's a real
newspaper in the UK that's something
well respected telling Jimmy Savile was
involved in a satanic child oh dear oh
dream stone that was really disturbing
it was fun while it lasted that's so
anyway as soon as this guy passed away
apparently all the sudden I was like oh
yeah that was the most evil man alive
but he never he never had no one who got
his whole life ya know what no one ever
about this
he's untouchable goddamn untouchable
yeah I was in the era of you know kids
that grew up watching that guy and we'd
never considered that apparently we're
all really bad judge as a character yeah
oh well so I want to start by talking to
you about
well I found you through my love of
Starcraft 2 and I love that you're
wearing the Starcraft 2 hat yeah there's
gonna be some one that continues to
represent that game cuz nobody else does
well I stopped watching a long long time
ago I mean I must have stopped playing
or watching it nearly it must have been
three or four years ago yeah
Elite or before we even got married so
must've been over five years ago but I
found you through my love for that game
and it's just really surreal to be
sitting with you now because I was
making videos or I was not worried yeah
you in the grand scheme of YouTube you
started relatively recently yeah there
are youtubers in the world yeah kind of
that's kind of true yeah but now I just
want to because I had kind of a falling
out with Starcraft yeah and a lot of
people did at some point I'm just
wondering like do you think that that
game was the rightful successor to brood
war and Warcraft 3 and the large like
the legacy that Blizzard had built with
like strategy competitive RTS games I
mean I think it was but I think like
Starcraft 2 is very much a 2010 game in
2017 it's the kind of thing that if they
took another look at it and took another
swing at it they probably would not have
made the game they did you know but back
then that was absolutely the right game
to make and if you go back to a brood
war in particular and you can try that
now with the remastered version you can
see how goddamn hard that game is it's
impossible basically the possible play
well and a lot of people are fond
memories of Warcraft 3 but they probably
have fond memories of the campaign
customs and playing dota and win them
all and tower defense they don't have
fond memories of playing competitive one
versus one you know and if they did
they'd know that that game was just as
hard right
oh it's it's about making a game that
has like seemingly infinite depth and
then trying to get people to continue to
play something like that in 2017 that's
really hard to do
I mean dota and lawl are still really
hard games right but they're the barrier
to entry is kind of a lot lower you just
gotta control one dude yeah make him do
a few different things you know the
whole freaking army I mean right someone
describes Starcraft recently is I think
you're the commander but you're also the
troop trainer the logistician the guy
who orders the ration packs the guy who
orders the spare underwear for the
soldiers like your everything you're
micromanaging every tiny little part of
everything in that game
and it's too much for the vast majority
of people and I don't blame people in
the slightest for that interestingly I
found Starcraft 2 to be the probably the
best spectator experience I ever had
from a he support particularly good for
that's like people maybe you've never
watched it before I think that it's a
really complicated thing but I was
liking it too this idea of kind of
watching a sports game like a field game
like football from up above right you
know you might not know what damn thing
about football but you know if that team
is on the other team side and has the
ball they're probably doing pretty damn
well right I think that's very similar
with Starcraft neither you red guy and
you blue guy you blue guys got a big
army and red guys territory and stuffs
exploding yeah you know he's probably
doing pretty well I think that's
actually surprisingly easy to understand
and then you throw a couple of good
broadcast yeah Broadcasting's scene was
great yeah it still is for the guys who
are still around you know a lot of
people went and did other things but
we've got some old-school guys who are
just very very good at their jobs you
know so is it I wonder is it the fate of
every eSport to eventually fizzle out
and be replaced by something else so
will there ever be a game that has this
long-standing stature of one of these
classic world sports I don't think it's
ever gonna happen right like there's too
many games that follow trends there's if
you look at you know the way puppy works
right now right and a huge swell of
interest in pub G and its battle royale
games they think right well there's
gonna be an eSports scene about this cuz
it's two pi even if it's a weird thing
to make an eSports game over it's too
popular too
it was like Hoth snow it's like possums
garbage for eSports it's it's like
flipping a coin and but so many people
want to watch it anyway that they made
scene out of it do you think games like
that harm though like the the overall
goal of eSports I don't think so like I
think you can watch anything
competitively as long as you having fun
watching it and people having fun
playing it then it's totally fine when
you think about eSports you think of
like everything right yeah how do you
ladies get it to be taken more seriously
I mean I think it already is
like like with overwatch League twenty
million dollar buy-in and the people
have actually bought into it from the
NFL from the NBA stuff just happened
with League few days ago where a bunch
of popular teams got kicked out because
they all agreed to do franchising for
the LCS which is the big league of
Legends League and those guys from the
NFL and the NBA buying in with millions
and millions of dollars they're taking
this stuff seriously
and even if you've got a bunch of games
that do that like it's almost you know
just like real sports you've got your
big sports and then you've got stuff
that maybe a hundred people Jewish yeah
and that's the sport and some people
still enjoy them and yeah you know four
hundred people watch Starcraft in five
years then 100 people watch soccer after
five years blush sure they're still
having fun with it right you can make a
competitive scene out of pretty much
anything you just could have people
passionate you know after the older age
of empires guys there's no French that's
incredible yeah let's still play oh that
stuff still happens I think it will be
like he'll be around forever but as to
how viable it remains as an eSport it's
gonna be depending on how much how long
the money keeps flowing in you know once
that stops then it becomes an amateur
sport because there's nothing that keeps
sure people playing full-time so do you
think that he supports are headed
generally in the right direction and
like where would you see it in the next
10 years going
I mean it's frankly the way he sports
going right now scaring the [ __ ] out of
me like especially with the with with
the LCS thing of the last few days you
know can you explain that so I've been
out of the league scene for like a few
years so it's gonna be a real layman's
explanation so if people no doubt point
out that I'm wrong on a few things but
the basic level of it is that for LCS
that a bunch of teams in there commute
what is that else something else yes of
the Maine League of Legends League right
where think the League of Legends
Championship Series like and they've got
a big world event which is going
right now we look at world champion okay
where all the teams from the different
regional LCS get together and America
losers in career wins yeah yeah but in
the case of LCS they agreed to do
franchising and a bunch of popular teams
just lost their position in the league
and a bunch of guys just came in and it
was based on decisions other than how
good they were it was based on like how
financially solvent the organization was
like guys coming from the NBA that big
money it was right there game developers
made that decision so there's a team
called immortals that has really you
know they were very successful they were
doing really well in the LCS they were
winning a lot of games they just lost
their position in the league because
apparently they have put a ton of money
into this new overwatch League which by
all accounts is a twenty million dollar
buy-in like its massive and Riot was
concerned that the immortals team is
based out of LA riot is also based out
of LA and they have a lot of investments
into overwatch and they're thinking well
we don't know exactly why they weren't
allowed into the league but there might
be concerns that they've spent too much
money somewhere like that's all fake
they see them as like investing in a
competitor they could there's been some
speculation about that because because
of their like an owl with stupid name
overwatch League they're like the team's
are not going to be named like immortals
they're going to be named after the city
they're based in and the franchise they
bought right so this is the LA franchise
for it so riots based in LA there might
be a bit uncomfortable about that but
they might also be uncomfortable about
the idea that they've just spent a bunch
of venture capital and they might not
make it back so they're thinking about
the financial solvency of this team and
the like well what if a team in our LCS
goes and solvent that's really shitty
for the LCS and if you look at that it's
like this is big businessmen and big
money taking over what was very much a
grassroots thing right and has been a
grassroots thing really up until the
last couple of years so is that is that
a good is that a natural is that a good
direction because if you look like a
tell you look at chase ball you look at
basketball whatever this is like I was
what I was watching a news report or
listening to something about like how
Americans spend their money I mean
Sports is like by the sports industry is
huge it's absolutely enormous money
right so in a way it's natural maybe
good I don't know it could be good you
know it's that money might bring
stability it's hopefully gonna bring
some mainstream recognition it's gonna
bring facilities stadiums hopefully
we'll also see a lot of the shady [ __ ]
that's been happening in these sports
last ten years disappear as a result of
pros coming in what kind of shady [ __ ]
yeah that's like the spiciest to come to
my for people who are listening who
don't know anything about eSports like I
think it's interesting just to get in
because everybody sense how sports work
kind of different and weird so much if
this the small stuff like players not
getting paid by their teams all the way
up to [ __ ] like there was a literal fake
tournament I think it was in Malaysia
for the pp SL guys love this event and
then got mugged and had their passports
right yes Oh Starcraft this happen with
Counter Strike and everything as well
and a lot of this is because these
organizations run by the scam artists
amateurs you know they're jumping tons
of Starcraft players they were brought
on two teams that just you know the guy
just disappeared I don't know I think I
can't remember the name of the
organization but there was a guy who
just vanished overnight like guy that
player was asking where's our money
where's our money he disappeared and
Ethan: So the last thing I want to touch on is obviously
You've had a very public battle with cancer
Total Biscuit: Sure. Yeah. Ethan: It's been going on for how long, I mean how long have you been living with cancer now? TotalBiscut: Now I'm over three years. Three, four years now.
Ethan: I think honestly you've handled it with like great grace and optimism from from the very beginning. That's inspired me and
first of all thank you for
For doing that TB: of course. E: And I think it's been a beacon of light, I think,
for a lot of people of just like seeing how you can handle it with with dignity
And I know that Hila's dealing with some- her dad... Just got recently diagnosed with cancer. We were talking about it backstage and
It's really nice to hear you being, you know, optimistic about it
Basically, well, first- my first question is, cuz the last update that I was able to find was from like June or some shit TB: yeah.
How's it going? What're- What're the updates? TB: so basically where we are right now is that it is stabilized, meaning-
It's not gone away, but it's not growing so there's a couple of small tumors in my liver
And there's one very very small nodule in my lung. So it's Stage four, which means it
Spread past the initial place it was. Stage four is pretty bad. That's when survival chances go in the toilet
on October the 15th
2017- or, 2015, sorry.
I was told you've probably got two years to live. That was two years and five days ago.
Hila: That's crazy. Ethan: Fuck cancer, dude. TotalBiscut: so fuck those odds and fuck those numbers. Ethan: Yeah.
TB: But the problem with,
Metabolized cancer is the-
Metastasize cancer, sorry, it can go anywhere it gets in the blood it can spread to any organ.
Becomes harder to nail it down. You know you can't do targeted therapies as easily. You can't just cut it out
So it being stable at this stage is very very good because it means the therapy works
And it's continuing to work
And I have fairly minimal side effects. Still got me beard, still got me 'stache. You know? E: Well you look good
You don't look like a guy who has cancer. Hila: No. TB: Well last year I sure as hell did.
You know there was ah... people were asking,
I don't know if you'd know, I did a voice back for Starcraft 2 and the photo they gave for me for that
Was in black and white and people were like "Did he die? Is that why they've made it black and white?" Noo!
I look terrible in that photo but
It- you know, I- The chemo sucks of course it sucks. I have every two weeks
I get plugged in on the Wednesday. I get the big dose in the
Clinic and then they put me on a portable thing to take home for the rest of it until Friday
So I'm pretty much like out of action for two days
And then it takes about two days to really get back on my feet
You know? Ethan: What is that experience like- I feel like this conversation doesn't exist anywhere.
Hila: Yeah. Ethan: Of someone with cancer talking about what it's like. Hila: I can't believe that you go through this every two weeks and you're...
Managing to keep everything going. Ethan: Yeah, It's incredible. TB: Yeah, I mean one- I don't see another option. You know it's like
Everyone has a job, everyone had to do their job. E: It just shows an incredible amount of strength.
TB: It's, you know, my job, so huge motivator for me. You know
I'm proud of what I do
And I enjoy it and I know that I'm very blessed to be able to do it as a career right so I want to
Take every opportunity I can to do it. That's why I'm out here with Twitchcon. That's why I'm going to Blizzcon
You know I want to take
Joy in that and I get a lot of satisfaction out of it and that also means I want to be back on my feet
As quick as possible, so you know I look at it, and I say right okay?
I've got ten- if I... if I can get back on my feet I got ten
Good days and four bad days every two weeks, and you know what that's okay. I'd rather have 14
Good days, but I can't have 14 good days. So I'll take ten. That's okay and
I mean the experience of actually being on the therapy itself I mean
It essentially turns you into a zombie. It's one of the best ways to describe it. I mean it's your whole body is in pain
Just constant aching. There's a feeling of sickness although
that varies on a person-to-person basis I get a
subdermal injection right here
It's quite new. They only just started doing this and it's a gel and it slowly goes into your bloodstream
Oh, it costs about five days, and it's an antiemetic so it's an anti-nausea
Gel it knocked the nausea on the head in a really good way like you still feel a bit sick
But I used to like throw up like eight times, ten times a day, like, until I was just throwing up stomach acid
E: That's gonna be really... TB: It just burned
It was nothing but burning. E: That part of chemo has got to be really
Difficult to the healing process right? TB: Yeah E: The whole thing of nausea and puking. TB: Yeah, it fucks you up badly.
Yeah
because you get massively dehydrated like that's
The advice that I give to anyone else to go through chemotherapy two things one
hydrate for the love of God like drink fruit juice in particular don't drink water drink fruit juice it gives us-
E: Calories, yeah
TB: Calories, sugar, really important. The taste will help you drink faster. in my case one of my side effects is I have a cold
Sensitivity while I'm on the pump so if I drink something too cold it can shut my throat and kill me. E: Oh my god
TB: Yeah, also if I just touch something
That's too cold nice that kind of sucks
So I've gotta wear gloves and make sure you know stuffs at room temperature before I drink it
But I found the like drinking fruit juice I can drink it a lot faster that means I can hydrate better and the other thing
Is force yourself to eat
You threw it up. Fuck you, eat it again. Just not the same thing obviously.E: Just don't give up. TB: Yeah, just keep eating
Dude, like because it is fuel. It lterally is fuel. It's fuel to fight if you give up on that-
Everything gives up, but every time I eat even if I don't like the taste of it,
I don't like the feeling of eating it,
About ten minutes after I've eaten or even as I'm eating I'll feel this burst of energy like, it's like,
becoming awake again at least for a couple of hours.
E: It's incredible to hear that because I've been yeah, all of us who aren't sick we take food for such granted right.
H: And also it's the most basic thing that you can think of.
You gotta fuel yourself to continue. TB: Right, it's so obvious until your body is screaming at you not to. H: mm-hmm.
TB: And telling you I'm gonna throw that up if you do that
I'm just like no you're not I'm gonna eat it, and if I throw it up
I'm gonna cook another thing and I'm gonna eat that
until
Something stays down because you need those-
Nutrition, you need- you need that nutrition. If you don't have it your recovery is gonna,
Get longer and longer and your- your immune system is gonna, just collapse. You know. I have a surprisingly strong immune system
I should have no immune system by now. my immune system is fine, and it's taking a bit of a beating, but it's fine
A lot of people in my stage can't even travel because it'll kill 'em. You know, catch catch a cold ya dead.
For me now, I've been fortunate in that they found the right combination of drugs
They found a chemo that was unpleasant, but I could tolerate it and I've got a good oncologist who knows what he's doing so
you know, all I need him to do is keep giving me the stuff that works, and I'll keep fighting it, and I'll keep going and
That's the only option there is. Just to keep going. What other option is there? You just give up? No.
There's nothing else. Nothing beyond this. E: mm-hmm. TB: You've got to fight. Ten good days, four bad days. Even if it's
One good day, 13 bad days. That's still one good day.
E: Do you find that you've become more optimistic in some ways since your diagnosis with cancer? TB: In some ways.
It's hard to worry about petty shit
When you've got you know death staring you in the face
E: Do you feel like you have some knowledge that you wish you could share?
Like I know, for example, to use it mildly you'll get a flu and you'll be like man
I can't fucking wait til
I'm not sick again
And then the moment you're better you forget all about that
Is there some kind of feeling that you're always having like that that you wish you could just share,
That you wish everyone could appreciate and feel is that something? TB: I mean it-
Think of chemo as getting over the worst flu of your life
and
Feeling like you were not a real person while you had it that E: That sounds awful. TB: Like a zombie.
Even trapped in your own head sometimes. Think about being so tired that you can't watch Netflix. It's too exhausting
That- that's what it does to you and as a result, what you've got to do, you get trapped in your own mind.
I s- y'know, even listening to things like audiobooks. It's like bright light.
Sounds, anything, any kind of stimulus becomes scary. It's, you know, you jumpin' at shadows, it- it screws with your mind.
It screws with your head in a big way. There's a
Fog, paranoia, it...
is a really nasty thing to put in your body
But ultimately you got to do it and you got to keep doing it if you want to actually overcome it
There's no easy way to do chemotherapy
There's no magical advice, but there is stuff you have to do. It's tough it helps to have someone close by you
Helps to have someone like my wife that will push me to do these things, that will say you've got to eat,
You've got to drink. I don't care what you think. Eat the fucking food
Having somebody like that, having that kind of support system is essential.
I don't think I'd be alive if I didn't have that. E: God bless her TB: Yep, dude.
H: Well that's really inspiring.
TB: It is what it is, you play the hand you're dealt, you do the best you can, you don't give up on it
You know, it's- because it's not just giving up on your life. It's giving up on everyone that's ever been touched by what you've done
Your friends your family
Pets for God's sake you know you want to be there for them like they deserve to have you there for them
the only way that that's going to happen is if you keep fighting and
It's possible like
Fuck these statistics
They don't mean anything. If you don't like the statistics, change the stats now. Live long- outlive it.
It just keep going because science is fucking amazing and they come up with new stuff every day
They come up with new treatments all the time
E: Do you think that chemo will be looked back on and hopefully as soon as 10 years as
This like- almost like how we used to electrocute people with mental illnesses? TB: The way we look at leeches, only barbarism.
because we're killing the patient and hoping the cancer dies faster, E: right TB: It's not a great way to do things
But it's the best thing. We've got right now. There's a general first line of defense. It's not the only thing
And people should be aware of that. You know if chemo fails for us. I have a neighbor
She's had stage 4 cancer for 20 years
That's he's currently doing immunotherapy
Brand-new immunotherapy she's doing really well on it like the tumors are shrinking. She had cancer all over her body. You'd be
Shocked by what is out there, or what is being developed right as we speak.
E: That's awesome
TB: And all you got to do as someone that has it, is to
Give those guys a bit more time. Give them as much time as you can give them and that means putting in your effort
surviving. E: Right H: Right TB: Simple as that really.
E: Is there an organization that we can donate to that you in particular hold in high interest, that's worthy of people's money
TB: I mean there's quite a few, I- what you've got to watch out for with cancer in particular
there's a few that are not a good idea like,
I always get upset in October because it's Breast Cancer Awareness Month and a lot of the
Companies donate to Susan- Susan G. Komen, E: Right TB: Which is a terrible organization. They they waste money on
'awareness' raising, they waste money all over the place, they don't give to
research and they sue other charities. They're a disgusting organization.
Absolutely horrendous, E: So where do we send money?
TB: Yeah, you can send money to a local Research Hospital. You'd be surprised how helpful
that can be, you can donate directly to your local research hospital. E: Look up L.A- like I would if it's me, Just L.A. cancer institute.
Boom, here's my money. TB: There will be a- there will be a link to donate to them like that one going directly towards the fight
E: You've got these huge organizations like American cancer- cancer TB: Society E: Society or whatever, and I'm like if I give them five thousand bucks
What- where's it go? Where's that money going? TB: Yeah, it's always good to look on Charity Navigator
You know it's a very good site for figuring out
Where the money is going and look at the breakdown look at how much is going to research versus administrative cost versus awareness. As far as I'm concerned, should
be going to research. E: Right. People know about cancer. TB: Yeah, people- they do
E: We're good on awareness. TB: Yeah, there's still some things that would be good
I would like to see there be a bigger push to get- there- for younger men,
especially when they have symptoms to go and get checked. This is what I said when I first got diagnosed
I, you know, I had colon cancer. It's embarrassing, you don't want to do it, at this age nobody thinks they've got colon cancer. E: We were talking backstage
It's like in America. They don't even recommend you get a finger up the ass
until you're like
50. TB: Now that wonderful experience at like 28 or whatever, but ultimately yeah, it's fucking embarrassing, you know it's more embarrassing? Dying.
That's pretty shitty yeah, shitting yourself when you die, maybe some- E: Some people, some people can do it- well, nevermind.
it's yeah, but
Ultimately people have to take their own health seriously, and if they see symptoms for the love of God
Please please if it's nothing fucking celebrate the fact that it's nothing. E: sure.
TB: Okay, you just went through some unpleasant shit you maybe you got a colonoscopy or a finger up your ass, big fucking deal,
You're gonna have to have it sooner or later
E: Yeah, TB: it's gonna have to happen. So you might as well get it E: Finger up the ass or death? TB: Yeah, pick one.
E: I'd get fingered all day boy.  TB: I think it's a pretty obvious choice. E: I think that's actually really important and
To raise that awareness. TB: Yeah, take your own health seriously. E: I mean, just go to the fucking doctor.
I'm- I think we're all guilty of prolonging- TB: we absolutely are. E:  you know, it's like, but man-
You got to take care of your shit. TB: You do ultimately.
I could have been a way better position if I had and I didn't because I was embarrassed
E: Is that right? TB: Yeah. E: How long did you have symptoms but didn't go to the doctor? TB: About a year.
E: Really a year? TB: Yeah, it's like because there's a bunch of other explanations for it, you always assume. Oh, it's something else,
It's my diet. E: May I ask what symptoms, or is that too personal? TB: I mean, I've told people about it
You're in my initial video. You know it's- we're talking about shit like, you know, we had cold stool, rectal bleeding,
You know the kind of thing is like, you see blood you're still like oh,
Maybe I just had a, you know, a raw steak. You know rare steak or whatever, E: off you rationalize it away
TB: Yeah, I mean I thought I had IBS. I thought I'd maybe even Crohn's. You know what something like that. Yeah or
Diverticulitis, I didn't think I had colon cancer. You know you always assume, "It's not cancer. It's something else." E: "I'll be fine"
TB: Yeah, and then you- yeah, you prolong it like, you know, this is uncomfortable it's fine, and then you're eventually like alright. I'm gonna go
Find out if I have Crohn's or whatever, no, I was like now you have colon cancer like well. That's shit. E: Yeah
TB: I probably should have gone earlier. You know, and anybody- if you have a symptom like that
Don't fucking ignore it. Don't- yeah, it's embarrassing, get over it, go to a doctor for the love of God
you know save yourself a
shit ton of pain later on. E: right
Is there something about cancer that, like, you came to learn from going through it that most people don't know?
TB: It-
There's no feeling of having it
Like right now if you asked, like, "Do you feel like you have an illness?"
No, I mean- H: that's what's really,
Talking to my dad now he can't confront the fact
That he's so ill, because it doesn't feel it. He has a really bad cough. When he doesn't it feels- it feels completely normal.
Yeah, I don't know I have a tumor. I can't feel that I have a tumor in my liver or in my lung
That's- that doesn't impact my daily life. You know there's probably some pain there, but you know I'm on painkillers, it's
probably just
buried there somewhere and
The weird thing is I guess you know people view cancer as this
Thing which will, you know, turn you into a desiccated husk immediately when you've got it and completely destroy your life
No, it really doesn't and that's actually scarier. E: mmm
TB: Cuz you know you've got a cut on your arm
And it's bleeding, you can see, "I've been wounded" and you have a response to that
You got something inside you that might be silently eating away at you
You don't- you don't even feel it's there, E: You don't have that pain response. TB: No. It's disturbing. It's
It's insidious
And obviously a lot of it comes down to the fact. You don't feel it before either
You don't feel it before the diagnosis, but you still don't feel afterwards either. You only feel everything around it
You know the side effects of the chemo. The pain from, say,
You know, the fact that I've had an abdominal hernia for years from the surgery
You know, collapsed muscle wall, things like that, no. No yeah, you have to take painkillers to just manage that and stay functional. E: mm-hmm
TB: but
The actual disease no, it's just there. It's invisible. E: Mmm. TB: That's creepy as fuck. E: That is fucking weird
Do you ever feel like irrationally angry at your own body for trying to kill you? TB: Totally. E: It's like fuck off
TB: Yeah,
I think it was quite healthy, like, being able to visualize it as a thing you can fight
Is much better than having it be a thing you don't understand E: right TB: And a lot of people do that, that's like-
It's recommended even.
E: you have an enemy you identify.
TB: You have an enemy you can see, you can imagine what it looks like you can imagine what you have to do to defeat it.
Versus something you don't understand spreading throughout your body without any...
what- you know- without you even noticing and
with there being no
solid easy
Take this pill, and you'll get better option E: sure TB: That's- that's- that's scary
I don't think about it that way though. You know- I viewed as the enemy ever since I got it.
I view it as something beatable because it is, you know ,and every time we get a scan
And we see it's either shrunken or not got bigger like we're winning you know
E: It seems like you've been fighting it
Successfully for a long time you've beat the odds, and it seems that every is update. It's- it's-
Good news, or at least not bad news. TB: Yeah, exactly. You know, see at least not bad news is good
You know, you'd love that miraculous remission. Where it's just you coming. It's gone
but I'm facing all the reality that that's probably not gonna happen and
You just gotta kind of live with it, you know I know I'm gonna need this treatment indefinitely. E: Do you think that, that,
kind of uh
Personifying it as the enemy is has been one of the keys to your
Fighting it successfully. TB: I think so. E: Mentally and physically TB: mentally such- so important it
It sounds like a cliche
It's not. I know it is 90% mental because that's what drives everything else
it drives your ability to fight it physically it drives your ability to
rehydrate and
to want to get better and to make sure you eat and fuel your body and
All that sort of thing to get up and not skip that treatment this way
It's like I could not go in because I know it's gonna hurt. E: You'll be fine, TB: But I'll go in line. Yeah, exactly. E: Scary.
TB: That's the scary thing, you'll feel fine. E: I'll skip it and I'll feel fine.
TB: Yeah, and what if I just skip the next one as well like, E: That's fucked up H: mm-hmm, TB: but you- but you get up,
You know, get up at 9:00 a.m.. On that Wednesday. I go in they do the blood test
I know I'm there to get a needle and they plug it in right there. E: I can see. TB: you know plug it into the port
Goes in there stays in there for two days. They rip it out. Take salene as they flush it,
you know, to make sure that it's clean and
then you do all over again and
you've got to just keep doing it because if you tap out on that that's it because
This ain't gonna give up. This is gonna keep trying to kill you E: mm-hmm. TB: So you have to keep fighting it back
You can't just give it a break
E: Is there something...
I noticed you saying something about like you
I mean do you appreciate time in a different way because I?
Something you said this truck with me is like I get ten. Good days and four bad days, and that's enough for me
Do you have a different appreciation for time? TB: Yeah. It was like, you know, when we were talking earlier about
Would I go back and, you know, redo a video or change the way that I criticize  those things
I think a lot of that came from that directly. It's like,
I can do a limited number of videos less than I used to be able to do I can work less than I used to be
able to do I can play less than I used to be able to do so let's make sure that time counts for something a
Lot of it is also
You assume at this age. You've got wow I've got 50 60 years of the family
What if you didn't? Well, you know, you don't know how long you've got so
You know, made me want to try and be a better dad. There's no doubt about that
You know I wanted to connect more with my stepson
And then I have and I've been doing that I wanted to connect more with my wife
Make sure that we get a good. You know we get a good run out of it
I intend to be around when I'm fucking 100 years old. We'll be still bitching about video games if I can be but
Sometimes there might be something outside of my control you know maybe
Fighting isn't enough
Maybe that's just not enough to keep going
But if that's the case then you've got to make sure that you spend the time you've got
In the best way you can and even then it's not like
It changes you overnight like you still want to go read Reddit comments,
You still want to bitch at people on Twitter, like you can't change your habit of a lifetime
But there's something at the back of your mind. It said do you have something better to do?
You know and maybe that- that does change you over time I think E: hmm
well
Thanks for sharing that with us, and thanks for spending your time. Especially here with us. I mean I really appreciate it
TB: I enjoy it. It's great to be out here, I get out here so rarely
You know as much as I love the greenness of North Carolina
Sometimes the smog of L.A. is a wonderful place to go. E: Right, yeah, for sure
Welcome everybody, to another episode
of the H3 Podcast live.
Today, our episode is sponsored by D-Brand, Seat Geek,
Naturebox, and—of course—h3h3shop.com. Today, we have the illustrious
VideoGameDunkey, and Leah. Leahbee?
Leahbeex? I don't know how specific I need to get.
Next week we are having Kripparrian,
the Twitch streamer and hardcore gamer.
Oh, I need to put up a thread so you guys can leave your questions for him. I haven't done that yet.
I don't know who to scream at to make that happen—probably just myself.
But in the meantime, before we get into that next week, we have got these two legends here. Now Dunkey,
who is—I'm looking at his back right now.
They didn't want to make it awkward—for me,
'cause I was gonna do an intro, and usually the guests walk in, but they were like, "Well, we're here already." Can you show the wide?
So they're just sitting here, and their backs are facing me. I feel like of the Blair Witch Project.
They're really committed to it too.
VideoGameDunkey.
No one makes videos like this guy. He's a one-of-a-kind masterpiece.
How did I do?
He's known for her loving spaghetti and meatballs,
and, he is also black.
Yeah, nobody knows if he likes it, but he—I think he likes it.
He's a man—he's so powerful, he was blacklisted from playing League of Legends. Forever.
Which is a badge of honor if you ask me. And probably he would agree.
Leah, his carer,
also as a channel—Leahbee—where they make vlogs and cute videos.
And now I present to you my friends, the illustrious, and the wonderful,
Jason, and Leah.
Hey guys.
Now you gotta—
You gotta turn around!
Thank you guys, it's really nice to have you here. It's so cool.
Thanks for coming.
Yes, thank you for inviting us.
Yeah, I feel like you're elusive in a way,
'cause your—your videos are so prolific?
But your character is kind of elusive, so it's really cool to have you in here and see—
I mean, I'm just a stunt double.
I'm not even the real guy.
Okay. 'Cause the real guy is black.
Yeah.
What's the deal? Why does everyone think you're black?
I am.
I am.
Oh, okay.
I think it just came out because—well—he never really did face reveals,
He would, like, put in little clips of his face, but he wouldn't say, like, "Hey, this is me."
And then people just, like, heard the voice and they were, like, "That's got to be a black guy."
You know what's funny? I thought you were black for, like, years. I was sure he was black,
I don't know why. And then I saw your dancing video that you did for, like—
you did some, like, subscriber milestone?
It, may be a million, or something?
Was it the one—it was all snowy? It was winter?
Yeah.
She helped me.
He made me walk around all—
for, like, a week! And that's—it was, like, five degrees out? Yeah.
Yeah, it looked freezing. It was very jubilant.
Very happy.
A lot of confused college kids.
Did anyone recognize you when you're shooting that? No.
They're just like 'This nutty guy...'.
Don't know why yeah, I thought you were black for the longest time, and I was like oh my god
Not black. I guess it's the voice
He's got kind of right
Got like a Louis Armstrong thing
Nothing there master
Yeah
jazzy boys good lord
Well, we've got some some wonderful things here too to celebrate today
Today is mining Ellis five-year anniversary
Thank you so much
And we were at Disneyland yesterday with these two guys
celebrating our engagement, yeah
First announcement congrats, tell me about tell me give me the details
At the post office romances began yeah, I had to ship some packages
And I came back out to the car yep, and he just said look in the glove box, and I was like why
I don't know if that's I think that's even better than putting or like more romantic possibly than
We see it you have it on yeah, can we get a shot if you like
Actually was good because it surprised me because we were coming on this big trip
so I would have guessed you'd like do it at Disney sometime, but
That would have been expected so you know it was a surprise in the car, okay, but you guys planned a vacation
Mm-hmm, but who planned it because was it because of the engagement we planned it for my birthday. Well shit was on Sunday
Oh, happy birthday
Like a double celebration yeah
Damn cold still cold heart
There was someone on Twitter actually I wanted to shout her out because she like noticed when we posted our picture yesterday at
Disney she saw that Jason's wearing the button
And she saw my ring like really tiny in the photo and she was like they got engaged
I was the only like on it. I liked it
Good job that move like get me into the
Yeah, we had like talked about you know getting engaged like sometime within the year, yeah
You had you had hope so
That's what I mean. That's what I was talking about we're a Disney. It's like look
We both knew they were gonna say yes. We don't need to get on horseback and do all this
That's for insecure guys who are like
I'm going to spend a bunch of money to put the peer pressure on them
So they can't say no because I spent $100,000 on that romantic
That's right
Love is putting it in a bag of baby wipes
I think some girls out there
Do yeah they want your like moment they want to feel like you know the most special moment, but that ain't any
With some people. It's just like a mutual. You know yeah, yeah, I guess that's fair
I like your opinion where you don't actually have to hate on people who think differently
Horses are special fucking you gotta feed them
Honey there's a there here the ring is in the is in the box, and there's also a dead horse
You may have noticed I was part of this my wedding gift. Thank you
Horse jerky
Listen I saw this tweet today
Jason and I just wanted to
Know the wicked wolf had said today's the day I finally unsubscribed from your channel, you're a complete fucking imbecile. That's a shame
It was a big
Video he's gone. He's
What was it about the new video? I didn't see anything controversial about it. Did you watch it? Yeah?
I didn't think it was controversial either it really likes those Tekken 1 cinematics
I don't know if he's out there. Just do a follow-up. What happened. Yeah, it wasn't about it. Yeah
I'd like to know more to tell me uh how was your relationship with your fans? Do you see a lot of reactions like that?
He complains a lot about like people not getting his
intention
What is kind of frustrating like which video in particular?
Well this
One, I kind of like confused when I'm trying to get it
Mm-hmm because a lot of times you do something that's kind of a parody
And then there's kind of not and kind of like there's a lot of layers to it, so I fuck maybe for some people
It's easy to like miss the point
One thing I found on YouTube is like you can't be too sore
It's hard to be subtle you have to like hit people over the head with a club
Because I think a lot of the people who write
Comments like they'll write it cuz they were like either didn't like it or they were confused
But if people were just like oh, okay. Yeah, cool, then they'll just move on they're just really great the combination. I got it like
Jimmy Collins ever get to you Oh
Never
He's so like he has a thick skin about that comment. That's good
I'm more like offended by some comments sometimes, but but you seem like you wanna get sued he's like
Why are you looking like just ignore it?
But it's such a it's so messed up because like you were saying most of them are good
See you have a healthy view of it, and my thing is like and I know it's sick, but I'll be look
I'll look at the comments, and I'm trying just not to read them anymore because it's it
But it's like I'll skim pass like all like ten of the nicest things anyone ever said about me
And then one guy was like fuck you buddy
That's kind of and I'm aware of that some eight-year-old is like getting
Funny thing for like my channel and stuff to my mom like reads every cop, Oh Mike
She's like getting deeper than me. She reads all of them and I
Don't I can't
Did she ever text and be like I saw this today, and I just wanted to tell you
One of the talks about it yeah, I don't know she's texting me, but she definitely brings it up like when I go visit
My dad
Commenting nasty stuff
Do your parents watch your videos? Uh-huh I think so do their mom we used to kill the missions where you swearing in these videos?
My kids they're gonna look it up and swear
She's a good second-grade teacher. Oh, that's yeah, so
So I want to ask you because I'm really this most people on YouTube
I watch their videos, and I understand how they're made like I understand somewhat the creative process of what's going on there and
But with you, I don't really understand how you make those videos that you do like
Do you record tons of footage and then voiceover or later, do you do voiceover while you're playing the game
You just sometimes like how does that work? It's it's always different
Sometimes I'll write a script sometimes on this record
Three minutes
Okay, so you're just when you do that
Are you looking for like a specific like shot or you're just like oh that happened, and that was funny
I'm gonna say like like a montage just like overwatch video or a league one
No, just say. I'll try to cut out the funniest parts mmm
Overwatch feels like it takes like months now to just to get four minutes of entertaining stuff one game. Yeah
Like what can I do anymore?
What does that mean what does that say about over welcome?
To the fucking ocean
Second you have massive hard drives
You have such a good system were like oh
Yeah, you gotta use fraps. Okay, okay?
every game fraps and then every time something happens you hit the button, so you know to look at the end of the
Then you're going through like 3,000 clips
You just skip to the end every time huh that's brilliant yeah, and he has to clean it out
So it's not like you know his whole computers always follow usually every day. Yeah, I
Just a bag of Cheetos on the desk
Just like Cheetos all over the
So I've always had trouble desktop recording, I don't know what's going on in my life, but I'm having multiple computers
Multiple programs, I've used like Camtasia. It sounds awful right I mean the name
So there's so many tears what am I doing wrong for like a game?
Anything recording YouTube
Well you know if you record with like bandicam and HD I
Add it with Adobe, and if you put HD shit. You can't edit it. It's like it'll take like a minute to respond
That's just it's like undoable I
Just do like fake HD like 70 yeah
Cuz you putz it all up anyway the video
As long as it says HD
En XD there you go, it's a funny idea for a video super 4k
You can come over and set it up for you at your oh, yeah
What program do you use to edit I do?
Yeah, it's a love/hate. Yeah, do you wrestle with with premiere a lot? Yeah, it's sometimes. Yeah. Yeah, shit well
That'll just what the fuck. Yeah. It just that's what the fuck happened. Yeah
Like what? I'm dealing with now is that when I make a keyframe it will just randomly twist hmm for no reason
There's a twist in it
so I'll go like at this image to go to aid to be and then it's just like i'ma go in a fucking rainbow and
Go up this green. Yeah
Between the keyframes instead of a straight line. I don't know why I'm just like what?
It's a learning curve seventy years
You get to understand the quirks often feel like in Premiere, I'm you have to like outsmart the bugs
Like a sink whant a sequence were like not work will be something wrong so ok. I need to create a new sequence
change the settings to
720
put that in there
Restart my computer five times, that's the solution on the official forum
So when you're editing you have all this footage
Do you just like painstakingly go through all this stuff?
Or do you have an idea afterwards you're like using that trick you said?
Or do you just watch like hours and hours of footage?
I mean I watched it so much that one of the ideas happened then but sometimes
I'll add it all the guidance a shit sucks you do it all
you scrap videos a lot ah
Really anymore. I just try to think everything out now mmm nice time
on the back burner
I got ahead enough, but I didn't so I save it for later. I see him do a lot
That's cool. Like the video you posted today about the bad graphics that apparently caused the exodus
Like you mentioned that you had been working on that for a while so tell me like about
How that video came to be I just started writing like a little script and notepad like last month mmm
I can't think thank this through. I can't get it all together, so just wait till later
And then later you find like you just think about it
You don't like a different way to sometimes like the timings off, too
Like you got to get a new video out mmm. This one will take too long
I'd be on time yeah, yeah, when a new heart like is out were you just like grind for 16 hours
Will you let the crazy?
Cuphead I'm still
Okay you have a cup head video coming yeah, so a lot of people were asking because we have a thread video
Bed no comment for now you'll have to watch
Yeah, we have to like plan our trips around like game release schedules and
Excited for that you got to stay home from reo you can't go anywhere
Take everything off the calendar
My favorite video of yours I think or one of them is the Skyrim one with just all the insane mods
colliding like tell me about the process of how you you that video came to be I
Mean, I think that was just like seeing on everywhere you're going to just see like people just posting mods Skyrim
Just like the shittiest monster the dumbest shit ever there's so many
People just I just wanted to see like how much that shit I can enable at once
Everything you can enable everything at once it seems like like a supercomputer
Like a prebuilt one
It's a predator Jason
So basically you started from just this point of like I want to throw all these in it
See what happen and it was it was
such a joyous I
freaking love that video
His first when they got to the top of Reddit. I think really really no it's kind of like a breakthrough
Like their mom stuffy. What's that cool for you? Yeah? I think that brought in some new people mm-hmm
Do you use read it? Yeah? I look down there sometimes say like comments
sometimes
Sometimes there's some smart stuff on there clever stuff and sometimes it's like worse than YouTube
Huh, yeah, it's true, I don't know when and where to look so I just stopped looking honestly. Oh, you don't like it
We try not to look yeah
Yeah, I think that 1:19 look at the comments didn't read them at all not
Because the thing is like I need to make the conscious choice because I know people like that video
So I need to decide do comments affect me or not
I can't look at them when they're good and then not look at them when they're bad
I'm gonna want to look like either way, and I don't want to look at the comments on a video
That's like mediocre because everyone's just gonna be like
Super rude and like heavy. I'm like yeah
It wasn't the best video, but you don't need to fucking like can't eat my children about it
And so for me. I'm like. I can't like pick and choose when I'm reading it needs to be all or nothing right
Yeah, it definitely can reduce your stress a lot if you decide I'm done like looking at yeah. It's I read every single
And you're not super depressed all the time I
Know it doesn't take any effort to write them income you know to see someone put an effort right now
It was really nice uplifting comments. That's really good. Dude. God bless you man
Seriously we should maybe I should do that yeah, that's actually really cool. We used to do that
YouTube is like introducing like a filter now like a censors thing
Did you see that no I think so I get blocks comments now
I feel like they're just typing then like the n-word or some shit. Do you have that on? Yeah? I think it helps
Mm-hm I mean should I hope with us. I hope it works
It's kind of like I always wonder like should I sense should I block certain comments or just leave it all open. It's like
It's like not a free speech thing it's like just I
Don't need people screaming the N word in the comments like the world was not losing anything
I don't know I used to think like that all right. I don't need a bunch to deal. Yeah. What do you delete on?
Your studies don't think oh you should never delete any all right. Thank ya
So when you delete a comment like when you decide this one it just gets me angry it's like the dumb
Especially if it's a really long one. That's like fuck you just wasted all that time
Do you block because you can mine are you banned I'm black right now spam one like hey
It's me donkey, and it has my fucking picture go on this link and it's like a virus and shit
Then there's like a comment why'd you send this to me?
Well to be fair you give him a virus I totally understand where he's coming from
What's your favorite types of videos to make
It's like something new something that doesn't like super formulaic
He just made like a movie review he like The Shining one it was great school. Thank you
I enjoyed that a lot dude, and I think you're fancy too because again one of the top question was like
Are you gonna do more movie reviews do other kinds of reviews?
necessarily before
Movie stuff on YouTube, I see like a lot of those movie YouTube channels, they get in trouble what's real that's copyright stuff
Yeah less so with video game stuff. Yeah like video games
I don't know. I feel like you can usually get away with it Nintendo will sometimes crackdown
But even then you know a lot of Nintendo stuff will still get through and make money
I was gonna ask you because I heard about this Nintendo thing they when did they do this and make this new policy
Forever ago really. I think I was like two or three years ago
What was it they just take all the like if you have a Nintendo song?
game, they'll just take all the money I
Don't know it seems self-defeating like it's not much money for Nintendo
That's like
So much promotion so little money they're trading like ten bucks
Yeah a hundred million views. I'm free promotion. Which is pretty much what you make on YouTube these days
Did you stop making like Nintendo related content as a result are you still doing your thing? No. I'm still doing it
cool

Sitting through that and now back to video game donkey and Leah
Welcome back with the illustrious and prolific video game donkey and Leah, can you guys please join?
As we did the reads we made them face the wall so that it was less awkward
So tell me who in your opinion makes the best games, Nintendo
a lot of good indie guys
There's so many good someone hungry guys out there trying to make good shit
It's a lot of competition right and then a lot of more competitive than ever
For the Indies yeah, yeah, the games are crazy
But if you go to like the conventions like packs
Stuff like that the Indy section is always like the best part of any convention
Like more so than you know the big companies just more interesting more experimental. Yeah, we get to play the games yeah
They're like right there
That's awesome. Yeah. Do you what do you think about Nintendo as a company because I actually agree?
They make the best games, but like this shit on YouTube
It's just like so they're like what they're so out of touch right it's like
Just everything like in what way?
They still don't know how to do Internet at all like you have to do it fucking
17 digit friend code instead of just add in somebody's name
And like product launches
They never make enough yeah
It's not it's like they're selling diamonds make more switcher
Shout-out to you guys I can get a switch yeah
Sweet ass Fox. We're like. I just bought an extra one. I'll mail it to you. It's like
send me a switch I
Guess that explains why Nintendo is so like oh you can't use our games on YouTube
They're just out of touch you think that's what I think
It's like the switch, you know of course they want to make more, but they just don't I guess they don't have the
Production manufacturing
Yeah, but why not you'd think they could get as much as they want yeah high standards or something
Yeah, so what is it about them that they make the best games like do they have a philosophy or something?
I mean what is going on? They're like they just have all the most talented dudes like
It's got all Japanese dudes this they take their work so seriously
I think this is that culture it's like that honor yeah that deep ancient honour
Because it's so serious. God bless him like I remember I read a thing about Sonic 2
like they try to stay co-developed it and they had like you know they brought in Jeff and
Workers and American workers and American guys are just fuckin off goofing around
Japanese guys taking this so seriously
Track their hardest to make the best game ever you think I
Love that done' way cuz it's like you're making a video game show like oh, this is my dream
I'm a video game, but for them. They're like I will
Start by the samurai sword this is the best game of the decade got it. Yeah, maybe that's it
Let's take a call
Country boy 420. I love that name. It's like a little incestual. It's a little 420. What do you got for me?
Wait what happened we got to make sure this where do you go?
Oh country boy. Where'd you go?
I think I moved country more 422 the wrong channel. Can you help me?
Get his ass in there. Thank you boy for 20
Community such as gaming when it's kind of a kind of like over done. I guess like how do you like different?
She I guess from all the other channels cool nice. Thanks Doug
Just try
I
Don't want you to
Plug DJ in full plug DJ insole unfold goddamnit
Hey, man, how are you, good good? How are you guys we're great good?
All right my question is for for all of you. Um you're both collaborators with your significant others. What does that?
Experience like is it rough at times. What are the main points of having each other's presence when creating content a wonderful question
HS. No problem
You guys want to take that one I remember the Pokemon one
Lea was very hot it was really hot it's getting
frustrating
Come on go
Yeah, and it's like yeah, I'm doing all this stupid shit, but she's filming it yeah, so what's more uncomfortable
You know people give me the dirty looks like my throwing pokeballs at people and shit, she's like over there filming it
Yes, you guys are kindred spirit. You know what you're doing sunk heroes because you watch these documentaries about these guys climbing up to Everest
For iam shot with ducks we couldn't find any ducks
And then he ran into this lake
Going 4 in the morning it don't like get the mist down there you get the Ducks. That's when you got to get
the docks
So it's rough
When he asked like do his recording we like have our desks in our same computer room
So it's kind of weird if I'm like still in there like typing and linkies in my computer
So I like have to go down I go in like our basement and like wait till he's done recording
He has to you know. I'm getting his own, so
You have to work around yeah the delicate genius
I mean like I've never made videos without her
Yeah, I don't know how that's been yeah
You work together a lot more than we do I like for my channel. We do everything together like that
Then well were you making videos before you guys work together or for like how long were you already making videos?
I've been making them since I was like 12. Oh wow
new grounds oh
You're old school, dude
Damn, that's so cool
So in our case. We've been making videos since like day one so I've never even known a
Separate thing I mean it's always been like
Operation from the beginning like even coming up with the ideas and how to do
Even editing will still sit together, and I was like it was just funny, and she's like no
Do you ever be like
I mean sometimes. I would say like you should like put this in yeah
Take like an
Ending league oh, yeah

guys I'm so genuinely excited for that
one but one guest at a time because I'm
excited for today's guests as well Tai
Lopez yep now before we introduce our
guest today actually want to talk about
something that just happened idubbbz
friends of the show friend of ours made
a new video he made a Content cop on rye
scum mm-hmm a little switcheroo and he
titled it content cop Jake Paul as a
parody too because everybody's begging
him for months to make a Content cop on
Jake Paul and then all of a sudden he
does a little switcheroo cause
content cop Jake Paul and immediately
it's like got you just a joke I just
didn't want to give Bryce calm the
satisfaction of putting his name in the
title and YouTube [ __ ] removed it for
clickbait and deceptive practices and
I'm fired up they gave him a community
strike yeah and they removed it even if
they bring it back they sucked all the
momentum out of the damn video or a lot
of it yeah anyone with half a [ __ ]
brain should be able to look at that and
be like this was purposely done too
artistically to enhance the value of the
video
he immediately addresses it and he has a
reason for doing it and he talks about
it right in the first in the beginning
of the video you know it's fine that
there there's there all the sudden such
strict and forces of the rules meanwhile
you know they're like no porn
unless it's art and then you can have a
dude [ __ ] in another dude's mouth
like they're like this rules okay as
long as it's art but meanwhile when he
actually attempts to make something
interesting with clickbait when everyone
else on YouTube is actually genuinely
click baiting and being promoted in and
paraded around by YouTube all of a
sudden he's got to be the martyr for
clickbait god they always have they
always have this way of not getting it
it's so weird like what what how can
they not understand he immediately talks
about it and he actually has a reason
for titling it that way well while you
have Lance yours raped by a demon yeah
that literally is that not clickbait I I
ask you now so if you want to help I
mean if they don't bring it back that's
gonna be one of the greatest travesties
of YouTube history I think hopefully it
was just some deli I'd buck I don't that
is a bit relevant to what I'm talking
about some some person that and you know
sit in a room with their finger on a
button is like oh [ __ ] this guy in
particular hopefully it gets reversed if
not if you want to help tweet team
youtube tweet them there's real people
there they're connected they see that
tell them yo help a brother out
it's interesting how they
there the guy's been working on this
video for months dude and insanity come
instead of promoting people actually put
effort into a YouTube video they they
just ruining it for him he flew to
England just so that peopIe can make a
brief cameo like this guy went all out
on this video and I think that point is
excellent no one else is trying to like
elevate YouTube videos right and instead
of them appreciating that they find a
way to do the opposite they would donate
don't even reach on be like hey can you
change the title they're just like [ __ ]
you you suck anyway tweet - at team
YouTube if you want to have your voice
heard on that one now with that being
said Tai Lopez is a bit of a legend on
YouTube he's been the subject of a
couple of our videos many of you know we
made a video with him recently where we
went to his house got to know him a
little bit my impression was that he was
a nice guy I liked him I mean besides
the fact that he had like a fleet of
lawyers tailing me but that turned out
for the best I mean was it was a
highlight of the video here my garage
the inventor of this meme the 69 steps
the 420 steps he's a YouTube guru he's a
legend you guys all know him back there
he hates my 69 69 place for 20 steps
so anyway let's bring the man in Tai
Lopez gate that sweet tight little ass I
know you're fit and I know that ass is
tight so bring it in here dammit
69 steps yeah alright thanks for joining
us dude how you been for 420 plays and
stuff so how you been what you been up
to and more importantly what car did you
drive here in the blue Rolls Royce did
you really I
I brought it as a present for you oh my
god Wow I knew you yester that's nice
you can hand me the keys now if you got
him there outside
oh hey so anyway I was in Vegas yeah I
took I took a picture out the window one
hour or two hours before right of that
that festival was insane I left two
hours before really I've been right in
the middle of it crazy world man sad
world sometimes but on that note yeah
you are you you were in Vegas
recently in Vegas I was speaking at a
conference well two entrepreneurs
wanting to scale their business for you
just can you just bring a little bit
close I just want you miss anything
this is don't worry about him did you
bring your lawyer just here to hello
okay don't worry about it snow he's like
an intern an intern yeah he's gonna read
me my Miranda rights
just listen he's uh don't worry just try
not to think about it not here he's the
janitor I'll focus no I'm just kidding
oh my god all right you're starting to
scare me now so thanks for your service
to us appreciate thank you very well
done by the way
lots of intimidation but who's gonna
serve me no subpoena on my podcast on
your part by the way that was great we
thought it'd be fine good I don't wanna
I don't want to like drag it out and
actually have him stand there for too
long no just a little bit of a me you
were getting a little late hearted
that's the new meme the ef'n lawyers at
Ty's house that was powerful that was
definitely the most memorable thing and
it wasn't even really planned I just had
a meeting with my lawyers and they were
there and they're like we got it we got
to meet this guy and I don't know why
bill was hounding you like that they do
not instruct him to do a debrief okay
because that's the number one thing that
everybody was like you have to ask him
about yes he was following me yes I have
no idea why
Oh No so who's it's wool that's a guy
three of but he's a compliance lawyer so
I don't believe he promised you you kid
like a Google lorry
no I believe he's compliance okay but
like what do you think I would actually
be like follow him in the cameras I mean
not that's why it was so crazy right I
think I was just like you guys can
listen in okay
and he took that extremely literally as
relating it listening to every moment so
I and then you know this is Hollywood
you want to you want to entertain you
got to be a little crazy so I didn't say
anything I was like I know your audience
is gonna this is gonna spark brand new
conspiracies around about me and I was
like it's a year now you're saying that
it was by design to be entertaining no
and not it was neither but once I saw it
I was like this is this is pretty funny
I mean it was definite was funny and you
were good with the game you guys are
good with the cameras you like turned it
into a central theme of the whole it was
I mean props to that guy but David were
you like dude why the three yeah the
balcony one is my corner one was funnier
they had like eyes in the wall the photo
you could see their eyes you know if I
really would have pre planted I would
have done something like that I wouldn't
let you know because yeah it was pretty
ham-handed yeah the way he did it
yeah well people like the end to I get a
lot of people being like did you really
throw really out and his wife stayed
surprising people like Pro Wrestling Oh
lots of stuff it was a bit of a progress
it was a bit of a pro Russell you can
basically do something outrageous and
50% of people will believe it well that
guy just was I mean there was a point
when I was on the balcony walking down
the stairs yeah and he and I turned
around and that's when I had this
realization doc this is a lawyer
trailing me he's not full-time on staff
I I have the other guys were full-time
is he the premium one is what's he know
just he not that cheap so I like 600
bucks an hour yeah he does compliance
FTC stuff resuming so like we sell stuff
online if
we have stuff that has recurring monthly
fees you got a word it so it's not
tricking people inside so he makes sure
everything's aboveboard
so he was making sure that was compliant
like that I guess such a good man he's
very well but it got but he got views
did I was so memorable
yeah no I'm happy it happened I mean it
wasn't like I didn't feel threatened it
was just like well no he's a jolly guy
yeah he is he was nice he was a good
sport I remember I walked out of the
kitchen want to know at towards the end
I was like hey I need you to sign a
release you said he was ready lawyers
are very serious you probably would do
that I was surprised it was probably by
the way congratulations congratulations
on winning your lawsuit
oh thanks because I know we were talking
about it there yeah thank you so much
yes that's really yeah you need freedom
of speech let people do as long as it's
not crazy crazy listen today was the big
thing you just did you had some other
content and you did like a reaction
video yeah yeah made a video like we
usually do and this one guy just
couldn't take it and he [ __ ] suit us
found an attorney that was as far as I
could tell ya did it pro bono or on it
on my expense agency and they just you
know they couldn't accept that that it
was alright to make that video right and
so they rode that train all the way to
about how luckily we won but it was a
nightmare yeah well I'll [ __ ] with
lawyers man now I was on jury duty like
two or three years ago on a gang a guy
stabbed somebody in the face and I was
on the jury at my basic it was a month
it was a hung jury in and out wasn't
usually your I was in like 28 days my
basic conclusion was don't go to court
if you don't have to I mean the the
prosecuting attorney suck the D I mean
if you're poor too it sucks the world's
so unfair cuz that yeah defense attorney
was I was like this dude should defend
himself that bad she at the end fake
cried the attorney my client and all the
jurors right when we went in the room
we're like was that a fake cried well
like yeah
it was like so bad I was like poor guy
cost us quarter million to defend
ourselves adequately once we got like
good real attorneys yeah it just it was
kind of disillusioning how how rigged
the system is towards money oh dude
that's insane I didn't grow up with
money so I never saw that side of the
coin but basically especially in America
money runs stuff made money is and
that's why I tell people you know I talk
a lot about money but I'm like money's
more important that we're taught it's
not it it's almost a necessary evil in
the modern world it is for sure yeah Oh
two weeks ago or not last Sunday I was
at the Amish you know I live with the
Amish for two and a half years when I
was young so I was back there and then
the next weekend I was it here there for
Vegas it was quite a the Amish still
have that kind of diverse society not
money driven not material a shirt it's
kind of those are the guys with the
beers and the way beards it's not
Mormons not the opposite sometimes
people don't believe I was there I was
like I still speak their language but
man it's good I got to get out of the
city every once in a while yeah so let
me ask you yeah I know a just to follow
up on the items stuff the video is back
oh it's back yeah sorry this year there
was some YouTube drama going on okay and
one of our friends video got taken down
and we were all just like ranting about
it but apparently it's back up like you
do a new soap opera you know if you put
a hundred bucks in Bitcoin in 2010 you'd
have seventy five million dollars yeah
that's a nightmare someone asked me did
I do it I was like no I wish but like I
was reading it's like yeah you know
there's no such thing as a genius who
was like I predict that boy it's like
you got lucky right forget lucky yeah
anyway listen by the way I'm doing a
huge prize invited 50 of the top Bitcoin
crypto guys to my house tomorrow so I'm
doing a little private dinner because
I'm more of a businessman and I want to
learn more about icos and crypto so it's
gonna be see a future and all that stuff
yeah I mean what the internet did
media like disrupt sure Bitcoin and
crypto currencies ether are gonna
disrupt it's still sovereigns than money
currencies it seems that even now after
Bitcoin and all these other crypto
currencies I've gotten like pretty
famous and a lot of notoriety I still
don't know how to use that right it's
still not able to me that's when the
money is there once everybody that I
think it was JP Morgan or one of these
old billionaires said once you're
shoeshine boys giving you advice on
money it's too late
sure and so like Bitcoin what I never
always tell people never be the first
like I'm good friends with Tom from
MySpace he's actually coming along so
you had first social media platform was
Friendster didn't make any money you
know I do became an alcoholic cuz he had
turned down thirty million bucks come on
by and then it's where it was worth zero
then Tom came along him and his buddies
they built myspace they sold it for five
hundred men they were the second but the
third guy Mark Zuckerberg is one of the
you know almost the wealthiest guy in
the world and so with Bitcoin it's the
same wave 2010 was probably the first
wave I always say get in between the
second and third wave because it went
three yeah I see that you know let the
first guy fail become an alcoholic can
possibly end until my guy who start a
Victoria's Secret he sold it for five
million bucks and jumped off the Golden
Gate Bridge because it turned into a
billion-dollar brand not bad right yeah
not nothing worth ending your own life
over no no no I know no amount of money
jump off a bridge all right let me ask
him okay you were the first person that
I can recall that has kind of pioneered
the genre of like the self-help guru
whatever your motivational I don't know
you refer to yourself but you basically
put your videos your ads on YouTube as
video pre-rolls yes I mean what can you
tell me the process that led you to be
like man I think this is untapped like
right you wait for you the second or
third or were you the person there was
some guy there's a few guys before me
out showers in the second way so you got
it so yeah there's these guys six-pack
ABS no actually
how good their business is doing but
six-pack abs will subdued some guy they
were doing like by their workout plan
mm-hmm but I wish I could say I was
smart I would say I got lucky and all
success is like 50% skill 50% luck you
know I mean you need some skill
obviously but 2014 I mean I've been
entrepreneur since I was 19 I've been
doing stuff and but more behind look
traditional business and then in 2014 I
was like I was at this conference and a
guy's like dude YouTube and YouTube was
already around but it wasn't been I was
like I've learned my mentor Alan nation
told me ty never be the first or the
last to try a new idea so I was like is
someone else doing he's like yeah this
guy seems bad so I said okay so I went
to Europe in December 2014 for New
Year's Eve right before this parachuting
everywhere I go man when I leave god

country or city you wanted to leave with
me but uh I come and in that case you do
want to be the first you want to be the
first out that's right but I had order
