Last year NPR had a super solid summer playlist and I was going to see if anyone stumbled across one from this year. Sorry if this isn't a good place for my request!on trump's lawyers' reluctance to let him testify under oath "they're treating him like a monkey escaped from a cocaine study"Did I just hear the piano from ODB's  [Shimmy Shimmy Ya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2zgB93KANE) as out\-tro music on Marketplace???I'm looking for this segment I grew up listening to with my dad. I still hear it now and then. It sounds like an older man \(he has a great speaking voice\) and "acts out" or tells what seem to be made\-up stories. Sometimes there is a woman in this segment too. They were always so entertaining and I would love to find if there are is a library of sorts that I could listen to. I think they came on in the evening, but I'm not sure. If you know what I am referring to, do you know what it is called?I remember this show that would come at about 12:30am when I was getting off late in Chicago. It was this man talking to himself stream of consciousness style, sometimes with music, and I never heard anything like it or since. Does this ring a bell for anyone?The Car Talk joke was "the Nina Totenburger." Just in case you missed hearing him on All Things Considered or haven't enjoyed any of the On Point guest hosts since Tom Ashbrook got the boot. My husband is trying to remember something he heard on NPR. Unfortunately he doesn't remember when exactly or even what time of day it was but this is what he does recall:
1. It was an interview with a professor or teacher. 
2. His son had committed suicide.
3. This is the big one. He had a theory that photographs "know" everything that has happened and that will happen. And so looking at a picture of him and his son when his son was just a child, the picture "knew" that his son would kill himself.

Does anyone at all know what my husband is talking about? We have done a ton of different searches and have come up empty. Thanks!I have been noticing that lately a lot of the TED radio hour episodes are re-runs. Is there no new content available for them to make? I don't get why they have to do that. Could anybody tell me what the reason is? Anyone listening to this guy? Denied Kai’s claim that public opinion was against him and said public opinion is on his side.....this guy is the worst  Sorry, pet peeve, just listened to an All Things Considered piece and the reporter kept mangling 'nuclear'.  Nails on a chalkboard for me.Marketplace proper is one of the most popular American Public Media shows distributed via NPR, but I guess the Weekend hour was not as well received. Seemed to air everywhere though. July will be best of shows. 

I really liked Lizzie O'Leary, hearing a voice of my generation, covering the more folksy features based Weekend shows.I remember between each segment there used to be this unrelateable strange interpretive jazz music. Maybe at some point it was cool, but years of it was too much to enjoy. The current Hip-Hop vibe is welcomed with open arms. It's like the marker that Hip-Hop has grown up. Thank you. I'm trying to find (or put together) a comprehensive listing of the stories read on Selected Shorts (ideally with broadcast/rebroadcast dates).

WNYC's archive goes back to Jan 2016: does anyone know of a listing that goes back further?

ETA: If anyone has information they'd be willing to share, please DM me or add comments to the [GoogleDoc spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VVrXsUPUEgMjj0ZkkfD0L27zSyT6qYvoHZpvWqyQS6A/edit?usp=sharing). I haven't got very far (as of 25 June), but I'll be adding to it in my spare time over the next few days.

I get it’s about their culture and accent but it is just so over the top at some points it is literally laughable especially when they are speaking plain American English less than 1 second before. Is it an accent? Is it a speech impediment?

I actually think his odd way of pronouncing the letter is  kind of endearing. But I've not heard it anywhere else. So I'm wondering what others think of it.hi. im certain i recently (past 3 months) heard a story on NPR/kqed/88.5 on fireflies and I believe this man trying to collect the local folk stories about them. 

I am certain he was from another country (=/=usa) and he talked about the translation of the word 'firefly' and the related translations with regard to that word in his native language (arrgh so annoying to be unable to place it) this was a big part of his story, regarding the language of fireflies. 

He talked about how you don't see fireflies as often as he remembered as a child, and the marvelous effect seeing these bugs, and maybe he mentioned how they don't like city light (or you just cant notice them, but i want to lean towards the light or pollution was driving fireflies away/extinct from his local home).

Anyway, please let me know if anything about this sounds familiar. I think it was on Radiolab but not sure. This guy has been trying to witness the show for sometime. But usually by the time he gets to these remote locations after someone reports seeing it, the show is over. The sheer number of these insects seems almost endless, needless to say the experience is once in a lifetime.Also who will be all the hosts starting tomorrow? I’m a few have left and some have joined this new yearThere has got to be some other solution. Why do you have to switch over to Canadian news. I don’t give a shit about that boring country. I read the posting rules and am not trying to be mean or uncivil. That said, this post/question is “negative” feedback on a host.

Living outside the US, I enjoy and appreciate the “NPR News Now” podcast very much. That said, the pronunciation blunders that Shay Stevens makes on a consistent basis really detract from the experience. NPR already has her in the graveyard shift for American listeners, but that’s morning for me in the GMT+1 time zone. It’s very hard to avoid her, and obviously the RSS feed doesn’t indicate the announcer (in other words, for Stevens’s apologists who might suggest to simply listen to something else ... that requires abandoning the entire feed, or several consecutive hours of the feed until she’s off shift).

When I first started listening, thought she was simply an intern ... but then September came and she remained. After looking her up, I see she’s a veteran. And furthermore that there’s very little info about her online (lots of “removed results for privacy” on google and few twitter mentions, and even fewer negative mentions).  It seems like someone is very effectively identifying and suppressing any negative feedback about her.

Does anyone have some explanation of how someone making consistent blunders continues to read the news summary? 

Full disclosure - I don’t know what answer an outsider could provide, but hope that someone in NPR sees this and it is yet another straw on camel’s back until she is moved to a non-public-facing position. Or perhaps someone here has the good news that she will retire soon?

Another observation - the egregious blunders seem to come in waves, and then subside (like every 3-4 months it becomes intolerable, then she seems to have better control over pronunciation and reading aloud for a few months).  It really doesn’t seem like she’s drinking or on pills, rather that during these periods, she’s incapable of reading aloud at a high school level. 

The single negative commentary I found on google critiques her variable pronunciation of Washington vs. Warshington at beginning and end of 5 min news summary - this is nitpicky and doesn’t bother me at all. I’m talking about the egregious mispronunciations and blunders.

Thanks for any info or sympathy!

Did anyone else catch this interview? He's the author of The Threat Matrix and very knowledgeable about Mueller and Comey.

It was interesting listening to him extol Mueller last night, to wake up and read that the FBI is biased. I loved the song that they included after playing “Not My Job” with Al Roker, but the transcript seems to list it incorrectly, and I can’t figure out what the sound byte is from!

The [transcript](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/20/579212540/not-my-job-tv-weatherman-al-roker-gets-quizzed-on-coldplay) says Coldplay “Yellow,” but the lyrics from the podcast upload we’re something about “good morning sunshine, this could be your lucky day, things are going to go your way”

Any ideas?So my favorite NPR program is easily the TED Radio Hour, but lately it seems like I've been starting a lot of episodes to hear Guy's pre-recorded dialouge about how this episode already aired anywhere from 1 to 2 years ago.  Do these guys only put out a new show or two each month, or is production slowing down?  There seem to be a lot of TED Talks to use yet, especially with all the TED and TEDx events going on in the area. If You haven't had a chance to listen to this interview you should go take a listen because it was fantastic. The back and forth was mostly unbiased and I'd like to hear more of content like that so if you guys have heard any interviews like this were somewhat unbiased opinion from Republican or Democrat point me in that direction thanks guys and go ahead and listen if you haven't yetHey guys I did a feature on public media and NPR. Since y'all are NPR fans here, I thought I would share. If you're interested I'd love if you checked it out. But no worries if not. Have a great day!

https://youtu.be/xJUNkgNpfe4On a spring/summer evening either last year or the year before, I heard an interview on NPR wherein a conservative guest was describing how Republicans could approach climate change and get some wins out of it. He went into detail about smart investing strategies, and explained that you normally hedge against a risk. However, if climate change is the threat that some believe it is there is no way to hedge against it. His conclusion was that in a situation like that you had to invest aggressively in fixing the problem of climate change. A lot of his rhetoric talked about turning this into a conservative win.

Does anyone else remember this interview? Do you know what program it may have been on or who they might have been interviewing? I would really like to find it again since it is a really good bipartisan conversation piece.Dear NPR,

Thank you.  You have been the well-spoken, highly informative, constant background drone in the morbidly monotonous cycle of events that is my life.   While I cannot remember a single hard fact just moments after listening to your program and also have difficulty articulating the main points of each segment, NPR does allow me to, when in conversation, enthusiastically nod my head and utter, “Oh yeah, I heard about that.”   You make me feel like the active and engaged citizen that I am anything but.   The companionship you provide throughout my day dulls the cold edge of loneliness and utter pointlessness that consumes my every waking moment.  

Thanks!

Bay Area Dreamer
I listen to 1A today and I am confronted with the same old cold reading scam artist tactics that I've seen in astrology for my whole life. Why are they giving screentime to someone like this, when there's nothing more that needs to be said about astrology that hasn't already been said about the Long Island psychic? Did they miss those episodes of Bullshit with Penn and Teller or Cosmos with Carl Sagan?


EDIT: don't get me wrong, I love 1A with the two sided coverage, having people on from both sides, is where it's at and I don't see a lot of that anywhere else in the way that it's presented on 1A, but this kind of stuff is jet fuel for a one-second stations Switcher.On Point used to be the best show on air. Tom ashbrook was straight fire🔥 

Now a days the host wants to talk more then the guest

The guest will be speaking when suddenly a wild Indira appears to cut off your train of thought

"well...well I have to ask you..."

"Your right but..."

"Well tell us..."

"Hold that thought...(asks a question"

"Ok let's see..." 
Sometime after 2005 but probably before 2013 — I wish I could remember more accurately — there was a From the Top show featuring students at a music camp, probably Idyllwild, but that's simply my assumption.

The sketch was called "Cell Block A440", and was themed on practice times being enforced at this camp by draconian prison rules (including solitary confinement in the "Schnittke Shed"). I'm unable to find it on the FTT site. Does anyone recall this episode, and maybe have a way for me to find it? I'm constantly referring to it, and have had zero luck. I want to share the FTT joy with this sketch!This was up a good half hour before the final three snowboarder's went.So I have good internet I can stream 4k no problem but when I try kuow from any app/site it buffers. Any ideasI am reposting this after a writeup on my local subreddit, but I thought it might be something to discuss here. Open to any thoughts:



Can we talk about KUOW and by extension NPR's weekday programming for a minute? I have been listening to them nearly daily for 10 years, and only recently have I started deciding its better to turn the radio off than to wake up or drive home to them. I'm a full on liberal, but these national only stories are NOT why I try to listen to local stations (sadly we have no other local stations that aren't commercial drivel and conservative radio).

KUOW has 1 program that is local during the day, and its on at 12:00PM when nobody with normal work hours is listening: http://kuow.org/programs/record - they tend to not really discuss any of the big local issues, usually tending towards national social issues catalyzed by local events. I feel like they're totally dropping the ball for having any actual local coverage.

I end up having to listen to either the last part of Morning Edition, or All Things Considered in the morning. Both of these have just become completely awful, and feels like I'm listening to liberal talking points the same way that fox pushes whatever the conservative talking point agenda is.

Morning Edition consists of the Trump Scandal Of The Day, and national stories. Its draining, there's never a positive story on.

All Things Considered (Liberal Political Things Considered) is getting to be the worst. Here are the only 4 topics they discuss currently:

* Environment/Climate
* Minority human interest
* "Russia"
* #MeToo

It is tiring. I'm tired of listening to the same stories, and I can't freaking imagine there's not more out there in the world to be covered, even if I'm fully on board with the political movement de jeur. If you want to understand my perspective, listen and try categorizing each story that comes on in the morning, and notice that there is rarely a single story in the hourlong broadcast that doesn't fit into one of the above bullet points.

Guess what none of these programs have anything to do with - Seattle. None of the biggest problems, local points of pride, or local news are on KUOW, or if they are they must be in the 11PM slot, with their tone and format thoughtlessly taken directly from the national shows. No talk about housing costs, the homeless, development, food, or transit is on during a time that most can listen.

Maybe I'm the only one that thinks this, and it feels awkward to criticize a station that I nearly always agree with compared with the the pyramid-scheme and conservative BS on other radio stations, but I've just about had it with NPR in Seattle and nationally.Today I was driving home when it hit 4PM and the 5 minutes of news, and when jack spear began talking about the school shooting, it gave me chills and made me get goosebumps and feel sad for a little, I’m not on to cry and I very rarely do, but when he said this I slightly teared up, NPR you guys have amazing reportersAmazing coverageAnd here I was thinking it was custom music all these years. 

The song is called [“Everything is Alright” by the band Four Tet.](https://youtu.be/O7kCIX2KiS4)

I was listening to SomaFM’s [Digitalis station](https://somafm.com/digitalis/) when it came on, much to my confusion. 

Enjoy!Hi all,

I love listening to talk radio, but have yet to find news talk that I particularly enjoy. I like Democracy now, but that's not exactly a radio station with programming throughout the day. I don't want to upset people, as I assume most of you like NPR, but I personally find a lot of its programming to be sort of a part of aristocratic left-center culture. That might be my own bias, but just what I perceive. Are there any cool alternatives to NPR that might be a bit further left?how to findHow do some of the panel know of all those weird obscure news stories? How do I keep up to date on those types of stories?I don't really see a reason to signing in despite the ads insistence that they wont do anything creepy with my data. The fact that I'm getting shut out by a sign in screen seems to suggest they do want to do something creepy with my data.

Am I missing anything if I just go back to using my mobile browser instead?I tuned in my local NPR radio daily. I know Joshua Johnson 1A is from WAMU, Terry Gross Fresh Air from WHYY... those program are broadcasted nationally aired at fixed schedule. Then in between there is other news by various voice, end by "... this is NPR" without knowing who he/she is, where they come from.

What's the role of local (state level) NPR station? If they don't have nationally recognized/aired program, what role their staff play on daily basis? do they interview other? When Up First started, NPR was promoting that new episodes would drop by 6:00 AM every morning.  For quite some time now, getting a new Up First episode by that time has been hit or miss.  Is this just my podcast app (Pocket Casts) not fetching new episodes, or has Up First abandoned that promise?  

I tend to leave the house at around 6:10 EST every day, and I'll do a manual refresh of Pocket Casts to try and get the newest episode, but more often than not it doesn't come.  Then when I pull into work at around 6:45, the new episode is ready to go.

EDIT: Added the fact that I'm in the Eastern Standard Time zone. Did anyone catch this segment where they talked about fictional Wakanda from Black Panther, the implications of unlimited resources and whatnot? There was a catchy African drum /electro dance jingle at the end  and I’d be so happy if anyone can tell me the name of the segment and what that song was. Much thanks!Does anyone have the audio from Morning Edition this morning when Steve and David didn't know whose turn it was to talk and kept talking over each other?  It was a moment of levity.I'm looking for information on the musical interlude that was used today during All Things Considered. It sounded like it was a cover of Won't Back Down by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers in a bluegrass style. I tried looking on npr.org but couldn't find it.It's an episode of "This American Life," "Radiolab," or "Invisibilia." I ***think***. There's an outside chance it could be a different NPR show. There are approximately three sections to the episode, then at the end, some people sing a song that they composed about the sections of the episode. Please, please, please help me find this! I've been searching all three shows' archives for months and coming up with nothing!They keep making the headline all about the shooter, his face was the first thing to pop up when i open the website. Now it's all about his background, possible motives, etc.

I know it is not their responsibility to do so but I wish they withheld on making the story about the shooters life and possible motives. 

I know this is not an original thought but I think news like this gives a stage for person who doesn't deserve it.

To be clear, i dont think information on shooters/terrorists should be completely censored, I just dont think their life, motives, etc should be the main story.

Thoughts???? the hell is this?  
   
It's been like this for at least a full 24 hour period now. Go try to access the stream on the website and it doesn't work, but if you have the streaming link url, it just plays this US Naval Observatory master clock thing over and over. 
  
What happened to the online stream?   I was wondering do people donate money to their favorite show or to their channel?   Radiolab asks for money and my local WBUR channel asks for money.   I'm tempted to donate to Radiolab directly but if donate to my local channel isn't that also supporting Radiolab.   I'm probably totally over thinking this. 

Update:   So after some thought and digging around a bit more,  I decided to donate to WBUR.   I listen to a lot of shows but Radiolab is my favorite.   I would like to donate to both but can't do that right now.   The deciding factor was actually my employer who allows me to donate to WBUR through payroll.   They match the donation and take it out of my paycheck which was super easy.     http://one.npr.org/i/556051091:556052288

&gt;Inskeep: Very briefly, what do you make of Weinstein's statement? He says, I'm sorry, I'm trying to get better, I've *hired a coach*, I'm really angry, so I'm going to attack the N.R.A. to get my anger out, and, meanwhile, says he's suing the New York Times - what do you make of that?

&gt;Hazadia: Yeah, and he also misquotes a Jay-Z lyric -

&gt;Inskeep: [loses it]Best of Car Talk (the re-cut reruns they've been airing in the years following Tom's death) officially ended production last week. Some stations will continue to air reruns, but this week my home station has replaced that slot with *How I Built This*. 

I'm curious with what, or whether, your station has filled the slot.Hey totally off topic, but is the flair impossibly tiny for anyone/everyone else on this sub? I find it hard to discern what the station flairs read; if it is tiny for everyone else, I vote we enlarge them a bit! I briefly yesterday (or maybe Saturday?) caught a snippet with a host talking about his friend who had passed. It was incredibly poignant and I wanted to find it, but I don't know who the host was or what the show was. The host said he has a young voice but is 60. His friend had never been married, maybe she hadn't even been kissed? It was such a beautiful tribute I wanted to hear it again in full.Personally, I've always had an appreciation for recognizing the occasional song bumps between news stories on 'All Things Considered'. And most other times, I would hear a song that sounded genuinely interesting, only to forget and never look it up. I'd be impressed if anyone here could Shazam those ever-fleeting bumps by the way.

At any rate, I decided I would make a playlist that had every 'All Things Considered' song on their program for a week at a time, for the sake of general music appreciation and to discover some personal gems. I have now flushed it out into an outright September playlist after getting the idea of sharing it here and getting your thoughts on the music of 'All Things Considered'. Enjoy!

I have been searching for a while, on mobile which isn't as effective, for an piece I heard about a month ago. It was about Fentanyl/Carfentanyl exposures to first responders and featured a CDC physician who spoke about effects to first responders and how they were not related to opioids. Would anyone know how to find the article? Or know the article and can post a link? 
Thank youI cried (and I'm not that dude)

I just turned on NPR One, and instead of playing the latest National Newscast, it literally just played three minutes of the US Naval Observatory Master Clock voice ("At the tone, Eastern Daylight Time, seventeen hours, five minutes, 6 seconds *beep*"). I had to play it back several times to make sure I am not insane.Paris Dennard... why do they put him on air? He doesn't debate in Good faith. I rember when npr held itself to a higher standard than the 24 hour news channels.It is rock sounding and begins with an electric guitar playing some chords followed by an organ coming in on top of it. There is a female narrator saying things like "we're reporters in Washington DC and in bunkers all over the world" etc. I hear the commercial pretty often and across different programs but most recently heard it on Here and Now. I have been attempting to find it for a while now but have been unable to do so
I've recently heard [NPR (ATC) cite statements made by various politicians at the recent Value Voter's Summit](http://www.npr.org/2017/10/13/557628660/conservative-christians-express-frustration-toward-congressional-republicans) while not addressing the groups status as a [LGBT hate group, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/values-voter-summit-whose-values).  I realize this would make NPR appear left-leaning and potentially politicize a non-issue, but I also think stating the hate-group status is important and is failing to fully inform the listener about the organization.  [They do mention it briefly, but not enough to really invite the listener's skepticism, and it is not in the regular rotation of news] (http://www.npr.org/2017/10/13/557459193/trump-set-to-address-values-voter-summit-for-first-time-as-president).

Perhaps they should host a two-sided debate about this status?  I also have a slight problem with SPLC in that they labelled Ayaan Hirsi Ali an extremist.  NPR mentions the SPLC enough that inviting the listener to understand the issues with the organization would better inform everyone, in my view.

In any case, I believe the issue of SPLC designations should be discussed.  Any other thoughts on the subject?It was a story/interview about a guy who was in charge of regulating companies from sending out opiode shipments or something. He explained he could get shipments stoped but then leadership changed and they started halting his cases. And then the 2016 law passed and it was terrible and the bill name was a lie. I am hoping for a link to listen to this in full.I was so used to just getting in the car with my first coffee of the day to take my kids to school and turn on NPR. 

For the last week, the first thing my kids and I have heard has been about rape and sexual assault . Rape, gang rape, and yesterday they were talking about sodomy with a baseball bat. 

Not how I want to start the day with kiddos...Felt bad for Browder though, having to play catch-up for the NPR listeners.


"It's kind of a long story..." he said.


Maybe it would have been easier to tell if NPR hadn't kept it buried for so long?We were talking the other day about how disappointed we were that Paris Dennard kept getting all the calls to present a conservative voice on Here &amp; Now, and suddenly I've heard three or four new commentators - all with much less blather and much more insight.  The guy today, from Texas, was genuinely interesting.  I could see where he was coming from, and while I disagreed, at least there was a starting point to work from.  Good for NPR - sounds like they're trying new things and those new things are working out!Sometime over the summer there was a book review segment (possibly on All Things Considered). The author was a female NPR commentator (as far as I have been able to research, it was NOT Koki Roberts) and the book was her nitpicky views on the English language. I recall thinking that my grammar-Nazi husband would love this book, but I haven't been able to find that segment again. Does anyone remember it?The past week or so when I check the Morning Edition page for interludes, absolutely zero are listed.

Today I heard a hip-hop beat that sampled a slowed-down 'Change' by Tears for Fears that I loved, but alas I can not find it anywhere.

Anyone recognize it today?  Came on at around 7:42-7:45 EST.

Just a warning folks may want to rely on Shazam instead, especially when not everything that is played is listed.I've registered for personal API access for NPR but I can't find my API key on their site?I welcome everyone's opinion on this. But personally the reason that NPR attracted me when I first started listening was their intelligent, in-depth, and fair reporting. I was confident that I was getting a good representation of both sides of the aisle in each segment.

However, the more days that go by in the Trump administration, the more tinge and sarcasm I catch in the tones of the hosts. Even the masterful voices of Morning Edition.

Believe me -- I get that every day of the Trump administration produces gaffs worthy of reproach. But the existence of the sarcasm indicates to me that the reporters that I trust can't help but let their biases creep in and affect their work. I'm just starting to worry that NPR is (and maybe it always was) a heavily liberal and anti-trump echo chamber. There was an interview on NPR today about a group that is trying to get people of differing opinions to talk to each other.  It's name begins with Sound and is a .org, but I can't remember the rest of the name.  Anyone hear it?Has anyone else been having issues with the iOS NPR One app since upgrading to iOS 11?

It used to be rock solid but now randomly stops playing and disconnects from my car every couple of minutes. Playing music still works fine and it does this whether it's plugged in or connected over BT. Very frustrating.Hey all looking for a little help - I just heard an amazing story on my local NPR station (91.7 in Cincinnati) about the opioid epidemic and specifically a DEA agent named Joe who was fighting against shady opioid distributors and how the industry and Tom Marino worked to shut him down.  Does anyone know what the program was called?  Is there anywhere I can find the program online so that I can share it?  Thank you very much,Sorry. If r/conspiracy wasn't obviously inundated by Russian and Right-wing shills, this might belong there. 


I have noticed a huge drop off in coverage of the Mueller investigation lately, and I haven't heard a single mention of the charges dropping. All I'm hearing is stuff about Puerto Rico and North Korea. Is NPR compromised? Any link to NPR pieces about the charges would be appreciated.was so biased.  The "news" stories did not mention dates so they implied that he acted criminally while on the Trump campaign. And then on Morning Edition, they interviewed Adam Schiff, ultra liberal Cali congressman.  Schiff is on NPR constantly.  I am disgusted by NPR's political "news" coverage now. It is so completely biased. I have a 50 minute drive each way every day that doesn't line up with my local stations playing of either Morning Edition or All Things Considered. Since updating my cell phone to Android 8.0 Oreo I haven't been able to use the NPR News App. I'm trying to find a good way to listen to the NPR current news programs. 
As far as I'm concerned the NPR One app doesn't fill this need, as it doesn't play the most recent news. My current solution is to open up the web site through a browser on my phone and request the desktop site, then play the entire series. This isn't ideal I can't forward through stories I'm not interested in easily while I'm driving. 
Does anyone have any better solutions? I realize this is incredibly ignorant on a couple levels, but I recall listening to an NPR / BBC report on party constituents either campaigning for / celebrating the victory of (I believe) Ram Nath Kovind, India's newest president. The British reporter who was interviewing a party worker challenged him on the number of vehicles in the convoy stumping for the candidate, and it was humorous. 

I could easily be wrong about this, so I'll be lucky if you all can figure this out. I have **EXCLUSIVELY** learned through email (for my Public Media Fans venture) from Kendra of NPR's Audience Services division that the new look NPR News app has been delayed and won't be released until Spring of 2018.The guest was a conservative trying to defend the GOP's upcoming tax cut proposal, and it was toward the end of the episode, Tom Ashbrook kept challenging his blatant bullshit, and at one point he yelled at Tom to stop interrupting him, and even sighed, and went "....jeez!"

It was embarrassing to hear an adult basically have a tantrum on national radio.Sometime within the past several months, I was listening to Fresh Air and heard an interview with a businesswoman who had written a book about managerial conflict resolution. The gist of the interview was that there were 4 styles of management, something like compassionate criticism, aggressive confrontation, avoidance, and feigned sincerity. 

I hope I can find a link to the intwerview or book.Ok, this is so weird.

So, about a year ago I was listening to NPR... and I listened to a fairly interesting story.

It was about a guy who had a brain tumor or some other neurological malady that caused him to develop a sexual attraction to... I think safety pins, but it could be another item, some kind of pointy object, I think.

Is this actually a thing... A segment? Can someone please me, because I might be losing my mind. Hasn’t had a show in three weeks.

Just wondering if it is DOA because it never found an audience.On Morning Edition today Steve Inskeep interviewed a former CIA agent in China. Among other things, Inskeep says he returned to his hotel and his laptop would not work. He opened it up and said the hard drive was not properly connected and a screw was missing. The former agent said “your drive was imaged”.

How likely is this? Does this happen to random people visiting or more likely to media people / government people?

What if your laptop doesn’t have a removable hard drive, like a MacBook Pro where the Solid state drive is not removable and just soldered right into the logic board?

I guess full drive encryption is prudent and don’t let your laptop alone for the day?
Because I did and found it pathetic. Tom Perez is the new chair of the Democratic National Committee, charged with restoring trust in the DNC after the Donna Brazil debacle. Ashbrook kept asking him to explain what went wrong and how he would stop it from happening in the future, and Perez just kept avoiding the question. If anything it made me trust the NDC even *less* than I did before I heard him just refuse to be open and honest with NPR. 

That was hard to listen to. I’m looking for an interview that happened between two men. The guest was talking about an idea that I can only partially explain. I believe i heard it in the last year or two. 

The idea is that as a human you are responsible for helping other humans out no matter what. If you don’t, the logical conclusion is that you think your life is more valuable than others. 

They may have also brought up the fact that you should donate a kidney right now even if you don’t know anyone who needs it. 

They also talked about one of his students who worked at a financial institution. It was better for that student of the same belief to work there and make that money because he would use it better than a person without his belief using the money in a “selfish” way. 

Any help would be appreciate!

Seriously, I know about [NPR Voice](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/fashion/npr-voice-has-taken-over-the-airwaves.html), and I get the lowered voice during serious interviews. She takes it so far though, and sounds like she is going to break down when talking about new economic data.I listen to NPR one a *lot*. Like at least a couple hours a day.

I've noticed over the last week or so that the app is now running out of stories. I'll try to skip a story and the skip forward button will do nothing. Even restarting the app doesn't shake this.

Is NPR producing less content or are they trying to discourage binging public radio as I have been for years now? For years I've had the NPR.org program stream downloaded as a url which I could play through my media player (winamp).  
  
I think I accidentally deleted it from winamp **or** it mysteriously disappeared the other day. So, I need to find that URL again.   
  
Problem is I can't for the life of me find it anywhere. And now instead of the "national" stream on the website, I'm getting my local station.  
  
Anyone know what happened to the stream? Did they change it so there's no longer like a "national" stream?  
And anyone know how I can download the URL for the stream? I've already tied checking the page source etc. etc.I almost never know the short but the narrator is almost always an actor or actress I have heard a million times. It's a fun game for me. That is alli recently got into the show and i absolutely love it. over the weekend i listened to about ten episodes and, sadly, now i can’t find anywhere to listen to shows that happened before july 22. if anyone could tell me i would greatly appreciate itThis morning may have been an all time low.  The guy makes no sense at all and is fast and loose with the truth.  Just a Trump puppet.  Please get someone who isn't an embarrassment to your show to represent the Republican side.  David Brooks comes to mind but someone similarly thoughtful will suffice.  With all due respect I think you are making race way too important a factor in your panel choice and the "discussion" is becoming almost unbearable.I attended a live show the last time they came to Seattle and will attend a Seattle show at the end of the month. I noticed that they're doing two shows this time, one on Thursday and one on Friday. It looks like this also happened for the recent Minneapolis shows. Does anyone know what they are doing now that they have two shows in a week? Do they just pick and choose segments they like from both to make the radio recording? Is the guest the same? I suspect they would have to change the questions for the panelists too.The following is a public petition.

Dear NPR News:

I recognize that you [parted in 2013 from your tradition of on-air credits](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2013/08/30/217303423/npr-and-on-air-credits-the-end-of-a-thank-you) (according to [The Two-Way](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/)) because on-air credits are a turn-off for listeners to *Morning Edition* or *All Things Considered*, but I do not believe all of NPR&amp;rsquo;s listeners would be turned off. Without hearing credits, some listeners not aware of their station&amp;rsquo;s schedule may still think that *Morning Edition* or *All Things Considered* will run in the next hour!

Also, according to *The Daily Banter* (&lt;http://thedailybanter.com/2013/09/npr-rolls-credits-on-rolling-credits-and-you-shouldnt-be-happy-about-it/&gt;), though listeners may not want to hear on-air credits, employees often do (the same reason why American Public Media keeps running their credits at the end of *Marketplace*). In my own opinion, without on-air credits on radio or television, there's no way for an employee to verify his/her past work at NPR (apart from staff directories, which may no longer be available when such verification is needed).

I have already contacted you and your employees&amp;rsquo; union (SAG-AFTRA) about this issue, and it seems both of you neglected to respond in an appropriate manner.

**Therefore, I propose that you re-instate credits at the end of each hour of *All Things Considered*, *Weekend Edition*, and *Weekend All Things Considered*, and just before 50 minutes into the hour during *Morning Edition* (because of *Marketplace Morning Report*).**

Sincerely,

Ryan Cunningham

Lately, the most recent newscast is hit/miss for showing up on my "catch up" feed. When I search for the newscast, national news, etc. it doesn't show up. Today, I found yesterday's 11am feed, but that's the first time I even found anything at all. I'm not super saavy with their app. I listen to the newscast and WWDTM every week.

Any suggestions?I've been listening to WWDTM for a while but only recently started checking the sources, and many if not most of the short amusing news stories they ask the panelists questions about are from the Daily Mail. Why are they referencing this tabloid as though it's a credible news source?Hey guys, I want to say 2 years ago or so I was listening to this christmas story on NPR. The parts that I remember are fuzzy, but basically it was about a family that went to these great lengths to show their kids that santa clause was real. 

The parents would hire actors to play santas in need and the level of detail that went into this display was sort of unnerving. However, I can’t seem to find the story anywhere as I don’t really have a good phrase to search for, so I’m hoping maybe someone here has heard it! 

I know I’m grasping at straws here, but anything helps!

EDIT; HEYOOOO I FOUND ITDid anyone catch a story on narcissistic behavior on Sunday? I can't remember what show I heard it on and it would be useful to reference today. I believe it was a short snippet about narcissistic behavior and how it relates to sexual relationships and I'm pretty sure I was listening to KPCC in L.A. Thanks! -EricSorry if I'm posting this incorrectly or if it's not allowed, but this bothers me a little bit.

Why is there so little/no coverage on the upcoming Net Neutrality rules that are being voted on this December in the USA?  How can I request more light is shed on this topic? Which show would I request do this? 

I just listen to the news stories while driving while working.  So I'm not sure which casts would cover this story the best.I am not a regular listener of Splendid Table, and apparently her retirement from the show is old news, but I just heard Lynne Rosetto Kasper this morning on a promo for her Thanksgiving day show declare that this would be her last "Turkey Confidential".

My family traditionally does the one hour trip to my parents on Thanksgiving day and "Turkey Confidential" has been a traditional staple of that trip.  Her enthusiasm and sheer joy always set a great tone for the beginning of our holiday so I was very sad to get this news.

Congratulations on your retirement, Ms. Kasper.  Thanksgiving day won't be the same in our car without you. :([Segment starts at 31:50](https://www.kcrw.com/news-culture/shows/press-play-with-madeleine-brand/language-in-the-age-of-buzzfeed-and-twitter)

Madeleine: What does [ending net neutrality] mean in practice for you and me when we use the internet.

Janet Guyon (technology editor Quartz): In practice it may mean that you are going to pay more money if you use the internet a lot.  One of the aspects of this is heavy users of the internet say you watch Netflix all day long, you should have a fast lane to get that service and for that fast lane you might need to pay more money.  Right now most people get their internet service they have the same charge every month and everybody in the area you live in pays the same amount of money but if you use the internet a lot more than somebody else maybe you should pay more.  And that’s kinda the heart of net neutrality.  It’s the idea that everybody should have equal and open access and at the same price. So I think that this doing away with these particular rules, and exactly how they’re going to do that is not quite clear, is sort of the ability for people to pay for what they use.

Madeleine: Doesn’t it also mean that certain bigger companies would have access to faster access times?  In other words it would be easier to access something from Netflix than from a smaller company.

Janet: Possibly.  It does introduce into what we have grown up with on the internet a pricing structure that’s disparate for different people and for different companies, so if Netflix wants to get distribution for their movies they may have to pay more and that means maybe your $99 a month fee or whatever you are paying may go up if you are a heavy user of Netflix, so, you know, it just changes the pricing structure both for consumers and for companies depending on how heavily they use the web. 
I know there was just a post about this guy last week, but I heard him on air for the first time today. He sounds like a Kellyanne Conway clone, and all he does is obfuscate and dodge or cast accusations when he is backed into a corner.

I don't think NPR is doing us a service when he is interrupting Bob Shrum every 5 seconds...it feels like a cable news show. I listen to NPR because it is civil, facts based, and not "news entertainment" like Fox etc.

NPR, don't stoop to this level. We need to communicate to our local stations that this is not healthy for NPR."The evening will showcase a top-secret lineup unlike any other, featuring some of the staff's favorite musicians from the past 10 years. Prepare to be surprised." 

I'M SO EXCITED BUT SO CURIOUS!!!! Any guesses? I'm wondering if anyone else has this issue. Whenever I'm reading a story on the NPR app and there is a reference to Twitter (and let's be honest, there have been a lot over the last year and a half...), the quoted tweet doesn't show up. Is there a way to fix that?I have recently wanted to re-listen to a story that aired one evening several months back. I do not recall the time frame exactly, but the content was "3 kinds of love, as displayed by animals". The three types were Family, Friends, and Romantic.  The animals in the story were Elephant, Bats, and Angler Fish, if my memory serves me correctly. 

Any info as to where to find this story would be greatly appreciated!

I recall being so interested in this voice coming though the car speakers discussing how the housing market was uneasy.

Have a blast in retirement!

Is it possible to disable on the mobile app any stories whose main component is race? It's getting more exhausting than Trump topics and I'd like to not have to skip every other story.Hey all, I've searched this subreddit for some advice on being an intern at NPR, but I haven't seen too much about the possibility of being a recording or podcast engineering intern. Has anyone had experience with this in the past? Does anyone know if these departments take interns? Is there anything I can do to make my application standout among other engineers? Thanks!I caught the tail end of an announcement on my local NPR station (South Carolina Beaufort WJWJ-FM 89.9) that "due to an FCC mandate, we are limiting our time on-air, but you can always catch us online!" Maybe I heard wrong or misinterpreted this. Did anyone else hear this on their local station? I remember some time ago, within the last year, a guest from the military was talking about his job was to think about non-traditional battlefields.  I remember he discussed he sale of Monsanto to Germany.  Anyone rember the guest or episode?[This show hosted by Guy Raz](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this) is a great combination of entertainment and cool insights - a few personal favorites include 5 Guys and Airbnb.

He was talking about his life and lessons learned from MLK. He wrote a book - title something like, rivers, streams, ponds....something like that.

I was chopping wood earlier today while listening to NPR, and I had to stop what I was doing to process what this guy said. It was basically:

"If Hillary had won, would we be talking so much about Russian interference?"

Did anyone else hear this segment? It was such a weirdly moronic thing to hear. I can *kind of* understand where this guy was coming from, but come on. 

Does this make sense to anyone?Joshua Johnson was out and they had John Donovan as host. It was like a completely different show, much more conversational and informative. Anyone else agree? Disagree?Hello r/NPR!

Is it only me?Would be cool, thoughts?So I was listening to 1A yesterday (4/2) and they were talking about the US census inclusion of the citizen question. They cut to a break, but there was some technical issue and I heard Mr. Johnson, I believe, say something along the lines of "--that's why Trump got elected in the first place! Of course I'm gonna do that motherfucking shit!" it was loud and clear.

I couldn't say it was Mr. Johnson specifically, it wasn't an on air broadcasting voice but it sounded like him to me. I almost spit out my coffee.I'm devastated.  Now instead of queuing up a list of playlists (Ideally first NPR politics, then Planet Money, Indicator, All Things Considered, and if I have time On Point), I have to individually select each one.  This kills my habit of setting up a playlist then going on a drive unless I want to a) be dangerous on the road switching the podcast all the time or b) stop every time I need to select a new story.  That's not even possible on the highway.   
   
I guess I'm just ranting, I don't know why they got rid of the feature but I'm just really disappointed and sad.  The app itself just seems to have a ton of white space (scrolling) and little ability to customize... maybe I'l be able to figure out how to revert it back to the old version.

Update: While this is not a perfect solution to the problem, to mitigate the issue I have started using Overcast.  I can’t find the daily news podcasts through it, which is frustrating since those are the 3-4 minute segments that the playlist feature was best for, but I can get popular podcasts like planet money/npr politics/on point/the indicator to be in a single playlist so I don’t have to change my podcast as much while driving.  Hope this helps someone!Just heard an interview with the Mexican Ambassador. How nice to hear someone being so diplomatic in the face of so much American bulls~it. While I want NPR to have as well-rounded coverage of issues as practical, and I want to hear perspectives I disagree with, I found [the interview with David Rivkin about EPA administrator Scott Pruitt](https://www.npr.org/2018/04/04/599361744/working-with-scott-pruitt) to be of such little value that the only thing I learned (rather, was reminded) was that there are plenty of people out there who will look through major problems with this administration as long as their agenda is being advanced. By the end, I just wanted to send NPR the feedback: "don't bother putting this guy on the air again." Hi guys,  there was a story I heard on NPR but an educated black man who was arrested at a basketball court and the subsequently had his life ruined during his dealings with the judicial court.  I think it aired during the Ferguson times.  Can anyone point me to the story?Briefly had the radio on yesterday, couldn't really listen to the show, but it was a woman talking working at a zoo and her love of gorillas. Was only able to listen enough to be intrigued, but it felt like the middle of the show and I had to get out of the car. 


Any help would be greatly appreciated! 


Edit: sorry, here I the info people are asking for. I am in Clermont, FL. I believe it was local, around 3/4pm.The Politics Podcast usually puts out bi-weekly episodes on Monday and Thursday evenings. The past couple weeks, though, they haven't put out the Monday episodes. I didn't hear them say anything about a change. Does anyone know whether they've scrapped the Monday episodes altogether or if this is a temporary thing because of all the random breaking news updates?When I share something I'd like for it to start at a specific point in the content.

It doesn't do this by default, but is there a way to make it work?I listen to loads of NPR podcasts. I decided to try the Spotify podcasting and don't seen to have any NPR shows available. 
Does anyone know of I can add them?As per the title, I am looking for a series of podcasts that I assume was on NPR where they discussed the perfect candidate for the 2016 elections. They had a whole bunch of economic policies that economists suggested which were then tested on focus groups. I found it really interesting and want to find that again but I cannot for the life of me find it! Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

ThanksIs Mary Louise-Kelly the star of ATC now that Robert Seigel left?  I've noticed that it seems like she's hosting the show EVERY single time I listen, and she seems to do most of the talking. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy her presentation and her voice is something different to listen to, but it seems like she's the main anchor like Carol Off on As It Happens and the others have been shoved to the side (Audi Elsa and Ari)Who is your favorite top of hour headline reader?  After a few months of listening on a regular basis I've picked a couple.  Anybody on the weekdays or weekends is fair game. 

- Shay Stevens
- Jack Speer
- Jim Hawk (I chuckled the first time I heard him because he sounded like the inexperienced substitute, but now that I've realized he's had a long storied career I have loads more respect for him). Been a long time NPR donor and I always used the NPR app to listen to Morning Edition, Weekend Edition etc. 

With the new app I can't seem to find Weekend Edition at all and Morning Edition only shows the latest episode. 

I've downloaded NPR One (which I don't care for) and can't find these podcasts there either. 

Anyone found a solution?I was listening to NPR around 10:30 or so last night and was listening to this super sad acoustic musician. Having trouble finding it, can anyone help?Hey, my name is Kyle and I go to Coastal Carolina University to study communications, and I am conducting a research project on listeners of NPR and political opinion.

I'm seeing a lot of snippets all over the place, but I'm not able to find it in its entirety. Is it on tonight's episode of Fresh Air?Was anyone else pretty mad that Up First didn't acknowledge the passing of Carl Kasell? Listening to Wait Wait Don't Tell Me when I was younger is what drew me to listen to NPR as I grew. I think he deserved a mention.With the official departure of Tom Ashbrook, it seemed like for a while they were just rotating guests hosts, but lately I’ve noticed the hosts have been pretty big NPR names. Have they moved into the audition phase for a permanent host?I only caught the end of the interview, it was with a man who frequently hosts other programs on NPR. The interview was about James Comey and the new book he released, where this man says Comey is a talented writer. I remember the tone of the interview was that Comey not be as forthright as previously thought. Please do not take offense as that's just the tone I felt, I don't actually know what they talked about during the interview and would love more information. Thank you!Hi everyone. I'll try to keep it short and some of this is already posted on /r/PBS.

I now have my own podcast called Public Media Daily. I'm using the platform of "Messy Bun" to do this and I provide the latest news inside the public media industry (not just NPR only).

Its new, quick and daily. Available on Messy Bun, Apple Podcasts, Player FM, RadioPublic and hopefully everywhere else too. Please subscribe and leave a rating or review because it will help.The story involved a scientist who was going on his 3 year anniversary with his girlfriend, and she was unhappy because he was not giving her enough attention, and instead dedicated all of his time to his work on time travel. The scientist then starts thinking back on their relationship and how they met while she was trying to get on the subway, and starts to feel bad about how he has treated her, and realizes that he loves her. The story concludes with [SPOILER] the scientist going back in time to the night they met, and preventing them from having their meeting so that she would not have to go through the pain of their relationship. 

I've tried googling anything I could think of, but I can't find the name of the story. Any help would be appreciated. I think she debuted yesterday, talking about Trump and Macron.  I didn't catch her name.  Sounded young and black.  Very down to earth.  Thanks all!I've a linked NPR.org account to my email and I registered to receive a personal apiKey. I created an Application from there too but where is the apiKey? Is it suppose to be the Application Secret?I was listening to my local npr station (KERA out of Dallas), and the program "All Things Considered" with host Ari Shapiro was on.  He began the hour with a story about Ronnie Jackson withdrawing his own nomination for VA head.  Accompanying this story was a soundbyte of Trump giving an opinion on the situation.  In the background of the soundbyte you could hear several children's voices.

Ari goes on to say that you could "clearly hear children's voices there for bring your kids to work day."  Immediately after saying this, he follows up with "speaking of the children of course, not the president."

I won't lie, I nearly crashed my car laughing.A guest Doug Gordon just described his sleep paralysis experience.

Seriously shook me.

My experience was (as many others are) almost identical.

Mine was the same, tough there were 3 distinct silhouettes of human form that I percieved to lean over me during mine, as opposed to his 1.

After falling back asleep following the paralysis, I had an even stranger experience.

I had what I would call a "waking dream" where i was observing it all in a half sleep phase from the same perspective as I was sleeping.

In this series of subliminally imagined-or-not events, I witnessed MYSELF, open the door from the hall, look around the edge of the door, look me straight in the eye, wave my finger at myself in a non chalant, sarcastic- scolding-ish manner... And then on "my" way to exit through the bedroom bathroom as the experience ended.

The "Me" that I saw was wearing a black cheese-cutter style hat, which I've never worn at that time or before.

A year later, I moved across the globe to work a year in New Zealand, where one of the first nights there in a pub a stranger slaps a black cheese cutter on my head and sarcastically waves his finger at me.

I wore that hat for a year before I remembered that dream and made the connection. 

I literally stopped in my tracks walking you work, slack jaw agape, dumbfounded as it hit me.

These things never happen to me.

There's a glitch in the matrix.



Did anyone else notice how NPR is avoiding the term “Golden State Killer” and instead referring to this perpetrator as the “East Side Rapist”?  Can anyone explain this decision?OTM used to have a great website, then one day it disappeared to be replaced by a page on the main WNYC site. The same thing just happened with Radiolab. What's going on?So, effective immediately NPR\APM completely removed decades of Prairie Home Companion archives which used to be available [here](http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/) but all you get now is a giant letter regarding the accusation and terminated relationship.  

That's an enormous trove of Americana completely ripped from the annals of history over an allegation.  It's kind of disturbing, even if the allegations are true, that all this content just vanishes to the ether.  If something terrible was discovered about, I don't know, Ray Bradbury, should we stop teaching Fahrenheit 451?  It's madness.  Anyway, I was *literally* planning a hard drive buy last week so I could download these archives and now they're just....gone.  I'm upset by all of it.  Does anyone have them still?  Thanks.
They really need to invite The Lumineers.....
&gt;*According to the Bolsheviks, the contradiction between political and economic rights within the media had been resolved through the nationalisation of the media. In Lenin's model of media freedom, the propertyless majority of the population abdicated their political right of media freedom to the minority of professional revolutionaries, who ran the nationalised newspapers and radio stations on their behalf. Crucially, the Bolsheviks derived their claim to absolute political power from their knowledge of the correct revolutionary ideology. Because they had been corrupted by the false ideas of the old order, the Russian workers and peasants were unable to express their long-term interests through regular elections. As a consequence, the revolutionary conspiracy had to use the nationalised media for the education of the population in the correct ideas of the new society. Therefore the majority of the population were excluded from any direct or indirect participation within the media. At the same time, media workers were also prevented from expressing their own opinions in print or over the airwaves. In order to guarantee the ideologically correct content of the media, the Bolsheviks turned all journalists, printers, broadcasters and engineers into employees of the revolutionary state. Thus, by the early-1920s, Lenin and his followers had instituted a new definition of media freedom: the one-way flow of propaganda from the ruling party to the population.*

[Source](https://i.makeagif.com/media/9-26-2017/BNo-8z.gif)NPR needs to change with times and audiences, I totally get this. Plus, they always have to worry about money. Plus, plus the new biz is chsnging. I feel like I understand it and I really want to believe that they are doing the best they can.

I have noticed changes in content, reporting, etc since around the end of the Vivian Schiller days that I'm not psyched with. I think I'd attempt to (perhaps poorly) sum it up as reporting becoming less fact driven, having smaller scopes (remember when we'd hear more about the DRC?), less focus on the arts and culture, more click baity and emotional. A bit less objectivity or fight, perhaps, though I admit that I cant put my finger on what exactly makes me feel feel this way.

Even before the fall election, I felt like I was constantly hearing the same 5 stories told throughout the day by different reporters with nothing of interest added. Idon't know how to say this politely, but, it feels, dumber?

1) Am I being too hard on npr? Does anyone else notice the difference? Is it just me?

2) Are there any media outlets that report objectively about the behind the scenes or reporting changes/decisions at npr? I feel like I can find coverage of this easily for nbc news or fox. 

Not being an NPR hater; perhaps I cant let go of the past?Post 'em here, folks. Vote to your pleasure and watch the cream rise to the top.* 
Let's see if we can do better than APM.

&amp;nbsp;


^*(NB: ^'Cream' ^is ^not ^the ^only ^thing ^that ^floats. ^At ^least ^one ^scatalogical ^metaphor ^also ^comes ^to ^mind.) I was driving home listening to ol' faithful NPR tonight. Their 6pm (eastern) report broke down the Flynn situation this evening. Idk which program it was but in case you heard it, here's three key points left out of their coverage: 

I. The report began with a conversation between the shows host and, I believe, NPR's Washington correspondent, the vaunted Tamara Keith. 

Tamara still seems pretty damn convinced that Trump obstructed justice in his March conversation with Comey, in which he asked Comey to "let it go," regarding Flynn's lies to the FBI. Tamara has forgotten a critical point regarding this incident, which is Comey's June 8th testimony regarding said incident and the question surrounding whether Trump "obstructed justice," when making the aforementioned request. Despite being directly asked whether he believed Trump obstructed justice, Comey refused to testify that he personally thought Trump had obstructed justice at all. 

In fact, the MSM's obstruction of justice narrative at first included the allegation that Trump was actually pressing Comey to drop the entire Russia investigation altogether. [Even the MSM seemed convinced](https://thinkprogress.org/trumps-efforts-to-obstruct-the-russia-investigation-may-have-finally-gone-too-far-1513e5d9f3a4/) that simply requesting Comey take it easy on Flynn wouldn't be enough to constitute obstruction of justice, which is why they implied for months that Trump actually pressed Comey to drop the entire investigation. That is, only until Comey himself testified that Trump's request was with regard to Flynn only:

&gt;"I had understood the President to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December...I did not understand the President to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign."

II. The second thing Tamara seems completely oblivious of is a key fact regarding Trump’s firing of Comey. She wants to discuss all the discrepancies surrounding the firing, but is apparently unaware of of a September leak to NYT. A first draft of Trump’s letter to Comey, informing him that he was being let go explained that the firing was the result of [mounting media pressure regarding false accusations of an FBI investigation into Donald Trump personally, and Comey’s refusal to go public with the factthat Trump was not and had never been under investigation by the FBI](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/us/politics/trump-comey-firing-letter.html), something Comey finally clarified not only in his June 8th testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee, but also his written testimony to the Committee the, released the night before. Two other facts conveniently left out of NPR’s coverage this evening. 

III. Tamara takes her bow, thanks for stopping by. Carry Johnson takes the stage, apparently wanting to "decipher" the following tweet by Trump:

&gt;["I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/937007006526959618)

Carry was exploring the recent guilty plea by Flynn and seems hard pressed on figuring out whether Flynn broke any other laws during his late December conversations with Russian Ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kisylak. 

What Carry seems to have conveniently forgotten is that more than two weeks before February leaks revealed that Flynn did discuss sanctions recently imposed on Russia by the previous administration in those December phone calls with Kisylak, is that the [FBI had already listened to and cleared Flynn of any wrongdoing regarding said phone calls](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-reviewed-flynns-calls-with-russian-ambassador-but-found-nothing-illicit/2017/01/23/aa83879a-e1ae-11e6-a547-5fb9411d332c_story.html?utm_term=.f68092f7b933). Carry also seems convinced that someone else within the Trump administration ranks broke some other law regarding those phone calls, despite the fact that the FBI already clarified the opposite on January 23rd, which considering the previously cited WashPo articles, is quite evident.Just discovered the subreddit. Been thinking about this for a few years.

Does anyone else think that NPR is getting worse? Specifically more commercial and superfiscial?  I feel (might just be thinking the past is better than today) like the number of commercials playing on my local NPR radio station is more than ever and the level of conversation has gotten a lot more superfiscial.

Anyone else feel that way?It was either TED or Radiolab (I think) one of the topics was about a psychologists whose research revealed that people who were experts at something — anything at all — found extreme content-ness and peace of mind when executing their craft. 

I know I listened to it on November 5th on Sirius XM NPR (when trying to find the episode, i found only a text I sent from that date telling a friend to tune in)

It would mean a lot if someone can help me identify this. I cant find it!

Thank you!

On Friday, I made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NPR/comments/7gvy5a/npr_this_morning_gop_tax_bill_is_breaking_at_the/) to r/npr stating that the claim was made on Morning Edition of that day that the "GOP tax bill was breaking at the seams," only for WSJ to post an article an hour later saying that the Senate had enough votes to pass that same bill. The r/npr mods flared that post, "NPR didn't say that." And they're right. I was wrong. What Steve Inskeep actually said that morning was "the tax bill that passed the House and is now hanging by a thread in the Senate." He did *not* say the Senate tax bill was "breaking at the seams," he said it was "hanging by a thread." Which you can hear for yourself in [this clip](https://www.npr.org/2017/11/30/567588841/speaker-ryan-on-sexual-harassment-we-are-having-a-watershed-moment-in-this-count) starting at 7:45. The quote is not included in the transcript. So terribly sorry for the confusion.

Whose the goose? Me.During my driving for work, I burn through a lot of podcasts including the slew of NPR podcasts in my library. One that I've listened to a lot of is Pop Culture Happy Hour and I've really enjoyed it for quite a while now. My only gripe (if you can even call it that) is I would love to hear more conversations about movies and shows like this that don't have to tip-toe around spoilers. The most recent 3BB podcast is what got me thinking about it. I loved the conversation and it hit a long of topics straight on, but couldn't get into details as much as I would have liked. Any fellow listeners have additional recommendations of podcasts that might fit that bill? NPR had an interview with a historian talking about the myth that people were smaller in the past because of the small clothing in museums... But that smaller clothing made it to the present because larger garments fit more people and they were used until discarded. And this causes a false image of the past. Any help tracking down this podcast? I work with a lot of vintage groups and I mention this frequently. I'd love to share it and can't seem to track it down.David Greene had Scott Jennings on this morning to talk about Roy Moore. Jennings is a Republican political strategist based in Kentucky, and he served as special assistant to President George W. Bush.

What struck me was the following sequence with my emphasis in **bold**:

&gt; **Greene:**Moore was speaking last night at a rally in a barn in south Alabama, essentially presenting himself as part of the Trump movement. You don't sound convinced by that.

&gt;**JENNINGS:** No. In fact, there's no empirical evidence that Roy Moore would support the Trump agenda. I mean, look at what he's done so far in this campaign. No. 1, he opposed the Obamacare repeal legislation that was preferred by President Trump. No. 2, **everybody in Alabama knows Moore, in some ways, is a creation of the liberal trial bar. He's sort of bought and paid for by these guys in this and other campaigns.**

&gt;And so I don't really think we have any evidence that Moore supports Trump. I think he's doing it out of political expediency. And whereas Alabama has had two senators that have been very supportive of the Trump agenda, I think they're now going to have a wild card who really is a party of one. He's for Roy Moore. And if that intersects with Trump sometimes, fine. But I'll guarantee you, he is going to pop up and cause a problem for the Trump agenda if he makes it to Washington.

&gt;**GREENE:** I got to ask you about these liberal connections you're suggesting with Roy Moore. What are you talking about? I'm confused here.

&gt;**JENNINGS:** Well, back during the Graham-Cassidy debate over the summer, he came out and vocally opposed that. And of course, as you know, Donald Trump - this was his preferred method at one time for repealing and replacing Obamacare. **And Roy Moore takes thousands of dollars from the liberal trial lawyers in Alabama and has for a very long time.**

&gt;**So his connections to, I think, the liberal Democrats in Alabama** plus his skepticism of Donald Trump's agenda make me very worried that Donald Trump here is going to regret getting involved in this race. I support the president and want his agenda to succeed. I just don't think Roy Moore's going to help with it.

&gt;**GREENE: I should tell our listeners that this - these liberal connections and that those - that kind of money - it's not something I can confirm on live radio, what you're saying. But that's certainly interesting and not something I've heard before.** 

That this interview went to air without a real fact check (and I have been trying to find a single source) on these claims seems wrong. Why couldn't this interview be held for a few hours or days to make sure these statements could be verified. Am I expecting too much?

I just published this little Chrome extension 'MyTwoCents' that lets you put a comment section on any website - think where comments are disabled or no comment section at all but need for discussion and exchange of opinions. I saw that NPR removed their comment sections last year and thought the extension might be helpful to you. :) 

It's available here for Chrome: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mytwocents/gmcmamjffgpegfhbkbldeamchnadoick](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mytwocents/gmcmamjffgpegfhbkbldeamchnadoick)

What do you think? Happy for feedback. :)Hello NPR and Reddit!

I'm currently in DC for the next week and have loads of free time between museums and tours. Is there a way to go to a Tinydesk Concert? I've seen every one and have found many influencial bands from Tinydesk. 

Just curious, thanks for any info!The host is a young gay male who engages those who have written hate speech about him or the LGBT movement on the author's (perhaps?) podcast, show or other projects.  He brings them on and has a civil discussion about why they feel the way they do and generally the host and the guest come to an understanding in the end.  Thanks.i tried to google but nothing.. i just want to know the difference in them and what suites my interests more. thanks.Was looking for a story about how researchers interviewed average Americans and found that they were a lot more willing to cut their own spending and balance the budget than congress. I never got to hear the full story but wanted to. Was wondering if anyone knew what it was or where to find it.  I've been hearing the instrumentals of some pop songs getting played between segments of some NPR shows recently. Today I heard one that I swear I've heard before but couldn't identify. Is there any way I can listen to these again or some record of which songs were played? First, my wife and I are members (have been for 5-7 years).

It's clear from the hourly goals, that as the week progresses, they set goals that are 3-5x higher towards the end of the end, than at the beginning.

And they save back the "matching funds, but only if we hit our goal" trick until the very last 3 days.

Why not set higher goals early on, and have those matching funds gimmicks going throughout the entire pledge drive, so they can get it all over in 4 or maybe 5 days (instead of 7-8 days - or however long it is).

My wife and I have NPR on in the morning starting at 6am, until we get up around 7am, all the way through until we leave for work around 8:30 or 8:45.

2.5 hours of pledge-drives, day after day after day, gets pretty damn old after 7-8 days (and pretty much ruins lounging around in bed on Saturdays, listening to Weekend Edition for 2 hours in bed, half awake).

Is there ANY way to get this over faster?  And I've especially had it with the hyper-perky begathon-ers who go on, and on, and on about how incredibly excited they are to be reaching out for support, blah, blah, blah.

We're members, we gave, we get it, you need money.  Collect it faster, and be done with it.

At least with PBS, you can DVR stuff, and fast-forward thought the nonsense.  I'd give anything for a similar radio-based FF function, sometimes.

PS:  My wife's been home with the flu a few days this week (first time she's taken any sick-time off from work in a couple years).  Normally she'd just have NPR on all day, but not with the damn begathon every waking hour.

Maybe members should get a user-specific (member-specific) password, and be able to stream the station without all the crap during pledge-drives.

I've loved and listened to NPR my entire adult life (I'm pushing 50), but pledge-drives only seem to get worse and worse over the years.

Tell us the damn overall goal, and hold the station hostage only as long as necessary, until the goal is met, and then be done with it.  I bet if they drove home the point (on-air) that the second they met the overall goal for the week, that they'd go back to regular programming, it'd all be done in 4 days tops.

It's obvious when they raise like 50% of their money in the last 2 days of the drive, that they know how to compress the process.  Why the heck they don't do it, is beyond me.Michael Oreskes, Garrison Keillor, John Hockenberry, and now Tom Ashbrook have been confronted with serious allegations over recent months. It's becoming apparent that NPR houses a variety of abusive personalities throughout its corporate culture. 
I worry that without a transparent reckoning and reorganization, NPR will lose much of the trust and integrity it's built over the years.
Thoughts?I heard it this morning between 8:45 and 9:10am but can't find anything about it. Something about vegetarian burgers that aren't approved by the FDA. Did anyone else hear this story? If so, do you know where I can find it online?

Edit: found it

http://interlochenpublicradio.org/post/scientists-create-genetically-engineered-veggie-burger-bleedsI heard a story on the radio when I was driving in upstate NY last Friday and I'm half sure it was an npr feature, something along the lines of a series of stories called "Happy Holidays... Sort of". This author/comedian type guy told a hilarious story about what happened on Christmas when he was 8, but for the life of me I can't find the story online no matter which keywords I use. Maybe someone here heard it too and remembers who it was or what the show was called. 

The story goes something like this:

When he was a kid he thought Jesus and Santa were the same thing because he was basically raised by television. When he was eight his grandparents came to Christmas and they brought this life sized  Santa that was made of wax and foam. When they opened the door he kept yelling "it's Jesus, it's Jesus!" and his grandmother was all concerned that he wasn't getting a proper religious education. Anyway then all the adults leave the room and the kid goes up to Santa  by the Christmas tree and gives Santa a big kiss on the face. The face is made of wax and smells good, like beeswax, so it reminds him of those little wax bottle candy things that you bite the top off of and drink the sugar inside. So he starts taking BITES OFF OF SANTA'S FACE and eats off like... The lips, the eyebrows, the cheeks... And then he gets caught with Santa's massacred face and with wax all down his shirt and has to be taken to the ER to have his stomach pumped.

Anyway this story had me in stitches and I really want to find it.

Another relevant detail is that there was another, much sadder story told right before the wax Santa story, told by a woman whose mother committed suicide on Christmas.I just can't stand this guy's delivery, or his sportscaster / top 40 DJ voice. Most of the other NPR hosts manage to sound during interviews like they're actually conversing with the person being interviewed. I realize there's post producing, and editing, and it's not just a conversation that we're hearing.

But if I hadn't known that already, the last interview I just listened to him do made it painfully obvious. No nuance, it was clear he was reading from a script, or at least a written down set of questions, and that it took place well after the interview was recorded. And all in that Casey Kasem wannabe voice.

Mary Louise Kelly cannot take over soon enough.Maybe she'll sneakily ascend from sub to full-time like Rachel Martin did before her.I've been an NPR listener for years.  And every time they have a fundraising campaign they says "your source for balanced news."

What balance are they referring to?  Because it certainly isn't balanced in the sense of conservative / liberal viewpoints.  They take the liberal stance on basically every issue.  If Fox is the propaganda machine for the Trump Presidency, NPR is the same for the opposition. 

What balance are they referring to when they say this? I was listening to that interview and I don't understand why they would interview her or what she could have possibly provided. She just defended him stating that in her mind it's not possible for him to have committed any of these allegations against him, blamed Dr. Ford while purposely mistating false rape accusation statistics. If they wanted to interview someone who was just going to repeat Fox News talking points, why not at least interview someone that's more credible like a Republican Senator, congressman or someone that works at a conservative think tank rather than a random friend who said she hasn't known him since the mid 20s outside of holidays? Just struck me as an odd choice for an interview.[https://www.npr.org/2018/10/06/654857533/opinion-donald-trump-fell-in-love-with-kim-jong-un](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/06/654857533/opinion-donald-trump-fell-in-love-with-kim-jong-un)

Scott Simon is once again using his host chair to bash Trump. Scott is welcome to his opinion. However, the views of a host are magnified his/her position. Listeners give the host opinion more weight and consideration than a contributor who presents the opposing view. There are plenty of conservative contributor voices on NPR.

My rhetorical question is when does a conservative NPR host get to air their views from the NPR microphone? You know, for balance.I apologize if this has been posted before, I wasnt able to find anything.  I cant stand my local NPR station - the jouralistic quality is abysmal and I regularly have to turn it off during the drive in.  However, nationally broadcast segments (morning edition, marketplace, on point) are incredible and I still want to donate, but specifically to them.  Any thoughts on the best way to do it to make sure my dollar goes the furthest? I do not want catalogs, contact info, in a mailing list, or monthly payments; but after a pledge drive, went to the website of my local station.  There seems to be no option to simply enter a credit card number for a one-time 'cash' donation, or for that matter, bitcoin.  Is there a way?   A lot of NPR shows have corresponding podcasts (fresh air, marketplace, etc), but I'm not having much luck finding one for All Things Considered (and weekend edition). I know you can listen to shows directly from npr's site, but I like to download as a podcast so I can listen while I run, drive, etc.  I would think, given how popular all things considered is, it would have a podcast. Any ideas why it doesn't (or why I can't find it?)?Because I would have smacked Marc Lotter about the head this morning if I'd been in a studio with him. I really miss Diane Rehm, but vowed I would give Joshua Johnson's show a chance. A year (or more??) later, and I just can't. 

He's completely out of his league on big national topics and way too fluffy on other ones. He wants to offend no one and be everyone's friend. Where Ms. Rehm would strongly yet tactfully call guests and callers out when they spout misinformation, Mr. Johnson just allows them to keep rolling. He asks softball questions that get answered with pompous misdirection and blather.

I've actually written to both NPR and my local affiliate about this. The reply I received was more or less a shrug. I've been a $50/month supporter for over 20 years, but now I think my money is better spent elsewhere.I understand the need for these drives and am a monthly "subscriber", but for the life of me cannot find any  information on when the fund drive will end. Since these things are national in scope (or is this wrong?), I can't believe that they aren't programmed down to the last minute. It wouldn't seem so annoying if there was a known endpoint. Or is keeping the end vague a necessary strategy for some reason? I typically really like Joshua Johnson and 1A, but today’s first hour was just...off. Both of the guests were continuing to argue that Kavanaugh’s life was being ruined with baseless allegations, and that sexual assault is so hard to prove that we essentially should not believe women when they come forward UNLESS they can prove the assault happened.

As a survivor of sexual assault, I know that there often IS no way to prove it happened......but that means I shouldn’t be believed? I’m quite shocked at WAMU for airing this segment with these guests, and at Joshua Johnson for not calling them on what I think are very dangerous statements. It’s adding to this culture of thinking white men in this country are being persecuted, and that women are not safe to come forward with very real things that happened to them that they are likely unable to prove. I’d be interested to hear the 1A team respond to why they thought that segment would be helpful or add to a productive conversation about sexual assault and the future of the Court.https://www.npr.org/2018/10/08/655635838/whats-at-stake-for-president-trump-with-the-midterm-elections

This is such careless language. It implies Trump has been on a winning streak this entire time and let’s his self-aggrandizing lies become normalized. I’m not surprised to hear it from Liasson, but it’s still aggravating.I get being a nonpartisan news source but both of those people are cable news pundits who regularly appear on fix news, and imo, are irrelevant overused mouthpiece's for the conservative party, why are they given this much air time, today's piece sounded like a "hey conservative's you better vote or you're screwed" what new information is being delivered to the moderate listener with that? I swear NPR is being blackmailed into running pieces like this.Did anyone hear the story this morning about the Chinese birth rate being in decline at the same time the population is aging?  The government is encouraging women to have babies and buck any feminist ideas about being independent. 

This is exactly what the right is leading American women to. Mark.my.words. Does anyone know the title of the episode from Note to Self which discusses privacy vs. security and modern day issues compared to predictions in the books 1984 and Brave New World? I just heard a song played on my local station, KQED, during All Things Considered and I can’t find it on the site. 

It came after this segment 
https://www.npr.org/2018/10/09/655947234/there-is-good-news-in-the-universe-you-just-have-to-look-at-some-dirt-to-find-it

It was 5:30pm pacific. I’m pretty sure it was kpop but not 100%. Did anyone catch it? They actually played quite a bit of the song, if not all of it. 
I thought Meghna did a REALLY fantastic job narrating this. I know it's a bit off of the 'hosts+callers' kind of On Point, but I thought the local interviews were great. 

Some of the callers are very much: "I like Trump because he does  the jobs thing good" or "Well it should be known that this isn't the true will of the people because Hillary got more votes"

Just my thoughts. Sorry if this has been done before and I missed it/overlooked it. But today seemed like a genuinely great way for Meghna to conduct the show. 

Maybe I'm just missing Tom Ashbrook's voice...Anyone know the one? I googled what I think would bring it up but couldn't find it. It was KPCC around 8 or 9 pm PST.We've had reports of certain podcasting apps cutting off the end (last 15 sec or so) of some of our NPR podcasts (Pocket Casts, Apple Podcasts) but trying to get in the weeds on it. Have you experienced this? If you have, are you willing to troubleshoot with me? Appreciate if this is **just** for this problem, not others. Is 122 the only channel that does NPR/PRX programming? Its been really great for me, I was completely out of sync with my local station but now I can get on point and most importantly marketplace at 6pm on my commute home. Are there any other talk channels that use content from the typical npr contributors?A former US military serviceman called in to the first hour Week-in-the-News round-up episode today (Friday, October 12). During his service, he spent time in the Spanish dictatorship, and in Saudi Arabia, an authoritarian state.

His point was that the rhetoric coming from the Trump administration is more than just words, and that America does have something to worry... and then he was cut off.

No pretense of a bad connection, either. His line was absolutely cut.

Folkenflik responded with how unlikely it was that he would have been allowed to voice his opinion in either country.

Really, David? You censor this guy to tell him he would have been censored in these other places, and is somehow lucky to be sharing his opinion here, while simultaneously cutting him off?

&amp;#x200B;

NPR doesn't let anything slip about how, when, and why they cut callers off, but it is undeniable to say that they don't curb certain opinions (I'm not referencing that guy who called in some several weeks ago, and was complaining about a Jewish conspiracy).

I don't know if these standards come down from ~~underwriters~~ advertisers, management, or if when to censor is up to each host, but this guy had a non-confrontational tone, was speaking clearly, had a fine connection, and was sharing an opinion that a lot of people agree with--not just me--and is grounded in historical fact.

I can't say I recall something this blatant ever happening before, and it absolutely bothered me. It was a good reminder about how NPR might not be cable news, but it definitely wants to restrict the opinions &amp; voices its listeners get to hear.

Can't say I regret not having been a member of my local station for quite a few years now.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Folkenflik censored a caller because he was comparing Trump to a proto-dictator.Anybody else bothered by the way Scott Horsley pronounces Fritos?I was curious to hear some thoughts about the recent Code Switch Episode "Our Homeland Is Each Other". A friend sent it to me since my husband and I are wanting to adopt in the next few years. We have always been open to a transracial adoption, but this episode made me second guess that decision. It seemed to imply that white parents are doing children of color a disservice by adopting them into white homes. Of course there are extremely important factors that must be considered when adopting, and white parents adopting transracially must be aware there are situations their children will face that the parents have never experienced.

&amp;#x200B;

Naturally, we all listen to episodes with our own pasts and biases so I am well aware that I listened to this feeling defensive of our decision to adopt transracially. I wanted to see what other listeners thought as well!I listen to podcasts every day and I can't stand some ads. I know what I dislike personally, but I was hoping that this community could help me understand things to avoid when interrupting an NPR podcast. (And also if there are suggestions for things to 100% do, that would also help!)I've searched the NPR databases, and can't find it anywhere.  Basically it was, I believe On Point, that had a lengthy interview with the former head of a libertarian thinktank/research company.  In the interview, he spoke about libertarianism being a basically unworkable philosophy, and was candid about how the political platform was no longer viable in the US.

Any ideas?There was a program that I heard around a week or two ago discussing the political climate (that narrows it down, right?).

Anyway, the speaker--I think a professor or author-- was talking about what influences people's opinions.  She said something along the lines of: liberal activists need to understand that shaming doesn't work to change people. *Guilt* may work but shame does not.

I want to say this was Joshua Jackson's program, but I'm not sure.  Does anyone remember the particular broadcast or who the interviewee was? 

Thanks.Hello fellow public radio fans. I am in need of help. I recently purchased a wine club subscription as a wedding present for a friend of mine, and am having it delivered after her wedding. However I wanted to write a letter to include in the envelope that was NPR themed and punny. Can you kind humans help me out? so after I switched my default podcast player to spotify i had a hard time finding hidden brain and TED Radio Hour podcasts. It just didn't show up in the results. I did see other NRP podcasts like The Indicator From Planet Monkey, Believed, Bullseye and Latino USA.

why is TED &amp; Hidden Brain unavailable?

EDIT: i noticed that there is Hidden Brain on spotify but [it's episodes are not available](http://imgur.com/a/RrokwDe) There's certain segments that I really enjoy, but I'm guessing you can't have "on demand" radio because of licensing agreements.

&amp;#x200B;

Here in Alabama, for instance, we have All Things Acoustic- and they play great music. They're cool about posting the playlists online, but I'd really love to have the music and the DJ too, really nice segment to chill out to. Podcasts and radio dramas are fun and all, but the music and dj are why I love radio. The playlist is back! At least for iOS. Our long national nightmare is over.Dear NPR,

I've subscribed to NPR's podcasts and feeds for many years. I consider NPR THE source for my daily news.

Imagine my shock and disappointment when, 2-3 days ago, NPR News Now stopped working (downloading) completely. I visited NPR's site, recopied the link, and updated my podcast aggregator. To no avail!

The disappointment doesn't end there. This morning (Sunday), I opened my RSS feed reader, scanned the headlines, found one of interest, clicked it, and was meet with this:

&gt;"By choosing “I agree” below, you agree that NPR’s sites use cookies, similar tracking and storage technologies, and information about the device you use to access our sites to enhance your viewing, listening and user experience, personalize content, personalize messages from NPR’s sponsors, provide social media features, and analyze NPR’s traffic.

&gt;"Agree and Continue Revoke Agreement Decline and Visit Plain Text Site
NPR’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy."

WTH, NPR?

How am I supposed to download content for my feed subscriptions when, CLEARLY, an interaction has to happen in order to do so?

My current feeds from NPR are currently chock full of these spammy TOS messages and news from NPR is inaccessible.

Not everyone visits your site via web browser. Assuming so results in the technical issues I described (above).

The question now becomes, Will NPR fix this issue or will NPR start losing daily RSS readers and Podcast listeners?

This is really disappointing. I hold NPR in very high regard, but this changes how I interact with NPR. It changes it in a way that is incompatible with my convenience, my time, and the availability of information from, what I consider to be, a trusted source of information.

Please don't abuse that trust.

I'm glad NPR brought the playlist back to their app, without it, their app was not very useful to me. 

The new playlist they brought back is *still* not as functional as the old one. On the old playlist, you can add segments from the last 3 episodes. On the new one, you can **only** add segments from the latest show. I was one of those vocal people who tweeted &amp; emailed NPR when the playlist was removed, and I participated in the user testing they did for the new playlist. I had mentioned that being able to add segments from multiple days was a critical component for me. 

This may seem minor, but I found being able to add segments from previous shows very useful. There are lots of times when a certain topic (politics, mass shooting etc.) dominates the show, and there will only be 1-2 segments which aren't related to that topic. Being able to add segments from several days means you can create a playlist with more content related to what you want to hear about that isn't the main focus of the day. 

The point of adding a new feature should be that it is *better* than the previous iteration, not worse. NPR should allow the playlist to play segments from **several** previous shows. 

Until that happens, I've reverted back to my old app. 

Anyone else tried the new playlist?What did you all think? Personally, I was really excited to see this one be put out as it pertains to my own research interests. I thought it was decent at weighing both sides of the dilemna of Narcan... although it wasn’t without bias. I definitely thought it weighed more on one side sometimes. Also, I like how they brought up how we don’t know much about addiction works, but I wish we explored that topic more. Overall, I really enjoyed it and thought it was a very relevant topic!I'm pretty sure I didn't imagine it but there was a segment with an EU person saying  something like "I understand his logic but it is not my logic" and then later said something like "since medieval times".  I've checked both Morning Edition and Here and Now...and also searched on Jean-Claude Juncker...Hello, i mostly listen to NHPR and I noticed that, I believe on sundays, there’s sometimes a live comedic show from an older man who I’m pretty  sure is from Minnesota, the whole thing is kinda “Alice’s Restaurant” like. If anyone has a name of the Host or any info on the show, I’d appreciate it!She sounds a little like Laura Linney. She reads the advertisements or sponsors. Her voice is awesome. I can’t believe she just does ads!Why is this app so atrocious with data usage? I used to listen to spotify day in and day out and never went above 2.5gigs of data usage. I started listening to NPR one halfway through last month INSTEAD of spotify and used 8 (yeah 8) gigs of data without any other changes in my data usage (leading to 2 gigs of overage charges). 

Please optimize data usage for this app because I can't really afford the 30 bucks a month in overage charges to get my news. It was probably on Morning Edition &amp; it talked about people who were addicted to giving to charity. Specifically about a couple who lived quite frugally in order to give every penny they could. The wife, in particular, had bouts of depression because she didn't think it was enough or thought the couple could do more &amp; have less, but the husband had his addiction a bit more under control. Or it may have been that he wasn't addicted at all. 

Any help in finding this story is greatly appreciated. I've noticed that NPR generally seems to require their presenters to speak without obvious regional accents. But lately I've noticed that quite a few presenters and correspondents drop the first R in "forward". The odd thing is that I cannot identify any other regionalisms in the speech of those who do it. I've heard it might be an NYC/Connecticut-ism but can't find anything definite. I wonder if I am only noticing this because I live in an area where the regional accent is more rhotic? I've lived in several areas of the US with their own regional dialects and never noticed this before recently.Does anyone else have this happen? There's at least 2 or three shows that I follow that don't show up under "followed shows". Anyone know how to fix this?I was a contestant on Wait, Wait a few years ago. I never submitted my greeting request so I recently asked them if the offer was still valid. Of course it was (because they are so nice) so I put in the request. Got an email yesterday that due to continued illness Carl is no longer able to record 😪🙏 so I can choose from anyone else connected with the show. I am torn between Peter and Paula. Also, does anyone have a good idea what to say? Little disappointed that NPR invited Kayleigh Mcenany this morningEDIT: Nevermind. It looks like I found it.

https://www.npr.org/2018/03/16/593872337/radio-what-was-not-said

I was driving from southern California to northern California yesterday. In the middle of my trip I was looking for a public radio station. I found one, and a program was on that seemed like Snap Judgement, RadioLab, or This American Life. Wasn't sure though.

I listened to two segments for about 30 minutes before the signal cut out. The first was about strained relationship of the son of a Taiwanese woman who eventually had a fellow Taiwanese stranger take care of her, which affected the son's relationship with his mother for years.

The second, (the one I was more fascinated by) was about a woman who grew up having dealt with a habit of Maladaptive Daydreaming. I was really interested in her story, but I couldn't finish it since the radio cut out. Later, I tried finding the name of the show or segments online, but I wasn't successful. 

So I'm wondering if anyone here might be able to help me find what I'm searching for. Thanks.Wish people would stop doing this and just state their opinion or ask their question. Seems like a lot of people do this and I don’t understand why. Usually results in an awkward pause or the same “good, you’re on ___ go ahead”. Just seems very uneccesary. is it a career path from transportation correspondent/reporters to journalist, commentators, host?I love Tamara Keith and Scott Detrow. And Asma as well as other regular contributors. They are top notch - the best politics podcast on the air in my opinion. 

But I wish Sam would come back. He brought a lightness that was really nice especially with such heavy topics. Is he gone from the show permanently? I still need to check out the podcast he hosts, *It's Been a Minute*. So I'm sitting in my driveway listening to Marketplace, it's an after work ritual of mine. And as I sit taking in to the docet tones and rhythmic cadence of Kai Ryssdal's voice when I realized I've never seen what this person looks like. 

The phrase "lets do the numbers" followed by that smooth, elating jazz and staccato rundown of the market that day is so comforting to me. It's as if, when I hear it, that I know all is well with the world. Somehow it's like the thing that lets me know the sun will rise again tomorrow, 

anyway I realized I'd never seen a picture of this guy and with my recent surprising experience of what Ari Schapiro looks like I looked him up excitedly. And well instead of another shock... He just LOOKS EXACTLY like how I thought! You know, like a square jawed white businessman right? 

Yeah 
That's actually, that's totally right. Yeah. Haha yeah. I've been an NPR listener for more than two decades and support my local station. But has anyone else noticed that within the past year, hosts on programs (ATC and Morning Edition in particular), have just started shutting the guest down due to time constraints? What happened to politely warning the guest; "in the few seconds remaining" or something similar? Or even apologizing politely over top of them by letting them know; "sorry, but we'll have to leave it there for now".

Simply cutting someone off in a curt and  aggressive way really sounds crass, rude and uncharacteristic of NPR.Hey my name is Kyle Johnson and I am a student at Coastal Carolina University conducting a study on NPR and political opinion.  I posted a link to my survey here a few weeks ago and so many people were so helpful and completed it, but I need just a few more to reach my required sample size of 50.  If just a few people could help out and take it, that would be amazing.  Thanks!

After about 17 years of loyal listening, I don't feel like NPR is for me anymore. I'll spare you the bitching about changes and content that seems dumber, &amp; etc.

I'm looking for more diverse global news, more culture, history, arts coverage, and less (what I see as) emotion baiting. 

I'm looking at CBC and BBC, do any of you have suggestions of daily news sources I could be missing?

Thank you!They are killing me with this update.  Every night I set up a playlist and press play while in bed.  It is calming and interesting to lay down and listen to the stories only that interest you in the order that you want to hear them.
I can’t even use the app anymore without this.  Who has the time to listen to a three minute segment and then search for another one and listen to that and repeat over and over?  
Absolutely brutal.
Also on the help screen they mention that they got rid of playlists because only a few people were using it.  Is that true???  How the hell did anyone else use the app?  2 minutes at a time, pressing play over and over?  
Sorry for the rant but the app is what got me listening to npr in the first place.  Does anyone know if a list exists of "The Wire"\-related interviews on "Fresh Air" over the years? I know Terry Gross was a big fan. I'd love to work my way through the interviews, starting with the oldest.

I've found several interviews by searching and see the online episode archive that I could laboriously check through, but was hoping there was already a comprehensive list somewhere. Thanks!He was reading a listeners quote, talking about Kanye's recent outbursts, and the listener ended by referring to Kanye by his nickname, Ye, which is pronounced 'yay,' but Joshua pronounced it as 'yee,' and that just made me crash my car into oncoming traffic, killing myself and many others.I have an iPhone 7 and most of the time (not always) when the NPR One app goes to the next segment the audio on my Bluetooth headset or speaker stops while the segment keeps playing. I have to hit pause then play to get the audio going again. I’ve had this issue for awhile and was hoping it would just go away with an update, but it’s still happening. Does anyone else have this issue?Does NPR have a conflict of interest since they are partly funded by local and state governments alongside the federally funded Corporation of public broadcasting?  I know they also receive funds from on air pledges, corporate underwriting and other avenues, but I can't help but question their relationship with the government.  

If I worked for NPR I think I would favor whichever political party and candidate was more likely to fund my organization.  But then I also think that would make me an unethical journalist...What were your thoughts, if so? 
As a 911 operator, I have many thoughts on this episode. I’m in search of a book I heard about on Morning Edition a few weeks ago. I can’t remember the author, but it was about democracy and how/why some of the things we do as a society don’t make sense. I was driving so I didn’t get a chance to write it down, and then it has just totally eluded me since then. Any help would be appreciated! Did anyone catch that this morning? What was it about?I heard a small piece of an interview today on the Takeaway, with a woman who used to (or currently?) writes an advice column, and there was mention of her being the child of an alcoholic. I'd like to listen to the interview, but I can't find what I'm looking for on their site.

Does anyone know who the guest was, or have a link to it?I'm just starting to get back into running and heard about it on All Things Considered a couple weeks ago and can't find it for the life of me:
It treats you as the 'nameless' main character caught in some conspiracy that encourages you to keep running. I believe it's set in London or elsewhere in the UK. I haven't listened to NPR as much as I use to, but are there any current event shows that are long format like the Diane Rehm show? I enjoyed the fact that she spent thirty minutes or an hour on one subject. I learned so much as far as current events. I guess the closet thing is Fresh Air, but the segments are short and Terry Gross usually only has one guest on. I really enjoy the panel format. Thanks.I'm posting this here because I'm pretty sure it was an episode of This American Life, but I'm not sure. They talked about Michael Rosen and how when people made [memes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTonc3Ql8AM) about of his videos, he was upset because he makes videos for children, and these memes were really inappropriate. He was concerned because they would come up when people searched his name, and he was worried kids would find them. I think he might've tried to get people to take them down at first, but then someone sent him an email and he changed his mind. I don't remember what the theme was, but it was definitely a smaller part of a larger episode. I can't find anything about it anywhere. Please help! I pretty sure I listened to it over winter break, so maybe December 2017- January 2018? It is really bugging me! Thanks!I have the NPR "skill" and the NPR One app and have tried using the suggested commands like "ask npr one to play morning edition" etc...  But it's just so clumsy usually doesn't work. I wish I could control it from my NPR app or some other app. Spotify works great with the Echo but doesn't have these programs. Does anyone have any suggestions?I miss him.The first NPR personality I'd noticed using the (to me obnoxious) "Hmm." was Steve Inskeep. Now it seems like it become a universal habit that all NPR interviewers use and abuse. It makes them sounds petty and schoolmarm-ish. I just wish that instead of the passive-aggressive "Hmm" they'd simply challenge the nonsense or ask a more-to-the point followup question. Does anyone else feel like the high fidelity microphones being used in NPR's studios are too good? I can often hear the sounds of the announcers' tongues moving around in their mouths as they enunciate their words. It can be disconcerting once you notice it.This series by embedded has been pretty phenomenal so far and it's about a topic that has been in the news a lot lately thanks to our current president. Definitely worth a listen.

[https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510311/embedded](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510311/embedded) I don't have an exact timeline of these events at hand, so call me out me if you have more details. Just thought this might be an issue worthy of further investigation.It seems like a lot of functionality was lost in the overhaul of the iOS app.Forgive me for not having the name of the show. I'm not normally in my car at the hour that I heard it. I tried searching the NPR site but can't seem to locate the program or quote.

For context, I believe it was between 15:00\-16:00 central on Friday. The man was speaking with a female anchor in a news\-style program on the topic of Trump's recent clarification on his "animals" remark. The man said something to the effect of my title, implying that even with context people will still use it in a way that suits their bias. The quote was able to articulate something I had trouble doing myself and I'd appreciate the ability to save it.It was a story about a man who had epilepsy who got married to a coworker he had shared rides with, had a surgery to remove a part of his brain (because of the epilepsy reoccurring,) and then he did some pretty dark stuff.   I was on my way to the bank from work and a few other places so I missed a lot of it but the part of his brain that controls impulses was essentially missing.  He was arrested for downloading illegal pornography, and shortly after is where I had to stop listening.   

If anyone knows what I'm talking about please help me out!   I really wanted to hear the whole thing but my local affiliate had a completely different show on the schedule for that day so I don't even know what program it was.

Thank you in advance!

EDIT:   THANK YOU u/BIOcrumpet !!!!Driving home from Austin 3 weekends ago and a podcast came on that was crazy and I can’t find it or remember the subject.

Basically there was a prominent eastern German woman who spoke out against the Political party. They weren’t able to arrest her because it would make them look bad. She was spied on constantly and they did things like move things in her apartment to make her think she was crazy in hopes she would snap. After the Berlin Wall came down she inquired about finding and reading her file that the Stasi had on her. Instead of there being a report it was like an entire shopping cart full of stuff. She read it and found out one of her friends was informing inner so she calls him and confronts him about it. He ends up killing himself and this was apparently s big trend back then. She also confronts the Stasi officer that launched the investigation on her and feels bad for him.

Anybody have any clue what or who I’m talking about?!!

Edit: Stasi not SSCan anyone tell me the outro song to the "Snap Judgement" segment? I was half listening but the lyrics go: "Yesterday was lonely". I have felt this for sometime and never knew who else to ask about it.

I am specifically referring to the story today about a Pakistani High School exchange student and a story a few weeks back about Somalis in Oklahoma.

I will try to find links to the audio. I feel the host was condescending when speaking about the topic. I was wondering if anyone else gets that from the NPR hosts.

For example when speaking about the Pakistani teenager he made it sound like Pakistanis do not travel abroad for education. How does this host not know that well off people from all over the planet go to the US for education?  

Also he made a comment about this student escaping violence in Pakistan. That statement could not be further from the truth. The teenager was not escaping violence was just going to a 1 year high school exchange program.  Are they playing the sensationalism card?

Another host talked about Somalis in Oklahoma and how they were waiting for a hate crimes trial.  The host talked about the Somalis like they were childern. He made the Somalis sound like they are afraid of social media and how elderly Somalis are out of touch with social media (and if we know anyone about old people is that they love to use social media regardless of their ethnic group).

Anyone else feel this way?That’s my favorite question posed by Terry of all time.Anyone else listen to Doug Fabrizio?

Man, that guy is really awesome I mean his style and finesse right?!

His main podcast is called Radio West.Like, usually they give them some heads up, wtf happened?I think it's great!  Nicknames that are On Point like that are a real breath of Fresh Air.Nintendo Wii Shop music. Had a double take while driving to work 😂😂😂How awesome!! Just wondering, I know a lot of people thought she retired entirely, but she still does a podcast once a week which is essentially the same show, just less frequent.I'm on Android Oreo and since about a week ago the programs list view doesn't work. Error message says "check connection try again", but other pull down options (topics/top stories) seem to work fine. Happens on both wifi and mobile data. Reinstalling didn't help.

Anyone else has this? Curious timing seems to coincide with the ios app redesign.There was a broadcast of this story and for the life of me I cannot remember the show name but there was two guys talking about some of the Hurricane Katrina damage and Memorial Hospital and their moral choices.
Help me! A couple of months ago there was an interview with a writer who worked very hard to speak with a group of border patrol agents. He noted that many of the agents pushed him away but their boss invited him in and gave him surprising access. He told him about carrying a dead body miles across the desert among other stories. And he asked that the author tell the truth about what he finds or something powerful like that.

I'm having trouble finding this interview. Does anyone remember this interview who might be able to link me to it? I appreciate any help you can give.I’m trying to find a recent NPR story or talk show interview about how women can avoid becoming entrapped in abusive relationships.

The show might have been Fresh Aire or On Point?

The guest was remarkably thoughtful and poignant. Two very excellent bits of advice I can recall:

1) dont become completely dependent on your partner’s friends. It’s hard to break off if you also lose all your friends and those friends may report back to your partner. Develop a second circle of good friends that is separate from your partner... people loyal to you that you can trust to support you in your moment of need.

2) don’t become completely financially dependent on your partner. Keep a savings fund that can enable you to break off and start over. This will give you strength and courage to stand your ground against unreasonable demands.

Anyway, if you recognize the message, I would really appreciate a lead to the show, the guest, or similar quality advice.

Thanks!I wanted to add All Things Considered and Morning Edition to my podcast app. Unfortunately, the official podcast feed only returns the last 15 stories, which generally doesn't cover an entire day for All Things Considered or Morning Edition.

About two years ago, I wrote a tiny open-source web app, [nrfeed](https://github.com/pyther/nrfeed), that uses the NPR api to return a podcast feed that contains the latest 50 episodes. Anyways to share this, again. Hopefully someone finds useful. And of course this is unofficial and is in no way affiliated with NPR.

I have heard rumblings that she will not have guests that are strong supporters of Palestine or even notable Arab activists. Hi all, 

I listened to an episode of Fresh Air recently on holiday and right at the end of the episode they had a guest female singer who it sounded to me was playing ukulele and she sang quite an emotional song that was 6+ minutes. 

I’ve tried searching and can’t find it nor for the life of my remember which episode it was. 

Does anyone remember what episode it was? I think she might also have been a guest on the show. 

I know I listened to it on 08/18 so it won’t be an episode more recent than that! 

ThanksSo I was listening to NPR a few nights ago and was hearing an article about political involvement in America and how we need to go back to local, grassroots movements. She kept repeating the sentence “Join a club” as the best option. Can yall help me figure out what article that was???
Edit: i was listening on WMFE OrlandoSo I use podcast addict and I can no longer get either of these programs. I can't find them when I search for them and the ones I had stopped updating over a month ago. I thought this was only a podcast addict thing, but I just downloaded Google podcasts and found the same problem. Npr one appears to have them, but you can't download the stories, just stream them and that doesn't work for me either.

Who listens to these programs currently and how are you getting them? It aired yesterday, I caught the tail end of it. Don't have any of the names but the author was talking about his book and used the term fake fixes. They were debating us politics, it was a really good exchange. 

I'm aware this is very vague. The 1a site only has one segment from that episode. Many thanks!Just got an email saying that the playlist feature is coming back in the fall, and I could not be more excited.  It's so frustrating having to individually queue up stories when I'm trying to safely drive!  I'm sitting at the kitchen table listening to the weekly roundup, and suddenly I hear a jam from the past. They were discussing the response of every white house staffer to the anonymous NYT oped: it wasn't me!

 I think it's the producers choosing the music, correct me if I'm wrong.https://www.npr.org/2018/09/10/644848324/our-last-reading-list-of-the-summer-takes-us-outside

This story from yesterday was really interesting to me, but I had to shut it off halfway and read it later online because the reporter’s voice was so distracting that I couldn’t concentrate on the words.

Is this a particular regional accent that I should just get used to?  Is it what people call “vocal fry”?Sorry in advance i don't have much to go on but

 Maybe a week or two ago there was a small segment speaking on how people are willing to spend, or act in ways for absolutely no gain, just so that someone else will have less. 

Any ideas? Thanks OMG it was like an hour long commercial for the Ford F-150. It seemed like one of those magazine articles that in small print at the bottom it says "This is an Advertisement". I am really beginning to question a lot of the programs on NPR when they start talking to someone from a big company and it pretty much turns into a 5 or 10 minute advertisement for that company. 1. NPR loves disaster porn stories. Hosts are always asking people, "What's it like to lose everything?"
2. NPR allows far too many people to get away with, "Well, these severe storms / weather are just part of a natural cycle, but they don't have anything to do with climate change. Climate change isn't even real as far as I know."
3. Hosts &amp; reporters never ask interviewees if they think climate change is (partially-)responsible for the the abnormally severe effects of a storm, flood, fire, etc.
4. Likewise, NPR never asks victims of said CC-influenced disasters how they voted, and if those votes have somehow created or impacted their present circumstances. And before anyone tries to reply with, "Well, that would be insensitive at a time when their family just lost their house / etc.", I direct you to my first point, where hosts are always  asking questions like, "You're house is flooded, everything you own is gone, what are you feeling right now?"
5. The Army Corps of Engineers spokesperson is almost always let off in an interview when discussing the fallout of one of their monumentally stupid projects. (Check out [Le Show](http://www.wwno.org/post/le-show-week-september-9-2018). Shearer has a segment, 'Let Us Try: the Ballad of the Army Corps of Engineers'.)I set the volume on my radio or phone to an acceptable level, and then when the ~~underwriters~~ commercials come on, my ears feel invaded.

&amp;#x200B;

There used to be laws against this across all TV and radio, but they died a quiet death.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I wrote "underwriters" then crossed it out in my post, and replaced it with commercials, as a bit of sarcasm. NPR calls their "commercials" "underwriters", but they're definitely commercials--at least advertisements produced by... advertisers. Some listeners have perhaps taken the ~~PR bait~~ bullshit spin and adjusted their own terminology to match that of NPR's management.

&amp;#x200B;

This doesn't happen during the podcasts. It happens when I am listening on the radio--like a real radio, or through my radio app.After the Up First coverage of Hurricane Florence they said that anyone who was looking for info, but had a weak or slow signal could access a light-weight version of the website. Yesterday they said it was "thin.npr.org" and today they said something else. Anyone else hear this, and have a theory on why the subdomain changed? You would think it would be best to keep it consistent, no?These stories happened all in a row:

*A bunch of guys dressed as mariachis gunned down people in LA and escaped on motorcycles. [Edit: as pointed out below this was in Mexico City.]

*A a scientist plead guilty to leaking secrets to the Chinese.

*A new weather "laser satellite" was launched.

So clearly China launched a hacked laser satellite using an American contact. Whoever our heroes are had to put on mariachi outfits to escape surveillance but something went wrong and they got in a gunfight in public. Needing program info!  Saturday Sept. 15th around 7pm.  The host and his band played a nice ensemble rendition of In the Hall of the Mountain King.  Then a comedy skit with a girl who couldn't rhyme, followed by an amazing song with a female lead vocal.   Any help at all would be greatly appreciated! It was with a country/folk music artist, male, I think they were contestants on America's Got Talent or The X Factor. Not only an interview but the artist performed too, along with a female singer before him. If it helps I'm on KEDT 90.7. Don't want to spoil it for everyone.   I heard this piece about a year ago but it was back on.   I was stoked because I tell this story to anyone who is interested.   It was on around 3 or 4pm eastern on my local affiliate.   Does anyone know what program this was?


EDIT:  FOUND IT!   It was called "Oops" by Radiolab from 2010(?)
https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/91721-oops/I immediately thought of the song when I saw the title. :)Amongst the other incredibly stupid things [Mona Charen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Charen#Bibliography) said was that, "She \[Ford\] is not a rape survivor."

&amp;#x200B;

I found it infuriating. Charen said it to delegitimize Ford's experience, and downplay Kavanaugh's (alleged) behavior.Like right now, on "the Takeaway" - they are discussing the "me-too" movement, and how men accused can make amends and come back in their career. (Loui CK, "the Takeaway's John Huckabee", etc) 

Right now, they are interviewing a lady for her opinions on the subject framed by Judaism (who gives a clear expectation how they could re-establish their status), and who *unsurprisingly* hasn't found anyone yet to meet that criteria. 

I doubt they will give any other perspective, let alone contrary perspectives, but I'll update if they do. 

Its just unbearable.  I used to enjoy these shows, but now its like they are preaching to the choir.  No way any conservative would listen to this.  I can't even listen to it, ***and I agree with what they are saying!*** 

I miss shows like "The Diane Rehm" and "Science Friday" - which explore topics which aren't controversial and which are interesting for everyone. It used to be Thursdays on ATC for years and years and years (80's - at least mid 00's--or maybe they stopped just a few years ago), and now nothing. Also, nothing about it on the website.

&amp;#x200B;

edits for clarityIt's a self-made commercial promoting their own station, and they run it at least twice an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

Why? Why run it constantly? It frustrates me to no end to hear this repetition.Can't find it on the NPR One App or online.I don’t know if it’s the constant adverts for “smart speakers,” the bourgeois “NPR wine club” or that they use twice as many conservative sources than left leaning sources (recent fair.org study), but more and more I feel like NPR isn’t trying to help anything but maintaining the rich white status quo. I mean it was fairly obvious in the lead up to the 2016 election that they were taking sides, but then there has been the hyper-normalization of Trump, The GOP, the alt right and this civility policing that has really made me sick. They had a literal nazi on not long ago and had him “rank the races,” and then balanced it by comparing him to Black Lives Matter. Instead of listening to their viewers they didn’t apologize but doubled down on why they did it. I’m fed up with NPR because they are biased, they have picked sides, and are shaping a specific narrative for the country. When Michelle Wolff is treated with less dignity and respect than Sarah Sanders then I’m done. Anyone else just tired of NPR?[https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain](https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain)Pass the popcorn, please...[https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/09/25/647531500/taken-for-a-ride-doctor-injured-in-atv-crash-gets-56-603-bill-for-air-ambulance](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/09/25/647531500/taken-for-a-ride-doctor-injured-in-atv-crash-gets-56-603-bill-for-air-ambulance)

&amp;#x200B;

Should be something like "Doctor unconvincingly feigns ignorance about medical billing"I have heard this multiple times in the past few weeks when it didn't seem warranted.  The caller is clear as day and the host interrupts and then tries to paraphrase the comment or question,  (usually poorly) and blames the call quality.  It seems like some hosts use this as an excuse whenever the caller's comment does not perfectly fit the flow of the conversation or if time is running out.  Anyone else noticing this tactic?  Most of the time the callers are much more clear than some of the guests who sound like they are in a submarine off the coast of Antarctica. I cringe every time. I feel like it's totally inappropriate For the second time in about a month, I'm listening to a story on Marketplace Morning report, and go to to check it on the thier website (fully understanding the distinction between NPR/APM/Marktplace etc) and there's no mention of it. There's another Marketplace Morning Report segment that aired earlier in the morning, but it pretends like that was *the* show today, and doesn't acknowledge this other story. 

Today's example was an Andy Uhler report on the effect of E-verify on Texan employers. But the only segment I can find online is with Ralph Nader and the Tort museum. Earlier this month it was a segment on public transit infrastructure, that I ultimately tracked down in a different format from a member station, but it never seemed to show up at marketplace.org. Our local NPR station (Tri-States Public Radio) in Macomb, Illinois has just been informed they are losing all of their funding from Western Illinois University. This is approximately half of their yearly budget so they are desperately reaching out to the community for help. While they have gotten over 150 new members since starting their pledge drive, they are still projecting massive budget shortfalls and probable program cuts and reduction of staff. 
This station is the only public radio station in the tri-states area and provides NPR programs for tens of thousands of people in many small, rural communities. It is very important to us and we're trying all we can to preserve it. 
If you value what public radio offers and have an extra dollar or two, please pledge and help us keep TSPR alive!

If Felicity Jones can play [RBG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Basis_of_Sex), Poundstone can play Feinstein.How many more possible "Bill" puns can they think of? I -think- it was the Diane Rehm Show, anyway. I believe this was when the Curiosity launch was happening? But there was a segment about (IIRC) Bach's Mass in B Minor and the Chinese zither piece High Mountain Flowing Water being selected as potential introductions to human culture for making contact with aliens.

I can't find it now and am wondering if I hallucinated it. It may have been about time capsules and not about aliens.Idk if I'm looking in the wrong area but I can't find any posters on their website. Just looking for a cool NPR poster for my house, preferably Tiny desk, all songs considered or this American lifeI was only in the car a few minutes and I'm not sure what show I was listening to.  There was a song, maybe by a rapper, that started off about his car breaking down on the highway, but the song remained optimistic.  I think the band featured before this song was maybe called Producers?  All i know is the scrap of paper I quickly scribbled on reads, "record producers and break down song".  But this little info hasn't been enough for me to find the music again.  Probably heard it 1-3 weeks ago.  Its unlikely, but maybe someone here can help?  Thanks!Hello,

I am relocating, and my commute will change from a drive to a subway ride, so I won't be able to listen to All Things Considered on my way home since cell service in the tunnels is spotty. 

Are there any good podcasts that similar to ATC, in that they cover the day's events in a serious and brief manner? I like decompressing on my way home while going over what happened today. 

Thanks!A couple weeks ago, (less than 6 I think), I caught a few minutes of a story in which they were interviewing I think a candidate for current (or maybe previous?) elections in either house or senate, and he was talking about being targeted by the DCCC after he started criticizing other democrats in primary debates, and I think for the way he didn't take corporate money.

I've been trying to find this story myself, but every time I search for dccc and primary, I get flooded with primary results. Please let me know if you have any details on the story or know where I can find the whole thing.I understand the World Cup is a big thing and all, but come on, when you guys report the results, can’t there be a heads up that the result is about to be spoiled? I can’t watch some games that are in the middle of the day so I record them to watch at home and two games have been spoiled cause the results were given on my drive homeI'm listening to NPR right now and they are airing a NATO press conference live. This is not a priority or really news worthy.  A lot, not all, of their segments around politics seem to involve someone from some think-tank giving opinions they're literally paid to hold. I'm not really sure how  is helps people stay informed on policies when so many of their segments are surface level opinion commentary paired with moment to moment coverage of events without reporting on events that aren't in the headlines.I like hearing many different people rotating through the host's chair, but I suspect--please correct me if I am wrong-- that the decision to not hire a full-time host is a slick way to save \~$240,000 by giving *per diem* allotments to hosts who sometimes only sit in the chair one day a week. Yes, sometimes they host all five days.

By the way, [Tom Ashbrook was paid through June](http://www.wbur.org/news/2018/02/14/tom-ashbrook-dismissed).

Okay, yes; I made a mistake. On Point was created by and is produced by WBUR. it seems like I'm getting the same stories when going to work and leaving work. Is the only difference that their updated if something has happened during the day that is super newsworthy and generally that's just updates that I end up hearing in the morning anyway. So just wondering if there's any other differences cause I'm thinking of listening to another news podcast one one of my drives to widen my news net.There are so many quibbles, I don't know where to start...

I am constantly raging at public radio for lacking the courage to ask follow-up questions of their guests. Why don't they have the mental fortitude to continue pressing home on a bullshit point? I know they have limited time for each segment, but that isn't an excuse for not pressing on some empty talking point, or perhaps (!) not even inviting the (almost always  conservative) guest back on the show (usually ME, ATC).

We hear from so many conservative think tanks, magazines, journals, etc, but why don't we hear from equally progressive news outlets? When was the last time we heard someone from *The Nation* be interviewed? Why does Jonah Goldberg get that sweet Monday morning spot for 5 minutes?

Why do I feel that NPR's main objective is to maintain the status quo?

What other gripes about the news sausage do folks have?

It might be apocryphal, but the quote, ["The CIA owns everyone of any significance in the major media"](https://www.metabunk.org/debunked-the-cia-owns-everyone-of-any-significance-in-the-major-media.t158/) rings true to me.

(Right, we're supposed to trust the CIA. Sure.)I spend almost every Sunday morning going down Tiny Desk rabbit holes. There are so many performances from so many performers in so many genres that it can be overwhelming. Somehow I’ll end up watching a band that doesn’t even sing in a language that I understand and loving every second of it. I know I can’t be the only one that does this. They keep describing illegal aliens who sneak across the border as "immigrants". They can't pronounce the truth. They also never say a good word about the president despite his obviousl successes.

Who in the world believes NPR? It is only for low information people who are not too intelligent, and not too educated.Hello. I’ve been racking my brain and exhausting  my google search skills over a show that featured three younger people talking about finances, and then at the end they take calls and give financial advice. Can anybody help identify it? Thanks!All I remember is that the song was about a cat- I'm not sure if the cat was referenced as "cat" or "kitty". The vocals were female. I think it sounded like an older song, as in quite a few decades old, but to be honest I can't be sure. And I can't even remember the lyrics! I just remember that I heard it, and liked it, and meant to look it up but never did...

It is *not* "The Cat Came Back"- that's the only song I've really been able to find trying to google this with such little information. 

I only ever heard the song once, and like I said, it was many years ago. Probably between 7-10 years ago. For some reason it's been popping into my head lately driving me crazy. 

Anyway, this is just one of those weird things that bugs you, you know? So since I've been unsuccessful with Google, I thought I'd throw out a shot in the dark and ask you fine folks. 

Thanks in advance for any brain power any of you throw at it, even if it lends no results!! 

**EDIT**: Thank you guys all for your suggestions, ideas, and search help!! I didn't find what I was expecting in any of y'all's suggestions though, to be honest. I'm starting to wonder if I just imagined this... or *maybe* it was on some other show than TAL. But I definitely thought it was TAL... or maybe one of you found the song I heard and the years have tricked my brain into thinking it was something else... who knows at this point. But I genuinely do appreciate all your thoughts and ideas. This is a great community. Cheers!I was really disappointed in the coverage. They spent almost the entire episode avoiding the acts of the gang and shifting blame for crimes they refused to list. The audience questions they chose had already been answered by the panelists. The hook was constantly "are they really that bad?" but that was only answered by 2 panelists in the same breath as downplaying it. They said it didn't affect a lot of cities but the one time they did list some of the affected cities, they mentioned some of the highest population centers like NYC, Los Angeles, Houston and DC. 

What I got from the episode was the following:

We are to blame for their actions.

They aren't big in numbers. 

We should not worry about them because they only affect Central American youth in recruiting and victimization. 

They are not organized. 

They are organized with leadership in America running things from prison and El Salvador leadership authorizing activities. 

They killed a boy with a machete and buried him in a shallow grave. 

The police need to take more action but the community can't be expected to help in investigations. 

What is the message here? Are they in fact an extremely violent gang made up largely of illegal immigrants terrorizing people in large population centers or are they just misunderstood and marginalized legal immigrants?

Is it somewhere in between and which direction does it lean towards?My French vulgarity is a little rough, but isn’t cunair the equivalent of cunt?This used to be my favorite podcasts, but the content over this last year seems to be lacking to say the least. Episodes have been way less frequent and on top of that the released ones seem like they’re mostly collaborations with, or rebroadcasts of the works of, other productions or journalists. Not to mention the episodes that are original content seem a lot shorter. This podcast coming to a standstill or something? They seem to ask for a lot of donations but that money seems to have gone to other projects like “More Perfect”. Other Podcasts linked to NPR seem like they’re churning out far more content while still retaining quality. So what’s the deal with Radiolab? Anyone else catch the interview with the mother who was irate that the shooting at the Trader Joe's in LA had scared *her child* who was not even at the scene?

I wish I could find the audio again because it was so perfectly shrill and self-concerned.It's been on for 18 months now, so any issues you have with the format/guests/topics/host at this point can't be explained by inexperience.

I REALLY miss Tom Ashbrook. I love NPR programming and programming from my local NPR station. It keeps me up to date on world events and issues that aren’t covered in mainstream media. 

Politically I’m not one way or the other really. Not a Trump supporter, but can I get 2 straight stories not about him anymore? They chase down speculative stories they normally wouldn’t, have the White House or Trump be the punchline of some stories that otherwise had nothing to do with that, etc. 

I get that America is in a scary time to many and it can’t be ignored but please try to reserve the politics just a little when it comes to non politically driven reports and stories https://i.redd.it/c1cfuzdbt5c11.png

Theres a song that sounds A LOT like the music from El Ten Eleven (not swerving ) (same guitar string plucked over and over with a pull - that i just cant seem to find - ive went through the "morning edition" lists of songs they have everyday but no luck so far - ive heard the song used for a good month now - i figured it be easier to find. Thanks!I just listened to the NPR News and am super worried about the health of news reader Shay Stevens. She stuttered, paused (very long), at times turned off a her mic for a moment, and seemed to have a bear of a time getting through the broadcast. Does anyone know if she’s ok? 

Edit: spellingEver since *Talk of the Nation* went off the air, it seems there have been multiple shows competing for midday (10 a.m.-3 p.m. weekdays) public radio listeners. Obviously *Here &amp; Now* is the NPR flagship, but *1A* and *On Point* have significant followings as well (*On Point* seems to be the closest to *TOTN* in the time slot right now).

Some stations carry more offbeat programs like *NewsHour* from the BBC, some have local programming, and some carry shows like *Fresh Air* midday. Some have more than one of these, and some have music and/or other stuff.

I've never really been able to put my finger on exactly what people want midday, and I don't think public radio in general has either. What do you think? What midday programs do you like, which ones does your station carry, and which ones don't you like?Can I be the first to ask if we can make this permanent?

Was a refreshing to have someone hosting that had a personality, the ability to actually interact with the guests, and well frankly, a pulse.....Anyone who listened to this weekend's episode of Wait Wait Don't Tell Me heard all the short jokes about Peter at the beginning. So just how short is he?I want to listen to https://www.npr.org/music/allsongs247/ on mobile. Is there anything better than just using my mobile browser? Thanks!I recently put Market Place into my podcast list. I listen at 2.5x speed. Even at that fast playback speed the music goes on for a while. Seems like a lot of unnecessary space filling. Wondering why the music goes on for so long.In 2016, NPR newscasters started adding "Live" to the beginning of each hourly newscast (every 20 mins during ME and every 30 mins during ATC).

&gt;*"Live from NPR News in Washington, I'm Dave Mattingly."*

&gt;*"Live from NPR News in Culver City, California, I'm Dwayne Brown."*

What do you think of this? I know there's been *some* backlash (as there is with any change at NPR), but as far as I know the response has been largely positive.

Personally, I love it. As an audience member, I appreciate the reassurance that my news is as up-to-the minute as possible, especially since it's so easy to tape things and broadcast them as if they were live on tape delay. As a newscaster (not on an NPR station), I think it's a really simple way of building a relationship between the newscaster and the audience. Instead of just a disembodied, far-off voice, it makes radio just a little more conversational.

Edit: formattingHas NPR tried to interview Trump? The reason I ask is I remember back in my Philly Days the local WHYY station would interview the Mayor, Michael Nutter,  on Fridays. I found these interviews incitful. I checked their site but I can’t find the transition song before all things considered in the morning, while they’re announcing a story for later. It sounds like Alt-J maybe? Really soft guitar with a cool snare beat. Any thoughts? I’ll try to record it next time I hear itNpr sounds like a bunch of butthurt journalists who've desperately been trying to claw back the 2016 election by delegitimizing Trump's election. And I understand their motivation. Trump is fucking shit up. But it's been a year and a half and there's nothing substantial coming out of the investigation. Its like screaming Benghazi over and over again hoping a scandal will materialize. Its like CNN trying to find the wreckage of flight M370. 

For leftist listeners who love to wallow in the neverending outrage of trump antics, NPR provides non-stop entertainment and stimulation. 

However I personally find little value in this type of coverage and turn more and more frequently to on-demand podcasts. I know my local affiliate npr station has been struggling and perhaps it's just been coincidence that it coincides with the trump presidency, but I'd find it highly ironic and sad if NPR's coverage of Trump were to drive me away from NPR.

I'll probably check back in 2020 but for now I think I'm going to start seeing other people.the NPR podcasts are not updating in iTunes because the security certificate is expired.  

How can I fix?*"Enemy of the people" is an incendiary phrase. It's been uttered by some of history's most vicious thugs — Robespierre, Goebbels, Lenin, Stalin, Mao — to vilify their opponents ... who were often murdered.....*

*But calling them — us — enemies of the people is the kind of curse made by tyrants."*

I fully support Scott's right to his opinion and the right of NPR to air the views of a popular host. A on-air host at NPR and other radio stations has an impact.  So my rhetorical question is when has NPR given air time to a pro Trump host? (Hint: There are no pro Trump hosts at NPR. In fact I doubt there are few if any employees in public broadcasting that are pro Trump. Balance indeed!)

[https://www.npr.org/2018/08/04/635461307/opinion-calling-the-press-the-enemy-of-the-people-is-a-menacing-move](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/04/635461307/opinion-calling-the-press-the-enemy-of-the-people-is-a-menacing-move)First off, let me just say I'm an NPR junkie. I listen every day and I have for years. The intelligent mix of balanced journalism and insightful special features are why I've been a member since I graduated college.

That being said...

I'm considering withdrawing my pledge. My complaint isn't with the news or journalism - it's with the music. My local affiliate plays daily jazz and classical music shows. Both genres I adore, by the way.

However, as someone who admittedly leans a bit left politically, I'm concerned about inclusiveness.  I worry that the divisiveness we face here in America is worsening by the day.  Stories of incels and dancing chai boys make me fearful for our nation's children. Furthermore, I fear the lack of musical diversity on NPR is one of the most under-reported causes of this crisis.  

How can both liberals and conservatives, blacks and whites, young and old, feel that competent, traditional broadcast journalism has their best interests at heart when the musical programming clearly is catering to a very thin segment of Americans?

My answer to this?  Balance. NPR desperately needs programming that doesn't just slightly variate from the current model, but falls squarely on the opposite end of the musical spectrum. Perhaps mainstream rock? America is a Big Tent with endlessly unique and diverse music and for NPR to save both its listeners and credibility before it's too late, I would humbly suggest a one hour block of afternoon programming highlighting and celebrating a few of the premier mainstream rock acts of our time.

**For example**

Five Finger Death Punch

Pop Evil

Three Days Grace

Chevelle

Korn

Limp Bizkit

These are just a few suggestions, obviously there are many more groups that would for this mold.  NPR might even consider giving airtime and much-needed exposure to a handful of nu metal bands as well - a much misunderstood and unfairly maligned genre.

Please consider the above suggestion. These are troubling times, and I cannot imagine a world on which NPR doesn't exist to continue the crucial broadcast journalism that has made it the institution it is today.

Sincerely,

A concerned American and NPR member.What do you all think?  I can't stand her voice, I find it cloying and almost pedantic.  I usually like all NPR shows but don't connect with how contrived this show seems, the topics are interesting but the way they're discussed turns me off.  Does anyone else find it reaching and overdone?  It's too much barf (for lack of a better word lol) for me.

Trying to see what the reaction to the show is in the larger NPR fanbase to see if the responses suggest taking a second look.  Thanks!I heard rumored there exists an interactive map where you can see all the coverage areas of each member station. Anyone know where this is?
I remember listening to the BBC in the late 70s, and then American National Public Radio/Public Radio International late at night. I have been a close watcher of journalism (not a professional, I admit), but it seems to me that public TV and radio in the US and the UK are some of the most objective and in-depth sources of straight-up news I can get.

Plus, they are about the best source of actually funny stuff! (Car Talk etc. which sadly ended, but I’m sure there are more.)

But people seem to love to hate on these things, and go out of their way to disparage them.

Hi, I remember hearing a show on NPR in Chicago on Sundays. It was a old man reading a old newspaper and he would comment on the prices of shirts or stories. 
I don't know what it's called but I've been searching for that shows title. 
Thanks in advance!mine was the Bone Conduction Music ShowI'm curious. If you intially signed up for the wine club last fall, are you still a member? Why or why not? What was your experience? (NPR and wine lover here. A bottle a week is pretty average for me, so I'm considering joining to support my wine habbit and public radio simultaneously.)I tried simply googling this and nothing came up. There was an AskReddit about how the outside world views the US of certain things but wondering if there is an actual subreddit dedicated to this?

What sparked this question is that there is an issue in the Philippines right now regarding a new law requiring people to have a “National ID.“ Am a US raised Filipino and having had to show my drivers license to just get a beer at the bar, I wanted to know why this would be such a viral topic there? And then I thought about Rough Translation. 

Just a thought. Would be cool to see the viewpoints of other Redditors on issues like this on one subreddit if it’s not already a thing.The other weekend there was a story told on NPR (through WBUR) about a guy and his wife getting married at either city hall or a court house. 

They talked about it being like 'a friendly DMV'. I can't seem to find it, and whenever I google 'NPR Court House Wedding' it brings up mostly same-sex marriage new programs. This was a personal story.Hi /r/npr,

As the title states, I’m looking for help finding a specific segment that discussed the White Flight from Chicago. I heard it back in 2015 as I was driving south of Madison Wisconsin. It was the first NPR segment I had ever heard and made a huge impression on me. I’d love to be a able to give it another listen and share it with others. All I can recall about it was that it was longer than a couple minute blurb and it discussed the manipulative practices of real estate agents during the White Flight.

Thanks in advance and I’ll try to be of assistance the best I can!
-SWW

Edit: I think I [found it](https://www.npr.org/2015/05/14/406699264/historian-says-dont-sanitize-how-our-government-created-the-ghettos)! It doesn’t specifically address Chicago, but it definitely has some parts later in the segment that I recall really clearly. Thanks to those who helped look!I saw an article and felt I should write to them because the article deserves some positive criticisms. It makes a good attempt but has gaping holes in the understanding of the topic. But it seems very difficult to reach. There is no way to comment or email from the article, I see social media handles of the author, but I think a longer email is a better medium, since I wouldn't like my response to be neither limited to 120 characters nor drowned by the hundreds of stupid shoutouts.

Edit: The article appeared in NPR World. I'm stuck in https://help.npr.org/customer/portal/emails/new and not sure how to cite the article and which tab is appropriate for this because NPR World does not appear there. There is one program title The World, but I think that is a different radio station perhaps? (Also, The World is not produced by NPR, it is sending me to PRI https://www.pri.org/priorg-contact)The smile in her voice after the Trump functionary said "we will see when the public sees the progress this administration has made"This is garbage news to me. Mind you, I'm 30 and I've literally been listening to NPR since I was an infant. Also mind you, my car radio typically never leaves 91.3, the local NPR station.

With that said, why is this news? Why can't they discuss far more substantive things? I never hear them defending the far more fiscally responsible universal healthcare or universal education systems.

It seems to me that NPR is becoming more and more like CNN and MSNBC. Does anyone else feel this way?I listen to Colorado public radio and on August 15 at around 2:30 in the middle of Terry Gross'  Fresh Air program there was some amazing transition music that was played. The program is here: [Fresh Air August 15th](https://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/2018/08/15/638863235), I've listened to it all again and the music wasn't in it. I tried to find the credits for the episode too but to no avail. If anyone knows where the credits for the episode are or if anyone has access to an archive of the full hour of broadcasted radio so I could just listen to that music again, it would be greatly appreciated. This weekend (Sunday morning)  my NPR station had a podcast about the subject of my post title.  I cannot find it anywhere and was wondering if someone here heard the same podcast?  In it they discussed President Truman stating in his diary that the target of the first nuclear weapon was "a purely military target" and "that no women and children would be hurt".  If someone knows the title I would really appreciate it!  


ThanksRachel Martin is a poet. It wasn't perfect by a long shot but I was pleasantly surprised by this morning's segment on DotA 2's $25 million [The International tournament](http://www.dota2.com/international/overview/). They had an actual sports correspondent go and provide context and give a sense of the feel out in the stands and on the floor of the Roger's Center. Even if he had never played the game he displayed some knowledge on the subject and treated the story with respect. This in Stark contrast to the usual gawking in disbelief that I've come to expect.

Especially after On the Media ironically fell into every single pratfall of old media covering the dang kids and their vidya games, I was bracing for impact from the word go. But they did admirably. While some of the information they presented was misleading, It's the first story I would be comfortable introducing a newcomer to the scene that doesn't come from the esports world itself.

However, the refrains from the host of "playing video games? FoR mOnEy???" were tiring. I mean they described professional gaming at the Olympics as ridiculous when we have people out here who are professional sledders. You know sledding? That thing people care about and yearly has tens of millions in tournament pay outs? But overall it was a standout piece. Keep up the good work!Personally, it already feels a lot more stable to me than the revolving door of guest hosts. Meghna definitely still gets a little excited and is cutting people off a tad much, but the conversations this week have been good overall.Sometimes I really enjoy the 10 seconds of random music that plays without acknowledgement in between sections of the program. Is there any way at all to find out what songs are featured? By the time I get Shazam on my phone to identify the music, it's already over. Help!A fellow Redditor /u/Rodd_N_Todd mentioned an interview, and I can't seem to track it down. Any insights?

&gt;NPR did an interview the other day with an ex-CIA agent (sorry couldn’t find the link), and he said Trump’s behavior right now is pretty commonly seen in Third World dictators the CIA has helped to overthrow. The term for Trump’s behavior right now is ‘bugging out’, where he gets increasingly paranoid as the walls close in around him. This agent said this is the time many of these dictators start executing their staff because they can’t figure out how sensitive information keeps getting out to the public. Trump will start lashing out at everyone around him the tighter he gets squeezed i.e. Sessions this week. Get your popcorn ready for the coming desperate squabbles he will initiate as the tides of justice move ever closer to washing over his dirty administration.

&amp;#x200B;

 I am curious to listen to this interview. Can anyone assist with the source?Friday night I heard an episode of a show (not sure what show because i don't usually listen to the radio at that time) about psychodelics and their medicinal use. Can anyone help me track this down? I wanted to send it to my friend because this topic interests him.Did anyone else hear All Things Considered yesterday about John McCain’s legacy — and notice what seemed to be Michel Martin getting very choked up as she interviewed guests? Surprised me a lot and I couldn’t 100% tell — did anyone else notice that?Note: Excuse the double fisting of "story" in the title

So it was late summer of last year, probably around the end of July around 9pm, and and I was tuned in on KQED.

It was a beautiful story about some college guy volunteering at a suicide hotline and on the other end, it was a girl talking about her beer friends and NYU(?) and towards the end they talk about ice cream.

It's been hard to disseminate exactly where the story exists, and the search results are a bit triggering, however if anyone has a link to it, I would really appreciate it.

​

​Rachel Martin's interview with Sir Kingsley ended with him reading a poem that he says Elie Wiesel (Holocaust survivor and writer) once gave to him. I haven't been able to find it anywhere else before this. It really touched a nerve.

"Let us tell tales, all the rest can wait, all the rest must wait. Let us tell tales, that is our primary obligation. Commentaries will have to come later, lest they replace or becloud what they mean to reveal. Let us tell tales, so as to remember how vulnerable man is when faced with overwhelming evil. Let us tell tales so as not to allow the executioner to have the last word -- the last word belongs to the victim. It is up to the witness to capture it, shape it, transmit it." Elie Wiesel So I am listening to the newest Freakanomics Radio episode: Why You Shouldn’t Open a Restaurant. I thought it would be like their old shows. If it were, it would likely have something about why restaurants are inherently hard to run due to economic forces, economic forces you wouldn’t expect.

However, this episode just interviewed an already-famous restauranteur. It was kind of interesting, but totally unlike the old shows.

I’ve noticed that for about 2 years now, almost every episode has been like this. There are no longer any episodes interviewing economists and psychologists asking and answering odd questions about behavior. Now they are all interviews of politicians and businessmen that are so soft they feel like ads. They even interview controversial figures like Charles Koch, without much questions of the controversy; it’s just questions almost begging the interviewee to self aggrandize. 

Has anyone else noticed this? It seems to suspiciously correlate with their sponsorship by major banks...I believe it aired in May, maybe Memorial Day. His story was stunning and the way he described the experience with the MDMA was very powerful. He said that with the MDMA he was able to revisit the memory that haunted him without feeling all of the pain. I’m not really doing the story justice, it was an incredible story. I can’t remember what show it was on. I know this is a long shot but maybe the story stayed with you like it did me. Thanks.that or with emphatic exclamation points.  Donald Trump is president. None of this should feel real. They are pointing out that the orange Russian fuckhead put himself in such a ridiculous situation, I guess.West coast is fucked if there is an emergency.Its weird that states rights applies to territories, but not Texas. It wasn’t a big deal when Hillary did the same thing.This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/09/30/554750939/france-aims-to-get-real-retouched-photos-of-models-now-require-label) reduced by 78%.

"a" high leadership position?Yeah, no big deal. Just cost her the presidency.  Hillary could have acknowledged that she screwed up and put that to bed months before it blew up in her face. 

ETA: Sexism played a role, but Clinton mismanaged her campaign left and right. Instead of downvoting me, you could tell me *why* you disagree with me...

Also, did anyone actually read the article? It's a false equivalence to compare the comment "Just Very, Very Stupid" with the ridiculous campaign against Clinton. The person who said that is the current White House Ethics Lawyer. He had nothing to do with the campaign against Clinton. You guys are falling for clickbait journalism, nothing more.Nah, she needed to be taught a lesson that america is not ready for a capable woman as president. And that a Buffon is more qualified Alienating Bernie fans, having no substantive message, shifting her politics during the campaign to better market herself, and being embroiled in a DNC scandal for the last half of the election surely played a role, too. That and she mismanaged her response, or lack thereof, to the email thing. Her inaction on the matter is one of the many reasons she snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. Sexism is another, but what about her insulting Bernie fans, even as she began to shift towards his policies like a market tester changing the flavor of their drink? What about the extremely fishy DNC scandal that she never even addressed? What about the fact that she had really no message other than  "I'm not Trump"? What about the non gendered aspects of her basic lack of appeal as a speaker? ...out of hundreds of successful ones. Stop peddling this.https://imgur.com/gallery/7tBieI am glad to hear it. Yeah. I can't disagree really. I think I'm gonna revise this and say at least five years haha. But it definitely applies to the west coast states. I find it's great he said the president of pr should be fired. 25% males fail, but 97% woman fail, just a fact that I heard on Vice News.In other words, 3 out of 4 males pass, 1 out of 30 females passed.Yep, Hillary's problem was her whole campaign strategy was to game the system. Worse, she wasn't even discreet about it. She felt like she was owed the Presidency, it was her turn, so she did everything she could to grease the wheels from the inside. It felt like the actual voters were an afterthought to her, something else she was 'owed'.It certainly came across that way all too often.Really really really awful. I feel sick. Prayers to all the families.positioned above the crowd, shooting down as they attended an outdoor concert.  ppl didnt know where the fuck the bullets were even coming from, initially.  goddammit.

TIL!Jesus, I saw the beginnings of this story on the news last night. But... fifty people? That's horrifying... It was some random white guy. Pulse was only just over a year ago. Words can't even.The guy in the hotel was doing it.And isis claims credit. Wait and see.Does ISIS claim credit for stuff they didn't do a lot? I wasn't aware that was part of their MO.Nah usually theyre pretty straight up, and they usually provide evidence to prove it. Give it time, wait for the "motives unclear" smoke to pass, in a week or so we will have a better idea.Funny how this comment is getting downvoted. I think the exact same thing when there's a mass murder, as conservative media uses any excuse they can to sow the seeds of hatred and fear. Fox News would have a field day if this guy was black, a Mexican immigrant, or a Muslim.What the fuck.It just seems very unlikely to me that the young lad marde this remark organically.

How is he getting tweets when Puerto Rico is almost entirely without electricity right now, his sister just told us that it took her nine days to find a working phone to call her dad, and how much she misses being able to use social media?

Even if he could get the tweets. Every other quote in the article is tied directly into the conversation, so why did that one have to be tossed at the very end of the article?

Oh my gosh! An oh so important person from the White House! Stop sending tweets and come help the people!

It's at least kind of fishy, right?

I get the sentiment, but I think a better train of thought might be hoping that it's not political. I wish they would stop playing recordings of the gunshots. If we want to hear it, we can search on YouTube or less reputable news sources.Yeah Rachel Martin was obviously shaken up having to listen to that. After a couple seconds she told the producer to turn it off. I've heard it twice already on WBEZ. Not sure if they're replaying the same audio, but we've heard enough.Which means you hope it's not a POC but some white guy implicitly?

What the fuck is wrong with you? **This is an act of pure evil.** This transcends race, politics or religion. I feel pretty sick about this honestly. Even the NPR correspondents aren't going to wish this guy had a certain skin color. Rethink what you just said.I wish I could say im shocked. Just par for the course these days. Thanks MericaNo, I don't believe NPR would have their reporters waste their time and talents on "manufactured clickbait" articles. 

The kid has family in the states following the coverage and 95% of his island is without power and needing assistance. 

He wouldn't have to be speaking in anything more than generalities to assume that Trump is probably off tweeting about nonsense, let alone know that he was attacking the Mayor of San Juan. I guess I just don't freak out like you do when something bad happens. That and I don't like to see vulnerable groups get exploited by conservative media. Just like OPs Title.So an 8 year old whos family has zero access to any form of telecommunication happened to hear about the tweets less than a day after they were made or reported on, then coincidentally, knock knock knock, "hi this is npr?"

That's more logical than NPR stooping to a new low? 
Beep boop. I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They did have land lines and spoke to family in the US, but that's also why I mentioned the generalities. 

It doesn't take an 8 year old Puerto Rican boy to see that Trump would probably get a lot more accomplished if he stopped saying dumb shit and picking fights on twitter. 

I'd be willing to bet that "stop sending tweets and come help the people" has been said in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico a lot of times in the last month... You're misrepresenting my claim here.  I'm not disputing whether Trump went overboard with his Tweetstorm on Cruz or whether an 8 year old would be able to draw that conclusion independently.

I'm asking whether an 8 year old with no access to the internet, a television, or radio(?) made such a quintessential remark organically? Or was it "manufactured."  How much effort did the reporter need to put in to get those words out of his mouth? Was she just having a casual discussion?

Its funny you mention how much Trump is getting done because the 20 year old sister in this story was willing to criticize the media's apparently exaggerated coverage of Puerto Rico, but oddly had nothing to say about trump or his tweets, or the [remarks by the mayor that that](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/09/29/san-juan-mayor-slams-trump-administration-comments-on-puerto-rico-hurricane-response/?utm_term=.832057ccb2f0) provoked them. i think its really cute that an 8 year old insulted Trump too, but I would have liked to hear an adult's interpretation of what's transpiring somewhere along with that. You know? The real story. They always claim credit, I would bet more on the shooter being a right wing nut job than an having any connection with ISIS. They arent known for lying about such things. Regardless, hes more likely to have been radicalized by cnn than by "the right". Especially considering the target.ISIS repeatedly claims credit for attacks they had no part of. The Orlando shooting, the Nice attack, the shooting at a Manila casino in June; none of them had anything to do with ISIS yet they claimed responsibility for them all. At best, you could argue that they inspired these attacks, but I find it highly unlikely that ISIS was in direct contact with a well off, 64 old man living in Mesquite, NV.Had to Google it..

Ramona's owner has a very extensive vocabulary Yes, of course it's a senseless act of pure evil. I feel for the victims and their families. I saw the clip, and it shook me to my core. Your comment just shows me you are person of privilege, someone who thinks racism doesn't exist. Don't you think if the shooter "looked Muslim" the story would be immediately spun a certain way? Even if he had nothing to do with ISIS, that would be the immediate reaction. People would see that and it would only affirm their biased  beliefs. And it goes beyond liberal or conservative news outlets because both sides do itI've never met a person with the name Ira, and yet NPR has like 6 of them.I really hope Ramona is a bear cub and it's not the usual NPR snake story.

Looks [manufactured](https://www.reddit.com/r/NPR/comments/73ue8s/does_this_article_strike_anyone_else_as)  Ramona got 100 upvotes in an hour yesterday. What happened today? :(is there any other kind of exclamation point?As you're probably aware, Morning Edition is a two-hour show that many stations play twice (or more). In a changing news environment like yesterday, it was live all morning. What likely happened yesterday was the repeated/recorded hour started playing erroneously while they were also opening that hour of the show live.They *should* add the bumper music used on [this page](http://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered/2017/10/02/554993849?showDate=2017-10-02) very soon. Sunday's program has it, it might take a day or two. With the fluidity and breaking news of yesterday, it's possibly they might not add it in case it was different from hour to hour. It's a two hour program that's updated in case of breaking news, like yesterday.We need more stuff like this. Who knows, with time, NPR may end up inadvertently covering the Russia story!Need more information than that. what's the episode about for starters? Ira Kaplan from the band Yo La Tengo is another great Ira!You can hear all the same stories by googling, "All Spooked".
Alot of Spooked stories are the same from All Spooked. Pretty lame that that's what they did.I don't remember for sure, but it might be about songwriting?As someone who lived in Tempe for 7 years was gonna say, ASU school of engineering anyone?This American Life, episode 600, Will I Know Anyone at This Party?Someone convinced us she was manufactured clickbait.

How did a one-year old with no access to the internet commandeer the NPR twitter account? You think that spasmatic joy is organic? Wake up sheeple.When our story continues Three cat actsOh pish posh, Ramona obviously has ample access to the internet and is a prodigious hacker. Quit it with the crazy conspiracy theories ya crazy nut.I haven't listened all day, but they have had stories on the victims.  They interviewed relatives of victims.Yes. I find it rather sad that the most important thing to newscasters is the name of the shooter, thereby heightening his notoriety when it's proven that such behavior inspires copycats.That's my kid. And my spouse...I'm not an expert on exclamation points, so can't really tell you definitively, but I'll say yes.  Multiple exclamation points add to the emphatic levels.  Buy they're all emphatic...but there are *levels*They did a 5 minute piece with someone who was there early this morning. It was pretty good.
I dunno, I don't know what the right way to handle this stuff is.
I do think it's natural to want to understand this person.
But like many of these shootings and other mass killings, there is often nothing of substance to be learned.you nailed it. I think people innately want a justification for why something so absurd happened. But in searching for justification we just end up glorifying them as societies antiheroes.

And i also dont know what the right way to handle this stuffWe are trying to find meaning behind this tragedy. Right now it's a complete mystery why he did this; there is no obvious reason and that is terrifying. A random act of violence with no other meaning than to create suffering threatens our sense of safety and faith in the system. By analyzing his life we seek to find meaning and closure. If we can find a reason behind the violence, why someone would do this, it not only allows us to prepare and prevent events like this from happening again but helps restore our faith that there is order and justice to the universe.

In any case, the people who are are likely to be inspired will be drawn by the acts of violence themselves rather than the individual committing it. I remember many terrorist attacks and the motive behind them, but almost none of the names of those who carried them out. It's possible that by heavily focusing on these acts themselves we are only giving it more prestige. An egomaniac killer craves attention, they are unable to attain it within the bounds of society so they turn to inappropriate and horrifing actions. The more attention their act draws the greater their satisfaction and success.

Perhaps the best way to dissuade copycats is to give their actions as little attention as possible. By focusing on the perpetrator we change the conversation from what they did to who they were. Maybe we should bring back public humiliation as punishment for glory killers. Go full on paparazzi, dig up every shameful little secret the attacker tried to hide and drag their name's through the mud right up to the edge of libel. Make it clear to any would be domestic terrorist that their lives will be dissected and ridiculed while their act of violence becomes more and more an afterthought. Ensure that they will not get the attention they seek, only scorn and pity.I feel like there is nothing of substance, only more accounts of how sad it is. The last two days my local radio choices have been nothing but "LAS VEGAS IS HORRIBLE!" and "Let's hear Tom Petty again!" I'm really burnt out, even the "helpful Honda guys" feels like a nice break in the depressing monotony Hidden brain: http://www.npr.org/2015/11/10/454589085/the-best-laid-backup-plansI understand the reason for doing a piece on the perpetrator. I get why one would say the name once. But the last newscast I heard a few hours ago mentioned his full name, first and last, four times in the span of one minute. four times. that's adulation. that's not analyzing his life. his name does not provide a reason behind the violence and it does not help preventing this from happening again. if those were your reasons for saying his name over and over again then you missed the mark. I agree that your example goes beyond what I would consider good taste and boarders on clickbait. However, due to how little we know about the suspect speading his name out there might be actually helpful. By getting his name out there people who have previous met and/or known him will be made aware of this come forward with possible information. 1A had a bit where they talked about how we shouldn't give the shooter attention or make them famous posthumously and then... they did. mehThey should focus on gun control. Stories from countries where guns have been "recently" banned, news of gun control legislation vs the NRA. They should be trying to answer the question, "why is the US so obsessed with guns?"I havent been psyched with npr for a while, but found this to be interesting, informative, well explained, and different from what feels like the same 10 topics they cover.GREAT NEWS! I MISS HIM SOOO MUCH!

bye, bye.Welcome to American mediaThey still haven't done it. In addition to the online stream being off for the last full day (at least) I'm starting to really wonder what the hell is going on.If he wasn't white, would you be asking the same question?Which stream are you trying to access?Exactly right.I was going to say the opposite. I only listen on the radio on the way to work. They've been doing little pieces about each one of the victims. They have been very respectful to the people they have been interviewing. Asking if the person is okay vs other news organizations hoping to get a great sound bite. Yeah, I think almost every cable news channel has that angle covered pretty heavily.

Besides, there's a bit of recognition that gun control would've had to go pretty far to prevent this. I'm pretty sure those bump fire devices are going to get banned, but they were a loophole anyway. When I listen to Morning Edition and All Things Considered, there's been numerous stories about the victims.

That being said, since there is such a giant question mark as to why this guy did what he did, coverage exploring that issue is important.No, although the Paul Ryan wussy song is brilliant!Oh. My. Gosh. No, not that one, it's the other one with the same songwriter: 

http://www.npr.org/2015/09/22/434597124/trying-to-change-or-changing-the-subject-how-feedback-gets-derailed

Thank you SO MUCH! No wonder I couldn't find it when I wasn't even looking at the right show! Apparently my brain keeps things hidden from me!!I really wonder what the hell happened. I could understand some malfunction taking a few minutes or even a few hours off, but this was *days*..I think you might be surprised how not unpopular that opinion is, particularly with the younger-skewed demographic on reddit.I'd love to see a roundup of what various stations put in. It's essentially "prime time" when it comes to public radio stations, so I'm curious what various station managers and programming directors choose to  highlight.Ours was also Planet Money/How I Built This. I didn't think to check until near the end of the hour, and I didn't realize How I Built This was only a half-hour show. I don't think KUHF aired car talk on Sundays.One of the things that started getting to me in the last year or so is how out of date so much of the car advice is getting. There are not a lot of people still driving 90's anythings.Agreed. That's very strange.Good heavens. What station is that? That sounds great, I'll have to check it out. 
I was hoping this would be an opportunity to discover some new programming.Ah, well, I think there might be some confounding influences there ;)I'm really very fond of dinner party download, but as mentioned elsewhere in the thread, it's not a great fit for saturday morning programming.Wasn't Wits! Minnesota Public Radio production? I loved that show. it felt much more the spiritual successor to PHC. Because this has no particular link to NPR or public radio, I'm removing this post.This feels familiar, but I'm not turning up anything with a CDC physician, specifically. Can you help narrow down the search? 
Was it Morning/Daytime/Evening or Weekday/Weekend? Ok, [this is the one ](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/08/10/542605039/a-vaccine-for-addiction-is-no-simple-fix)I was remembering, with Dr. Montoya from The NIDA. And that was the 10th. 
The editing isn't anywhere near as surreal as Radiolab's. It's more like Supreme Court meets Those Few RadioLab Segments That Make It To This American Life No, he meant the Christian God literally. Trump can't even string two coherent sentences together and you think he's using metaphorical language?  
   
  
From the article:  
 
"We are stopping cold the attacks on Judeo-Christian values," Trump said to applause.*nerd puns*That or maybe early onset dementia.Sorry I meant the early stages of it. It's certainly a concern for a man his age.Actually, you might enjoy tuning in to TPHC. The last year with Chris Thiele has changed the formula with less scripted regular segments and more music and stand up comedians. There's also a musicians birthdays segment that shows off their talents. And yet it's still very much the soul of America. Wharton. But taking—for example—the aftermath of the financial crisis, I don't think "accountability" is really top-of-line curriculum for any business schools.NPR Sucks!If I found out my station was donating *to* Koch industries, I would certainly re-think my pledge.Curious. Trying to post gives you [this message](https://imgur.com/q05koop).
&gt;We removed this story because it looks like spam and doesn't follow our community standards.

 Several other people are mentioning it on FB. You seem to be able to post the story from local affiliates, but not NPR's own site?&gt;To myself ^and ^that ^motorcycle ^guide ^I ^slipped ^€50 !This seems like the most appropriate thread to ask (and even then, it's a stretch). I've asked my wife to play the incidental cello bump from NPR — Morning edition? I think? — it's literally just three notes. But she's asked me to find it for her so she can mimic it. Me going "bu-bu-bum!" doesn't seem to cut it. 

So do you have any clue where I could hear that? Do you know what I'm talking about?24 days later. what information have we learned about the motives that we could use to enact policy to prevent such shootings from happening again? 

We blasted his face and life on TV and yet we got nothing.I agree with you completely. I've been listening to the NPR Politics podcast for years. I've always noticed a leftward lean, but since the election, there's been a distinct change.

I understand that the President is far from ideal, and it bothers me greatly. That said, an inadequate president should be met with factual, accurate, thorough reporting that shows why he/she may be in the wrong. 

The snark, the assumption that their point is the *correct* point, the sarcasm--it all detracts from the potency of good reporting. I'm not tuning in for The Daily Show, I'm tuning in for a public radio broadcast on the current political events. 

There's always room for personality in a host, I'm not asking for something unbelievably dry, but they absolutely need to dial it back from where it currently is. I find myself turning the show off quickly.

(As an example, in their latest "Weekly Roundup," 50% was spent speculating negatively about the upcoming budget proposal with no clear information yet, 40% was spent talking about how, despite declaring the heroin epidemic a "national emergency," that it was the wrong *kind* of classification, 9% *giggling and mocking* Steve Bannon's previous entertainment career, and then 1% was spent explaining that, this past week, a lot of potentially unfavorable Clinton-Russia information had surfaced, and that they *would not be talking about it, and will touch on it next week.* It's reporting like that that makes it feel *extremely* one-sided, and the snark takes it over the top. Apologies for the length here; I just finished the podcast and was very frustrated with it.)Or on some stations, between Prairie Home and Prairie HomeMy old CEO is a middle-aged woman who raises goats.I really appreciate how open NPR has been about this story, on air and online.[NYT also reported it.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/business/media/mike-oreskes-npr-sexual-harassment.html)It's around five now.Some of these stories aren't even sexual harassment

"Hey, you doing anything tonight? I'm free all night"


If I ask a lady one time if she wants to fuck...does that make me a sexual harasser? 

Jesus, you guys are way way wayyyy overboardThat part would be sexual assault. 

Asking a bitch if she wants to go out one time isn't harassment
 That's what half the story was about. They said he hit on multiple women at the workplace and would hit up women online... They had to have a meeting about it. 

In Germany, you can fuck anyone. I don't understand how the employer sees fit to put itself into my sexual life...oh well. 


Wanna come over?Perez is part of the problem. He is as big of a question-avoider as Brazile and Clinton are.

I'm glad some people are noticing this stuff, but I have a feeling it will take a little longer for the broader culture to really stand up against this kind of B.S. I don't trust the DNC anymore, and Perez has cemented it.

The DNC operates on political cronyism. There are bright progressive minds and voices that aren't being tapped into because they threaten the "establishment." Big changes would need to happen quickly to restore my faith.

**Edit:** Nina Turner killed it though.Not working for me unfortunately :( that's exactly the kind of link I'm looking for though. Yes! Thank you so much!You can play it through winamp, but you can't save the URL as an offline link. So you basically have to click that link through a webpage every time you want to listen.  
  
The other link below is great because you can save it as its own file, and add it to a playlist on winamp. 
  
For me I have a few radio stations I enjoy including NPR &amp; C-SPAN on my winamp playlist so I can easily "tune" through radio stations on my computer. I've managed to find the .pls file which anyone can use here:   
  
www.npr.org\/streams\/aac\/live1_aac.pls 
 
 it can't be prefixed with HTML, fyi. 
  
You can save that link as a file on your computer and save it to a playlist on your media player (I use winamp) to easily cycle through stations.

 Similarly I've found the [.mp3 file for the C-SPAN streaming radio](https://playerservices.streamtheworld.com/api/livestream-redirect/CSPANRADIO.mp3) off of their website, but I can't find the .pls or non-HTML version of that link to effectively download and add to my folders on my drive. If anyone can figure that out, that would be fuckin daaaank.Have there ever been studies of how NPR's coverage of pharma/labor issues changed pre and post getting those big donos? I don't know of a time before corporate underwriters (though a foundation is different than a corporation).Has he resigned?  I can't find a source for that anywhere.So... no actually confirmation still?  You're just speculating about what might happen after a possible event that has not yet occurred.I love [The Unbelievable Truth](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007mf4f) and  [Just A Minute] (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006s5dp/episodes/player).Yeah, may as well say that Sadie Atkins committed misconduct with Sharon TateAs for whether the machines are coming for us:

"No," Stephen said. "Not anytime SOON.” 😈As a fellow Houstonian, I take mild offense at Chicago assuming the mantle of "Third Coast"Ugh get a grip. No, the average native american doesn't care about any of this shit. Neither does anyone else that doesn't sit around all day and complain for a living. NPR giving trash like this a platform is why they have lost substantial credibility over the yearsNo culture sees Thanksgiving as a day of mourning. Only a millennial part of the paid victim generation. Difference between caring and this garbage NPR diatribe&gt;In 2011, an O'Keefe sting led to the ouster of NPR's CEO and its top fundraiser. The network acted before analyses showed O'Keefe's tapes had been deceptively edited. This week, The Washington Post exposed O'Keefe's attempted sting in real time - all project and no Veritas. David Folkenflik, NPR News.

Ha, that was business and personal (and beautifully delivered)aka, NPR publishes unused story-lines from *The Wire* season 4.It has been a substantially *different show* with Thile (I still think WITS was a closer "spiritual successor" to PHC) so the name change doesn't much trouble me any, but "Town Hall" in particular a seems much more appropriate for a Talk of The Nation type issues based, call in programme. All the more reason we should come up with a list of suggestions!And even if it weren't, this sub is happy to "showcase really good radio stories — and the people who make them." 

NPR is a handy moniker for listener-supported radio in the United States, but we're just as open to content and discussion of APM (Prairie Home Companion &amp; Marketplace), PRI (The World), Pacifica, This American Life, etc... I also think that fertility is an emotional issue that many people feel desperate about. And any new practice that strips large amounts of money from desperate, emotional people might set off ethics alarm bells in some people's heads. 

But that feels like a little bit of a reach for an "angle" on an otherwise *Gee Wizz, Science!* story.I really think that live, right after this there was a one line explanation, but I don't remember exactly what it said. Like after the musical interlude Greene said something like 'We think this is what he's talking about:' but that's about it.  Because I do remember thinking it was odd yesterday.Get Sirius, you won't regret it.So you're saying it airs 1A...There's not one that I know of, but we could probably sort it out here. Which ones do you know of? This feels like /r/nightvale material.They were told to.Do you remember when the dog kennel on the car roof was a legit campaign concern?*Spoilers!*I've somewhat replaced NPR with Joe Rogan podcast but I'd like something to listen to that is more along the lines of news. I honestly hate all 3 of those topics, they're so overdone. Some background,

* https://www.npr.org/2017/11/15/564272323/russia-to-require-foreign-media-to-register-as-foreign-agentsI thought the Blow Dry Bar last week was pretty interesting. In fact, I think every one of those I've heard has been interesting. Spanks, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Melissa and Doug...

I think I'd like to hear from someone with physical a product who had to wrangle with manufacturing. Gosh it must be tempting to save up for it an really let one sing. I wonder if in NPR's budget there is a line-item for "2018 Cuss Word"I heard it on my way home from work this morning and was amazed that a curse word was being used. But it is being done in context to what Trump said so I don't have a problem with it in the slightest&gt; I give a lot of credit to NPR for being honest and frank in the way they tell a story.

More like biased and deceitful.Their entire programming is catered to a liberal worldview. 

They pretend they are neutral by simply not saying, "Vote Democrat"

I call them deceitful because they accept federal funding on the premise that they aren't a propaganda network, when they are - and they know they are.
The "[updated guidance](https://twitter.com/NPRmelissablock/status/951817409987563520)" from some professional sitting at a computer thinking "I really, did not think I would ever have to write this."I see your Code Switch, and raise you Goats &amp; Soda: "[Is It Insulting To Call This A 'Hut'?](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/11/12/563305753/is-it-insulting-to-call-this-a-hut)" 

(not trying to counter the point, but I thought this was a really interesting discussion in November)&gt; Working for an affiliate station, I can tell you that NPR, more than any other news outlet, works very hard to be as objective as possible in their reporting

Maybe its the station I listen to, but it completely and utterly runs stories and investigative reporting into liberal causes.

For example - I've heard literally 100 sob stories about upstanding *undocumented* (LOL) immigrants that aren't getting a fair shake because of our immigration laws. Its a new portrait each time, but each report is exactly what liberals want to hear to reinforce their position on immigration.

I've never heard any indepth story regarding American citizens murdered by illegal aliens, illegal aliens depressing American wages, illegal aliens in gangs, illegal aliens milking our welfare system or illegal aliens and drug trafficking - a big fat ZERO.

I have a hard time respecting liberals that can't accept the bias.

&gt;For as many complaints we get about being too liberal, we get about being too conservative.

When your listening base is 90% liberal, it is going to be a battle between moderate liberals and extreme liberals. The key takeaway is NPR's worldview excludes 50% of the population.Look another indepth NPR report showing the horrors of conservative immigration policy.

I'm sure the next one will cover the anguish of families who had loved ones murdered by illegals.&gt;Just because you don't hear them doesn't mean they don't exist. I turned these up with about a 5 second google search:

What doesn't exist? You didn't link to anything that showcased a in-depth report showcasing a conservative point of you. Those articles you posted are news articles for the most part and the first when spent the entire second half trying to discredit Trump's policies.

I find it amazing that you cannot even understand your own liberal worldview and put it into context.

I spend a significant amount of time understanding your side, which is why I am able to point out bias when I see it.

Why are liberals so insistent that their precious NPR is not biased, when it is *beloved* by liberals and mainly shunned by conservatives? Do you honestly not have the intellectual honesty to recognize that it caters to you?

&gt;You may not hear many of those stories you're talking about because NPR is not Infowars. Their journalistic standard is higher than the memes you see on Facebook. So yes, they do stories on undocumented immigrants from their perspective, because we know the lawmakers perspective. 

I must have hit a nerve. NPR can have journalistic standards, but still run stories that propagate a liberal worldview. Why is that so hard to understand?

&gt;So yes, they do stories on undocumented immigrants from their perspective, because we know the lawmakers perspective.

What does that even mean? "Lawmakers" perspective? Is that Democrat lawmakers that routinely claim things like illegals "embody the best of our nation" (Pelosi)

Your attempt at justifying your bias doesn't really help you case that NPR isn't biased. Just own it.

&gt;And, I can assure you as the employee of a member station with much NPR programming, we have a pretty balanced political listener base. Lots of conservatives and liberals are listeners and members.

I am a conservative listener and I'm definitely in the minority.

http://www.journalism.org/interactives/media-polarization/outlet/npr/

I also listen to understand and conceptualize the liberal worldview. NPR is excellent at it.&gt;Why would NPR cover something that occurs infrequently?

Approximately 27% of federal inmates are illegal aliens.

https://www.gao.gov/assets/100/93090.pdf

&gt; The average American citizen is more likely to be murdered by their fellow citizens.

Tell that to the family's of victims of illegal crime. A crime that shouldn't have occurred because they shouldn't be in our country.

Here if you are interested in real people and stories (why doesn't NPR pick one of these tragedies to report on? hmmm):

https://fairus.org/issue/illegal-immigration/examples-serious-crimes-illegal-aliens

&gt;https://www.cato.org/blog/immigration-crime-what-research-says

Why are you linking something that combines illegal and *legal* immigration? I only referenced illegal immigration. That study is flawed, here, learn some more:

https://www.heritage.org/immigration/commentary/crimes-illegal-aliens-not-legal-immigrants-are-the-real-problem

&gt;I doubt you actually care about facts and statistical analysis.

Maybe its time to step outside the NPR echo chamber. NPR won't give you the other sides data, we've already established that.&gt; Fairus.org also known as the Federation for American Immigration Reform is listed as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

SPLC has zero credibility.

But regardless of your obvious dodge, can you not comment on all those victims? Are they not worthy of an NPR special? I wonder why.

&gt; Additionally 7.3% of all inmates are there for immigration offences, meaning that the real number is 13.2% for all other crimes. That is a big difference

That doesn't mean they aren't there for other offenses too. 

Regardless, you are talking a population that is roughly 4 percent of our population being represented 12 percent in federal prison.

I guess that just isn't a big enough deal for NPR to really care about.

They do care about food truck workers fearing deportation though - thats *tragic*!
I think it's called "Live From Here" now. I saw it when perusing my stations schedule the other day and also noticing the reruns had been dropped from the Sunday lineup in favor of rerunning programs from SaturdayFulltext of the newsblurb they take issue with: 
&gt;Former congressman, Cleveland Mayor and Fox talk show regular Dennis Kucinich is the latest to throw his hat into the ring for Ohio governor. Kucinich came to the Ohio Statehouse, also known as the People’s House, to announce his candidacy.

&gt;[Kucinich] “I’m running for Governor of Ohio to make state government subject to the power of we the people.”

&gt;Kucinich promised a lot, including a higher minimum wage, reformed education funding, high-speed rail, universal access to health care and public broadband services. When asked how those would be paid for, he said it was a matter of reallocating resources. 

&gt;Jo Ingles at the Ohio Public Radio Statehouse News Bureau 

Then they make fun of the sound of her voice for a while. 

I mean, there's clearly shitting on being done in the video, but it seems like NPR is on the receiving end.I was thinking through this, and I think that would indicate that 100% of what they were considering would be things, rather than the inverse(converse?) that 100% of things would be considered.ITT: Everyone loves reposts!I agree with the idea that they're discussing it ad nauseum, but the "if he'd lost we wouldn't be discussing it" seems like a silly way to say that. Of course it's being discussed a lot because he won. We also hear less about Hilary's scandals because she lost. And if Hilary had won, we'd hear more about her and less about Trump. It seems like a "duh" statement.I was really hoping he'd get Rehm's slot in the first place. I always enjoyed the times he'd fill in for her, and it's miles away from Johnson's show. I need to find some system that will notify me ahead of time when there's going to be a guest host for 1A.That's interesting. I agree the investigation would be much further along, but I think the 24 hour news cycle/talk shows would cover it less frequently. I think they'd be busy covering Clinton's decisions/possible gaffs. 

The professor seemed to think this was just a way to distract from Trump's good performance. I think that if Russia had a hand in getting this buffoon elected, everyone wants to know ASAP. That's true! I'm no fan of Trump, but it did seem obvious the interviewer was looking for bad things to say. 

In regards to the stock market topic- I think this is another warped perspective from his position.

His logic checks out, of course, but this has *always* been the case. When a sitting president has something good happen, his base supports him and his detractors look for who's actually responsible. If the stock market got worse, his supporters would be bashing Obama and his detractors would be talking about Trump's bad policy.

Regardless, Trump would never get praise from this from the majority of the country- because he lost the popular vote and has a lower approval rating. This amplifies the above effect. 

The professor's gripe that he should be getting praise for something he didn't do in conjunction with his flawed perspective just made me sigh.I was hoping for this kind of deeper analysis from the segment. Glad I got some better replies here.Well, I'm not a fan of faux impartiality. But, they're the best radio station I can get out in the sticks in Alabama. Wow just found this sub, I’m in fucking heaven No they did it in all things considered or in the 5 minutes news segment yesterday I normally have NPR on for jazz and classical music, but I like the talk segments usually. What's that?:/ I've got limited high speed data, sadly. I think most people feel that way. The professor seemed a bit dense.

That's is a cool radio station name, by the way. Guessing they don't use it for humor, sadly.Idk, look at a twitter post of nor’easterAnd I think your talking about Mary Louise kelly who took over his spotThe Washington thing is indeed ok, and so subtle that I never noticed until reading that critique. The other blunders are the type that led me to believe it was an intern/inexperienced reader in the beginning. That RSS feed only has the last episode, and it’s not her. I’ll reply again the next time I catch one.I agree her voice is excellent ... but was under the impression that an amazing radio voice was only one of at least two requirements for professional news readers.

I’m blown away that you’ve never noticed, during the past weeks it’s been happening almost every time she reads. Next time it happens I’ll reply again (the feed seems to only have the previous episode (which makes sense for a news summary)Ok that didn’t take long ... looked on the website and found one from 4am today 

https://www.npr.org/podcasts/500005/npr-news-now

I can’t figure out how to link directly to the file (it’s “NPR News: 02-02-2018 4AM ET”). At 2m17s she says “*petroleuN* industry”

Seriously I could find you many many more examples, this was simply the first one in most recent podcast.

Edit: 3m15s same episode she stumbles/pauses before incorrectly pronouncing “negligent”  

Edit: 3am broadcast was clean... in NPR News: 02-02-2018 2AM ET at 1m40s she says “rod cross” instead of Red Cross ... I find it very hard to believe nobody notices this stuff, we aren’t taking about difficult foreign names, rather the word “red”
Found one on the website within 3 minutes ... copypasta below from another response

Edit: 3am broadcast was clean... in NPR News: 02-02-2018 2AM ET at 1m40s she says “rod cross” instead of Red Cross ... Honestly no ... I’m convinced these flubs are like nails on a chalkboard to all her colleagues and bosses, and that she has some special protection inside the organization that led to graveyard shift. Sending a mail or tweet would come off as aggressive or simply being a blowhard, and be discarded and forgotten. Was thinking that doing it this way would come across as much more reasonable should anyone of influence come across the thread at any time in the future. I searched Reddit for her name and found nothing ... the next person who does the same will find this thread!Ok, now I feel like a crazy person--

I just listened to it on [Wait Wait's site](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/344098539/wait-wait-don-t-tell-me) and at 30:12, it defintiely plays something else that's not [Coldplay "Yellow"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKNxeF4KMsY)... it's something else, and way more sing-song-yhmm, will check this when I get home and can play it on a desktop. It was the podcast version when I was first listening to it (was trying to figure out if maybe Alexa could 'name that tune'), but the Wait Wait site seems to have the same thing.Google tells me it's "Good Morning Sunshine" by Ron Kristy on the album [Simple is Good](https://play.google.com/music/preview/Ajjqu4t5xiy26ebyzwtkwynvjha?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=buylink&amp;u=0#) from 2014.YOU ARE MY HERO! It doesn't look like the lyrics are listed on any sites - explains why my search based on exact text went nowhere! Thank you!!/u/PhillipBrandon found it above! and thanks for the blog post!I don't mind her.  Personally I think her voice makes her a perfect fit for the graveyard shift when comparing her to Jack Speer or Corva Colman.  That being said, there's always room for improvement.

What are the hours she does the updates?  I've heard her as early as 11pm and as late as 4am, so I'm assuming she does like 10am through 4am and then someone takes over for ME?Current hosts are Ari Shapiro and Mary-Louise Kelley. Audi Cornish is still there too but I almost never hear her anymore for some reason.  Elsa Chang helps out quite often too.

So they technically still need a 4th host.  I vote they pull Guy Raz off the TED Radio Hour and then give that program to me ;) Jk that's a pipe dream that'll never happen unless I get extremely lucky someday soon here. I think it fits better at that time than the 1800-1900 slot that the community radio station I volunteer for airs it in.  As It Happens needs to be a slot where it can cater to the people who want to hear it, and in my mind, 11/10c is perfect! As It Happens is easily one of my favorite public radio programs.  That being said, it would be nice if both Off and Douglas could go at least one full month without taking a day or five off.  It seemed that all throughout last year, every other time I tuned in one or both of the hosts were absent, more often Off than Douglas. Right.  I take it you're an MPR listener?  I listen to it when I'm near where I'm live, but listen to the station I volunteer for when I'm up in that area or at home.  What do you think of the channel?  Sometimes I think it's a little too automated, but at the same time I think of it as "NPR Cable" because there's less talking and only 2 or 3 locally produced programs versus my station, which is about 75% in house produced. Audi Cornish is still a host? I don’t hear her anymoreThat's the station I volunteer for :D I'd rather not reveal my name on here though.  We've got some great stuff going on all the time!  Who are your favorite volunteers to listen to?  Mine are Mike Spry, DJ Dang, Curt Randa, Shannon Fitch, Charlie Rockler, Bill Tucker, and Val Satterstrom :) 

And I agree.  Or like that guy who took over for Tom Weber on the 1-hour MPR News Show that airs at 10 or 11.  He just sounds so bored I can't stand him. I think his name is Mike....?She shows up every so often now, but I'm kinda surprised she hasn't left the program yet.  There could be something going on we don't know about though... If she does leave, I think they should give the spot to Corva Coleman or Jack Speer as a promotion from reading the headlines and bring in another person to do the graveyard shift while moving Shay Stevens to the daytime and pulling a person from the weekend to fill the other vacancy. Yea jack Speer is pretty good too No pun intended.Does it air outside of the weekend?  I usually see new episodes drop at Midnight ET on Friday on NPR One and the show's website, but then they air over the weekend on stations.  Many weeks I've noticed the same show pop up on the NPR One App, as I listen to it both ways depending on which way I catch it first.  

In all honesty, I'd be pretty surprised if a show like this one was having problems getting it's episodes cleared for broadcast, but then again I could be wrong. Re-runs seem to have been coming steadily (2 or 3 weeks a month), since late September, so it seems like the time for re-run heavy weeks would be past at this point.  I know it was new the last two weeks, so we'll see what happens this week :) Thanks so much! And awesome, I'm technically from Texas but have loved my time in college in Arkansas. Nice to meet you, thanks for watchingThat's awesome, nice to meet you. And thanks for watchingthanks so much. KUAF is a cool place with awesome people glad you enjoy it and the videoHer voice is top-shelf. Perfect nighttime radio voice. 

Today there seemed to be fewer blunders, but many more long pauses that broke the flow. It sounds like she’s reading from a teleprompter that’s lagging. 

I think she’s on from 11PM to 4AM, I’m usually listening to the 1, 2, and 3AM during the morning here (7, 8 and 9AM in GMT+1). When she’s on shift, she’s the only host/reader I hear. This is probably why the blunders are more egregious to me than to others who hear her less frequently, extolling the voice itself, and overlooking/forgiving the blunders.

This bot is almost always hitting false positives. You need to train it better, right now we have it flagged as nuisance and spam foldered.&gt;"[The Psychological Forces Behind A Cultural Reckoning: Understanding #MeToo](https://www.npr.org/2018/02/05/582698111/the-psychological-forces-behind-a-cultural-reckoning-understanding-metoo)"

in case clickbait isn't your thing.This article says it was limited to one season and she’ll do another different podcast this year

http://www.newhampshire.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20180125/NEWHAMPSHIRE01/180129634/-1/mobile_newhampshireThis isn't a dis on NPR donors, btw, it's really an analysis of why I listen to so much NPR.  However, it also, a slight dis at the reason people give for donating to NPR.  As much as I agree with giving people a fair and balanced platform for presenting their opinions, I feel like doing a segment about something like astrology while knowing that it's rooted in Superstition, dishonesty and greed is intellectually numbing, and the fact that it was taken seriously disappointed me to no end.&gt; NDT

Non-destructive testing?Neil deGrasse Tyson, scientific arrogance extraordinaire.I totally feel ya, but no one can deny that he likes to go overboard for giggles. Yeah, surrounded by a panel of liberals. 

Let's see how Trump is reacting to the downtown in the economy, we're joined by our contributers and a host from Univision.i only listen to npr, so i only know what they tell me, haha.  not sure where else to go on the radio for news to get different (but true) points of view.  I only listen when I drive.After what they did to a prairie home companion. Lol. Scrubbed from the internet damn nearlyTake your silly ass back to breitbartI admit to being a sucker for contemporary art, but I think [Barack](https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/q_auto,w_727,c_fit/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F180212113953-special-cut-barack-obama-portrait.jpg) and [Michelle's](https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/q_auto,w_727,c_fit/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F180212113917-special-cut-michelle-obama-portrait.jpg) portraits are both really, really awesome.

I like that this interview addresses how Wiley's work typically centers on the juxtaposition of the contemporary black experience with historical portraiture and the trappings of power it implies, and how that premise is undermined when the subject is both black and the leader of the free world. 

While it is still visually arresting, that context in Wiley's body of work is part of what makes Sherald's portrait of Michelle the stronger of the two in my mind. https://imgur.com/hMuwLAqIt absolutely is an interesting choice of artist. The Obamas' portraits are both a distinct move away from "oh that's nice to hang on the wall" decoration-type art, to the more contemporary notion of Art that provokes questions.

As to those beheadings, it's all down to classical paintings. The biblical* story of Judith beheading Holofernes, a general of  Nebuchadnezzar, was popular subject matter among baroque artists. 

In keeping with the rest of his works, Wiley re-staged this scene with modern-day models in contemporary dress. Like his other paintings, he's playing with power dynamics and raising questions about what is considered taboo, and how those change when taken out of their time. 

If you find the paintings of beheaded women shocking and affronting, I think the artist would be pleased. And isn't it interesting that we don't feel the same way about Caravaggio's painting from the 17th century?

(*It's not in the modern Bible. The book of Judith is one of the deuterocanonical books of the old Testament that didn't make the final cut one of the times the Church was deciding these things.)Thanks! It took a while to find a kindred spirit. All previous commenters deflect the blunders, or say they’ve never noticed, and focus on how great her voice is. 

In the rare event that she does a technically clean read, the tempo is not normal, and there are weird ...... flow-breaking pauses throughout!

One flub from yesterday I forgive: the strange name of a dog in the Westminster show ... that’s exactly the type of one-off error that any professional news reader could be expected to make.Asking whether the thing itself is racist is fraught, because by-and-large things are not racist, people are. It's an object, and only so much (regarding racism) can be asked of the thing itself. We have to look at the people around it—both creating and consuming it—and evaluate the way people respond to it. 


So we get to ask things like: 

* "Is the person who made it racist?" (And even so, does that make the thing racist? Is the sandwich my grandmother made me a racist sandwich?) 
* "Could it be used by racists to further their cause?" This is this is almost certainly the case, by those fuleing hate against white people and hate against black people alike. Does that make the *thing* racist? When tiki-torches (briefly) became a rallying symbol of white nationalists, were tiki torches racist?
* Was the intent of the creator to provoke or promote denigration of a race? Does the *intent* of the creator matter, if that's how it's going to be received? 
* And in this case: Do we interpret the characters depicted as *a* white woman being beheaded by *a* black women, or is this representative? Black *women* at large  beheading white *women*? And is it encouraging this behavior, or calling attention to it?

I think when it comes down to it, I would be comfortable calling something racist if it both: 
A) Is *intended* to be used to disparage a racial group or a person for being a member of that group and 
B) Is *likely* to be used to promote denigration of that group.

And in the end, if something *is* "racist," does that detract from its value as a work of art? Is it less visually engaging,  thought provoking, or important a reflection of humanity? What do you think? Also, 

&gt; Strictly speaking the purpose of art by volume has been to depict leaders literally removing the heads of enemies.

wat? I don't think that's the case, strictly speaking, by volume. The thing about calling objects racist is that they themselves become the object of reform, as through getting rid of the thing does some good. Whereas I think it's the actions of people that are much more problematic, and worthy of our attention. 

I would say that I observe a high degree of correlation between people who brandish the Confederate Battle Flag, and American Nationalists who overtly denigrate non-white people. 

I use that flag it as a helpful indicator that tells me something about the people hoisting it it. Taking their flag away doesn't do any good. Pulling a bumper sticker off their car doesn't keep them from inflicting ill-will on others. Now they are just harder to identify, and still hold their beliefs and presumably maintain their actions.I think you may be misinterpreting the restrictive clause there, because 

&gt;American Nationalists are racist

Is not an assertion I made. Moreover, I feel like you might be trying to draw me out into some emotional exchange that doesn't promise much interest. Please excuse me if I don't engage.Cmon man, don’t bring the “liberal bias” bullshit into play, npr IMO is the most neutral news source someone can get, they report facts not guesses, if they bring in opinions, they tend to get one from both sidesDonvan's not bad.They have no bias and are absolutely in how they cover stories, and tons about the stories they decide to air.Wait what r u trying to say in ur post lol I think I misread?Wow - this one is the best yet! Between saying Australia on both ends of the story, she mentions that the reporter is in Vienna. It’s an archetype “ugly American”  trope (Austria = Australia, Sweden = Switzerland). 

Thanks for posting, we are not alone! 

wow, I am thinking Tom is one of the best host...what's her issue?do you example of what he did. It seems like "he is difficult to work with", but not related to sex harassment?&gt; creating a hostile work environment.

do you have example of he "creating a hostile work environment"?Lucky, I was on a cruise that day so couldn’t listen to his last day on air&gt; Are you asking for examples of what would constitute a hostile work environment just as an example?

yes I am asking for examples of what would constitute a hostile work environment?unless he push boundary to extreme, do we not see this every day? to some who is sensitive to criticism, a feedback will be interpreted as being yelled at. I love Steve Inskeep he’s awesomeIt reminds me of another report from years ago. It may have been a This American Life piece about an essayist and his or her fact-checker. 

As I remember it, the writer had composed an essay about someone who committed suicide, and a recurring cadence of their piece revolved around the number of seconds the fall to the ground took. The fact checker disagreed about the amount of time it would take to fall that distance(?) and then the two spiraled out into a larger debate of fact versus truth... 

Memory gets hazy here, but I think it went off the rails at that point. They may have published their exchange about edits on this piece as a book in its own right? And then it may have come out that part of that exchange was fabricated for the sake of the book, itself purporting to examine the importance of truth and fact?

Does anyone else remember this? It sounds like an On-the-Media-inspired fever dream...&gt; there's no reason for it to be a negative experience

I agree "there's no reason for it to be a negative experience"does ugly Office politics count?ok, I agree with you. 
but get involved in office politic is much more stressful if in the losing side.[Link to the segment.](https://www.npr.org/2018/02/15/586171960/a-look-at-all-18-shootings-that-have-taken-place-in-2018-on-school-property)https://www.npr.org/2018/02/15/586171960/a-look-at-all-18-shootings-that-have-taken-place-in-2018-on-school-propertySorry, I should have been more specific for how that appears on mobile. I included the link in my first comment. But thanks for following up!good for you :)I’m 18 so still in high school, a sad reality indeedOh ok it wasn’t showing blue for me when u first posted it, now it doesIt is indeed....Lemme guess, propaganda is all news sources except breitbart and fox?You’re mental[Here's a link to the segment.](https://www.npr.org/2018/02/16/586315557/gop-rep-brian-mast-on-florida-school-shooting)Soma is basically my only music listening these days. The stations are just so good. Digitalis is by far my favorite though. I did not know that. Thank you for the clarification!lol NPR isn't the center and so who should centrists listen to? Limbaugh? So no one should listen to anything besides NPR? Kinda a strange ideaNo, the day Darren Wilson was acquitted they were too busy playing smooth jazz and talking about art related to clouds to talk about the actual news lol. Its pseudo intellectual drivel half the timeThanks! Appreciate itI don't think it's possible to be unbiased. Everyone looks at news with their own perception and background, as well as an ideology that colors the way that they interpret what's going on. That's just my opinion. [It's sad when even 4chan gets it.](https://i.redd.it/c7fgqari97cy.png)It really doesn't. Humanity is left leaning in the sense that it's always looking for what's best. 

But once your set in your ways, good enough, everything's working nice, fuck it, conservative please. Don't rock my boat 

And even then...your opinions will change!!! Democrats used to back up white supremacists in Wilmington NC 1960Yep, can't believe he replaced the Dianne rheem show!!!!I listen to NPR over 8 hours a fucking day

Sensationalist just means entertaining. NPR is boring af!!! like which shows?&gt; Over the years, the NRA has also become involved in litigation, such as the lawsuit challenging the personal handgun ban in the District of Columbia. That case eventually reached the Supreme Court, which struck down the law in **the landmark Heller decision in 2008**.

&gt;**The decision enshrined the longstanding NRA tenet that the Second Amendment right to firearms was meant for a private individual** as well as a "well-regulated militia."Fair enough! 

I admit it's petty, and that I need more work to become an enlightened human being, but can't help feeling satisfied/vindicated that 3 weeks later:
 
* I've provided 50+ indisputable examples for fans/apologists who "love her voice" and claim to have "never noticed" blunders. Should someone at NPR responsible for her "performance reviews" find the thread, it makes documentation of her shortcomings relative to the other readers much easier.  
* The thread has 623 views, 15 points (70% upvoted)

Thank you, just check http://news.wypr.org/schedule#stream/0, and your station's national program is different. your 10am is on point, and mine is 10-12am 1A. I wish we have 1 hour onpoint, 1 hour 1AThank you. Why local station need to pay fee to npr? Is it safe to say with more donor and budget, local station can maintain more staff to do local news and report, otherwise just spend the money to buy national program?Why not pay content creator directly?*1A* is often a fixed schedule since it is broadcast live, and they want to include listener responses on air.does that mean NPR is like Visa, and local station affiliated with NPR is like "Chase Visa card"?nice analogy!KUOW Seattle here. 

By 9 or 10pm, they switch into Canadian Public broadcasting and it’s frustrating because unless it has cheese curds on it, I’m not interested!fascinated. Thank you! some followup questions. 
1. 
let's say you work at WNYC, your station is affilated with NPR (Headquarter at DC) and you pay annual license fee to air NPR content, can your station affilated with other content provider like PRI (BBC ?)? I assume you are more likely to affilate with 
NPR because massive content, cheaper?, and also NPR is a widely recognized brand so you can also benefit from it when compete with other radio station?

2. is there prestige npr member stations, similar to newspaper world?

Thank you!Hence my phrasing, including the word "often."Thank you for your insight. 
With online stream get popular, audience not necessarily tune in to radio. does local station feel pressure? my local station air 1a from 10-12, sometimes the topic is not that great, i just go online and switch to onpoint. I found I use online stream more and more, particularly with google home...
Thank you:)Thank you I am following the twitterIt was Sunday night around 7 pm cst . I tried looking on NPR website but it must be some sort of other radio syndicate show...?Omg thank you! I found it!! I listen to KCUR in Kansas City and looking up there schedule led me to wnyc.org. The program is On the Media and the segment is Dreams of Wakanda, the song is called Mai Nozipo by Kronos Quartet. Feels like Northern European violin reel meets African drums. So exited! I should have clarified that. Yes, I am EST. 6:04 EST update

Checked on two different podcast apps, and on three different webpages with RSS feeds.  No new episode yet for today.

It is, however, on Up First's [official page](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510318/up-first).If not, this fuck needs to be taken into a small field and beaten like a feral animal.

I can't begin to wrap my head around this proto-fascist behavior (and I mean Mr. Silberman), so I'd rather wrap a bat around his head a hundred times.Is there any reason this is posted in /r/NPR that I'm missing? How did our little sub get blessed with such a contribution?Double check me, see if I'm following:

This tweet  references an incident which occurred at an event hosted by Kai Ryssdal, and portions of that event (but not this incident) were aired on Marketplace? Really? Every hacker in the world has an infrastructure in place to do pretty much whatever they put their minds to in the form of a bot net. For a sovereign country, infrastructure for hacking is trivial at best...which is why nobody bothers mentioning it.It'll get republished straight-faced on breitbart within a month, but with more ALL CAPS.Thank you :)&gt;“Lost Mothers” explored why the U.S., which spends more per capita on health care than any other country, also has the highest rate of maternal mortality in the developed world

Here's [ProPublica's announcement](https://www.propublica.org/atpropublica/propublica-npr-lost-mothers-series-wins-goldsmith-prize-for-investigative-reporting) describing the project, and [their own work](https://www.propublica.org/article/lost-mothers-maternal-health-died-childbirth-pregnancy) separate from the NPR content.Are you sure about that?

Silly as fuck. The first time I heard Jim Hawk about a month ago I thought it was his first time at this as he sounded kinda inexperienced but then I realized he's only on during the weekends it seems.  He kinda sounds like a substitute host of sorts. Yea they’re doing the same thing for white People, NOR talked about it a few months ago The thumbnail led me to believe there would be puppets. I feel misled and personally slighted.Shea would probably say it’s “peTEE” ... just like she mispronounced Tempe (Arizona) on today’s 12am broadcast by incorrectly placing stress on the second sylLAble. 

Please donate.This all sounds weird.  They had just unionized, but they hadn't re-negotiated contracts yet. They're hiring seven new positions after letting these seven go. 

I think I don't understand most of management. I grew up in a right-to-work state; unions are still hard for me to understand.Today Fresh Air featured a review of "[Blockers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfFcaV5O7SU)" so ...What keeps them from applying to the new places as union workers?

Zuckerberg probably has the upper hand on (occasional) brutal honesty, but mostly feels completely disingenuous at all times. &gt; Boston, can we talk?
&gt; 
&gt; I’ve loved you since I was 16 and came east from Illinois on a truck full of hogs to look at the fancy schools. That truck took me to Philly, then I caught a bus to Back Bay. On that long-ago summer evening, I walked out of the old Trailways station, took in the sights and sounds of Boston, and fell in love.
&gt; 
&gt; Over the years that love deepened. Having babies here, raising kids, working for the Globe, starting a dot-com. There were serious stints in other parts of the world, but Boston — with its gritty independence and keen intellectual pride — became home.
&gt; 
&gt; After Sept. 11, 2001, NPR came calling through WBUR-FM Boston and asked if I would host emergency coverage of the 9/11 attacks with the redoubtable son of Dorchester, Jack Beatty. We said yes of course, and the very next day we were on 500 stations around the country, comforting and informing a nation in shock. That coverage became the show called “On Point.”
&gt;
&gt; In time, with a lot of work from a lot of great people, “On Point” became something special. Here was Boston hosting a vigorous national conversation around ideas and how they ran through our politics and the arts, science and technology, philosophy and society. It was thrilling, and a natural for this city. I was so lucky to be a part of it.
&gt; 
&gt; In December, following allegations against me made by several employees, I was put on leave pending two investigations by WBUR’s owner, Boston University. The investigation, which looked into allegations of sexually inappropriate conduct, concluded favorably for me, but the second workplace assessment found that my conduct had created an abusive work environment. After 16 years hosting “On Point,” I was fired.
&gt; 
&gt; My firing came in the heat of the #MeToo movement, which I support, believe in, and applaud. I never imagined being a target. I should have been more self-aware of my own behavior and sensitive to the people around me. But I wasn’t, and for that there is no excuse. When I was pulled aside in the middle of a workday and told, “You have to go,” my first response was defensiveness and shock. Bullying? I had thought it was passion and commitment. And the show had thrived.
&gt; 
&gt; But high ratings are no excuse for inexcusable behavior. A good talk show host knows there’s a time to dig deep and just listen. So I did. These past months, I have listened and looked inward and focused on the complaints and my own actions. I’ve absorbed their weight. And bit by bit, I’ve come to see and fully own my mistakes. My behavior was offensive and overbearing to some. As the wondrous song goes, “T’was blind, but now I see.” I have thought long and hard about better ways to do great work — better ways to be. I realized I had to change my approach.
&gt; 
&gt; All over the country there is a great realignment going on, and this is good. We are in a historic teaching moment and learning moment. My story is a small part of that. I am responsible for what happened. I own it. I’m sorry for it. I’ve learned from it and will continue to learn. I’ve paid a price and come to greater understanding — understanding I long to demonstrate and share.
&gt; 
&gt; Is there room for redemption and rebirth, in our time of Google trails and hashtag headlines? I hope so. The work that Boston and the country supported all these years is more important than ever. Is there a way back?
&gt; 
&gt; Can we talk some more, Boston? I promise this time to listen as respectfully off the air as on. I want to make Boston proud again.
&gt; 
&gt; *Tom Ashbrook was host of NPR’s “On Point.”*well, they can't rotate host until the perfect one is found. 

it used to be "onpoint &gt; 1A", now "1A&gt;onpoint", it show the importance of the host. I wonder if there is rating system somewhere for these national radio programs. Or "investing in mobility" as I heard one of the marketplace weekend hosts put it.
I've only heard her like once or twice, so I don't have an opinion on her yet.  But I loved when she said "s**thole" live on air one morning that I heard her.  I thought it was great. Oh so she's really out front with the public?  That's always good.  Speaking of that, doesn't Jack Speer do a lot of public appearances for NPR too?Well sheesh.  These other newscasters should get with the program and start getting out in front of the public.  Except for the people who do overnights as it would be hard for them to make public appearances during the day. I agree with your assessment. I am sorry for his staff working with him, it must be a stressful. But as a listener, I am very disappointed.Ok that makes sense.  I don't listen everyday even though I wish I could, but it just seemed like I was hearing a lot of Mary Louise and not much of anyone else.  And I didn't know they made a calendar ahead of time that's really cool.  I figured they just decided at the start of the week something like "Ok Ari and Audie you're up for hosting this week.  Mary Louise and Ailsa, you'll be doing other stuff around the office."  Hey since you're an editor you should find out why the TED Radio Hour is so re-run heavy and either reply back or PM with your answer.  I promise the secret stays with me. Oh my that's my bad.  I mean we all listen so we all think that's how they're spelled out.  I guess I didn't check the webpage before posting.Like I just replied to the last commenter, I didn't check the websites or Wikipedia for spelling before posting so that's my bad. I do wish everyone hadn't blatantly pointed it out like that, but at least we're catching things and no one knows who's who on here so I'm not too sore about it. Maybe she just needs a little re-training. I caught the same type of mistake from others in the past few weeks, mostly reporters though. I get it that professionalism is needed, but a lot of us gaffe from time to timeCredit to: https://twitter.com/GillisDoodlesI haven’t been listening very much recently, but when I did, it was often another reader ... I was hoping that she was on the way out/retiring... 

Thanks for posting!Periodic on-air promos reiterating that while they have halted their campaign (for coverage of Barbara Bush's funeral) if you still want to donate, the phone lines are open, and they'd appreciate your support. Ugh ... just listened to half of the newscast for 04-25-2018 2AM EST and it is worse than ever! The tempo/pauses are unforgivable, especially combined with the very forgivable “frog in throat” that can happen to any public speaker. 

In the beginning of becoming frustrated, I assumed that she was merely reading “copy” and as such, was an unwitting victim of bad writing. After searching for more info on her and finding nothing, I came across info that the readers prepare their own stories between each newscast. So, what we’re hearing is the best she can do, even after writing and preparing the stories (e.g. one would assume a reader wouldn’t set him/herself up for tongue-twisters). 

Edit: link to her bio claiming she writes the stories before ~~reading~~ flubbing them

&gt; NPR Newscaster Shay Stevens writes and delivers five-minute round-ups of national and international news, aired on more than 790 stations to 25.5 million listeners each week.
 

They can change it to 25,499,999 listeners now!&gt;then they also don't fit the hypermasculine description of what they think would be attractive


But I thought Mister Rogers was the first inductee to the Masculinity Vision Board?

This just doesn’t make sense.I haven't noticed this.[The stories I see](https://www.npr.org/2018/04/26/605944189/after-decades-calif-authorities-arrest-suspected-golden-state-killer) use the "Golden State Killer" name.I feel like the logo might be the least of OP's concerns.He was known by lots of different names. I think he was known as the “East Side Rapist” longer than the “Golden State Killer”. 

Might be the reason why. More people would know who they’re talking about as the “East Side Rapist”. I am not a 911 operator but I’m curious as to what some of what your opinions were on the episode.Let me tell you this-- /r/Drama is one of the most malevolent, cruel, coldhearted online communities you'll ever find, and even as a supporter of free speech it appalls me that Reddit would allow such a vile, festering hub of bigotry and sadism to exist. You think [slur]town was bad? That subreddit, if you pick up on the dog-whistles (and many don't even bother with that-- say want you want about Stormfront, at least it bans "n[slur]"), will reveal itself to you as Reddit's number one hub for the web's most hardened Nazis, Klansmen, Fascists, and Gamergaters. You'll notice on the sidebar that it encourages members to be as dramatic as possible. That's intentional. They encourage arguments in the comments section. That's intentional. You know the Three Minute Hate (it's from this underrated book 1985, give it a read, it's scary how much it parallels our society)? It's like that, they want to stoke the flames of reactionary rage so they continue to dogpile every progressive and minority who enters the subreddit, normalizing these evil feelings. They brigade from subreddit to subreddit, having an entire cabal of mods spanning hundreds of communities, gaslighting lived experiences of the oppressed and unashamedly bolstering Reddit's homegrown white supremacy movement. They've kink-shamed hundreds of people too, some even... to death. I fear that /r/drama may be producing an entire army of Dylann Roofs and Elliot Rogers, and I highly suggest that nobody dares visit that horrible subreddit, lest you potentially fall victim to its corruptive aura.There are literal serial killers and rapists posting there.Tfw not pretty enough to be raped 😔Until recently I would have said the closest analogue to Diane Rehm was [On Point](http://www.wbur.org/onpoint), and it still may be, but the show seems to be in some degree of limbo now with Ashbrook out.

If you like hearing from multiple guests, you might enjoy [Intelligence Squared Debates](https://www.intelligencesquaredus.org/) hosted by Jon Donvan. It centers less on current events, and is the format of a formal debate, so it's really very different from DR, but generally has good content.

Another long-form program that I think is probably underappreciated is [Think](http://think.kera.org/) produced by KERA. I can't remember them ever having a panel on, but I think the host does a really good job examining topics, and is probably the best at handling callers (now that Talk of the Nation, Dianne Rehm, and Tom Ashbrook are all gone)What a treasure. A bygone era, to be sure.Did Conan's just end? I remember them "stopping weekly produciton" a month or so ago, but I don't know what they're planning on doing from here on out.It's a pithy answer, but I do like *1A* for this.It's very strange, to me. They had a whole range of sub-in hosts for Rehm, and if they'd wanted to keep making that show, I think they could have found one among that set (or someone else) to take the reins. 

Johnson just seems to be making a *different* show. 1A isn't very like The Dianne Rehm Show at all. This is not in itself a problem. I admire NPR developing a wide range of new programming. But it seems odd that this unrelated production is for some reason deemed the "successor" to Dianne Rehm show. It's such a different animal. My first thought with this headline was ‘why are they quoting Hamilton’?
Second thought : d’ohJafomofo addresses part of it, someone else gave a good airing of grievances [elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/NPR/comments/8gx2cf/today_joshua_johnson_mispronounced_kanyes/dyn3bqj/) that goes a long way to it as well. 

I think I have what might be an old-fashioned idea that even hot-button topics can be discussed and covered dispassionately without emotional charge, and that that generally improves the quality of the discourse (not to mention likelihood of a resolution.) I don't feel as though that's the kind of conversation Johnson tends to direct.

It's just not a show for me. And it's probably good for NPR that not 100% of their programming is targeted to Me as a demographic. I remember the day his firing was announced . They said their were two investigations.  Basically bullying and sex abuse / #metoo. He was cleared of the latter but fired for the former. Fired for fostering a nasty work environment. Is there more to the story since then?What do people look for in an NPR app? I use a couple of apps for radio streaming, what am I missing?They had a lot longer to get ready for the Royal Wedding. I bet pieces were planned if not produced weeks ago. Couple that with the general fate of stories that break on a weekend and it seems almost inevitable that a unexpected Friday story will be eclipsed by a high-profile event with lots of advance notice.

I expect a lot more coverage staring Monday, when the journalists are back in the office. Even newsrooms have weekends (for better or worse. Blame labor unions :P )When my gf was lactating i drank it every day. 

Tastes like almond milk. 1. I like almond milk

2. It’s coming out of a beautiful boob, man! How can anyone not like that!?Where do you get your crack? I’d drink that. Bro, you just pour it into a saucepan and heat it up a little bit. 

Have you ever had a breast milk latte? I have. Deeeeelish!!! No lie. Nice try, *Mr. Fabrizio.*"chock-full"

From the Middle English *chokkeful,* “crammed full.”I don't know of any Negative filters, but I've heard on NPROne you can pick and choose only the stories you want to hear to your playlist.It's always fun to recognize a snatch of music in the middle of morning edition. i'm following! In the meantime, mind sharing some of your favorites from last year?Thank you! Such a good playlist, had it in everyday at the pool. Just looked it up and that’s it! Thank you so much. I've heard ["Buena" by Morphine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpSIIyLjLNs) as the bumper on Morning Edition in the past.  Made me happy.This is a great link, thanks!It wasn’t Snap Judgment (but thanks for the suggestion); there was no narrator, just this dude telling stories in the present tense, weird as hell and speaking to himself stream of consciousness style. Anyone?I think this is the guy! Old NPR Playhouses or something? I remember his voice being a bit deeper and drunk sounding than most of these clips but it may have just been one of those nights.

Corey Flintoffee puddingI enjoyed having new guest hosts every week (particularly Ray Suarez, Meghna Chakrabarti and Kimberly Atkins) but it is getting kind of old. http://www.wbur.org/news/2018/02/14/tom-ashbrook-dismissedYou can always listen to it as a podcast later or stream online.I agree. I usually listen in the afternoons and by then it seems a lot less relevant due to all the news that has broken since it was taped.You're the best!Dave is bout dat life I believe a while ago. He said he thinks they mentioned Robin Williams so it might have been aired right around his death. And it's still happening now! I am getting a little annoyed to be honest. Does anybody know why they are doing this? I want new content. Not content from 2013. If I want that I'll just go back to then.I did a count recently, and got around 10 new episodes, but that was before "Inspire To Action" and "Attention Please" originally aired on May 18th and 25th.  So we're around 15 new episodes with a lot of reruns besides.  I noticed a trend too, that every other week was a rerun, with a few exceptions where new or repeat episodes were aired consecutively.

I think Guy Raz has too much on his plate now that he's hosting "Wow In The World" and "How I Built This" as well as that "Breakfast Blast Newscast" thingamabob he does.  Maybe it's time for him to drop a project or two, because I'm sure that at least one of the other shows I just mentioned has a similar broadcast schedule thanks to that. Or at least say why he is doing it, you know? I know it's still free and all, but I feel like iam being cheated on. Or do part old part update.But thanks for the investigation. I didn't go that far yet.
You're welcome.  I feel like I'm being cheated too.  Plus the reruns never seem to interest me as much as the new ones, with a few choice exceptions ("Painfully Funny" and "Crisis &amp; Response") immediately come to mind. Same here. Some of the reruns are pretty cool. Some of my favorite episodes were a rerun the first time I heard them. But I really wish they'd quit constantly running episodes from 2015 all the time. What about something more recent instead of 3 year old informationThanks for the lead! I found the transcript of this Fresh Air and let my husband read it and unfortunately it isn't what he is referencing. At this point, I'm wondering if he dreamt it up. ;) 

I really appreciate the help. Thanks again!Ye indeed. Or at least give some context why you are doing it. It´s like there sneaking in episodes now just for the ad revenue. I know they are still free and some of em i haven´t heard but still..Ye i don´t think that is itYe they feel out of date. In the time that they have been published and rerun many thing have changed most of the time. 

 I don´t think i heard those one yet. i´ll look them upThe guy said a whole lot of nothing and Kai should have sunk his teeth in a little bit more. He made it seem like NN was about getting internet access to all and said the polls that are against him were carefully crafted to get a particular demographic and the population is against NN. I can’t imagine selling out your entire country in such a way. You have to be such an evil POS to try to ruin the Internet for your whole country...Reading the transcript now (if [this](https://www.marketplace.org/2018/06/07/world/Ajit-Pai-FCC-Net-Neutrality) is the right one) I'm glad it was Marketplace and that Ryssdal didn't just let every shit sandwich slide by unchallenged. 

But the fact that Pai was able to leave the building walking unaided is still evidence that Ryssdal was too easy on him.Yeah, I’d be interested to listen to the whole 20 min podcast when I get a chance, I think we only got the 5-10 min segment on KQED and I only heard the last 2-3 mins, but that’s all it took to get me upset on my way to eat a delicious burrito. Thanks for the tip. We have already tried this but came up empty. It may just be one of those things he will remember more details about in 3 years and we find it then. Thanks again!I've looked for other sources and nothing comes close. Almost everything else is nauseatingly biased towards one side or the other. Also, most stuff isn't politics, they have a ton of interesting shows that deal with science, history, pretty much everything. They are certainly socially liberal but as about as fair as you can find nowadays. Can you be more specific and can you point me to some other good radio programs?If it's  "NEW CLE UR" (nu-cle-ar) I will completely rescind my statement.  Still waiting on the jury.

Edit:  Also being lazy right now, have not looked it up on Webster's yet.

2nd Edit: I looked it up on Webster's (your link) and you are correct, I am a horse's ass.I'm not going to share my view on cement.Didn't realize I deleted it, didn't mean to.

Darel SnodgrassHow can you deny the purity of the Hop? Don't get me wrong, Jazz is wonderful, but not the weirdo Martian off-key stuff where you're supposed to guess the chords that are supposed to be played. I feel like the new music selections embrace a newer generation of listeners. Like the listener is getting important news, but with a mixtape feel, hard drums and all.... Yes I'm biased. Sing it from the roof tops. I can do that at home ;-)I prefer an Aesop Rock or an RJD2 instrumental, but I'll take what I can get. I have no clue, but keep um coming. Give praise!Clicked hoping NPR Music Selector was an app. Am disappointed.Well in South Florida the NPR music is banging. Pigs is such an underrated track. One of my alltime favorites. Best kazoo solo ever! ;-)Then give him a raise!Let um know!Yeah!  I heard that too a few weeks ago.  He also played some quest when phife died and some mf doom I agree. It's a new age. He guest hosts On Point quite a bit these days. He actually did last week and did an incredibly entertaining hour about The Simpsons. Oh really, do you do to the store and ask for a baguette in a snooty French accent?Lol, ok, so it’s not just me and Latinos can be annoyed by it to. If a Volkswagen cut you off in traffic, would you angrily pronounce that word with a thick German accent?Aw, thanks.

I'm sure someone *somewhere* has this info already, but I haven't been able to find it!

ETA: I've put the GoogleDoc up with comment permission. I'll be working to get the WNYC info in first, then fill in any other info I come across about earlier podcasts and recordings. (Time permitting, I'll also audit the recordings I have access to and verify the information on the spreadsheet.)Interesting approach.  

His brother does not.  For example listen to 11:32 "I did the music for the opening of the Olympics"-- normal "L" pronunciation.

Now listen to Ira- this is a random video I grabbed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDdIgpdDIss
At 16:01 "Every plot is raised that way" (sounds like pot)
At 29:23 "I'd never seen famous people before, like, in my life". (sounds like yife)

Wow ! Fascinating. I only understand 30% of it, but, it’s fascinating.&gt;These station programming fees comprise a significant portion of NPR's largest source of revenue. The loss of federal funding would undermine the stations' ability to pay NPR for programming, thereby weakening the institution.

Also, **universities and colleges** that give NPR and their sister organization that also receive tax money is essentially redistributing the money given to them from tax payers. 


Don't they kind of deserve it at this point?Well, there is listener membership and product sales, why can’t the people themselves fund the portion government is too? 

In the NPR report I linked NPR states

&gt;Covering the news requires significant resources. The funds NPR receives from corporate donors are an important part of the revenues that fuel NPR's in-depth reporting and programming

So they are already “beholden” to Corporate money. They also go to state that in many ways that they don’t let it influence their programming. They also don’t have to announce their donors and can accept/reject anyone. 

So my other question would be then, at what point of corporate sponsorship will NPR “not report the truth”?Bleep bloop bleepI AM REQUIRED TO GIVE UP MY MONEY!!! My god, that is the whole point of the post.


I work. 

They take money that I work for in taxes (If I don’t pay my taxes,I go to jail). 

Someone decides how much goes to NPR. 

Why is that fair when there are more radio stations and shows out there than I can possibly list that do not take my money, but NPR/PR gets my money especially when it has more anti-American sentiment everyday (in my opinion, but everyone knows NPR is left leaning). Knee-haa-rhaaa-hkuah im almost certain it wasn't tedx, but it could've been a radiolab segment. the time of day would've most likely been evening (7ish) to midnight? ish, about.Thanks u/better-off but that's not the one I'm looking for.Susan Shockley!
I also got Scott Schaffer and Robin Williams, which are legitimately names of people. 
This is excellent. &gt; https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/91501-there-is-no-lord-of-the-fireflies/

i listened through but i dont think this was it, thanks thoI am from southwest PA and we do the same. The car needs washed, the cat  needs fed. I wonder if there is a common immigrant background . Dutch? German?Is... is there a NPR tradition of hot dogs I don't know about?Been checking through Radiolab episodes. I'd hate to do the same for another show but don't have much options.I find that Guy is getting too loose with the show. He trips over his words a lot and sometimes seems a little rough in interviews.  I think he's getting fatigued from hosting four shows at once, even though some air less often than others.

If he ever leaves I hope to be far enough ahead in my radio career that I could take over the program. I'm not saying I'm the best for the job, but I would at least produce more new episodes in a year than he's been doing 😉🙊I hope this is sarcastic I actually heard this reported as a straight news story on WNYC which surprised me a little. It will be interesting to see who he gets as guests. On one hand, I've been somewhat enjoying the revolving door of guest hosts. On the other, it's been going on for almost six months now with no sign of slowing down. I can't help but wonder if the show would benefit more with a permanent host sooner rather than later, because it's kind of a grab bag at this point. No idea where they are in that process. 

Sidenote: Linda Wertheimer appears to be hosting the rest of the week, and while it's incredibly pleasant to hear her voice again, yesterday's hours felt a little all over the place as  /u/Cranley213 said earlier. Yeah, today’s was not great. Someone needs to get Linda a lozenge, and I tuned out by the second hour because I wasn’t interested. Hoping tomorrow’s Week in the News roundtable is better.She probably is only able to guest host On Point (and Here and Now as well) as she hosts WBUR's local show Radio Boston. I'd like her as the main host, though.Mine too. Gotta love Jack Beatty!same, sometimes I just really want to talk about a Tiny Desk performance. looks like there is /r/tinydesk which does not seem very active atm but maybe that can change. The only one I’ve ever seen was Macklemore doing Thrift Shop.  It was bad enough to make me not want to watch anymore. Which is not  Macklemore’s fault, really.  He committed. The crowd wasn’t there for him, though.  They were *polite. * Which is death for humor rap. I'll keep an ~~eye~~ ear out for it!

Older recordings are rebroadcast at times, so perhaps it will surface again as par of a show with a spooky/uncanny theme. 

(Have you looked over the themed anthologies sold by Symphony Space? Perhaps it's part of one of those.)You gotta show this to someone at NPR and try getting them to sell it!!!I listen mostly via Apple Music/iTunes. The scheduling isn't exactly the same as my local station (On Point doesn't air until the late afternoon for example), but they air Here and Now from 12-2 when my local station is blasting classical and I can catch Morning Edition and ATC on a loop for hours.Just remember the NPR rule of discussing race: non-white persons or groups do not exist unless they are somehow being abused by whites.I'm incredibly satisfied with this. Other than Ray Suarez or Anthony Brooks, I would say these were the most engaged guest hosts and they hosted enough times to get a good handle on the feel of the show.He is only hosting Fridays and he’s doing it out of New York, so we should still hear plenty of reports from him outside of On Point.TIL it’s Meghna not Megan.  So funny how the ear can auto correct to an expected set of sounds ..... 

I think it’s a fine choice , good luck to them. I remember when the  announcement came out. Exonerated from sexual harassment, fired for toxic work environment .  He was really good at his job and is a smart guy. Too bad he screwed himself over so badly. "We cannot let this become the new normal", I'm not so sure about. Trump was elected democratically. When people vote for president, they are casting a vote for the timbre of the national conversation as well. Clearly people wanted this, it isn't as though Trump suddenly became norm breaking on Jan. 20 2017, he was norm breaking from the get go. I'm also concerend about the implication that we have to stop this from becoming norm breaking by having the media tear down the Trump admin at every turn.Oh I don't care about those fatuous words. 

He is doing more or less exactly what I wanted him to do when I voted for him. I do want a wall, and I do want more deportations. At least a million a year, preferably several million. 

I could do without the pornstar scandals though.Here &amp; Now and On Point are my absolute must listens. &gt;only able to guest host On Point

They announced she will shot Monday-Thursday.Well yes, because she is leaving Radio Boston to do it.My station drop On Point a few months back. I still tune in their web stream once in a while. But man, that show's quality going down hill unbelievably. What the management think!?&gt;Jane Clayson

 Jane Clayson has a good background, and voice"Peter likes to put a pun here, but I'm above that." Thought that one was underrated. I don’t really think it needs to be a competition on which city is covered in the most human shit. 

This particular story is about San Francisco. 

I live in Seattle and there are plenty of people here that would identify with this story. &gt; San Francisco has become "a magnet" for the homeless because the city has boosted spending to fight the crisis over the past five years, Nuru says. The West Coast cities of Seattle, San Diego and Sacramento, Calif., are also experiencing severe shortages of affordable housing.

&gt;"A large number of the people we see on our streets are not necessarily from San Francisco," he says. "They are coming from surrounding counties and, in some cases, across state lines."


This right here shows the ridiculousness of how NPR, and the leaders of these cities portray the problem. 

In the first paragraph, it literally says that the city is a “magnet” ***because*** it has boosted spending (thrown money at it) over the past 5 years. 

*Then* it states that other cities are also experiencing “shortages of affordable housing” as if “affordable housing” (the catchphrase the leaders of the homeless industrial complex use) is the cause of meth addiction, mental illness, and general shitty people that don’t want to contribute to the society they leach off of. 

**THEN** on top of all that, the Mayor admits that a large number of people aren’t even *from* San Francisco. So in the end it goes back to SF attracting chronically homeless people, because it is permissive of that lifestyle. 


The mental gymnastics Paris Dennard constantly does on those Wednesday segments to make everything Trump does sound like it's the greatest thing ever would be hilarious if it weren't so terrifying. I feel like even Jeremy Hobson and Robin Young are blown away by it. I'm Grid Wallace and you're listening to NPR. Damask Shakur, NPR News, DAKARRRRRRRPlaid Holiday... NPR news. @HereandMeowIt’s silly. 

They’re deporting  a fucking skeleton. Even if it’s symbolic, it’s dumb. 
It’s the same as when the Catholic Church dug up a Pope to put him on trial. Yes. I’m sure shipping this one 95 year old skeleton to Germany is going to make it a little bit better!

It’s all about the principle! Not whether or not the principle is idiotic. I was overtly implying that *you* are an idiot, but I guess it was a little more than a feeble twat could understand. 

So take your pick. Are you an idiot, a twat, or an idiotic, feeble twat?Good riddance. Him defending that insane Trump comment a few weeks ago about needing an ID to buy groceries with "well, obviously he was referring to alcohol" was the last straw. Everything out of his mouth is complete garbage. I agree with you as far as David. Will definitely be listening to Folkenflik Fridays.Did you listen to David Folkenflik yesterday?I'd say it's still worth checking out even if you aren't a fan of Meghna, but YMMV.Yes she has vocal  (kinda scratchy), along with a really nasally voice as well. Bad combo. Her tone was so very prickly and borderline unprofessional about all of it. I thought Irin Carmon (I believe it was her) responded to her with more poise than just about anyone else would have. I don't listen to the Takeway and the World, but it seems to me that Marketplace is clearly left-leaning economically in the sense that they constantly point out (real) issues with unfettered capitalism. Definitely not something you'd hear your average Republican politician bring up IMO.I was thinking of their criticism of capitalism specifically. The fact that "capital" is getting too much of the gains essentially.No she's in prison now.....Of course. But that was about *men*. 
Women don’t do anything wrong because vagina. It was strange but also cracked me up. Have a professional copywriter write it? I've always liked the phrasing "Helping musicians reach more ears through beers."  as it has a nice ring to it.  But I can understand where others are tired of it. 

&amp;#x200B;I think they hope the beer will help musicians be heard by more people?  Idk you make a good point here. Never heard of it. I'd doubt it's on there, but if it is, I'll be a happy camper.I'd suggest you love audio, not "radio." Part of what makes radio special is that it is ephemeral. On-demand audio is a different experience. 

But 90% of live radio is archived anyway. Your station would more than likely be thrilled to know you'd like more archival podcasts. Call &amp; tell em - most public radio stations take member/listener comments to heart. I heard Seth McFarland also did a dollar for dollar fundraiser for KPCC up to 250K
