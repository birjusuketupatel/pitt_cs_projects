it is great to be joined today by
Congressman ROA Khanna who represents
California's 17th congressional district
located in Silicon Valley in the Bay
Area among his many characteristics is
notable that he takes no corporate PAC
money we'll also talk about some of his
progressive stances congressman thank
you so much for being here today David
thank you for having me on so to begin
with let's talk about this issue of not
taking corporate PAC money I've seen
this as a potentially really important
sort of incremental move in the
direction of getting money out of
politics and it can be very hard when we
talk about that because it's such a big
issue to imagine the end point where we
ultimately want to be but it seems that
that's something that every candidate
and elected official can choose to do
right now in other words they don't need
a constitutional amendment to do that
they don't need to change the law they
can just say this is something I can do
do you see it as a sort of logical
incremental step in that direction I do
when I got to Congress I formed the
Notepad caucus along with beta or Roark
and I know when we did that it was very
controversial there were only seven of
us who didn't take PAC money out of 435
members of Congress and even some of
those seven who didn't take that but he
do want to be affiliated with the no PAC
caucus for fear of offending their
colleagues one I think you've seen the
success of Beto's campaign in Texas to
show that not taking PAC money is
actually a politically savvy move and
Connor Lamb who doesn't share my
politics is much more moderate he ran on
not taking PAC money in a moderate
district Alexandria Ocasio Cortes ran on
it in a liberal district I think it's
something that cuts across ideology and
it's something that signals to voters
that you want to change the system now
we need to go much beyond not taking PAC
money because the reality is I still
take contributions as do most people
from individuals were wealthy there are
a lot of contributions that come from
the max $2,700 and that gives a
disproportionate voice not to
single individual but to a given set
class of individuals only 5% or so
Americans contribute to political
campaigns so I propose with Russ
Feingold as build democracy dollars to
give every American citizen $50 to
contribute to campaigns I think that's
the kind of radical transformation that
we need for a democracy but no tax is a
important first step
yeah I was with Bakari sellers over the
weekend in Los Angeles at politican and
he uses this term unilateral disarmament
when it comes to a lot of political
issues but but also the issue of
accepting money and to some degree
you're you're not going to win if you
just say I'm going to give up every
element of how politics are financed so
to a certain degree you sort of need to
make that calculation but in thinking
about that what would be the next step
like after no corporate PAC money what
do you see as the next intermediate step
in the direction that that we ultimately
want to go I think looking at what
Bernie Sanders accomplished at a
presidential level of a bado
accomplished at a senatorial level and
then is expanding small dollar
contributions and Alexandria did this to
some extent in her congressional
campaign the challenge is how do you
expand your small dollar donors on
social media through organizing and how
do you do that if you're not a celebrity
right I mean Bernie Sanders obviously
had a celebrity factor and bado and
Ocasio to some extent by the end got a
celebrity factor but is there an
institutional way that progressives can
organize so that candidates for Congress
who may not be very famous or get Oh ton
of media attention can still develop a
grassroots donor basis and be less
reliant on maxout contributions and I
think all of us need to work towards
doing it so don't take PAC money
and expand grassroots fundraising I
think our two intermediate steps so I
want to stick with sort of financial or
economic money related issues for a
little bit being a representative of
Silicon Valley you follow closely what
happens with some of these large
corporation
which provide very useful products and
services there's no doubt they create
jobs but also they do receive the lion's
share of some of the benefits of the
status quo system that we have so I want
to talk about the Amazon $15 minimum
wage a little bit I have my thoughts on
it and and I know you have an
interesting take on it what was your
reaction when you saw that Amazon was
raising its minimum wage company-wide to
$15 well I think it was important
response to senator Sanders and I
introducing the stop Bezos Act we
basically called on Jeff Bezos about a
month before he increased his minimum
wage to do so and we said it's
ridiculous that Amazon is a trillion
dollar company and that yet they're not
paying their workers enough and their
workers are actually relying on food
stamps and public benefits and taxpayers
are having to subsidize employees at the
richest company in the world and that
the worker conditions aren't up to
standard in some of the warehouses they
haven't allowed unionization and we
explicitly said to send it to Jeff Bezos
be the Henry Ford of your time raise
wages in direct response to that Bezos
said I've heard my critics in the end in
fact tag senator Sanders and he said
that he was going to raise wages to $15
in some times it was a vindication for
senator Sanders and I because we were
attacked mercilessly by the Beltway for
going after Jeff Bezos now it's not
perfect the Jeff Bezos took away stock
options from workers who were not
minimum wage workers but middle-income
workers and he's taken away some of the
bonuses as I understand it 350,000
Amazon employees are still going to get
a pay raise and net they're better off I
wish he didn't take away those bonuses
but I still think it was a step in the
right direction and to some degree I
mean there's no doubt that it's the
right decision at the same time we all
know it's calculated and that there's a
PR benefit that also has a financial
value sort sort of attached to it and I
think it can be sometimes true
for progressives in these situations you
don't want to be seen as pooh-poohing
anything that these corporations do when
they do the right thing at the same time
it's a it's important and sometimes
difficult I I would argue to couch it in
a context where this is sort of like
safe activism right whether they pay 12
15 or 18 dollars the status quo in which
they can circumvent the tax law to avoid
paying taxes legally and all of this
other stuff it doesn't change that and I
think it does make it so that
progressives have to think carefully
about how to react to decisions like
this I agree I mean the it doesn't
change the fact that they may not be
supportive of unionization it doesn't
change the fact that they're paid zero
percent corporate tax in 2017 it doesn't
change the fact that we have to be
vigilant to make sure they don't acquire
a monopoly power in different industries
at the same time we do have to in my
view acknowledge when companies try to
take a step in the right direction so
that there are other companies like
Walmart or McDonald's who feel the same
incentive so that's also a job for
people like you I mean politicians that
we're gonna is celebrate if there's a
concrete outcome of success but I think
you have to hold not just the
politicians accountable but also
corporations accountable to say okay
it's a step in the right direction but
we still need a far more structural
change can you talk a little bit right
now about who you think can most
effectively hold corporations
accountable and to cut to contextualise
the question trial lawyers are very
divisive and controversial on the one
hand you hear a lot of critics of trial
lawyers including friends of ours down
at Levin Papantonio in Pensacola Florida
Mike Papantonio hosts a ring of fire and
others who are doing really really great
work you hear criticisms about so-called
trial lawyers that they get 30% of all
the settlement money that should go to
individuals and all sorts of critiques
of self-enrichment but at the same time
these corporations have such financial
resources it can take millions of
dollars to even get somebody like DuPont
to trial who other than these
well-resourced law firms can actually do
it so I'd love to hear from you a little
bit about what are the institutions that
can actually hold corporations
accountable in a real Dweck real way I
think the United States Congress can is
Bernie Sanders showed we by telling
people's stories and using the bully
pulpit of Congress effectively you can
really embarrass corporations into
thinking that there's a PR cost for them
if they are not treating their workers
well the other folks who can hold
corporations accountable are the workers
themselves it takes great courage for
workers at these companies to come
forward and tell their stories but when
they do when they organize and when they
share those stories and when you have
journalists like yourself amplify those
stories on social media I think that
puts tremendous pressure on corporations
so we shouldn't underestimate the role
of the bully pulpit in getting
corporations to do the right thing we
also need to relook at the rules though
of our free market system rules that
right now have benefitted stockholders
and those receiving dividends over
workers and we need to rewrite some of
those rules to make sure that you don't
have stock buybacks to make sure that
you do have workers represented on the
boards of these companies to make sure
that you have environments that permit a
unionization and those are things that
Elizabeth Warren Bernie Sanders or brown
have talked about and that if we have a
majority in Congress we should try to
pass in part two I definitely want to
touch on what would be the number what
would be the immediate to dues if indeed
the Democrats take over the house very
very soon in the midterm elections but
before we get to that what you mentioned
independent media a couple of times I am
curious I mean how much do folks in
Congress know about this sort of growing
tide of independent media outlets these
sort of alternatives to corporate media
that increasingly have larger and larger
audiences sometimes it can feel from our
end like we're sort of just
walking here and we don't know whether
those who are actually in positions of
power know about independent media is
this I mean how do you characterize that
or people they're aware of what we're
doing
the savvy ones are you know who was
aware of independent media is Donald
Trump he spent hours and hours giving
interviews not just to cable news but to
the right-wing alternative media going
on radio stations and radio programs
going and talking to internet bloggers
and he was very savvy about that
I think progressive politicians need to
realize that going on CNN and MSNBC and
having an article in The New York Times
is not sufficient that many people
listen to alternate media and that it's
a huge strategic advantage to get your
message out and I do think people like
Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and
some others have realized that and
that's to their advantage so I think
many people listen to you and those
politicians who don't take it seriously
are hurting their own strategic
interests of how to get a message out we
have been speaking with congressman roe
Khanna who represents California 17th
congressional district located in
Silicon Valley San Francisco Bay Area we
will pause our conversation with him
there and continue tomorrow we are
continuing our conversation with
congressman row Khanna who represents
California's 17th congressional district
to pick up our conversation congressman
you have taken a very I believe
principled approach when it comes to the
issue of our relationship with Saudi
Arabia and this relates to Yemen this
relates to the recent death of
journalist Jamal khashoggi this relates
to the arms deals what can be done
because it does seem to some degree like
an exercise in futility this
relationship that is in great part based
on sort of a shared interest in Middle
East stability concerns around oil
concerns around arms deals I mean is is
this thing too big to really interrupt
I don't think so even in my time in
Congress I've noticed a shift in public
opinion in an opinion on the hill I
started sounding the alarm about gammon
three months into my term and
Congress I was concerned about the
humanitarian crisis there and more I was
concerned that we don't get suckered
into another war in the Middle East the
neoconservatives wanted us to support
the Southey's efforts in Yemen as a
counter to Iran and as a check on Iran
they have been clamoring for us to get
into a conflict with Iran and I thought
that that would be a disaster since that
time when I introduced the War Powers
Resolution to stop our aid for the
Saudis there has been growing consensus
that this war must stop a part of it is
14 million people 12 to 14 million
Yemenis faced possible famine I mean
that's incomprehensible 800,000 people
died in Rwanda and here you're looking
at a scale of famine that is just
mind-blowing
and that has finally I think a post
Khashoggi awaken the conscience of many
members of Congress they realized that
Khashoggi was actually writing about the
Yemen war that's one of the reasons he
was murdered so now we have a growing
number of people in Congress who
recognize that the war must stop even
sexy mattes yesterday talked about the
war in Yemen stopping there a growing
number of folks who are questioning the
Saudi relationship
we just need continued citizen
mobilization we need to continue to
fight for this but I think this is a
issue that we can win and we must win
given the number of lives at stake how
concerned are you about this sort of
being enamored or impressed by
authoritarian types by the current
president right now and this applies to
Rodrigo Duterte dis applies to Kim
jong-un this applies to Bashar al-assad
it certainly applies to the Saudi royal
family is that a media only story or
does that have real-world diplomatic
impact no I am concerned that this
president hasn't spoken out clearly on
human rights and seems to be indifferent
to human suffering or human rights when
he deals with
dictators abroad his instincts as a
candidate to have less intervention
overseas I thought were promising in his
sense that we wanted to reset the
us-russia relationship to avoid another
Cold War that we shouldn't be
intervening in Syria that we should pull
our troops out of Afghanistan all of
that I thought was a necessary course
correction from a neoconservative
foreign policy but having restraint in
foreign policy doesn't mean that we
ignore human rights abuses we can
believe that we shouldn't be intervening
militarily in Syria but still believe
that Assad is a brutal terrible dictator
and speak out against his human rights
abuses that call for International
Criminal Court of Justice to deal with
war crimes we can believe that we
shouldn't be intervening in the Middle
East but still recognize the human
rights abuses of the Saudis and when it
comes to human rights this president has
had a blind spot that is not consistent
with American values I tend to look to
John Quincy Adams who said we shouldn't
be intervening abroad but we should
always have our prayers or hopes or
moral expressions on the side of those
who stand for freedom and human rights
so if Democrats do take over the house
in November ultimately in in January
they would be sworn in but not the
Senate what are the priorities do they
relate to geopolitics and foreign policy
is it domestic policy is it economic
versus social and obviously that you
have to kind of balance that with the
pragmatism of what can you do at this
point in all likelihood without a
Democratic Senate what are your top
priorities well I think they're
connected we should stop the wars
overseas and the trillions of dollars
we've spent overseas and put that money
into developing our own nation our own
education our own infrastructure the
Republicans have been for war overseas
and for tax cuts for billionaires for
giving people like Sheldon Adelson a 670
million dollar tax break the Democrats
should say we don't want that money
going into conflicts we can't win or to
the billionaire class we want that money
going in to build rebuild communities to
create jobs
community colleges to provide internet
for everyone to provide healthcare for
everyone through medicare for all to
fight for a $15 minimum wage to build
our infrastructure that what is urgent
for America in the 21st century is to
rebuild communities and to rebuild this
country so that everyone has an economic
shot so I think that the two are
actually linked in terms of foreign
policy and economic policy when you talk
about foreign policy abstractly and say
Saudi Arabia Yemen Iran people may glaze
over but when you put it in terms that
trillions of dollars are going overseas
and conflicts we can't win and that
money should be helping their kids have
a better economic future I think people
get it when it comes to some of the
specific elections I got a bunch of
questions from people in the audience
that they wanted me to ask her one is
you ultimately supported Alexandria
Ocasio Cortes in New York but after
initially supporting Joe Crowley some
folks want to know what made you
initially support Crowley well you know
I was part of the Congress and Crowley
had come out for medicare-for-all
and he we had he had invited me to visit
his district in Queens and there was
this brilliant program in Queens that
was helping minority community
population get tech jobs and I got
connected with him and so I knew Joe
Crowley and that's why I supported him
but once I got became more aware of
Alexandria Ocasio Cortes and the
inspiring campaign she was running I
endorsed her and dual endorsed I was the
only member of Congress to do that there
it was at some political risk in
retrospect I wish I had done that right
away but I'm glad that I made that
course correction and I think she's
going to be an exceptional candidate I
also think candidly I got a lot of
feedback on social media about
Alexandria Ocasio Cortes that helped me
be ahead of the curve and see the
extraordinary campaign she was running
and so that's another point that people
do listen to independent media and
social media in making these decisions
if
crowds do win back the house will you
support Nancy Pelosi as Speaker a bunch
of people asked about this here's why I
do two reasons one there's no
progressive alternative
I don't want Steny Hoyer to become
hello everyone it feels weird coming
back from the having a day off yesterday
like I'm trying to get back in the swing
of things
did everybody I hope Steve held it down
okay from what I saw he did so Bravo
Steve we have a full house
mr. Pakman has brought out everyone here
in the show as always Casey here on
Tuesdays with ideology hello Casey hi
how you doing I'm doing fantastic the
sharp gentleman on the far end Jamie
welcome back sir yes thank you for
having me I'm glad to see everybody and
the we are sir and the star of the show
tonight
also the fine-looking gentleman in the
center mr. David Pakman welcome sir
thank you for coming on thanks for
having me
absolutely so tonight yes Casey did you
forget Steve oh you started with Steve
if I did know it was the second show we
ever did actually and I getting used to
the life you know the live streaming it
takes a lot because it's not like
recording we recorded the first couple
episodes that we did and you're able to
go back and you know fill in and fix
whatever you mess up so I'm scrambling
to try to focus on you know what I'm
gonna open up with and I open the show
and I said hello everyone I'm Kyle
Curtis and I've joined by this other guy
and I'm waiting on Steve to break in I'm
waiting oh seem to break in to save me
like obviously I'm dangling here on a
limb and he just sits there like he'll
get it eventually
so tonight we're going to talk about the
death penalty and should be abolished
this is a kind of a I guess roundtable
discussion where I'd like to get
everybody's thoughts I know that they
vary
quite differently between everybody in
this call so I think this is gonna be a
really good kind of back and forth and
getting everybody's ideas out there from
the polls that I put out on Twitter and
YouTube and discord it's widely varied
and a lot more split than I thought it
would be I thought it would be a clear
indicator towards you know being
abolished that was just my prejudice
going in I guess but it turns out it's
it's not that simple
and we're gonna get into that a little
bit later as well but right now I'm
going to allow mr. Patman to say a few
words and let you guys know where you
can find his show it's also in the
description but I want to kind of David
I'm sure everybody watching those who
you are but just for formality sake we
kind of let people know who you are what
you do and why you do what you do yeah
sure I host a progressive talk show it's
on close to 200 radio and TV stations
it's the 11:00 p.m.
weekday Eastern Time show on free speech
TV which is on DirecTV and Dish Network
and then we've got a YouTube channel as
well which now we surpassed about
500,000 subscribers I think we must be
around 525 at this point right now we've
got a podcast and I've been doing it for
four years it's my full-time job it's a
show that has you know a number number
of full-time staffers and that's that's
what I do about five days a week
busy man so we definitely appreciate you
taking the time to come on in and chat
with us a bit and I chose this topic
because I just noticed from watching
your show it's something that you would
come back to on occasion it seemed to be
kind of a I don't know this this is just
my assumption but it seems to be like
maybe a personal thing with you or
something that you're really passionate
about so I thought this might be a good
kind of benchmark start out with is that
the case I mean is the death personal
it's no more personal than than any
other political issue I guess that I
have an opinion about okay cool
so let's do this then let's go down the
the line here and so that everybody is
clear on where we're coming from in this
call and then we'll kind of jump into it
you guys kind of say what your stance is
on it briefly we'll go into it a little
bit deeper just but just so everybody
kind of gets an idea of where you're
coming from we'll start with you KC
where where do you stand on the death
penalty being abolished I think it
should be abolished I'm against the
death penalty okay Steve I don't think
we should abolish it I think it needs to
be fixed but I don't think it should be
abolished okay Jamie yeah as far as our
current justice system exists today I
would absolutely abolish it but if there
was significant reform I would be for it
being implemented in a specific way
interesting that that's that's what I
kind of want to start off with but David
what is your stance on the death penalty
I'm against it and I think we should
abolish it all right so we're kind of
kind of split with Jamie being a kind of
in-between guy there so Jamie let's
let's start at that middle ground then
when you say if it's if it can be
reformed then you would be for keeping
yet what do you mean by that first I
want to say I do everything I can to
avoid being sandwiched between you and
Steve and Here I am again in this exact
same time blending so my whole thing is
you know the short short version of this
is I'm really sick and tired of the
United States giving people exceedingly
long prison sentences for really minor
crimes in comparison to the amount of
time they have to spend in prison so for
example you know Kyle you actually
covered this I want to add homies
episodes where a guy stole fajitas and
ended up with 50 years in a federal
prison so my general idea here and again
I can go into depth later but my general
idea is cap all prison sentences to ten
years and if it seriously needs more
than ten years make the death penalty an
option
primarily for for the purposes of saving
on feeding and housing and clothing a
criminal that has no no intention of
rehabilitating but I think that should
come significantly with a proper
understanding of that being the case
psychiatric you know for through
psychiatric evaluation and again a true
justice system not using the standard we
have set today I make that very clear if
we're gonna do things the way we're
doing them now there's no way we would
be capable of insuring somebody's
innocence or guilt we just do a horrible
job of that so yeah I take that approach
that I would trade having the death
sentence for knowing that no prison
sentence would be more than 10 years let
these people get back on with their
lives and weary incorporated into
society interesting I David you seem to
get a little rod up there that's one of
the most nonsensical points of view I've
maybe ever heard on this issue and I've
done a lot of debates about this is it
okay if I ask a couple questions to try
to figure out a little bit more about
what you mean sure so Jamie the forcible
rape of a child would that be in the
under 10 years or in the death penalty
side well I'm not the person who's
qualified to make that determination
what I'm saying is is if it's determined
that it deserves more than ten years by
people who are qualified then it would
be a death sentence so if I understand
correctly you're saying like the current
way it's set up is you're not okay with
you cannot you cannot do it that's why I
say it would need massive amounts of
reform what I'm saying is if somebody
says you're gonna get three consecutive
you know life sentences or you know
three you know that kind of stuff it's
like what are we doing here I mean
there's there's no okay I got you
understand but here's what I'm trying to
figure so you've made it clear that the
current system is set up by the people
who are in charge is not okay but then
when I asked you for your view on a
specific case you said that's for the
people who set it up to decide but you
said that those are the people that are
doing it wrong right so if you if you
have know if you're not going to give an
example of like that
that you can give us a sort of your view
on if you want to okay who are in charge
the review but you're against how
they've done it now so why would you
think that they would do it the right
way next time because I would implement
more there would be more involved in the
process than we have right now that's
why I said like right now there is no
psychiatric evaluation done to determine
the the success or failure of possible
rehabilitation it's done through the
prison system it's not done what do you
what do you mean so in so but the prison
system doesn't determine the sentence so
you want psychiatric evaluation right in
the prison system
it's the justice system that determines
the sentence when someone is found
guilty so why would the prison system
having psychiatrists have any bearing on
the penalty that's assigned at verdict
you didn't hear what I said
the psychiatrist would be during this
you know during the pre-sentencing
really part of the justice system they
have that already that it's false to say
that that doesn't exist now it's used as
part of sentence in countless cases not
in terms of potential for rehabilitation
no absolutely that's a question that's
asked all the time there of
psychiatrists at sentencing okay well
I've never seen it myself okay I mean
this is this actually your hostility
here is a little little high for this
topic it's just like it's such a and I
it requires a significant amount of
maturity to talk about the issues openly
I mean I I'm not I'm not at all
advocating this on a political platform
not running for office on this position
I'm just discussing it in the set one of
the things we have that's a major
problem in our country is significantly
long prison sentences that are unfair
and burdensome and we also have a issuer
we do we have to provide for these long
sentences so what I'm saying is and then
you also get to the deterrence factor
you know you know I haven't seen that's
been completely squash that's having a
death penalty does not provide any
deterrence benefit whatsoever I'm not
saying it's the significant amount just
saying that as it isn't a clear-cut yes
or no case so I'm just saying if we
lived in a society clear-cut it
you think I will share your view I'd
love to hear it yes what's your son
what's your solution David my solution
is we abolish the death penalty
okay just like sorry and have just like
um however long they're sentenced for or
life sentences but note just basically
the system we have now just no death
penalty well no they're definitely I
mean I agree that we have way too long
prison sentences for some crimes like
absolutely for sure the war on drugs is
a disaster that's a hundred percent but
I see that as totally separate from the
death penalty so I feel like the
whatever point of view one has
politically there is a good reason that
should appeal to that point of view to
get rid of the death penalty so like one
of the things that was mentioned was the
cost right the cost of keeping people in
prison for life that's actually cheaper
than the death penalty because since we
get it wrong on the death penalty
unfortunately too often people get
appeals right and that's just something
that our justice system affords even if
you've not been sentenced to death you
still have the opportunity of appeal few
people want to eliminate that as
something that is part of our justice
system as a result of those appeals and
the backlog of death row inmates and
states that have the death penalty and
the lack of availability of the drugs
that will work in a what's called not
cruel and and not inhumane way it costs
more actually for the death penalty than
to just say we're putting someone in
prison without the possibility of parole
particularly because those parole
hearings also incur a cost so like if
your big thing is cost you should get
rid of the death penalty if your big
thing is for some crimes that are so
heinous we want the the worst possible
punishment for someone putting someone
to death and just turning out the lights
doesn't even really seem like the worst
punishment the worst punishment to me
seems the rest of your life all you see
is the inside of that prison cell so
like if your priority is and this it's
not
but if someone had the priority of I
want the worst possible punishment it's
not just ending it it's making someone
live with the reality that they
committed a terrible crime and now
they've got to sit and rot in a cell for
the rest of their lives so these are
just a couple examples I won't go on but
but my point is whatever your political
beliefs are if you have a more
libertarian point of view where you
think that the government should have as
little power as possible because you
don't think the government is good at
doing stuff well then that includes you
don't think the government is good at
figuring out who's innocent and guilty
and you don't want to give the
government the ultimate power of ending
people's lives so I think that's the
sort of main point whatever politics
appeal to any individual there are
really good reasons to be against the
death penalty and to speak to your point
I did I've got I put together a list of
some some facts going towards why it
makes sense to abolish the the death
penalty and one of those things that you
kind of spoke to will take California
for example is it they have the largest
death row in the country and they've
spent over 4 billion on the death
penalty since 1978 while carrying out
only 13 executions so in the in you know
that length of time they've spent 4
billion dollars on executing 13
individuals and that that to me that was
the one of the things that they struck
out to me first hand we're gonna get
into the the the cost of maybe making a
mistake and you know putting someone to
death it's innocent I've got those
statistics on too but let's start out
with with the cost thing Steve you you
came out at the beginning and said that
you wouldn't want to abolish it what's
your mind frame for that what's your
mindset yeah there's a couple there's a
couple points to be brought up one when
you're talking about the cost the most
cost her because of appeal process and
if this goes back to what Jamie's saying
of how we need every man three vamp the
whole system the system is flawed and
Dave I think make some wonderful points
when it comes to do we give the
empowerment to a specific group people
to make these decisions and from a focal
framework we can make those decisions
all the time we always have people that
make those decisions for us
doctors make the decisions of life and
death all the time so if there was a way
that Jemmy is saying by which we can
have some kind of accountability here
for what would be something that would
be determined to be death the death
penalty I'm okay with that but I think
the question that people are missing is
what form of Justice are we trying to
achieve here you have read you'd have
retributive justice you have restorative
justice distributive distributive
justice procedural justice what is the
goal that we're trying to get out of the
death penalty and I think that before we
even try to answer the questions if she
should abolish it or not as which one
are we looking at because I don't agree
for retribution we should have the death
penalty I know David had talked about
this on a video that he'd says that we
should not have the death penalty as
some type of retribution I agree I don't
think it's a very effective means for
retribution
but what about some of the other means
by which we would say this would be an
appropriate type of situation for the
fairness of society that given that most
of us are not committing these heinous
crimes this person did maybe under more
procedural type of justice or I hate to
say restorative because nothing's better
you can't bring back the life of a
person right we can say if I stole from
jammy restrictive lies sort of ways I
could be told I have to be more fun well
I don't know I'd see which retribution
or retributive justice is punitive and I
don't think that's a very effective
means by which we can address the topic
of the death penalty odd but I think
Jimmy has a point it just requires a lot
more sussing out than I think what kick
here to get into in a you know to our
hang out like this right yeah and if I
can before I like yeah I'm just gonna
clarify I don't my point
I don't ever think that it definitely
should be used for the purposes of an
ultimate you know retribution or
punishment in and I do well that's the
part of that 10-year prison thing is if
there's your ten years for appeal now I
get that my ten years is very just
thrown out there and put a dart on the
wall but it's just to get the
conversation going
well yeah thank you Steve for
recognizing that it needs to be
thoroughly thrush doubt not not not
simple
and I'm only David responded but before
I do Steve what is your view as someone
that doesn't think that we should watch
it completely what it what do you think
the the best course of Justice should be
in you know right we should be very
limited well should be very limited in
scope I think that it's showing be for
the worst heinous crimes but it should
be for the protection of society if I
know that Jamie is a sillier serial
killer and he's been executed there's
zero probability of him ever going out
and killing another person that's an
effective means by which to protect in
society that's the only reason why I
would say we would need the death
penalty because people have gone to jail
and they still commit murder
they still do crimes right I mean even
in the jail system so if you want to
protect society from somebody who does
not have these things like compassion or
empathy or even where we will consider
because a soul per se which I don't
believe in but we think that a like a
sociopath we'd say they don't they're
soulless right they don't care they have
no empathy toward anybody if that is a
person that exists then I have no
problem by saying we as a society can
end their life if it's beneficial to the
rest of the society ok David who gets to
determine if it's beneficial to the rest
of society
the people we put in charge for that
same or if we do with doctors there have
to be very stringent rules by which we
have these types of decisions being made
it wouldn't be your average smoker deli
obviously there's somebody that'd be
well-rounded allergy I'm not sure I
understand the analogy to doctors
because you mentioned that a couple
times maybe we could explore that a
little bit I mean I think you know
number one criminals don't choose to put
the justice system in charge of deciding
whether they get the death penalty or
get life in prison for example people
are consenting to have doctors treat
them right so that's that's kind of like
part of the it's part of the way
medicine works I guess we can come up
with some like very specific situations
where someone is brought into an
emergency room and they're
non-responsive and the doctor is sort of
deciding that it's an emergency room
we're going to treat someone but for the
the audience frequently will write in or
ask me questions or call in and talk
about Canadian psychology professor
Jordan Peterson and I've answered a lot
of those specific questions about claims
that he's made about contradictions or
double standards that he's espoused
we've also interviewed Jordan Peterson
on the show it was back in 2017 and I've
expressed some of what I think about
Peterson and about what he does but in
this video I want to go deeper and sort
of flesh out some of the more general
thoughts I have about the movement
surrounding Peterson he's seen as
relevant in some online spheres of
political discussion so I think it's a
good opportunity to go through some of
this stuff and really think about it so
as far as some of Peterson's actual
positions again I've refuted some of
those in the past and I'll probably do
that in the future as it comes up
whether it's some of his confusion about
post-modernism or undervaluing the
utility of collectivism or how he plays
these epistemological games when it
comes to religion and I definitely
disagree with him about many specific
social and political issues and I'm sure
that I'm gonna get some comments after
this video where people will say David
you didn't actually debunk Peterson's
political positions or his
socio-cultural positions or his actual
views on specific issues here you're not
really refuting what he says that's not
the point of this video okay in this
video we're going to talk about Jordan
Peterson himself and his movement and
some generally concerning and
hypocritical elements of it and to start
with it's really important to understand
that Peterson denies being a
right-winger even though he constantly
denounces collectivism egalitarianism
political correctness identity politics
feminism all of which are typically
associated with leftism he's a big
proponent of right-wing and conservative
ideals like hierarchies traditionalism
individualism capitalism and that's fine
right I mean Jordan Peterson can be a
conservative political pundit but he
won't take all
of it now maybe he thinks that he can be
more effective at pushing this ideology
or agenda if he's able to avoid being
labeled as someone who's merely on the
right I don't know that's a possibility
but what's especially silly is
Peterson's complaints about being
thought of as a political figure at all
right he accuses people like many
journalists of unfairly associating him
with politics and of framing him as a
political commentator and framing his
messages as political and that it's the
fault of the journalists that that's
happening you never really thought of
yourself as a political author and and
public figure but that is how and as
I've been saying you know as we've seen
so much of your messages about is the
personal it's how you as an individual
can behave and take responsibility but
yet you are being painted in a political
light do you see yourself as a political
figure
not particularly no but it everyone that
I'm interviewed by virtually insists
that that's what I am right well but the
reason for that is that most of our
dialogue in mainstream media I would say
is always focused on political issues
and so if you have a hammer then
everything looks like a nail right it's
so nice to see people concentrating on
psychological and philosophical issues
and leaving the idiot politics as far
behind as possible because it's
certainly uh what would you call it a
distraction and a dangerous one at that
so it's so funny talking to the
mainstream media types because
everything they talk about has to be
viewed through a political lens and
although I continue to insist I did BBC
HARDtalk which was aired today and that
was a classic example of an interviewer
being entirely scripted and trying to
push everything that's happening around
me I suppose
into a political narrative Peterson has
this attitude of political what humi
political like he's not involved in the
realm of politics and that this is how
people are wrongly or unfairly trying to
paint him now I can think of a ton of
non-political public figures who go on
news Pro
and aren't asked political questions and
don't answer political questions because
they genuinely don't have anything to do
with politics
that's not Jordan Peterson right
individualism versus collectivism that's
a focal point of Peterson's commentary
and it's also one of the foundations of
politics and of people's existence in
one place or another of the political
spectrum and then even more explicitly
Peterson discusses hot-button political
issues like Canadian human rights law
American presidents Canadian Prime
Minister's immigration policy climate
change economics Marxism in equality
including wealth inequality the
relationship between poverty and crime
and on and on and on and he does it on
public popular platforms like his own
YouTube channel on Joe Rogan's podcast
in interviews with journalists in
corporate media so it's absurd for him
to claim to be bothered by people
associating him with politics or people
discussing the political implications of
what he espouses and then more
importantly discussing politics is what
made the guy famous in the first place
right why is he even so popular first of
all he's very effective at tapping into
the anti social justice warrior thinking
that's happening in the minds of many
young people whether these young people
were previously on the right or on the
left or just people who didn't really
think too much about politics they were
to some degree annoyed by perceived
political correctness on their college
campus or on social media Peterson has
regularly uploaded videos to YouTube
since 2013 but he really grew in terms
of the size of his following when he
became this outspoken aunt is JW
activist political activist I would
argue in late 2016 early 2017 around the
issue of transgender pronouns if it
weren't for that vocal opposition to
transgender pronouns two years ago he
likely wouldn't have the following that
he now has it's all predicated upon this
political issue on which he commented
and there's a huge market for that right
now it is much easier as I've talked
about before to become popular and to
make money online if you're doing this
anteye sjw anti political correctness
content than it is creating any other
type of content in the sphere of
politics and social criticism especially
on YouTube which is where Peterson
became prominent I shouldn't say this
but I'm going to because it's just so
goddamn funny I can't help but say that
I figured out how to monetize social
justice warriors it's so funny I just
can't believe it either way but Peterson
is also popular because he gives advice
about personal development that's often
quite good he talks about alienation he
talks about how to find meaning in life
and some of Peterson's critics on the
left I I believe strongly should just
admit that Peterson is talking about
serious issues and he's communicating
real practical ideas that can help
people but it's really important to be
able to distinguish his competence as a
psychologist from his ideologies that
are very wrapped up in politics just
because Peterson offers possible
solutions to common dilemmas that a lot
of young people particularly young men
face when they enter adulthood and when
they try to find their place in the
world that doesn't mean that by default
everything Jordan Peterson says about
politics or philosophy has to be true
the ideologies that make up Peterson's
worldview like Jungian psychology and
fervent individualism are not the only
ideologies that can inform most of the
advice that Peterson gives so what
happens in practice is that Peterson
fans will start taking his reasonable
advice it understandably has a positive
impact on I would say they're probably
his life or sense of self-worth as the
disproportionately men that follow
Peterson which is fine but then he makes
the fallacious assumption that what
Peterson is telling him to do is
inseparably tied to Peterson's
philosophical and political outlook
Peterson's fans will often assume that
because the advice about finding your
place in the world is good and useful
because Peterson's personal worldview on
those issues is true that the politics
of Peterson are the only possible cattle
of that advice and of that ideology in
reality Peterson's giving universal
non-controversial advice which is
espoused and accepted by many world
views often world views that are in
direct conflict with Peterson's politics
helping people improve their personal
well-being for lack of a better term
their self-esteem or their interpersonal
relationships some might argue this is
the point of being a clinical
psychologist which is Peterson's
profession there are many clinical
psychologists who could start YouTube
channels and build a following and help
lots of people even if you want to argue
that Peterson is better suited for it
that he's exceptionally good at
communicating some of these ideas to
young people even if that's true it
still isn't proof that his ideological
perspective is more valid than any of
many other countless other frameworks in
psychology and philosophy that can
result in positive outcomes for people
that are tied to totally different
political ideologies there are totally
different schools of thought that have
done lots of good for people and are
backed up by decades of academic
justification but if Jordan Peterson's
lectures and his views on psychology
resonate with you and help you I don't
want to discount that what I want to do
is remind you that Peterson is not the
only game in town and we should be
careful about thinking of him number one
of some kind of omniscient guru but
number two about thinking of him as
someone who is able to give this non
controversial fairly obvious advice
because of his views on politics
including individualism a Galit arianism
collectivism so on and so forth and you
can tell that this thinking exists in
part from the anger and the
condescension with which Peterson fans
argue against anybody who criticizes him
I've experienced this right some
criticisms of Peterson are unfair and
people should push back against unfair
criticisms of Jordan Peterson it's good
to have reasonable debate about public
figures but the level of passion and
dedication that you
in the Petersons fans on social media
scares me because of how it extends
beyond the rational to the totally
emotionally irrational consider this
question why isn't there an astronomer
or a computer scientist or a historian
with a fan base that will fight to the
death for their claims the way many of
Peterson's fans do for him it is because
many peterson fans have this sort of
deep tribal even spiritual connection to
the guy and his movement in his
teachings and the intensity of
Peterson's defenders goes beyond the
so-called facts and it goes into
feelings and into emotion and into
loyalty that extends beyond reason what
the peterson fans need to understand is
that this type of devotion is partly
what fuels the unfair criticisms of
peterson it's a circle when a public
person has a huge group of zealous
attack dogs who pounce on any critic of
the movement the movement becomes more
fun and attractive to criticise to
outsiders now I'm not saying it should
be that way but without question this
kind of cringy fanboy behavior of so
many peterson fans is itself what turns
people off of jordan peterson people
shouldn't
strawman peterson people shouldn't
criticize peterson dishonestly but the
adoration of his fans is part of what
feeds it and you might say oh that's
unfair and I'm agreeing with you I'm
saying yeah that is unfair but there are
many peterson fans who would benefit
from being a little bit more self-aware
one of the most disconcerting things
about peterson fans is how seriously
they take themselves something that
open-minded people with a sort of
healthy diversity of intellectual
influences rarely do they rarely take
themselves so seriously most people
actually learn to become embarrassed
about taking themselves so seriously and
they eventually grow out of it which may
be some peterson fans will do so to be
clear I'm not saying Peterson's doing
anything to proactively encourage his
fans to act this way
I've seen videos of people asking
Peterson what he thinks of the idea that
he's becoming a sort of cult leader and
his explanations of why he doesn't fit
the definition do make sense
I'm talking about the fans themselves
and their cohesion and their
aggressiveness and groupthink
that's what we should really be paying
attention to so I said it I said I said
the word cult let's talk about that a
little bit strictly speaking it's not
accurate it's not productive to say that
the Petersons movement is a cult per se
but if you're a Peterson fan and
Peterson was your introduction to
philosophy or to psychology or to
self-improvement and you know far more
about Jordan Peterson that about any
other public intellectual or similar
figure it would be useful to examine
that and to sort of broaden your
horizons but this is predictably
understandable in a way Peterson's
following is largely young men going
through the same things that young
adults have gone through for a very long
time existential crisis the need for a
moral code strategies for dealing with
daily life and relationships and anxiety
and sort of finding purpose and your
place in the world these are natural
voids that surfaced when we become
adults and we realize that we're
responsible for our own actions and for
our way of life and we've got to make
sense of it all right but we should be
really cautious about filling those
voids totally or mostly with one
person's advice that's always a bad idea
because we can become sheep and accept
everything that that person says without
skepticism or without enough skepticism
and then you end up in this position of
many Peters and followers which is that
you think anybody who criticizes that
one person must be an idiot and must be
attacked on social media the way we're
seeing critics of Peterson attacks
here's a key point
many jordan peterson fans don't realize
that the good advice they're getting
from Peterson and the positive outcomes
that they might experience by applying
his advice to their lives aren't the
products of Peterson's way of looking at
the world a lot of what Peterson touts
is universal and you can arrive at the
exact same conclusions and ideas through
many paths Peterson's values are one way
of framing it his fans receive this
universally applicable set of truisms
and very obvious advice
package
within Peterson's philosophical and
political views about post-modernism and
feminism and political correctness and
his fans end up thinking that the advice
they get from Peterson is inextricably
linked to those views when it's not
Marxism and political correctness are
bad and individualism is good and Carl
Jung was a genius and mythology is
important therefore I should clean my
room and stand up straight and not tell
lies and make friends with people who
want the best for me
that is the key distortion of this
entire movement Peterson ties the advice
into his ideology either deliberately or
implicitly but most of the advice that
he dispenses is not controversial it's
not unique it's not novel and when
people find the advice powerful and
useful they adopt the rest of his
ideology or they assume that since
Peterson was right about standing up
straight he must be right about
everything else for many of the Peterson
fans that I've spoken to personally it's
a matter of thinking I'm lost in life so
I'm going to go with the self-help guru
that seems to share my belief about how
lame social justice warriors are or Wow
okay look he's got a lot of great advice
on his YouTube channel I'm enjoying it
he clicks with me in a way that no other
intellectual has so I'm hooked into the
entire political milieu that he's
espousing it would be really useful for
the Peterson fans to ask themselves why
are they infatuated with this one person
and not with any of the other
psychologists doing great important
scientific work is it actually the
content of what Peterson is saying or is
it that they're sort of mesmerized by
his YouTube videos and is delivery when
it's the latter this is not his capacity
as an academic
it's his role as a de facto spiritual
leader that is impressing people and
that's where it goes in the cult-like
direction so there's an irony when
Peterson talks about the importance of
thinking for yourself Peterson gives
fans a way of feeling smart without
actually having to thoroughly study the
intellectuals that Peters
sites much less the countless
philosophers with viewpoints that
directly contradict Peterson in really
credible and important ways being a
loyal unquestioning Peterson fan doesn't
really demand much of you right it's
easy many in Peterson's audience are
relying on his interpretations and his
conclusions about philosophical issues
and current events without doing much
thinking on their own and that's what
gurus do and enable their followers to
do
Peterson's fans like to claim that he
uses cold scientific facts to back up
his arguments Peterson presents his
arguments about gender culture economics
politics whatever as hey facts are facts
science has already decided and the
Peterson fans get hypnotized by this and
they develop this attitude that anybody
who disagrees with Peterson's
conclusions and theories must just be
inherently arguing against reason or be
afraid of science or not care about what
the so-called facts are without actually
verifying the cited facts and the
theories outside of Peterson's own
singular word when you combine that with
Peterson's traditionalist moral outrage
which constantly says in in sort of
summary our society is heading in a
dangerous direction and I'm fed up with
it it has the ability as it has done to
mobilize people who feel disenfranchised
by scaring them about a society that's
supposedly changing for the worse and
then it creates this common monolithic
enemy for the Nazis it was the Jews for
Trump voters it was Mexicans and the
Chinese and liberals I guess who knows
for Petersons fans it's this radical
leftist postmodernist neo-marxist figure
which as is often pointed out is really
a concept that Peterson has crudely put
together incorrectly by conflating all
of those movements but that's actually
for another video not for this one but
the main idea is that tribalism becomes
their source of energy banding together
not only against the supposed
postmodernist neo-marxists but against
okay a lot of people have been waiting
for this one I did reappear on the Jesse
Lee Peterson show in person this was
actually his TV only version TV only
show called the fallen state not the
Jesse Lee Peterson radio show of which
I've been kicked off before and it was a
very interesting appearance and I think
people who follow me understand that the
attitude I took was this entire thing is
really not super serious and it was sort
of I took a I took a distant approach in
that my priority was not to get too
worked up by the things that Jesse Lee
Peterson said most of which made
absolutely no sense
there's also we're gonna keep in the
edit before they went live for some
reason the camera cut to us just
awkwardly sitting on the stage and it
went out on air during his live stream
and then his intro started and it is a
very very awkward moment this is the
entire thing uncut my interview on the
fallen state with Jesse Lee Peterson we
are amazing
welcome to to the Father State YouTube
live I'm Justin E Peterson apologize for
the late start but we are black and
black people are late we start on CP
time
it is midterm election season and I have
with me David Pakman he is the
progressive host of the political
television radio program the David
Pakman show
David thank you for coming I can't
believe I'm here I know it's amazing
last time we didn't end well I remember
right do you remember I remember I had
to kick you off my show you kicked me
off you said I never have that idiot
back on my show you call me a girlie man
yeah what changed your mind about having
me back after the ban that's really my
producer oh you didn't even want me here
no I want you you oh you did I told you
I I'm glad you're here oh just because I
fight with you doesn't mean I don't love
you okay yeah you love me I don't really
know you do you have to know me to love
me I
have a general love for all people but I
don't know you but do you need to know
me to love me not as a human now why not
and I'm saying I don't need to know you
to all of you it's part of the human
race yeah well I love you thank you
are you surprised not really were you
surprised it after we off to radio show
not really
and you didn't seem pleased with my
answers oh you were not answering that's
what it was was ask you a question I
will ask you where you're going you tell
me where you've been and so you can't
really do bring forth a good show that
way but sometimes you will admit a
question can be sort of it's like when
did you stop beating your wife right
like not every question is fair I don't
maybe well maybe you beat your wife I
don't know but and that would be an
example beat your wife I'm not married
oh yeah well wait until you get mad okay
Oh
so David what what I wanted to talk to
you about I want to talk about politics
I want to get to know you a little
better let's do it and so my first point
are you a Christian no you know do you
believe in God I don't are you an
atheist I I have an absence of belief in
God if you want to call that atheism it
could be agnosticism I'm not really sure
but I have an absence of belief in God
but it's not like I'm not going around
telling people God doesn't exist it's
sort of like if we heard a noise in the
back right now
I wouldn't say to you that was probably
an invisible purple hippopotamus I have
no evidence that that's what it is I
would say it's probably a noise caused
by something we've seen something we can
prove something there's evidence for I
wouldn't tell you
invisible purpose purple hippopotamuses
don't exist or could never exist right I
just have no reason to think that that's
what caused the noise have you always
not believing that have you ever
believed you know when I was younger so
culturally and ethnically I'm Jewish so
I was around a lot of Jewish people
growing up so there were Old Testaments
around and I would I would look at them
and you know I was sort of I was kind of
a blank slate in the sense that my
parents never imposed religious beliefs
on me but they also didn't tell me you
shouldn't believe anything it was sort
of open you know I could look at the Old
Testament
listen talk to people so there was a
period you know I'm still open to the
possibility of there being a god and and
I always sort of have been but that's I
don't currently believe that there is
one so I believe everyday you apart
Jewish and part Argentinian well they're
two different things so I was born in
Argentina my family a lot of a lot of
Jews from Eastern Europe before and
after the Holocaust moved out of Eastern
Europe as I'm sure you know Argentina is
one of the places that they went so my
family is is so I'm Jewish right but my
family was in Argentina so like I grew
up speaking Spanish and and in that
sense I'm sort of of Hispanic culture
yeah okay and I know you are progressive
right not a liberal I don't really know
the difference at this corner is there a
difference you know a lot of this stuff
is just semantics I think it's better
you know I could tell you what my views
are on any particular issue but whether
I'm you know progressive or liberal or I
don't know I don't know what we gain
from talking would you consider yourself
progressive I want to see progress so in
that sense but by the dictionary
definition I guess so the problem is
that there might be you might have some
ideas about what is implied by the
political term progressive that maybe I
agree with maybe I don't but I
definitely want to see you know humanity
progress for sure and one of the reasons
I'm concerned about you being a
progressive
is that and he specifically are all
progressive all men men only men only
men progressive women don't concern it's
normal
normal abnormal for women to be
progressive interesting Oh a liberal but
it's abnormal for a man to be a liberal
or progressive it's a sign of being a
beta male I didn't know how real men are
conservative Republicans you know and
strong in nature so I'm concerned if you
a liver or progressive well if I became
conservative would I no longer be beta
you'd become alpha well something to
think about
yeah how did you become a liberal
laughs regret progressive were you
always that way or did something happen
along the way
no interestingly you know I'm glad you
asked that actually in in high school I
took a lot of sort of standard what we
would call ex classical economics and
classical economics is pretty
conservative in a lot of ways you know
it assumes rational actors participating
in the akai is it assumes a lot of stuff
that that's sort of right now more
conservative in terms of economics so I
had a lot of those ideas and I thought
that they made sense and then I learned
more about behavioral economics and the
work of people like Daniel Kahneman and
others who say you know economics as we
usually teach it is is not right and so
that made me question the beliefs that I
had sort of assembled over time and then
I was questioning all of my beliefs so I
definitely have had it sort of a shift
to the left I was never a right winger
yeah I'm not saying that yeah but I've
definitely moved to the left that the
more I've become educated about issues
this is why I'm not there to allow
children to go to public schools mmm
tell me more
because they are brainwashing them and I
didn't go to public school turning them
away from their values I didn't go to
private school - if you don't watch out
for it I'm kidding I did go to hell yeah
do your parents know that just education
system had its impact on you turned you
into a liberal do they know that it had
this impact on you know it's interesting
I mean they know my political views are
you later and are they happy with them
do they're very they're very I don't
know my mom is the happiest Jewish mom
you could imagine so you're not been
married you have you're not married or
never been married no kids and all that
I've never been married that's true I'm
not currently married of course and I
don't have children at this time yeah do
your date I do and do you find that it's
difficult for young men merely your age
group to find good women to date not at
all no no no no the women that you dated
have data are they controlling how do I
do date women exclusively but I'm how
did you know that I date women it's
possible I date men or both right when
area is possible but I wouldn't assume
that about didn't assume that that yeah
I'll let you tell me now you date men to
exclusively women Oh
would it be a bad thing for our
conversation if I dated men I wouldn't
be bad for our conversation would be
interesting okay why don't you date men
I'm not attracted to men oh good I don't
see anything wrong with it but I know
you do you do not see anything wrong
with it with being attracted to men why
not why would it be wrong because it's
of the same sex so is that normal but
that's not an argument it's a fact what
makes something normal let me ask you
this I wanted to ask you this too I
wanted to ask this not my regular self
please if a woman decide that oh you
know I feel like a man and I want to be
a man and she goes to a doctor
rushed out of the road to a doctor's
office yep he take off her female body
parts and attached male body parts to
them well to her would that make her a
male would it make her male uh-huh or
would it make her a man either one
depends how you define either right
right would it make her a man or me a
male would she still be a woman with
body parts of a man I mean it'd be a
transgender man but would it be a woman
would be what make her a man it would be
a transgender man does that mean it
means it's someone who was born
biologically female wouldn't it right
this isn't my area of expertise I'm just
I'm interested although people want you
know right from wrong will you see it
right do I know right from wrong I don't
know do I
you don't know if you know right from
wrong I think people want to know what's
right and what's wrong but does every if
everybody knew right from wrong no bad
things would ever happen right well how
about you do you know right from wrong I
feel like I do and so if you saw if you
knew a female who took off her body
female body parts and attached a male
body parts to them what you think wow
that's a man or would you still know
that's a woman it depends on the person
right I depend how what they look like
and and sort of how they exist how about
a woman that you knew you know very well
yeah David you're not a good friend
today I'm gonna become a man okay I'm
going down to the doctor's office and
have some male body parts or tasks right
would you still think would you state
that your friend is a woman or a man I
mean my reaction would be radical
empathy I would say Oh
that's a major change she's like what
what's going on that's making you want
to do that and I would listen to them
yeah
with empathy well would you know a woman
on what you think it's a man we think
it's gonna be hard to say I mean every
person is different right I'm talking
about you know I mean every other person
every other person I don't know what
they what they would be like what it
would be like to be with them but what
would you think I don't I would still
know that that's a woman right I don't
care how great a male body parties
attack right it's still a woman okay but
what you could fit it might be a man
what do you think of it as a man it what
I think of it as a man right it's a
person right I don't say right it's a
female but would you think of the female
as a man we'd have to meet and see what
it's like you already know you grew up
with it here's the girlfriend right but
this is imaginary would you think it's a
man or woman I have no idea amazing you
don't believe in God where do you get
your values from where do I get my
values yeah culture family science I
wanted to ask you about cap let me first
a do you have anything to ask me any
questions you think you disagree with me
about what I love course we disagree but
like what do you disagree with me about
what do we agree about I don't know that
we agree on anything my wife for example
economics social issues gay marriage I
don't know do we agree about anything
well we don't yeah
so I want to ask you about judge
Cavanaugh okay
when the children of the lie tried to
take his life I'm not familiar with them
the children are allowed at liberal
media the Democratic Party the Rhino
Republicans they're never propers
okay there's no like everybody but Trump
movement those evil women has to have
movement all civil rights leaders all of
us they are children of the lines a lot
of people it is I think have a lot a big
family but when they tried to destroy
him that woman whatever her name is
it won't come to me doesn't matter to
you anyway right I mean yeah when she
lied on him and you saw that the
children of the large fire to destroy
these
here's why Eddie's children okay my
accusing him of being a rapist and all
that calling him a rapist were you
disappointed to see the children of
Allah act in that way so this is one of
those questions where the framing of the
question we have to talk about because
you're assuming that I already believe
she lied but I don't know that she lied
I don't have any evidence that she lied
did you pay attention to here I watched
every minute did you hear anything to
indicate if she was telling the truth
yes right there was no so here's a
couple things I'll tell you what to me
suggested she was telling the truth
number one it was all downside for her
coming forward there was no upside she's
not gonna get any money now because she
made the allegation she's not gonna live
a better life she had to move so first
of all it's sort of like motive there
was no upside to her there was the
chance that maybe it would prevent
Kavanaugh from being confirmed but most
people including me all along were
saying this isn't going to stop his
confirmation so that was one thing that
made me not doubt her that there was
really nothing again the second thing is
during the hearing which was like what
ten hours long it was very very long
like five hours each of them there were
like dozens of questions that Brett
Kavanaugh didn't answer and she answered
every question and when I see that and I
see one person answering every single
question and the other person not
answering so many questions based on my
experience talking to people who
sometimes lie and sometimes tell the
truth I believe that it's more likely
the person not answering the questions
is the person lying amazing yeah so she
was at weird where and how I don't know
where it happened I don't know when it
happened I remember as a beer and then
she developed this little weak little
girl voice is supposed to be a professor
and if you develop this little little
one name let's Christine blatant bored
right so let me see if I knew develop
this forth little girl tone her voice
made you not trust her know her line
made me she had no proof but everybody
mentioned she doesn't remember when
where or how only thing she remember is
a beer that's not until you remembered a
lot of stuff you would have known want
to believe her not to see that he would
lie and plushies now I know mentally off
you know what like the life was all
about nobody was home you're making
assessments of who's mentally off on TV
you think mentally are and that's your
assessment yeah because he was weird she
was weird yeah it's like they went to
the gates of Hell over to Israel
Kavanagh seemed normal to you over in
Israel there is a little old CD now
where the gates of hell is there and
it's a dark pit that if you go down and
you can't return they say and so
whenever I see women like that and men
like that it reminds me men and women
like what like for just wicked lion it's
a woman was willing to destroy this man
because he didn't agree with his
politics she would being used I believe
how she Kara out there I think that I'm
pretty sure she was a she was a
Republican I don't know what politics
can I ask you a question decide I want I
want to understand but what could she
have done during the hearing where you
would have said you know what I do
believe her like what could she have I
know you don't believe her right right
like the way it went down you don't
believe her
what could she have done during the
hearings where you would have said I
believe her if she has she gone Nerdist
saying you know what the children of the
lab trying to use me to destroy Josh
Kavanagh but that would be a lie I see
no reason this man should be destroyed
and so I just want you to know not to
trust the children of the lie so only if
she would can said you would have
thought I would have I want to believe
that oh yeah she brought real evidence
he brought none logo and but that's how
evil the children on the left are they
will destroy you to get what they want
and that's power and well I'm curious if
they're so powerful the children of the
law they're not powerful
oh I think that's what they want I think
we will destroy it they will they will
destroy you they'll try to destroy okay
to get power and do you agree with that
no no really
do you trust the would you want someone
to Boston to accuse you and now you and
the world has to believe the accuser and
not believe you or would you rather be
its
in a sense yeah improving there's two
different things right in our justice
system in our legal system we have
innocence until guilt has improved
there's no question about that what
happened with dr. Christine Blasi Ford
was not it was not part of the justice
system right this was people like you
and me and hundred senators and the
public making an assessment of the
believability of two different people
right so nobody I would say to you
innocence until guilt has been proven is
logical if you're looking at putting
someone in prison but this wasn't a
criminal trial you and you acknowledge
that right that's so ridiculous I don't
know it's just true it's interesting how
when your children are real I know but
saying it's ridiculous is ridiculous
it's not an argument
this man was accused I don't care if it
was an innocent man walking down the
road you don't just accuse people and
whatever reason gonna make up for it
doesn't make sense this woman here
accused this man right what no proof and
the children of the large fire to
destroy him oh come on no proof okay
would you want to be falsely accused
before any reason at all whether for
jobs course not right
you want any and if someone should
accuse you yeah when you want to hear to
assume you in if you're innocent I would
[Music]
the david pakman show at david
pakman.com so after multiple denials the
New York Times and CNN are both
reporting now that Saudi Arabia is going
to admit that yes journalist for The
Washington Post
American resident Jamal shogi did die at
their Embassy in Istanbul Turkey and the
implications are very far-reaching to
say the least we talked yesterday about
the story and we talked yesterday only
about what we knew at that time which
was that although everything pointed to
Saudi Arabia having a hand in and likely
being responsible for the death of the
journalists they had vehemently denied
it multiple times including reportedly
to Donald Trump and we spoke about the
geopolitical implications we talked
about the economic implications and a
lot more and at this point on the facts
nobody should be surprised that
Khashoggi died in Saudi custody or at
the hands of the Saudis that's been
pretty obvious for days and the way
specifically that Saudi Arabia according
to the reporting we have right now from
the New York Times and CNN and this may
change by the time you listen to this or
you watch this
Saudi Arabia is going to frame this as
it was an accidental death due to a
botched interrogation at the Embassy in
Istanbul now there is also visual
evidence of him entering that embassy in
Istanbul which we are we have on the
screen behind me for our television and
video audience and as a reminder before
we get to sort of the full explanation
that we're anticipating from the Saudis
yesterday I played video for you of
Donald Trump proposing really in a way
that provided cover for the Saudis that
it could have been random rogue killers
amorphous nameless unknown rogue killers
who took the journalists out here
just a reminder of what Trump said
yesterday with that being said the King
firmly denied any knowledge of it he
didn't really know maybe
I don't want to get into his mind but it
sounded to me like maybe these could
have been Rogen killers who knows we're
gonna try getting to the bottom of it
very soon but his was a flat denial
yeah so did Donald Trump say this
sincerely when he said it yesterday if
so it would suggest that Saudi Arabia
was directly lying to Trump personally
and we would hope that that would have
repercussions but we'll get to that
Saudi Arabia initially again saying they
know nothing about it
had nothing to do with it despite
information from very early on that one
of the few places that khashoggi went
when he was in Istanbul was to the Saudi
embassy there and specific information
suggesting he was not only murdered but
also dismembered there new explanation
is reportedly again as I mentioned and
alluded to this was an interrogation
that they were doing of Jamal shogi but
the interrogation went wrong and he
ended up dead and as the details come
out the story gets even more bizarre
Turkish officials are claiming and
believe me I know that when the Turkish
officials claim something we have to be
cautious and skeptical Turkish officials
say that a Saudi autopsy specialist
entered the country carrying a bone saw
in a group of 15 Saudis who came into
Turkey the day that Khashoggi
disappeared this has all the markings of
and appears to be yet another
disgustingly brutal and atrocious act by
the Saudis and what is you know we often
say 50 people shot in Chicago over the
weekend but it's this one person that
got shot in South Carolina that makes
the news or 10,000 kids died of hunger
in Africa yesterday but the two that
died on the London subway make the news
consider how many people in Yemen have
died at the hands of Saudi Arabia over
the last year that doesn't mean that the
khashoggi story is an on story but it is
part it's always a media story as well
what makes the news the interrogation
gone wrong explanation that could be
right it could be it's very interesting
though like was he threatened with a
bone saw and wouldn't cooperate that
with them so he ended up getting
dismembered we have to know the details
about this was the bone saw brought in
after he had already died in order to
you literally take him apart I mean it's
 it's gruesome what we're talking
about here and it's also important to
understand that if Trump didn't come up
with the rogue killers theory himself
and he was really told that by the Saudi
royal family this means they're straight
up lying to the president which would
hopefully carry some diplomatic
repercussions but in the era of trumpet
it's not it's not clear that it will
rogue killers is sort of accurate in
that it's this the Saudis behave like
rogue killers right and in that sense it
is sort of accurate but beyond that I
think we know that it that that was not
an accurate assessment and the real
problem is that we seem to have this
dictator believing dictator friendly
White House right now and it is a story
about Saudi Arabia but as an American
show this is also a story about our
relationship with this brutal regime the
story from Saudi Arabia was never
believable right embassies are very
secure there are cameras everywhere
there are visitor logs and security
checks the idea that Jamal khashoggi had
been at the Embassy and two weeks later
the Saudi royal family still just didn't
know they weren't sure or they hadn't
heard that he had been at the embassy
was laughable from the beginning the
only question is have they been straight
up lying the entire time and do we
believe that it was an interrogation
gone wrong and I think you're right Pat
that it could have been but it's also
just as likely if not more likely that
it was an interrogation followed by a
deliberate execution and they're calling
it an interrogation gone wrong because
we'll never really know and even if the
Saudis did lie to Trump it's clear that
he's not going to do anything about it
you know things said during the 60
Minutes interview that he wasn't
considering sanctions and that there are
other ways supposedly to punish Saudi
Arabia over this but he also made it
clear that he wants to keep that 110
billion dollar arms deal and for him the
life of this one journalist just isn't
worth that money well this is important
because this is it is one journalist it
is one life that appears to have been
brutally ended early it's an American
resident it's a journalist working for
The Washington Post the idea that we
would accept as a reasonable explanation
that you know it was an interrogation
and the Saudis miscalculated and he
ended up dead whether it's true or not
is irrelevant because it's not an actual
explanation that would say to us
oh well no repercussions are warranted
the repercussions here are ones that
we've been calling for for a very long
time if it's this that causes that to
happen great it may just expose the
degree to which Trump is just enamored
and complicit with brutal authoritarians
all over the world I genuinely don't
know what the follow-up will be but you
can be sure that we are going to be
covering covering it
it appears that Robert Muller is at
least initially going to question Donald
Trump in the Russia investigation in
writing
meaning that trumps lawyers will be
allowed to write totally innocuous
probably non perjury answers to
questions from Robert Muller if this is
all that is going to take place as far
as the questioning of Trump it's a total
disaster so this is according to sources
that are directly involved with the
process they told CBS News that this is
going on importantly we don't know
whether this is it for Trump's
involvement or if this is just step one
when CNN first reported it one of trumps
lawyers Jay Sekulow said no comment and
CNN said we don't know whether this is
the first of multiple rounds of
questions or if there's the possibility
of asking follow-up questions or if it
will culminate in an in-person interview
we just didn't know and it's been a huge
topic of contention for months now we
know that this rotating cast of lawyers
that Donald Trump has has been trying to
avoid Trump sitting down in person with
Robert Muller period and we knew that
they wanted written questions and
answers and at least based on the
current reporting there will be a round
of questions and answers in writing but
we don't know if this is a precursor to
the real interview or not Rudy Giuliani
says we are not prepared to agree to
more questions until this first group of
questions is asked answered and someone
can explain why that isn't enough
reasons why only written questions are
not sufficient includes that sort of
like what the FBI investigation of Brett
Kavanaugh was not sufficient because it
didn't even
include questions to Cavanaugh there is
no opportunity to explore whether Trump
is telling the whole truth if you just
do written questions write that phrase
the truth the whole truth and nothing
but the truth it's easier to enforce
that when you can follow up with the
person and they're sitting right in
front of you because Trump's lawyers
will likely stick to the truth in their
answers but they're not gonna volunteer
the whole truth and this is one of those
cases where the whole truth is really
where Trump could get messed up and end
up exposing the obstruction the lies the
possible criminality and the most
pressing question is why would Muller
allow this and there's a few
possibilities
number one if Robert Muller starts to
think he's not going to be able to get
an in-person interview that if he has to
subpoena Trump that the subpoena would
be ignored or challenged then maybe you
say is Robert Muller if this is all I
can get I will do some written questions
that's one possibility the more sort of
clever or devious explanation would be
maybe Muller is so well prepared that
he's hoping to get some lives or
contradictions in writing from Trump's
lawyers because they may not know what
Muller already has and getting lies in
writing would be much more powerful if
they are Trump's sworn statements then
the sort of subjective offhanded
comments that you might get during an
in-person interview but I'm thinking
like super optimistically here yeah I'm
leaning towards that second second
explanation because the Moller
investigation has been going on for well
over a year at this point so you have to
imagine they have quite a bit of
evidence and they know what went down
and you know maybe this is the best they
can get out of Trump because he is a
sitting president and he is so busy yes
of course but tweeting about horse-faced
or me they could definitely catch him in
a lie or a few lies here the truth is
that if Trump did collude with the
Russians or obstruct justice or whatever
else he's probably lying to his lawyers
anyway so you may end up in a situation
where what Trump's lawyers present to
Muller are lies but they are Trump's
lies in other words his own lawyers may
not even
that those are lies and Bob Woodward
actually describes a conversation
between trumps lawyer Jay Sekulow and
the Muller team where Jay Sekulow and
maybe even John Dowd also say we can't
let Trump look like an idiot because the
transcripts will be released other
countries will realize that Trump is a
quote goddamn dumbbell that's a quote
and that type of thing but I actually
don't know that that's really a concern
in the sense that it's a concern that
other the other leaders think Trump is a
dumbbell but they probably already know
that if they've dealt with him I don't
know that transcripts of an interview
with Muller would really it would really
expose that but to go back to Muller for
a second the most interesting theory
I've seen about why Muller would agree
to written answers for now is that he
may not think that he can legally
subpoena Trump successfully now and get
him in the room but if he gets written
answers that directly contradict what
other witnesses have said maybe that
would give him stronger legal
justification for pushing for the
enforcement of a subpoena it's a
hypothesis I would just hope that these
questions are falsifiable right I hope
he's asking did you know about the Trump
Tower meeting ahead of time did you know
that Russia was trying to help and
influence your campaign because yeah
sure lawyers can kind of work their way
around that but in the end those are yes
or no questions and Mulder may already
have an evidence to confirm that those
are things Trump knew or talked about or
met with Dettol at the time what I think
is most likely to happen here is what
happened with Cavanaugh I hate to be
pessimistic but it will be listen he
answered the questions there was nothing
obvious in the questions that justified
mandating or forcing an in-person
meeting and we're gonna have to continue
the investigation just on the basis of
these written answers that's what I
believe is the most likely outcome here
but I do want to hear from you about it

this next story would be sort of dumb
sidebar were it not for the fact that it
goes to the total debasement of American
politics and basic honesty in our
country and it's the story of
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren
who's been attacked for a long time for
claiming Native American heritage in her
family she's been ridiculed for this
Donald Trump has made it a habit of
making fun of her by calling her
Pocahontas many times I could play 15
minutes of examples for you here's just
one right just to give you a sense of
how he does it you'll have plenty of
those Democrats coming over and you're
gonna say no sir no thank you no ma'am
perhaps ma'am it may be Pocahontas
remember that
Donald Trump also previously said that
if Elizabeth Warren took a DNA test and
released it and it showed that she had
Native American ancestry or as Trump
likes to call it that she was an Indian
that he would donate a million dollars
to the charity of her choice and
Elizabeth Warren has done that she's
published her DNA results it seems to be
more about 2022 try to be able to say
listen I've dealt with that issue if she
does indeed want to run for president in
2020 then her about then about her
campaign right now here in Massachusetts
which she's going to handily win and a
Stanford professor Carlos Bustamante
who's an expert in data science and
genomics said that as in genomics our
genomics its genomic think it's genomics
I say genomics said that the vast
majority of Elizabeth Warren's ancestry
is European but that quote the results
strongly support the existence of an
unexpected
somewhere between six and ten
generations ago which critics will point
out ten generations would mean that she
is 1/1000 24th Native American so the
immediate questions were number one why
is Warren doing this now answer again I
think it's about getting it out of the
way if she wants to advance a
presidential run in 2020 interestingly
Donald Trump is not ready to donate the
million Trump was asked about this
yesterday morning and he straight-up
denied ever having made the promise to
donate a million dollars check this out
[Music]
you better read it again now here is
Donald Trump himself making the promise
and tell me Pat if my ears are deceiving
me this is from July 5th where Donald
Trump said exactly what he denied saying
there and we will say I will give you a
million dollars to your favorite charity
paid for by Trump if you take the test
and it shows you're an idiot
yeah shows you're an Indian I like how
the crowd cheers that like what are you
what are you cheering there right well
maybe that's providing him covered right
because turns out she was Native
American partially yes not Indian she's
she is no she's not claiming any Indian
ancestry dating back to the Indian
subcontinent he can argue he was kidding
he can argue it doesn't really show that
she is Native American if she's only one
one thousand twenty-fourth Native
American but how can they argue that he
never said it and while we're at it
didn't Sean Hannity say he'd get
waterboarded if something or other
happened and he didn't do it I think
that that's also a promise that Oliver
just remembered I would like to see that
maybe he could make it longer than
Mancow muller did what was that like
four seconds or seconds waterboarding
torture so the latest is Trump says he
will only donate the million if he can
test Elizabeth Warren himself I don't
even know what that means like he's not
he's not a DNA I don't want to know what
that I don't I don't want to know what
Trump imagines it would mean for him to
personally test Elizabeth Warren's DNA
in any case does anybody find it odd
that if you have a drop of African blood
according to some of these rightists
you're black but if you have a Native
American great-great-great-grandmother
you're not Native American and it's okay
to mock you as Pocahontas and I want to
be like crystal clear here okay if you
are arguing that Elizabeth Warren has
not experienced setbacks in her life on
the basis of being Native American I'm
with you okay I have seen no evidence
whatsoever that whether or not Elizabeth
Warren is 1024 Thor won five hundred and
twelfth or whatever it is Native
American I have seen no evidence
whatsoever that she has suffered
setbacks in her experience in life as a
wealthy sixty something year
woman if I'm wrong show me the evidence
there is no question whatsoever here
that her Native American heritage is
minor it's more than mine I mean I have
none like I have no Native American
Heritage period in my background so she
is more than me but does it relate to
her experience as a person in the United
States of America no I don't think so
but if I had an Italian great-great
great-grandmother would it be okay to
start calling me
Guido sarcastically or whatever right
like if I had an Irish ancestor is it
acceptable for the president to jokingly
mock me as Mick or something that's the
point here which is again the debasement
of the politics and if you want to come
to me and say no David the real problem
here is that Elizabeth Warren actually
received an advantage on the basis of
claiming this Native American heritage
come to me and prove that because I've
not seen that people who say well she
was classified at Harvard as Native
so Donald Trump's ambassador to the
United Nations nikki Haley is resigning
at the end of the year this was
announced yesterday trump and nikki
Haley actually did a press event at the
White House and it was all presented as
everybody's on good terms this is all
very happy
Nikki's great everybody's great but the
truth is that nikki Haley has actually
been pretty critical of Donald Trump
during her tenure as ambassador to the
UN at least compared to some of the
other totally unconscious brown nosers
of Donald Trump and according to what
Trump said yesterday he had known for
six months that nikki Haley wanted a
break after this year and everybody is
just super happy about this is what we
were led to believe but we know that
Haley was sometimes at odds with Trump's
third of three national security
advisers john bolton and this is number
one a decision a change that is likely
going to lead to even more
radicalization and it's not that nikki
Haley was Pro UN in any broad sense of
the term by no means but she is likely
more friendly to the United Nations than
whoever Donald Trump is going to end up
naming as her replacement and yesterday
I did the story about the radicalization
of American institutions and what we're
seeing is that American diplomacy
continues to radicalize when you add as
Trump certainly will a more hostile to
the United Nations ambassador you were
furthering this move to the right this
radicalization of American diplomacy now
as far as what the real the so-called
real plan is here there's a bunch of
different speculation I'll tell you some
of the top hypotheses number one there's
the suggestion that there's gonna be a
really big shake-up in the Trump
administration for 2020 and that nikki
Haley will ultimately run as Trump's
vice president for 2024 the reelection
campaign as his running mate and that
Mike Pence will end up going to the
cabinet right this is this is not what I
think is going to happen necessarily but
this is one idea another idea is that
nikki Haley is being
to run for the Senate in 2020 in South
Carolina and there's actually some
specific details about that I got one
email saying Trump is going to push
chief of staff John Kelly out after the
midterms meaning in December January and
install nikki Haley as chief of staff
which doesn't ring particularly true to
me given that again nikki Haley has been
somewhat critical of some things that
Donald Trump is said and done another
idea would be that the reason for nikki
Haley leaving her UN ambassadorship is
so that Lindsey Graham who's a senator
from South Carolina can be rewarded for
that totally unhinged Brett Kavanaugh
rant at the hearings two weeks ago and
as you an ambassador you then put nikki
Haley in as Senator filling in for
Lindsey Graham for the remainder of his
term and then she runs in 2020 in 2020
Lindsey Graham seat is up for
re-election and you would get her the
power of incumbency by having her in
there for a couple of years and then she
can actually run for that seat properly
as the actual candidate in 2020 but for
me the most interesting possibility has
nothing to do with Trump's plan for
nikki Haley it just so happens Pat I
don't know if you'll be surprised by
this I know many in our audience won't
be that Nikki Haley's resignation
announcement remember she's not actually
leaving till the end of the year came
the day after an ethics watchdog group
requested an investigation into her
flights on private jets the watchdog
group is claiming that she improperly
disclosed I think it's six or seven
flights on private jets on her 2017
financial disclosure a lot of problems
with private jet and first-class jet
travel for Trump people and this is
interesting timing to say the least this
is completely in line with what Tom
Price did and well Steve minuchin did
but it could all just be coincidence I
mean this will be two full years for
nikki Haley as the UN Ambassador yeah
it's not like at the beginning of the
Trump administration when people would
leave after a month or two and we were
wondering why are they leaving so early
I think there are fewer questions with
this one
there are
you were questions but they're still
question and we know that a really good
way to get federal ethics probes to go
away is to resign and now she's not
actually leaving until the end of the
year and how that would play into a
possible ethics investigation is less
clear but Citizens for responsibility
and ethics in Washington has filed a
complaint they want a full investigation
into this they want the Inspector
General to explore these seven flights
on private jets paid for by three South
Carolina businessmen did she resign
yesterday or announced her resignation
yesterday because of this I don't know
what I do know is that it's too easy to
get out of these ethics investigations
by resigning that that's in no other
world are you free to go like if you get
into your car before the police catch
you and say we want to talk to you about
something you say I made it into my car
the police don't say oh you know you did
you're in your car we're not going to
talk to you we're not going to explore
what it is we think you did wrong that's
basically the way it works with federal
officials and these ethics
investigations so anyway which is the
most likely explanation I don't know but
nikki Haley is going bye-bye and there
are important policy implications which
is which relate to the question of how
Trump is going to have a replacement
influence the relationship of the United
States with the UN which to use Trump's
word is an increasingly beleaguered
relationship and this really matters and
lastly let me throw in could Donald
Trump be thinking of replacing nikki
Haley with his own daughter not Tiffany
he seems to camp seems he can't stand
Tiffany at all Ivanka Trump could Ivanka
Trump be Trump's idea of the next
ambassador to the United Nations
he couldn't they wouldn't let him right
well let's talk about that next we have
to talk about something today that is
going to make some of the people in our
audience extremely uncomfortable because
it turns out that Donald Trump
disproportionately appealed to
cognitively challenged voters to vote
is likely to perform poorly on
intellectual ability tests now I want to
issue a disclaimer here because I know I
know what's going to happen Pat we know
what the response will be if you were a
so-called race realist who wants to just
go where the evidence takes us if you're
in the facts don't care about your
feelings crowd if you're against
claiming to be offended to shut down
debate because being offended isn't an
argument I'm glad you're here because
you then must allow the facts to lead
you where they may and they lead down
the path of Trump voter voters being as
a whole less intellectually capable than
Hillary Clinton supporters on a totally
standard test known as a solid indicator
of intellectual ability this doesn't
mean every Trump supporter is dumb this
doesn't mean that some smart people
don't support Donald Trump it just means
that in total in the aggregate Donald
Trump was disproportionately supported
by voters with lesser intellectual
ability and more cognitive challenges
than Hillary Clinton the research team
was led by yo of gonza of tel-aviv
University now if you're a race realist
you should really believe these results
because Jews supposedly are the smart
ones according to the race realists and
we've got a guy from tel aviv university
named you have gonzaque who's going to
give us the results this is the most
credible source of information is how
can you argue against that for the race
real absolutely the study analyzed data
from the American national election
studies report and it points out that
quote intellectual factors played an
important role in the 2016 election
these results suggest that the 2016
presidential election u.s. presidential
election had less to do with party
affiliation income or education and more
to do with basic cognitive ability the
subjects of the study were given a basic
verbal abilities test which is widely
accepted as a pretty good indicator of
overall cognitive ability and the Trump
supporters were under-equipped relative
to Hillary Clinton voters higher verbal
ability education cognitive ability we
associated with supporting Obama over
Romney in 2012 and with Hillary over
Trump in 2016 this is interesting on a
few levels first of all we were told
Trump won because of economic anxiety
the data now show that that was mostly
an empty explanation it wasn't a good
explanation however we do see evidence
that fear of losing social status as
well as racist and sexist beliefs were
positively correlated with support for
Donald Trump we also know that racism
and sexism are affiliated with lack of
intellectual capacity overall that's an
interesting data point we also have
another study unrelated to this one that
points similarly which says the
Democrats who chose to cross party lines
and vote for Trump were
disproportionately the ones who engaged
in lower levels of critical thinking
hello another data point that suggests
that tel-aviv University study that the
Tel Aviv University study is on to
something so I'm ready for the hate mail
David you guys are never gonna win by
insulting Trump voters I'm telling you
this because it's apparently the reality
based on the facts we have the reality
doesn't care about how you feel about
these results what does it tell us about
winning elections though that's really
the question because we know that
playing off of people's basic
fear-driven instincts works really well
we've known that for a while people are
not going to make informed analyses they
are overwhelmingly going to react
instinctively that's not new there's
something called the dunning-kruger
effect I interviewed David Dunning about
it some years ago the dunning-kruger
effect references people who lack the
cognitive ability to understand why they
misunderstand something so the question
is what do we do we know that things are
never as simple as simpletons make them
seem we know that real life is complex
it's mostly great gray area but is that
just a loser's path look at John Kerry
versus George Bush for example I've put
aside the potential irregularities in
Ohio during that election do we play the
game to win I don't know the answer I
really don't know the answer here and I
want to hear from you
out it because I don't know what we had
a call about this last week something
along the lines of should Democrats use
the tactics of the right to win in order
the debt to then actually do a
progressive agenda or are we quote
stooping to their level if we do that
and you know if we don't start winning
things are gonna get way worse so I
think at a certain point from a purely
pragmatic perspective you've got to say
we need to start winning at least using
the tactics that we know work one of the
most prominent Senate races this
November is incumbent extremist vile
disgusting depraved dilapidated I might
even say that makes sense
Texas Republican Ted Cruz against
Democratic challenger better or or we've
been talking about this one it's a tough
one taking out an incumbent Republican
in Texas is an uphill battle but if you
were able to remove such a toxic and
ridiculous Republican it would be a huge
victory it would be an absolutely
massive victory and what we learned
early this morning is that Ted Cruz is
declining to participate in a town hall
debate with Beto O'Rourke on CNN on
October 18th
they have debated already it didn't go
super well for Ted Cruz although it was
a lot of preaching to the choir like I
don't know that mines were necessarily
changed by that first debate I don't
think that baito did all that well
either he just sounded like a typical
politician could have attacked at
different points yeah it was 50/50 I
don't know if it moved the needle but
Ted Cruz is opting not to participate in
this town hall debate his campaign was
asked why he's not participating in this
one they haven't as of this morning
commented and so what that means is that
Beto or work is going to get a one hour
live townhall with voters on CNN and Ted
Cruz simply isn't going to be there now
that may actually help better or work
that might actually make a difference I
will say that Ted Cruz isn't just
avoiding all debate with Beto or Roarke
he already debated with him once there's
another debate scheduled for two days
prior to the Town Hall on October 16th
in San Antonio if Cruz showed up shows
up and as far as we know he is planning
to so there's kind of two major
storylines about why might Ted Cruz
decline an opportunity for now
a one-hour national appearance national
media appearance with his opponent the
right is saying Ted Cruz has no reason
to do this many debates he's killing it
in the race there's a new New York Times
poll which says Cruz's up nine against
Beto O'Rourke 53 to 44 with 3% undecided
which if you believe this thing's
basically over Ted Cruz is gonna win and
be reelected if you believe that you're
up 9 you might just say I don't need to
do two debates in a three days three
days span I just don't need to do that
there's also a level of possible
hypocrisy here because in 2016 Cruz
criticized Trump for canceling a
presidential debate to raise money for
veterans or something like that remember
when Ted Cruz said this Donald Trump has
decided not to participate in the Fox
News debate this upcoming Monday you
were ready to go John Kasich was ready
to go Kasich said he's not going to go
if Trump's not going and your response
to mr. Trump's decision well Megan it's
great to be with you and and for
whatever reason it seems that the Donald
Trump finds you a very very terrifying
person he skipped the debate dial what
cuz you were going to be moderating and
and I guess he doesn't like when anyone
challenges him you know he was saying
just a week ago that he was eager to get
one-on-one with me well this debate that
that the field is narrowed even more and
he could have had a direct debate with
me and yet Donald apparently is ducking
he's afraid of being challenged okay so
we've got Ted Cruz's position on debates
we've got the Republican idea that Cruz
doesn't need to debate because he's up
nine do I think that Cruz is actually up
nine probably not I think Democrats need
to get out in Texas I'm not pretending
this is an easy one Texas hasn't voted
for a Democratic presidential candidate
since 76 no Democrat has won statewide
office in Texas since 1994 but the left
wants to believe that the reason Ted
Cruz isn't debating is that the first
debate was such a disaster for him that
it did so much damage that he thinks
he's better off simply not showing up to
the town hall I don't really buy that I
don't really buy that that's why Ted
Cruz isn't showing up yeah I don't think
he's afraid of
knowing what he's talking about or bado
catching him and any traps that sort of
thing I think he's just afraid of some
sort of gaffe right that's what these
people try to avoid and if you're up by
nine points why do you have to subject
yourself to that possibility so let's
explore whether he's really up nine okay
there are internal polls which we've
learned about from sources inside Ted
Cruz's campaign which say that this is
not a nine-point spread that the
possibility of this race being within
the margin of error is a very real
possibility so I believe that the
reality is probably a combination of the
two on the one hand you do have public
polling showing Ted Cruz way ahead but
most of those public polls are based on
what's called a likely voter model and
what that does is it assesses the
likelihood that a voter is actually
going to vote and it only is a poll of
those that the model determines are
likely to vote young people are
underrepresented in likely voter models
because one question that you're asked
in determining your likelihood of voting
is have you voted before if you're 18 19
20 or 21 and you were not 18 at the time
of the last election you haven't voted
before therefore you are less likely to
vote according to these likely voter
models the young people are under
counted so I think the Cruz campaign
knows this I think they know that they
have internal polls that show that this
is much closer it doesn't look nearly as
good for Cruz as the nine-point lead
that the New York Times claims that he
has there has also been record high
turnout for Democratic registration in
Texas and Democratic primary turnout the
highest in 24 years so if you do a more
nuanced analysis of the polling data
from Texas you look at new voter
registrations you look at likely voter
models and understand how that probably
is hurting better or work in the polls
this actually could be much closer than
9 points do I think that Beto O'Rourke
is clearly in the lead
no at the best case scenario is that
it's within the margin of error right
now and I think it's safe to say that if
beta or Roarke does pull this off we're
gonna be seeing a huge blue wave of the
2018 midterms that would mean that
Democrats are taking the Senate and they
had a strong night yeah it wouldn't be
you wouldn't just have better or better
or work defeating Ted Cruz and no other
Democratic wave I think
the point you're making it's all that
these these races are correlated good
news is we don't have to wait that much
longer
early voting actually starts Monday
October 22nd you can be damn sure that I
will be reminding you that early voting
starts in just 12 days okay there is a
Republican state representative in
Minnesota named Duane quam and he seems
like a really angry guy he's running
against Jamie mahlberg who's female and
Jamie mahlberg is giving him a run for
his money
qualm has been the incumbent and he's
been in for four terms he's the
Republican Jamie mahlberg is the
Democrat they had a debate where they
had to share a microphone which sounds
crazy it's not ideal but in local races
these sorts of things can happen at
debates where even though you've got two
candidates there's just one microphone
available and you've got to pass it back
and forth Jamie qualms got a I'm sorry
not not Jamie qualms Duane qualms I
combined their names
Duane qualm got a turn answering a
question then it was Jamie mal Burke's
turn to respond and as she finishes
speaking qualm rips the microphone from
her hand and she sort of jumps her
startles and it's all on video let's
take a look and you can hear the crowd
sort of gasp taken aback when he grabs
the mic out of her hand that formula
increases over time with inflation thank
you the problem we've got in education
is we are funding failure so he gets
this very angry rebuttal which also was
just terrible policy I mean his
education policy is also terrible but
maybe we'll get to that and then when
he's done with this rebuttal he goes to
hand the mic back to Jamie mahlberg and
it's great to be joined today by Nathan
J Robinson who's the editor of current
affairs author of several books
including the current affairs rules for
life and Trump anatomy of a monstrosity
we'll talk first a little bit about our
newest Supreme Court justice Brett
Kavanaugh Nathan you write in an article
which I found very interesting that
there's sort of another whole set of
issues here that are separate from the
sort of adjudication of what happened
with dr. Christine Blasi Ford and other
women years ago which is the fact that
Brett Kavanaugh has lied a bunch of
times during the most recent and prior
hearings and that regardless of the
truth or falsity of the sexual assault
claims that alone is a very good reason
for him not to be on the court so talk a
little bit about how you sort of
conceived of this article yeah it was a
lot to me because the focus of a lot of
the discussion was on figuring out
whether Brett Kavanaugh had in fact
assaulted Christine Blasi Ford and
whether there was enough evidence and
what the standard of proof should be and
all is important but there was another
issue which is that when you looked at
evanov testimony a lot of the things he
said were simply manipulative or untrue
and Regatta and if that's the case if
it's the case that a judge who is under
oath and is testifying before the Senate
says things that are not true or
misleads the Senate that really should
end the issue it's a it's a it's very
serious right so as I looked through the
testimony I thought well people aren't
zeroing in on some of the really
important ways in which Cavanaugh
misrepresented the truth and if if if we
just discuss that if it's provable and I
think it is provable then it doesn't
matter if you prove the allegations or
not because he should be disqualified in
his I want to talk about Republicans in
a second first we'll talk about how
Democrats handled this Bernie Sanders
did write a letter where he said he
wanted the potential perjury stuff
looked into but beyond that tell me if
I'm wrong I didn't really see a
clamoring from from Democrats in general
to focus in on the fact that the guy
appears to have lied no I think I think
and I think this was a mistake I think
Democrats spent a lot of the hearings
pushing for an FBI investigation which
they should have known would be flimsy
at best and and I think they they truck
they got caught up in this question of
who what happened that night in nineteen
in the early eighties and what what did
Brett Kavanaugh do this and you know
making the argument that he the the
evidence was sufficient to where he
should be up the court and they didn't
as I say they didn't focus in on the
fact that he misrepresented a number of
crucial things right he said that all of
the people that Christine Ford says were
there said the event didn't happen well
that's just false one of them says she
actually believes Ford uh he said that
he never attended an event with the
people that she alleges he the event was
with and if you look the calendars that
he submitted as evidence he did in fact
an attended event the calendars he yeah
there was this awful one where he said
it was asked about the way bass made fun
of this girl in high school and sort of
suggested that she slept around and he
said oh no we never never suggested that
well it's actually very very clear that
they did they even wrote a poem about
how easy she was and and there are other
students now have come out and said no
he was lying about that it was they were
definitely making fun of her about sex
and and and he denied it under oath and
and you can't do that you shouldn't be
able to do that if you're a federal
judge so on the one hand I agree that
Democrats did sort of make this mistake
by pushing for the FBI investigation
into sort of the the idea of
adjudicating what did or didn't take
place in the early 80s at the same time
that was the only thing that even
delayed the confirmation the week that
it did if I I think that there's a
possibility that if they focus from the
beginning on the possible perjury that
you don't even get a delay and he ends
up going
firmed even earlier yeah but the timing
of his confirmation doesn't matter that
much if he's going to be confirmed I
mean I I think he was going to be
confirmed no matter what the question is
do you what what can you do when you
know that they have the votes to confirm
him and I think first I think you would
have had a higher chance of getting some
of the quote moderate Republicans to be
a little wary er about confirming him if
you had preferred gone hard on the it's
provable that he said things that were
not true angle I think I think that
would be harder for them to deal with
they had an FBI investigation to point
to to cover their vote they can't really
do that so much if you if you just lay
out the perjury thing before the
American public very very clearly and
it's also a really good way of building
clear public support and and and I think
it's really hard for Republicans to
defend there is a mechanism through
which as a Supreme Court justice he
could be removed or impeached and it
requires a majority of the house and
two-thirds of the Senate Democrats may
well have a majority in the house
starting in January depending on the
results last less than four weeks from
now two-thirds of the Senate is is not
going to happen and quite frankly I just
don't see any way in which even if you
prove that that he lied that you get
whatever number you need 14 or however
many Republicans to say yeah we're gonna
go ahead with this yeah you're not
actually going to get him impeached and
removed from office I think if you do
emphasize impeachment and you use that
as a sort of slogan you're doing it not
because you think you can actually get
it done but because it's important to
make clear that he's not a legitimate
Supreme Court justice that he ought to
you know it calls into question all of
his rulings he's always kind of a
justice with an asterisk next to his
name and and the American people come to
see him as a Justice who ought to be
removed and you shouldn't emphasize the
impeachment what you should emphasize is
the the fact that he warrants
impeachment that this is a guy who
really in if we were evaluating
in a sort of fair-minded manner she just
shouldn't be on the court and if you can
build public consensus around that that
that really helps the Democratic Party
to make its case in elections that the
that they are the ones who are going to
who are going to treat the court as it
should be treated does it though because
while I agree with you on the politics
and the underlying analysis it's not
going to really successfully be done in
advance of this November and then do you
really think that pushing the fact that
Cavanaugh lied during his 2018 hearings
would help Democrats in 2020 like I just
think people will have forgotten about
it and they won't care no not not on its
own but I think as part of an X you have
to build everything into part of it into
a narrative and and narratives are what
win elections and this is a small part
of the narrative that American the
Democrats should be thinking well what
is going to show people oh that we are
right and that we ought to be voted for
and I think saying look Republicans will
put a perjurer on the court if it helps
further their political agenda and they
don't actually care about their
principles and values and use that as
one in a series of examples of that I
think that can actually be persuasive no
I don't think impeach Cavanaugh should
be the slogan for 2020 oh but I don't
think you should let it go because I
think it is a pretty powerful thing and
it's pretty easily provable so the
narrative and the values are something I
want to touch on next with you from a
sort of cultural perspective it's it's
abundantly clear to me and to many who
have been following the so-called
value-based politics of the American
Republican Party for a while that the
values aren't real values they're
basically ways to get people to either
donate to you or to vote for you like
abortions always been a great example
which is we know how to reduce the
number of abortions but Republicans
don't want to do it because it doesn't
it doesn't fall in line with their
values which is access to contraception
comprehensive sex education etc here
they've been able to say that even
though it appears as though the alleged
actions of Cavanaugh might go against
their stated values the value that they
are defending
is innocent until proven guilty you've
not definitively proven his guilt and
thus it is in line with their values to
say we can't stop him from being on the
court do you agree that this is like one
of the most successful elements of the
American right which is no matter what
happens they can craft a narrative that
appears to fit into their stated values
well they're brilliant at doing politics
I mean I I have to give them credit they
always win I mean they've been winning
all around the country all the state
legislatures even in blue states are
falling state governorships
the other they're excellent at selling
people or on this these phony values
whether it is as you say abortion where
it's like well most women say that they
get abortions partially for economic
reasons they can't afford a child and it
you're not gonna have paid family leave
policies or whether it's this until
proven guilty thing which it's
interesting because you never hear about
innocent it's the ACLU and and the
public defenders who are always talking
about the horrors of the criminal
justice system of what happens when
people are accused and tried without
without due process yeah it falls apart
under under scrutiny because you say
okay well innocent until proven guilty
sure but what if we think there's a
twenty percent chance that this guy did
it would you be comfortable in putting
that person on the court if you think
there's any chance that he did it that's
reasonable or you know look at the
perjury um but they say it it's catchy
and they're good at pushing it innocent
until proven guilty how do you oppose
innocent until proven guilty no
corroborating evidence and that's kind
of persuasive people they go oh yeah no
corroborating evidence innocent until
proven guilty so yeah we need to get
better at politics I've been reading
some very interesting books on law
enforcement and police interrogation
because I think there's a lot of
analogies there to political debate
interestingly enough and one of the
points I see made it made time and time
again is when you're trying to persuade
someone of something whether it's to can
to a crime or to see your your point of
view on a political issue whatever we
tend to argue on the basis of our values
rather than the values of the person
that we're trying to persuade and so
you're talking about economic inequality
in terms that resonate to the left won't
necessarily influence somebody on the
right because they might just have two
totally different values so do you have
a sense and you can pick a particular
political issue or we can talk about the
cabinet I think oh really whatever way
you want to go what are some ways that
the left can appeal to the rights values
without sort of giving up their their
position on what they see as the
important values either if that makes
sense
well you know I would actually take the
opposite approach I think you got to be
very careful about not III I've read an
article called don't I think don't base
left-wing arguments on right-wing
premises interesting and I and I talk a
lot about things like where you adopt
the rights values and I think it's
actually a mistake a lot of the time to
try and make the case for left-wing
ideas without making the case for
left-wing values and saying one of the
examples of this that I that I use is
that everything is phrased in terms of
saving money well this will make and we
the left often talks about criminal
justice like this while you know the
death penalty for example is really
expensive it costs a lot of money and
it's a well so if you if you want the
government to save money you should
oppose the death penalty now really
that's not why we oppose the death
penalty on the Left we oppose it because
we we don't think the state has should
be killing people who don't pose the
threat anymore but we say it saves money
well you know first there's not even a
very persuasive argument because a good
way to save money is to like execute
people immediately after trial which I'm
sure get rid of all the appeals but also
you know it's when you make a case that
is on grounds that are not the real
reason that you support a thing you can
sound kind of dishonest and I actually
think it's much harder to make the case
for left-wing values when people don't
share those values but
I think you shouldn't be trying to
persuade people who have committed and
unyielding conservative principles and
say well actually our policies you know
follow conservative principles what do
you do right because if if your values
are different than their so they're
certainly not going to come around to
your values and at the same time you
shouldn't show how there might be a way
in which your values and their values
could lead you down to the same policy
in the end then what do you do well the
question is who you're talking to
right and the fact is that more people
don't vote than vote for either one of
the two parties so I don't think you
should be I don't think you should cast
your appeal to people who have
inflexible conservative values you
should be trying to talk to people who
do kind of share your underlying
sympathies or could be brought around to
it but are not particularly politically
active the fact is that you know left
values I happen to think are shared by
the majority of people I think I think
polling data kind of suggests that I
think most people are generally
empathetic and can be precise I would
prefer to try and sell people on my
understanding of your criminal justice
rehabilitation which is that like I
believe in people and I think people
need second chances than to try and
persuade people on a cost saving
argument I there are people that I can't
convince with that because they'll just
dismiss me out of hand but there are
other people who will be more persuaded
by that because they'll understand that
I'm being honest and I'm present this is
why people like this is why a lot of
people like Bernie Sanders even if
they're less that there's a group of
people who are even people who vote kind
of conservative who will respect Bernie
Sanders more than they respect say
Hillary Clinton because they think well
I disagree with him more but he's more
honest and so I trust him more that's a
good place to pause we are speaking with
Nathan J Robinson editor of current
affairs author of several books and
tomorrow we will continue our
conversation with him about the
intellectual dark web so called as I say
it's great to be joined today by Steve
keen who is an economist professor at
Kingston University London also author
of several books including debunking
economics and most recently can we avoid
another financial crisis now crowdfunded

like professor Steve Kean ke en Steve
great to talk to you thank you for being
with us a lot of to be asked so this
topic of realistic economics has been
really interesting to me for a long time
and I think it's a really important
issue in general because it affects so
much policy that our elected officials
are talking about all the time so maybe
like at the top level just to get our
audience into the idea of what you're
discussing here what is not realistic
about how economics is mostly taught at
the college level well the answer that
is almost virtually everything but I
think I should start from a wonderful
quip from that brilliant American
satirist so mentioned many many decades
ago and he said that to every human
problem there is a solution which is
neat plausible and wrong and that's the
situation with economic theory it looks
neat
it looks plausible but when you dig into
the foundations it's actually wrong so
for example it take I think the simplest
example this is the one that I start my
lectures with of my students at Kingston
and that is the idea of the supply curve
now the idea of the supply curve you
know you do the classic drawing it every
economics textbook has and I think it
inhabits the mind of economists a very
very deep level is argyria intersecting
supply and demand curves as supply curve
that slopes up because people think that
this makes sense to you if you want to
buy some more or something that's going
to cost more so that's what people think
at the plausible level but when you look
at what actually arguing they're saying
well the risen price rises is because
the productivity of your variable input
which is laid by fundamentally Falls as
you produce more output so you have a
increasing level of output are you
paying the same wage for a worker but
each worker is producing slightly less
than the one before therefore your cost
per unit Rises that's why you have a
rising supply curve it is empirical
nonsense it has been torn apart
by something like about 40 or so surveys
the last one being done by Alan Blinder
who and he did it was a vice president
of the American Economic Association so
I'm not talking raving radicals here and
what he found was that when you asked
firms what their cost structure were
they had constant or falling marginal
cost they didn't have diminishing
marginal productivity at all and the
reason is quite simple thankfully
economists do not design factories
engineers do and they build them so they
as they approach capacity they become
more efficient they which maximum
capacity when the factories could at
full at full by usage stage you normally
build a factory and started with about
say 70% capacity because you're
expecting growth over time and as you
approach that peak level of performance
your costs actually fall so let me see
if I rather just because our audience
our audience may not be let's see if we
can just rephrase so we can make sure we
are so there's this idea that in basic
economics that as you supply more of a
widget for example that the cost to
supply that widget is going to go up but
that in practice what actually seems to
be the case is that you are able to
reduce the cost per widget as you
produce more because of efficiencies
that exist within manufacturing to take
the factory example is that more or less
what you're saying yes the factory is a
production line you design it to work
best when the factory is going
gangbusters you build the factory with
spare capacity as you approach
gangbusters scale your costs actually
fall so rather than a rising supply
curve of anything that should be a
horizontal or falling supply curve and
once you do that the entire theory of
economics starts to unravel and that
applies to so many points in the theory
that it's almost beyond cataloging them
all let's talk a little bit about the
the sort of rational actor theories of
economics I've spoken extensively about
the work of behavioral economists
including folks like Daniel Kahneman and
so many others and there are so many
different data points that we
increasingly have which tell us that the
idea of sort of standard
economics that every participant in an
economic system is always acting
completely rationally on the basis of
the information that's available is
simply not true but yet the idea still
continues to persist what is your
assessment of the best way to understand
why the rational actor hypothesis simply
is not realistic
well simplest reason is because the way
they define rational if you actually
took out the lift the word out and gave
the definition that they give it what
rational behavior is what it comes down
to is people have a model in their heads
which is able to accurately predict the
future now if you told somebody here's a
definition what's the word that goes
with it they wouldn't use rational
they'd choose the word prophetic mmm or
say what they actually build a well they
actually call rational behavior is
prophetic behavior now I'm sorry I'm not
rational because I don't have prophecy
is one of my skills and and and I hope
it's the reason they've actually got
this concept is because they would have
liked the market to dominate even if you
had irrational behavior they would have
liked that outcome when they did all
their various bits and pieces of
modeling they aren't that the market
would not reach equilibrium it wouldn't
reach the ideal point so they because
it's pretended that we could actually
predict what that ideal point should be
and move to it anyway so effectively
their idea of rational agents as saying
the whole that your universe is
inhabited by gods who can predict the
future accurately in which case what do
they need a market for so it's actually
a failure of the theory but it's
disguised by the use of language is
there a case to be made and I asked this
sincerely not in a rhetorical way or
with any kind of preconceived notion is
there a case to be made that despite all
of the failings and inaccuracies that we
now know exist with the sort of
traditional schools of economic thought
that there is still some logic to
starting with that because it does
create a framework which we could then
explain the failings of where if I think
back to microeconomics 101 and
macroeconomics 102 in college I now
understand why what was presented there
does not make sense but I'm curious as
to whether if I had jumped right in
to behavioral economics and some of the
other things that you and I are talking
about and are going to talk about I
would have lacked the foundation to then
understand why it doesn't make sense if
my question is clear well you understand
what the theory doesn't make sense but I
think what it actually does is it
distracts you from what's actually
interesting about capitalism because
what it's about fundamentally telling
you as a capitalist system that reaches
equilibrium and if we make a few little
assumptions like all goods like all cars
are the same and all TV shows are the
same and so on homogenized in this to
make it easy to understand in fact
what's special about capitalism is not
equilibrium at all it's far from
equilibrium behave if you're pushing you
to innovate and and consequently the
theory itself distracts you from what's
not just what's bad about capitalism
what's good about it and I would rather
say let's start all over again and begin
with an evolutionary framework and say
what we see in capitalism is an
evolutionary system and compared to
previous social systems like feudalism
and socialism for that matter there's
far more innovation far more
revolutionary change in capitalism and
that's a good thing and then we could
start from that perspective and get a
very very different view of the world
which would be more accurate so in other
words if I hear you correctly you're
saying that the way economics is taught
gets both the failings and successes of
capitalism wrong yeah you don't get any
explanation for example in a
conventional economic theory of why
growth occurs you simply say there is an
improvement in technology over time now
I would like to understand why does
technology improve what are the factors
behind it and if you read Shawn Pater
for example is a very much a non
neoclassical economist it gives a
wonderful explanation of why capitalists
innovate and why that sort of level of
innovation didn't occur in a feudal
system and another non-orthodox
economist called Janos corn I it was
Hungarian and trying to understand why
Sascha lists economies grew so slowly
developed a concept with what he called
demand constraint versus resource
constrained economies saying that
socialist a resource constrained and
therefore you try to make last year's
product in a larger scale whereas
capitalist ones of the demand
constrained and to grab hold of that
demand
you need to innovate more than your
competitive house that's a much richer
appreciation of capitalism than what you
get out of neoclassical theory what are
the political implications of these
fundamental misunderstandings of
economics and how its taught and and if
you want to get into specific policy
that is sort of put on the back of bad
economics that I think that would be
interesting whether it's tax policy
understandings of debt and deficit
austerity measures whatever like how
does the foundational problem of how
economics is taught lead to elected
officials making bad policy I think the
best air is the financial system because
that's not one that I actually raising
your left versus right political
feelings about it it's obvious the
financial system failed in 2008 why did
economists not see that it was going to
fail because they convince themselves
they could model capitalism while
leaving the financial sector completely
out of their equations so they weren't
even looking at what caused the
financial crisis at the same time they
are advising politicians that it was a
really good idea to deregulate banks to
expand their operations and don't worry
about the level of private debt that's
irrelevant now that's completely
disastrously wrong advice it's like
telling a captain of a titanic don't
don't worry about icebergs and ice
fluffy things that can't hurt you so can
you go into more depth about that I mean
when we think back to the 2008 financial
crisis there are sort of not necessarily
competing explanations for it but
certainly differing explanations in
terms of the importance of any one
factor whether it's deregulation
mortgage crisis cyclical downturn etc
how would you is it even possible to
start to unpack what is actually the
initial catalyst for such a downturn
absolutely and this has been 30 years
doing this and there's plenty of any of
my successors and co-workers have done
the same thing
it was credit we had too much private
credit and the simple dynamics is that
credit which is borrowing money from
banks adds to the money supply and adds
to the amount of demand in existence but
of course it also adds to the amount of
debt
so as you rely more and more upon credit
the level of private debt Rises
you reach a point where that private
debt can't be serviced because many of
the ventures finances have been Ponzi
schemes that have failed or bad badly
thought out ventures to begin with the
level of credit drops and when it drops
you go from credit bursting demand to
credit actually subtracting from demand
now that's why I've started warning
about the crisis myself in 2005 the end
of 2005 and when Godley beat me by about
six years and had a fall beat me by a
couple of years plenty of people who
look at the level of debt private debt
and say that's the credit causes demand
and when it stops growing they'll be a
crisis we were the ones who warned about
the crisis and were ignored because he
weren't part of the mainstream so it's
extremely easy to unpack what caused the
crisis and when you do you come up with
policies that say you shouldn't
deregulate banks you should actually be
controlling the money creation powers
they have I think that that's a great
place to pause in exactly where I want
to pick up the conversation in part two
which relates to not only private debt
but even at the national level
discussions about debt and deficit and
where they go wrong we're speaking with
economist Steve Kean he has written a
number of books including debunking
economics and most recently can we avoid
another financial crisis and we'll
continue our conversation with him in
part two we're continuing our
conversation with Steve Keane who is an
economist professor at Kingston
University London he's authored several
books most recently can we avoid another
financial crisis and he is crowdfunded

Steve Keen we left off part 1 talking
about debt and you were specifically
talking about private debt I have been
studying modern monetary theory for the
last couple of years and I want to get
your thoughts on at the federal level at
the government level debt deficit and
whether it is as I now increasingly see
it a political football that is not
objectively telling us anything about
how the economy is doing where do you
fall on the topic of the national debt
and deficit in terms of its relation to
evaluating how an economy is doing
pretty much aligned with non-monetary
theory but I take much more of a
perspective of the role of
banking sector and I start from there
they tend to start from the government
sector and I also work very much in
strictly monetary economics so I build a
software package I call Minsky that does
monetary modeling and an essential part
of a monetary vision is that if you look
at your financial situation you look at
your assets you look at your liabilities
and you look at your equity which is the
gap between your assets and your
liabilities and the fundamental rule of
accounting is the assets minus
liabilities minus equity equals zero and
banks financial institutions which
create money by levering up the equity
they have so they must have assets minus
liabilities being greater than being
greater than zero so they have positive
equity a bank goes bankrupt when it gets
negative equity if you look at if you
imagine that the sort of vision that a
lot of right wing commentators have
right-wing economists have Austrians in
particular that they should get rid of
government completely then you the only
source of money would be the banks
now if the banks must maintain assets
minus liabilities greater than zero by
definition the rest of society has to
have a negative equity and what is the
impact of that that the impact of that
is none of us want negative equity we'd
all like to have positive equity you
want to be able to say all my assets
minus liabilities is positive but you
have a banking sector which if it's the
only source of money it must have
positive otherwise the banks file there
for the rest of us the non-bank section
of the economy must have negative equity
but we all want positive equity so what
do we do we borrow money from the banks
gamble on rising asset prices and we
record the value of those assets as the
price the very last house sold for
multiplied by the entire stock of houses
as if we could all sell every last house
that exists for the price the last one
sold for totally fictional but that's
what convinces us we have positive
equity now as a result we get caught up
in bubbles Ponzi schemes and stuff like
that and if you look at what the
government does when you inject the
government into a scene like that the
government can actually handle having
negative negative equity nobody ever
goes and asks the Treasury or
Federal Reserve what's your net worth
net worth is the country called America
so they that they don't have the same
constraints that we have so what happens
when when a government spends it puts
money in your bank account when it taxes
it takes money out of your bank account
if it's spending exceeds its taxation
its injecting net equity into your bank
account and therefore you can reach your
goal of having positive equity without
letting to speculate on stock markets
and housing markets but because with
this this ideology this anti-government
ideology and because we think the
government is like a household and has
to tax before it can spend we end up
having those politicians trying to push
the government into running a surplus
now by definition if you divide the
world into sector a and sector B
whatever they are financially if sector
a has a positive equity secretary B has
a negative equity so the government's
trying to achieve positive equity for
itself it's driving us to the negative
equity which is one of the problems so
can we then get into the conversation
about when we point to the united states
is running XX sized deficit this year
for example does that objectively tell
us anything or does it matter what that
equity what that deficit came from in
other words it seems to me that if you
give a hundred billion dollars to the
richest 1% in tax cuts and go into
deficit for that they have a high
propensity to save that money because
they don't necessarily need it for
day-to-day spending and thus the
multiplier effect that you achieve with
that hundred billion dollars is
relatively low compared for example to
if you were to spend that hundred
billion on health care healthier people
work more meaning they earn higher wages
meaning the government collects more
payroll taxes and income taxes so is
that a reasonable assessment that not
every dollar of deficit means the same
thing is true but also at the aggregate
level the the level of the deficit which
is let's call it what it is it's the
excess of government spending over
taxation if you and I did that
indefinitely we'd be at we'd be bankrupt
it's a deficit for us but if you're got
the capacity to create money which of
course governments have
then it's a record of their money
creation over time and when you take a
look at it the if you make the White
House actually publishes a long term
series called America's I think the the
government surplus when you look at the
average level of that surplus per year
over the last 120 years the data starts
pretty much in 1900 the average level of
that surplus is minus 2.4 percent of GDP
in other words spending exceeds taxation
by about 2.4 percent of GDP for a
hundred and twenty years if you take out
the war years it falls to about 2.3
percent or 2.2 percent so the walls
don't make much difference so for a one
and a half one and a quarter centuries
the American government has been
spending more than it gets back in
taxation now critics of this say well
okay I've got to talk about something
that I think some people aren't going to
like you know that on this show there
are no sacred cows right this is a
left-wing progressive show so a lot of
the criticisms are of right-wing ideas
and of right-wing people but there's no
short there's no short fall there's no
shortage of misguided left-wing ideas
and left-wing people and I call them out
I don't believe in tribalism that says
even if there are people on the Left who
are toxic or have bad ideas you can't
criticize them because they're part of
the same movement the same tribe the
same left-wing so last week we got a
live call as you know Pat we don't
screen live calls for topics people can
ask anything they want and a caller said
David what do you think about Jimmy Dore
who's now going to battle against Sam
cedar or Bernie aoc Andrew Gilliam
Gilliam I don't even know how he says
his last name and I gave my opinion I
gave my opinion as I always do which was
to say in this case that I think Jimmy
Dore has become totally toxic I think
he's a useful idiot and a tool of really
bad movements and I got a ton of angry
emails and dislikes and even a handful
of people who had paid subscriptions to
the show who canceled them this is
really a concern it's a concern for me
but it's a concern for the left here's
an example email okay this is from
former member Jacqueline who said David
it's very disappointing that you have
opted to do an on-air attack to do on
air attacks on Jimmy Dore quote
completely toxic useful idiot and
dum-dum left were the choice words by
extension you are referring to his
audience as well which happens to
overlap with your audience sadly I was
foolish enough to pay the annual fee for
my Pakman membership which was valid
till next dot I still canceled anyway
you can consider this hatred mail if you
so choose but that's not what it is by
having segments attacking other
progressives who aren't lockstep with
your views you are the one being toxic
this is one of a handful of people who
wrote me stuff like this and canceled
memberships so first of all just
consider the irony that they say I'm
being toxic by attacking a progressive
who's not in lockstep with my views by
canceling their memberships because I
think door is toxic they are attacking
me financially for not being in lockstep
with their views it
sort of the same thing this is really
important okay don't miss the irony of
that but more importantly the left can't
be like this
okay there are bad ideas on the left and
right there are bad faith actors on the
left and right there are way more on the
right and we mostly focus on the ones on
the right but consider the opposite when
I get a call that says David what do you
think about the direction Jimmy Dore has
gone in my alternative instead of giving
you my honest opinion is to lie and say
he's doing great work would the audience
want me to lie and just say something
like that because of tribalism or so
that I don't anger certain people in the
audience I can't imagine that that's
what the audience wants and if the idea
is that I need to turn the show not into
what I genuinely think but instead into
what the leftist group think has
determined is better for quote the
movement that is a tribalistic disaster
so assuming you don't want me to lie to
you basically people who canceled
because I gave my honest opinion about
Jimmy are saying they're cancelling
because I have the wrong opinion and I
think that that's really dangerous
because as I've said before no two
people are going to agree on everything
ever right and if independent media is
going to survive and thrive which I
believe it needs to do okay
it can't depend on the financial support
that exists only up until there's a
disagreement on one issue right of
course people can choose to support me
or not support me for any reason right
or any other show for that matter but
this is why the right is succeeding in
so many ways they have made a commitment
where they say let's support people who
are basically on our side they might be
anti-gay but if there's a pro-gay rights
Republican who's mostly on their side
and helps their movement they support
that person they are anti-abortion but
if there's a pro-choice conservative
that's generally furthering I don't know
there's small government views or
they're low tax views or whatever they
support that person if this is how the
left is going to sit decide who we
support we're going to fail
okay and by the way if we apply the no
support if they say one wrong thing idea
what about all the people who were
supporting Jimmy Dore despite the fact
that he did at one point push seth rich
conspiracy theories if you don't buy
that stuff and i think most people in my
audience do not
wouldn't that be disqualifying of your
support for jimmy right so the main
point is let's not allow ourselves to be
ripped apart in this way and we can't do
this type of tribalism this type of
tribalism is going to destroy the
movement from the inside out if you
really think the problem is only
progressives making honest critiques of
other progressives when they feel
they're warranted and making critiques
of the right when those are warranted
that is not actually the problem and we
really need to think hard about what it
is that we're saying when you say i'm
pulling my support because i disagree
with you about this issue or that issue
or think that it should be off-limits to
criticize other progressive media i want
to hear from you about this there is a
just blockbuster bombshell new story
that we must talk about and i want to
kind of set this up for you by telling
you what this is not about we have trump
russia going on with a special
prosecutor robert muller put that aside
for now we have this abortive attempted
confirmation of donald trump Supreme
Court pick Brett Kavanaugh an alleged
serial sex assault er this is not that
story we have which we'll talk about a
little bit later on in the program this
not really new trade deal called the
u.s. MCA put that aside for now put
basically every scandal and every failed
promise aside that we have seen from and
by the Trump administration for now
because we have something totally new
that's going on this is a new state tax
investigation that has started as a
result of massive massive allegations of
fraud against Donald Trump and his
family in a just extraordinarily
detailed and thoroughly researched New
York Times special investigator
so here's what's going on New York Times
yesterday has published a to call it
lengthy is an understatement to call it
extensive as an understatement
investigation which exposes that Trump
and his family have committed quote
instances of outright fraud that is a
direct phrase from the investigation
meant to transfer millions upon millions
of dollars from Trump's father Fred
Trump to his kids without paying the
taxes that one is supposed to pay in
addition to just the claims made by the
New York Times New York state tax
officials have said we are now looking
into this there is a confirmed state tax
state-level tax investigation into what
the allegations are from the New York
Times yet another one of Donald Trump's
lawyers this is one I hadn't previously
heard of his name is Charles harder
apparently that's his real name
he obviously denied that Donald Trump
has done anything wrong has committed
any fraud no wrongdoing whatsoever
according to councilor harder the
mechanisms used here according to the
investigation to move this money around
in a way that it would not be subject to
the taxes that would normally be
prescribed by law include number one
improper tax deductions number two the
straight-up undervaluation of real
estate holdings by hundreds of millions
of dollars that what what that quite
simply means is that if you have a
building worth you know twenty million
dollars just the numbers don't really
matter when you transfer that you
straight up claim that the value of that
building is much smaller which reduces
the transfer tax liability and other
taxes that may be associated depending
on whether those property transfers are
happening while the owner is alive or
through their estate once they have
passed away the New York Times also
writes because this is as soon as I read
this the scope and size of this
investigation is so significant
that any realistically credible
investigative entity would absolutely be
in touch with the people who are the
subjects of the story in this case
Donald Trump and his family to get
comment from them and indeed they they
have been they've explained that for
weeks as they've been working on this
story they tried to get statements from
Trump about this they told him they are
working on this
another nothing other than this brief
statement in which Charles harder says
yeah this was Trump's family but Trump
didn't actually do anything it has
nothing to do with Trump period it is
important to point out and this is where
we get to you know we have at least two
justice systems and we also have
probably probably more than that in some
way remember actor Wesley Snipes actor
Wesley Snipes was sentenced to three
years in prison
because of tax charges that were a mere
fraction of what is alleged here against
Donald Trump and his family that's what
I was thinking as I read through this
piece and read through the allegations
that are made here and the other thing
that went through my mind is if the New
York Times was able to figure out this
much stuff and in such detail about
Donald Trump's family's financial
dealings and potential criminality
Muller must know way more than any of us
are accounting for right and that is
something that importantly signals that
the claims that Trump was laundering
Russian money those claims are even more
credible because it appears as though
his entire family has been doing exactly
those types of financial manipulations
through real estate for a decade upon
decade think about that for a moment if
you read Trump's been laundering money
for Russians for years might be true
might be circumstantially supported by
things we know about Donald Trump and
what he and his sons have said but we
now have specific allegation
from the New York Times extraordinarily
well researched allegations that the
Trump family has made it not a habit but
a sort of way of life to use real estate
to move money around in ways that are
evading what the law is surrounding that
money it is significantly more
believable it's almost obvious that of
course Trump was doing money laundering
for the Russians through real estate he
learned how to use real estate to move
money around discreetly or or
surreptitiously from his own father
if this investigation is to be believed
so in the last 24 hours consider what
we've learned in the last 24 - I guess
36 hours we've learned that Brett
Kavanaugh and we'll talk about this
momentarily try to fix his alibi before
Debora Ramirez allit ret Deborah Ramirez
his allegations were made public via The
New Yorker article and potentially
tampered with witnesses we learned that
Donald Trump tried to get stormy Daniels
silenced in advance of that story going
public and now we are learning more and
more about the really undeniable reality
as we've suspected for a long time that
Donald Trump's wealth likely came not
just from that small loan of a million
dollars from his dad but also from
massive criminal level tax fraud which
we are only starting to learn about one
other just little note it's very
interesting to me that the way that this
was supposedly being done according to
the New York Times it involves sort of
more nuanced and sophisticated
accounting and tax stuff and then it
also involves just basic lying about how
billed how much buildings are worth
which is sort of exactly emblematic of
how Donald Trump does things he will lie
and deceive in ways that are more
sophisticated and then he'll straight-up
lie to your face which is exactly what
you're doing when you say my 50 million
dollar building know that this isn't a
good building this thing's only worth 2
million dollars we will absolutely be
following this and again there is now a
new investigation by the New York State
tax department and we'll see what they
ultimately come up with
let's focus in now on lies while under
oath by Brett Kavanaugh we already
talked about how he straight-up didn't
answer many questions during that
hearing where we heard from Brett
Kavanaugh and from his first of many
accusers Christine Blasi Ford we already
talked about the fact that many times
senators started picking apart his
claims that he never blacked out from
drinking to the point where he might not
remember what he did on some nights we
already talked about how his sort of
baseline unhinged nature makes him
fundamentally unfit to be on the Supreme
Court but now I want to focus in on lies
that he told remember senators Jeff
Flake and Chris Coons who called for
this investigation last night said if
any lying is uncovered that's likely the
end of this nomination for Brett
Kavanaugh so this matters okay it's
really important to understand that
Cavanaugh is lying about lots of little
things and that should disqualify him
from being on the court even if it's
each individual lies small or relatively
unimportant it's still against the law
to lie under oath and it still makes him
a liar people who know Cavanaugh are
flooding out saying he lied he lied many
times during the hearing every few hours
there's a new article with people who
know him saying this was a lie that was
a lie Cavanaugh lied so much actually
that it's hard to even know where to
start but let's first start with his
claim about getting into Yale part of
Brett Kavanaugh is unhinged ranting on
Thursday included him saying that he got
into Yale on the basis of his hard work
and that he had no connections to Yale
whatsoever he his exact words that day
were a quote senator you were asking
about college I got into Yale Law School
that's the number one law school in the
country
I had no connections there I got there
by busting my tail in college this is a
lie Brett Kavanaugh was a legacy
admission to Yale meaning he had prior
family members who went to Yale his
grandfather
Everett Edward Cavanaugh went to Yale to
little lie it's one of many but why is
he lying all the time and why do we need
to excuse those lies he claimed that a
Devil's Triangle is a drinking game it's
not other than references added from a
congressional IP address to Wikipedia
after his hearing he knows that it's a
sex act involving two men and a woman
and it's yet another lie he claimed that
the term boof related to flatulence
which it doesn't Cavanaugh knows that it
relates to anal sexual practices he
implied when talking about his drinking
that he was of legal age by saying you
know in 1982 I drank beer 18-year olds
could drink so the seniors could drink
legally that's right the seniors who
were 18 could drink legally he wasn't 18
at the time it's a small lie but it's
yet another lie and then there's kind of
like the bigger narrative lies okay
Cavanaugh's broader story was I just
didn't drink enough to forget stuff I
didn't drink enough to have foggy
memories despite the fact that senators
Booker and Blumenthal and others made a
Klobuchar and others made some pretty
significant progress in showing but that
wasn't true but before and since
Cavanaugh's testimony a bunch of his
classmates have come forward to say he
was frequently stumbling around drunk he
had no rational control over his actions
nor a clear recollection of them he was
asked during the hearing whether he
watched Christine Blasi Ford's testimony
he said no but I plan to watch it later
it was widely reported in multiple media
outlets that he was watching the
testimony the fact that Cavanaugh lied
so much about so many little things is
actually indicative of his they can't
touch me attitude which he shares with
who he shares that attitude with Donald
Trump when you were this willing to
perjure yourself you should not be on
the Supreme Court you really shouldn't
have any government job private
companies are free to decide Pat do they
care about the fact that this guy lies
all the time or not he really shouldn't
have any government job and as I said
before it's not likely that there's
going to be a perjury charge proven here
it's unlikely we're even going to get a
perjury charge but at least one senator
is getting tough on the crime of perjury
by Supreme Court nominees and that's
Bernie Sanders who has now actually
written a letter to Chuck Grassley
who's been running this entire circus of
a confirmation hearing saying the f
I should investigate not only the claims
of the accusers but also whether the guy
lied whether he perjured himself and in
his letter Bernie Sanders said in order
for this FBI investigation regarding
Judge Brett Cavanaugh's nomination to be
complete it is imperative the bureau
must not only look into the accusations
made by dr. Ford Deborah Ramirez and
Julie sweat NIC which they're not doing
by the way it should also examine the
veracity of his testimony before the
Judiciary Committee obviously Bernie
also points out that they should
investigate the claims of all three
women they're not doing that either
Julie sweat Nick attempting to get in
touch with no luck I would make the case
actually that perjury allegations or
maybe more damaging than the sexual
assault allegations not that lying about
what booth means is worse than raping a
woman that's not what I mean but what I
mean is no matter what the FBI comes up
with with regard to sexual assault it's
still gonna be a preponderance of
evidence thing and more than half of
Republicans as I'll tell you later don't
even think sex assault should disqualify
you from the Supreme Court in that sense
if you perjure yourself it's much more
cut and dry Republicans will still say I
don't care put them on the court but I
actually think that you you can make the
case that being a sloppy drunk in
college isn't necessarily disqualifying
from being on the Supreme Court
lying about it constantly as an adult
under oath however should disqualify you
from being on the court it's all just so
hard to prove though like when he claims
that Boo f---ing related to flatulence
not anal sex or The Devil's Triangle
that's a drinking game not a sex act I
mean in his circles he could claim that
that's what those terms meant you can't
just cite urban dictionary and say
there's a discrepancy here or you know I
mean his classmates will come out and
say that this guy drank a lot in college
right he was intoxicated every Friday
and Saturday night him it's it's
unbelievable to think that he could
remember some of that stuff well hey if
he says that he didn't black out how are
you gonna prove otherwise and when it
comes to perjury it does involve whether
he was deliberately saying something
that wasn't true or whether he genuinely
it's great to be joined today by Ross
Clark who's a columnist and a leader
writer on The Spectator also author of
the war against cash the plot to empty
your wallet and own your financial
future and why you must fight it Ross
I'm very interested in this topic I was
recently in Europe in Denmark I don't
believe that I touched local currency at
any point because the country has
essentially gone completely cashless if
not by default sort of de facto in a
sense let's first talk about why there
has been this move in many parts of the
world and then maybe we'll get into some
of the concerns about it what's
attractive about going cashless um what
from our point of view or from the
financial organization's point of view
or government's point of view yeah I
mean certainly not your it sounds like
you're not in favor of it so what would
be attractive to those who find it
attractive I guess um well I people it's
easy in some ways just to go around
tapping a card against a little card
reader and not fumble around with um
cash that that may be an advantage but
um I'm not against um electronic means
of payment I mean when we're making that
choice to use it that that's absolutely
fine by me and obviously if we're you
know buying stuff over a distance
something we need to do it in some
electronic form if I order a book from
Amazon or something I can't sort of get
the cash to them immediately so I don't
have a problem with electronic forms of
payment that the problem is when it
becomes compulsory when cash and
businesses governments and so on try to
squeeze cash out of use doing away
effectively with the competition that is
offered by using cash I'm going to turn
your question around a little I mean
what is attractive about using cash well
it's free when you and I can do business
with cash we don't have to go through a
middleman we don't have to pay anybody
don't have a bit of our transaction
creamed off by the payments industry and
you've only got to ask yourself what's
in it for the payments industry well an
awful lot um at the moment the the
payments industry is extracting 1
trillion pounds a year from us um by
2020 they reckon that will climb to 2
trillion pounds that is the value of the
cashless society to the payments
industry and that that's just from fees
the the other area which the payments
industry helps to cash in on the
cashless society that's and move it or
not um is through collection and the
sale of data on our spending habits you
know what when we go down to local store
and buy a coffee or something with cash
there's no record of that we could be
anybody buying it but you use your
contactless card your credit card or
some kind of electronic means of payment
and that is registered it creates a
little bit of data a little critten a
little bit of a pattern of your spending
habits and that is extremely valuable
data to marketing firms because then
they know what we're buying they know
the sort of stuff we'd like to buy they
can target us with advertising special
offers and and all the rest and you know
a large part of this move towards the
cashless society is being driven by that
industry by the data intelligence
industry if you like
so let's adapt to that momentarily I
mean to go back to the first part it's
important for people to understand that
even if to the end-user you say well I
either pay ten dollars in cash or ten
dollars with a credit card it's sort of
the exact same cost to me it's important
to understand that for every transaction
the business is paying a fee to the
merchant bank payment processing gateway
at some point if we move completely off
of cash those fees are going to be
priced into what you pay for products in
other words the business is going to
make a decision as to whether they want
to take a loss as a result of accepting
digital payments or whether they just
want to pass on those payments to the
consumer I think most will do the latter
and then at the macro level you
individually might put ten bucks on your
credit card and then pay it off within
30 days and not pay any interest but in
total we know that people carry balances
and not only does the merchant collect a
transaction fee then they collect
interest on the balances that people
carry so for them it's a it's a huge
boon at the beginning and at the tail
end of the transaction yes under direct
fees as well I mean not if in Britain
you buy something with your debit card
or credit card and perhaps in America as
well there is no direct fee but in many
countries there is an Australia for
example you use a contactless card you
will pay a direct fee an extra 1/2
percent or something like that and if
you use your debit card abroad I mean I
was in Russia last week I paid a hotel
bill for two hundred pound was around
two hundred pound and the card company
charged me nearly ten pound to process
that payment I mean that that's that's
quite a lot of money went in wherever
ever I go abroad now III you know take
the cash with me or I'll take a large
amount of cash out of a ATM machine as
soon as I arrive in the country well
that allows me to the next thing because
there is a risk to carrying the cash
right and so I have moved significantly
in the direction of planning ahead when
I travel overseas outside of the United
States and figuring out do I really need
to have cash with me because one of the
advantages that seems very real to me
which is worth paying to me one two or
three percent is that if I don't have
cash on me the cash can't be lost or
stolen and if I have a credit card if
the credit card is stolen I just stopped
payments on the credit
there is a program which prevents me
from being ultimately responsible for
payments that somebody else makes would
it be reasonable to say that that's
worth a few percentage points um if you
realize you've lost your card and you
can cancel you're in a position where
you can cancel it instantly that's okay
that will save you but um if you you
lose a contactless card the contactless
cards we now use in Britain um anybody
can make a purchase of up to thirty
pounds with those cards without giving
any ID without putting in a pin without
producing any kind of identification um
you're potentially gonna lose a lot more
if you lose your contactless car than if
you lose an amount of cash or or if it's
stolen I suppose it's possible but don't
I mean again I'm kind of just thinking
of thinking it through with you even if
you don't in my experience even if there
are fraud even if I haven't lost my card
but somehow somebody has you know
digitally forged a copy of my card and
made purchases even after the fact
I've never altom utley been responsible
for a payment they didn't make oh well
banks and payment companies will often
try and wriggle out of reimbursing
people in those situations and it's go I
mean I looked at I looked up some
figures the eye I found a figure and I
did this for the United States and I
also did it for Britain the number of
people percentage of people who had lost
cash in the previous year with the
percentage of people who had fallen
victim to some kind of card fraud either
having their card cloned having it
stolen having it used without permission
and these three people actually
ultimately lost money and there was no
comparison the the the percentage of
people who are losing money through card
fraud is significantly higher than those
who are losing money through cash being
stolen
so did the idea that yes theoretically
um an electronic payment a card payment
is traceable
it doesn't actually mean that police or
any other kind of Authority is actually
tracing that those payments and I don't
know how it works in America but if you
have you've lost money on a card fraud
in Britain you ring up the police they
don't show any interest at all yeah I
agree with that it's I've just never
heard of anybody needing to do that
because they were able to handle it
through through the credit card company
but I think that there's sort of like a
parallel issue here which I am much much
more concerned than some of the other
issues which we've mentioned so far
which is for me moving to cashless
moving to credit payments and and
technology based payments it seems like
it will have a the effect of
significantly increasing inequality and
what what I mean by that is that once
again we will be creating a system
whereby those who are more rural than
urban or suburb and those who may not
have the financial means or credit to
obtain some of these mechanisms will be
sort of further pushed out of certain
elements of the economy and and I think
that that really is a concern I don't
know where you weigh in on that well
that's absolutely true and I mean sort
of moving now to I'm not just sort of
system of card payments there's a lot of
payments industry trying to push us all
towards some paying with our smartphones
well you know if you've got a system
where we have to pay with our
smartphones you will first see well you
need a smart phone you need it to be
fully charged up you need some kind of
internet reception and as you say there
are a lot of rural areas which don't
have good internet coverage its
disadvantage in that the people making
the purchases and also the businesses I
mean hey how do you opera how would you
operate a business in a remote area if
you could only accept payments by um
electronic means and that's what got
smart phone ownership there's a lot of
people find it very very difficult to
use a smart phone um you look at other
bits you know the ownership of smart
phones almost Universal among young
people but in Britain um there's only 18
percent of over 65s actually own a
smartphone um makes it because people
find them very difficult to use they're
very fiddly and if you got arthritis or
suffer from other some other disability
which makes it difficult to use um I
have a daughter who has learning
disability she can handle cash she can
understand cash but to operate a
smartphone and to deal with all those
fiddly sort of apps programs whatever
you want to call them that's extremely
difficult for she's she's not going to
be able to do that and um q exactly sort
of person who will be disempowered um
through a cashless society and
governments payments industry seem quite
happy to push this drive to cashless
payments without actually considering
people like that at all thinking out
loud and this is speculative of course
are we better off trying to figure out
how to solve some of the problems you
just pointed out if we accept that there
is a certain inevitability here because
I'm sort of reminded of you know when
there was this argument made that we
really should push back against the
development of motor vehicles because
the horse buggy drivers are going to go
out of business and thinking now that
that might have actually prevented the
development of the modern automobile it
seems completely inconceivable is there
some element of inevitability here no I
think motor cars are very interesting
parallel really because you go back to
the sort of 1960s and we had sort of
predictions that you know all households
would have a motor car by 1985 therefore
we should design all our cities around
the motorcar and never mind pedestrians
cyclists they won't exist in the future
because everybody will be going by owned
by car
um well certainly in Britain car
ownership has never exceeded more than
about 70 percent of households and
that's actually falling now um you know
it's quite clicking cars motor cars
aren't gonna go away they're far too
useful for that but
you know there's no need to try to a
little bit was it a very silly idea to
try to eliminate pedestrians eliminate
cyclists from our cities because you
know give people the choice of how to
move around and you know we now know for
the environmentally point at the point
of view is extremely good thing that
people walk and cycle around and I think
you know we're in that position now with
cash and electronic payments we're at
that position as we were with cars in
the 1960s when companies and businesses
governments are saying oh we won't need
cash in future because everybody will
pay to have everything electronically
you know I that should not be allowed to
happen we you know in 3040 years time I
predict we will still be using cash in
for some forms of payment because it is
very convenient it's some cheap it's
free to use and for yeah and because it
some gives the the poor the people with
disabilities it gives them a means of
taking part in the economy which would
be very hard to achieve through purely
electronic means all right I don't
pretend to know what we will be doing in
40 years but I I'm curious to know
that's for sure we've been speaking with
Ross Clark columnist and also writer on
the spectator the book is war against
cash the plot to empty your wallet and
own your financial future and why you
must fight it I really appreciate you
sharing your point of view today thank
you
[Music]
the david pakman show at david
pakman.com so last week we had this
hearing where Donald Trump Supreme Court
nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his first of
many sexual assault accusers Christine
Blasi Ford were questioned by senators
sort of Christine Blasi Ford was
actually questioned by a sexual assault
prosecutor and then was also asked some
questions by Democratic senators
Kavanagh was questioned mostly by
Democratic senators a couple Republican
senators allowed the sex assault
prosecutor to ask him questions and then
with absolutely no explanation
whatsoever after a couple of Republican
senators had delegated their time to the
prosecutor she disappeared and then it
was just glowing remarks and really
tough questions like do you swear to god
you didn't sexually assault a woman were
what we saw from Republican senators
Christine Blasi Ford was calm and direct
and clear Brett Kavanaugh was erratic
unhinged out-of-control yelling ignition
Dignan but also contradictory up
Cavanaugh was boxed into corners
figuratively metaphorically multiple
times about whether he had blacked out
from drinking alcohol but since senators
had only five minutes with him the clock
kept running out as for example senator
Cory Booker made significant headway to
pointing out that the guy's clearly a
liar as senator Blumenthal from
Connecticut made headway and started to
expose Cavanaugh's lies on the matter
and then Republican Senator Lindsey
Graham shows up with the completely
out-of-this-world rant about these
hearings being the most unfair thing
he's ever seen done in politics ever
including to a Supreme Court nominee
which of course borne no connection
whatsoever to the real war
to the facts on the ground but most
importantly Christine Blasi Ford
answered questions and Brett Kavanaugh
avoided answering questions Vox actually
has an interesting graphic which we're
showing our television audience where
they visually show blue for answers and
red for non answers as you can see here
the top graph is Brett Kavanaugh a lot
of red a lot of non answers and then
Christine Blasi Ford answering every
question that was asked for her when it
comes to questions about investigations
Christine Blasi Ford said yes time and
again that she supports an FBI
investigation into her claims Cavanaugh
played coy saying things like I will do
what the committee wants and that an FBI
investigation won't show anything
definitive anyway but still not saying
yeah do an FBI investigation yeah and at
one point dick Durbin asked Kavanaugh
but personally do you want an FBI
investigation
I mean I'd imagine if you're falsely
accused on this this is tough on you and
you want to exonerate yourself yeah and
he just paused for 5-10 seconds he
didn't have an answer to that one and I
think he repeated one of his other
things like the four witnesses in the
room said it didn't happen or one of
these other things that he kept going
back to so let's think for a moment if
Christine Blasi Ford had comported
herself like Brett Kavanaugh did she
would have been called and out of
control not credible hysterical woman on
the basis of her behavior after the
hearings we heard that Republican Jeff
Flake big hero is calling for a delay to
Cavanaugh's confirmation vote so that
there can actually be an investigation
it seemed as though Wow Jeff Flake
standing up here doing the right thing
Republican senator Lisa Murkowski saying
she supports the delay for this
investigation
senators Jeff Flake and Chris Coons who
called for the investigation saying in
an interview last night that if any
lying is uncovered by Brett Kavanaugh in
this investigation that that's it that's
it for his nomination and that this
matters and that it's really important
that this is done that's all great
unfortunately the investigation
and may always have have meant have been
meant to be a total sham controlled by
the White House the FBI has a week to do
this so-called investigation they're not
allowed to investigate the claims of one
of the accusers Julie sweat Nick Trump
is claiming that the FBI can do
absolutely whatever it wants he tweeted
the other day NBC news incorrectly
reported as usual that I was limiting
the FBI investigation of judge Kavanaugh
and witnesses only to certain people
actually I want them to interview
whoever they deem appropriate at their
discretion please correct your reporting
except White House officials are
confirming that certain limits have been
placed here and even when it comes to
investigating the claims of Christine
Blasi Ford and Deborah Ramirez forget
for a second about the third accuser
Julie sweat Nick the White House did
according to multiple reports provide a
list of witnesses that the FBI is
allowed to interview which makes it
completely impossible to actually do a
full investigation and follow the leads
where they take you we also learned that
mark judges girlfriend who has knowledge
of Cavanaugh's friend mark judge
participating in exactly the type of
alcohol and drug riddled gang rape
situations that are at issue here
she tried going to the FBI and she was
completely stonewalled so what we have
here still is a situation that is meant
to do what in the end it's meant to push
Cavanaugh through it is meant to push
Cavanaugh through and at this point I
wouldn't even put it past Republicans to
have sort of tacitly gone along with
Geoff Geoff flakes request because they
knew that it was going to be staged as
part of the plan from day one the FBI
will come back and more than likely
since the scope of the investigation is
limited they'll say well based on what
we were able to look into here's what
the witnesses said period and Senators
will say all right we did the hearings
we heard from Christine Blasi Ford we
did an investigation let's vote and he
becomes the next Supreme Court justice I
don't hope that happens but I do still
think it's the most likely scenario I
suppose you could chalk this up as a
tiny win for Democrats getting that one
weekend
especially cuz they don't have any power
and you know they want something much
broader but this is kind of what they
could settle for but you're right I mean
it's probably gonna come back
inconclusive this happened 30-plus years
ago they'll ask some questions but
ultimately I think he'll be pushed
through the one alternative would be
that even if the specific credibility of
any particular claim can't be
adjudicated that they come back and say
the guy did lie during the hearings and
that would be another story and we'll
talk about that in a moment but to talk
about Kavanagh this is a man who's
fundamentally at the base level unfit to
be on the Supreme Court regardless of
the sexual assault right and then you
remember oh wait he's been accused of
sexual assault by at least three women
that we know about specifically so far
so this is a sham it in dangers the
future of the United States as we know
it and aside from the allegations and
the unhinge rants Cavanagh many times
about small things throughout the
hearings lied Bernie wants a perjury in
VEX investigation and that's exactly
what I want to talk about next let's
focus in now on lies while under oath by
Brett Kavanaugh we already talked about
how he straight-up didn't answer many
questions during that hearing where we
heard from Brett Kavanaugh and from his
first of many accusers Christine Blasi
Ford we already talked about the fact
that many times
senators started picking apart his
claims that he never blacked out from
drinking to the point where he might not
remember what he did on some nights we
already talked about how his sort of
baseline unhinged nature makes him
fundamentally unfit to be on the Supreme
Court but now I want to focus in on lies
that he told remember senators Jeff
Flake and Chris Coons who called for
this investigation last night said if
any lying is uncovered that's likely the
end of this nomination for Brett
Kavanaugh so this matters okay it's
really important to understand that
Cavanaugh is lying about lots of little
things and that should disqualify him
from being on the court even if it's
each individual lies small or relatively
unimportant it's still against the law
to lie under oath and it still makes him
a liar people who know Cavanaugh are
flooding out saying he lied he
many times during the hearing every few
hours there's a new article with people
who know him saying this was a lie that
was a lie
Cavanaugh lied so much actually that
it's hard to even know where to start
but let's first start with his claim
about getting into Yale part of Brett
Cavanaugh's unhinged ranting on Thursday
included him saying that he got into
Yale on the basis of his hard work and
that he had no connections to Yale
whatsoever he his exact words that day
were a quote senator you were asking
about College I got into Yale Law School
that's the number one law school in the
country
I had no connections there I got there
by busting my tail
in college this is a lie Brett Kavanaugh
was a legacy admission to Yale meaning
he had prior family members who went to
Yale his grandfather
Everett Edward Cavanaugh went to Yale to
little lie it's one of many but why is
he lying all the time and why do we need
to excuse those lies he claimed that a
Devil's Triangle is a drinking game it's
not other than references added from a
congressional IP address to Wikipedia
after his hearing he knows that it's a
sex act involving two men and a woman
and it's yet another lie he claimed that
the term bouff related to flatulence
which it doesn't Cavanaugh knows that it
relates to anal sexual practices he
implied when talking about his drinking
that he was of legal age by saying you
know in 1982
I drank beer 18-year olds could drink so
the seniors could drink legally that's
right the seniors who were 18 could
drink legally he wasn't 18 at the time
it's a small lie but it's yet another
lie and then there's kind of like the
bigger narrative lies okay
Cavanaugh's broader story was I just
didn't drink enough to forget stuff I
didn't drink enough to have foggy
memories despite the fact that Senators
Booker and Blumenthal and others made a
Klobuchar and others made some pretty
significant progress in showing that
that wasn't true but before and since
Cavanaugh's testimony a bunch of his

plan to watch it later it was widely
reported in multiple media outlets that
he was watching the testimony the fact
that Cavanaugh lied so much about so
many little things is actually
indicative of his they can't touch me
attitude which he shares with who he
shares that attitude with Donald Trump
when you were this willing to perjure
yourself you should not be on the
Supreme Court you really shouldn't have
any government job private companies are
free to decide Pat do they care about
the fact that this guy lies all the time
or not he really shouldn't have any
government job and as I said before it's
not likely that there's going to be a
perjury charge proven here it's unlikely
we're even going to get a perjury charge
but at least one senator is getting
tough on the crime of perjury by Supreme
Court nominees and that's Bernie Sanders
who has now actually written a letter to
Chuck Grassley who's been running this
entire circus of a confirmation hearing
saying the FBI should investigate not
only the claims of the accusers but also
whether the guy lied whether he perjured
himself and in his letter Bernie Sanders
said in order for this FBI investigation
regarding judge Bret Cavanaugh's
nomination to be complete it is
imperative the bureau must not only look
into the accusations made by dr. Ford
Deborah Ramirez and Julie sweat neck
which they're not doing by the way it
should also examine the veracity of his
testimony before the Judiciary Committee
obviously Bernie also points out that
they should investigate the claims of
all three women they're not doing that
either Julie sweat Nick attempting to
get in touch with no luck I would make
the case actually that perjury
allegations or may be more damaging than
the sexual assault allegations not that
lying about what booth means is worse
than raping a woman that's not what I
mean
but what I mean is no matter what the
FBI comes up with with regards to sexual
assault it's still gonna be a
preponderance of evidence thing and more
than half of Republicans as I'll tell
you later don't even think sex assault
should disqualify you from the Supreme
Court in that sense if you perjure
yourself it's much more cut-and-dry
Republicans will still say I don't care
put
on the court but I actually think that
you you can make the case that being a
sloppy drunk in college isn't
necessarily disqualifying from being on
the Supreme Court lying about it
constantly as an adult under oath
however should disqualify you from being
on the court it's all just so hard to
prove though like when he claims that
Boo f---ing related to flatulence not
anal sex or The Devil's Triangle that's
a drinking game not a sex act I mean in
his circles he could claim that that's
what those terms meant you can't just
cite urban dictionary and say there's a
discrepancy here or you know I mean his
classmates will come out and say that
this guy drank a lot in college right he
was intoxicated every Friday and
Saturday night him it's it's
unbelievable to think that he could
remember some of that stuff well hey if
he says that he didn't black out how are
you gonna prove otherwise
and when it comes to perjury it does
involve whether he was deliberately
saying something that wasn't true or
whether he genuinely is just mistaken so
it's an uphill battle but I agree with
Bernie that the lying has got to be
investigated here send me your thoughts

you join them at WWJ impact mancom get
the bonus show the commercial free audio
and video streams of the show all that
great stuff and the pleasure and
satisfaction of knowing that you're
supporting independent media ok there's
one more angle to the Brett Kavanaugh
Fiasco that I do want to talk about
today despite the fact that Brett
Kavanaugh was clearly lying during the
hearing with his accuser Christine Blasi
Ford last week despite the reality that
we all should understand that this guy's
completely and totally unfit to be on
the Supreme Court it's still very
possible that he will be the next
Supreme Court justice but there might be
I'm like really looking for some kind of
silver lining or upside here there might
be an upside to that happening before
the midterm elections in just five weeks
which is that there's a new poll which
claims that voters will punish their
senators if they vote to confirm
Cavanaugh there was a poll conducted by
change research which says that 51% of
voters are less likely to reelect their
senators to vote to reelect their
Senators if they vote in favor of
confirming Brett Kavanaugh 50% also said
that they would view the institution of
the Supreme Court as less credible if
Brett Cavanaugh is confirmed
these aren't overwhelming numbers it's
like a very slight majority within the
margin of error but the point is that
when control of the Senate hangs in the
balance for Republicans when there are
many races that are going to be really
close there's a risk if you're a senator
who votes to confirm Brett Kavanaugh if
you're up for re-election that the
voters who are going to vote for or
against you are not going to be pleased
and in fact this is a time when the
campaign finance system we have
should be used to our advantage and what
I mean by that is I think the campaign
finance system we have as a disaster you
know that if you pay attention to this
show but right now this is the system we
have money should be raised immediately
millions by a super PAC that will do a
blitz of ads targeting senators who are
up for re-election in November and who
vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh I want
to change the system we have
but right now use that system to do
something good
gather as much money as you can build up
the war chest this week so that as soon
as the vote happens the TV ads can start
immediately your Senator Lindsey Graham
voted to confirm accused serial sex
assault or Brett Kavanaugh to the court
vote him out this November because we
know Republicans don't care about the
sexual assault and I have a poll that
will tell you that in a second but if
there is going to be something that
could kill Cavanaugh's nomination it's
not going to be the moral outrage over
what Cavanaugh did or didn't do we know
they don't care about that it's going to
be Republican senators that want to keep
their seats
if the polling starts to show that their
seats are in jeopardy if they vote to
confirm Brett Kavanaugh you actually
might see some Republicans say well hold
on a second here hold on a second here
Jeff Flake is retiring right but all of
a sudden you have other Republicans who
are running for re-election if they
think a confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh
will make them lose their seat they will
oppose him because you know what in the
end Trump's gonna get a different person
up there
Trump's going to get someone in there
that is the way that you might be able
to prevent Cavanaugh from getting on the
court I mean 50 percent or so saying
that they would be less likely to
support their senator for re-election
that doesn't sound all that promising
but you have to remember that's
nationwide right so if you take a look
at the states that have a Republican
senator but they're more left-leaning
like Maine with Susan Collins or Alaska
with Lisa Murkowski I think that's where
you have a chance because it's not 50
percent there it's probably
significantly higher that's exactly
right
and this is the way if if there is a way
forward to successfully block this
nomination it's going to be the people
that Pat name's Susan Collins Murkowski
this is a really bizarre story I don't
really know any other word for it we've
talked about the sort of macro insanity
of the Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault
story we now have multiple allegations
against him from Christine Blasi Ford
from Deborah Ramirez there are
allegations that Cavanaugh was involved
in plying women along with others with
alcohol in order to as a pretext to the
possible a gang rape of these women he
made a very strange statement where he
said he definitely wasn't at the party
where Christine Blasi Ford was allegedly
almost raped but how would you know you
weren't at that specific party if it
didn't happen and you weren't there is
none of it really makes sense right
that's the macro of it so anyway we're
waiting on the hearing to see what dr.
Ford has to say to hear Brett
Cavanaugh's defense senators have been
sort of working out exactly when it's
going to be and in the middle of this
Republican Senator Chuck Grassley
appears to have accidentally tweeted
something that he meant to text to Brett
Kavanaugh Grassley is 85 years old he's
the chair of the Senate Judiciary
Committee meaning he's running the
confirmation hearings for Cavanaugh to
the Supreme Court he's running the
scheduling he's making decisions about
what's happening when and late on Friday
close to midnight Eastern Time on Friday
he tweets the following quote judge
Cavanaugh I just granted another
extension to dr. Ford to decide if she
wants to proceed with the statement she
made last week to testify to the Senate
she should decide so we can move on I
want to hear her I hope you understand
it's not my normal approach to be
indecisive this doesn't really read like
a normal public tweet that a senator
would deliberately send at midnight it
reads more to me like this was supposed
to be a private text message to Brett
Kavanaugh at the same time Grassley does
tweet in generally confusing and unclear
ways so like here's another example of
Grassley's shorthand that he has used in
tweets he once tweeted quote five times
now we've granted extension for dr. Ford
to decide if she wants to proceed with
her desire stated one week ago
that she wants to tell the senator story
dr. Ford if you changed your mind say so
so we can move on I want to hear your
testimony come to us or we to you so on
the one hand it does seem like his first
message was meant to be like a private
text to Brett Kavanaugh on the other
hand particularly for an 85 year old guy
who was not necessarily raised in the
era of social media shorthand he does
seem to regularly use some pretty
consistent shorthand everything about
this story is bizarre down to the
communications between Grassley and
Cavanaugh yeah he looked into the
character count on that first tweet yeah
it was 272 just eight character shy of
the 280 Twitter limit yeah so that
suggests to me that he wrote it up and
then had to delete some characters and
so maybe he thought he was tweeting but
that's that's not something that you
want release with the public that's
something you tell someone one-on-one
yeah yeah maybe he thought it was a
direct message I don't know there's so
many questions here do you think he's
direct messaging with Brett Kavanaugh
that would be even more shocking it may
be this is the transparency we've been
waiting for like instead of
communicating with Kavanaugh privately
Grassley does it through public Twitter
posts just directed at Kavanagh and as
far as the subject matter in Grassley's
defense although he might be sort of
stumbling around in the dark
technologically he does actually seem to
want to get the hearing done with the
Cavanaugh accuser
but he wants to get it done merely to
say we did it we we heard from her and
now we're ready to confirm Brett
Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and of
course we now have even more information
to suggest that that's what they want to
do because we learned that last week
they were notified about the existence
of a second accuser Debra Ramirez and
instead of saying stop the presses
stop this from going forward we've got
to go back to the drawing board and
investigate all of this stuff
Republicans instead said oh we've got to
hurry up we've got to hurry up and get
Cavanaugh approved for life to the
Supreme Court confirmed for life before
this blows up in our faces now I want to
give you one example of what I mean when
I say Republicans don't care what
Christine Blasi Ford says they just want
to say we heard from her now we're ready
to move on Republican Senator Lindsey
Graham Graham says it doesn't matter
what she says he's not going to change
his
the hearing hasn't happened but he's
saying the content of it is irrelevant
he said on Fox News Sunday yesterday
quote you can't bring it in a criminal
court you would never sue civilly you
couldn't even get a warrant what am I
supposed to do go ahead and ruin this
guy's life based on an accusation I
don't know when it happened I don't know
where it happened and everybody named in
regard to being there said it didn't
happen there's a huge difference between
ruining his life and simply saying he
shouldn't be one of nine appointed for
life judges on the highest court in the
land right that's not the same thing I
can't ruin his life by not buying him a
Lamborghini well there's a difference
between ruining someone's life and not
getting them the luxury sports car that
they want right and the point is the
Republicans who want the hearing don't
want it because they might hear what dr.
Ford has to say and then decide you know
what I can't vote for this guy they want
to do it just so they can check the box
say they did it and move on to confirm
confirming him I don't think any
Republicans are willing to change their
votes
yeah and Lindsey Graham is making it
seem as though we're prosecuting
Cavanaugh and they're proving these
allegations beyond a reasonable doubt
sure that's not what the standard is
here it's just weighing it out out in
the court of public opinion and among
those 100 senators who will vote to
confirm and making a decision as to
whether they are comfortable giving this
guy a job for life deciding the most
important legal cases out there period
for the United States for as long as he
wants to be on the court the answer is
clearly no we actually have other news
related to Brett Kavanaugh as well a lot
of Brett Cavanaugh stuff today so we
talked about the background earlier just
now about sexual assault allegations
against Brett Cavanaugh we had Christine
Blasi for to come forward allegations
from high school we had Deborah Ramirez
come forward allegations from college
about forcing his penis into her face
and and forcing her to touch it without
consent we now have learned about an
individual named James Roche James Roche
was Brett Cavanaugh's roommate at Yale
in 1983 during the time that the Deborah
Ramirez incident allegedly took place
and James Roche has now given an
interview and put out a statement
and what James wrote says is not good
for Cavanaugh he says quote basically
that he believes the accuser sang quote
we shared a two-bedroom unit in the
basement of Lawrence Hall on the old
campus despite our living conditions
Bret and I did not socialize beyond the
first few days of freshman year we
talked at night as freshman roommates do
and I would see him as he returned from
nights out with his friends going on to
say it is from this experience that I
concluded that although Brett was
normally reserved he was a notably heavy
drinker even by the standards of the
time meaning college freshmen in this
this in the early eighties and that he
became aggressive and belligerent when
he was very drunk I did not observe the
specific incident in question but I do
remember Brett frequently drinking
excessively and becoming in coherently
drunk this is important because
Cavanaugh denies drinking to this degree
now as far as the accuser Debbie Ramirez
James Roach again this is Cavanaugh's
college roommate went on the record and
in a statement said quote she stood out
as being exceptionally honest with a
trusting manner as we got to know one
another
I discovered that Debbie was very
worried about fitting in she felt that
everyone at Yale was very rich very
smart and very sophisticated and that as
a Puerto Rican woman from a less
privileged background she was an
outsider her response was to try hard to
make friends and get along how could it
be that so many people are now saying
that Brett Kavanaugh either did certain
things or is exactly the type of guy who
would have done certain things when he
had 65 girls who knew him in high school
who said he's just a great guy now he
did go to an all-boys Catholic school
it's weird to me that 65 girls knew him
well enough to make statements on the
record about exactly what kind of a guy
he was that's a little bit odd but we
can skip over that right now because I
want to sort of circle all of this stuff
Pat back to something that is really
important that has been forgotten
because of all of these sexual assault
allegations which are important the
story about his tens or hundreds of
thousands of dollars of debt related to
baseball tickets is still out there and
it's really a concerning situation I
forgot all about that stuff it feels
like it happened a
years ago the story is important and I
don't want you to let the sketchy debt
story go away
because of the sexual assault stories I
don't want the sexual assault stories to
be ignored because of the perjury stuff
but the sexual assault can be more
easily shrugged off by Republicans by
saying as they will accusers sometimes
lie it's been a long time
these are smears it's a smear campaign
the $200,000 in sketchy baseball ticket
debt can't be explained away as easily
and it's also a much more complicated
story to figure out what it is that
Brett Kavanaugh actually was doing it is
extraordinarily shady but almost
nobody's talking about it anymore and if
you've forgotten about this or never
knew about it to begin with Brett
Kavanaugh had a bunch of debt that was
sort of mysteriously and very quickly
paid off in advance of his 2017
financial disclosure his claim is that
he was buying baseball tickets for
friends on his credit cards and that
then his friends would pay him back and
that he had racked up a ton of debt on
the credit cards but he was paid back lo
and behold by the time he filed this
2017 financial disclosure the debt was
completely gone but does that really
make sense to anybody because it's very
weird that a guy who is not rich at the
time based on his net worth it doesn't
really make sense that he'd be amassing
these tens of thousands of dollars on a
rolling basis adding up to a couple
hundred thousand dollars in credit card
debt reportedly for baseball tickets and
then it all goes away
and we don't know how and it just
absolutely stinks and it's the
sexual-assault stuff is important if he
perjured himself it's important but
there's been no reasonable explanation
for this debt being paid off either yeah
and there were plenty of other judges
conservative judges that Trump could
have picked and I wonder if you know the
sexual assault allegations and maybe to
a lesser extent the baseball ticket
stuff will be a reason for Senate
Republicans to pull the plug on Kavanagh
sometime soon and rush through someone
else I don't think it's their call see
that's the thing the what the
Republicans seem to be doing is
trying to move full speed ahead senator
corn and put out a statement yesterday
saying that if nothing new comes from
Thursday's hearing they're gonna vote on
Cavanaugh Cavanaugh in committee and in
the chamber before adjourn in Friday
that's like three days from now so I
think that as long as Trump doesn't say
we've got to pull them as long as
Cavanaugh doesn't say I'm gonna go away
because it's becoming a distraction I
think the Republicans are sort of
committed to just trying to get him
through and I think for them part of it
is they don't want it it's horrible that
it's become this toxic but if they don't
get Cavanaugh through they won't see it
as this was a bad guy who lied had very
weird debts that were paid off suddenly
and had multiple sexual assault
accusations against them they will say
the Dems won they prevented us from
appointing this guy they get a win we
get a loss even though you shouldn't
want an alleged serial sex assault or on
the Supreme Court so I think that if if
no one else pulls the plug Republicans
are going for it yeah there are some
political pundits saying that if
Cavanaugh is rushed through despite all
of these allegations not getting heard
yeah then he will always have an
asterisk next to his name as a Supreme
Court justice what does that matter in
the end I mean he's going to be able to
serve on the court for what 30 40 years
and that this stuff's not gonna matter
and it's not gonna affect his decision
made only a lifetime appointment Pat
what are you worried about now I do have
to bring this up because the audience
will crush me if I don't did you say
astrick I was thinking about how to
pronounce this word ahead of time and I
still couldn't get it right so yeah if
you want to slam me on that it's fair
game and there's actually one more did
you say pun dent or pundit I think I
said pundit okay let's let's play back
the tape yeah let's do it over let's
roll it back do the entire story over
and cut that out we'll do an overdub
after we go to commercial make sure
you're following the show on instagram
at david pakman show make sure you were
following me on instagram at david
pakman you know who joins me next this
is someone I've been looking forward to
interviewing for a long time you said
we've been working on it since April
since April of 2018
astronaut I guess I have to say retired
astronaut scott kelly is going to join
me he spent a year on the International
station he has a twin brother Mark Kelly
who is of course the husband of former
Congresswoman Gabby Giffords who was
tragically shot in that incident several
years ago now Scott Kelly is going to
join me next I hope you will stay with
us for this one even those of you who
don't love the interviews because I'm
really looking forward to it and I hope
you are as well quick break back after
this I've got for you today the most
cringe-worthy completely bata moment
that any American president in the sort
of modern era of audio-visual recording
has experienced Donald Trump was laughed
at not laughing with but very clearly
laughing at by the entire room of world
leaders at the United Nations General
Assembly yesterday Trump showed up and
he tried the stuff that he says at
rallies of supporters but instead he was
in a room full of world leaders and it
did not go over well what's the phrase
it went over like a lead balloon this
video is so embarrassing
that I almost I'm and the key word is
almost I almost feel bad for the guy but
I don't okay and what Donald Trump did
in the video I'm about to play for you
is he tried to claim that he has
accomplished more in his first two years
as president of the United States than
any other administration in American
history period which is quite a big
claim right you could say we're on track
to do the things I said I would do which
of course would also not be true or some
way make it a less bold statement it's a
ridiculous claim as he made it and the
room made him know that it was
ridiculous
to the point of being literally
laughable settle in for this prepare
yourselves this is what it looks like to
be a total beta on the world stage if
you're allergic to cringe don't watch
this if there are kids in the room get
them out because this is really bad
let's take a look today I stand before
the United Nations General Assembly to
share the extraordinary progress we've
made in less than two years my
administration has accomplished more
than almost any administration
in the history of our country America's
so true
didn't expect that reaction but that's
okay
yes III am like almost feeling slightly
bad for the guy but but I'm not and just
nobody in the room takes him seriously
he's an actual laughing stop stock he is
the literal laughing stock of the
world's leaders and he's talked before
about the United States and the
presidency being laughed at by the world
he was wrong he was talking about Obama
take a listen to this the world is
laughing at us folks they're laughing at
us at our stupidity they laugh at us
laughing at us it's just crazy what's
going on everybody's laughing at us
they're laughing at us
we don't know what we're doing think
we're stupid the whole world is laughing
at us laughing like this that's what's
going on in our country yeah the world
laughs at us folks the world laughs at
it's so funny because I don't remember
laughter at Barack Obama during the
eight years he was president I remember
some laughter with him because he was a
very good speaker and he was able to
very quickly build rapport with with the
audience but now they actually are
laughing at him the entire world is
laughing at Trump world leaders are
laughing at Trump I was just all over
Europe spoke to people in so many
different countries in Europe they are
laughing and scared everywhere and it's
all fun and games and Trump's a
but this is actually more than that
because it's not just Trump it's also
people around him right apparently no
one explained to Trump the dynamics of
speaking at the UN nobody thought maybe
we don't want to put this up on the
teleprompter because when Trump said I
didn't expect that reaction it was
actually like a genuine honest moment
from Trump he really had no idea that
that's how a roomful of world leaders
would react to such a dumb hyperbolic
and unbelievable claim to just laugh at
the absurdity of it and there's a really
interesting other sort of psychological
question which is how is Trump going to
rationalize this after the fact
I saw you an ambassador to the UN nikki
Haley on Fox News I don't even want to
play it for you because it's so so
unbearable but she said something like
oh no they were laughing with him and
they were laughing at the thing he said
after the thing and everybody respected
him and everything I don't even want to
play that people
because it's so dumb I mean that
response would make sense if he was
cracking a joke when you laugh with
someone but that was a serious statement
that he made he was completely serious
and more than likely Trump will say that
people were laughing with him or it was
sort of a brothers-in-arms situation we
all say this stuff we get you good one
Trump he might go on a tirade against
the entire room although it's less
likely in this case because it is the
leaders of basically every every country
around the world this is actually
I'm joined today by Laci green who is a
sex educator youtuber author of sex +
learning loving and enjoying your body
so much to talk about Laci up maybe a
good place to start is you were raised
Mormon and no longer are talked about
that a little bit because we've talked
to former Mormons who have had sort of
different paths out of Mormonism like
what was your path like um well when I
was about 12 years old I don't know how
much she know about Mormonism but pretty
early on they split you up by gender yes
and I would say that that was around the
time that I started realizing that there
were things about the church that made
me feel uncomfortable mostly coming back
to the gender stuff I think that in the
Mormon religion there's a really strong
adherence to gender roles and that was
really a lien ating to me as a kid cuz
you know I was I was kind of like a
tomboy I did not like all this like
crafty let's talk about babysitting and
you know it was just like a weird it
just struck me as weird as a kid and I
think that's kind of what started my
exit out once I realized that there was
a lot of misogyny in how the church how
at least you know the church that I was
a part of conducted itself
yeah and correct me if I'm wrong but
like one of the main pillars of
Mormonism is that and again my you'll
correct me I'm sure I believe that there
is it 12 apostles who can only ever be
men right yeah and the leaders can only
be men and you know when you're a kid
when you're you go through puberty as a
girl they tell you that your spiritual
role on earth is to have babies like
that is what you do that it's the most
divine capacity that you have and I just
think that's really sexist you know like
I'll just be really frank about it
telling telling young girls but their
greatest spiritual value lies in their
ability to have babies is a really
messed up thing to tell girls of course
it's great if you want to have babies
and it's beautiful and it is powerful
but that's not all that girls are you
know that's where
it started to trip me up a little bit so
did you first express these hesitations
to your family did they were they taken
aback by your eventual leaving yes I
fought with my parents constantly as a
teenager you know probably starting
around thirteen or fourteen and told
them how I felt about it and told them
that I think it's sexist and told them
that I think you know a lot of this
stuff is it doesn't make any sense there
is a lot of weird stuff about sex like
masturbation is strictly off-limits and
I would have to go in to go to the
temple in the church you have to go talk
to one of your church leaders a guy
privately and he like asked me all these
questions about if I masturbate and like
how I touch myself and there's all this
weird yeah weird weird it's like that
shouldn't be this shouldn't be like a
regular process in the church why why is
it seen as normal for young teenagers to
go talk about their sexuality with these
weird old dudes I don't know it's just
rubs me the wrong way and I told my
parents and they got very defensive
about it but you know we're on better
terms now yeah well we're going to ask
about that like is is leave you know
leaving Scientology has a very specific
meaning where is like unless you're in
the most Orthodox Hasidic Jewish
communities leaving Judaism is almost
like a non it just doesn't mean I need
there's no reason I think whatsoever
that it'll have any impact on your
relationship with your family where does
leaving Mormonism sort of rank on that
spectrum can you still maintain the same
relationships or almost the same with
your family I think it depends on the
family with mine absolutely I'm very
close to my family you know we we have
very very close relationships and
they're healthy relationships for the
most part so I think you know it would
be it's possible if my parents were not
that cool that we would be estranged
because of that I dunno Mormon kids ex
Mormons who have been estranged but
there's no like official guidance where
you need to disown not that I know of
anyway you need you to send someone for
leaving the church so what I find super
interesting about
was that as you just described your
initial sort of hesitations concerns
about Mormonism were heavily related to
gender and what you perceive to be and I
would agree with you are sexist and
misogynistic sort of policies or or
ideas and in your earlier work on
YouTube and and on other platforms you
had a very sort of particular feminist
perspective and over time I think it
might be fair to say that you have had a
sort of political awakening or maybe we
would call it a realignment of sorts is
that fair to say I can see why it looks
that way in the public but I would say
that I feel all the same things I've
always felt I just say more interesting
so what give me an example of that
because so for people who maybe aren't
familiar with you as as much of my
research shows which you're free of
course to dispute you have maybe moved a
little more away from the feminist side
and maybe are finding more value in some
of the anti SJW anti-feminist milieu of
the Internet is that fair I don't think
that's accurate good I'm glad we can
talk about that I do not agree in any
capacity with anti-feminists okay and I
don't agree in any capacity on anything
substantive with the anti sjw crowd
okay good side that said here's where I
think we're getting to the key part
that's it yes
I I think that there are plenty of smart
people in that crowd I think that their
arguments are worth addressing and have
more nuanced than sometimes people give
them credit for good and where I do
agree with them this is probably the
only thing we agree on and why I become
really good friends with a lot of people
that move in that sphere is that I also
agree that the way that social justice
stuff is carried out sometimes is really
toxic and bad oh yeah okay so you and I
are completely on the same page as far
as that goes that okay cool yeah I mean
when I like really sit down and I talk
to people about this stuff people who
have been angry
about things they've seen about me
online or whatever usually we agree it's
like I didn't change my mind I'm not
like less of a feminist I don't think
the anti feminists have like good points
or something I haven't changed my mind I
feel just as strongly as I always have
however I think that there are some
crazy people on the left like there are
some very Wow some really wild stuff out
there and when you say that lacy are
there particular is it is it just the
people and the way they couch their
argument or are there actually specific
claims or arguments being made on the
left that you hear and you say I just
simply don't agree with that I'm sure
there are arguments being made that I
don't agree with I I so I guess one of
the main ones is like some of the some
of the criticisms that are made about
the way that identity politics are used
the way that they're employed I think
there are pros and cons to identity
politics obviously the entire feminist
movement is about women's identity you
know female identity so I don't think
that identity politics are bad will sail
but I do think some of this like more
inflammatory clickbait be weird stuff
that people do with identity politics is
really causing a lot of harm and
alienation of people who could be allies
to these causes who otherwise agree but
are being told oh you're like this
you're white male you know straight
white men you're trash you're garbage
things like that it's just like why do
you have to do that I don't understand
how prevalent is that like I I basically
I'm on board with what you're saying
with the exception that I can probably
count on only one hand and I'd probably
have fingers left over for messaging
that is straight up like straight white
men or garbage like I'm just not seeing
that and that my feeling from the
research I've done is that it's vastly
overblown that that exists how serious
of initiative you think that perspective
is on the left okay I used to feel the
same way that you did until I really
started waiting in talking to people
about this kind of stuff in a more
holistic capacity I guess and I do think
it's a problem I do see a lot of it
online
I don't think that that is like the most
pressing issue I think it's silly that
people are so defensive about what some
random egghead on Twitter said you know
but I also think that the discourse that
kind of discourse is becoming it has
become more commonly accepted it's
become a way to signal you're woken asau
the people and to show other people how
progressive you are you know the virtual
virtual signalling stuff that people
talk about I think that's a real thing
and I am also annoyed by it
I think it's obnoxious and unnecessary
and for me it makes it hard to connect
with people on the ground when about you
know feminism sexism whatever when their
first exposure to this stuff is from you
know some really inflammatory comments
online and obviously that's I agree with
you it's not like widespread it's not
like a defining thing within progressive
movement but I think that it has become
acceptable to acceptable and I do think
that that kind of stuff has become too
common online especially because you
identified that there are some people on
the right that are very very smart
people and I'd love to not that I don't
agree with that but I'd love to get that
list from you do you get a sense that
the alt-right recognizes that often
while critiquing identity politics they
are effectively an identity movement do
you do you feel like they understand
that or do you think that definitely
missing from from their understanding of
what's going on I don't I don't think
they understand that they're doing the
exact same thing that they are not at
other people for doing that's the
hilarity of the alt-right the white
identity stuff it's like you know you
guys are identity politicians as well
like you're out here you you're mad
about feminism you're mad about black
lives matter and yet you're doing like
this weird white lives whatever you know
it's just it's all it's all the same
thing of course the white life stuff is
different in a very critical sense
because they're not marginalized you
know these are people who don't have
real systemic barriers yeah I spoke
about that I don't know if you've been
following this him to hash tag thing I
spoke about it yesterday on the pro
and you know I find that what's missing
from the conversation about if you can
have a me-too movement then you can have
a hem to movement about men who are
falsely accused of sexual assault or if
there's an LGBT Student Union then why
is it not okay to have a straight
student unit and I feel like what's
missing from the discourse is the
historical understanding of why these
groups have sort of surfaced in the
first place and whether they've served
the stout of good faith or in bad faith
I don't know how to have that
conversation successfully with people on
the right do you know how that you can
broach that issue I have had that
conversation but I think that for some
people they don't care about the context
because they don't really fully
understand the context I think that's
really what it comes down to you like a
lot of people are removed from the
history of these issues and you know why
as you said why things are the way they
are now and why be the context is
everything here I don't know how to
impress upon people the importance of
context either acknowledge that that is
a really important part of the
conversation or you leave a huge aspect
of the conversation out which is how we
got here in the first place
I find that frustrating as well I wanted
to touch base with you about the sort of
relative importance of different issues
today and there's a big debate right now
not about the substance there there is a
debate about the substance of many of
these issues like gender pronouns for
example or the me2 versus the hymn to
movement or whatever but then there's
also a conversation about what issues
should actually be prioritized in 2018
so is there an issue right now that you
think is getting way more attention than
it actually deserves but then also on
the other hand are there issues right
now that should be getting much more
discussion that aren't really being
talked about mmm that's a good question
I think there's probably too much focus
on feminist media on the media like on
representative media and stuff which I
do think is important and I do think
that it's important to you need
do you sort of critical thinking about
the media that we consume and the types
of messages that are in it okay I do you
think that's important but I think it is
disproportionately paid attention to and
people fight about it way like they
would invest a lot of time and energy
into fighting about that particular
issue and to make sure I understand what
is you do mean whether particular
identities are represented in the news
that but also you know is this new
Netflix show properly feminist oh god
you know was this comment that
such-and-such celebrity made problematic
you know just like things that I would
that you have to ask yourself okay what
are we gonna get out of this on a
societal scale by investing a huge
amount of time and resources into this
one issue right and I don't think that
it's proportionate I don't think that's
a good the most pressing issue of our
time I do think it's important like I
said I don't want people to like of
course people are gonna take me out of
context either way but yeah I do think
it's really important and I do think
that there is tremendous value in those
conversations but I also think that
there are there are very serious issues
at stake right now in our country and
with regard to women particularly we are
having reproductive rights completely
roll back I mean it is jarring to me
what's going on and what's been going on
for a long time but now here we are with
all his cabinet stuff and we're in a
really really vulnerable and precarious
position right now with regard to
reproductive rights
sex ed birth control just everything
relating to sexual health and freedom
and I mean there has been stuff because
there has been stuff online because of
the cabinet stuff but before that I just
don't really feel like anyone really
talks about abortion or talks about how
these things are happening it's almost
like it's not a sexy enough issue I
think that when a comes down to is that
when it's about legislation that's being
debated it has to reach a much higher
threshold of salaciousness before it
will enter the dialog then for example
someone like Jordan Peterson saying
I'm being forced to or will be punished
for using this or that gender pronoun
and I think that that's the issue in
general that you're kind of describing
which is that the media coverage that
develops around personalities on these
issues seems to be much more powerful
than the actual legislation around those
issues which could affect way more
people directly absolutely you said it
perfectly well that's exactly how I feel
and I think that something that
frustrates me is that there's not enough
recalibration there is within
professional activists or circles but
just you know the mainstream sort of
feminist movement people who are talking
about this stuff online as a hobby or
interests I think they don't pay enough
attention attention to the things that
really matter and the things that are
really gonna have the most direct effect
on people's lives you know another
example is the health care to be it's
happening in the u.s. if people
literally can't afford to survive then
what good is defending the perfectly
constructed feminists narrative in a
movie you know like I just priorities
that's how I feel about it we've been
speaking with Laci green who is a sex
educator youtuber also author of sex
Plus learning loving and enjoying your
body Laci really great to talk to you
today you do David thanks for having me
it is great to be joined today by Scott
Kelly who's a retired astronaut veteran
of four space flights commanded the
International Space Station on three
expeditions also a member of the
year-long mission to the International
Space Station which we'll talk about
Scott thank you so much for talking to
me
my pleasure so where to start I mean I
think you know so many kids say I want
to be an astronaut when I grow up so I
guess a good place to start is what what
actually made you want to be an
astronaut well I'm not the typical kind
of person that became an astronaut I
wasn't the best student in school I
struggled never really did well
graduated from high school in the bottom
half of my class and then when I went to
college I was kind of having the same
experience I didn't know how to study I
couldn't pay attention eventually I'm
like barely even going to class anymore
and then one day I'm walking across the
college campus and I go into the
bookstore to buy like gum or something
not a book but I see this book on this
shelf and it's got this really cool like
red white and blue cover it's got the
cool title made me pick it up look
through it and turned out the book was
the right stuff by Tom Wolfe and I felt
like I could really relate to the
characters in this in this book I don't
know if it was because Tom was such a
great writer or you know I really did
have something in common with these guys
but I felt like they were like normal
people like me but with one exception
and they were accomplished students and
graduated from college with degrees in
science and engineering and I thought
you know I could do that that one part
maybe I could fly in the air play an
airplane in the Navy or or be a test
pilot someday or maybe even be an
astronaut so you know for me I to
summarize that I was this kid no one
would have expected to have this
privilege to do this but due to some
inspiration I found as an 18 year old I
was able to go pretty far how would you
characterize the importance of your
engineering background versus your
background in piloting right whether
it's the military test pilot etc is it
is it 50/50 what goes in to doing the
work you've done as an astronaut is it
more one versus the other well you know
as a test pilot in the military you're
really what's called an an engineering
test pilot which means you're both an
engineer and pilot of a flight vehicle
and the Space Shuttle was very much a
white test vehicle it had never even at
the end of its lifetime it had never
flown many flights so every time we
would fly it we were investigating new
things so you know I violated the Space
Shuttle I docked it with the
International Space Station I landed it
but I was also also very much you know
served in a role as a as an engineer I
would say as far as importance on the on
the space shuttle yeah my my skills as a
test pilot and piloting I think was you
know the one that was the predominant
[Music]
skill I guess you could say that helped
me do the job on the space station maybe
it was more like as an engineer because
the space station is not very much it's
not really like an airplane it's more
like a ship maybe that happens to be in
space so you know you're more of a
handyman and the you know the repair guy
I am the spacecraft the engineer times a
scientist so I think you know the
engineer skill was probably more
relevant you talk in your book endurance
about the challenges of long-term
spaceflight the effects on the body
there's the psychological impact of the
isolation you have this particularly
interesting circumstance where you have
a twin brother
who can be compared physically and maybe
we can learn from that about more
specifically what some of the physical
effects are of spending as long in space
as you have what information do you have
so far I've been following how you've
been undergoing all sorts of different
testing to figure out exactly what was
the impact of spending so long in space
what interesting sort of tidbits do you
have so far about the sort of most
important impact of spending that much
time in space well you know science is a
process and science that the government
does is a longer process generally for
an experiment that's conducted onboard
the space station it takes about five
years from you know the conclusion of
the data collection to publication
there's a lot of data analysis generally
they don't have as much time pressure as
if you're a university research or doing
something in the commercial industry so
you know they take their time they have
things peer-reviewed which is normal and
then publish that it takes a while but
you know some of the results I've heard
about you know cognitively you know my
cognitive ability kind of went down
right after I got back from space hmm
maybe like solve complex problems I
think I was probably just due to the
fact that I really didn't feel well for
a while because of the you know the
effects gravity has on ER our physiology
as we come home yeah can you talk about
that maybe in a little bit more detail I
mean we know that it's common that when
astronauts first get back the impact of
coming back to gravity is significant
you spent a year in space so how long
did that last and like how do you
experience it I would say you know
before I felt absolutely back to normal
was probably about eight months Wow you
know the majority of it in the beginning
you get through dizziness the nausea the
flu like symptoms the stiffness the
soreness the rashes and hives I had
where my skin had not touched anything
for so long the
swelling in my legs which was probably
the worst thing yeah that all kind of
dissipates over over time to get back to
your original question though about the
experiments you know one other thing
that was there's a few things that
compared to my brother we're interesting
our microbiome is different and you know
those people that are familiar with
science microbiome is all the bacteria
that lives inside of you generally in
your gut and there's more of them than
there are us we have more bacterial
cells that live inside of us than we
have of our own cells so and a
microbiome has been discovered to be
very important in different various
aspects of our health with disease and I
you know it's more just interesting to
me that mark an eyes microbiome were not
the same which is because a lot of what
kind of microbiome you have has to do
with your diet and particularly where
you travel around the world where you
live what type of you know bacteria
you've been exposed to the other ones
that got a lot of attention was my
telomeres got better our telomeres or
these end caps on our chromosomes that
as we age they get more afraid and
damaged and shorter and that's an
indication of our physical age so the
hypothesis was I would go to space a lot
of radiation stressful environment my
telomeres we get shorter compared to my
brother's but in fact they got better
and longer so you know it doesn't mean
space is like gonna be some Fountain of
Youth or anything it just means that
there's some something going on there
that they need to understand better yeah
often in the Loray I don't know if
you're familiar with longevity
researcher aburrida gray a lot of his
research is focused on the importance of
telomeres and that that seems absolutely
fascinating that the at least in the
early results it seems that what
happened was the opposite of what was
hypothesized you know it's always a good
experiment when your results are the
exact opposite of what you thought would
happen so yeah so
yeah like I said I don't think it's
gonna be a fountain of youth but it's
interesting to see maybe how much
control you can have over your telomeres
with Hill diet and exercise despite the
harsh environment you're living in and
then the the last one that got a lot of
attention was the how 7% of my gene
expression change and as compared to my
brother's actually more than that change
but when we got back still seven percent
of my genes and G your genes for your
listeners are not your pants they're
here your DNA RNA and protein and how
they behave has a lot to do with who we
are and what diseases we get all kinds
of things so gene expression is one of
these pieces of DNA RNA or protein
either turning itself on activating or
deactivating turning themselves off and
they don't know what these genes control
so in some cases this might be a good
thing maybe a gene turned on that would
prevent me from getting some kind of
disease sure or maybe a gene turned on
or off that would cause me to be more
likely to get that so we don't really
know much other than the fact that
there's a you know a physiological
phenomenon going on where that this
environment affects us at a genetic
level when it comes to some of the more
sort of day-to-day things that you
experience on the space station like for
example the the weirdness of the arms
hanging at your sides calluses on your
feet going away when you sleep you don't
have that experience of sort of taking
all the weight off because you're in
zero gravity all the time is that stuff
more impactful psychologically or is it
the physical side because I imagine that
the psychological impact of all those
things every single day for a year would
start to sort of wear on you it's more
the physical it is okay especially with
the carbon
on the space station they have to deal
with it it varies throughout the course
of the day and depending on how the
hardware is working depending on how
many people are on board maybe even how
many animals might be producing carbon
dioxide if you let's see had a lot of
mice and also depending on how the
hardware is working to get rid of it so
you know there are two physical things
about being in space for a long time
that would be great to be able to do to
get rid of them one like I just
mentioned the carbon dioxide the other
one is the fact that all the fluid in
their bodies have in the absence of
gravity just kind of redistribute you
know how our you know wherever our
hearts pushing them yeah well what that
means is when you get the space all of a
sudden your head is swollen
you know the rap song big-headed
astronaut not it's just it's not about
our egos you know that's about like I
think physically your head swells up and
even after a year it never quite goes
back to normal so you feel like you have
this pressure in your head which you do
and it's not pleasant not for I mean
it's it's not something that's you know
over time it gets better it's not
absolutely horrible but it's not great
that's a good place to pause we're
speaking with retired astronaut scott
kelly we will pick it up we'll talk
about his book endurance his time on the
International Space Station and much
more we're continuing our conversation
with retired astronaut scott kelly
veteran of four space flights commanded
the International Space Station on three
expeditions including being a member on
the year-long mission Scott I want to
talk a little bit about the future of
space exploration and space travel more
generally this has become quite
political either for better or worse I
would argue for worse you're we
currently have a situation where there
is more and more debate around should we
be funding organizations like NASA
should the future of space exploration
be led by the government or by private
industry or both can you give me like a
general
of where you see this debate right now
you know I haven't heard much of about
it much of a debate should we fund NASA
I haven't read that NASA is generally a
pretty well supported government agency
that very bipartisan support people
generally like the space program now
they don't necessarily want to spend as
much money on it as NASA would need to
do some of the things we're asked to do
but you know by and large our budget has
continued to increase over you know
since the end of the you know Apollo
program granted we don't we we don't get
as much money as we used to but you know
our budget has been not subject to the
cuts that other government agencies have
had now having said that you know it's
always great to get more money and then
there is this argument or you know this
I wouldn't even go as far as say it's an
argument I mean we are in a partnership
with private industry nASA has given
SpaceX billions of dollars to build
their transportation systems to the
International Space Station NASA as a
part of that SpaceX has been able to
take that money and do some pretty
incredible things
so this government private partnership
which way do you go or flying people in
space you go both ways
you know SpaceX Boeing companies like
that I think will soon be providing
access to low Earth orbit NASA will be
you know developing a transportation
system to go deeper into space now
depending on how much money we give NASA
to do this will depend on what we get
and when we get it and I think probably
at our current level of funding I'm
gonna take a long time you know we're
not going to Mars anytime soon we could
if you wanted to pay for it but you know
I think the public
you know likes to government to use
their money in a you know for the most
part in a you know in a methodical and
reasonable way and you know they're not
willing to cut Nana a check for fifty or
a hundred billion dollars a years so
this is gonna be a slow process but you
know I don't think there's a whole lot
of argument going on about whether we
supply in space and whether NASA is the
better than SpaceX I think at least the
people that are familiar with the
industry know that there's a place for
you know public government-run
spaceflight and also a new place for
privately run companies well you know
along these lines when you hear about a
space force as a way to spend money in
space but not in the way that an
organization like NASA would would
normally be spending money what occurs
to you what what is your thought about
that
well you know the space force idea I
don't even know where they came from
exactly came from the President himself
maybe from some advisors people often
confuse that term with NASA including I
think maybe even the president mention
space words at the same time NASA
doesn't have anything to do with this
space force which doesn't even exist
yeah nor do they want to I mean this is
a government organization that is was
created for peaceful purposes for the
exploration of space
my understanding of space force is
you're basically taking a capability
that the US Air Force already has and
then you're creating this huge
bureaucracy around it to support it
because you're pulling it out of the air
force and somehow this is a good thing
creating a new bureaucracy to arguably
you know
one of the largest bureaucracies in the
world at the Department of Defense so I
you know I don't it doesn't make any
sense to me if it was up to me and
someone asked me hey we want to create a
new branch of the Armed Services I would
say well if we really want to do that
and we think it's necessary I would I
would create the cyber cyber force
before the space force I mean it seems
like that is our bigger immediate threat
than threats in space although we do
have them I mean we do have a there's
always a potential for an arms race in
space and that's something we need to
take very seriously but if we needed a
new you know a military branch clearly I
think cyber would be a money better
spent or do you consider yourself a
political guy and I ask that because
you're very diplomatic in your answers
but it's also very very clear what it is
that you're saying and of course you
know your brother husband of former
democratic congresswoman Gabby Giffords
and has become very active on the gun
violence front I mean do you do you see
yourself as a political person you know
I would like to the problem I have is
that I'm so much of an independent and
you know I really couldn't have any
success you know there are issues that
more in line with the Democrats there's
other issues are more aligned with the
Republicans and unfortunately the way
our political system is is designed you
know especially in Congress with a
gerrymandering you know changing these
political districts to support one party
or you know how people raise money with
you know citizens united where companies
can pay you know unlimited funds to
elect their candidate for a guy like me
kind of in the middle is it's not a
really good spot to have an impact I
think in there in our political system
so you know sometimes I would
like to think of myself as ice
definitely have opinions yeah but
they're not in line with the you know
the mainstream of both of our major
parties you know I think they're things
we could do to fix that if we decided to
if our country ever decided a we want we
want a government that more represents
you know us you know let's get the
corporation's out of it let's even in
some ways get the political parties out
of it a little bit I would like to see
people vote for candidates what versus
you know a party know about the people
you're voting for maybe you know states
need to consider laws where you don't
have the the party the candidates party
on the ballot
yeah in fact there are low there are
municipalities within states that have
done that and it it seems to actually
work pretty well because you can't just
show up and check off whatever party it
is you voted for last time and it'd be
an uphill battle to do it at the state
level but I'm completely on board with
you as far as that goes yeah some people
just Duggal the ruler job because they
think they're a Republican or a Democrat
and they don't really even know you know
it's just like kind of weird identity
politics where they identify with one
group without even really knowing what
that group stands for what that person
stands for yeah so yeah then go back to
your original question I follow politics
I like it it's interesting to me but I
don't think there would ever be a place
for me because you know I'm too much of
a independent and finding lead anchor
maybe last thing I wanted to ask you
about and I've heard astrophysicist Neil
deGrasse Tyson deal with these types of
individuals what is your approach to
those who believe conspiracies like we
never went to the moon there's a Flat
Earth insert whatever right when it
comes to science and that it relates to
your field is there any value to
engaging with those individuals or is
time better spent working on other
things let them let them believe what it
is they want to believe and leave it at
that you know that's a tough question
you know my first inclination is to
laugh
make a joke you know that generally
doesn't help the situation especially if
people really really believe in in these
types of conspiracy theories I think I
welcoming back to the program today John
guandolo who's a former Marine and FBI
agent who now runs the organization
understanding the threat strategic
operational training and Consulting on
the threat of the global Islamic
movement John it's great to have you
back not only because the FBI has become
such a topic of of newsworthiness over
the last few years but also just because
it's great to follow up with with folks
we've interviewed we had you on back in
2013 and at the time you talked to us
about how you believe that then CIA
director nominee John Brennan had been
recruited by Saudi Arabia and converted
to Islam now that he has come and gone
do you still stand by that do you
believe John Brennan was secretly or is
secretly a Muslim
well we know uh as a matter of fact from
my own sources who were in Saudi Arabia
when John Brennan was a station chief
that he said the shahada and the
presence of Saudi officials including
mabaheth Saudi intelligence officials we
now have retired station Chief from the
CIA Brad Johnson who has now come out
publicly and said it was well known and
is well known in the CIA that John
Brennan converted to Islam and he had
heard that for many people who had
Direct knowledge and heard things direct
from uh from Mr Brennan so I don't think
that that is a a question
anymore although some people would try
to make it so so yes obviously stand by
my comments why don't you think that
it's been reported in any sort of
investigative news Outlet or or
corporate Media or even really in much
Independent Media that that the the
former CIA director had inverted to
Islam but sort of kept that secret why
that seems like it would be a story that
would be uh for for the media Outlets
that make money from getting clicks and
so on wouldn't they want to publish such
an explosive story why wouldn't they
I would think so but I think there are
many uh what I would call explosive
stories that aren't being published
certainly not by what I would call I'm
going to use the term mainstream media
since I think many of your viewers will
know what I'm talking about but the
typical ABC NBC CBS MSNBC CNN uh Fox
News that they're not covering this
story but I would also say he was not
the only CIA station Chief in Saudi
Arabia that converted Islam now let me
ask you this John because I want to see
if we can Define some of those terms
like when you say so you said he he
recited it's the shahadas I hope I'm not
speaking incorrectly it's the shahada
that he recited correct yeah so like I
I'm putatively Jewish right if I go to I
don't know a Catholic church and get
baptized
Catholic might say David pakman is is
now Catholic but if I didn't really do
it in a serious manner if I don't
identify as Catholic doesn't really
matter that I was quote baptized right
like that wouldn't make me Catholic any
more than if I just right now recited
the shahada would so are you do you
agree with that or do you believe that
something
irreversible sort of happens when you
say a certain thing or or if I were
baptized
right well I think the premise your
question is not uh quite right so if you
uh first of all you would not be allowed
to be baptized in the example you gave
in a Catholic Church unless uh you had
gone through uh as an adult if you had
gone through a certain uh process that's
that's set up for you to be to begin
your initiation into the church so
um no you're not Catholic because the
process would would include baptism and
uh your your uh
confirmation and communion sure but then
the same thing applies I mean if I did
it and didn't really do it in a serious
way that that's what I feel in my heart
I'm just going through the motions am I
really Catholic
well so we can step away from talking
about Catholicism uh the answer is it's
not a the answer is actually uh you
don't get to do those things uh unless
you understand what you're doing uh in
full faith in Islam the law because
Islam is a totalitarian system governed
by Sharia a law uh yes if you publicly
say the shahada
um under the circumstances that the law
requires then you have accepted Islam
and have converted and that's all it
requires and if you read what Islam
teaches you are not required to
understand what the fullness of sharia
requires they only are required to tell
you enough so that you come into Islam
without uh and I would argue that many
people uh are not aware that leaving
Islam as a capital crime so they only
give you enough which is is exactly the
opposite of how for instance again
staying with your example Christianity
uh treats it that when you come into the
full communion of the church you know uh
you were taught the full body of what
the faith is in Islam uh they're not
required to tell you they tell you
enough to get you to say the shahada
they're thereby you are a Muslim and
once you're in you can't leave so let's
uh let's play it out now let's say
Brennan Brennan was a secret Muslim uh
what I observe take place under
Brennan's stewardship and under
President Obama were drone strikes and
bombing of multiple majority Muslim
countries uh significant military action
against Isis did Brennan as a secret
Muslim do anything as a result of being
Muslim in your estimation
well he certainly supported I mean we
could start with today and we're back
but I'll I'll bounce around to answer
your question I mean he supported the
U.S Muslim Brotherhood uh both uh
through the actions as the
counter-terrorism adviser to the
president and as the CIA director by not
only appearing at uh Muslim Brotherhood
functions and promoting them and
Advising the president to promote them
such as the Islamic Society of North
America and others
um he the the policies if we look at
what happened under President Obama if
you look at the leaders around the world
that
um were really the only leaders that
were putting the boot on the Muslim
Brotherhood uh Muammar Gaddafi in in
Syria Assad
um Mubarak in Egypt the Obama
Administration removed Mubarak had
Gaddafi killed and is trying to remove
Assad so that that should be noteworthy
I mean Muammar Gaddafi was killing more
Al Qaeda Fighters than anyone else on
the planet at the time so I think that
is the problematic because the who they
were targeting were those who were uh
um honestly enemies of the United States
in other words uh
Gaddafi Assad Mubarak and I'm not
defending those three individuals but
what they were doing were keeping the
global Islamic movement uh specifically
the Muslim Brotherhood at Bay and we
basically ripped those down and now we
see the results of that but as a seek I
guess I'm confused because as a secret
Muslim wouldn't Brennan's involvement in
uh an escalation of the droning of um of
Muslim individuals be something that
according to his own secret religion
Islam would send him to hell like how
why would he agree to participate in
that why would he further that policy
that we saw escalated under Obama
right well my first question to somebody
asking my first answer to somebody
asking that question is what Islamic law
have you read
and if you read Islamic law it's very
clear and when they're when you see
Muslims in conflict with other Muslims
it's always a
it's always about one of two issues uh
matters of sharia or power
and so if we're going to look at the
geopolitical relationships between Iran
Saudi Arabia Iraq uh other nations like
that what happened in Libya what's
happening in Syria you have to
understand Sharia and you have to
understand the power struggles and so
Sharia does provide uh for these things
and again it's going to be one of those
two things it's going to be matters of
sharia and matters of power and you've
got both going on right now in the
Middle East so if I'm understanding what
you're saying to kind of like tidy it up
uh anything that John Brennan did as a
secret Muslim CIA director that appears
to be
anti-muslim was actually in furthering
the interests of a power struggle in a
way that would be sanctioned by Sharia
law and would not condemn him to hell
uh if he were actually operating
according to Sharia now his loyalties
based on just if we just look at what we
can visibly see and and I want to be
clear you're using the phrase secret
Muslim secret society I'm I'm saying he
said the shahada he didn't seem to be
secretive about it uh he's never been
asked by the media directly about it
which is a little shocking since now
like I said six or seven months ago
you've got a retired very successful
station chief of the CIA and and others
but is it shocking though maybe that
maybe just no one because I remember
last time we talked you had said I think
it was your wife who speaks Arabic who
heard Transmissions about it but that I
think for a lot of so-called mainstream
media might not be sufficient evidence
to say that John Brennan converted to
Islam you know
well I that was not me that said that I
don't have a wife that speaks Arabic but
um I will say that uh when you have a
station chief of the CIA saying that it
was well known in the agency that he had
converted Islam I think that's a very
powerful statement and the fact that the
media ignores that I can't
subscribe to why they would do that yeah
it's weird all I'm saying is if you look
at Mr Brennan's actions he clearly
supports the Muslim Brotherhood the
president of the United States was
advised by Mr Brennan both as a CT
advisor and as the CIA director director
of Central Intelligence openly supported
the Muslim Brotherhood against a sitting
leader in in Egypt Mubarak who was
keeping the Muslim Brotherhood at Bay
and now after that Revolution that we
supported that overthrew Mubarak now
there was the counter-revolution and we
have a non-muslim Brotherhood government
we see the Muslim Brotherhood locked up
we see stability back in Egypt but the
point is yeah what we see is and what we
saw were Mr Brennan's actions were
pro-revolutionary uh and pro-supportive
of the Muslim Brotherhood so that's I
mean those are just facts on the table
that I would I can't imagine that
anybody could dispute it as well well
John in the limited time we have left uh
as a former FBI guy how do you assess
Robert Mueller's handling of the
trump-russia investigation
well since uh as of today there is no
evidence that uh the president United
States
um in any way
took actions with a foreign government
that affected U.S elections as a matter
of fact it's the opposite uh Mrs
Clinton's campaign uh definitely did as
a matter of fact they supported the fisa
application that went to a fisa court
which had information that was uh
objectively untrue and omitted
information that would have brought
significant question to that fisa
application that was submitted and by
the way hold up John I have to interrupt
though I have to interrupt
um isn't it true that there is
substantially more evidence to support
Trump Russia collusion than John Brennan
being a Muslim right I mean you've got
the Trump Tower meeting you've got the
indictments guilty please well like
what's your standard of evidence for
saying that it's obvious that John
Brennan's a secret Muslim but there's no
reason to even look into Trump Russia
collusion how do you come to that
conclusion
I didn't say there was no reason not to
look into it if there are real
accusations and real basis of fact right
now there is not one fact on the table
that Mr Trump uh worked with the
government of Russia which is the the
accusation in order to affect U.S
elections there is no evidence of that
that's not true if you believe his
attorney Michael Cohen he knew about and
went forward with a meeting with Russian
agents in Trump Tower specifically to
receive information from them meant to
be damaging to Hillary Clinton to
improve his chances of winning the
election now you might say it hasn't
been proven in court yet that's fine but
that's a specific allegation at this
time that's being investigated it's an
allegation that's unproven there is no
evidence on the table Mr Mueller himself
if you look at what he's put on the
table that are facts that we can grasp
onto that is not one of them that's on
the table well Mueller is running an
investigation his job is not to make
public all the evidence he has he's he's
running an investigation right you were
you were at the FBI you know that they
don't make the public aware of every
piece of evidence they have that would
be that wouldn't make any sense
of course not okay I agree with you
there but the fact is there is we do not
have evidence that Mr Trump colluded or
worked with and specifically worked with
a foreign government any foreign
government in order to affect the
elections when in fact there is a
substantial amount of evidence that Mrs
Clinton did among among other things
I mean the fact that she and and it
appears that the president United States
now with the evidence that is as an
investigator that we can't say for sure
but there is a lot of evidence that
points to the fact that Mr Clapper Mr
Brennan and the president himself knew
that that fisa application went in with
information that was knowingly false to
spy on U.S citizens including a
candidate for the president United
States which is in violation of federal
law
okay unfortunately we can't adjudicate
that right now but I do appreciate John
guandolo former Marine and FBI agent
giving our audience uh an update on
where he is on the Brennan Muslim issue
and also on the Trump Russia
investigation John appreciate you taking
the time to come back and talk to us
thank you and I appreciate your time to
speak with you thank you
[Music]
the david pakman show at david
pakman.com this is just gross but
probably not a shock
Republicans are defending Donald Trump's
Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh
against the sexual assault allegations
that are plaguing him at this point not
by saying he didn't do it
but by saying that if he did it it
really shouldn't matter that much
because it was a long time ago anyway
and of course this ignores the fact that
if he did it even a long time ago he's
still actively lying about it now so the
question is are you saying that we
should ignore both that he assaulted
someone a long time ago and that he's
lying about it today or are you saying
that we simply don't know what it is
that happened because those are two very
very different positions for Republicans
potentially to take and then more
importantly who believes that it
shouldn't matter because it happened a
long time ago legally yes we have
something called the statute of
limitations that may have passed based
on the alleged acts that took place but
if I told you hey I've got a great
babysitter for you she did steal from a
family she babysat from once but it was
a long time ago and the police weren't
called anyway so it's not like she was
ever actually charged with a crime do
you ignore that and you say well listen
it happened a long time ago I'm glad to
hire her to babysit my kids today or do
you say no we it doesn't matter that
legally she's not going to get in
trouble I'm not hiring her as my
babysitter I think most of you know the
answer and this by the way isn't hiring
somebody for one night it's giving
somebody a job for life
Republicans are okay with the boys will
be boys type of thinking the locker-room
talk to take a phrase out of Donald
Trump's vocabulary silly attempted rape
that failed
anyway I mean come on hormones and stuff
right
attempted rape only matters for Supreme
Court candidates if they did it recently
like is that actually the position that
these Republicans are taking and there
was a time I know it's hard to remember
now because of where we are there was
actually a time when Republicans had bad
economic ideas but they were it totally
failed people as individuals they are
now genuinely hypocritical bigots who
value ignorance and value
anti-intellectualism
over morality and some semblance of
intelligence and critical thinking and
this doesn't even really appear to come
down to whether Republicans are willing
to accept Cavanaugh's lies and put them
on the court anyway this actually
violates the rules of integrity for
judges and for lawyers these rules vary
from state to state and from federal to
state and depending on the body that
you're talking about and of course these
are guidelines it's not the law but some
version of a rule that says if as a
lawyer or a judge you engage in conduct
involving dishonesty fraud deceit
misrepresentation or the appearance
thereof you are not fit to serve period
this is super cut and dry
you don't even actually have to
adjudicate the sexual assault
allegations because of the other lies
but in total there are two possible
answers here this is like
multiple-choice it's very binary either
their position is that it's okay for
Brett Kavanaugh to lie previously and
possibly now and just make him a judge
for life anyway or you have to take the
position that lying is not okay and that
lying under oath is not okay
and it's illegal and you shouldn't
appoint such a person to the Supreme
Court period and even if you want to
defend Brett Cavanaugh's actions when he
was in high school or you want to say
well listen at the time it was a long
time ago we don't know exactly what
happened and even if he did it his brain
wasn't fully formed and the hormones you
can defend the
actions as a high-schooler legally and
say we're gonna let it go
legally statute of limitations of course
having expired anyway but you don't have
to put the guy on the Supreme Court for
life and make him one of the nine
highest judges in the land and we're
quickly learning that this is one of the
most despicable nominees to the court in
decades and also I don't know if you saw
this but Brett Kavanaugh put out a
really strange statement saying that he
wasn't at that party
how does Cavanaugh know that he wasn't
at the party at which supposedly
Christine Blasi Ford was the subject of
an attempted rape how does he know which
party that would be if he wasn't at the
party like is he saying I didn't go to
any pool parties anywhere that entire
year that's how I'm sure or is he aware
that there was an alleged rape at a
particular party but he's claiming he
wasn't they like it's the weirdest way
to try to exculpate yourself the excuses
don't work whatsoever and it's weird
because this is maybe something that
Kavanagh could get beyond because he was
under the age of 18 and you know many
people understand that people in their
youth make mistakes certainly doesn't
excuse it but he could still be
nominated and appointed and approved to
the Supreme Court despite that but you
have to tell your story and you have to
be straight with it you can't get away
with all these lies no and this
statement it reminds me of mr. Cavanaugh
do you know who killed this man officer
I have no idea who strangled that guy to
death strangled mr. Cavanaugh I asked if
you knew who killed him
I didn't mention anything about a
strangulation how do you know that he
was strangled right no no no I had
nothing to do with it and I wasn't at
the party at which she was attempted
were at which she suffered an attempted
rape very strange way to defend yourself
and maybe we'll learn more about it at
some point for months I've been telling
you that this relationship between
right-wing FoxNews radio host and
television hosts Sean Hannity and Donald
Trump is very very bad news for America
and we know that sometimes Sean Hannity
is the last person Donald Trump speaks
to before going to bed Hannity sort of
tucking Trump in proverbially speaking
colloquially speaking we know that
Hannity has become just a blindly loyal
supporter of Donald Trump's pushing just
any old Trump friendly narrative on his
TV and radio show that that comes to
mind or that someone suggests to him no
matter how outrageous it is and we know
that Trump is impressed with these
strongman types in politics like Putin
and erawan but we also know that he
seems to be equally impressed with the
strongman types like a powerful media
figure such as sean hannity so this
relationship between Hannity and Trump
had disaster written all over it from
day one and we've now learned that
Donald Trump recently ordered the
declassification of sensitive documents
because Sean Hannity among others told
him that he should do it there have been
Trump's about there have been reports
about how Trump recently told the
Justice Department to go ahead and
declassify materials related to the
Moller investigation which is absurd for
a few reasons including that Trump is
part of what's being investigated and
he's the last guy that should be saying
what should or shouldn't be declassified
related to that investigation Trump
wanted FISA warrant applications
released related to Carter page who we
recently interviewed he wanted FBI
reports about interviews with Justice
Department officials Declassified he
wanted messages sent by James Comey
about the Russia investigation
Declassified really a ridiculous request
and a terrible idea especially since it
could expose intelligence sources and
methods that are being used by the FBI
so Trump was interfering with an ongoing
investigation by merely requesting the
release of these documents he was
possibly endangering American security
interests again he was jeopardizing once
again relationships with allies who
might see this and say wait a second why
are we going to share information with
the United States if Donald Trump might
willy-nilly ask for that information to
be Declassified at any time that's what
we knew so far so Trump then gets
interviewed this week by the hill and he
said you know I actually haven't even
looked at those documents but people I
respect like Sean Hannity and cuckoo for
cocoa puffs judge Jeanine Pirro said
have these documents Declassified and
released so I did it
but I didn't even look at the documents
myself here's a transcript from the
interview that he had with buck Sexton
where buck Sexton says have you reviewed
the memos yourself what do you expect
them to show if so and then Donald Trump
responds and there's an ellipses here
because there was some other stuff in
between these these two sentences I want
to be very clear about that Trump says I
have not reviewed them I have been asked
by many people in Congress as you know
to release them I have watched
commentators that I respect
begging the President of the United
States to release them I have been asked
by so many people that I respect please
the great Lou Dobbs the great Sean
Hannity the wonderful great Jeanine
Pirro it would be bad enough if Donald
Trump was personally dictating policy
but instead the people he listens to our
dictating policy and one of those people
is Sean Hannity another one of those
people appears to be wacky judge Jeanine
Pirro and there are White House aides
who are now referring to Hannity as the
unofficial chief of staff because of the
influence that he seems to have over
Donald Trump I want you to think just
for one second let's all do this little
exercise sit back and imagine this for a
second it's announced that Barack Obama
has ordered the declassification of
documents that could expose the
identities of ten CIA agents working
covertly for example confounding
decision why why would you release
something like that and then a few days
later a George Stephanopoulos interviews
Barack Obama and Obama says honestly I
don't even know what the point of it was
I did it because Anderson Cooper told me
that I should really release these
documents just to pick someone can you
imagine the outrage 24/7 on right-wing
media on Hannity on Rush Limbaugh on the
entire entire thing if Donald if Barack
Obama had done that and the double
standard here where Trump says listen
people I respect judge Janine Hannity
they said release the documents no I
didn't look at
because they told me to release him I
don't even know what it's all about
Obama would be destroyed if he had done
something similar yeah but we don't get
that sense of outrage when Trump does it
because we're so used to it we're so
desensitized to it and I feel like in a
way Trump wanted to declassify these
documents all along but he knew that it
would look bad in the public eye if he
did this because after all the
investigations into him right but does
it look better to say Hannity told me to
do it he's trying to say other people
encouraged me to do this yeah people
like Congress people and media figures
like Jeanine Pirro and Sean Hannity I
wouldn't be at all surprised if Hannity
gets pulled further into the Moller
probe because of his degree of contact
with Trump he's provided a platform for
Trump to push his lies in the apologia
about Russia he's tied directly to
Donald Trump's indicted former personal
lawyer Michael Cohen it would not be
even an iota surprising to me if Sean
Hannity ends up being a bigger figure of
interest in this entire fiasco send me

technocracy as well as Freudian slips a
couple interesting discussions from the
David Pakman show subreddit which you
can find at david pakman.com slash our
edie di t more than 7000 david pakman
show viewers and listeners now
participating I mention it to you
because we want to foment robust
community and conversation on that
subreddit note rolling though we have
moderators trolling not allowed there
was a post about technocracy saying
david what's your opinion on technocracy
title says it all here's hoping he's
going to read it well I did read it and
this is something I'm interested in so
first let's start with what is
technocracy when we talk about
technocracy we talk about a government
or control of society or control of
industry by a sort of elite of technical
experts who basically see governance as
an engineering problem so there are some
obvious pros to a technocracy number one
we put people in power who know things
instead of people who are professional
politicians or mostly lawyers which is
what we have in American politics today
at least at the national level so if you
have people who know things you would
think that that would be a positive
change in government government when you
have people who are actually subject
matter experts the problems with
technocracy are number one who decides
who the experts are because if I said
let's put in experts on climate science
to actually work in government the right
will line up a long list of people they
say are climate science and climate
change experts would we agree that these
are the experts on climate science and
climate change no we would not so that's
one problem with technocracy who decides
who the experts are number two experts
in which fields right how do we decide
which fields are the important ones for
governing and then there's an important
question that's sort of like a
chicken-egg question or a causation
correlation question are lots of
politicians lawyers because you need law
knowledge to be a politician or are lots
of politicians lawyers because being a
lawyer makes you better suited maybe
because of how you've been taught to
think for example to be a politician
along the same lines we might have
Tech's expert tech experts and
scientists elected as politicians
elected officials not because they need
that technology to do the job of being a
politician but because their background
in science their background in tech
maybe the argument would go makes them
better suited for the types of thinking
that elected officials should be doing
the answer probably is like most things
a gray area you don't want a total
technocracy you want a balance right now
we have way too few people from tech and
from science in government and
particularly at the federal level but at
the same time you don't want to go
completely overboard and get people from
other disciplines out of government what
we we can say with certitude is just
having lawyers run government is not
something that has served us
particularly well over the last many
many decades also from the David Pakman
show subreddit somebody pointed out
that I had a Freudian slip when I did
the show on was it Monday or Tuesday
Tuesday where I was talking about Donald
Trump's Supreme Court pick and I said
the following and Pat Pat noticed it as
well we have had yet another major
development in the confirmation of
Donald Trump Supreme Court prick pick
Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court prick I
actually didn't even notice it when I
said it even though I corrected myself
that's interesting it went totally over
my head and it reminded me I think I I
don't remember all of the Freudian slips
that I've had on the David Pakman show
but one of my absolute favorites is this
one from over a year ago which I'll play
for you today Republicans Mike Lee and
Rand Paul voted against approving those
sanctions even Ted Cruz and Mitch
McConnell Freudian slip guys Mitch
McConnell excuse me uh Wow we have to
just continue right I mean let's you
have to keep going we'll edit that out
don't worry about it maybe the most
important element of this well we didn't
edit it out and I think that that
probably is the most notorious Freudian
slip on the show right what was going on
with that hair to seem so so different
yeah I know it's weird like I'm not
aware of having changed my hair for ten
years and I look back a year and I'm
like what on earth was going on at the
time it's very odd anyway thanks to
everybody who's participating daily in

EDD i.t Donald Trump is now calling the
FBI quote truly a cancer in our country
when I read it I actually thought you
know Richard Nixon probably felt the
same way towards the end there he
probably would would have had a similar
point of view about the FBI the FBI is
not an objectively perfect or even
delightful organization there's this
really sort of complex dynamic that's
developed where merely by defending the
fact that the Trump Russia investigation
makes sense you have some on the Left
attacked four haphazardly supporting
such a dark institution as the FBI or
the CIA and supporting every bad thing
every Intelligence Agency has ever done
so let's start at the obvious the FBI is
not objectively great as an organization
it is an intelligence security and law
enforcement agency it's part of the
apparatus of so-called justice in the
United States it's run by people people
make mistakes
it has scandals it makes errors it's not
infallible
it's what I'm trying to say but it's
mere existence in and of itself isn't
the problem
much like the existence of the House of
Representatives isn't the problem the
problem is that much of the House of
Representatives has been overrun by
right-wing ideological lunatics so the
FBI is the FBI and allowing the right to
frame the FBI at a sort of institutional
level as the problem is problematic and
allowing the left to be framed as blind
haphazard defenders of the FBI is also a
problem because the FBI has done bad
things so that gets us to this week
Donald Trump did an interview with the
hill TV Hilda Hilda TV I guess it is
Donald Trump said during that interview
that the FBI's quote truly a cancer in
the fallout from Bob Woodward's book
about the Trump White House continues
and today I want to focus in on comments
from Gary Cohn who's a former economic
adviser of Donald Trump's who says
according to Bob Woodward's book this is
pretty full on that Donald Trump has the
IQ of an inbred tanning bed which is
really a nice comedic touch because just
saying he has the IQ of a tanning bed is
sort of funny and it maybe is a
connection to Donald Trump's fake
tanning which he is so known for but
adding the touch about the inbred
tanning bed really puts it over the top
for me and this is now not merely
anecdotal that's really the story for me
the people who stopped working for
Donald Trump and don't have some
personal interest in not disparaging him
sometimes they're party to
non-disclosure agreements that they
choose to abide by although sometimes
they choose to ignore them or those who
are not hired to be Trump apologists so
Corey Lewandowski Trump's former
campaign manager sort of famously left
Trump's World Organization campaign
administration whatever and went on CNN
but he was hired as the Trump guy so he
wasn't going to go on and say bad things
those who just leave and say what's on
their minds seem to say really bad
things about Donald Trump including that
the reality is way worse than what the
public knows and that's exactly what
Gary Cohen who was part of the Goldman
Sachs wing of the Trump administration
is saying according to Bob Woodward's
new book Cohn was the director of the
National Economic Council for Trump for
a little while and he was reportedly
stunned by how ignorant Trump was
starting from day one
Trump has according to a cone and from
what we know a pretty fundamental
misunderstanding of basic economics and
even of how money works remember that
phone call he made to one of his
national security advisors Michael Flynn
to ask him about whether the dollar
going up
down was good for the United States and
Gary cones anecdotes about Trump's money
knowledge are truly amazing cone told
according to Bob Woodward cone told
Trump that the Fed was probably going to
be increasing interest rates during
Donald Trump's first term and Trump
allegedly said we should just go borrow
a lot of money hold the money and then
sell the money for more and we will make
money and Cohn explained to him no no if
we borrow money that increases the
deficit and you said you wanted to get
rid of the deficit to which Trump
responded just run the presses print
money according to Bob Woodward so the
trend is Trump is ignorant his first
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called
him a
defense secretary Jim mattis according
to Bob Woodward told close associates
that Trump quote had the understanding
of a fifth or sixth grader former White
House deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh
reportedly said that working with Trump
was quote like trying to figure out what
a child wants I don't even know that I
agree because you can usually figure out
what the child wants it doesn't seem to
be clear what Trump wants and Scott
Pruett the EPA director said in not so
many words that Trump has effectively no
understanding whatsoever of both the
Constitution and the rule of law Pruitt
one of the most corrupt and vile members
of trumps administration even sees the
absurdity of what he's dealing with with
Donald Trump and now you have Gary cone
saying that Trump has the IQ of an
inbred tanning bed there are two kind of
parallel levels of debate or discussion
taking place right now on the right
within the right you're starting to see
some people engage in a debate with
trumpets about whether Trump truly is or
isn't qualified to be President that's
actually kind of a win like just the
fact that we're seeing some Republicans
say okay i Hillary's a disaster I hate
Hill
she's evil she should be locked up
whatever but Trump may not be qualified
to be President but I'm still a
Republican and I want a Republican to be
President the left is beyond that we're
now mostly exploring on the left whether
Trump is qualified to I don't know run a
car wash and I don't want to insult car
wash owners I think the answer is
clearly no Trump's not even qualified to
run a car wash and car wash owners
likely are more qualified than Trump to
be President they probably have some
basic understanding of how money works
Breaking Bad I guess would be one
example of that but the this is
alternate universes we're seeing this
fork this divergence where on the right
were desperate to see even just a few
introspective critical comments about
listen maybe this guy shouldn't be
president whereas on the Left we're
saying this is a crisis of monumental
proportions we are going to continue
scaling up our coverage of the 2018
midterm elections as we get closer and
closer now seven and a half weeks away
and what I want to talk to you about
today is that there is a major major a
growing problem for Republicans and for
Donald Trump and as a result of Donald
Trump's lack of popularity in the
Midwest okay the overall advantage for
Democrats in the upcoming midterms has
grown significantly over the last two
months and there are all sorts of
different voter models you can look at
that look at the Senate that look at the
House of Representatives based on
leaning and likely seats and different
likely voter models but the big picture
is that the numbers have dropped gone
significantly in the direction of
Democrats over the last two months the
voting group that is responsible for
that swing away from Republicans and
Trump endorsed Republicans and towards
Democrats are voters in the Midwest of
the United States of America they have
swung 13 percentage points since July
towards Democrats and it's not just one
poll there's this national NPR Marist
Poll which shows that
the 2018 midterm sort of outlook has
swung significantly toward Democrats
over the last two months if you look at
Marist state-by-state polls you will see
that the big changes are in the Midwest
and it is again away from Republicans
and towards Democrats now this could
actually be this it's almost like kind
of obvious but it doesn't happen that
often this could actually be people in
the Midwest realizing that Trump is
screwing them big-time and is screwing
them specifically more than he's
screwing most other people in the United
States of America Trump's abortive
tariffs which I've been talking about
for months are bad for mostly everyone
but they're especially bad for people in
the Midwest who work in farming and who
work in manufacturing to pick a couple
of industries wouldn't it be wonderful
if quite simply people reacted to
politicians passing policy that's bad
for them by saying I'm going to vote for
someone else the rich do it right the
rich see very clearly okay this is who's
going to give me a tax cut or this is
who's going to give my business a tax
reduction and that's who I'm going to
vote for and I'm gonna use the money
that I have surplus money because I've
been getting those tax cuts from
Republican presidents for a long time
and I am going to refund all it back in
to people who are going to pass laws
that are good for my checkbook but good
good for my pocketbook good for my bank
account whatever whatever metaphor or
analogy you want to use what if the
farming industry and the manufacturing
industry in the Midwest simply said this
guy screwing us we're going to vote for
someone else we're going to put aside
what might be differences on social
issues and we're going to vote for
somebody who is not actively part of the
problem that is screwing us day after
day after day now let's talk about what
needs to happen in the Midwest and in
other parts of the country in November
polls are nice but voting is what counts
and President Obama former President
Obama has been talking about this and so
have many others whatever the polls say
these Midwesterners and everybody else
must get out and vote and we are going
to start putting together possible sort
of result scenarios 538 has been doing
some really good work on this and there
are other websites that are doing really
really good mathematical work here and
all of that matters but every single
person that watches the show that
listens to the show needs to treat
whatever race you can participate in by
voting or by phone banking or by
volunteering or donating treat every
race as 50/50 make sure you were
registered to vote and actually do vote
but then if you have the means to donate
donate if you have the time to volunteer
or if you can make time and I think that
you should do that and when you look at
these different election previews like
the one on five thirty eight.com check
out some of those races they'll often be
ranked as safe Democrat and Republican
likely Democrat and Republican and
leaning Democrat and Republican those
leaning and likely are the ones where
get out the vote and phone banking and
all of that type of activism can
actually make a difference so please
please do it this is a massive you
should be engaged period because this
stuff matters and if you watch the show
you probably already are engaged to some
degree otherwise you'd be watching or
listening to something else but this is
an opportunity in terms of the
importance of these midterms that does
not come up all the time it has been a
long time since there have been midterms
of this degree of consequence if you
don't plan to vote okay
I'm speaking directly to you now please
email me and explain to me why you don't
plan to vote in November I can't think
of any good reasons not to vote in
November and if you don't plan to vote
other than you know there's some
logistical reason why you're not going
to be voting if you're gonna choose not
to vote please tell me I want to hear
from you and I also want to hear from
you on Twitter where you can find me at
des Pakman follow me there you can also
follow the show on twitter at david
pakman show we'll take a quick break we
have a fantastic program for you today
in this next story I'm going to give you
the headline as it was reported and then
I'll give you the deed
which surprisingly are not actually as
exciting as the headline suggests you've
probably heard that Donald Trump has
been accused of various forms of sexual
assault by all sorts of different people
all women I believe and this even
includes forcible rape of a minor girl
okay
one of the women who accused Trump is
summer servos who was a contestant
previously on The Apprentice which is
this reality show that Donald Trump
hosted years ago so the news as it's
being reported is Trump will have to
answer questions in a case involving
summer servos that's true
but now I'm going to give you all the
mitigating factors that make this much
less of a big deal than it might sound
like so first of all this is a
defamation lawsuit it's not a criminal
trial so yes it is a case but it's a
defamation lawsuit not a criminal trial
number two Donald Trump will answer the
questions technically but they are going
to be answered in writing by his
attorneys so this is going to make it
extraordinarily unlikely that anything
notable or controversial is going to
come from it number three even though it
still would be a crime to lie on the
written answers as I mentioned earlier
in the show perjury is both incredibly
difficult to prosecute and you can
indict a sitting president on criminal
charges you have to impeach them so even
if Trump lied in his written answers
about the defamation suit by some some
reserve OHS he's not going to get
impeached for lying on answers in a
defamation lawsuit from summer servos so
yeah Trump has been ordered to answer
questions but his lawyers are going to
provide answers that we know aren't
going to contain any significant amount
of substance it's interesting it's not
nothing but it would be endlessly more
interesting at this point simply to get
Donald Trump's tax returns rather than
answers in a summer servos defamation
lawsuit the one interesting legal thing
here that I do want to mention and that
that we actually have been talking about
for a while is that yes Donald Trump any
president the consensus the legal
consensus seems to be that
immune from criminal prosecution during
his presidency he may even be even be
immune from being forced to testify in
criminal trials during his presidency
that's less clear this is a civil case
which while it would lead to at worst
Donald Trump you know maybe having to
give some reserve us money the President
does not have immunity from such cases
and the president is also not immune to
civil penalties while presidents so some
reserve OHS could win the defamation
lawsuit and Trump could have to pay up
his position as president wouldn't
affect that I want to go back to one
other thing in both the civil and
criminal matters that Donald Trump is
dealing with so in this case it's a
civil matter defamation lawsuit from
from an accuser criminal like the Trump
Moeller Russia investigation Trump's
lawyers constantly are saying he's way
too busy to actually show up and testify
or to answer questions so he's going to
have to do it in writing with Muller
they want the questions in writing in
this case they wanted and got an
agreement that allows them to answer the
questions in writing Trump genuinely
doesn't seem too busy to show up to this
stuff he's golfing 25% of the time twice
a day I think it was 9:30 and 4:30 he
gets a propaganda file of positive news
coverage he watches cable news for hours
every single morning
he holds rallies all over the country
that are for a presidential race that
hasn't even really started yet he tweets
for hours every single night he's not
too busy
it's simply untrue and it would be great
if at some point a judge or an
investigator or someone said wait wait a
second you're clearly not too busy
you're gonna have to show up because
you're spending a quarter of your time
golfing but then of course the dreaded
perjury trap could happen I actually
fret I'm not gonna you know you all know
where I'm not gonna say where but it's
one of these trumpian enclaves of the
internet I read some crumb pused saying
it's good that he's going to answer
these questions in writing because
otherwise he could fall for a perjury
trap this is a defamation case that is
civil if there's going to be a place
where Donald Trump
you would think would just say I'm gonna
tell the truth because the truth is far
simpler here it would be in this
particular instance but alas you can't
really talk sense into them if you were
not following the david pakman show on
instagram at david pakman show you
missed great pictures from my trip
including one with former david pakman
show producer louis follow the david

about those two college dropouts that
started their own watch company movement
em VMT
the company has grown like crazy they've
now sold almost two million watches in a
hundred and sixty countries i still
alternate my two
MV MT watches they start at just 95
bucks and movement continues to
revolutionize fashion on the belief that
style should not break the bank i don't
know if you've checked the site out
lately but they've doubled the number of
watch styles they continue to expand and
they've also introduced sunglasses and
fashion forward bracelets for her i had
a chance to do some very extensive
testing on the sunglasses during my road
trip in california a few months ago i
sat on them twice while driving a rental
car didn't break i still wear them my
favorite new style is the revolver
collection which you can check out at

support our advertisers which also
supports us let's talk about what's
going on with Brett Kavanaugh the Senate
Judiciary Committee held hearings about
Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee
Brett Kavanaugh last week they're
scheduled to vote on
number xx and what has transpired in
these hearings is nothing short of
absolutely stunning now I could spend a
bunch of time talking about this amazing
exchange that took place between Senator
camel Harris and Kavanagh during which
Cavanaugh sort of played dumb and played
semantic games around whether or not he
had spoken to people in the justice
system about the robert muller trump
russia investigation but that was dealt
with last week by our guest hosts
adequately so i'm gonna move on from
that what i want to talk to you about
today is about straight-up perjury right
lying under oath during confirmation
hearings remember that Brett Kavanaugh
has had confirmation hearings before he
has had confirmation hearings in at
least in 2004 and 2006 for lower Court
judgeships and like last week he was
similarly under oath during these prior
confirmation hearings and we now have a
treasure trove of documents that have
been released relating to Brett
Kavanaugh and there is just too much
that directly contradicts things he said
during these prior confirmation hearings
over the years to say that they were
anything other than lies now of course a
lie is not necessarily perjury perjury
is very difficult to prosecute and prove
but we'll talk about that a little bit I
also want to make clear this the the
details not the specifics but the
details of each of the lies aren't so
important I'm going to give you the
overview of each of the lies because
really what I want to talk about is the
bigger picture so here's one example a
Republican aide to the Senate Judiciary
Committee named Manuel Miranda stole
thousands of documents belonging to the
DNC back in 2002 Cavanaugh denied having
received any of the stolen documents in
confirmation hearings in both 2004 and
2006 some of the documents that were
released show that Cavanaugh did indeed
receive documents from Manuel Miranda
light that's lie number one okay line
number two in 2006 Cavanaugh said that
he knew nothing about the war
less wiretapping under george w bush
carried out by the NSA emails provided
to the new york times in the last week
show that Cavanaugh was involved in at
minimum the initial discussions around
that NSA warrantless wiretapping program
and he specifically was asked by Justice
Department attorney John you remember
him we've talked about him before about
the Fourth Amendment implications of
this program that is line number two
line number three from Brett Kavanaugh
told under oath back in 2006 during that
confirmation hearing he said he wasn't
involved in any legal questions
surrounding the detention of enemy
today I'll be speaking with Andrew
Seidel who's a civil rights and
constitutional attorney with the Freedom
From Religion Foundation where he serves
as director of strategic response he
works to keep church and state separate
as they should be his first book the
founding myth why Christian nationalism
is unamerican will be out in May of 2019
Andrew so great to talk to you I've seen
interviews that you've done and I think
that there's just so much material right
now to discuss that you work on
so maybe just to start somewhere when we
talk about church and state separation
is this a concept that the average
American has an accurate grasp on or do
you think that there are sort of some
basics about what we mean by separation
of church and state that maybe are
missing from the the lay person's
understanding I definitely think there
are some basics that are missing and I
would I would say not just from the lay
person's understanding but even from
experts in this area of law you know we
heard in judge Kavanaugh hearings this
week how some people sometimes conflate
the separation of state in church with
hostility towards religion and and
that's absolutely not the case and in
fact you can't have true religious
freedom the freedom of religion without
a government that is free from religion
it's just the two cannot coexist you
have to have a secular government it's a
prerequisite for genuine religious
liberty and and to me that's the biggest
thing that I think people don't
understand about state church separation
is that it protects every American and
when you talk about that that separation
of the the infrastructure of law there
is the often discussed Establishment
Clause idea of the the concept of the
government establishing one religion
over others or religion over
non-religion for example but when you
actually want to expand and take a
deeper look at the law what other
relevant points of law are important
when we think about what what the
foundation is for separation of church
and state the foundation of state church
separation is it's right there in the
Constitution you know the Constitution
mentions religion
three times before it was amended the
only mention of it was in article 6
which prohibits religious tests for
public office and I mean this is
actually really striking especially for
the founding generation now at the time
no nation had ever divorced religion and
government the way the founders chose to
in fact our Constitution is entirely
godless it doesn't mention any
supernatural being at all which was also
you know this unique contribution of the
founding generation and then later on a
couple years later they had the First
Amendment which says that Congress shall
make no law respecting an establishment
of religion or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof and those are the only
three mentions of religion in the entire
document and all of them are
exclusionary right they're meant to keep
religion out of government and
government out of religion so it really
it begins and ends with the Constitution
and it's very clear if you look at that
document even just the words you don't
have to study you don't have to be an
attorney that the government has no as
Alexander Hamilton put it no particle of
spiritual jurisdiction right it just
doesn't have the power to get involved
in religion one way or another you'll
sometimes hear from some people in the
United States we don't need to
necessarily characterize who that the
founding fathers were religious and thus
you sort of have to read between the
lines at the separation of church and
state stuff and that they fully intended
that okay maybe maybe some of these
things are written until into the law to
prevent it from getting out of hand but
that really this is at at core a quote
Christian nation is that a leaf forget
about the morality or the logic of it
right
is that a legally valuable analysis or
is it as simple as what matters is
what's written no I mean that that's a
completely flawed analysis and actually
that's the subject of my book that comes
out in May I go through and debunk the
entire idea of a Christian nation or
that we are even founded on
judeo-christian principles you know both
of these are are flawed ideas and you
can argue about whether or not the
founders were religious whether or not
they were Christian whether or not they
were evangelical Christian you know
Jesus rose from the dead kind of Chris
or even deists but but at the end of the
day it doesn't really matter because we
know that they wanted state and church
separate that they wanted these two
different spheres of power and they
didn't want them intersecting or
overlapping and that's why Thomas
Jefferson chose the metaphor of a wall
right this isn't of a fine line that is
easily overstepped it's a wall it's
meant to be tall and strong and
impregnable and it's meant to not just
benefit all of us to all of our citizens
but even the religious citizens right I
mean the people who benefited most from
the founding generation were religious
minorities and they were very supportive
of state church separation for that idea
Catholics and Southern Baptists were
among the the biggest supporters of
state church separation because they
were minority religions and they didn't
want the government weighing in and
coercing them or even pressuring them
however slightly into one religion or
another or benefiting the majority
religion which is certainly something
we're seeing happening today yeah what
what do you make of I mean I've we can
talk about examples of ten commandments
at a federal building we can talk about
manger displays and some of these other
notable newsworthy cases but at its core
isn't the fact that Christmas is a
federal holiday an establishment of
religion I mean I know that it's sort of
like it's it's almost too obvious and
and it's not a battle that I think we're
gonna win anytime soon but it does that
count as an establishment of religion by
the government sure and as someone who
is on the front lines of the war on
Christmas every year I I would I would
absolutely argue that it does I mean the
the way that courts have looked at this
particular issue is they've said well
because there is a valid reason for the
government to want to close in this case
it just happens that most people are
Christian they would want to take that
day off anyway the government would
essentially shut down if 70 percent of
the workers took the day off that is in
their minds a in courts minds sometimes
a secular purpose behind the holiday so
they have upheld it however we've
actually the Freedom From Religion
Foundation has actually gotten laws like
that struck down when the purpose is
very clearly religious so here in
Wisconsin there was a
Friday holiday and I don't remember the
exact reason that the Legislature passed
this law but it was essentially
something along the lines of you know we
want to make sure everybody can go to
church and worship and the government
struck down that or the excuse me the
Court struck down that holiday when FFRF
brought the lawsuit because it was
overtly religious when we talked about
the Supreme Court decision on same-sex
marriage which held or affirmed that at
the state level you cannot ban same-sex
marriage that was the end of one very
important discussion which was what is
going to ultimately happen when in terms
of individual couples getting married
but it was very clearly only the
beginning for a whole sort of new front
in the battle against LGBT rights and
I've been talking about it since day one
which is arguing along lines of
so-called religious freedom to
discriminate in different ways against
LGBT individuals or people perceived to
be LGBT individuals but who are
discriminated against in the same way
talk a little bit about the relatively
well funded campaigns that now are
operating and whether it's about baking
cakes or employer employer employee
relations related to religion and some
of these other fronts how would you
generally characterize what's now being
used as a way to fight against LGBT
rights under the guise of so-called
religious freedom yeah I mean there's
there's so much to unpack there we could
talk about that for hours but basically
what is happening is the Religious Right
is attempting to redefine religious
freedom and actually a better way to put
it might be that they're attempting to
weaponize religious freedom you know
they're turning it into what used to be
this this shield to protect an
individual's right to believe and in
some cases act on that belief in a way
that wouldn't harm others into now a way
to impose their religion on other people
we're seeing it in the Hobby Lobby case
from 2014 where this massive company is
using religion to impose their religious
beliefs on their employers and as you
pointed out after the obergefell this
that equalised marriage for LGBTQ
individuals you know that push kind of
kicked into overdrive and what we're
what you're really seeing is the
Religious Right trying to use God as a
license to discriminate and this is the
big push that we are fighting back
against here at the Freedom From
Religion Foundation we've been fighting
against it since before the Hobby Lobby
case we we saw this coming we saw the
attempt to redefine religious liberty
coming and we've been trying to push
back against it and finally it does seem
to be that the country is sort of waking
up to this idea that you know just
because you happen to have a belief and
it happens to be religious doesn't mean
you get to act on that belief no you
know they want to say I can do this
because my God says so and it doesn't
matter what the impact is on other
people but courts have never decided
that though this Supreme Court and the
shifting Supreme Court I would not put
it past them we're coming we've come
dangerously close and I think we're all
possibly on the verge of a seismic shift
here one of the areas of concern to me
about the shift from the conversation
about can two men or two women get
married at the state level to what we're
talking about now the use of so-called
religious freedom to discriminate is
that one Supreme Court decision made it
super clear states can't ban same-sex
marriage period that is it's very cut
and dry in a sense or at least
relatively cut and dry religious freedom
can be argued in so many different
contexts and in so many different ways
that it seems more complex to me to
imagine that there can be any single
decision at any level that would prevent
that from being done because you can
argue it in so many different ways is
that accurate or could there be some
umbrella solution here no I think that's
a that's an excellent observation on
your part and actually this has been
addressed by the Supreme Court way back
in the 1870s they said that to allow a
citizen to exempt themselves from the
law because of their religion that
government could only exist in name
under such circumstances right you would
have the law would become Swiss cheese
where anybody who believed in any
particular belief as long as it was real
would be able to exempt themselves from
whatever law of a says they say burdens
that religious belief I mean that is a
recipe for anarchy not for religious
freedom and honestly they're doing a
good job of pushing that narrative I
mean it you know in the masterpiece cake
shop case at its core that case was
about discrimination right I mean it was
a it was a couple was discriminated
against by a business but the story that
everybody talked about was the religious
freedom of not a baker but a bakery and
that I that is just amazing to me how
much they pushed this narrative and how
far they've advanced it this is a good
spot to pause with Andrew sidle from the
Freedom From Religion Foundation we will
pick up our conversation with him
tomorrow starting with we'll get to the
Trump administration but we will start
with the relationship between Freedom
From Religion and freedom of speech
which is an increasingly popular topic
particularly in some on online enclaves
we'll pick it up there Andrew thank you
my pleasure we are continuing our
conversation with Andrew Seidel who is a
civil rights and constitutional attorney
with the Freedom From Religion
Foundation he serves as director of
strategic response works to keep state
and church separate his first book is
out in May 2018 was out May 2018 the
founding myth why Christian nationalism
is unamerican let's pick up our
conversation if we can Andrew with the
idea of the inter player connection
between freedom from and freedom of
religion and the First Amendment because
this is something that I think you know
we started part one of the interview
talking about misconceptions about
freedom from religion and freedom of
religion and separation of church and
state
there are numerous arguments that are
often made by those who are de facto
supporting discrimination in many cases
that what what we might see what you and
I might see or some others who have sort
of the political leanings that that we
might have see as discrimination among
religious lines is merely the expression
of speech and that is something that
cannot be curtailed is there a gray area
when we talk about freedom from and of
religion and speech or are the limits
pretty clear as to when
we're talking about one versus the other
sure well and just a quick quick note
the book comes out in May 2019 I think
that was my fault but I think to your
question the the limits used to be clear
but in recent say two decades there has
been a push and this is deliberate it's
a legal strategy by the Religious Right
to conflate religious freedom and free
speech the goal was because free speech
has been so carefully protected in this
nation and because religious liberty is
really not under threat in this country
right there's I mean especially if you
are a Christian the danger that a
government which is run you know I mean
how much of our federal legislature are
always run by Christians you're talking
to ninety-nine percent probably there
was no real danger to Christianity from
a religious freedom standpoint in this
nation so one of the things that the
Religious Right started doing was taking
their arguments to court along free
speech lines and they did this
successfully in the school context and
now they're starting to expand it out
and you've saw it in the masterpiece
cake shop case kind of writ large
and I mean the striking thing about that
case is there was there was no request
for a specific cake that said something
they didn't actually even get a chance
this couple didn't even actually get a
chance to discuss with the Baker what
they wanted on their cake so he didn't
have any idea of what expression he was
going to have to give so there was there
was actually no free speech issue in
that case just because of the facts but
again they did a really great job of
promoting that narrative and conflating
it with the religious freedom narrative
so I the lines used to be very clear but
they've done a good job from a legal
standpoint of blurring them
yeah and it's it's being done not it's
not being done in good faith in other
words as you're pointing out a good job
is done because that that side benefits
from the blurring of those lines and
that kind of gets me to the Trump
administration where is an organization
like the Freedom From Religion
Foundation most concerned when it comes
to the actions of the current
administration in the context of
separation of church and state religious
freedom just
I mean that that's a that's a tough
question to answer we've actually we
sued the Trump administration over their
religious liberty executive order that
they put out on the National Day of
Prayer
last year in 2017 we took them to court
that same day
actually over that the we've sued them
about the White House Bible study that
they have about getting access to
records to that I think overall probably
the most alarming thing if you care
about a secular government if you care
about religious freedom and the true
sense and state church separation is the
reshaping of the federal judiciary is is
incredibly alarming if Trump and Mitch
McConnell get their way about one in
every seven judges on the federal bench
will have been appointed by Trump by the
end of the year and that is just hugely
alarming and then of course there could
be two on the Supreme Court that he'd
already have appointed so that to me is
probably the the biggest problem that we
currently are facing because it's a
problem that we're gonna have for 30 or
40 years so how does so we've all
started to read about Bret Cavanaugh's
ideas about abortion for example and
there's a very clear link between
religion and opposition to abortion but
it's more complex than that right the
ways in which a Supreme Court justice
for decades in many cases can influence
issues of separation of church and state
go way beyond whether roe v wade might
someday be repealed can you talk about
the different ways in which a Supreme
Court justice can impact these issues
the types of cases that come up I mean
absolutely and it's it's virtually
without limit the impact they can have
and we're actually already seeing it
just with the retirement of Anthony
Kennedy lower court judges got an idea
of what type of nominee Trump would put
up and they're starting to alter their
opinions you know in two of the cases
that FFRF has taken we got a cross on
public land in a public park in Florida
struck down declared unconstitutional no
cross has ever been upheld as
constitutional in a public park and the
same thing there was a cross on
city seal in Pennsylvania both courts
struck those down but in the opinions
that the court wrote they put all this
regret they said you know we wish we
didn't have to decide this case this way
we think that Establishment Clause and
state church separation that that area
of law is a shambles the court needs to
step in and overturn our opinion we're
deciding the way precedent dictates but
we think we shouldn't have to and
decisions like that were unthinkable a
couple of years ago and I think had the
election gone differently and appointees
to the Supreme Court gone differently I
do not believe opinions like that would
have been written so is that like a
signal is that a in the same way that
absolutely apologies for what some might
find to be a bad analogy but is this
sort of like we've seen white
supremacists claim that even though
Trump's not really saying the thing he's
signaling in a certain way where if you
know the language you understand what
he's kind of getting at is that the same
type of thing that we're seeing court
signal I don't I don't even think it's a
dog whistle I think they're being very
open about it and the reason they're
being open about it is because we know
for instance what Brett Kavanaugh thinks
of the wall of separation he has
so today we're gonna play for you my
interview with a Democratic congressman
Tim Ryan I interviewed him at Netroots
nation in New Orleans Louisiana about 10
days ago very interesting guy and here's
as I've reflected on this interview that
we're about to play here's the question
I want you to think about as you listen
to and watch this interview is Tim Ryan
one of the good guys does he strike you
as one of the Democrats in the house
that is actually on the ball when it
comes to the realities of our politics
work focusing on the right things and
and informed in a way that is useful for
the progressive move of the Democratic
Party or do you think he's just another
one of these corporate Democrats think
about that as we check out this
interview from Netroots nation 2018 in
New Orleans Louisiana with congressman
Tim Ryan
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
I'm here with congressman Tim Ryan who
is like everybody up for re-election
because the elections are every two
years do you think that this system of
two-year terms
serves the voters the best might might
sort of thought process on this for a
while has been your campaigning a lot of
the time having to raise money a lot of
the time just by virtue of it being a
two-year term I think there might be a
better way to arrange that or do you
think the voters are best served by this
system well it's self-serving to say we
should do four-year terms I do think in
this environment that may be worth
exploring but the main problem is the
money I think we need to move to a
public public finance election system
where each candidate gets certain amount
of money I think we limit the amount of
time so it's only a couple months like
they do in Europe and then you run hard
you knock on doors you put a campaign
together the country talks about it but
if you don't get the money out you're
gonna be spending four years raising
money and people just raise more money
and I think you'll just it'll eat up
just the same amount of time I think
there's sort of like three meta issues
and you name one of them right now at
whether you care about education or LGBT
rights or whatever you've got campaign
finance Internet freedom net neutrality
since that impacts coverage of whatever
issue is important and climate change
because if we destroy the planet it's
gonna be hard to lobby for LGBT rights
or whatever else the people that are in
power were elected by the system that we
have so fundamentally it's not really in
their interest to change that system
right so how do we break that because
you get somebody who says I want to
change the system they get in with the
system we have that's the system that
keeps them in so how can we sort of
shake that up well I think we need to
organize around those principles and so
I think we talked about as a leading
issue publicly financed elections like
that will pull the rug out from the
issue that we're facing with climate
because all of a sudden the moneyed
interests and that are behind that won't
have the influence over the political
system anymore and I think also finding
a way to talk about climate in the way
that that surrounds growth
in the economy you know wind and solar
jobs are growing at 25 or 30 percent a
year so how do we talk about that in a
way that says hey a portion of that
growth has to go to distress communities
has to go to old coal country old steel
country or rubber country like a lot of
the areas that I represent in the south
so that people will feel a part of that
new economy we also need when you can't
talk about climate without talking about
agriculture and that a regenerative
agriculture cent the sustainable
agriculture a big component of
sequestering carbon and getting us
healthy food which will drive down
healthcare costs so these are all
interconnected as you know but the money
is the real impediment because it
empowers forces that aren't always in it
for the common good food seems like
negative externality is sort of the the
key element that's missing from a lot of
the talking point discussions about
issues like for example with health care
for all whether you support it or not or
single-payer universal the idea that
I've got to pay for somebody else's
healthcare well you know crime goes down
when people have more care people make
better decisions about what job they're
going to take that actually aligns with
their values when they don't have to
stay in a job only to keep care how can
we that's it's it's simple but it's also
complex when you have corporate media
with four-minute interview segments
right so like what's a way to start
talking about that concept of negative
externalities in a way that doesn't have
like a glaze over effect yeah I thought
well I think you just started that
process I talked about the Medicare for
all which I've been a coach monster of
since 2007 and then we just recently
started a medicare-for-all caucus this
is a pro-business move you know the one
thing I hear from businesses all over
the country is health care what do I
hear from my friends in labor but they
have to negotiate about all the time
health care get that off the books let's
provide some certainty for the next five
or ten years you're gonna know exactly
what you're paying in health care so the
business could if they wanted to
negotiate or give their employees more
basically a supplemental and Medicare
Advantage style thing that they could
negotiate so they can have more
great fine do that but we want you
focusing on job jobs job creation
pensions put money in people's pensions
and wages and getting wages up and if we
can grow the economy by talking about
Medicare for all so I think we take it
head-on we don't sit here and just say
well it'd be nice for you to have it and
they'll be less crime and you know I may
not live in a neighborhood full of crime
sure no I may not care about you frankly
I mean I care about you but you know
somebody made an eidetic type of
ethically right allegedly but if you're
if you're telling a business person this
is going to be good for your business
good for employees but for your family
then that's a much better argument more
potent argument which I would like to
see I start making I saw Pete
D'Alessandro who was a Bernie's campaign
person in Iowa I went campaign for him a
little bit he was talking about Medicare
for all in the context of saving
capitalism and growing the economy and I
think that's a really potent argument
for us to make taxes so we have in the
House Democrats sort of because of
gerrymandering and the urban-rural
divide or at a mathematical disadvantage
in the Senate just because you've been
in the Senate you know one third of the
seats are up each election and it's not
actually the best setup right now for
Democrats but hypothetically taking
control of one or both of those houses
would you support or introduce
legislation to undo the changes to the
tax code that Donald Trump's
administration has put in place yes I
would I would keep the middle-class tax
cuts and even find a way to maybe expand
them I'm on a bill with ROH Khanna to
expand the Earned Income Tax Credit
which would put a lot of money back in
the pockets of working-class people
I think that's what we would do but
we've we do need tax reform you know the
the corporate tax is a joke I mean it it
affects workers and a you know a fifth
of them don't pay any tax at all so
we've got to find a whole new way to
capture the income concentration that's
happened in the United States and and
that maybe there's a billionaire tax you
know obviously raise the top tax rate
but I think we've got to provide some
relief
middle-class cuz they're just they're
still not getting ahead we saw just
recently wages went up I think two point
nine percent inflation went up three
percent right so we're still not closing
the gap on income inequality is actually
growing so we've got to provide tax
relief I think in the short term for
those folks and I think getting rid of
this joke of a tax whatever it was it
was not reformed it was basically
supply-side economics around three where
would you put the top tax rate and where
would that bracket start I don't know I
mean we'd have to you can't I don't
think you can look at this is like one
it certainly has to go up okay I mean
it's it you know the the the main
talking point was it should go back up
to the clinton-era levels which is
almost 40 right so you know I think
depending on what the other taxes you
put in place you know do you talk about
a carbon tax you know as we're dealing
with climate change is that part of the
package or what are you doing with
barrels of oil is that something that
you're gonna do which would all kind of
fit together so it's hard to say but
clearly the main economic issue we have
today is the concentration of wealth in
the hands of a few eighty percent of the
people are struggling they see the stock
market go up they see unemployment rates
go down they see the GDP growth happen
that's for 20 percent those those
indicators don't mean anything that
someone in Youngstown Ohio at this point
right so you can't you can't say what
this level will be at at level B without
the whole context but we've got to
figure out how to get to this
concentration of wealth and make the
investments back into a country we need
to make the sort of other side of this
or it's not even really the other side
but it's related as debt and deficit
yeah and I've read a lot about sort of
your your positions over the years and
maybe some have changed on undetonated
I get a little concerned when I see
Democrats talk about debt and deficit in
the same terms that Republicans do but
merely with a sort of different
perspective because increasingly with
modern monetary theory and sort of this
understanding that deficit in and of
itself isn't necessarily bad depending
on why we're increasing the deficit if
that's what we're doing right
do you think that the debt and deficit
issue is a winning one for Democrats or
are they just playing into an argument
that the the right has framed in a way
that it can't really be won on those
terms I think it's an important issue
because it's the responsible thing to do
I agree with you borrowing money like we
do for our families you know
unfortunately now hopefully we can
change this too and have tuition-free
policies in the United States but
borrowing money to send your kid to
school for the most part up until
recently pretty good investment taking a
loan out them have a house a pretty good
investment car pretty good investment
get back and forth to work those are
investments that paid off
so borrowing money to rebuild the
country a pretty good investment you
know so those are the kind of things we
have to make but at the end of the day
I'm we're balancing the budget at some
point but when you have huge
concentrations of wealth and those
people are you know paying enough to
help us balance the budget yeah that's
the difference for your right to
identify that the Republicans use it as
a cynical ploy to say we got to balance
the budget so we're gonna squeeze social
programs that's what they do so they
just borrowed two point three trillion
for the new tax cut and we turn around a
week later and say hey we want to get
money for snap the Supplemental
Nutrition that what did they say do I
get that but even I mean when you say
you want to balance the budget why what
happens if you don't balance the budget
because there's a lot of you know
hyperinflation it's not totally clear
that depending on why the deficit is
going up the deficit can go up a hundred
million but if that hundred million goes
into for example health care which cuts
down on employee absenteeism which leads
to higher wage growth which the
government then gets a piece of it's not
so cut and dry to me that just balancing
the budget for its own sake is a winning
talking point I don't mind having
borrowing some money just like we do in
our homes if therefore good investments
but at the end of the day big deficits
like the ones we're gonna have we're
gonna have about you know a trillion
dollar deficit here in the next year and
it's gonna run into the future they're
adding a trillion dollars and then
paying interest on that is a problem and
then when you're paying interest on that
and you borrowed the money from China
right and China's taking the interest
payments and they're building islands
and bases in Africa and investing in an
additive manufacturing advanced
manufacturing aerospace wind solar
high-speed rail and dislodging us from
from being economically competitive
that's and that's an another reason why
you don't want to be borrowing money
that seems like a stronger issue to me
then then balance for the sake of
balance right it's specifically why it
is when when the deficit goes up because
people who are mostly saving the money
as opposed to spending it or getting a
tax cut that that seems to be a stronger
argument but again it's like in four to
six minute corporate news interviews
you're just not going to get that sort
of level of nuance you're gonna get
anything you're not gonna get what do
you make of the split that it definitely
exists to some degree but I'm curious
what to what degree you think it exists
between this movement on the left to go
towards democratic socialism as opposed
to social democracy to the extent people
understand the difference I've been
talking a lot about there's some
confusion about those those two terms of
course democratic socialism be more
actual socialism social democracy more
the Swedish model is this a split on the
Left right now I'm hearing more about it
but I don't know enough to actually say
it's a split I mean you know clearly the
free enterprise system is broken right
now
you know we've lost the protections that
need to be in place on the environment
on workers on pensions on wages and all
these things that we've had in place
worked unions weakening unions which
were the main counterbalance to the free
enterprise system but I still think that
the free enterprise system for us in
America if it's fixed and well regulated
and operating the way it should with an
appropriate strong robust government to
fill in the knock off the rough edges of
the free enterprise system I still think
it's the best
for us in allocating resources but also
an innovation we are a country of
innovators and creators and
entrepreneurs the problem is all of that
wealth has got stuck basically in three
states venture capital money 80% of it
goes to three states California New York
in Massachusetts that's broken three
great states by the way phenomenal
states all vaalu but you know we need
that investment in Youngstown Ohio right
so the system is broke it's creating
wealth it's creating value and we
actually brought Silicon Valley 3:13
venture capitalists from Silicon Valley
to on a bus tour in Youngstown Akron
Detroit Flint in South Bend Indiana and
what they said when they got to our
areas they said there's things happen in
here that we didn't even know about
innovations creativity happening here
that can lead to job creation so the
idea is this free enterprise can work
but the capital is now stuck in these
three areas and in these wealthy pockets
throughout the country and then
concentrated to a larger degree that's
where you need strong public policy so
that's that's social democracy so if
someone said no I actually think we need
to socialize the means of production and
eliminate private ownership of business
and and make that social you would be
against that it sounds like if so what
you're advocating fixing the free
enterprise system but keeping them for
that social democracy if someone said I
want social to socialize the means of
production that's not something you
would be in favor no not at all okay
2018 midterms coming up at this point do
you believe that in in Ohio you know not
not always a red state but it's been a
key state for Republicans when they've
won at the national level how much is
Trump affecting races like yours or even
more local races like state Senate's and
legislators is a trump alignment helpful
is it a hindrance at this point or the
local races not really influenced by
that it's super helpful in a Republican
primary we're seeing that all over even
his tweets in Florida for the
gubernatorial primary
completely flipped the script there all
of a sudden Trump's candidate took off
not sure yet in a general I think
there's been a lot of softening and
we're gonna see in the special election
that's happening on Tuesday in just a
northern suburb of Columbus where our
candidate Danny O'Connor is
neck-and-neck now with a Republican in a
district that Trump won by 11 points
it's John Kasich old congressional
district so it's kind of a Rockefeller
Republican area a lot of immigrants from
Somalia and Bangladesh in that area
they're very tolerant strong LGBTQ
community slight slightly right a center
on probably some economic issues higher
income people
yeah but tolerant and and I think they
don't like the chaos violates their
Midwestern sensibilities and the race
baiting with LeBron James and in any
other black person he can stand up and
say oh look they're you know they're
dumb you know it just it violates kind
of who we are and so I think we're gonna
see a shift I really do that we're gonna
have a good year a good year congressman
Sam Ryan hopefully good for you anyway
and in November really appreciate thank
you thanks for having me pleasure yeah

[Applause]
this idea of Donald Trump being a
Russian asset dating all the way back to
the 1980s is getting more and more
attention and it's about to get even
more attention because a new book claims
the exact same thing and over the last I
guess week to ten days Omarosa versus
Trump has been getting a lot of
attention but that's sort of like the
pop culture story to this more serious
organized-crime Russian asset story and
there's a new book called house of Trump
house of Putin the untold story of
Donald Trump in the Russian mafia and
the author of the book is Craig Unger
who's a harvard-educated investigative
journalist who's done some really great
investigative work in the past including
the book house of Busch House of Saud
related to the bush family's
relationship with the royal family of
Saudi Arabia and this new book trump
house of Trump House of Putin starts
first of all by naming 59 specific
Russians that Craig Unger claims are
business associates of Donald Trump now
remember Trump has claimed many times to
have no business with Russians period
aside from the occasional luxury condo
sale in Manhattan or whatever else so
that's one part of this that fifty-nine
specific Russian individuals are named
as having relationships with Donald
Trump but the real story in the book is
that Unger claims that Trump may be
compromised and a Russian asset and
specifically says that the reason Trump
may have become a compromised Russian
asset is that he has allegedly been
laundering billions of dollars in
Russian money through his real estate
deals with Russians and these alleged
financial ties with Russia go obviously
directly counter to what Trump has
specifically said before like for
example Trump said quote I have no
dealings with Russia
I have no deals that could happen in
Russia because we've stayed away and I
have no loans with Russia
I have no loans with Russia at all so
let's take a step back first of all why
would Russia have all this money that
they want to launder like why would
Russians be in positions to want to
launder money through Trump rather than
Nicaraguans
well this all dates back to when the
Soviet Union imploded and caused what's
called capital flight rich Russians had
money that they wanted to get out the
Russian mafia had money that they wanted
to get out and two really good ways to
get money out and then launder it are
casinos and real estate
Trump is involved in both of them
casinos are more conspicuous ways
because they are so well known as ways
to launder money so they apparently went
in the direction of real estate
now why would Trump do it right maybe
initially it was for the money when you
help launder money you get a cut when
Trump had financial troubles remember
Trump always brags about how he never
filed personal bankruptcy but his
businesses did for a while Trump was
having trouble getting loans the money
laundering from the Russians may have
alleviated that financial situation and
then as very often happens he gets in
too deep and maybe he can't get out and
in his book Craig Unger has interviewed
Russian mafia Russian government
connected individuals and what Unger
can't say for sure is whether Trump did
all of this knowingly
or whether he was sort of taken
advantage of right he was the Patsy he
was the useful idiot it's not 100
percent clear Unger was asked by
Newsweek in an article about the book
whether he thinks Russians have
compromising personal information about
Trump this relates to the steel dossier
and Unger said he doesn't even think if
the PP tape exists that it matters
because once again Trump claimed to have
zero Russian business associates and
Unger found 59 and his argument is the P
tape may exist the P tape may not exist
but it really doesn't matter because of
these 59 Russian contacts asked by
Newsweek in this interview Craig Unger
was asked which of your findings do you
think Americans would find most shocking
he said he has reason to believe here we
go now that there is a Russian asset in
the White House who Unger believes is
not just compromised by Russia but an
actual Russian agent that's not 100%
clear and at the those are very very big
allegations to make but this is
a guy with a bad reputation when it
comes to investigative journalism as a
Hugh did you say huge bird just ran into
that last that was crazy that startled
me actually we got that on camera yeah
birds just unable to identify glass
continues to be a thing evolutionarily
it doesn't seem to be fading away so
listen as far as this book goes if only
5% of what's in this book is true and
again Unger has a very good reputation
this is the stuff that history books
will be writing about if 20% of the book
is true it's a historic report I mean
that I'm starting to lack the vocabulary
to properly encapsulate how absurd this
is it's it sounds like the most extreme
allegation you can make in this whole
Russia Trump scandal the Trump is some
Manchurian Candidate who's being
operated by the Russians it sounds
hyperbolic but yet he has the contacts
right he has those 59 names yes you can
make a strong case and you don't have to
make the case that it's a Manchurian
Candidate per se you can actually make
the case that it's sort of a bumbling
fool who over the last 35 years has one
small step at a time become compromised
and that now this is just sort of where
he naturally ended up and putting the
actual Russians aside for a second
everyone who allows Trump to avoid
consequences for everything he's done
like let's assume eventually we figure
out exactly what he's done if you allow
him to avoid consequences you are sort
of a de facto Russian asset in the sense
that legally if any of this stuff is
true when you allow it to have no
consequences you further the goals of
those who have allegedly compromised
Trump and you're actually starting to
get into RICO stuff
Rico is the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt
Organizations Act and this is a legal
legal framework at the federal level
that was signed into law by Richard
Nixon of all people in the 1970s and
what it says is that if you commit
crimes that are part of a broader
basically organized crime I mean it was
meant to fight organized crime that it
is much more serious legally speaking so
if you just launder money you've
laundered money okay if you launder
money as part of a money laundering
racketeering and extortion organization
then
it's falls under Rico and we have here a
president who may have willingly or
unwillingly participated in criminal
activity that would fall under Rico this
is not going away if anything it's
building and we're actually trying to
get Craig Unger on the program to try to
get him to talk about the book and the
research that he's done amazing what we
are learning learning every single week
send me your thoughts I'm on Twitter at
D Pakman the show is on twitter at david
pakman show and boy do we have a good
one for you today this is just the best
I think you're gonna like this one for
all of the attacks on the infamous Trump
Russia dossier by Christopher steel
steel has now come out on top in a libel
case against him in court Trump claimed
the entire dossier was fake
his defenders claimed it was just made
up lies and it has now been upheld as at
least not libelous or defamatory in a
court of law
Christopher Steele is a former mi6
officer the UK's Intelligence Service
and he won a case in the United States
against three Russian oligarchs who sued
him because the oligarch said the stuff
that Christopher Steele put in the Trump
Russia dossier about them about us they
said was untrue it's defamatory it's
libelous and the court decided that no
that's not the case Christopher Steele
said that the case should be thrown out
and a judge agreed the judge didn't
decide are the contents accurate line by
line are they true or untrue but what
the judge did decide was that the
document the steel dossier was not
deliberately inaccurate which is the
standard that's applied to what Steele
put in it when you're trying to figure
out whether it's defamatory or libelous
so this tells us that as far as a judge
is concerned whether or not every claim
in the dossier is true it's not a
dossier put together with unsourced
knowingly false material like close to
Christopher Steele it contains claims of
varying specificity you could argue it
contains it contains claims of varying
accuracy because it's a report of what
Steele's sources told him but it was put
together in a way
that a court decided is simply not
defamatory now the Russian oligarchs
aren't pleased they said they would
quote almost certainly appeal the
court's decision it's not hugely likely
that it would go a different way on
appeal and steel is still up against
libel charges in the UK there's another
Russian named Alexei Gubarev who's named
in the dossier and he's going to have to
deal with that in the UK but this is yet
another good result I would say for the
dossier now trumpets will hear me and
they'll say David this doesn't prove the
accuracy of anything in the dossier and
that's true I'm not trying to hide that
much of the dossier has been separately
corroborated but what this decision does
mean is that the allegations about the
Russians who sued steel are beyond libel
it's a win for the legitimacy of
elements of the dossier as genuine
reports of what people told steel and I
feel like that's what's missing from the
conversation Pat people say steel made
the stuff up or Steel's not trustworthy
or or he concocted this stuff or not and
we need to punish steel for making
things up steel never claimed that these
were his assertions what Christopher
steel did is he gathered information
from sources about Donald Trump who was
orchestrating that and who wanted the
document put together people like to
debate that he was not just writing
stuff down he was documenting the claims
made about Donald Trump it was not a
document where steel purported to
adjudicate what was true and what wasn't
true and and hopefully that gets figured
out as cases are decided that they are
not defamatory on that basis yeah I feel
like the claims made by steel seem just
so outrageous when they were first
released yeah because you know this was
their first time looking at these
allegations and and people that just
kind of stuck with people right that
there is no way that the Trump PP tape
exists and that all of the Trump
associates were this involved in Russia
yeah and you know it's kind of hard to
come back from that no way and when we
actually look at the reality that more
and more elements of the dossier have
been independently corroborated over
time
we now have Michael Cohen who supposedly
had nothing to do with anything he has
now pled guilty to eight counts although
not directly related to the contents of
the dossier but it's all now fitting
together so it's really important that
you not fall for trump is saying it's
meaningless because it doesn't prove the
truth of the claims in the dossier the
story is that the people that were
claiming that what Steele wrote about
them was defamatory were able to present
no evidence that the contents were
untrue and certainly not that the
contents were defamatory and the judge
threw the case out so it's definitely
not phony it's definitely not been
discredited as what was it that Carter
page called it on the show that dodgy
dossier what we have is a list of
assertions more of which have been
independently corroborated now than at
any previous time and I think it would
actually be very interesting to go back
to the dossier and go through it point
by point now pulling out the parts that
have been separately corroborated at
this point it's quite a few and that
might actually be useful for the
audience to see us do and maybe we will
do that sometime soon this has been one
of the biggest news weeks in a very long
time I don't really remember the last
time we had a news week as big as this
week rife with guilty verdicts and
guilty pleas and lies and lies on top of
lies from the administration and we now
have a new interview that Donald Trump
did with Fox & Friends it aired in full
this morning although there were some
snippets of it that were released
yesterday and according to Donald
Trump's own words during this Fox News
interview he admits that he did know
about the hush money payments that his
now convicted lawyer Michael Cohen made
to mistresses in order for them not to
talk about their escapades with Donald
Trump Trump claims he knew about it
after the fact which of course is in
direct contradiction with the tape on
which it appears that Michael Cohen is
discussing the payments with Trump but
nonetheless we now know that Michael
Cohen is pleading guilty to crimes for
those payments which means that Donald
Trump now is connected to something that
is
criminal now you are going to hear in
this clip I'm going to play for you
you're going to hear Trump deny that the
payments had anything to do with
campaign funds but legally speaking the
payments broke the law which is why
Michael Cohen pleaded guilty but in this
clip Donald Trump appears to admit to a
federal crime which crime that is
actually depends on whether you think
he's telling the truth or not
either way there's a federal crime in
here take a listen to this and then
we'll discuss it later on
I knew later on but you have to
understand anything what he did and they
weren't taken out of campaign finance
that's a big thing that's a much bigger
thing did they come out of the campaign
they didn't come out of the campaign
they came from me and I tweeted about it
you know I put I don't know if you know
but I tweeted about the payments but
they didn't come out of campaign in fact
my first question when I heard about it
was did they come out of the campaign
because that could be a little dicey and
they didn't come out of the campaign and
that's big but they weren't that's not a
it's not even a campaign violation if
you look at President Obama he had a
massive campaign violation but he had a
different attorney general and they
viewed it a lot different you have to
mention Obama right I mean why not at
this point please get this guy in a room
with Robert Muller or Moeller's
investigators and put him under oath
because that explanation might work on
fox news's anally Erhart but there is no
way in hell that that explanation works
on a seasoned federal investigator and
aside from the de la gala t which we'll
get to isn't it stunning how casually
Trump discusses hush money payoffs to
multiple mistresses totally
matter-of-factly as if the only relevant
part is did the hush money payoffs to
your multiple mistresses
come from your campaign funds or did
they come from your personal funds now
we have heard from a lawyer former
ethics lawyer for Barack Obama norm
Eisen who says that Donald Trump seems
to inadvertently admit to a federal
crime now you might say well hold on a
second David Trump says he knew about
the payment at
they happened not before even if it's a
lie that's not an admission of a crime
that's true but there's another crime
that Trump appears to have admitted to
here
Trump signed his federal disclosures in
2017 for 2016 and didn't include that
debt to Michael Cohen for the payoffs
okay
legally Trump is supposed to list that
debt the repayment of that money to
Michael Cohen if it did if indeed it
didn't come from campaign funds on his
financial disclosure he didn't do it
Trump says in the interview he knew
about the payments and he made the
payments himself that doesn't show up on
paper anywhere was this one of these
infamous elusive perjury traps set up by
Ainsley Earhardt I don't think so I
think Trump doesn't know what he's
talking about
maybe Ainsley Earnhardt let him talk for
too long you have to walk him through
the line of reasoning and the
questioning otherwise he's going to
admit to some really bad things Citizens
for responsibility and ethics in
Washington has already made a criminal
referral against Donald Trump that has
led to Citizens for responsibility and
ethics to demand that a complaint be
made and now the full story is that
there has been lie after lie after lie
from Trump on this so it actually could
be way worse than Trump even appears to
be admitting here according to Michael
Cohen Trump directed him to make the
payments in advance now if that's true
it's way worse than what Trump appears
to be admitting to here on the Fox News
interview you'll remember that Trump
first said he didn't know about any of
this stuff at all even recently he made
that claim now he says he did know about
the payments but only after and that
campaign funds weren't used the truth
could be anything and there's no reason
to think that we're altima to get the
truth from Trump I think it's gonna take
more work to get the truth
also Trump not shockingly doesn't
understand campaign finance law he says
Cohen pleaded guilty to something that's
not a crime can you imagine you get in a
room a judge prosecutors a defendant
who's a lawyer in Michael Cohen Cohen's
lawyers everybody in the room is for
familiar with the law and somehow you
end up having a guilty plea to things
that aren't crimes how exactly does that
happen you must have a room full of
moronic people who are accepting guilty
pleas for things that aren't crimes but
here is the most important part whether
or not the money came from Trump's
campaign funds it's a crime either way
if the money came from campaign funds
it's an illegal use of campaign funds if
the money for stormy Daniels and Karen
McDougal did not come from campaign
funds it's a contribution for the
purposes of influencing the campaign
above the legal donation limit either
way you're talking about a crime here
yeah Trump must be ecstatic now that he
was elected president because if he was
just a commoner if he had lost the
election he probably would have been
indicted by now because he seems just as
guilty as Michael Cohen is I disagree I
think if he had lost the election people
wouldn't even have paid attention to
this because he wouldn't have been
president and a lot of this stuff only
came to light because of Trump's
unhinged tweeting once he was actually
elected and people started asking
questions so I think you're right
he would have been more legally exposed
but it would have been less likely that
any of this would have been looked at
with such scrutiny wasn't Hillary the
one who's supposed to end up in prison
yeah that didn't happen did it maybe
she's still will I don't know eventually
they will fully shift to the idea of the
law as this kind of vague arbitrary
societal construction which it is at its
base right like that's what crime is it
it's great to be joined today by Thomas
Wood who's an assistant professor of
political science at the Ohio State
University also co-author of the
forthcoming book enchanted America it's
so great to talk to you today and I
can't think of a better time to talk
about the issue of conspiratorial
thinking and conspiracy theories we have
sort of this coming together of a long
history of decades of conspiracy
theories in America we have Q and on and
we also have conspiracy theorists like
Alex Jones being thrown off of some of
the prominent social platforms on the
Internet so so let's maybe start very
very broadly what is included under the
idea of conspiratorial thought and
conspiracy theories is it just stuff
like paul mccartney died and a similarly
sounding left-handed bass player has
been filling in for him ever since or
like what how wide is the umbrella of
conspiratorial thought so first off
thanks thanks having me on i guess
eric and i we approached thinking about
conspiracy theories as any narratives
which is all-encompassing which explains
a broad number of political events and
is supported by little or no external
evidence and so that is a useful enough
conspiracy theory to account for things
like okay you've alluded to so the idea
that Paul McCartney has suffered an
accident sometime in the 1960s and and
an artist has been imitating Paul in
recent decades through to more damaging
conspiracy theories the idea that
shadowy groups control us finance the
idea that the 9/11 terror attacks were
planned by it by elements with inside
the US government for political purposes
and so the one sort of thread that we
can use to join up all those different
accounts is there's really no or very so
weak evidence for any of these accounts
the absence of evidence is not really
enough to disabuse its followers from
believing in these knots another
characteristic that seems common is that
an absence of evidence or an apparent
absence of evidence is often taken to be
evidence because it's part of the
conspiracy in other words either there
doesn't seem to be evidence because the
evidence is being covered up by the
perpetrators of the conspiracy so on and
so forth and that seems to make it
particularly difficult to have sort of
critical thinking and epistemological
sound conversations with some conspiracy
theorists because whether there is
evidence or there appears to be or there
appears not to be it's all evidence of
the conspiracy so yeah I mean that
that's a very pertinent insight
psychologists have spoken about this
they've called these conspiracy theories
self-sealing that is they the conspiracy
theory has a thread to them which which
anticipates and responds to criticism so
for instance any time an academic
appears in sort of a public forum the
academic is instantly assigned or role
in the conspiracy and they're funded by
the shadowy groups that support the
conspiracy theory in and of themselves
and so in the past when Eric and I have
spoken about conspiracy theories in
public settings where described is where
funded by the Ford Foundation and we
enjoy all the access to the trilateral
commission for instance and I can assure
you like I had to move my bicycle from
outside of the shop before we have this
conversation I can assure you that I am
the furthest thing from any part of a
global economic elite to be making this
discussion but I just want I just want
to make one sort of caveat with that
discussion that definitely is have a
sort of the conspiratorial core sort of
interface with these conspiracy
narratives by the time these conspiracy
theories become public events and the
average American survey respondent is
aware of them I've actually got pretty
good experimental evidence which
suggests that those are folks with a
superficial engagement with the
conspiracy there are actually fairly
amenable to evidence so you can present
them with for instance with
you can show them pictures of Barack
Obama's birth announcement that was
contemporaneous you know that that were
that is taken from Hawaii newspaper on
the day of his birth and that turns out
to be very very effective at moving
people on this impression that Barack
Obama's birth is subject to a shadowy
conspiracy but yes when you talk about Q
for instance like Q is we're dealing
with a conspiracy and it's Mason stage
and those are folks for whom a regular
as you said epistemic engagement on a
scientific or at least fair basis
they're way too deep in the weeds there
be persuaded by that sort of evidence
one of the underlying sort of
psychological imperatives that I think
is connected to the desire to believe in
conspiracies is the idea that it's
somewhat more comforting to many people
to believe that everything is planned
and crafted and managed in a way rather
than to believe that random things
happen bad things happen we don't always
know the reason there's a huge element
of chance in how things go
number one do you agree that that is a
an element in people's belief in
conspiracies but what else
psychologically is underlying belief in
conspiracy so that turns out to be a
very important thread for the survey
evidence that we've gathered over the
last decade
where we went back and forth trying to
figure out the best ways to predict the
kinds of people who adopt one of the
panoply of possible conspiracy
narratives that are apparent in the
American political discussion at any one
moment and you've hit on something which
we found out to be a very powerful
predictor people who are anxious about
their life personally that is people who
wash vegetables when they go home when
they take them home from the market
people who lock the doors of their car
as soon as they hop in the car for a
drive across town people who manifest
those sort of anxieties and the
personalised separately people with the
mystique about American society people
who are very pessimistic
be subject to a terror attack in coming
years people who think there'll be a war
between the United States or China or
Russia people who think we're on the
verge of a recession those turn out to
be very influential predictors of
willingness to subscription to these
kind of conspiracy theories and we
suggest it's like it's tapping something
fundamental in human psychology that is
we are probably the evolutionary
descendants of those who were very
attuned to unseen threats that is on the
polyester scene after all the Bears who
were very cognizant of a rustle in the
bushes could be some predator like
waiting to pounce on our for isn't eat
them it was a very sound thing to do to
be very very cognizant of and attentive
to unseen threats as as threats to our
physical well-being there's probably a
good evolutionary story suggest why
we've selected almost threats and it's
really we like Eric and I like to think
about this as conspiracy reasoning
that's almost human psychology at its
natural state and so rather than having
an appreciation for random chance like
separate forces coming together and
resulting in horrendous things that take
place and really don't have much of a
logical explanation those are things we
have to learn and those are like we have
to sort of be but be made to be
cognizant of and attended to the
possibility for those occurrences and
absent the sort of the hard intellectual
work and natural state it's much easier
and much more natural to think of some
simplistic conspiracy narrative which
account for these separate events in one
encapsulated form the term conspiracy
theory is now being pointed to as part
of the problem by some conspiracy
theorists in other words there's this
idea that they like to say the phrase
conspiracy theory was created to make
people who question the official
narrative seem crazy or seem lacking
credibility or whatever the case may be
how can you address an issue like that
head-on or is it even worth arguing that
point uh
I mean so this is one of these
complicated things when I've done events
like this previously unbeknownst to me
I've often appeared with people who's
sort of business it is just sort of to
advance the particular conspirator sorry
but the narrative of the day and they've
insisted on things like no no I'm not a
9/11 conspiracy theorist I'm a 9/11
truther
yeah or I'm an I'm a I'm a Barack Obama
birther truther and so like those sort
of labels to me aren't that meaningful I
think Eric and I use this terminology
our research just because it's sort of
it taps into something that most
fair-minded people can see as broadly
implausible accounts of politics so if
that doesn't turn out to be that the
terminology that works for you in this
particular case that's fine and so I
think if it is the case that people get
upset by this terminology like eschew
the terminology and just look at the
nature of the story as its adherents
give it credit and there you'll see
stories that do sort of strain basic
credibility I mean I think one of the
problems you very quickly come up
against you know you mentioned at the
beginning when we were saying what
counts as conspiratorial thought what
counts as a conspiracy theory you
pointed to the lack of real evidence or
objective evidence the problem is that
the conspiracy theorist believes there's
plenty of evidence and it immediately
becomes a disagreement as to what counts
as a but it's like I've been the target
of the chemtrails conspiracy theorists
and even though there are significant
explanations of why you know what those
trails are that that follow behind an
airliner as it flies overhead it doesn't
really matter because they say no look
look look at all of this evidence and
then you're only arguing about what
counts as evidence so it seems like this
totally circular exercise in futility
well I'm guessing the people who've
appeared on your show or I've got
resumes the profile engage with you
those are people who if they are good
faith actors you sort of have to wonder
about their ability to engage unlike any
sort of scientific base
with other phenomenon and if they're bad
factors well then obviously no they have
a business interest in ginning up
anxiety and concern I'm not so sort of
equipped to provide you advice as to how
you should like become a public
intellectual like seeking to improve
public discourse I can only provide you
with indications for how the typical
American survey responded deals with
this right and there and there we can
see conspiracy theories are like you've
said they are a source of cognitive
economy and so they're not like learning
the minutiae of you know for instance
when the 9/11 conspiracy was a big thing
you know people would pull over the 9/11
report and the movement of individual
actors and everybody structural engineer
all of a sudden right exactly of course
and people stopped Wikipedia like in
degrees in like how steel flexes its
Center and a chemical engineering and so
no that does not describe how a typical
person who sort of just felt unease at
the active scene like massive terror
attacks in a major American city those
regular Americans were not becoming like
like sort of folk experts in steel and
fuel sources and sort of rust that might
be how people whom you met sort of
engaged the average American is thought
no this event seems weird and awful and
that like a small band of motivated
enemies of America could wreak huge
havoc and killed thousands of Americans
that just seems implausible to me it was
more intellectually satisfying for those
folks to believe that there was a
shadowy American conspiracy at work when
it comes to as you mentioned earlier
disabusing people of their beliefs
there's one question which Peter
Bogosian is a big advocate of it's
called the de feasibility question which
is effective with some political views
which is what evidence if I could
present it to you would change your mind
right do you think that that is a good
question for conspiracy theorists or is
it not a particularly useful one I think
that's
gosh is hard to say so let's sort of
bracket the question the folks who are
at the intellectual core of this the
folks who for whom their day-to-day
business is the propagation is
conspiracy these conspiracies I'm not
certain feasibilities writing for them
we've had some experimental success it's
just suggestive it was on a small sample
we asked folks who were adhering to
these conspiracy theories that have a
strong partisan Betty said just switch
the label so if you believe a conspiracy
theory about President Bush Obama or
President Trump make it about like the
other president and if that assails so
make make the conspiracy about
Republicans making about Democrats make
a conspiracy like Democrats making about
Republicans and if at that point if it
just something as simple as flipping the
partisan label makes you far more
circumspect about the conspiracy theory
people have some sense well gosh there's
probably a strong sort of partisan
heuristic I'm using my negative effect
towards the other side of politics to
stand in for something sort of more
rigorous appraising the evidence and
that turned out to be quite effective no
no I wouldn't be so likely to believe
this conspiracy theory about President
Trump if you told me it was about
President Obama four Democratic
respondents and that's the is to do at
least somewhat one other sort of
characteristic that I wanted to touch
base with you about is that you will
often see sort of an arbitrary focus
either on the big picture or the details
depending on which is most convenient
and what I mean by that is you'll
sometimes get a conspiracy theory and
skeptics will start picking it apart by
looking at the individual components the
micro components and saying component
one doesn't make sense component two
doesn't make sense and then when you
take apart twenty or different
components you say hey look none of it
makes sense the conspiracy theorist in
those cases will say no no you're
missing the big picture there are no way
that this broad story could be true
the inverse is also true where when you
question the bigger picture the
conspiracy theorist will focus in on
some individual unanswered questions for
example that may or may not really have
bearing on the bigger picture can you
talk about that a little bit is that
does that happen naturally does that
happen because of how people react when
put on the defensive or is that
calculated by the conspiracy theorists
so I mean it's all speculative you know
it's hard to sort of find enough of
these folks like the folks who are there
on the ground floor of these conspiracy
narratives the groups are so small for
instance when we when when conspiracy
theories have been born in particular
subreddits you can do analyses and the
folks were providing 90% of the content
95 to the content it's like a hundred
different user labels right so it's a
very very small band of folks who get
these conspiracy theories off the ground
I guess I would provide too speculative
answers to this question there's a
chance that these folks have sort of
stumbled upon the methodology that sort
of fairground
carnival guys who promised to close
readings that is you walk into a room
and I can tell you all these amazing
things about a group of strangers what
before we call cold reading right I'm
sure you like it's amazing they used the
identical psychic like style of
technology to talk for instance about a
good people one side of the room
somebody over here has a father called
Paul and the exact same rhetorical
strategies used to appear as if you are
in possession of private knowledge about
some group of people it's a very very
close and so and so it's also like that
the manuals on this and the manuals on
this are written by people who don't
believe that they have a mystical powers
they are they are using as a sort of a
carnival trick and so they're really
really impressive they're really well
done and really well-conceived they used
the same strategies when you are when
you meet resistance there are rhetorical
strategies to sort of tip to deflect the
conversation and realize like well as
you said a meeting opposition on a
particular expectation I had I can
rhetorically term is to talk about areas
where I think
I am better equipped in the folks who
have sort of risen to your level of your
prominence to talk about conspiracy
theories they either know this research
or though stumbled upon the strategy it
works for them element of this is really
unfair and a bunch of other
psychologists wrote about this in the
1960s they studied doomsday cults cults
who were comprised of folks who small
groups of people for whom the leadership
made specific predictions about the
impending doomsday next Thursday and so
infested Juran's colleagues said gosh it
must be the case that the the adherents
the core the leadership of this group
must be sort of they must be adherents
they must be believers they wouldn't
make contradictions that are sort of
readily sort of contradicted in a week's
time but instead it's the case that the
anticipation of the event failing the
group actually were stronger more
adherent to the belief more adherent to
the narratives when the predictions
failed when the prophecy failed like
because it was not maturity to affirm
the group's hard work and the aliens who
were going to attend the earth and
occasion this apocalypse understood how
much work we've been doing and and
because of because of the adherents and
beliefs that in this room they've chosen
to delay the apocalypse for a year and
that turned out to be a fantastic
selling point to the adherents and so
again I applaud you for making good
faith reasoned arguments but for the
folks who are at the absolute core the
absolute ground level of these
conspiracy theories we're dealing with a
different epistemic set of evidence and
I don't think that be responsive in the
way you anticipate yeah that's that's
that's certainly been my experience
we've been speaking with Thomas Wood
who's an assistant professor of
political science at Ohio State
University co-author of the forthcoming
book enchanted America Thomas a pleasure
speaking with you today and you too
thank you
we've got something interesting for you
today I am joined now by Jeremy
Montana's who is a former Trump
supporter who was actually featured on a
panel on CNN's new day on August 7th and
on that panel Jeremy explained why he at
one point did support Donald Trump but
since is no longer a supporter of
Trump's and since then he has been
accused of being a plant by the so
called fake news CNN and has even
received death threats from followers of
the president so Jeremy first of all
thanks for talking to us today
so let's first just figure out how did
CNN find you in order to invite you to
this panel of former and current Trump
supporters according to them I had
posted something a while back that stood
out to them as being a former Trump
supporter I have no idea what it was
that they saw but they wanted three or
six people on a panel three that support
him three that used to support him but
as I felt it I felt like I was the only
one there that actually did not support
him okay and when they contacted you did
they say anything about the specifics of
what you would be expected to say were
you coached in any way or was it
basically the premises you are a former
Trump supporter and you'll participate
on a panel just the premises that I was
a former Trump supporter and I would
participate on the panel there was no
training coaching at balls and were you
paid for the appearance I was not okay
good
so you show up at this panel and the
questions are relatively unremarkable
the people that still support Trump or
asked why do you support Trump what do
you like about about you doing that's
good you were asked about other elements
and opinions of why you used to support
Trump and white why you no longer do did
anything about the dynamics of the
entire panel feel concerning to you
inauthentic or did it seem as though
everybody on the panel was just giving
their genuine thoughts and feelings kind
of frightening
that these supporters have and what
lengths they go to to believe what you
know I consider their false news and
their fake news and it was very hard for
me to express my own opinions when
you're surrounded by basically five
Trump supporters because they're
constantly cutting you off and I made it
a point not to do that to any of them so
after the panel you start receiving all
sorts of criticism including that you
were a plant and death threats through
what means where most of the messages
coming was it through social media that
people find your phone number where
people showing up at your house with a
headline on their website that
specifically said former Trump supporter
calls president monster which is I did
call my monster and it went onto YouTube
and I started getting the defamation
they're being called a CNN plant and
after a crisis actor basically what
David hog was going through is what they
started doing to me I continue to do to
me and then I was starting to get death
threats on there which a lot of them
have been removed thank goodness but as
far as getting personal deference I
received a few sent to me by my own
email yes no phone calls oh okay so what
state do you live in and and did you
vote in and sort of would have been your
political beliefs for you know the pre
Trump era I've always been a liberal
Democrat I live in the state of
California and the reason why you're
probably wondering that I vote for him
in the first place yeah is because I
couldn't get myself to vote for Hillary
Clinton I'm gonna be honest about that
at the time I looked at her as a status
quo candidate I looked at her as just
being a moderate candidate I wanted
somebody that was more for the people I
looked at her as a criminal as being a
criminal
I just thought voting for a
non-politician might be the best bet and
it turns out was the biggest mistake
I've ever made that's interesting so you
saw Trump this New York City billionaire
as a guy who was more for the people
than Hillary Clinton when he spoke to be
a citizen because he didn't speak in
this I guess you can say prim and proper
manner I don't know I think it's more
also because this was probably the worst
you know set of candidates we've ever
had or especially in my lifetime so it
was a very very you know difficult
choice to make but what's funny is that
you know back then I used to think to
myself well you know I don't want to
ever have to say voting for Hillary
Clinton now if you're talking to me you
asking the same question it's the
biggest mistake I've ever made and I
can't go back on that were there any
issues so a lot of what you're talking
is about sort of the dynamics how Trump
spoke versus how Hillary Clinton spoke
and the sort of feeling whether one is
more or less for the people as you said
as a Liberal Democrat did you agree with
Trump on any issues he was basically
spouting out racism and what now know
I'm actually a I'm Hispanic
I grew up in Mexico for half of my life
but I didn't think I thought that once
he would come into office he would
change his too and I thought that he was
trying to just win a base over and that
he just wanted certain votes and I did
you know honestly I can't think of there
was some interviews I saw him say where
he wants to give you know healthcare or
make it for everybody and stuff like
that so yeah those issues I didn't agree
with because I believe in universal
health care I did I did not one minute
think that would become the nightmare
that it's become having him in office
but wait a second Jarrett so you thought
Trump wanted universal health care he
said in some interviews that I saw he
was either he was gonna change the
Bhalla cure but he was gonna make it to
where you know everybody's gonna have
some
than grade everybody's gonna have a
great plan you know and that you know
that's struck out to me because
universal health care is actually my
main my main issue and then it just went
down to the fact that you know I mean if
I want to be really honest about this I
can say that it could have been more of
an anti Hillary vote but I didn't I
didn't start my my what's the word
regret for voting for him entirely until
he started doing what he was doing on
the southern border that's what did it
for me so once it as you mentioned you
grew up part of your life in Mexico and
you're Hispanic once it got to that
point that's when you started to regret
your vote yes and not was it about that
you know from minions want you to
believe these kids didn't come with
their parents and whatnot you know I I
think that's nonsense and he may be some
dinner but that doesn't give them any
right to shove kids and cages and
separate them from you know it's
inhumane I can't believe that this
country has come to thatx you know it
reminds me of concentration camps
reminds me of what they did to the
Japanese during World War two and not
only that but his racism was just off
the chain even with Puerto Rico that's
an island that's home by the USA after
that hurricane he called them whiners so
that they need to help themselves how
they not have brown skin and had it been
a white island would he have helped them
I don't really believe he would have
yeah I mean I don't disagree with you I
guess what I'm trying to figure out and
what I find interesting here is well let
me couch my next question with this
first question how closely would you say
you followed the election up to November
of 2016
like would you say you followed the
election very closely or casually or not
very closely I was originally for Bernie
Sanders and then once Clinton us
basically rigged the primary again
that's you know we've got the nomination
that's all I feel about it yeah that's
what I started looking more at Trump and
watching his interviews and watching his
speeches and he just seemed like a
strong president he had a strong
presidential presence at that time but a
lot of this stuff has been vulgar you
know I'm never gonna deny that you know
well I guess what I'm was kind of
thinking you know you said that the
things that kind of broke the straws
that broke the camel's back for lack of
a better term were the reaction to
Puerto Rico and and then also what's
going on at the southern border Trump
said during the campaign Mexico's not
sending our best they're sending rapists
and criminals and some I assume are good
people he said he wanted to ban Muslim
immigration to the United States
I guess what as someone who says you
followed the election closely I'm
surprised that the the straw that broke
the camel's back was something that we
saw the entire campaign you know right
into the campaign maybe two months
before the election even happened and
you know I mean I live with pro-trump
you know people you know in my own home
who kind of convinced me to just give
him a shot give him a chance you know
see what he does and I believe in that I
believe in giving people chances and
seeing if they're gonna you know do
something good why did you apply that
same thing to Hillary Clinton right
because you you had some skepticism of
Hillary Clinton but at least on paper
her views were closer to yours what
about giving her a chance right I guess
I'm trying to understand how as a burnt
you know you and I both supported Bernie
Sanders originally yeah I'm trying to
figure out how your openness to giving
people a chance ended up with you voting
for the guy whose beliefs were the
furthest from yours I think it's because
of how just like angry I was at the
Democratic Party for snubbing Bernie and
I think I think that you know it was
more of some people have asked me you
know when it also and though would you
say that
was an anti Hillary vote yeah I would
say that it was but I did at least give
him a chance up to a point because I've
always said that I don't like him as a
person I never cared for I've never
thought that he was a good person but I
wanted to see you know how he might be
doing as a president cuz we've got
plenty of presidents that weren't good
people but that ran the country pretty
well but again if your complaint was
that Hillary didn't seem to you I guess
to say she wasn't a good person she
didn't seem for the people you would
think that applying the exact same logic
you did to Trump which is it doesn't
matter whether she's a good person or
not she might do good things and let's
give people a chance I'm I'm still just
confused how you got to the vote you got
wait
okay different dif so what about
applying that approach in 2016 why not
vote for Jill Stein for example or Gary
Johnson if the idea was not to support
Hillary Clinton you know I believe in
voting I believe it's our right to do
that let me ask you this as you know
there was talk during the election after
Bernie Sanders did not get the
Democratic nomination there was talk of
a vote a significant voting bloc that
were Bernie supporters who would end up
voting for Trump mathematically it was
not a common thing but you you actually
did it right do you know other Bernie
sapote supporters in California that
ended up voting for Trump yes you did
yes and what was their reasoning for
doing that it was it was anger with
Hillary Clinton was it more anger with
Hillary or
more anger with the DNC I think both
Debbie you know Debbie Schultz and just
the whole thing it was just a big mess
you know as far as people's feelings
because they you know people like myself
I mean I really felt like a person that
could have been the greatest president
in my lifetime that could have actually
helped people like me and when I say
that I'm talking about you know people
that don't aren't rich and whatnot I
mean really could have made a change in
a very positive change and I think that
just people were just sick of it they
were just tired of you know every single
every four years we get the same kind of
garbage on the White House and we really
wanted something different we wanted
real progressive change Wow
Jeremy after the CNN panel what was the
dynamic like with the other participants
most of whom are still supporters of
Trump did they say anything to you were
they angry with you or was a cordial no
we you know we became good friends for
the day that we were hung out afterwards
and we had a really good time you know
everybody went their separate ways in
the end there was no arguing there was
no fighting so it was a very it was
cordial I enjoyed myself
well the death threats are absolutely
horrible are you I mean I don't I don't
want you saying more than you're
comfortable but are are you taking are
there some that you feel need to be
taken seriously are you sort of taking
action about some of this stuff yes when
we BC on Univision and I took that very
seriously I made a police report on that
and the PD over in my city you know did
everything they could they came over and
you know got my information I gave them
a copy of the email and you know we just
went from there I mean they told me to
not be too frightened because it's not
frequent that I'm getting personalized
emails sent to me like that but yeah I
mean they actually said you know I
wished I knew I wish I knew were you
it's like you know I kill you myself
well I was writing wow we have been
speaking with Jeremy Montana's who is a
former Bernie supporter who voted for
Trump regrets the vote and then was
called a CNN plant for merely stating
that that is now a vote that he regrets
quite quite a situation we find
ourselves in in 2018 Jeremy
really appreciate you talking to me
today and telling me the entire story
I appreciate you thank you so much for
the opportunity in the honor
[Music]
the david pakman show at david
pakman.com i'm going to need us as a
collective community of critical
thinkers to think very carefully about
what I am about to report to you and it
relates to an interview that Donald
Trump gave to Reuters yesterday and in
this interview Donald Trump said that
he's worried that what he says to robert
muller if he agrees to be interviewed by
robert muller or his investigators as
part of this trump russia investigation
Trump believes that what he says to
Muller would be used to bring perjury
charges against him in that
investigation now let's look at the
wording that Donald Trump used in the
interview when he said this because this
is sort of the foundation upon which our
analysis will be built Trump said quote
yesterday so if I say something and he
Comey says something else and it's my
word against his and he's best friends
with Muller so Muller might say well I
believe Comey and even if I'm telling
the truth that makes me a liar that's no
good so the easy reading of this is hey
if you don't want to be charged with
perjury don't lie to investigators
federal agents period the argument that
Trump and his lawyers are making and
have been making is that Donald Trump's
statements will be unfairly used to
charge him with perjury Meany merely at
the discovery of any discrepancy with
what another witness has said Trump will
be unfairly charged with perjury so
there's two really important elements to
analyze here once is this concept of a
perjury trap and then the other is that
Trump is effectively pleading the fifth
here I want to talk more about perjury
trap because this is the the
misinformation around that has gotten so
ridiculous that we've got to pick it
apart but let's start with the pleading
the fifth thing here Donald Trump is not
literally pleading the fifth which lets
you not
if I against yourself in order to avoid
self-incrimination but what Trump is
doing is effectively it's like a de
facto pleading the fifth Trump is
worried that his statements will be self
incriminating fairly or unfairly Trump
would say unfairly so Trump is
considering not giving statements to
Robert Muller
now Trump has said time and again that
innocent people don't plead the fifth
remember this as just one example shoes
people take you in the Fifth Amendment
for people plus the guy who illegally
did the server you know he put in the
illegal server so there are five people
taking the Fifth Amendment like you see
on the mob right you see the mob takes
of it if you're innocent why you taking
the Fifth Amendment yeah so there are
many of these I won't play them all I
won't show you all the tweets it's been
applied to Hillary Clinton to staffers
to people in Trump's business past all
sorts of people that Trump is said if
you're innocent you don't plead the
fifth
so Trump once again if you aren't guilty
when law enforcement wants to talk to
you you talk to them and Trump is
violating his own standard here but the
reason why he would say he's violating
it is because here there is this unfair
desire to set a perjury trap against
Trump let's break this down first of all
what is perjury perjury is when you
willfully tell an untruth in a court or
investigation under oath this can
include to a grand jury this can include
to investigators perjury is the willful
telling of untruths you're not going to
be charged with perjury if your comments
because of lack of recollection or lack
of specificity or lack of detail simply
don't align with what another witness
said because perjury is the willful
telling of lies and perjury convictions
are difficult to get because it's tough
to figure out legally speaking or to
prove legally speaking that someone was
willfully telling lies so Trump's
framing that any accidental or
coincidental inaccuracies or conflicts
with what for example James Comey has
told Robert Muller will get him charged
with perjury are ridiculous at their
face because perjury conviction
are really difficult to get and
prosecutors aren't going to just
willy-nilly try to get soft perjury
charges in this way but the most
important part of this is not the
definition of perjury which again means
the willful telling of untruths a
perjury trap is a real thing but it's
prosecutorial misconduct prosecutors get
in trouble for setting perjury traps
even though it happens incredibly rarely
and there is a definition for what it
means to set a perjury trap a perjury
trap is when you call a witness in to
testify without any real suspicion that
the person has already committed crimes
solely with the intent of getting them
to lie under oath to make that the one
and only crime that you charge them with
perjury traps almost never happen at the
federal level and in fact no US federal
court has ever accepted a motion to
dismiss because of claimed perjury traps
period okay we already know that molars
team has been talking to everybody from
Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen to
White House lawyer dun began to
everybody in between about actions taken
by Trump that might constitute
obstruction of justice by definition
that already means the perjury trap
accusation would be bogus if trump
perjures himself it is not a trap set
without any reason to think Trump may
have already committed other crimes
Trump is part of this because he may
have committed other crimes perjury
traps are when you have nothing on
somebody and you want to get them to
perjure themselves it simply doesn't
apply here yeah it is bogus but it's
what the Trump lawyers have to go with
this has to be their strategy because
Trump is a pathological liar I mean he
just speaks that way he speaks in
hyperbole so there's no way he could go
into an interview with robert muller and
not come out of it having told 10-plus
live and it's not even the hyperbole
it's that he thinks he's smarter than
everybody else and they won't be able to
figure out whether he's lying and
unfortunately even though I'm telling
you don't fall for the perjury trap
nonsense and there are some other
journalists telling you don't fall for
the perjury trap nonsense Rudy Giuliani
is doing a really good job of spreading
the nonsense and people are starting to
buy it they are starting to believe that
a perjury trap is being set for Donald
Trump here when it literally does not
apply to the circumstances by the way
also notable Trump said in the same
interview with Reuters that if he wanted
to he could take over the Moller
investigation but he's choosing not to
Trump said quote I can go in and I could
do whatever I could run it if I want but
I decided to stay out I'm totally
allowed to be involved if I wanted to be
so far I haven't chosen to be involved
I'll stay out legally I mean who knows
if that's the case I don't I'm worn out
from the perjury trap debunking that I
don't even have the energy to get into
that part he wants the Russian officials
to also investigate their own meddlings
yeah we can have Trump and the Russians
investigate Trump Russia that'd be great
Putin made an incredible offer which is
that Trump can partner with Russians and
they together can investigate
I guess themselves because they are the
ones at this point suspected of the
wrongdoing okay yesterday I told you
about this book which claims that Donald
Trump is a Mafia owned Russian asset the
book is called house of Trump house of
Putin the untold story of Donald Trump
and the Russian mafia it's by
investigative journalist Craig Unger and
one claim made in the book among many is
that
Unger said to Newsweek during an
interview about the book that he has a
reason to believe there's a Russian
asset in the White House who Unger
believes is an actual Russian agent but
that part is not 100% clear but at
minimum that there is a Russian asset
working at the White House that is tied
to Russian intelligence I don't know if
the story I'm about to tell you is
related to Craig angers book or not it's
not clear whether this is the person
that Unger was thinking about or talking
about but Democrats in the House of
Representatives are now investigating
national security adviser John Bolton's
ties to the same suspected Russian spy
Marie abou Tina who was recently
indicted and this is just a stunning
convergence of multiple angles of the
Fiasco that is the Trump administration
and I'm gonna do my best to break it
down for you because it's starting to
get very convoluted we've got Part A
which is Craig angers claimed that
there's a Russian asset working at the
White House
Part B from a few weeks ago is that
Maria boo Tina was indicted for being an
unregistered foreign agent
and for conspiracy to act she is
believed to be an agent of the Russian
government working in the United States
on Russia's behalf without properly
disclosing it
we learned that booty nough got access
not only to high-level executives at the
National Rifle Association which has
been a possible and likely conduit of
Russian money to the Trump campaign boo
Tina also got access to officials at the
Federal Reserve boo Tina got access to
officials at the Treasury Department and
to at least one congressman that we know
about our friend congressman Russia as I
know him Dana Rohrabacher a Republican
from California what we now have our
Democratic congressman Elijah Cummings
and Stephen Lynch who want documents
from chief of staff John Kelly related
to whether John Bolton reported his
previous work with this alleged Russian
spy on his security clearance forms or
on other White House vetting materials
it's suspected that the current national
security adviser to the President of the
United States john bolton
trump's third NSA by the way is tied
directly to suspected Russian spy maria
boo tina through a video that bolton
participated in for a booty 'no
organized gun rights roundtable
promoting gun rights in russia
this actually was reported months ago by
NPR this was in March of 2018 at the
time bolton wasn't yet the national
security adviser he became national
security advisor in april and the
details reported by NPR did not get as
much attention as they probably should
have and what we now know is that in
2013 john bolton participated in a
roundtable discussion organized by the
same maria boo tina who has been
indicted and what democrats are asking
for our documents related to whether
bolton discussed the contacts that he no
doubt had with someone presumably boo
tina if not others involved in that
group when he was invited and agreed to
participate in this russian gun rights
thing which by the way how who even gets
involved in
advocating for Russian gun rights I
guess the NRA wants it because it helps
them sell more guns for their clients I
don't know but every time you shake a
tree as I saw written on Reddit
yesterday a Russian drops out of it and
I what is the explanation going to be my
guess is if you ask me do I think that
Bolton put anything about the work he
did with this Russian gun rights group
and his contacts potentially with boo
Tina herself on his sf-86 forum my guess
is like Jared Kushner he forgot to
include that on the forum yeah I mean in
response they'll just deny everything
here and I think they can get away with
that especially because even I'm
skeptical about this connection in a way
because john bolton is a neocon and you
know his words and actions haven't
exactly been pro-russia throughout the
years sure like he supports regime
change in Syria which of course Putin in
Bashar al-assad are aligned he also said
that the 2016 election meddling was an
act of war and that the u.s. negotiates
with Russia at its peril so I'm gonna
hold out judgement for now well then if
there's no reason to hide these contacts
I'm sure that they are on his sf-86 form
right yeah I'd love to see that si form
yup
I think they're probably not on there
and this is listen this is just Trump's
national security adviser he mostly gets
coffee and makes dinner reservations for
people on Trump staff this is not like a
oh wait a second it's the National
Security Advisor
yeah that's pretty serious so let's get
those records but I don't think anybody
will be surprised if the sf-86 forum is
missing any reference to this
organization or to Maria boo Tina or
whoever his contact was and what I want
to remind you of it's now gonna have to
become a daily reminder Pat's furious
with me that I'm doing this but it has
to be a daily reminder
nothing will happen unless Republicans
lose control on November 6 2018
period let's make it happen let me know

the door now take the discount by all
means I welcome people who take the
discount I have been very critical of
Alexandria Acacio Cortese when she
doesn't know stuff or when she says
things that don't make sense and have
actually been so critical of her that
people in the audience have written to
me and they said David you're not being
fair to her even if she's not an expert
on every issue she has the right ideas
and we should support her because she
will learn by doing so my point in
pressing the story with that is to
remind you that I am by no means an
irrational knee-jerk defender of
Alexandria Casio Cortes if anything I'm
the opposite I've been critical where I
feel she deserves criticism she is now
being slammed completely unfairly as
some articles have put it for quote
banning the press from her events the
truth is that what Alexandria Acacio
courts has did is hold some town halls
in New York that were open to the public
but media was not allowed in this is
part of a listening tour that she did in
the Bronx
Queens that's where she's running and
she's being slammed for banning the
press she's being completely pillaged
for lack of transparency and these
criticisms I hate to break it to you are
completely ridiculous and absolutely
fabricated her response on Twitter to
this controversy was to say that quote
our community is 50% immigrant folks are
victims of domestic violence trafficking
and have personal medical issues this
town hall was designed for residents to
feel safe discussing sensitive issues in
a threatening political time we
indicated previously that it would be
closed to press this is a stupid reason
to criticize her if you want to go after
Alexandria Acacio cortes because she
said silly things about the unemployment
rate go ahead and do it if you want to
critique her because she seems confused
about the israeli-palestinian conflict
if that's what you believe then go ahead
and critique her for that if you want to
even debate the merits of a listening
tour have that debate okay I have no
problem with that even if you want to
debate whether closing events to press
is a good or bad idea as a campaign
strategy have that conversation but
having events that are close to the
press is just not a story and you
devalue your criticisms when you say
that this is tantamount to banning the
press or in any way censorship and it is
these angry irate people who are crying
wolf
every single member of Congress I think
everyone if not almost everyone has
private fundraising events there is no
press scrutiny other than general
scrutiny of we would like to know what
it is that they are saying to donors
behind closed doors and of course I also
would like to know this is a town hall
for constituents and the press is simply
not guaranteed access to everything
Alexandria Acacio cortes does criticize
ur where it matters where it makes sense
but this is simply dumb and you know if
you're outraged that a candidate met
with a donor in private okay well let's
let's talk about that if you're outraged
that an elected official Grit gave a
private speech somewhere let's talk
about that but this was not a Prescott
France and this is not even a defense of
her policies or her ideas this is merely
saying this is a completely manufactured
scandal you don't have to allow press
into everything you do and it's
perfectly reasonable to meet with would
be or actual constituents without media
in there and it is a devaluing of the
criticisms of Alexandria Acacio Cortez
to go after her for this yeah I mean if
Alexandria Ocasio Cortez never allowed
the media into her speaking engagements
then maybe we'd have something
approaching a scandal or if she allowed
MSNBC and Mother Jones into the room but
you know not Fox News and Breitbart
okay we could have that conversation
we're not approaching any of this stuff
there's just nothing here there's
nothing here and it is a total joke to
see people on the right but also even
some on the left fall for criticizing
her about this and it there are plenty
of things about which Alexandria Acacio
Cortes should be criticized and I've
criticized her for some of those but the
fact that sometimes she meets with
constituents or would-be constituents
without the media there is simply not a
story I have a completely surreal piece
of video to play for you our fearless
orange leader Donald Trump did an event
at the White House yesterday to honor
some officials that are in Border Patrol
immigration customs officials who did
great things and at a certain point
during this event Donald Trump brings an
officer on stage who is apparently
Hispanic and mentions in his invite for
the officer to come on stage that the
officer quote speaks perfect English why
is this even a topic of discussion well
we'll talk about that here's the video
and audio from Donald Trump Adrienne
come here I want to ask you a question
so how did you come to commit you're not
it's great to be joined today by Ken
Jennings who holds the record for
consecutive Jeopardy wins at 74 games
he's earned over four million dollars on
game shows and is now an author whose
latest book is called planet funny how
comedy took over our culture ken I have
so many things to ask you about
different things and and it's just
really great to talk to you so thank you
for taking the time that's a pleasure
thanks for having me so let's start with
a little bit of Jeopardy stuff so just
to let's get see if we can clarify some
of the very common misperceptions that
people might have about how the game
works you are not liable to be asked
about literally anything on a particular
episode the guests the contestants have
a sense of the topics that will be part
of a particular show is that correct
that is a very common misconception for
some reason I have no idea why people
think that but I think vast swathes of
America assume that the contestants know
what the categories are going to be on
Jeopardy on a given night and that's not
true the contestants don't see those
categories until the same time the home
viewers do and Alec says let's see what
the categories are nuclear physics
gangster rap and that's the first time
we've seen them now have you gotten any
study material even without having a
delineation of the categories or do you
get nothing it's just show up and
whatever's in your head is what what
you're going to have to go on absolutely
nothing I mean if you've been watching
the show for 35 years like many people
have you have some sense of the kinds of
things
jeopardy will ask the style of the
questions you know there's gonna be
presidents and world capitals there's
kind of a cannon but no you have no idea
going in on that day whether it's going
to be hockey or country music or the
franco-prussian war okay how much of
success on the game show depends on one
the the facts you have in your head
versus two the right timing for when you
buzz in I mean you can't win without
both you know somebody without the facts
has zero chance to win but the thing is
the show has a very tough audition
process like everybody there had to pass
a very difficult simulation of a
Jeopardy game so on any given night all
three of the players I'm Oh
to the players know most of the answers
most of the time and because of that it
really does come down to in practice it
turns out to be like 8020 buzzer because
everybody knows all the answers and it's
just who can get in first and is there a
downside to so I guess what what is the
secret to the buzzer timing because you
can't you can't buzz in too early either
right right often on the show you'll see
somebody just earner wailing away on
their buzzer and you think oh that poor
guy has things not working the fix is in
do they not like Canadians what's going
on and in fact what happens is you can't
just buzz whenever you know it you have
to wait for Alex to finish reading the
question or the clue and then at that
point some assistant somewhere flips a
switch and activates all the buzzer and
then your buzzers live if you buzz in
before that point you actually get
locked out for a fraction of a second so
when you see somebody doing this what
you're seeing is somebody who got so
adrenalin up they buzz too early you
have to be in this very zen state where
you hear Alex's voice died away you wait
like a brief syllable length pause and
then you just jam your thumb on that
thing as if your life depended on it
okay so as the wings start racking up
and I remember I don't know and remember
exactly how old I was when this was
going on but I do remember it as the
winds start racking up what is the first
sign or are there signs that the
producers are starting to say you know
that this we never really accounted for
a streak that was this long this maybe
isn't how the game is is designed to go
and then part two of the question is is
there a point at which the streak takes
on a life of its own and then it becomes
a really great thing for the show that's
exactly what happened this was a very
recent rule change about a year after I
auditioned when they called me to say
hey we have a slot in three weeks they
said oh hey we've got this new rule
change contestants are no longer going
to get retired forcibly after five games
it used to be kind of a Logan's Run
thing where you won five games they gave
you a car and the next night they had
all new people right and I was and I was
like oh well thanks for letting me know
but that is very unlikely to affect me
and sure enough that's what happened it
did the change had just happened a month
a few months ago I'm sure they kind of
wanted the excitement of a long streak
but maybe they were thinking 7 or 9
games it was a long streak I don't think
they were planning on six months
and the contestants don't get that you
don't get to chat with the producers
there's very strict security you know
because of the laws on the on the
federal books about rigging game shows
you don't get anytime face time with
anybody who might know the answer is not
Alex not the producers nobody who
actually runs the show so there were a
few conference calls where they wanted
me to do publicity where I could tell
they were a little nervous you know and
and I've since heard retro actively yes
behind the scenes they were terrified
what if I had just broken jeopardy after
30 years and at one point on one of
these calls I asked at what point do you
just like you know forcibly retire me at
what point do i dis Alexei alright Ken
we've decided you've been on long enough
and there's a long pause and they say
our rule say a contestant plays he'll he
or she loses right and and they had so
they had 48 I think shows of me in the
can before any of them started to air so
they've got months of me and they have
no way of knowing if people are gonna
hate it or like it right and when they
finally start at the area did kind of
organically turn into a thing Jeffery
didn't promote it but people just
started saying hey this guy's been on
for like two weeks you got to watch this
and then SportsCenter started covering
it and it turned into a thing and it
turned out to be very good for their
ratings but they didn't know that going
in now if they were determined to get
you off the show there are probably ways
that they could do it that wouldn't
violate sort of the structure or the
rules right like maybe I don't know
really figuring out what your unlikely
to know much about and stacking those
categories or I guess I'm just imagining
being a producer like if they said we've
got to get this guy off there's probably
ways they could do it without breaking
the rules or the law though they have as
long as they follow the guidelines that
they've given to all contestants and if
they you know generally follow they can
pretty much do what they want but that's
what they're independent there's like an
agency that little monitor stuff for
them and that's where they'll get told
just follow your guidelines and don't do
anything specific anyone contested but
in their case their practice was to
select all the material blindly and
randomly so it actually would have
violated their own practices interesting
to give like anti-can questions whatever
those are
and but there were a few things they
could do and they were smart changes
they made
on the playing field they came back from
hiatus and they had changed their daily
schedule of contestant warm-ups so that
the the new contestants the challengers
got much more time to practice on the
stage with the buzzer the practices were
rehearsals were much more similar to the
actual show interesting and that's what
the games did get a lot closer and I
felt very proud of that it was like they
had you know it's like widening the the
lane in the NBA for Wilt Chamberlain or
whatever you know right had to change
the rules for me that is fascinating so
now I guess we can start getting into
what you're doing now and I think a good
lead-in to that will be correct me if
I'm wrong but the perception I had of
how you started to be sort of
caricatured in media that reported on
the streak was as the sort of very
wholesome character and I don't know if
that was on the basis like of of
religion or your physical appearance or
your demeanor or what do you agree that
that's kind of like the character that
was built up about you independently of
like whether it's accurate or not was
that sort of the Ken Jennings of the
media yeah I think so I'm kind of an OB
looking guy I was a Mormon guy who I'm a
Mormon guy who was living in Salt Lake
City Utah at the time and one thing
everybody on Jeopardy generally seems
kind of bland and milquetoast you can't
really there's no way to create a
character of someone based on their
jeopardy appearances because most people
are the format does not lend itself to
any kind of showboating or character
work
so yeah insofar as people were writing
about me they were saying you know this
wholesome guy from Utah but I actually
was like a suburban dad from from deeply
Mormon Utah that was not too far off so
then I saw that when you now have you
have a Twitter account now I don't know
when it when it started but you have a
Twitter account and you also write and
on the Twitter account you sometimes do
make political statements or or make
comments about politics and it seems
like in when I look at the comments
people are like extra put off in a sense
if it seems like their politics don't
align with yours and I don't know why
like is the idea that because you you
were on Jeopardy and they saw you as
this very sort of narrow
question-answering guy that it's not
okay all of a sudden for you to have
political opinions or like are you
surprised by some of the feedback you
get when you make political posts on
Twitter I mean well
just part of Twitter is you'll have
athletes or comedians or whatever who
are like we shouldn't be separating kids
from their parents and you know every
conservative will be like stick to
comedy or stick to baseball or whatever
you know that's that's just the
phenomenon of public life we you know
you should have no opinions once you
decide to play baseball or whatever and
it's probably intensified in my case
just because Jeopardy's audience friends
old yeah so you have a lot of baby
boomers you have a lot of kind of
graying America including a lot of red
state Americans watching the show and
I'm sure some of them are like he seemed
so nice when he was on Jeopardy with
Alex but now look what he's saying about
our president you know so I think there
is some of that so let's talk a little
bit about comedy because your book
planet funny how comedy took over our
culture makes a lot of very interesting
analyses of what's going on within the
comedy world and I feel like lately
especially comedy has become such a way
to satirize politics and and sometimes
it's almost become comedy writers have
had a pretty tough job lately because
even their wildest and wackiest ideas
don't actually seem that much further
than what we're experiencing in the real
world what's your sense of the way in
which comedy and satire has worked its
way even into sort of the most serious
elements of society is that a good thing
or is that something that can make
serious issues seem not serious that
tire is very old you know the plays of
Aristophanes thousands of years ago are
full of sat there it's certainly not a
new idea to make jokes about the
government and we're not even in the
first age where people were like whoa
satire is dead things are too crazy um
you can find quotes of people Tom Lehrer
said that about Watergate in Vietnam you
know that you can't be a satirist in the
era of water day in Vietnam the stuffs
do crazy and I remember Conan O'Brien
saying that at the height of the the
Bill Clinton kind of star affair you
know like there's sex jokes on page one
how do we do how do we do comedy now and
what is unprecedented now is I think
kind of the blurring of the line between
politics between actual policy and
current events and what the comedians
are saying you have a generation of kids
getting their news from comedy show
and that has some unintended
consequences actually there's some
research showing that you know Jon
Stewart fans who got their news from The
Daily Show you know I think he was
trying to he was a passionate man trying
to inspire people to take a point of
view and point out problems in the world
using humor and instead what happened is
he made a generation of kids pretty
cynical people who watch that show were
very convinced that the media and
politics were broken and their response
from it was to disengage it did not help
voting rates it did not help political
activism yeah I mean I guess the one
thing it did do is they were they were
quite informed in other words there were
a number of interesting polls which
showed that they did seem to be closely
aligned with the facts to a greater
degree than somebody who was primarily
consuming actual serious news you're
bringing up sort of the second layer
effect which is well what did they do
with that information and sadly the
voting rates of that demographic are not
impressively high as you're pointing out
yeah it just seems like today when
there's such an abundance of satire we
can see that it's kind of impotent you
know we see a hilarious joke about Trump
online or you know some epic John Oliver
takedown and we're like yeah I'm gonna
retweet this I've done my part it turns
out that actually does nothing
you know activism might work voting
might work but really satire often is a
way for people to kind of blow off steam
and feel like they've helped which
actually benefits those in power it's
the it becomes a yeah a steam vent that
avoids actual pressure building up I'm
curious what you think about I mean I'm
trying to figure out the right way to
set this up but there's certainly ones
like right now we're in the middle of
this n-word controversy with Omarosa and
so on and so forth the use of the n-word
is an example for us is seen very
differently if it is satirical versus
not satirical and there are very
divergent views about that and even in
satire can anybody use the word or can
only some people use the word what's
your sense more generally about the idea
that discriminatory offensive or
prejudicial things that would not be
acceptable outside of satire become
acceptable merely by calling them comedy
like is that a good thing is it problem
matic in some ways I think we used to
give comedians a pretty wide carve-out
you know they were kind of a special
protected class we needed our court
jesters and so it pretty much was to get
out of jail card to be like oh that was
just a joke right so you'd have you have
comedians make if he jokes about race or
class or war or whatever taboo topics
and they could say oh that's just a joke
and I'm kind of glad we've reached the
end of that because it's kind of a
cop-out right I mean of course it's a
joke but it's an utterance it's out
there in the air like any other it
affects listeners like any other and I
think it's fair to ask follow-up
questions like okay Roseanne you said
you were joking boom what does that mean
to compare an african-american woman to
an eight like what did you think the
consequences of that are what might the
real-world implications of that be
because this is another area where there
is good research if you give a set of
subjects discriminatory jokes
disparagement humor they call it and
then you compare it to people who
received non-disparagement humor you
know light banal jokes and a third group
that received discriminatory material
that was not in humor form the first
group gets affected the most that's the
thing that will affect behavior
something about humor couching a
difficult idea or controversial idea it
within a joke allows it to seep into our
brains and maybe subconsciously affect
the way we act people who listen to that
material is more likely to react in a
discriminatory way when given follow-up
tasks so I think it's not a joke at all
and I'm I'm glad you know I don't want
to say it's the thought police now
because there is no such thing but I'm
glad we're examining jokes more to see
what their real-world impact might be
the book is fascinating it's called
planet funny how comedy took over our
culture we've been speaking with the
book's author Ken Jennings Ken really
great talking to you today oh it's a
pleasure thanks for having me didn't
it is great to be joined today by
christian picciolini who's founder of
the free radicals project host of
breaking hate on msnbc also author of
the book white american youth and his
story of leaving
neo-nazism and white supremacy is would
be fascinating to us at any time
christian but it is particularly
interesting and relevant given a lot of
what's been going on in the united
states for the last couple years so
maybe we'll start with your story i mean
you got into the movement pretty young
at 14 i believe how did that happen
what's the genesis of it
yeah and david thanks for having me on
um i was recruited when i was 14 years
old in 1987. i was very early uh in you
know kind of this version 1.0 of the of
the white nationalist movement that
we're calling it today
uh i was a neo-nazi skinhead in fact
that was one of america's first um
you know what led me there essentially
was i think what leads every uh person
to this movement and and that was my
life's potholes uh those traumas i think
that kind of nudge us from our path
and lead us down you know pretty dark
corridors
for me
it was a lot of uh
you know abandonment issues low
self-esteem
uh my parents are actually italian
immigrants so it wasn't something i i
was raised with at home
but because my parents are immigrants
when they came over in the 60s they had
to work very very hard and i never saw
them so they were gone seven days a week
14 hours a day and i really struggled
with
uh you know thinking
what i had done uh you know had pushed
them away potentially and and i was
never
you know really brave enough or knew how
to ask or to communicate those feelings
so i i kind of went astray at a very
young age um searching for identity
community and purpose and and not really
being able to find it
until one day at 14 years old i was you
know standing in an alley smoking a
joint and this guy pulled up in a car
and he got out and he had a shaved head
and he was wearing boots and he walked
up to me and he pulled the joint out of
my mouth and he said that's what the
communists and the jews want you to do
to keep you docile and smoking pot will
keep you docile so that then they what
take over or control you or society
exactly yeah it was it was their method
of control over us one of you know one
of their many conspiracy theories about
you know how uh you know jews were in
power to control and destroy the white
race through multiculturalism and
uh you know
the feeding of drugs into white
neighborhoods and things like that i
mean it was ridiculous obviously looking
back now but at 14 years old for
somebody who you know had hit a wall as
far as acceptance over and over and over
again and was bullied and felt very
marginalized when this man who was
america's first neo-nazi skinhead walked
up to me
it was as if he was offering me a
lifeline i didn't understand anything
about the politics i didn't understand
you know racism it wasn't
it wasn't something i was
you know even aware of because i lived
in such a small
bubble
uh meaning my my family's home i didn't
really go out very much i was kind of a
very solitary kid um
so you know it it offered me kind of a
way to belong and and it didn't matter
what he was selling i think i probably
would have jumped at anything at that
point so what i mean what was being sold
in terms of what were sort of like the
key principles or you know
talk a little bit about so you you get
pulled in somehow you're either invited
to come to some
meetup or group or in some way you start
building these relationships what were
sort of like the predominant themes or
ideas that were being discussed
well i mean at first it was it wasn't
about any kind of ideological beliefs or
even themes it was about just drawing me
in because of uh you know my lack of
acceptance in the past the savvy
recruiter uh you know and recruiters in
general recognize that that i was
vulnerable because of
uh you know my loneliness my
marginalization and they essentially
swooped in and offered me paradise and
then the types of things that they would
start talking about started off fairly
benign they would uh you know this man
who saw me in the alley actually after
he snatched a joint from my mouth
and said that you know went on to ask me
what my uh name was and i told him and
he recognized it was italian and then he
started to praise uh you know italian
and roman civilization as being uh you
know
great thinkers and warriors and and
artists and that i should be proud of
that
and you know being an italian kid
growing up in an italian neighborhood
with you know fully italian parents i
knew all about that stuff so i was very
proud of that
but then when he started to um you know
after he pulled me in through this sense
of pride then he started over time to
try and
say that people were trying to take that
pride away from me weren't trying to
diminish it and then of course went on
to name the groups of people and it
started with uh you know jews who who
wanted to manipulate and control you
know that was his his conspiracy theory
uh that african americans were uh you
know were lazy and only uh good for
selling drugs and crime and that they
were destroying our neighborhoods uh
which you know my neighborhood was
changing and i didn't see any of those
things but it seemed plausible to me at
the time what's interesting about that
christian is that there's this idea of
the fear of the loss of status right and
that underlies a lot of the resurgence
we're seeing in the last couple of years
around some of these ideas as well so
that that was a big thing you're saying
the fear of someone's going to take your
status from you
well well here's the thing i mean white
supremacists are very good at creating
the desperate conditions for people to
live under and then using those
desperate conditions to actually
create fear of them and place that blame
on somebody else so not only not only
are they creating the conditions but
they're feeding them constantly through
fear rhetoric and by blaming of the
other
and that's what's happening today i mean
we you know we hear things like
multiculturalism is is white genocide uh
that you know white males are
are being targeted as as uh
as you know the most evil people on
earth right now and and that their
identity is being taken away and you
know frankly none of that is is true uh
white males have done a lot of awful
things in our history and and i think it
deserves to be called out just like you
know other people have done awful things
uh you know in our history and
and uh it certainly doesn't paint a
whole species as as bad uh however um
you know the recruiters and and the
propagandists are very good at kind of
identifying these very
simple um
kind of
controversial talking points like free
speech
or white civil rights or the fact that
you know they claim that people can't be
white and proud and they use all those
things to kind of
pull out
[Music]
essentially pull out the racism in
people that was dormant
by making them afraid of something that
could happen to them but is certainly
not happening
how does the line get crossed and maybe
it's not so much a line but it's a
blurry area into
violence and the stockpiling of weapons
for a potential race war like in your
path how does the transition happen from
where it's just here's a group where i
can kind of feel not like an outsider
they're welcoming me where i belong to
the ideas that you just told us and then
go beyond that into actual violence and
and getting weapons and preparing for a
race war
excuse me uh you know i think it's about
desperation and uncertainty
the more we you know we people get into
these uh extremist groups because most
times they're looking for acceptance
they're looking for identity they're
looking for purpose
and while they may find those things to
some degree in these types of movements
what it actually does is it further
marginalizes them from society
uh and you know i think if desperation
and uncertainty uh
you know grow to a point where
a person feels that there's nothing that
they can say or do that will
uh give them any acceptance or
you know any sort of um camaraderie or
identity then you know the potential is
there if there are underlying issues
like mental health issues or um
feelings of revenge uh that can't be
critically thought out you know then
sometimes it does lead to that but i can
tell you that you know there's this
this whole notion that
you know we're calling white extremists
or white terrorists mentally ill and
that we're not calling them terrorists
and i do agree with that i do believe
that we we have to call white extremists
who commit terror terrorists but at the
same time you know
it's also true that we do tend to paint
uh most white actors in this space as
people who are mentally ill versus you
know people of color who are doing this
as terrorists right off the bat the
truth is is that mental illness is
really the underlying factor uh not just
for white extremists but across the
board um
i tell you about 75 of the of the people
that i work with um are either living on
the autism spectrum or with asperger's
or schizophrenia or bipolar and i'd say
95 percent of those people are either
undiagnosed or untreated
and i think that a lot of that having to
live with that you know not only does it
cause social marginalization growing up
uh you know maybe they were looked at as
odd or strange or or somebody that you
know couldn't
they couldn't be friends with that
pushed them away and the combination of
all those potholes those traumas i think
is what leads people to that desperation
and that search for acceptance in really
negative pathways can you talk a little
bit about the conspiratorial element of
it because even in the conspiracy world
generally there is this disproportionate
appeal as i think you say
to individuals who are struggling with
different emotional or mental illness
type conditions where they have maybe
slightly more of a propensity to be
pulled into some of these ideas and one
of the sort of hallmarks of
conspiratorial thinking is that both
evidence for and evidence against is
evidence for right the fact that there
is a piece of evidence that seems to go
against your conspiracy is part of the
conspiracy right either because it's
planted evidence or whatever we all kind
of understand how that works
does that take on a particular dynamic
within the world of white supremacy in
other words the idea that uh if you have
a counter example about jews aren't
really conspiring to do this or that
well that's part of the conspiracy
they're making you think that they're
not conspiring how do you even deal with
that type of thing
i don't i don't ever debate with anybody
about ideological topics i you know i
listen a lot
and and i i'm able to filter out that
noise of those conspiracy theories maybe
it's because i you know for eight years
of my life i used to say them and now i
they sound you know utterly ridiculous
to me
uh so i'm able to kind of tune in uh and
focus in on on those potholes like what
really led them there is it abuse is it
you know trauma is it mental illness is
it poverty is it extreme privilege
whatever those things are though that's
what i'm listening for i try not to to
engage you know into an illogical debate
even if i am using logic because it just
doesn't penetrate it has to be kind of
an emotional connection uh but to answer
your question i mean i think
you know there are certain aspects and
characteristics of people living with
certain disorders that that would uh you
know kind of foster unidimensional
thinking or a hyper focus on something
or a natural lack of empathy um and you
know and and i think the structure of
the movement the structure of these
conspiracy theories is very appealing to
people
uh who you know maybe see outside
stimuli uh as you know kind of like
noise that they can't uh settle
um
so you know this the rigid structure of
very black and white thinking the you
know the facts that are presented uh or
sorry the conspiracy theories that are
presented as fact
kind of provide some comfort i think to
people who uh you know might have um a
lot going on in their head that they
don't understand and uh it draws them in
it provides some answers to them
and you know it's i think conspiracy
theories are are what are driving these
movements and they have for you know
decades and decades
um you know and even centuries i mean
these tropes these kind of anti-semitic
tropes and
and uh you know
garbage science about you know race and
iq and and uh you know
ideas about
identity and misogyny things like that
are all you know part of these movements
and uh you know what scares me the most
though david is today
there are people out there very you know
famous podcasters and and writers of
books with new york times bestsellers
who are pushing these same types of you
know identity and
junk science tropes that are so
consistent with the white nationalist
movement that either willingly or or
sorry wittingly or unwittingly are
spreading these it's causing so much
damage and leading so many people
towards this movement that i'm not even
sure that they're aware they're doing it
yeah that's actually exactly what where
i want to pick up the conversation in
part two of the interview we've been
speaking with christian petrolini who's
founder of the free radicals project
host of breaking hate on msnbc and also
author of the book white american youth
and that's exactly where we'll continue
our conversation on tomorrow's program
we're continuing our conversation with
christian picciolini who's founder of
the free radicals project host of
breaking hate on msnbc
also author of the book white american
youth so in part one of the interview
christian we talked about how you got
into the neo-nazi skinhead movement and
some of the sort of characteristics of
folks that are particularly drawn to it
and targets for recruiters
before we get into how you got out of
the movement i'd be interested in
hearing a little bit about how you see
what's going on today we had the one
year anniversary recently of the
charlottesville virginia rally that led
to the death of one woman and many
injuries a rally about which the
president of the united states said
there were very fine people on both
sides including the side that included
neo-nazis and white supremacists do you
see
the current resurgence as directly
connected to who's in the white house or
is it more complicated than that
i think it's slightly more complicated
than that but i will say that
you know
the election did
uh kick over a bucket of gasoline that
was already that kind of ignited all the
small fires that already existed around
america
um you know i i certainly think that uh
you know we can refer to the statements
made by the white nationalists
themselves uh from david duke to richard
spencer to matthew heimbach to you know
many of the prominent leaders within the
white nationalist movement who came out
and said you know we've elected our man
you know we're excited about the
policies that he's implementing uh you
know from building a wall to a muslim
ban to uh you know tearing uh families
uh away from each other and deporting
them
these are all these are all white
nationalist talking points and they were
thrilled uh when uh trump was elected
president um
you know hate crimes have have been up i
mean the statistics are all there the
facts uh you know can't be ignored and
certainly some of the policies and the
words that he's used himself can't be
ignored so uh you know i i certainly
think it has fueled uh i don't know if
we'd call it a resurgence but it's it's
certainly uh it's bigger but it's it's
more that it's come out of the shadows
than it was trump did not create racism
my sense has been that there's not so so
much
more or new
white supremacists and neo-nazis but
there's more comfort in just kind of
saying that those are your views and in
demonstrating publicly do you agree or
do you think that there's actually
individuals who are entering the
movement as a result of what's going on
oh i think there are absolutely more
people entering the movement as a result
oh you do that's much worse than i was
hoping
well there you know the tactics have
changed and the platforms uh with which
they they reach people have have changed
so i think the internet is really
uh it's kind of like my digital alley
right uh you know for so many young kids
you know kids who feel marginalized
rather than going to smoke pot in an
alley like i did are now going to hang
out in chat rooms and in forums and uh
you know places like 4chan and reddit
and in those places they're starting to
see these very kind of benign uh you
know white nationalist recruiting uh
lures
uh like i saw you know things about
identity politics and and uh you know
black on white crime statistics that are
falsified and and even skepticism
towards the holocaust so it's not you
know the new wave of this kind of
pseudo-intellectual pseudo-philosopher
thinking that's influencing so many
young people both on the internet and in
real life you know they're they're not
calling themselves holocaust deniers
they're not calling themselves white
nationalists they're skeptics they're
scientists uh they're philosophers who
are just searching for the truth and
that's the way they hide uh you know the
today we're gonna play for you my first
of two interviews that I did it
at Netroots nation in New Orleans
Louisiana where I was last week this one
is with JD Schulten who's running
against Steve King the incumbent
Republican you'll notice that at one
point during the interview a second-line
band starts playing and that was not
something that we knew was going to
happen but we did the best to power
through my interview from Netroots with
JD Schulten I'm here with JD Schulten
who's running in Iowa's fourth District
against Republican incumbent Steve King
a pill battle for sure uphill battle but
what we're seeing is it's a lot of new
things that we haven't seen in years and
this race is going to come down to the
wire a lot of these races we're seeing
in your race we're seeing with Ted Cruz
and Texas and other races races where
the fundraising numbers are actually
pretty pretty solid for the Challenger
but in the end it's money it's
incumbency it's a lot of different
things let's talk about the money part
first I mean what's your approach when
it comes to the fundraising well I like
to it's funny you mentioned that race
because we find ourselves very similar
when you have such a an opponent who's
well known like that there's a lot of
people who want to get involved for
three consecutive quarters we've raised
money in all 39 counties in our district
and in all 50 states we do traditional
meet and greets to call time but we also
do a lot of digital and we get connected
with folks all across the nation and
we've been able to help raise him this
entire election cycle and in the last
nine months by a two-to-one margin
that's that's stunning I mean we know
that I think it's something like 85
percent of races end up being won by the
candidate that raises more money of
course there is the power of incumbency
as well but that's the I think one of
the advantages and tell me if I'm wrong
to being a challenge
against a very well-known candidate is
that the entire country maybe is more
aware of the race and has an incentive
to try to help out and get that
incumbent out if it's not a popular
person absolutely I mean nobody should
really know who the 4th congressional
district representative is yet most of
America does and and that's the thing
when he makes his off-color comments
which are more and more frequent I have
friends who aren't political who aren't
from Iowa and they they text me or call
me and say hey is this you and I like to
say that it doesn't represent us or he
doesn't represent us but representative
is his job title and I'm trying to
change that
what are your sort of big issues in the
campaign and for people who aren't
familiar with this this particular
district is very rural so that's it's
unique I mean there's there's role rural
parts of Iowa and less rural parts what
are the primary issues that that you're
focusing on and that voters are telling
you are important to them right
well it's interesting thing because
right now we're doing a lot of farm
forums or in round tables and as much as
we're talking about tariffs or low
commodity prices or trying to break into
more markets we talked about health care
and farmers are working that second or
third job or their spouses work in that
second to third job in town for
generations that hasn't been the case
just to pay for health care and I mean I
have no problem going into some of the
most rural parts of the district talking
about Medicare for all and people being
on board what the there's posit is the
positive response is it because the farm
community in particular has a deficit
when it comes to health care is it
because the idea of Medicare for all
specifically is becoming more popular do
you think even in rural areas I think
just the need is so desperate that
people are willing to do whatever it
takes every time I stop for gas I travel
a lot in
within the district and every time I
stop for gas most of the gas stations
have a donation box and it's usually
someone we've just gotten an accident or
got cancer or some illness and my goal
is to get rid of that I mean we live in
the wealthiest country in the world that
it's just we need to get to have a
system that doesn't rely on donations to
pay for health care and then people
relate to that and and I think wherever
you are on the spectrum
people feel that there's a need now I
mean we have decades that the private
industries could have done something and
this is where we're at and the need is
now and the need is it's boiling up
amongst most folks with a
medicare-for-all type proposal would you
favor something at the federal level
that would be paid for maybe through
like an income tax the way Bernie
Sanders has proposed there's other ideas
that would be at the state level there's
differences between universal coverage
and an actual government-funded system
what's your approach
honestly I'm open the meat is so I feel
so desperate that whatever we can do to
get there let's do it and I'm flexible
I don't believe that one way is the only
way and so what I like to tell folks
does I get I asked up quite a bit how
are we gonna pay for it well America is
four percent of the world's population
yet we're 41 percent of the world's
wealth somewhere in there is the answer
and would you so I mean let's let's talk
a little more specifically if the idea
was something at the federal level seems
more the more the ideas are at the
federal level than state right would you
reallocate money that is already a
government revenue or would you do an
additional income tax the way Bernie has
proposed honestly I haven't really
weighed exactly how we would go about it
but but I'd be open to either
I mean seems like the tax could be a
hard sell in some rural places right
like right but but also you tell them
like hey you're paying for it it's like
instead of paying for health insurance
if you're paying for for it to attacks
and and I think they get when when you
get something in return it's not as much
of the taxes as what they made new taxes
at that that mindset so I think they'd
be open to it and I mean we've talked
about that in several of these world
meeting Greeson and so I think people
are open to it
tariffs tariffs right now are hitting
farmers really hard they're hitting
farmers in the Midwest really really
hard and yet for the most part they're
sticking with Trump and that concerns me
a lot because at this point we would
hope that there would be some
repercussions and some consequences if
it felt like we were going to see those
I'd be more confident about the midterms
you're on the ground specifically in the
fourth District of Iowa how are the
farmers dealing with the Trump tariffs
well here's the thing as
even before the tariffs farmers have
been anxious and there is if we just
talk about the tariffs that that doesn't
really get to the root of the problem
and in that the bailout I like to say
that it's like you got punched in the
face and then they gave you an ice pack
like just don't punch me in the face
and it's not as big an issue but I mean
I'm talking to the port producers and
the dairy farmers they're feeling hit
right now where you see the row crops
the soybean farmers and the corn growers
like they can hold off a little bit to
the harvest but they're I mean they're
so anxious and so we've had four
consecutive years the low commodity
prices soybeans are down I mean corn is
down there three bucks a bushel and you
need needed about 350 to break even and
so farmers are struggling to get the
loans that they need and so they're it's
a lot it goes a lot deeper than just a
terrace but I all I see is that farmers
are anxious and they're willing to
listen where they haven't been able to
listen
what do you feel like they're holding
Trump accountable I I think there would
be when it comes back up there a little
bit patient but when it comes the people
like representative King he's not on the
farm bill committee the conference
committee and like if I wasn't an issue
I darn sure that I'd be fighting to get
on that community shoot the nail and and
fighting for the people in my district
and he's not doing that and that's what
they feed more than they actually
probably related to Trump Steve King is
I don't know if in cahoots is the right
word but he's associated with Trump in a
lot of ways is that helping him in that
district or is that at this point of
liability this it's actually two
completely different things I do it I'm
not the type of I don't limp I lump them
together I know a lot of folks do
because you think there's a man but I
could name probably twenty people have
to top of my head who are Trump
supporters who are a board of that and
so the feeling of fatigue is there with
King where Trump is still new they're
still trying to play it out a little bit
so Steve King and Donald Trump by many
voters seen as sort of affiliated on the
same page when it comes to a lot of
different issues in the district is that
the perception is the perception that a
vote for King is a vote for Trump and
support of Trump means you support Steve
King see I see it differently in the
districts I could name twenty people at
the top of my head who support us but
also still support Trump and so the
thing with King is there's a fatigue
that's part of this because for 16 years
he's been saying controversial things
he's been saying things that have put a
blemish on on the 4th district and and
it's just one of those things where as
an outsider you think would go hand in
hand but what we're seeing on the ground
level is they're two completely
different things
the rural districts often are sort of
misunderstood by people on the coasts
and big cities and there's this sort of
talking point that because the coastal
elites so-called just didn't get sort of
what's happening in middle America that
that helped Donald Trump win I don't
know that I even agree with that
narrative but let's sort of like think
about it a little bit is there something
about rural America that people who have
not visited those parts of the country
just don't get about the day-to-day
lives of people that infant impacts
their politics yeah I have a tough time
answering that question because I mean I
was born and raised there like I get it
I get what why Trump was successful
there I I understand like my district I
and the reason why they continue to vote
I don't necessarily agree with it but
but it's one of those things where in a
district like ours retail politics and
old-school style of politics that's what
works like as much as like the wave of
digital and all this stuff it's it's
door-knocking it's getting out there and
in Iowa we're spoiled when you want
let's say you want Joe Biden to your
birthday party barbecue you can get him
on a presidential year and so you really
got to get out there you can't just sit
at home raise fund raise and
commercials that's not going to win you
a darn thing it's getting out there and
showing how prove how hard you're gonna
work
prove that you're trustworthy and prove
that you're gonna fight for the people
of the district and you're gonna earn
votes regardless of their voter history
so in Boston where we're in a very
different political situation than in
any part of Iowa a big conversation
right now is how split is the left
democratic socialism versus social
democracy fighting centrist Democrats
versus trying to knock out Republicans
and how do you spread resources are
those even conversations in a place like
the fourth District you know when we
launched our campaign a year ago there
was that that's what that Bernie Hillary
split but I think one of the best things
that our campaign and the most success
that our campaign has is that we're an
open tent and and that we've been able
to bring both sides together and I mean
part of it is when you go up against
King I think people just want to beat
him and they're willing to accept things
but but I want a primary and I was
further left and the other two and so I
don't think that necessarily won me the
primary but being younger and just
having those kind of views kind of
people associate me with the left a
little bit more so it's I'm fighting to
be a Democrat in Iowa and you just look
across the Midwest and it's hard to come
by and so when you go to these national
events it's that that split and I don't
see it just because I'm fighting to be a
Democrat are there issues you have to be
more careful of as a Democrat in a red
state running against somebody who's
been there for a while whether it's
because on average the population is
more religious than in some other parts
of the country the issue of abortion
does gay rights even come up at this
point or is it seen sort of like as a
settled issue because of the Supreme
Court decision
I feel it's settled in Iowa we were the
third state accepted which was ahead of
its time and the first Midwest
I'm not running or to lose
I'm not running to hide I'm running on
Who I am and what I believe in and I
think that resonates more than kind of
being wishy-washy about an issue it's a
very religious district I'm Catholic
myself but you get caught in these
debates and it's not as black white as
what people think when you talk about
abortions and and my goal is to reduce
the number of abortions and that
something both sides can agree upon and
so I really don't view it as I got a
watch what I'm saying or anything like
that I just run on Who I am when it
comes to legislation what would be the
first three things you work on if you
want health care absolutely I would a
campaign finance reform that's the one
thing I can agree with anybody my
neighbor has a truck the size of Texas
as he caucus for Trump and as probably
five ar-15s we don't agree on too many
things but the one thing we can always
agree upon is getting money out of
politics and so so those are the two the
third thing some of the help our farmers
years and years of consolidation the
fresh and the stress that our that these
farmers have to go a year and you're out
I mean the terrorists couldn't come at a
worse time
an absolute worse time
and we're feeling it in our districts
well I think the band is playing us off
I'm mistaking with JD Scholten who's
running against the incumbent Republican
Steve King in Iowa's fourth District
great to meet you they saw mine
I want to talk about another angle to
this and then we're gonna move on from
the Trump and word tapes Fiasco with
every passing day almost with every
passing few hours we get closer to
confirming that Omarosa Manigault rump
is recorded saying horrible vile
disgusting things about black people
during tapings of The Apprentice is real
so we had number one the fact that
Omarosa claims Trump regularly used the
n-word and it's on tape to trump claim
that it's all lies and then three we had
this recording released where three
black Trump staffers appear to be
describing or discussing or debating how
to spin and provide context for
something really bad that Trump said we
then have as I told you just minutes ago
the press secretary Sarah Huckabee
Sanders unwilling to deny that it's
possible Trump is on tape using the
n-word about black people and we now
have sort of like a fifth or sixth piece
to this entire fiasco which is an
interview with the Penn Jillette Penn
Jillette of Penn & Teller Fame I guess
they are the illusionist magicians I
don't know what word they use what's
what's some political commentary thrown
in there yeah political magicians I
don't know where you want to call him
Penn Jillette was a contestant on The
Apprentice the reality show Trump hosted
five years ago and he also now is saying
Trump would regularly say absolutely
horrible things during tapings and the
interview was published yesterday in
vulture and it's really bad and there's
a couple key parts that I'm going to
read to you one is where he is asked
does Mark Burnett have tapes of
President Trump saying damaging things
during Celebrity Apprentice and pence
says yeah I was in the room and when
he's asked can you tell me what you've
heard him say Penn said quote know if
Donald Trump could not become president
I would tell you all the stories but the
stakes are now high and I am an
unreliable narrator what I do as much as
anything as I'm a storyteller and story
tellers are liars so I can emotionally
tell you things that happened racially
sexually and that showed stupidity and
lack of compassion when I was in the
room with Donald Trump and I guarantee
you that I will get details wrong I
would not feel comfortable talking about
what I felt I saw in that room because
when I was on that show I was sleeping
four to five hours a night I was
uncomfortable stress is the wrong word
but I
not at my best then at the end of the
day they put you in a room and they
bring out a guy Trump who has no power
whatsoever
and he's capricious and petty he is
actually being upfront here which is
yeah he said this stuff but I might not
get every detail right and the trumpets
would latch on to any minor
insignificant detail I get wrong to try
to discredit the entire story I've never
been a big fan of Penn Jillette's in any
way I've never found his commentary
super interesting I've never really
cared for his act but I don't want to
cloud that I don't want to let that
cloud the reality that he's being very
precise he's been cautious here about
what he says and what he doesn't say and
I think big picture he's a force for
good here he's a force in favor of the
world of skepticism and he's done some
good things and I have no reason
whatsoever to think that he's being
dishonest here yeah I think he's right
here because human memory can get muddy
too right especially because this
happened several years ago sure that's
why you know like eyewitness accounts
aren't the best pieces of evidence but
it's also not a denial - he's not saying
that Trump never used the word
no and he is saying that the horrible
things were related to both race and
sexuality so that is once again sort of
along the lines of what Omarosa is
saying but let's cut through all of this
right cut through Penn's assertions cut
through the speculation and the
conjecture and let's get down to what
matters if we ultimately get audio of
Donald Trump throwing the N word around
would it make a difference
he said racially insensitive stuff the
entire campaign he made fun of disabled
people he slammed the parents of dead
military service members he talked about
his own penis size during debates he
talked about grabbing him by the
and assaulting women by using his
celebrity power and he won anyway right
people already voted for him despite his
regularly saying horrible things is it
really actually going to change anything
if there's an word tapes of Trump I
don't think so I don't think so either I
mean in an alternate universe where
Bernie Sanders is president and there's
a tape of him saying the n-word yeah
that could take him down to his
resignation but with Trump there's
already a track record of racism like
it's already baked in we already know
who Trump is yeah but Trump was a
Democrat when he
those things I can't say it with a
straight face last thing prepare for
Penn Jillette to be attacked to some
wacky left-wing liberal he's not he's a
longtime small government libertarian
he's associated with the right-wing
libertarian Cato Institute he's no
liberal they might try to smear him as
one but he's not and the last and most
important thing to consider why would
mark burnett the producer of The
Apprentice if he has these tapes not
have release them I can't think of any
good answers other than he knows or
suspected that they would have been
damaging to Trump and he wanted to
protect Trump and that's something that
should scare us all because I believe
that it would be his responsibility if
he had these recordings to put them out
there if there was the time to release
them it would have been in the heat of
the 2016 election cycle it may be
shortly after the Access Hollywood tapes
but we I don't know what his politics
are at the same time you know the best
time to plant the tree is 20 years ago
the second best time is today the best
time to release him would have been
before Trump was elected the next best
time is right now and I hope that he
does that if he's got him I'm on Twitter
at D Pakman the show is on Twitter at
David Pakman show fantastic program for
you today and I'm glad you're with us
this might come as a shock to you but
Vice President Mike Pence said that the
president should resign over his lies
about his adultery truly shocking
revelation except he didn't say it about
the current president when I mean that
Mike Pence said the president should
resign over his lies related to
infidelity he was talking about Bill
Clinton at the time apparently when it's
Trump it no longer matters and this is
the same Mike Pence who's so pious and
so moral and so Christian such a good
Christian that he won't have dinner
alone with another woman it needs to
have a chaperone there and there's been
a bunch of old columns by pence that
have come to light and of course he's
talking about Bill Clinton here but
wouldn't it apply five times more to
Donald Trump pence wrote who knows what
year if you fall and I fall into bad
moral habits we can harm our families
our employers and our friends the
President of the United States can
incinerate the planet seriously the very
idea that we ought to have at or less
than the same moral demands placed on
the chief executive that we place on our
next-door neighbor is
ludicrous and dangerous throughout our
history we have seen the presidency as
the repository of all our highest hopes
and ideals and values to demand less is
to do an injustice to the blood that
bought our freedoms and then the
goldmine calling for the resignation of
the president for lying about adultery
not this president the previous
president of course saying our leaders
must either act to restore the luster
and dignity of the institution of the
presidency or we can be certain that
this is only the beginning of an even
more difficult time for our land for the
nation to move on the president must
move out he's also on audio visual
recordings saying very similar things
take a look at this is adultery no
longer a big deal in Indiana and in
America and just love to know your
thoughts cuz I I for one believe that
the seventh commandment contained in the
Ten Commandments is still a big deal
it's the most important promise you'll
ever make
and holding people accountable to those
promises and holding people accountable
to respecting the promises that other
people make to me what what could
possibly be a bigger deal than that in
this country if only he would hold the
current president to that standard and I
point this out not to actually have a
conversation about hypocrisy but to
point out that it's all bs what I mean
is political positions public personas
political issues making something a big
deal or not a big deal this is all cover
for what we've seen happen bigger
picture in the United States for the
last 30 to 40 years which is that
corporations increasingly control
government and our lives and this is
sort of the other side to the Trump
Fiasco on the one hand we have to report
on the day to day of the Trump
administration the hypocrisy from
everyone around him like Mike Pence in
this clip the lies the corruption with
Russia the possible obstruction of
justice and crimes it's all real and
it's all happening but the backdrop is
that behind the micro of the political
theater is that the Trump administration
didn't just appear out of nowhere
we have a very flawed democracy and I
don't mean just like how we count votes
first-past-the-post
I mean our political system for decades
has been dominated by the false
dichotomy of Democrat versus Republican
when it's been two parties that allowed
corporate power to build where the
individual now barely counts and yes all
the time I tell you Democrats and
Republicans are different on many issues
what the minimum wage should be net
neutrality important differences and
we've got to vote the current regime out
in November but elected officials from
both parties for decades stand aside
they benefit from the status quo no one
gets the corporate and dark money out of
politics and I question of course
whether any of them want to since the
status quo got them elected and then the
majority of the political debate is
playing to the narrow debate where there
is no real questioning of the systems
that got us here at large campaign
finance yes that is a meta questioning
of the system and people are doing it
some people are doing it but not in a
way where the protests and the civil
disobedience are actually going to
change what's going on
how did Trump win the Republican primary
okay that's an important question do his
supporters realize that they've been
bamboozled maybe they do maybe they
don't
it matters but the big issue is how
corporate power has subjugated both
Democrats and Republicans none of that
would have changed whether it's Hillary
or Trump major consequences between
Hillary versus Trump which Wars will be
started how many lives will Trump ruin
but the status quo pushes ahead and this
pens hypocrisy about resignation based
on lying about infidelity it's just
another data point that it is all
political posturing 95% of what we hear
from our elected officials on both sides
is political posturing Pat there may be
tapes oh lordy it seems that there might
be tapes I haven't talked about this
story on the regular show because
there's been a lot of conjecture and a
lot of speculation but it is very
quickly becoming a real story and I do
want to talk about it now and it relates
to Omarosa Manigault our she recently
wrote a book one of these salacious
tell-all type books where she claims
that there are recordings of Donald
Trump using the n-word
this wouldn't be hugely surprising like
I I don't I don't know that many people
in our audience who
be shocked to hear tapes of Trump using
the n-word but Donald Trump has been
denying that he uses the n-word never
mind they're being recordings and
initially there was this very aggressive
smear campaign against Omarosa and it
worked pretty well because there was a
contradiction in her tell-all memoir
she said tapes exist of Trump using the
n-word but I haven't heard them more
recently she changed her mind and she
said oh I have heard the tapes and this
appeared to be a contradiction but she's
explained it by saying no when I you
know I wrote the book some time ago at
that point I hadn't heard the tapes now
I have heard the tapes and that's a
plausible enough explanation but this
hasn't stopped the Trump administration
and Trump himself from going into full
denial and smear mode calling Omarosa
all sorts of things
here's Trump on Twitter denying that he
has ever used the word the the n-word
that is just not in his vocabulary he
tweeted yesterday Mark Burnett called
he's the producer of The Apprentice to
say that there are no tapes of The
Apprentice where I used such a terrible
and disgusting word as attributed by
wacky and deranged Omarosa I don't have
that word in my vocabulary and I never
have she made it up look at her many
recent quotes okay and he goes on from
there but that's the relevant part so
now the narrative begins to fall apart
step one was yesterday
when a recording was leaked of Omarosa
being fired by White House chief of
staff John Kelly and that confirms
merely that recordings exist that
Omarosa has right all we learned from
that is that Omarosa has tapes and it's
not completely out of the realm of
possibility that she has more than one
tape people who record conversations
with others probably don't do it just
once so yes we at least know that it's
it's plausible that Omarosa has or has
access to tapes the big story happened
this morning where a recording was
released and what the recording
supposedly contains which I'm about to
play for you our trump staffers during
the campaign talking about how to manage
or spin
trump's use of the n-word CBS has
obtained this audio what we are told
this is
is a conversation involving Omarosa and
remember Katrina Pierson and other Trump
staffers figuring out how do we spin
what Trump said which is presumed to be
the n-word
take a listen then described a
conversation she had with then-candidate
Trump about making the slur so this is
just part a it's not proof that this was
about the n-word but it is about
something Trump said and the three
people involved here are I think we
determined Katrina Pierson is black
right it's true three of trumps black
staffers which of course again is not
proof of anything but the lies are
racking up because yesterday Katrina
Pierson claimed on Fox News that this
call never even took place that she
never participated in a call like this
and now 12 hours later we have audio of
the exact type of conversation that
Katrina Pierson that claimed never
happened so this is building pad and
slowly but surely in this drip drip drip
method we're getting closer to
confirmation of exactly what Omarosa is
claiming here yeah I mean everything
Elmer osis says you have to take with a
grain of salt especially now because
she's trying to sell her books yeah but
she said on Meet the Press that the tape
could be saved for an October Surprise
and I don't know if that's this October
or tomorrow morning 20 but yet that
would be highly damaging it could hurt
his poll numbers for a whole week and I
think your your point about what we'll
talk about the impact does this mean
Omarosa is a great person who we should
all love and trust no and she never
should have been working at the White
House but more and more elements of this
particular story are being proven true
in Trump's now furious at Omarosa which
is so funny because when you hire
someone that you know to be crazed
erratic
backstabber to work for you how are you
then shocked and angry when she ends up
being erratic and backstabbing you again
yeah he fired her three times on the
apprentice and then once from the White
House but Trump was supposed to hire the
best people that's not happening and I
actually am interested in how do you
spin like let's assume they're
discussing how to spin use of the n-word
how do you spin it you say he was
talking about the country of Niger it
was a conversation about African
diplomacy and he just had like a verbal
typo or a Freudian slip of some kind
he said he was quoting rap lyrics
right there was no ER on the end this
was merely him talking about the rap
songs it like ha what kind of context
can you even invent to make this
reasonable from Trump's usage there
would be no excuse for him saying it at
all but I mean the context would matter
like is he using it like how Bill Maher
use I don't think back verses and you
know an insulting way like there are
there are differences there context can
make it as we talked about yesterday on
the story about race baiting where mere
use of the n-word is not necessarily
racist discriminatory prejudicial
whatever Trump just doesn't have a
history of discussing race relations in
ways or I would imagine some benign
usage of the n-word last thing you can
tell how likely it is this is true by
how horrible the things Trump is saying
about Omarosa are and he's now calling
her a lowlife dog he treated this
tweeted this morning quote when you give
a crazed crying lowlife a break and give
her a job at the White House I guess it
just didn't work out good work by
general Kelly for quickly firing that
dog the more insulting Trump is the more
likely historically we've seen proven he
is to know that the allegations are true
send me your thoughts I'm on Twitter at
D Pakman the show is on twitter at david
pakman show will we ever get the N word
tapes do you think that they exist let
me know I am going to submit for your
review today what I believe could be the
most shameful moment of the Trump
administration so far and it's an
interview of Katrina Pierson appearing
on Fox News and straight-up lying to Ed
hen
his face repeatedly boldly confidently
about known facts that are on audio
recording so let me catch you up about
all this this relates to the Trump
n-word recordings which seem to be
bringing out the absolute worst pathetic
lying in everybody who's surrounding
Trump
it started when former Trump staffer
Omarosa Manigault rump using the n-word
when talking about black people and she
also specifically said that Trump
campaign advisor Katrina Pierson is on
one of these recordings talking about
how should they spin how can they spin
Donald Trump's use of the n-word Katrina
Pierson appeared on Fox News Monday
night I've already told you about this
and when she appeared on Monday night
she said no such tape exists no I was
this video was made possible by our
friends over at class
- central.com / Pakman click the link
under this video to get access to
thousands of lectures from the world's
top universities many of which are
totally free whether you realize it or
not you might believe in some of the
superstitions I'm going to discuss with
you today we could define superstitions
as irrational beliefs that an object or
behavior has the power to influence an
outcome where there's no logical
connection between them very often
people believe superstitions for
underlying sort of pseudo scientific
reasons but there's also evidence that
suggests superstitious behavior is found
among all sorts of species and it might
even have been evolutionarily beneficial
in 1947 famed psychologist BF Skinner
performed an experiment which would
later become known as the superstition
experiment where he put hungry pigeons
under supervision and had the machine
fed at regular time intervals and over
time 75% of the pigeons started to
exhibit sort of ritualistic behavior
like they believed whatever action they
took before the feeding might have
caused the feeding to take place and
this was the first experiment to suggest
that it's not just humans that have
tendencies towards superstitious type
behavior evolutionary psychologist
suggests that superstitious behavior is
an inevitable feature of adaptive
behavior and that every organism could
be subject to it and they've theorized
that superstitious behavior usually has
little downside and the intuition behind
it might help survival in a few
different ways so the suggestion is that
being slightly superstitious is almost a
natural part of life for many species
and in fact sometimes it could have
benefits psychologists at the University
of Cologne and Germany found in a recent
study that Goodluck charms
can improve performance though the good
luck of these rituals and objects is
likely confirmation bias you
member when it works and attribute it to
the superstition when it doesn't work
you attribute it to something else
superstitions can also lead to a false
sense of security and that's been
observed in a study of South African
taxi drivers superstition in drivers was
positively related to the number of
accidents that they had been involved in
but instead of looking at the value of a
good luck charm or of taxi drivers in
South Africa I'm gonna focus in this
episode on some of society's most
colloquial and common superstition so
fear of the number 13 666 walking under
a ladder breaking a mirror opening an
umbrella inside blackcats spilling salt
saying god bless you' wishbones crossing
your fingers and knocking on wood so
let's get right into it
the number 13 has special significance
in our culture so much so that fear of
the number 13 has its own name
triskaidekaphobia
Hotels often have no 13th floor I guess
that's not really true they they have no
floor that they call the 13th there's
still a floor above the 12th no matter
what you call it but they don't have a
floor numbered 13 airports tend not to
have gate number 13 Friday the 13th is
easily the most superstitious day of the
year and like many of these
superstitions it's not exactly clear
where our aversion to the number 13
comes from but there are a few different
ideas one possibility is that there were
originally 12 people with Jesus at the
Last Supper Judas was the 13th disciple
to join Jesus that night and soon after
he would go on to betray Jesus in the
ancient Persian religion of
Zoroastrianism the number 13 has been
considered sinister and wicked for
thousands of years it's also been said
that there were 13 steps to the gallows
12 going up and one going down thomas
fern slur who works in the math and
science education research center at the
university of delaware says that 13 has
this awful place in our collective
imaginations simply because it comes
after 12 12 is a perfect number
mathematically and historically
significant the twelve gods of Olympus
12 months of the year twelve hours of
the clock twelve tribes of Israel
twelve apostles of Jesus it's all
arbitrary but there are these numbers in
human history but is there actually any
power in the number thirteen seems
extremely unlikely that thirteen holds
any significance outside the one we
suppose presuppose it to have in a few
cultures it's even thought of as
bringing luck not misfortune 666 is a
highly stigmatized number in culture
similar to 13 in its mystique 666 is
connected to the Bible specifically the
New Testaments book of Revelation it
refers to the number or name of a wild
beast whose relation with Satan and the
Antichrist is sort of unclear who's the
harbinger of the biblically foretold end
times rings of Bell based on some of the
interviews we've done it's not totally
clear what exactly 666 refers to is that
the name of the beast is it a number
associated with the length of the beasts
reign on earth or is it a cryptic
message to persecuted Christians living
in the Roman Empire as usual there is
not a clear answer from the Bible the
number of the beast is given in
Revelation 13 15 to 18 this part of the
Bible was likely written during the
reign of Nero the Roman Emperor and when
looking at his translated name in Hebrew
the letters which in Hebrew can also
have numeric values add up to 666 so
this sort of hints at the possibility
that this passage was code to Christians
at the time telling them that the Roman
Emperor and therefore the whole state by
extension was under a demonic Antichrist
influence people often caution others
about walking under ladders it's a smart
policy to be extra alert around ladders
regardless of good or bad luck because
someone might be on the ladder but
walking under it according to some
superstition has dangers associated with
it beyond just the risk of immediately
getting hurt and I'm referring of course
to the idea that walking underneath a
ladder causes bad luck in ancient Egypt
priests would sometimes Lee
ladders in tombs because it was believed
that spirits could use them to ascend
upwards in the Middle Ages people began
to associate ladders with the Gallo so
to walk underneath one could have been
to foreshadow your imminent death by
hanging there's also a third explanation
which is the Christian concept of
Trinity walking under a ladder disrupts
the natural Trinity associated with the
shape which I guess would somehow curse
you mirrors in the past were usually
very small and very expensive and
building a cultural taboo around
breaking them is almost sensible in the
sense that in populations were mirrors
were so rare and scarce
maybe the superstition about breaking
mirrors was about saving money because
they cost so much mirrors are no longer
so rare but yet the superstition still
remains there is this ancient belief
that projections of your physical self
contain a piece of your soul so if you
shatter a mirror
it could be believed that you shattered
a part of your soul in the process but
of course this superstition assumes that
number one souls are real number two
that they can be in multiple places at
once and number three that they could
somehow be trapped within a reflective
surface even though mirrors are flat and
have no depth whatsoever so once again
seems a little bit far-fetched when it's
raining outside people will often
mention it's unlucky to open umbrellas
if you're still in the house or indoors
one explanation for the superstition
comes from ancient Egypt where umbrellas
were used only by the elite but not so
much for rain but to shield themselves
from the Sun to open an umbrella inside
then was an insult to the Egyptian god
of the Sun raw but there's actually a
more sort of grounded explanation for
the umbrella superstition and it comes
from 18th century England this was the
first time period where umbrellas became
widely available but they were made with
very sharp metal spokes and frames which
would very rapidly expand when opened
this made it actually a potentially
dangerous and volatile action
to open an umbrella indoors in terms of
the risk that it would place other
people and objects at and maybe that's
the source of it a very common
superstition all throughout Western
culture and especially noticeable around
Halloween is the idea that black cats
are an ill omen black cat hysteria is so
bad that around Halloween many animal
shelters won't allow anybody to adopt
black cats because they fear that the
adopters will mistreat them around
Halloween medieval Europe was a place
where superstition was very plentiful
since there was very little education
available to much of the population and
this was a period during which witch
hunts were not unheard of I'm not
talking about investigating the
president for possible illegal
coordination with a foreign country I'm
talking about actual witch hunts and
relatedly the idea that black cats were
associated with the occult also started
then cats are known as nocturnal people
started to associate them with the devil
as a result and the superstition grew so
intense that people actually undertook
mass purges of black cats in Europe
let's talk about salt salt has been for
a very long time a really important food
item it's used for flavor it's used for
preservation it's been very valuable
throughout history and a common
superstition that surrounds salt is that
spilling it is an omen of misfortune and
the best way to counter this is to throw
a pinch of salt over your left shoulder
in an age where salt was rare and very
valuable it makes sense that norms would
develop around its use given its value
if you spilled some you were throwing a
lot of money away which would feel like
bad luck the other theory about this
superstitions origin actually comes from
Leonardo da Vinci and his famous
painting of the Last Supper because in
the picture we can see that Judas the
man who would go on to betray Jesus to
the Romans had spilled salt relating to
one of the most reviled men in history
with spilling salt may have helped to
spread the news that spilling salt is an
evil portent it's practically a reflex
for many when you hear someone sneeze
you hear god bless you
or some version of it for many people
it's just good manners but the origins
of the expression are very very firmly
rooted in superstition
one theory is that people used to think
that a sneeze was an attempt by the soul
to escape the body so if you bless the
person who sneezed you're protecting
their exposed soul from the devil who
might try to steal it in a moment of
opportunity there's another theory that
comes from the time when Europe was
being ravaged by plague
sneezing was thought to be one of the
first symptoms so in 590 C II Pope
Gregory the first ordered that those who
sneeze to be blessed immediately I don't
know if you have this tradition at your
house but around Thanksgiving it's a
common practice to remove the wishbone
from a turkey before you carve it once
dried two people make a wish
pull the bone from either side and
whoever has the bone break in their
direction supposedly has their wish
granted
this is a tradition believed to have
been inherited from the Romans who got
it from an Italian people they conquered
in antiquity the Etruscans who believed
that chickens were Oracle's who
predicted the future chickens would
often be sacrificed by the Romans and
the Etruscans their remains were
searched by priests for clues as to what
the future held and how this morphed
into being about turkeys and only the
wishbone isn't completely clear but what
is clear is that the power to grant the
desires of a Thanksgiving guest is
definitely not something that the
turkeys version of a clavicle bone would
accomplish next let's talk about
knocking on wood very common expression
common action to knock on wood
after potentially jinxing something the
action of knocking on wood keeps away
bad luck in pre-christian Europe people
worshipped spirits some of whom made
their homes in the trees and to pray to
these gods and often to ask for their
favor
people would lay their hands on the
trees to communicate in Christian
communities there's a belief that by
touching wood you're also somehow
touching the wood of the Cross and
therefore you're seeking the protection
of God there's one more explanation
about knocking on wood and it comes from
British folklore
Steve roud who claims that a 19th
century children's game known as tikki
touchwood is the progenitor to knocking
on wood the game functioned much like
modern tag except it was trees that were
the only safe zone superstitions are all
around us for many of us their use in
conversation comes so naturally that we
hardly even notice them these
superstitions some of which are even
considered rude not to adhere to come
from pre-modern understandings of the
world when you don't have science to
sort pattern from noise people's brains
jump to all sorts of conclusions to
explain what seems unexplainable today
we know more about the universe than
ever before we know that someone who
sneezes isn't having their soul leave
their body we know that breaking a
mirror is mostly a headache to clean up
rather than anything else and walking
under a ladder won't actually have any
effect on your life
many people take what's called a
Pascal's wager approach towards
superstition like those we've talked
about and what I mean by that is even
though it's really unlikely that
superstition would come true or be real
people choose to believe it just in case
in case that it's worth something if it
doesn't take a lot of effort economists
estimate that every Friday the 13th
millions of dollars are lost in business
and productivity some superstitious
Christians might refuse to pay a bill if
the total is reminiscent to the number
of the beast when we let superstitions
guide our decisions we surrender our
ability to think critically even though
we know all of these things to be true
superstitions still remain may be BF
Skinner was right and every creature who
survives by spotting patterns spots some
even when they don't exist but as the
only animal with the capacity for
intelligent thought maybe it's time we
move past the realm of superstition and
instead start to see the world for what
it is not the imaginary patterns that
superstition suggests if you're
interested in evolutionary psychology

we're continuing our conversation with
christian peachelini who's founder of
the free radicals project
host of breaking hate on msnbc
also author of the book white american
youth so in part one of the interview
christian we talked about how you got
into the neo-nazi skinhead movement and
some of the sort of characteristics of
folks that are particularly drawn to it
and targets for recruiters
before we get into how you got out of
the movement i'd be interested in
hearing a little bit about
how you see what's going on today we had
the one year anniversary recently of the
charlottesville virginia rally that led
to the death of one woman and many
injuries a rally about which
the president of the united states said
there were very fine people on both
sides including the side that included
neo-nazis and white supremacists
do you see the current resurgence
as directly connected to who's in the
white house or is it more complicated
than that
i think it's slightly more complicated
than that but i will say that
uh you know the election did
uh kick over a bucket of gasoline that
was already
that kind of ignited all the small fires
that already existed
around america um you know i i certainly
think that
uh you know we can refer to the
statements made by the white
nationalists themselves
uh from david duke to richard spencer to
matthew heimbach to
you know many of the prominent leaders
within the white nationalist movement
who came out and said
you know we've elected our man uh you
know we're excited about the policies
that
he's implementing uh you know from
building a wall to a muslim ban
to uh you know tearing uh families
uh away from each other and deporting
them
these are all these are all white
nationalist talking points and they were
thrilled
uh when trump was elected president um
you know hate crimes have been up i mean
the statistics are all there the facts
uh
you know can't be ignored and certainly
some of the policies and the words that
he's used himself can't be ignored so
uh you know i certainly think it has
fueled uh
i don't know if we'd call it a
resurgence but it's it's certainly uh
it's bigger but it's it's more that it's
come out of the shadows uh than it was
trump did not create racism my sense has
been that there's not
so so much more or new
white supremacists and neo-nazis but
there's more
comfort in just kind of saying that
those are your views
and in demonstrating publicly do you
agree or do you think that there's
actually
individuals who are entering the
movement as a result of what's going on
oh i think there are absolutely more
people entering the movement as a result
oh you do that's much worse than i was
hoping
well you know the tactics have changed
in the platforms uh
with which they they reach people have
have changed so i think the internet is
really uh it's kind of like my digital
alley right
uh you know for so many young kids you
know kids who feel marginalized rather
than going to smoke pot in an alley
like i did are now going to hang out in
chat rooms and in forums and and
you know places like 4chan and reddit
and in those places they're starting to
see these very kind of benign
uh you know white nationalist recruiting
lures
like i saw you know things about
identity politics and and uh you know
black on white crime statistics that are
falsified and
and even skepticism towards the
holocaust so it's not
you know th the new wave of this kind of
pseudo-intellectual
thinking that's influencing so many
young people both on the internet and in
real life
you know they're they're not calling
themselves holocaust deniers they're not
calling themselves white nationalists
they're skeptics
they're scientists uh they're
philosophers who are just searching for
the truth and that's the way they hide
uh you know the racism and the ideas
that they're trying to push and so many
people
david are falling victim to this and
they're not white not all of them
yeah well that's what i wanted to kind
of ask about because you mentioned the
idea of people who don't even
realize that even if they don't consider
themselves part of any of these
movements
by their mere sort of acceptance of some
of the ideas they're becoming and this
isn't an insulting term it's
a term that has a specific meaning a
useful idiot right someone who is
without being aware of it serving a
particular purpose that they're not even
necessarily connected to what are some
examples of that
well yeah no i mean i think useful idiot
is a really great way to put it it's an
intelligence term that means somebody's
been compromised without really their
knowledge
and they're being put to use without
knowing what they're doing
uh you know and i think a lot of uh you
know famous uh writers people like
jordan peterson or podcasters like sam
harris and certainly uh
you know these kind of pseudo uh
philosopher types like stefan molino
from canada uh uh you know are very good
at
hiding uh the fact and again whether
it's intentional or not i don't know
they could be useful
idiots although i would say that molino
is very uh well aware of what he's doing
and the other two may not be
they're pushing these ideas that are
gateway drugs essentially to white
nationalism when they start talking
about
skepticism of the holocaust uh or the
fact
uh you know based on the bell curve
charles murray's bell curve that
uh you know whites and asians have a
higher iq
because of genetics than than africans
and and
other people of color no christian i
know because i haven't heard one of the
people you mentioned peterson harris and
molyneux
which which ones are doing the holocaust
skepticism because that i genuinely
haven't heard from them
so stefan molyneux has several videos um
where he's talked about it where he's
you know he's freight and he's from
canada too so he has to be very specific
about what he can and can't say about
the holocaust because
uh denying it there is part of their
hate speech laws and he can be arrested
uh but you know he's he's towed the line
he's come to it and posed the question
uh you know did it you know i'm not
quoting
uh but did it happen you know he kind of
elicits people to think on it
kind of with the notion that perhaps it
didn't um
you know i can't tell you how many
parents uh i get emails from that say
you know i've lost my son or my daughter
to stefan molinel
uh you know there was a point where he
was encouraging his
his millions of followers uh to defu
their parents and dfu stands for to uh
to remove yourself from your family of
origin
yeah because he thought that that you
know parents were inherently
uh you know awful uh for the development
of children
i suspect he probably had a really bad
uh situation you know in his childhood
that
made him believe that but certainly i
would i would argue that
you know parents are not awful for
children unless the parents are awful
people
um but you know and he's always kind of
shape-shifting into this very
nationalist
uh you know very kind of white
nationalist uh viewpoint i mean even so
far as david duke praising him and
retweeting him and
and and things like that so he'll deny
it uh
until he's blue in the face but uh you
know i can tell you that for somebody
like me those aren't dog whistles those
are bull horns i hear those things loud
and clear
because i used to do the same thing i
used to mask my true intentions
and and make the words a little bit more
palatable for people to swallow
so that i could recruit them so that i
could put my ideas in their head
and essentially bait them so i could
reel them in later
and you know unfortunately i think so
many of their listeners of of molino and
harris's and
and even peterson's readers uh are
falling victim to
these ideas that are just really garbage
science and
and very racist in nature so you've
talked a lot about
how the pulling into the movement
happens
either through the sort of useful idiot
stuff
or direct recruiting as you were
directly recruited when you were 14
can you talk now a little bit about how
you get out and maybe start with you i
mean what
what started to turn for you that you
eventually got out of the neo-nazi
skinhead movement
well you know having been born with
racism not a part of my dna certainly
helped i mean
i for every day of those eight years
that i was involved i questioned
my involvement unfortunately that what i
was getting from it in terms of you know
this perception of power
and his perception of strength i started
to become really
intoxicated with with it uh and nothing
that presented itself even though it was
better was
was powerful enough to to draw me away
until
i started to actually meet the people
that i thought i hated i i'd opened a
record store in 1995
to sell white power music because that
was the world that i lived in i was in a
band and was really all i knew since i
was 14.
and uh but i also sold hip hop and punk
rock and heavy metal to make ends meet
and you know i started to meet
african-american people and jewish
people and gay people
and muslims and and all of a sudden uh
not all of a sudden but
you know over time at the store i had to
deal with these customers and i began to
realize that you know i had much more in
common with them than i did with
the people i'd surrounded myself with to
boost my own ego
and it was really the compassion that
these people showed me even though they
knew exactly who i was and what i was
about
and what i was selling in my store they
came in and chose to treat me with
compassion
uh and it was the compassion that i
received from them one
you know the people at least deserved it
from when i least deserved it i think
that was my most powerful
uh catalyst for change i just couldn't
reconcile my prejudice the demonization
that i had for these people now that i'd
met them and had
a meaningful engagement with them was
destroyed and it became
you know turned into humanization and i
just couldn't deny
um the truth anymore so
did you talk about that with the other
neo-nazi
skinhead people that you were around did
you say you know i'm starting to kind of
question
or was that was that an internal
dialogue exclusively
oh it was internal uh because you know
there was always a fear of
of seeming weak or being vulnerable
uh within the movement you know it
wasn't something that
wasn't something that most people did
you know you were talking about a bunch
of
you know type a alpha males or people
you know or males who were trying to be
that and uh you know
talking about your feelings and your
emotions wasn't always a good thing
unless it was about anger and violence
uh so i struggled with it internally
actually you know i struggled there for
the last two years i was in the movement
and i still couldn't leave
even though i was you know it was
devastating me uh
devastating me so much that i lost my
wife and my children because of it
because i didn't leave the movement fast
enough for them they were never
involved and you know the lure of this
kind of identity community and purpose
that i had found in the movement was
was too strong and i didn't have the
courage to to walk away until you know i
hit rock bottom and then
i really had no choice and when you do
that is it
a clean break is there i mean is it easy
to leave
i don't this isn't this is a poor
analogy but we've interviewed a lot of
former scientologists who say
you don't just leave right like i mean
there's physical things keeping you
there there are financial things keeping
you there
etc can you just say i'm out and that's
it
yeah i wish it were that easy but it's
not uh you know everything that i had
was invested in that movement uh you
know much like the story of the
scientologist and really you know
becoming a neo-nazi or becoming a part
of a white supremacist movement is
really not that different than a cult
or the islamic state or gang uh
or a sports team or a religious group i
mean
it was the same type of draw it was that
you know sense of belonging in the sense
of
this is who i am and this is what i'm
supposed to do with my life
um so it was very difficult uh to walk
away from that because it was really
everything that i had ever known and i
had nothing to go back to
and the threat of you know leaving
certainly the physical violence was
always there but also the threat of
not being accepted by uh you know
everybody else once you left was
was always a big threat you know like
drug users maybe it's sometimes just
easier to go back uh and for many people
that's what happens unfortunately if we
don't replace it with a new
identity community and purpose and
frankly my struggle
getting out which i you know i had to uh
i
had to question myself for many years i
had to do a lot of soul searching i had
to make amends
and seek forgiveness uh when i
eventually found the courage to tell
my story uh was a long process and it's
precisely the reason why i
i founded uh the original organization
uh
life after hate and also now free
radicals project was to actually help
people
go through that that transition and then
it kind of morphed into
proactively uh you know inserting
ourselves to try and get people to
disengage
last thing i want to touch on in the
time we have left um there's sort of
i guess to use an analogy there's retail
and wholesale strategies for getting
people
out of the movement so daryl davis for
example who we've interviewed several
times who's awesome
he has more of like a retail approach
where he will go and
individually hang out with kkk members
and other
neo-nazis etc the southern poverty law
center
has what they consider to be more of
like a wholesale approach where they are
trying to dismantle the groups from the
top
down given all options do you have
strong feelings about
what the most effective way is to
disrupt
or take apart these groups
well i think uh both strategies are
important i think we do need to
you know have a wholesale or a
preventative strategy
but we also have to to you know treat
the illness
uh patient by patient it's almost like
polio right
you know we have to treat sick people
which is what daryl and i do
to a large degree but we also have to
inoculate the population from getting
sick which is in large part what
groups like the splc or the
anti-defamation league or many of these
other
uh groups that are countering hate do
and i kind of do a little bit of both so
my goal is really to
educate people um you know through
different mechanisms like my talks the
tv show breaking hate
uh to be able to show people what they
can do uh because i know that you know
people like me and daryl
are are far in few between um
but that we also can uh that we can
destroy
this type of interpersonal racism now
i'm not talking about systemic or
institutional because that's a whole
other thing that we need to tackle as
well if we want to see racism
go away but as far as interpersonal
racism
you know this is something everybody can
do so long as we can
start to understand that ideology is not
what is radicalizing people
the pre-radicalization happens from the
day we're born
and it continues through every situation
that we have
until that extremist group presents
itself at which point we're radicalized
uh so my pre-radicalization was fraught
with abandonment and and with low
self-esteem
and confidence issues for some people
it's sexual abuse or
uh you know mental illness things like
that that
is though all those points of
marginalization trauma
those pain points that kind of just
nudges from our path that is the
radicalization process
the ideology when it presents itself is
just the permission slip
and the license to be angry uh and for
and for some people
we have been covering the hit that
tourism in the United States has taken
under Donald Trump and I was thinking to
myself if world tourism were down and US
tourism were also down it might have
nothing to do with Donald Trump right we
can't say if tourism is down everywhere
among the United States or including the
United States that it's because of
Donald Trump but we now have a new
report showing that actually worldwide
in the developed world there has been a
boom in travel and yet the United States
and one other country turkey in what's
considered the developed world have seen
a decrease in travel and it's becoming
increasingly clear that many elements of
Donald Trump being president of the
United States are really hurting the
hospitality industry big time partially
because people are saying if Trump's
president I don't want to go to the
United States the US Travel Association
has confirmed that not only has travel
been down under Donald Trump to the
United States they project that in 2018
it's going to end up down even more and
when you look at the numbers in terms of
percentages they're not obviously huge
US tourism was twelve point nine percent
of world tourism when Trump took over
the presidency it was down to 12% last
year it's down to 11 point 7 percent in
2018 but what you have to consider is
given the size of this pie of worldwide
tourism or tourism to develop nations
0.5% represents a massive amount of
money and a huge number of tourism
dollars and a significant number of
tourism and hospitality hospitality
related jobs and what every indication
points to are a few different factors
number one the travel ban itself is
keeping some people out of the country
right like some people can't come to the
United States because of the travel ban
the existence of the travel ban is
making more people choose not to come to
the United States Trump's policy on
climate change is keeping people in some
parts of the world out of the United
States Trump's attacks on other
countries including some of our allies
are keeping other people from traveling
to the United States and meanwhile this
is not a worldwide phenomenon
tourism is up in the entire developed
world again except
the United States and in Turkey Spain
Australia Canada on and on and on
significant increases in tourism and at
the bottom the United States down six
percent overall and Turkey
down six point seven percent overall
Turkey partially is because a number of
countries have travel warnings about the
safety of going to that country so when
you look at that and you say here's the
list of developed countries for the
purposes of this study Turkey has
significant security issues that
countries are warning people about
against traveling there you see that it
is indeed Donald Trump that is a
disaster for the American tourism
industry and this is an example of
something that takes a while to fix if
Trump left office tomorrow you don't
immediately get tourism back we've seen
graduate students decrease applications
to come to graduate school in the United
States these are processes planning a
trip sometimes months ahead of time
applying to and moving to another
country to go to school these things
take a while and it's going to be a
while even after Donald Trump leaves
office for this dude reverse course and
I don't think they would even care right
Republicans by and large wouldn't care
because if you're visiting the US from a
foreign country chances are you going to
the cities right maybe you're going to
New York City or maybe you go into like
Hawaii which is another blue area so
that doesn't that's not their voter base
they wouldn't care so much maybe they
say we don't really want people from
other countries coming here I mean
Sweden and Norway would be fine of
course but we don't necessarily want
these individuals in the country they
could overstay visas they might be the
same types of people that were trying to
deport on a regular basis and even
though this is bad for our economy it's
sort of is the logical conclusion for
this insular anti-immigrant xenophobic
jingoistic agenda that we've been
covering on the behalf of the Trump
administration for nearly two years now
and if the idea was stop people from
wanting to come to the United States at
least when it comes to people coming for
tourism it actually seems to be working
although I don't know whether that's
actually what the Republicans in
Congress in the Senate and in the Oval
Office intended let's talk about Alex
Jones the Alex Jones free speech hate
speech conspiracy theorist Fiasco has
just exploded because YouTube has banned
Alex Jones altogether
they've ended his channel's existence on
YouTube if you go to the Alex Jones
YouTube channel right now you will
merely see a message saying quote this
account has been terminated for
violating YouTube's Community Guidelines
Spotify as I told you had pulled some
podcast episodes Facebook had removed
some video content by Alex Jones I told
you yesterday that iTunes removed the
audio podcasts altogether and now the
big boy one of the massive moneymakers
for Alex Jones has ended his channel
altogether on YouTube and this story has
just grown and grown over the last 24
hours
and I want to do the censorship piece
justice so I want to get into more
detail about this today than I did
yesterday so first of all so that we
have all the information
why did YouTube ban Alex Jones channel
YouTube's Terms prohibit hate speech and
harassment YouTube says Alex Jones was
publishing both of those things which
clips exactly is not totally clear but
there's plenty of a fodder there right
claiming the parents of Sandy Hook
school shooting victims were crisis
actors promoting Pizza Gate conspiracy
theories which led to the harassment of
the staff and management and ownership
at that comic ping-pong Pizza whatever
it's called blaming the parkland
shooting on the wrong person there's a
very long list here and that is why
YouTube says it has banned the channel
entirely Joan's reaction is that he was
the victim of a quote globalist
Deathstar intent on banning
conservatives from platforms like
YouTube and social media he says you can
help him fight that censorship by buying
more of those bogus supplements that he
sells so oh sure
never waste a good opportunity to make
some money so now let's get into the
analysis yesterday I made clear that
this isn't a free speech issue in in the
legal sense since Spotify and iTunes and
YouTube aren't the government okay
I also made clear that these websites
have Community Guidelines and they
determine if you have violated them so
what happened here is totally legal and
in the same way that I've been deme on
it
highest or head videos limited overtime
by these platforms so has Alex Jones the
other argument is okay fine David the
companies have Terms of Service and they
can make these decisions but these
companies are so big and they have so
much control over eyeballs that they're
unique in some way it's not like your
local paper saying they're no longer
gonna accept letters to the editor from
Alex Jones the idea is these companies
are so big and control such market share
that they are tastemakers that's not
even the right word I really need a
bigger word and thus they can't just say
we're gonna block Alex Jones if your
argument is that they're too big to be
bound by the or to be have the same
freedoms that normal smaller businesses
should you have maybe the problem is
that they got so big in the first place
except I don't hear conservatives trying
to prevent companies like YouTube from
getting as big as they have gotten I
mean it's a fair argument to make right
because YouTube does seem like it's
becoming a monopoly there isn't a clear
competitor to it Facebook you can say
the same thing maybe to a lesser degree
but if you want to make those a public
commodity you have to do that because
you believe in the principle not just
because you're against Alex Jones being
banned from those platforms and not
starting to talk about it
only when Alex Jones has been banned
from those platforms so that's the legal
situation now that being said I don't
like this I don't like this and I want
to explain to you why I do like the fact
that Alex Jones is disgusting vile
dangerous material is going to be less
accessible so if that's what YouTube
wants to do legally I don't have a
problem with it but I believe that the
spirit of platforms like YouTube should
be if it's not illegal then allow it
advertisers have to have the right to
say we don't want our ads showing up on
the Alex Jones channel if that's their
prerogative if that's what they want
there shouldn't be child porn allowed
there shouldn't be direct threats
against specific people that one's
actually kind of borderline because the
pizza gate stuff from Alex Jones
arguably did lead to threats against
specific people but the theme is even if
this is okay to do by YouTube
I don't think it's a good direction the
views of people like Alex Jones should
be ostracized and discredited ideally
ignored they should be so obviously
ridiculous that they have no impact as a
policy I opted on the side of allow it
if it's legal because once you start
picking and choosing it's about whether
you like the choices YouTube or Facebook
or whoever makes now this is blurry and
complex because I do think that these
platforms have a responsibility to
police content responsibly if
individuals are being targeted or
harassed if the content is criminal then
they do have a responsibility to deal
with that and they can make these
decisions but I would prefer in the
absence of illegal content for
individual pieces of content that are
offending the policy ID lines
Terms of Service to be removed rather
than entire channels in addition once
you start doing this people are going to
point out and rightly so
YouTube is filled with horrible channels
channels that have been pointed out
lately which have not been blocked or
banned including channels where parents
do horrible things to their kids a
borderline and including child abuse and
all sorts of other stuff so part of this
isn't just the content of the videos but
it's the relative impact and the PR
around them and that's where it starts
to get dicey because it became
groupthink among these different
platforms - all at the same time say
that's gonna do it for Alex Jones so
legally I don't see a problem but I
don't like this and I recognize that
just because it's happening to Alex
Jones now and not me it could happen to
me
even if I've not put up a legal content
merely because of the sort of shifting
interpretation of what the community
guidelines are yeah I really hate that
pile on effects that we see from some of
these platforms like because Spotify
takes down some of his episodes that
means that Facebook and YouTube have to
ban them even though those platforms for
the longest time expressed that they
want to keep Alex Jones's channel up out
of the principle of free speech so
that's a little bit disconcerting and I
know people are gonna write in to me Pat
and say David are you defending alex
jones or are you defending his content
no i'm not doing either i think that the
content as I said is vile depraved and
disgust
and it's anything that leads to fewer
people seeing it is a good thing in
terms of the ends the means are
something I worry about because it is
open to significant subjectivity once
you say it's not illegal content and I
do understand why YouTube did it I get
why iTunes did it this is not only a PR
liability but if Alex Jones loses a
lawsuit against the Sandy Hook family
soon which might these platforms could
be worried about legal liability for
having allowed the offending content
once again what I want to circle back to
is the analysis from yesterday stands
which is this is what it looks like when
businesses make decisions that are best
for them just because YouTube is huge
doesn't mean they have to carry it
unless of course it's determined that in
on the basis of the 1966 Supreme Court
case Evans V Newton it's a private
company that is endowed with sort of
pseudo governmental powers or as an
agency of the state because they are so
big that's not been determined here
legally speaking but in the meantime the
problem is people will start to say if
this one why not that one people have
been emailing me about steven crowder
saying David in a lot of his videos he's
sort of bullying people and harassing
people it isn't this over the line isn't
it hate and that's why it gets very
complex yeah it's the classic slippery
slope argument and maybe you could say
the same thing about us that maybe we're
next and you know we don't defame people
here in the David Pakman show and we
don't issue any threats of violence we
tend to save that for the bonus show or
that course you know it could raise some
red flags oftentimes slippery slopes
should be resisted when they don't make
sense other times you have to consider
is there actually any protection against
the slippery slope and I think that this
is a borderline case for sure we've had
a massive break in the Trump Russia
Fiasco and there is massive news to
report to you today which is that
President Donald Trump is now admitting
that yeah the purpose of his campaign
meeting with Russians that infamous day
in Trump Tower was specifically to
obtain
hurt on Hillary Clinton during the
campaign they worked with Russia
President Trump admitting this in a
coordinated way with a scheduled meeting
meant to get damaging information for
the purposes of helping Donald Trump
defeat Hillary Clinton in the 2016
presidential campaign the circle now is
almost complete and remember we go back
to where the story started there was no
Russia story there were no meetings then
the right started shifting to collusion
wouldn't actually be a crime anyway and
then in the last couple of weeks last
week I reported to you that Donald
Trump's own attorney shifted from there
was no collusion there was no
coordination to I can't find in the
criminal code where it even mentions
collusion that was rudy giuliani last
week and now for the first time we have
Donald Trump personally admitting that
this Trump Tower meeting on June 9 2016
with Russian lawyer Natalia vessel
Mnet's kaya was not about adoptions it
was to get dirt on Hillary Clinton this
is working with Russia on the
presidential campaign here is Trump's
tweet from Sunday morning which was in
response it appears to a Washington Post
article pointing out that Donald Trump
jr. might be in serious legal trouble in
this entire thing that seemed to set
Donald Trump off who said quote fake
news reporting a complete fabrication
that I am concerned about the meeting my
wonderful son Donald had in Trump Tower
this was a meeting to get information on
an opponent totally legal and done all
the time in politics and it went nowhere
I did not know about it so Trump still
denying that he knew about it pretty
clear at this point that he did talked
about that last week claiming that it's
done all the time well not with foreign
countries we've heard from Democrats and
Republicans alike that if they were
approached by a foreign country offering
something like this they wouldn't set up
a meeting they would call the FBI which
we know the Trump administration did not
do but the big news here it's important
not to lose the thread because Trump
wants to focus on it was legal and it
was done it's done all the time this is
the first admission
Donald Trump that the meeting took place
with the goal of getting damaging
information about his opponent Hillary
Clinton this is something of value from
a foreign power and then of course aside
from the meeting itself this incident
led to lies from Trump about his
involvement after the fact he dictated
the response letter to this incident and
the reporting of it by the New York
Times after initially saying that he
didn't dictate that letter and the
number two lies about the subject of the
meeting are now confirmed I'd up by
Donald Trump we were initially told it
was about adoptions which in a sense it
kind of was
so the Magnitsky Act is related to
sanctions and adoptions is sort of quid
pro quo for it's an intimated quid pro
quo that if the hillary dirt helps trump
win then the future trump administration
would look at rewarding Russia with
eased sanctions now we know because
Trump himself said it this was about
dirt on Hillary period Trump's campaign
was offered things of value by Russia
and they accepted the offer the only
step remaining to fully close the circle
would be proof of what Trump's former
personal lawyer alleged last week which
is that Trump knew about the meeting in
advance Trump still claims that he
didn't know about that we don't know if
we're eventually going to get proof of
that or not all of the circumstantial
and timing evidence suggests Trump knew
ahead of time and in addition to that
the question of whether anything came of
it the narrative so far from people who
have been caught lying multiple times
has been we had the meeting we were
promised dirt on Hillary we wanted the
dirt on Hillary but we didn't ultimately
get it that's what we were told we
didn't ultimately get the dirt on
Hillary what's going to be next you know
we got some dirt and it was patriotic
because it kept Hillary out of the White
House because Russia wanted epic make
America great again
winner Trump to win that's the only part
of the circle left to be filled
potentially hey I mean these guys Donald
Trump jr. Jared Kushner they had never
worked on a political campaign before
there was their first time and sometimes
when you dip your toe into the water of
a political campaign you accidentally
commit a few
federal offenses that well anyone what
are the legal implications this could
make the Donald Trump's admission that
the the point of this meeting was to
obtain dirt on his opponent from a
foreign country this could make the
meeting itself conspiracy with a foreign
country this could make the lies about
the meeting obstruction of justice
conspiracy and false statements to the
feds if false statements to the feds
were made and it appears that they
probably were at this point given what
Donald Trump jr. reportedly told
investigators and and in a hearing
rather he is not necessarily said that
to investigators and what Trump is now
admitting the meeting was for
potentially multiple federal crimes by
many people implied by this tweet by
Donald Trump but the big question
remains which is will anyone and
specifically Trump pay for it and the
answer if you don't go out in November
and vote is probably not and by the way
still some people emailing me saying
[Music]
the david pakman show at david
pakman.com we've had a massive break in

remains which is will anyone and
specifically Trump pay for it and the
answer if you don't go out in November
and vote is probably not and by the way
still some people emailing me saying
there's no Russia story but very few at
this point very few people still
emailing me saying there's no Russia
story lastly we always have to ask is
this a strategy or is this stupidity
Donald Trump saying this on Twitter it's
never clear it's a pot of possible
strategy to create chaos with the
contradictions it could be trying to get
out in front of the story before it
breaks in a more damaging way it could
be idiocy and ignorance it could be a
combination of all of these but what I
returned to every time is look at the
evolution there was no meeting there was
a meeting to discuss adoptions there was
a meeting to discuss dirt on Hillary but
we
get the dirt and the next logical step
if these are all lies is we did get dirt
but nothing illegal took place or we did
get dirt but we didn't ultimately need
it because Hillary's campaign was such a
disaster every single week we learn
about more lies that have been told to
us the Trump war on the media and a free
press continues and the theme is this
phrase the enemy of the people the enemy
of the people is the phrase that keeps
coming up about the press by Donald
Trump and by his cronies and Sarah
Huckabee Sanders the White House press
secretary was asked directly a number of
times during a press briefing late last
week as the weekend was kicking off is
the press the enemy of the people as far
as she is concerned and or as far as the
Trump administration is concerned she
was asked this by the press at a press
briefing and one of the ways this is
being written up is Sarah Huckabee
Sanders refuses to deny that the press
is the enemy of the American people what
you have to understand and I'm gonna
play a clip for you here is that when
she said time and again I'm here to
represent the president's views and the
president has made his views clear it's
more than a non-denial that they see the
press as the enemy of the American
people
it is the acknowledgment that they see
the press as the enemy of the American
people she refused to say no multiple
times and said the Trump Trump is
already spoken about this it's a
slightly longer clip I'm gonna play for
you because I want you to pay attention
to the dynamics of how there are
multiple opportunities for her to just
say no no big picture I or the Trump
administration whoever she's speaking
for at the time don't see the press as
the enemy of the American people she
doesn't do that she does believe and she
is restating that the Trump
administration does believe that the
press is the enemy of the American
people let's take a look Jim on Sarah's
question from NPR she
asked you about Ivanka Trump's statement
that the press is not the enemy of the
people and she asked you whether or not
the press is the enemy of the people you
read off a laundry list of your concerns
about the press and things that you feel
like are misreported but you did not say
that the press is not the enemy of the
people and I think it would be a good
thing if you were to say right here at
this briefing that the press the people
who are gathered in this room right now
right by doing their jobs every day
asking questions of officials like the
ones you brought forward earlier or not
the enemy of the people I I think we
deserve that the president has made his
position known I also think it's ironic
I'm trying to answer your question I
politely waited and I even called on you
despite the fact that you interrupted me
why calling on your colleague I said
it's ironic and which is why I
interrupted
I'm trying if you if you finish if you
would not mind letting me have a
follow-up that would be fun but it's
ironic Jim that not only you and the
media attacked the president for his
rhetoric when they frequently lower the
level of conversation in this country
repeatedly repeatedly the media resorts
to personal attacks without any content
other than to incite anger the media has
attacked me personally on a number of
occasions including your own Network
said I should be harassed as a life
sentence that I should be choked ice
officials are not welcomed in their
place of worship and personal
information is shared on the Internet
when I was hosted by the Correspondents
Association of which almost all of you
are members of you brought a comedian
out to attack my appearance and call me
a traitor to my own gender in fact as I
know and as far as I know I'm the first
press secretary in the history of the
United States that's required Secret
Service protection the media continues
to ratchet up the verbal assault against
the president and everyone in this
administration and certainly we have a
role to play but the media has a role to
play for the discourse in this country
as well if I may follow up excuse me you
did not say in the course of those were
more
that you just made that the press is not
the enemy of the people are we to take
it from what you just said we all get
put through the wringer we all get put
in the meat grinder in this town and
you're no exception and I'm sorry that
that happened to you I wish that that
had not happened but for the sake of
this this room the people who are in
this room this democracy this country
all the people around the world are
watching what you're saying Sarah and
the White House for the United States of
America the presidency should not refer
to us as the enemy of the people his own
daughter acknowledges that and all I'm
asking you to do Sarah is to acknowledge
that right now and right here I
appreciate your passion I share it
I've addressed this question I've
addressed my personal feelings I'm here
to speak on behalf of the president he's
made his comments clear so Sarah was
that a yes or no one presses the enemy
of the American people she talks about
how she hasn't liked reports about her
and satires of her but that's not the
question the question is about the role
and the perception of the media by this
administration and if you're a defender
of the Constitution if you believe in
checks and balances the answer to this
question should be and it really has to
be a completely unequivocal and
definitive no of course the press is not
the enemy of the American people
this wasn't a vague question open to
interpretation
it's Jim Acosta from CNN who asked the
question here
he was specific she still filibustered
didn't answer and in fact she's saying
yes the press is the enemy I speak for
the president she said that's what Trump
has said and that's what the position of
the administration appears to be and
bringing up satirical pieces done about
her I guess it's either to distract her
to try to get some sympathy she might be
a more sympathetic character if she
stopped telling depraved and horrific
lies to the American people day in and
day out but it continues to amaze me how
the party that claims to be against the
safe spaces and the trigger warnings is
regularly and so easily triggered and
what's dangerous and vile about this
position is that it is even worse than
what we've seen from some of the worst
Republicans I don't romanticize Bush you
know that rap but even Bush would say
directly when he had big
flicks with individual media outlets a
free press is necessary and healthy to
democracy it's such a simple thing to
say if you believe in it and they're
just not saying it because they don't
believe in it we also know that Sarah
Huckabee Sanders calling card is off you
see a Shinto yeah so she could have
walked that tightrope and done it a
little bit better right between
appeasing President Trump and also
reassuring the importance of a free
press like she could have said that most
outlets are totally fine but there are
some liberal reporters out there doing a
horrible job and named them for example
like she could have young both things
she could have played both sides there
like she normally does she decided not
to go with I don't know if calling out
specific reporters would be walking the
tightrope necessarily but the big
picture is creeping authoritarianism and
when it's all said and done either in
2020 or in 2024 I hope that Sarah
Huckabee Sanders is remembered for what
she's become which is one of the most
disgusting participants in this aberrant
administration and aberrant not on
policy but in terms of it's just
fundamental and basic disrespect for the
base tenets of the foundation of the
United States of America send me your

you except that it's total BS and what I
mean is that there was a report which if
true would be really great news which is
that the NRA the National Rifle
Association the biggest gun lobby in the
United States they are claiming to have
such deep financial trouble that they
may be unable to continue existing which
would be lovely news except it is very
clearly an attempt to garner more
support and to push back against what
they feel is an unfair case being made
against an insurance program of theirs
by the New York by New York State and
all of this information came from a
document that the NRA filed which
Rolling Stone obtained and what the NRA
is filing says is that because of a
lawsuit that is being brought against
them by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo
and New York state financial regulators
they have become victims of a black
listing campaign by the state and have
suffered tens of millions of dollars in
damages and what they claim is they
can't access basic financial services
that they need in order to operate that
they're facing quote irrecoverable loss
and irreparable farm harm they say that
they've lost insurance cover
that they need for day-to-day operations
that some of their physical offices are
at risk that their video streaming
service and magazine may have to shut
down this is all fantastic I can't
imagine better news here but I am very
clear that these claims are being
completely exaggerated since they are
being made in a filing against New York
State they say that they've been
unfairly targeted by state regulators
over what the state claims is the
illegal sale of NRA branded insurance
for gun owners the NRA was offering this
insurance called carry guard and what
carry guard would do is if you are a gun
owner and member of the NRA and you
legally fire a gun and as a result of
legally firing that gun you incur legal
expenses carry guard NRA insurance will
reimburse you for those legal expenses
lovely little program that they have
isn't it so I think that if true this
would be great news I want the NRA to
disappear they exist to increase gun
sales they exist to make people afraid
of the world so that they go out and
they buy guns and now we are learning
that they also existed during the 2016
campaign to work as a conduit between
Russia and the Trump campaign funneling
tons of foreign money to Donald Trump
but do I believe even for a second that
the NRA is on the verge of disappearing
obviously not obviously not the NRA is
very clearly exaggerating the supposedly
dire state of their financial position
they're misrepresenting their financial
situation to get donations to turn
people against the state of New York
this is a stunningly well-funded
organization and I don't believe it at
all that they are at risk yeah I too
think it's a fund raising plea
especially because Republicans are in
control of the government now and what
helps the NRA is making the case that
the government is going to take away
your guns and they especially make that
case after like a mass shooting sure
because Republicans are in charge of
everything they can't effectively
communicate that case in the same way
that gun manufacturers have been
suffering when it comes to gun sales
partially because you don't have a
Democrat in the White
house that the NRA is saying he's about
to take your guns maybe the NRA has been
suffering mildly when it comes to
membership and so on and so forth but
they've got as we learned foreign money
coming in they've got domestic money
coming in and this is all a ploy to
suggest that the New York State lawsuit
against them is unfair interference in
what the NRA does but this is a PR
campaign it's a bottom line that's what
it is the NRA is not a responsible
I have today for you maybe one of the
most brilliant pieces of political
satire and political interviewing that
I've seen Sasha Baron Cohen as we've
talked about has a new show on Showtime
it's called who is America Sacha Baron
Cohen you may know from characters such
as Ali G Borat Bruno the dictator he has
a new character who's an Israeli
anti-terrorism expert called Iran Murad
or as the Israelis might say Alan Mahad
and his Sacha Baron Cohen says during
during his his actual show and in this
interview he speaks to accused serial
child sex assault or Roy Moore who of
course lost to Doug Jones in the Alabama
special election accused by multiple
women including some very young women of
sexually assaulting them it's unclear
when this interview took place and
that's kind of relevant and the concept
is the following Colonel Allen Mahad
says to Roy Moore that they have
developed in Israel a device at piece of
technology which can detect sex
offenders and particularly pedophiles
because they secrete an enzyme called a
D DHT which is supposedly detectable by
this piece of equipment and what he does
is just as a sample he puts it over
himself and then he puts it over Roy
Moore and of course the the gag is it
beeps over Roy Moore Roy Moore doesn't
know that it's obviously just like a
metal detector it's totally standard
metal detector and it gets really really
awkward Roy Moore visibly uncomfortable
and ultimately ends the interview
earlier earlier than planned
take a look at this they have now used
this technology to identify other
abnormalities it turns out the sex
offenders and particularly pedophiles
secrete an enzyme for D DHT which is
actually detectable it is three times
the level of non perverts
so the phrase sweating like a rapist is
actually based on science
so in Israel they have developed a
machine that is used in schools and
playgrounds to detect anyone coming in
and if they detect a pedophile
the one alleged the law enforcement and
the schools within a hundred mile radius
it is very very simple to use you just
switch it on and because neither of us
or sex offenders then it make absolutely
nothing you just put it on you put it
nearby wait
it must be faulty it's malfunctioning
I'm sure it will do the same with the
other guy here ready
so is this silver jacket yes did you
lend the jacket to somebody else maybe
no I've been married for 33 so I never
had an accusation of such things I am
not accusing you I thought this is well
then if this is an instrument I did
certainly I'm not a pedophile okay no
but the machine is well I don't know
they may be Israeli technology hasn't
developed properly this is the 99.8%
world it is not saying that you are a
pedophile of course not I am simply
cutting this conversation right now
no thank you have you been nice I
support Israel I don't support this kind
of stuff thank you no it is I'm not
saying that you're a sex offender this
is just the best and we don't know when
it was filmed and that's sort of
relevant because of course Roy Moore was
accused by multiple people of child
sexual assault strictly speaking it's
not pedophilia because as far as we know
he didn't try to have sex with
prepubescent girls just girls that are
very young and not legally adults in
some states but the funniest part of all
this is that Roy Moore seemed to believe
the technology was legitimate right like
it's just a regular handheld metal
detector it clearly doesn't measure the
secretion of D DHT or any chemical which
would indicate whether somebody is a
pedophile as crazy as the entire thing
isn't as brilliant as the entire thing
is Roy Moore seem to believe that the
technology is real I actually think he
kind of passed the test though right
because if he said that oh this is
actually is not my suit coat it's
someone else I'm borrowing it yeah
then he would have failed right but I
think he found the best way out of this
open area that I think he said something
totally boneheaded which is I've been
married 33 years like that doesn't that
doesn't explain whether you do or don't
like little kids right if anything
that's a response that should raise a
red flag because it says nothing about
pedophilia right are you attracted to
prepubescent children
I've been married for 33 years it's
actually a non sequitur when you think
about I guess I'm also just comparing it
to the other Sacha Baron Cohen
interviews yeah like he got one
Republican to blurt out the n-word and
she expose himself he got other
Republicans to advocate for a
kindergardens program where this is very
for year olds have weapons yeah it's
much better no news yet about whether
Morris sending his Jewish lawyer who we
know he has because he and his wife
talked about how they have a Jewish
lawyer in order to prove that they don't
dislike Jews to sue the colonel here and
Sacha Baron Cohen of course dragging
these people beyond the limits of its
absurdity and I was thinking like how
far would he have to go where no one
like everybody gets that it's just just
a goof you know and I think it would be
disturbingly far I think it would be
crazy what he would have to do to get to
a point where nobody thinks it's a real
thing I mean there have been a few
people who have called him out
apparently he showed up to one gun store
yeah and the owner called him out for
being Borat and there's another
congressman who didn't advocate for the
program he was pushing so it doesn't
work every time if you don't like this
tell me why because I think that this is
absolutely and totally brilliant Donald
Trump has unleashed another unhinged
attack on Twitter a series of bizarre
and Confused tweets rife with the bogus
capitalization we've become accustomed
to and most importantly totally baseless
allegations the focus is Robert Muller
and Russia and the investigation I'm
going to show you the tweets it's very
clear Trump is nervous between the manna
for trial starting tomorrow Cohen ready
to give it all up to Robert Muller news
that Trump knew and approved of the
Trump Tower meeting with Russians
promising dirt on Hillary the guy is
clearly nervous and yesterday he
unleashed the following tirade about
Robert Muller I won't even mention that
there are 14 improper 13 improper
capitalizations here just just know that
they're there
there is no collusion Trump said the
Robert Muller rigged witch-hunt headed
but now by 17 increased from 13
including an Obama White House lawyer
angry Democrats was started by a
fraudulent dossier paid for by crooked
Hillary Hemu DNC therefore the
witch-hunt is an illegal scam is Robert
Muller ever going to release his
conflicts of interest with respect to
President Trump
including the fact that we had a very
nasty and contentious business
relationship I turned him down to head
the FBI one day before appointment a
special counsel and Comey is his close
friend also why is Muller only
appointing angry Dems some of whom have
worked for crooked Hillary others
including himself have worked for Obama
and why isn't Muller looking at all of
the criminal activity and real Russian
collusion on the Democrat side
Podesta dossier I'm wondering if there's
anything that's true in that rant 13
random capitalizations but beyond that
Democrats aren't running molars
investigation in fact Republican Moeller
appointed by Republican George W Bush is
running it the dossier wasn't fraudulent
it also wasn't the basis for the
investigation nothing about the probe is
illegal that's been explored
significantly in detail at this point
and the fact that Moeller was FBI
director for Obama again seems totally
irrelevant since he was appointed not
only is he a Republican he was appointed
by Republican George W Bush and what
you've got to realize is that Trump's
four tweet tirade does nothing to attack
the merit or the facts of what happened
or what Cohen knows or what Trump did
and I like how also Trump says he had a
very nasty relationship with Robert
Muller there's this story Pat that molar
angrily left Trump's golf club like ten
years ago over a dispute over golf club
fees Moeller has put out a statement or
his spokesperson has saying he just left
the club there was really no controversy
but in either case that just has nothing
to do with this seem so minor I'm moving
I'm going to a different club I don't
want to support this I'm gonna play golf
somewhere else
yeah that's why there's it there's a
so-called witch-hunt that has already
found 32 people to indict if that's the
big blockbuster that makes Muller
personally committed to it vendetta
against Trump you're gonna need to come
up with something bigger and this is all
the behavior somebody who's really
worried that the probe is not only not
ending its advancing and it's getting
closer and closer to Trump and to put a
final point on that let's go to White
House press secretary Sarah Huckabee
Sanders herself she said back in 2016
quote when you're attacking FBI agents
because you're under criminal
investigation you're losing that seems
to be the most prescient comment about
this entire thing and of course it
wasn't made about Trump at the time but
it certainly seems to apply today send
me your thoughts what do you think is
behind this absolutely unhinged Twitter
tirade that Trump Unleashed I'm on
Twitter at D Pakman the show is on
Twitter at David
Hockman show we had a big bombshell
blockbuster story over the weekend and
it relates to that infamous Trump Tower
meeting this is the meeting attended by
Donald Trump jr. and Paul manna Ford and
Jared Kushner as well as ratata Italian
I'm sorry
Russian lawyer not Italian Russian
lawyer
Natalia vessel Matz kaya a twitch dirt
on Hillary was promised it's the center
of a lot of controversy and the big news
is that Michael Cohen now claims Donald
Trump's personal former personal lawyer
now claims that he was personally there
when Donald Trump was told about the
meeting ahead of time something he
previously denied knowing about and also
said let's do it and this if true is
absolutely and totally massive Michael
Cohen is reportedly willing and ready to
say this to special prosecutor Robert
Muller under oath and it has been
specifically and widely denied by Donald
Trump by everybody around him Donald
Trump claimed that he knew nothing about
this meeting until he heard about it the
following year when the New York Times
asked him about it before they reported
on it that would obviously be untrue if
Michael Cohen's allegations are true of
course Donald Trump continues to deny
knowing about it he says Cohen is lying
to get himself out of other trouble
Donald Donald Trump among other tweets
this weekend sent one where he said
quote I did not know of the meeting with
my son Don jr.
sounds to me like someone is trying to
make up stories in order to get himself
out of an unrelated jam taxi cabs maybe
he even retained Bill and crooked
Hillary's lawyer gee I wonder if they
helped him make the choice the problem
is Trump's already been caught lying
about this meeting right so aside from
Cohen's claim that Trump knew about the
meeting and approved the meeting Donald
Trump initially said he had nothing to
do with drafting the letter that was
published in response to news of the
meeting later we found out Trump
dictated the letter so if anybody here
has a history of lying about this
particular meeting its Donald Trump not
Michael Cohen and Trump said it multiple
lawyers said it's
Huckabee Sanders Trump jr. they all said
Trump knew nothing about it and there
have already been some hints that it
isn't so clear Trump knew nothing
because even though Rudy Giuliani now is
saying it's all lies back in May Rudy
Giuliani didn't even deny it he vaguely
sort of said I would be surprised if
Trump could remember knowing about the
meeting ahead of time which is very
different than to say no Trump knew
nothing about it and then just last
month Rudy Giuliani said the following
to George Stephanopoulos about who wrote
that letter responding to the meeting
which of course was riddled with lies
Rudy Giuliani now explaining why listen
everybody just changes their stories all
the time and a lot of people look at one
of the president shifting explanations
the White House shifting explanations
for what happened in that meeting at the
Trump Tower back in June of 2016 with
Don junior I remember when this was
first reported Jay Sekulow was on my
program so the president had nothing at
all to do with that letter later Sarah
sander said well wait he he sort of
weighed in but he didn't dictate it and
now this letter from the president's
lawyers say very very clearly he
dictated the statement how do you
explain those shifting he's like what
happened to me with the whole situation
of repaying the money that was laid out
by Cohen when I first when the first
president first talked about it nobody
focused on it nobody thought about it
that was a very busy time and then when
we got on board I went through
everything the only change we had to
make at that point this other change
that we made when you consider the big
scope of this narrative four or five
complicated thing the president was
there he was dealing with a letter at
first it was all denied and now you're
saying he dictator I don't know that Jay
Jay would have to answer that and I've
talked to him about it
I think Jay was wrong I mean this is the
reason you don't let the president
testify right you know every
recollection keeps changing this is the
best everyone's recollections are
constantly changing and Rudy Giuliani
tries to excuse the fact that Trump lied
by saying listen I also have lied on
television before of course not what
he's actually implying
so Giuliani has also been vague about
exactly what Trump knew and when and
then in March remember sam nunn Berg he
said to CNN that quote he talked about
it a week before meaning
talked about the meeting a week before
it happened and then we also have Steven
Bannon who in his own book said quote
the chance that Don Jr did not walk
these jou mows up to his father's office
on the 26th floor is zero meaning that
Trump jr. clearly talked about it with
Trump senior but you have to remember
that all along it always seemed like
Trump knew about it and was lying
because two days before the meeting the
meeting was on June 9 2016 2 days before
that June 7 2016 here is Trump on video
promising upcoming dirt on Hillary in
just a few days what a coincidence the
meeting was scheduled for the 9th and on
the 7th Trump says very soon in a few
days I'm gonna have news for you about
hillary clinton of course that never
happened because they didn't actually
get the dirt at the meeting but it's yet
another piece of the story that makes it
seem like Trump did know in fact there's
nothing to suggest Trump didn't know
we've got three people saying Trump
probably knew two Trump definitely knew
two days before Trump previewed it and
even on the day of there were some
tweets sent that related to it and he
dictated the response and also this was
a very small operation right his
presidential campaign yeah he's at his
own building the place where he lives in
the place where he works and it involved
his son his son-in-law and his campaign
manager how did he not know about he
knows nothing about what's why would he
know what's going on in his own building
involving his own kids his own campaign
and the person he's running against that
has nothing really a guy he was making a
deal for a window window treatments at
the time okay so legal issues possible
legal issues first of all no one is
claiming Cohen has recordings right so
it would be Michael Cohen's word that
Trump knew about it and Cohen is willing
to say that under oath to Robert Muller
but let's imagine it could be proven or
at least like if it rises to a claim
that Trump knew in advance and there was
a room full of people who said Trump
said let's do it and you
some kind of corroboration there's a
legal source quoted by Politico which
says everybody in the room when Trump
says let's do this is indictable if one
overt act occurred after the meeting
such as actually having the meeting at
Trump Tower that is potentially
accessory to conspiracy or a conspirator
number two Barbara McQuade is a former
US attorney she says if Trump was aware
of the meaning in advance and said let's
do it that he could face criminal
exposure under a number of different
legal theories although of course that's
separate from whether you can indict a
sitting president right the answer is
probably not you would first need to
impeach not gonna happen under a
Republican House and Senate and the big
issues gonna be corroboration because
Cohen's claim alone isn't likely to make
this open-and-shut but if you've got
Cohen's testimony under oath to robert
muller and Moeller can find emails or
texts that coincide with this that
people who were also in the room may
have sent or received then you have a
different story and Cohen Plus none
Berg's testimony and some text messages
now you've got a building story and this
isn't about whether Trump knew it seems
almost blindingly obvious that he did
the question is can you prove that Trump
knew and that's more complex slowly
every lie is falling apart you'd have to
be willingly ignorant or aggressively
stupid at this point to think Trump had
no idea about the meeting but the
question is can it be proven I think so
and I think it's part of a broader
strategy right Cohen puts out there that
Trump knew about the meeting and then he
has his lawyers go on TV and have them
deny it he denies himself on Twitter and
then you release the tapes I mean that
seems like a pretty good strategy to me
well along those lines
one other thing it's not a hundred
percent clear that the leak that Cohen
is willing to say this came from Cohen
because Cohen's lawyer Lanny Davis said
oh we didn't leak this and that suggests
it was the Trump team that leaked it why
would they do it historically they do
that to get ahead of something that's
even worse and of course Paul Manafort
trial starts tomorrow Michael Cohen is
about to say who knows what there's a
lot of different problems going on so if
Cohen was about to come forward with
this it's possible the Trump team leaked
it to get ahead of it and by the way I'd
still love to see the guys tax rate
let's not forget about that now I want
to go on to the next thing related to
Rudy Giuliani because I now have video
for you so bizarre and so confusing that
it's almost beyond belief except it's
the 2018 Trump administration and
everything is believable so the first
thing I talked about on the program
today
was Rudy Giuliani Trump's actual lawyer
moving from there was no collusion to
it's great to be joined today by Peter
coffin who's the author of custom
reality and you also creator of several
youtube series such as very important
documentaries he's focused on how media
and culture are directed to serve the
interests of capital bringing accessible
analysis to as many people as will
listen and it's quite a few people
you're I very interested in your YouTube
channel which has developed quite a
following Peter what would you say is
sort of like your overarching political
philosophy that that informs the content
that you do well um two things III I
think of things some III when I read
there's a book called society a
spectacle I read that and it sort of
brought together a lot of things for me
I over the years have been very critical
of like fandom and how people follow
things things have very much changed
maybe not change but maybe more gone
into overdrive on that front and I feel
like that it's noticeable that it's
under the influence and in the benefit
of capital so I try to apply sort of a
Marxist critique to a less material at
least obviously material sector of sort
of what is going on in the world culture
society things like that and the other
thing is I am a socialist I believe in
socialist politics
I believe in collective ownership of the
means of production power to the workers
all of those type of things so I tried
to sort of hover between those things
but I also well I find that a lot of
what I do is influenced by what we often
call postmodern philosophers and things
like that as well so I guess you could
call me a mishmash of a bunch of crap so
you're like a postmodern is Marxist it
sounds like yes despite that being a
contradictory term I think that fairly
decently describes me so let's talk a
little bit about the socialism part
because we've been talking there's been
this
growing confusion which maybe you've
identified between overtures social
democrats and democratic socialism or i
guess what i sometimes call actual
socialism meaning common ownership of
the means of production do you know i
think what we'll get into some of the
specifics but to be totally clear you
you have no confusion because you said
you believe in the common ownership of
the means of production you are actual
socialists you're not a social democrat
correct i am not a social democrat i
think that a lot of people who are
saying democratic socialists are really
sort of advocating social democracy but
i don't know that that's their
underlying beliefs because i've never
talked to them obviously but yeah we do
see a lot of people who are putting
forward an agenda that is more or less
it's still capitalism but with a lot of
sort of left-leaning policies trying to
balance that out and I think that's
commendable I don't think that it's
wrong to do that I think that it's not
enough basically let's dig into that
because I recently did a story I
actually I are you familiar with the
economist Richard Wolffe yes yes so he
was my college professor when I was at
the University of Massachusetts Amherst
and I've had him on the show many many
many times and over time in following
him and others I've come to the
conclusion that I actually I really am a
social democrat like I'm not actually a
socialist I don't think that more the
long term the best sort of organization
of large societies would be total common
ownership of the means of production and
I have both sort of like a pragmatic
approach to that conclusion but also
more of a theoretical approach to that
conclusion so maybe to start with like
what would in your mind be the top
argument whether it's pragmatic or a
philosophical for actual socialism
versus social democracy I think that it
really okay so my main I think the thing
that makes it hard for me to just sign
on to social democracy is because it
leaves the door open so to speak for so
much of what we are experiencing at the
moon
sort of a neoliberal capitalism
obviously I think both you and I as a
social democrat and a socialist have a
lot to criticize there but as a social
democrat I think I'm not saying that
you're uninformed or misinformed or
anything like that I think that it's
perfectly valid to have any of your
viewpoints but I also think that there's
a certain door left open for capitalist
people who hoard wealth people who
concentrate power to remain in power and
over time as social democracy progresses
they can continue to erode things look
look at the NHS in the UK for instance
elements of it have been being
privatized at such a rate like is it so
much better than the United States
healthcare system yes and it has been
for a very long time
but over the last couple of decades
they've been doing so much in the way of
attempting to privatize certain services
of it and it's slowly undermining it and
you see the crisis going on with there's
not enough doctors there's not there's a
lot of things that are being undermined
by people by private interests people
who are lobbying people who are spending
money with politicians essentially I'm
oversimplifying a little bit but I guess
what I'm unsure of is you know what
you're describing hasn't happened in
Sweden which one could argue more
closely Alliance as an actual social
democracy I don't know that anybody
knows that the UK in total is a social
democracy although they've socialized
medicine specifically so I guess I'm
unsure about the value of pointing out
when a specific program has gone one way
or the other as sort of explaining to us
the merits or or lack thereof of a
broader socialist system if that makes
sense
mm-hmm that's I mean I think that that's
fair I don't think that I think that to
go the other way the window kind of
goals goes both ways on that because
it's worked in Sweden right does that
mean it's going to work anyway and
that's in my opinion not a great
argument on the part of a lot of people
who use it in bad faith to just dismiss
any social democrat or socialist
programs or ideas right
altogether but I mean it's worth
discussion and I I agree with you that
Sweden is certainly a better system than
say the United States and in a lot of
cases the United Kingdom at least from
my observations and I'm not going to
argue with you on that idea I just think
that I do think that it's more worth it
to have the power more evenly
distributed between the actual workers
and the actual people see it becomes a
matter of degree right because as a
Social Democrat I also think the power
should be more evenly distributed but
then it becomes a question of our how
evenly are we talking about and I think
I'll just put forward what my - the sort
of two areas that push me most strongly
to social democracy versus socialism and
see what you think number one is that if
you enforce that the means of production
must be owned in common that is an
authoritarian action to take and I don't
believe or at least I have not seen any
evidence although I'm willing to have my
mind changed that you will end up with
an egalitarian self-determining society
if you impose it in an authoritarian way
that's sort of number one right that's
like a fundamental problem I have with
with pure socialism the other one would
be and I'll give you both and then you
can choose either you know are both it
but to it to address the other one is
that when I see inequality is a problem
I don't see the solution total equality
because I don't know of any other place
in human endeavours where you actually
see that what I guess we would sometimes
call full equality of outcome what I
would like to see is what I imagine a
strong social democracy would do which
is you truncate maybe even significantly
that very high end and that very low end
and you also raise the median or the
mean but that seems much more in line
with how we see human achievement
distributed whether it's academic in
sports wherever I don't know of any
place where you would see the
distribution that socialism would impose
those are sort of like my two big
philosophical disagreements
well for number one I would say that
it's not so much I mean you could look
at it as an imposition or you can look
at it from the idea of organizing
collectively if we have people who are
unionized and who are creating
organizations and working together on
ideas is it necessarily opposing if it's
a large group of people demanding
ownership over the means of production
and not necessarily every single means
of production is owned specifically by
all but so much as the actual mechanical
ownership is the workers now that does
create I do think some serious questions
that more a narco communist type people
the the conquest of bread book sort of
answers some of them although I don't
know that I entirely agree with
everything said in in that book as well
but there's more of a less centralized
you to impose something it has to be
more centralized would we really be
talking about imposing it if we're not
talking about creating a large
organization that governs everyone I'm a
libertarian socialist I don't really
believe in this sort of vanguard take
down the government established a small
group of elites to dictate socialism
down to the masses it's sort of like a
practical thing right which is then if
you're not going to decree that it's not
government ownership right it's not
communism but if the government does
well free that you must have shared
ownership by by the workers then if
companies don't want to do it then all
of a sudden it's not actually socialist
right so like how do you actually make
it socialist well that's the interesting
question there's so many people who
disagree on so many different types of
social I you brought up Richard Wolfman
well he would tell you that there's a
large number of views on what socialism
actually is at this point
yeah and my view is that there's no
actual one correct view and to say
socialism is usually to say the
transitionary state between now and
communism a more organization based
version of what communism but but
communism is actually the state of a
stateless egalitarian society it's not
so much an actual most communist parties
yes do take power and and enforce but
that doesn't that's not the actual state
of socialism or sorry communism
communism is is the really the like the
end game of a lot of various ideologies
both anarcho and state oriented but I
would say that that's getting way ahead
of course we are yeah yes I mean I think
to bring it back a little are there
particular examples of not like I'm a
big advocate of within a particular
company saying this is going to be a
co-op right there's gonna be shared
ownership or we're gonna socialized
medicine I would argue those are
examples within mixed economies of
social democracy right is there an
example that you think we should look at
of an actual country level socialism
that that has worked well that would be
a model for what you want to see my
opinion is actually done right I think
that we've had a lot of attempts and a
lot of sort of we've had the military
coos we've had coops and communes
organized but as far as I'm concerned to
see the sort of mass level type of more
horizontal organization that I tend to
talk about I mean we're talking about
something that's a large country so no
we have nots I'm constantly talking
about it in terms of a large scale
operation so I don't know that there's
really anything that could be pointed
you could point to things like the Paris
Commune and stuff but that was
obliterated by a military operation so
yeah now you mention that again I think
that's more an example
of social democracy which is a commune
decides to organize within a mixed
economy I think that can work really
well but again I'm open to having my
mind change I've just not seen the macro
example of how it would work without
becoming like you said an authoritarian
top-down thing potentially imposed by a
military yeah and again what we end up
doing I think in sort of social
democracy or socialism debates yeah I
think we end up creating the sort of
it's a dichotomy that doesn't benefit
socialists or Social Democrats I agree
it's an argument as opposed to how do we
actually materially improve the lives of
the people now if the entire world
became a social democracy and people
wanted to keep progressing where would
it go from there would it not be more
moving towards collective ownership of
the means of production I think probably
but the reason why like you said I think
something like the Paris Commune may
trend a little bit closer to social
democracy than maybe full-blown
socialism or communism is if you think
about it if you exist within a
capitalist world it doesn't matter how
socialist internally you are you have to
interact externally as a capitalist
nation you can't avoid the fact that
worldwide we're capitalists that's just
and you know what I mean
I I do and I'm guessing you think that's
bad and I think that there may actually
be that there may actually be reasons
where if you operate more as a social
democracy internally you'll get a lot of
the benefits of socialization while
still operating in the world without
some of the downsides that we've seen
happen when countries do become sort of
authoritarian socialist well I think
that there's a certain degree of we
can't if we want to move in that
direction whether it's social democracy
or socialism we have to look at it as a
broad base of organization and I think
what will be will be more
so when we talk about organizing people
if right now today we mass and this is
obviously not possible to just do but
mass organized the entire United States
of America and the entire United States
of America said to themselves we want
social democracy then socialism wouldn't
be what happened but it would be the
will of the people which is in my
opinion a little bit more important than
ideological purity the actual
self-governance part of my beliefs like
I said I'm more of a libertarian
socialist than I am a authoritarian
socialist I think that it's more
important that the will of the people is
is heated now would that stop me from
going in and saying this is why we
should collectivise the means production
everybody no I would keep doing that but
it would be I believe in sort of just
continuing that discussion rather than
saying we aren't organizing the right
way I'd prefer social democracy to what
we live in right now yeah to put a sort
of final point on it that's that gets to
the pragmatism that I think also at
least in 2018 much more applies to what
would be considered socially democratic
policies than socialism but that's
probably a sort of different
conversation I want to make sure
everybody knows Peter doesn't just talk
about socialism he talks about call out
culture he talks about sjw's identity
politics you have a lot of great stuff
on your youtube channel I want people to
check it out Peter Kaufman is the author
of custom reality and you he has a
number of different youtube series and
you can find his channel on youtube and
also using the links in the video
description Peter really a pleasure and
I'd love to have you back thank you so
much I had a great time
it is great to be joined today by David
Faris who's an associate professor of
political science at Roosevelt
University also the author of it's time
to fight dirty how Democrats can build a
lasting majority in American politics
David it's so great to have you on and
this idea of fighting dirty is of
particular interest right now because my
audience has been very split recently in
reaction to some of the tactics that
have been adopted by anti-trump
activists I guess we would call them
this includes ruining the meals at
Mexican restaurants of different Trump
administration officials and showing up
outside of Christian Nielsen's condo and
playing audio of children crying at the
border and there's people in the
audience who say to me David we need to
take the high road because ultimately we
are going to be sort of our own judges
in the long run and we need to feel good
about the tactics that we're using we
don't want to stoop to their level and
the counter to that has been listen
you're dealing with people who are
ignoring all rules of decorum tone and
they are not going to be defeated unless
we do adopt some of these tactics so
let's start like at the broadest
possible level when we talk about
fighting dirty when you talk about it
what types of tactics are you referring
to sure I mean that's a great question
and thank for having me on the show
today I think when we talk about
fighting dirty we're not talking about
like cheating or lying we're talking
about sort of pressing the boundaries of
procedural norms and sort of pressing
the boundaries of legality and
constitutionality just as our opponents
have been doing I think over the last
twenty years so it means things like
using the full constitutional power of
the minority in Congress to hold up
legislation it means not cooperating
with with the president at all that is
not giving Democratic votes to
Republican priorities because sort of
bipartisanship makes the party in power
look good and we don't want that so I
think that in terms of this whole debate
about you know civility and you know
whether it's okay to confront people in
restaurants I would tend more towards
the the confrontational side of that
debate I think you know the best way to
enjoy a peaceful meal in DC is to not
put children in cages so
I think that our activists are well
within their rights to do things that
are very confrontational I mean I think
at the same time you don't want to do
things that are deeply alienating to
people whose votes you need so I think
the two Spurs will always be a
conversation about whether a certain
tactic is really gonna work or whether
it's not but if we believe our own
rhetoric that we're in the midst of a
crisis in the midst of an emergency I do
think that that means that we can do
certain things and and pursue certain
tactics that we might not under other
circumstances so let's pick a couple of
the things you mentioned and talk sort
of through the pragmatics of it because
I agree in principle with for example
start holding up all the legislation you
can hold up a Supreme Court nomination
if you can so on and so forth very
quickly though you get to for example
because of the way that that our House
and Senate work where Democrats are put
in a position where unless they because
something that they want is bundled in
to a bigger Republican bill or proposal
unless they go along with the Republican
bill or proposal that includes an
amendment that contains something that
the Democrats want they're simply not
getting it I hate that that's the way it
is I don't believe there's any rule that
says that that things have to be bundled
together in this way it is a deliberate
political tactic that is done but it
happened so what exactly do Democrats do
in that case well I mean I think first
of all I think that it's been very rare
for Republicans to actually be smart
about this because what they have done
is they've made the underlying
legislation that they're pushing so
repugnant that the things that they're
offering as these poison pills just
aren't enough to get Democrats to vote
for things I think the one the one time
that they really succeeded in doing this
well was with the Children's Health
Insurance Program during the standoff
over over daca and in January in
February that worked really well but
since then we have seen Republicans in
Congress sort of allowing the president
to dictate this extremely regressive
unpopular agenda to them and so even
when you know even if they put goodies
into a bill that diminishes legal
immigrations the United States it's not
going to get Democratic votes because
they just can't afford to attach
themselves so it's a legislation that
I think occasionally something will come
up that is a moral imperative for
Democrats and I think that we have seen
them willing to do this and I think that
they should do this and I'm thinking of
something like funding the wall this
mythical wall in exchange for for the
dreamers that's a that's a you know
that's a compromise Democrats offered
Republicans Republicans rejected it so I
think I'm only willing to compromise
when I think there's something really
morally imperative at stake and that
could be the dreamers that could be
something about family separations that
could be something about the ACA for 99
percent of everything else that's gonna
come before Congress I'm in favor of
obstruction I have made it pretty clear
that I'm to the left of the Democratic
Party and I think that the Democratic
Party is is but by and large to the
right of the American people in general
but that being said it is sort of the
de-facto path for progressivism right
now because of the sort of structural
impediments that exist to real third
party success and that that's not really
what we're going to talk about today but
it sort of sets up my question to you
which is is part of the problem that
Democrats just aren't to the left enough
on a lot of issues such that the
daylight between the Democrats and the
Republicans isn't big enough to really
take advantage from an activism point of
view on so many of the structural issues
campaign finance and many others that we
could talk about and I'm not someone to
be clear David that says there's no
different difference between Democrats
and Republicans I think the differences
are significant and they are numerous
but on some structural issues there
isn't that much difference and I wonder
if that holds back the ability to sort
of do the type of activism that you
suggest sure I think that this is
changing a lot I think it's changed a
lot over the last two years I still see
sort of pieces of that older Democratic
Party that was not as distinguishable
from Republicans as we might like and
I'm thinking about something like when
seventeen Democratic senators voted to
roll back the dodd-frank bill earlier
this year that was a sort of depressing
reprise of the kind of democratic
politics that I think many of us have
become frustrated with over the years
in terms of some other issues that I do
think that there's more difference
between Democrats than there was ten
years ago and if you think back to 2007
in the fight over immigration reform
there were still Democrats in the party
who voted against comprehensive
immigration reform know we can have some
problems with that legislation anyway
but the point is that ten years ago
there were a significant number of
Democrats in Congress who were unwilling
to sign on to a path to citizenship for
undocumented immigrants or or help for
the dreamers so I think that's really
changed over the last ten years to the
point where I think support to the
dreamers is like a litmus test for being
in the Democratic Party in the same way
that I think support for some form of
Medicare for All or single-payer health
insurance has become the default sort of
center of gravity in the party and
that's really really different than it
was ten years ago I think that there are
still some issues where there's a lot of
work to be done and I think that that is
in the party's relationship to big
business to corporations to drug
companies and you know that's that's
something that's gonna take a little bit
longer to shake out but I do think I'm
I'm heartened that I think that because
I think that energy which is on the side
of these progressive activists who are
doing the really hard work of running
for elections of holding people
accountable and I think in the long run
they might not win every primary but I
do think that we did that side of the
party is winning a lot of policy fact
that it was losing ten or twenty years
ago in part two of the interview we'll
talk about some of the specific areas
you think that that are good areas of
focus for activists and for Democrats
but to kind of set up that part of the
conversation we've talked about the way
in which gerrymandering in addition to
just the sort of urban-rural divide is a
structural disadvantage for Democrats
and we spoke to Bill o Goolsbee
professor bill Oglesby about that and
sort of the dynamics of that can you
talk about other than that what ways are
sort of illustrative of how Democrats
are at a structural disadvantage sure I
think the most important structural
disadvantage for Democrats is the US
Senate the Senate you know every state
has the same two senators you know
according to the Constitution whether
you have 700,000 people like my oming or
the
thirty-eight million people like
California over time the way our
politics have shaken out this is given
an enormous advantage to small rural
states like North Dakota
you know like Vermont Delaware but
they're mostly Republican right and
because this is uh namenda bull
like the Constitution says in order to
change the equal representation of the
Senate you have to have the state's
consent you're not gonna get that so
this is a structural feature of our
politics it's unchangeable and Democrats
have probably you know a significant
long-term deficit in the Senate because
there's 30 or 31 Republican leaning
states and 20 or 21 Democratic many
states so that you know in a vacuum
Republicans will hold the Senate more
often than that don't just by virtue of
the sort of the population dynamics of
this country and the way that states
were created and and the sort of the
unique problem that we have in this
country I've looked we have all of these
like really tiny states with very small
populations so that that is built into
our politics in ways that I think
Democrats have been really slow to
recognize and to address how would you
address something like that well we need
more states so because we can't do away
with the Senate we can't abolish the
Senate and we can't we can't change the
equal representation in the Senate what
we really need is to create more states
that lean democratic and there's easier
and harder ways to do this the sort of
the low-hanging fruit has statehood for
Washington DC in Puerto Rico both of
whom are significant entities that have
no representation in Congress right now
DC has had a referendum that over one
when we want to join the Union Porto
Rico is a little bit more complicated
story but I do think that another
referendum would would show that the
majority of Puerto Ricans would like to
join the United States is that as a 50
second or 51st state you know what order
you want to do it in both of those
states would send two Democratic
senators to DC and it would help sort of
alleviate the imbalance that we see
structurally in the Senate and as we
know in recent American history
if these would control all three
branches of government you basically get
nothing done that's where our
partisanship is so we need to think
about these creative solutions we could
also talk about the US Virgin Islands or
Guam or any number of territories the
u.s. holds that could vote
statehood in could join the Union as a
very small state now to the extent that
that Republicans hold the House and
Senate can they not simply prevent these
territories from obtaining statehood
even if by referendum they say we want
to do it oh yeah I mean right now this
is you know Republicans like Republicans
recognize that DC would be a massive
partisan loss for them and they probably
recognize the Puerto Rico would be too
and so they're others they not going to
act on this I think that so part of part
of the idea here is that they sort of an
elaborate fantasy where Democrats take
power over the next two cycles and we
wake up in January 2021 in charge of the
entire federal government and the
question is like what do we do at it
because we need to address the
structural barriers to progressive power
just as just as importantly as we as we
focus on you know policy differences or
you know medicare for all all these
things those are important the policy
fights are important and the policies
are important but it's also important if
we're gonna win in 2022 or 2024 to take
down some of these structural barriers
and we have to do so creatively like
within the constitutional framework
there's nothing stopping us from adding
States in part two of the interview
we're actually going to talk about some
of the other ideas that you have along
those lines we have been speaking with
David Farris who's an associate
professor of political science at
Roosevelt University the book is called
it's time to fight dirty how Democrats
can build a lasting majority in American
politics and we'll pick up the
conversation right there on tomorrow's
program we're continuing our
conversation with David Farris who's an
associate professor of political science
at Roosevelt University we've been
discussing the book it's time to fight
dirty how Democrats can build a lasting
majority in American politics so David
we spoke about some of the structural
disadvantages that affect Democrats in
the United States we talked about the
idea of adding states Washington DC was
mentioned as well as Puerto Rico and we
talked about some others what else is on
your list of tactics and approaches that
Democrats can employ that would be under
this general umbrella that you talked
about in the book of fighting dirty
sure I think the probably the most
important thing that that I write about
in the book is voting rights
but we've seen over the last 20 years in
the Republican Party is it concerted - a
unified effort to pass laws that are
legal you know that are constitutional
been upheld by the Supreme Court but
that are explicitly designed to drive
down Democratic turnout and to suppress
Democratic votes you know we're talking
about things like these cooker Cudi
cookie cutter voter ID laws that have
been passed in state after state
starting with the Bush administration
talking about things like felony
disenfranchisement laws you know the
restrictions and that many states have
placed on early voting or eliminating
days to vote early all of these are
tactics that Republicans are using
they're all legal or at least they've
been declared legal by the Supreme Court
I disagree but they're using them
because they know that it drives down
Democratic turnout and so in this case
fighting dirty it just means sort of
restoring the rights of these people who
have had their their franchise taken
away from them in the way that you can
do that we're fighting this battle on a
state-by-state level right now and we're
fighting for things like automatic voter
registration or we're challenging voter
ID laws that were we're fighting things
like the voter purges in Ohio is what
but what I read about is how all of
these problems are amenable to a
national piece of legislation passed by
a Democratic Congress and signed by a
Democratic president in that piece of
legislation because of the
Constitution's elections Clause could
eliminate voter ID laws that can
reinforce as a former or even current
felons they could declare at a national
voting holiday for federal elections and
it could demand that all states have
automatic voter registration and because
federal and state elections in most
times in places are run at the same time
the states would be forced to comply
probably for all of their elections the
end result of all of this would be
adding millions upon millions of
democratic-leaning voters to the voter
rolls be making them making it easier
for them to vote you would boost voter
turnout on Election Day and as we've
seen again and again when when our
people turnout we win and when they
don't we lose and that's why Republicans
are fighting so hard to prevent people
from voting because they fear the
electorate they fear the electorate
because their policies are radioactive
and the only way that they can stay in
power is to artificially drive down
turnout and so you know you can call it
fighting dirty talk whatever you want
but it's really imperative that
Democrats address this crisis in the
voting system in this country my
audience audience has been increasingly
asking me about vote packing a court
packing rather packing the court and
looking at an increase to the number of
Supreme Court justices of course when
the appointed additional justices would
be left-leaning rather rather than
right-leaning can you talk a little bit
about the dynamics of that and how
difficult it is to actually implement
sure I mean I think the reason that
we're talking about we're packing a
little bit right now is because of what
Republicans did in 2016 right which was
that they held a seat open the you know
President Obama had nominated Merrick
garland to fill that seat and they just
refused to do it and what they did was
they took advantage of another so
problem with our Constitution as the
Constitution does not always spell out
the obligations of the different
political actors so it says advice and
consent of the Senate but it doesn't say
whether the Senate like has to do it you
know how do they do it
hearings you know none of this none of
the ways that we used to confirm
nominees to the court who really spelled
out on the Constitution at all so
Republicans were right when they said we
don't have to do this right and it's
like okay well there's a lot of other
stuff that's not in the Constitution
either and most important thing that's
not in there is the number of justices
on the Supreme Court and so I think
probably many of your viewers are
familiar with the sort of the failure of
FDR's court packing plan in the 30s so
we you know he had a hostile Supreme
Court that was striking down important
measures of the New Deal and when he was
reelected in 1936 in - and you know we
inaugurated in 1937 he feared that the
best Supreme Court was going to strike
down the social security act just like a
signature piece of the New Deal right
and so he came up with this plan that
would have added a Justice of the
Supreme Court for everyone who was over
70 and wouldn't retire so it was like an
age-based
and that plan was defeated not because
so this is great this is this is a
really serious thing but it also
includes a really funny clip there was a
debate audience that broke out in an
uncontrollable fit of laughter when a
Republican Senate candidate tried to
claim that Donald Trump has been quote
standing up to Russia which of course he
hasn't been doing he's been doing the
opposite of that I'm gonna play the clip
for you and this is part of the sort of
Orwellian Newspeak where they have
straight-up started to say the opposite
of what is going on and this is now
leaking over to Senate candidates who
are trumpets including Republican Senate
nominee Corey Stewart who's running in
Virginia against incumbent Democratic
senator Tim Kaine and Tim Kaine of
course during the debate he talked about
Russian aggression during the 2016
election undeniable at this point he
talked about Russian aggression during
Barack Obama's presidency including the
invasion of Crimea downing an aircraft
over Ukraine here is how Corey Stewart
responded and of course laughter from
both the audience and Tim Kaine and
response it was noticeably silent when
the Russians shot down a Malaysian
airliner when President Obama was in
office he was noticeably silent when the
Russians invaded the Crimea when
President Obama was in office we have a
president who was standing up to the
Russians and now senator Kaine now we
have
now we have senator Kaine now we have
senator Kaine I actually think that a
straight-up uncontrolled fit of laughter
is a pretty damn good way to challenge
these types of nonsense claims it's
actually kind of powerful imagine if
when candidates say such ridiculous
things instead of trying to fight it
point by point when they've thrown out
10 lies in a minute and convince people
which you won't be able to do right if
the entire room simply starts laughing
hysterically at the obvious lies and
then you just move on it starts to take
on an air of this childish ignorance
from these people is so dumb and so
inaccurate that it's actually funny it
doesn't even require a response and this
is not normally my view right my view is
ad homonyms aren't arguments and you
need to take the arguments on at their
core but when the arguments are not even
based in fact and this is something that
over the weekend a number of interesting
articles were written in the context of
Holocaust denial and how Holocaust
denial should be managed on online
forums because you're fundamentally not
going to be able to actually fight it
with facts because the people who are
committed to Holocaust denial are not
going to be influenced by facts what
about just laughing and if they can say
it themselves right something like Trump
is tough on Russia without cringing or
getting red in the face how are you
going to convince them that they're just
simply wrong so maybe you do laugh off
the entire thing because it's an utterly
condescending way that could actually
show that there's a total absence of
logic and rationality laughter and
ridicule as the tactic instead of logic
and rationality and these types of
administration officials and candidates
they aren't based on logic and they're
not based on rationality so you can't
use those tools against them they care
about looking tough and acting tough and
imposing their view on others and
imposing their inaccurate views on
others so maybe just by laughing at them
you make them look silly and their ideas
hopefully go nowhere send me your
thoughts about the laughter technique
and do you think that it would be
effective not in change
their minds their minds aren't going to
be changed but in exposing the lack of
believability about the nonsense that
they're spewing to others to people in
the crowd to people who watch this stuff
on TV send me your thoughts about that
so I've said before I don't really
believe in using this type of language
as legitimate political language but but
it's sort of is the right language to
use here
Trump's been totally cooked by Vladimir
Putin and I know that Pat gets very very
upset when I use that kind of language
and he pulls me aside after the show and
we often have to have a conversation
that that embarrasses max because of how
crazy it gets but he's been totally cut
by Putin who has rejected Trump's
invitation to the White House into
Washington DC one of the things that
came out of the Helsinki summit other
than the sort of undeniable obvious
confirmation that Trump is a total
captive of Vladimir Putin's is that
Trump wants Putin at the White House
they were calling it a sort of second
summit but this time not on neutral
ground like Helsinki but rather on Putin
oh sorry
Freudian slip on Trump's turf Washington
DC in the United States and it wasn't
really clear whether this was a good
idea or a bad idea until yesterday when
Russia announced that they're gonna
reject the invitation they're rejecting
Trump's offer for a summit and it is
making Trump once again look like the
humiliated fool that he is getting
played by world leaders all over the
world and when you think about one of
Putin's top goals as meddling in the
2016 election to destabilize American
democracy and to make Russia seem like a
power player the Alpha around the world
this is the exact message that is
reinforced when Russia says Oh Trump
invited Putin to the White House
no thanks this isn't the right time and
for the time being
Russia is saying no Trump top Putin
Kremlin aide Yuri ochakov said quote
after the summit you know what kind of
atmosphere there is around its outcome I
think it would be wise to let the dust
settle and then we can discuss all these
questions in a businesslike way but not
now and this invitation was not some
random offhanded
statement from Trump just last week
Trump and White House press secretary
Sarah Huckabee Sanders said preparations
were already underway for the visit
right you don't say you're already
preparing for the visit unless you're
thinking about it as a serious thing and
now Putin says now can't be bothered
right now maybe some other time
Trump even tweeted about it last week
saying the summit with Russia was a
great success except with the real enemy
of the people the fake news media I look
forward to our second meeting so that we
can start implementing some of the many
things discussed including stopping
terrorism security for Israel nuclear
proliferation cyberattacks trade Ukraine
Middle East peace North Korea and more
there are many answers some easy and
some hard to these problems but they can
all be solved apparently not with Putin
at the White House though ouch totally
played once again right Putin is kind of
like the pickup artist
and Trump is the naive youngster who
thinks he's such a nice guy why wouldn't
I go on another date with I was thinking
that this was gonna stir up Trump's
daddy issues right I think Trump has one
of those complexes where his dad never
truly accepted him yeah so he was always
upset with himself right had to have his
dad bail him out so many times with his
business endeavors right I don't like
the same thing right if we think that
Trump is Putin working for Putin and yet
Putin won't even visit the White House
that's kind of shame him the art of the
deal this guy I mean can you think of a
worse deal maker than Trump in politics
Putin is just straight-up
toying with the guy but we got along so
well in Helsinki and now he says he
doesn't want to play in my sandbox how
many times from get humiliated by Putin
before the Trump is say enough is enough
this guy is embarrassing our country
unfortunately it's a very very high
number I don't think I don't think we're
anywhere close to the number of times
Trump needs to get humiliated by Putin
before the trumpets will say this might
not be working out as well as the so
called the renewed friendship with
Russia was supposed to be working out
the trumpets don't care they're gonna
stick with them it could have been
Russia who declined the information the
invitation it could have been Israel who
declined the invitation it could've been
a 400-pound man sitting on a bed
somewhere who listen there's nearly 200
countries out there so the fact that
Russia is not coming to Washington DC
could actually relate to Equatorial
Guinea's decision or maybe the Chilean
President made the call could be anybody
tons of countries out there as Donald
Trump often likes to say we have the
first casualty from Sacha Baron Cohen's
news show who is America Baron Cohen is
of course the actor who has developed
such characters as Ali G Borat Bruno and
in this new show that he has on Showtime
he plays a a new character he's an
Israeli firearms instructor named Iran
Murad who claims to support everything
from burka bands to training
four-year-olds to use firearms and he
has gotten some really high-profile
interviews Pat including everybody from
I don't even know where a standard
Sanders hiyo
Sarah Palin I think realized that
something wasn't right or she bailed Roy
Moore was interviewed by him and today
we have the first casualty which is
Jason Spencer Jason Spencer's a Georgia
state lawmaker he was apparently so
taken with kernel Iran Murad that he
ended up supporting a burqa ban yelling
the n-word incessantly pretending to be
an Asian tourists during which he
adopted a stereotypical Asian accent and
at one point actually dropped his pants
to quote use his buttocks to intimidate
Isis here is a piece of the video and
word warning but I think that his
buttocks is going to be blurred out for
people that are watching take a look at
this because of who you are you could be
the victim of kidnapping by Isis you
have two seconds to attract attention
how do you attract attention you start
screaming take your clothes off in
America there is one forbidden world it
is the N world now I am going to be the
terrorist you have three seconds to
attack the tension go you crazy
the N word is nuni not this world this
world is disgusting Janet
Isis are scared of being seen as Omo you
know it it mean Omo
if your buttock touch them it means they
have become a transsexual now I am going
to teach you how to use your buttocks to
intimidate Isis
show me the buttock no trousers down
okay go
good one more time
but louder with America we say in the
Mossad I mean not in the Mossad if you
want to win you show some skin ok ok
show it to me now try to touch me
I'll touch you touch you with my bags
now touch it you will drop the gun
I'll touch you you are say ok stop you
have to remind me if I touch you you
will become a homosexual
ok now try to touch me go go go
ok yes on you show me your weapon go oh
thank you homosexual you drop that gun
right now you I think the most
incredible thing is that when you watch
this clip
Spencer's behavior is so insane and so
outrageous that it's actually hard to
believe he's not an actor and that this
is all scripted it's so wack that it
seems like Spencer is working for the
show but he wasn't and he's now
resigning after this he is blaming Sasha
Baron Cohen saying that he was taking
advantage of he put out a statement
through the Atlanta journal-constitution
saying that quote in posing as an
Israeli agent Cohen pretended to offer
self-defense exercises as uncomfortable
as I was to participate I agreed to
understanding that these quote
techniques were meant to help me and
others fend off what I believed was an
inevitable attack I deeply regret the
language I used at Cohen's request as
well as my participation in the class
general if I had not been so distracted
by my fears I never would have agreed to
participate in the first place obviously
the first thing anybody does when they
believe that their family may be at risk
is you go somewhere and you start
yelling the N word out incessantly like
you're having a grand old party and he's
framed himself as just being so scared
that he was scared into participating
because of fear for his family imagine
just for a second okay here's what I was
thinking about Pat if you can get Jason
Spencer to say on camera the N word like
it's a party and fake an Asian accent
what is he willing to do behind the
scenes and what could a lobbyist get him
to do by offering him some money yeah I
mean he was totally exposed here right I
don't think I I think he does genuinely
believe these things deep down and would
say these things in private
I agree normally you wouldn't do that on
camera but he was duped here and I think
that's the genius of Sasha Baron Cohen
you're better off that Jason Spencer is
resigning now a lot of people do have a
problem with what Sasha Baron Cohen is
doing they're saying you you are
misrepresenting the person that you are
and thus the entire thing is sort of
dishonest at its base I don't know that
that's a good that could be an argument
against Sacha Baron Cohen's a format
right that how he does what he does with
Ali G Borat whoever but that's not a
defense of Jason Spencer because I don't
care what costume Sacha Baron Cohen puts
on I'm not gonna start yelling the N
word out incessantly right it just not
gonna happen I don't care what costume
or who he claims to be yeah I mean your
true colors are revealed here and some
people are failing the test others are
passing the test that's currently
Sanders for example he wasn't fooled by
it he could kind of pick up on the fact
that Sasha was playing a character and
even Sarah Palin and she as we're told
Sarah Palin identified that the person
claiming to be a so-called veteran of
the service was actually Sacha Baron
Cohen and was not a former service
member and walked out of the interview
not everybody is falling for this stuff
and we are all better off with Jason
Spencer resigning I think that there is
no question about that if you disagree
that Spencer should have to resign as a
result of this please let me know and
you can discuss it on the david pakman
show subreddit at david pakman.com slash
re d di t what's been interesting
since Trump became president is the
number of Republicans who are willing to
go out there and say I disagree with the
President on this the president is wrong
about this jeff Flake john mccain susan
collins lisa murkowski
all of those people how lindsey graham
at one point marco rubio the other day
they're all willing to come out there
and say I disagree with the President on
issue X Y or Z or he took a wrong
approach to his summit with Putin
unfortunately none of these Republicans
aside from maybe giving a short
interview talking about how bad the
President did are actually willing to
stand up for him Lindsey Graham in the
early days of this administration
happened to be one of the biggest anti
Trump voices in the US Senate and then
he started going golfing with the
president and suddenly his tune changed
I mean it was almost overnight the guy
left the Golf Course and then started
talking about how great Donald Trump was
but then a few months went by no more
golf invites so he started going after
him a little bit more same thing with
Jeff Flake right Jeff Flake super loud
anti Trump guy and yet 16 different
times at least the Jeff Flake has said I
disagree with the President on this and
we cannot stand for it he's ended up
either backing down or voting or the
specific thing or person that he said
was so awful there is no real never
Trump Republican in Washington DC they
don't actually exist
what does exist is a cabal of
Republicans who understand that some of
them have to face reelection some of
them are ending their careers and don't
want to be looked upon negatively by the
American public either way they're
trying to do two things at once and one
is to give this public face of a person
who's not going to take it a person who
doesn't stand for what Trump stands for
but then we have the very private face
because after all let's let's be
perfectly honest here most Americans
don't go and check the voting records
you might see it occasionally come up in
a campaign
add so-and-so voted for this most of it
is shrouded in you know language that
paints it one way when in fact it's
another so nobody goes back and checks
the voting records or very few people do
not enough people do that gives these
never Trump Republicans the clearance to
say one thing publicly and they do a
different thing privately and that is
what we're seeing today and it's not
just they won't protect Muller it's not
just that they voted down the
congressional legislation that would
have prevented Donald Trump from
starting this trade war it's not just
that they won't let that interpreter
from that Putin meeting last week come
and testify before Congress it's all of
it these Republicans today have been
given so many opportunities to be heroes
I mean that's what they don't even
understand these guys could have been
the ones to save the day they could have
been the ones calling for that
interpreter from the Putin meaning to
come come to Congress they could have
been the ones to save the jobs that are
being lost now from the trade wars had
they acted but they don't and it's
because they're afraid they've seen
what's happened to Jeff Flake through
Donald Trump's Twitter attacks they've
seen what has happened to John McCain
through the the same Twitter attacks and
all that is his words neither of those
men have actually been punished in any
way by Donald Trump because he can't
actually do it he just goes on Twitter
makes fun of them people in his
administration make fun of them and
that's the end of it but even the threat
of just being made fun of by the
President on Twitter is enough to make
these Republicans completely complicit
with everything that this man has done
the only way to solve this problem is to
vote them out they're not going to come
around they're not going to suddenly
realize oh wait yeah I forgot to do
everything that I said I was going to do
against you it'll never happen
none of these Republicans are ever going
to be the heroes that we need them
to be even though they've had plenty of
opportunity to do it if they wanted to
they could have done it months ago
but every single one of them failed to
do it I'm fairing cousins and for David
Pakman today we'll be right back so
let's continue our discussion we've got
the NRA we've got this 29 year old
Russian agent named Maria boo Tina who's
now been indicted for working on behalf
of Russia in the United States without
being a registered foreign agent we have
a fewer of the david pakman show who
actually was at a class with Maria boo
Tina and exchanged emails with her and
he sent them to me and I've been
reviewing them and I don't know whether
they they're really relevant for the
show I don't know if he's okay with me
showing them to you but I've been
reviewing a lot of the activity that
I am joined today by Carter Paige who is
the managing partner of Global Energy
Capital former foreign policy adviser to
then candidate now president Donald
Trump and also a central figure in the
Trump Russia investigation he's
mentioned a number of times by name and
this now infamous Christopher steel
dossier which we will we will get to
first of all thank you so much for
joining us Carter nice to speak with you
David I just one brief little correction
I was a member of the Trump campaigns
foreign policy advisory committee I was
a volunteer on that for a while I
actually never had any direct
relationship with then candidate Donald
Trump and I've never spoken with him but
certainly a you know a minor minor
clarification no doubt so I mean how did
you I guess that's a good place to start
how did you end up even as part of that
group that was offering that advice on a
volunteer basis you know I've been
involved in a lot of foreign policy
debates and projects throughout my life
I was you know I've been in fellow at
various think tanks you know spent
several years at the Center for national
policy in Washington so you know I knew
that obviously the the he was a
candidate and I believed that a lot of
things he was talking about in a foreign
policy context made a lot of sense and
so you know I knew some people that had
contacts with him so I I went ahead and
I volunteered in late 2015 early 2016 so
you were in other words you identified
aspects of his platform that appealed to
you when it comes to foreign policy and
so nobody reached out to you you you
sort of made the first step and reached
out through intermediaries to the Trump
campaign yes yep that's right
and what I've been and I was I was a I
was actually a
member of the New York delegation for
then you know while Senator McCain when
he was a candidate in 2008 so I was out
in the convention in Minnesota so you
know I knew various contacts through
that you know in terms of Republican
circles that was you know some similar
stuff which I had done and even though
it was on a volunteer basis in the sense
that that you weren't paid not everybody
who wanted to volunteer to advise on
foreign policy was welcomed right so
there were there was some reciprocity
there there was a certain point at which
the campaign said okay we're putting
together this group it's a volunteer
group but the idea that anybody who
wanted to volunteer would be part of
that group you're certainly not saying
that you were part of an established
group well you know the the term of
reciprocity is you know I think it
relates to mutual benefit right I mean I
I was just a volunteer and you know the
main benefit it was like a charity for
me right
I never very want to that eyes the Trump
Organization yeah you know not it's not
the Trump Organization you know again
there is a I apologize campaign yeah
exactly yeah interesting so let's talk
about the foreign policy elements of
trumps platform that appealed to you
that made you say this is somebody I
would want to advise on foreign policy
what was it that he was saying
particularly at that point in the
campaign that so appealed to you that it
motivated you to get in touch and say
here's where I want to volunteer you
know I think it continued to solidify
over time and I you know the one speech
I would refer you back to was I believe
it was April 27 2016 is a speech at the
Mayflower Hotel in Washington where he
kind of outlined the specifics of it and
I don't have the full document in front
of me but some of the main themes is you
know there's been a lot of disasters in
US foreign policy and the time has now
come to take a new approach try some
different different
strategies and you know he he alluded to
some of the wars that were that it
unnecessarily been created you know
particularly Iraq etc and you know some
of the relationships which had really
gone downhill significantly and let you
know one of them lips would be under
that umbrella you know well I think a
couple that he particularly highlighted
was or at least in one speech they of
meant one quote in the fairly long
speech may have mentioned was you know
major powers in the the you know p5
permanent five members of the UN
Security Council including China and
Russia and I thought you know that made
a lot of sense and your expertise is
really focused in Russia in a sense
right I mean I look back at your PhD
dissertation and a lot of the work that
you've done you lived in Russia for
three years so would you is it fair to
say that among those countries your
particular expertise and relationships
that you had bringing in were connected
to Russia or would you say one of the
other countries might be where you had
more expertise you know I would it
wasn't really relationships it's just I
think you know you you alluded to two
sides relationships and expertise yeah
yes I lived in Russia for three years
from 2004 to 2007 but you know that was
you know around a decade ago
right so I in the years since have done
a lot in the Middle East Africa Asia
across Europe a little bit in Latin
America and mostly international energy
issues related to the United States
where you know a lot of the shale
technologies and other innovations that
US entrepreneurs have been doing
particularly in the energy sector which
is my which had been my main specialty
you know can be a catalyst for
going back to your term reciprocity yeah
you know possibilities for mutual
benefit between the United States and
others so but to be clear and I want to
make sure I'm not misunderstanding when
you pointed out that there were that
there were foreign policy ideas that you
liked from Trump and you listed a number
of countries there where you have
expertise
you mentioned African countries and also
Latin America Trump didn't make
bettering relations with African
countries in Latin America a significant
part of his platform right it was really
of the ones you listed it was really
Russia where he was talking about it
well you know I think he's alluded to
you know I would encourage you to look
back at that Mayflower speech from April
2016 because it gives it a good sense of
the concepts he was really thinking
about and starting to move forward on
and I think it compares and meshes
nicely with a lot of the things he's
already done in his initial
year-and-a-half in office so I you know
I think there's a little bit of a
misunderstanding or I should say a
significant misunderstanding with you
know an overemphasis on Russia given the
conspiracy theories related to that but
don't be horrible just so our audience
understands when you say like conspiracy
theories related to Russia that's such a
term that can be used in so many
different ways what would be like an
example conspiracy theory about Russia
at least as it pertains to you maybe
since I'm only talking to you here not
you know other people well sure well
that's I'm happy to talk about it look
as as I wrote in my letter to director
then director of the FBI Comey in on
September 25th 2016 you know let's let
me see I have a copy of this yeah so as
I as I noted to him you know there was
this you know that you alluded to the
dossier the world premiere of that
dossier was
launched or shown to the public on
September 23rd 2016 you know an excerpt
from that which alluded to you know al
you know completely ludicrous
allegations that you know the DNC's
consultants had come up with that I had
I had met with the CEO of Rosneft and a
senior admission senior officer within
within the Kremlin during my July 2016
trip to to Moscow so the as I wrote as I
mentioned to then director Comey and my
first first sentence I said I wanted to
provide you with a few basic facts that
should help underscore what a complete
waste of time this witch-hunt directed
at me is right so I think you know it
really you know I don't I can only speak
for myself yeah that's all I mean you
know yeah most you know hmm
most of the people whose names have been
involved in this this ongoing saga you
know I never even spoke with or met in
my entire life well let's immediately we
can let's explore because our audience
might not have everything that that you
have in front of you or the awareness of
all of the details I mean just like as
an example when you testified before
Congress in November of 2017
you did say you met with Andre barinov
who's not the CEO of Rosneft but he is
the Head of Investor Relations right
that is accurate okay so look I mean who
who what's your favorite sports sports
figure my favorite sports figure I don't
I I have no idea I'm not sure what the
relevance is of that so you know let's
see you know who's the best who's the
top star in the Boston Celtics you know
if you meet if you have a car if you
walk by the the you know the TD Garden
the Boston Garden
sure
and you know talk to someone there I
mean to say that you are you know tap
some big conspiracy well but wait a
second call you know the owner of the
Boston Celtics etc I mean you know I
went so just to be clear you're alluding
to before I step back hold on if we can
Carter because I don't want I don't want
to get off on the wrong foot with you
I'm not alluding or implying anything
I'm just saying
five minutes ago you said it was alleged
you met with the CEO of Roth's NEFT and
that was you said it was ludicrous it
was a witch hunt etc what I'm saying is
okay you didn't meet with the CEO but
you did have it you didn't walk by on
the street you met with the head of
Investor Relations Andre Baranof true or
not true
I you know there was a big party we were
watching the Euro Cup you know I think
it was Portugal vs. Wales or something
like that
okay you know everyone is just so you
know I stopped by this party that was
organized by one of the big US
investment banks in Moscow with a ton of
people and yes I said hello to him there
okay
so you know it's completely apples and
Nords oranges that you know this crazy
conspiracy that this guy is offering you
know the CEO of this company is offering
me an 11 billion dollar bribe well but
hold on I'm not saying that right car so
I'm just trying to stick it I'd say I
mean that's okay let me tell you
something that I forget exactly who
asked me that question in that in that
testimony I you know it's been you know
17 yes yeah but you know the the the
implication which that individual asking
me to that question it may have been
congressman Schiff if not I believe one
of the other Democrats on the committee
is that you know maybe there's some
wrongdoing there or maybe there's some
shred of truth in this absolutely
ridiculous document known as the dodgy
dossier there no but so okay there's not
yeah sure fair enough so okay you did
say hello now you were asked during the
same testimony
we're sanctions or the privatization of
Rosneft brought up during that exchange
as brief as it may have been and you
said that Andrei barinov may have
briefly mentioned it so that's that is
more than just saying hello if he may be
briefly mentioned either sanctions or
privatizing Rosneft that's more than
just hello right so that I'm again it
doesn't seem is under dispute here okay
David if I asked you okay when you were
at the Boston Garden yeah you know
sitting at you know similarly watching a
game good if you were watching a game
there too
over two years ago mm-hmm I was this is
a great example I remember I did this
exact thing you're saying good ok so
when you when you were there and if I
find asking you a transcript of every
conversation you had you know and those
in that time and you're sitting there
yeah it's hard to remember and you know
all I said is I may have you know that
had briefly talked about this you know
thing that was in the news right you
know any sanctions is a driver of you
know I mean it's a significant
consideration in the in the economy of
Russia so you know I may have briefly
come up I mean that's the thing about
concerns people Carter is that we've
spent five or six minutes just on two
questions which are like did you meet
Ross Neffs Head of Investor Relations
and might sanctions have been discussed
and it's almost like you think that it
is actually a big deal because you're
saying so much as opposed to just
answering it and I think this is
sometimes in the other interviews that
you've done what I've perceived as
making people say what these seem like
simple questions why isn't he just
answering them because if it was no big
deal it doesn't seem like there needs to
be so much elaboration you know maybe I
just don't understand it no because it
because there's unfortunately David and
I you know I I haven't had a chance to
watch listened to your show but you know
I know that a lot of people there they
like to take a lot of things out of
context so I wanted to make sure
they're enough that you have the full
contact that's you know I mean just like
you can those those two those two little
topics you raised are absolutely
irrelevant particularly in comparison to
the highly relevant crimes against
American democracy that the DNC funded
through that you know million dollar
plus smear campaign which was totally
false as it relates to me when it comes
to that when it comes to attacks on
American democracy at this time speaking
only for yourself as Carter page the
individual do you believe the consensus
of the intelligence community that
Russia not only meddled in the 2016
election but meddled specifically to try
to help Donald Trump and defeat Hillary
Clinton or is that a finding that you
reject I have no evidence to support
that all I know from firsthand
experience and as we've seen through 400
pages of you know largely redacted
information that came out this weekend
you know the into u.s. intelligence
committee during that time when they
were you know working on those issues
and I was getting attacked by the DNC
mm-hmm there was a lot of government
collusion with political operatives you
know but what I know firsthand through
the evidence that I've very much you
know seeing them intimately familiar
with is that collusion between the DNC a
political operatives and the US
government their intelligence committee
the same individuals that you're asking
me to assess there was serious collusion
and they did engage in hacking but I
know that's very and I think we now have
it on the public record from Saturday
that they did engage in hacking against
myself so that you know I I don't I
don't really I'm not an expert in those
other topics David but I think what we
do know is there was definitely hacking
against me
so do you build either way and a way of
getting of the intelligence community
that Russia
to help Donald Trump you said you're not
an expert in that but what we have is
those are their findings do you have a
particular reason to disbelieve those
findings as my question I don't have
reason to disbelieve I think what I have
is you know I look back at a track
record when yeah the CIA and other US
intelligence community assets have over
the course of the history you know its
history the 71 your history of the CIA
yeah you know came up with these false
theories that let that then led to war
so most infamously with the original
dodgy dossier that's why you know when I
refer to the dodgy dossier of 2016 which
was used as a way of attacking myself
and the Trump Trump campaign but I'm not
asking is that the reason why I say that
is the 2002-2003 dodgy dossier was also
a PR campaign also from London which was
used to sell the public on a war with
Iraq and I you know all I'm saying is
I'm not willing to jump on any any
theories from the Intel community
particularly given the crimes that have
been committed against myself and other
other Trump movement supporters so you
know we'll have to see I keep an open
mind but what we consider what would you
consider as evidence to say okay Russia
did metal to help Donald Trump you know
look I mean if there's if there's strong
evidence on that you know I I just
haven't I haven't seen anything right
that any I think I think President Trump
made a made a good point in Helsinki
about the server right you know I mean I
think it's it's important that you have
to look at the servers and the fact that
there didn't even hand that over and
just used similarly DNC funded campaign
operatives to make that assessment you
know I I I know what other DNC funded
campaign operatives have done in terms
of election in turf
appearance with the misinformation
campaign but you know I don't have much
much insights about that yeah we're
speaking with Carter page we'll take a
quick break and continue with him right
after this we're continuing our
conversation with Carter page Carter I
know we have limited time so there's
just a few different things I wanted to
touch on and get your thoughts the
government claims you were an agent of a
foreign power is that a finding that you
reject accept or aren't sure in terms of
how that's being defined it's David it's
a finding that's just absolutely
hilarious when I read it I mean it's
just if you look at you know the
elements which they're using to come to
that conclusion yeah some fake news
reports I mean it's just it's just such
a it's just such a shame for you know
the the standards of law enforcement but
again I think what's nice about what
happened on Saturday is that they
started you know taking some steps
towards transparency so hopefully
hopefully as those hundred plus pages of
black lines are eventually revealed
we'll understand how that's much clearer
what I just don't understand and again
this might be my naivete and if it is I
you know I'm totally open to you
explaining it to me when you say that
that it's absurd or laughable or a joke
or whatever you were the subject of
government surveillance of an American
citizen that requires a very very high
threshold to even be allowed in our
justice system many of the people
reviewing those requests were Republican
appointees so how do how do you explain
that if there's just nothing there these
requests were approved and approved and
subsequently approved how does it happen
or am I just naive and I don't get it
well look I think you know a court is
given information right right and I
think it's you know it's it's fairly
common actually that a court is going to
use the information that's provided to
it right so there's this console
and I believe it says it directly on the
top of that application but it's ex
parte right which means you know
basically it's one one side is is
putting in this giving this information
without listening to the other side yeah
so you know I think that's exactly what
happened and I think as we've seen
through real hard evidence based on the
[Music]
the david pakman show at david
pakman.com so I told you earlier this
week that there is a tape a Trump Cohen
tape recorded by his former personal
attorney Michael Cohen who's become a
pretty significant character in this
entire Trump Russia investigation at
this point
CNN obtained the tape and we're gonna
listen to a little bit of it and what
they're going to be talking about if you
have not been following the context and
I don't blame you and in fact I envy you
if that's the situation that you're in
this is a conversation between Trump and
Michael Cohen related to Playboy model
Karen McDougal
with whom Trump had an affair allegedly
at the end you're gonna hear Trump
talking about paying cash and you're
gonna hear Michael Cohen say no no no
two important things I want to mention
about this which have been mentioned
elsewhere but not so much recently
number one the cash issue before we play
the tape Rudy Giuliani has been claiming
or had been claiming for the last few
days when there was a transcript of the
tape but not the tape itself that
referencing cash for the payment had
been attributed in the transcript to
Donald Trump when in reality it was
Michael Cohen who brought up the issue
of paying cash you will listen to the
tape and you will see that it's actually
very very clearly Donald Trump who
mentions cash and then it's Cohen who
says no no no that's number one
there's also another part of the tape
which I don't even know if we're gonna
play this may be before we actually pick
up jump into it we're Donald Trump
references Pam and that increasingly is
being considered to maybe be a reference
to Pam Bondi the beleaguered Florida
Attorney General with whom Trump has had
sketchy dealings including a very
interestingly timed campaign donation
which coincided of course just mere
coincidence with the dropping of
Florida's interest in investigating
Trump University so that was at the
beginning
the tape let's now get into the tape
sort of in the heat of it where Donald
Trump and his then personal attorney
Michael Cohen are talking about how to
handle this Karen McDougal story about
her affair with Donald Trump
we got served from the New York Times I
told you this will require a lot to
unseal the divorce papers with Ivana
we're fighting it Catholics is going to
never never never catch doesn't don't
ever be able they don't have a they
don't have a legitimate birth of a woman
that doesn't correct some in handling
yes and it's all for about two three
weeks now you have to do is delay
influence even after that it's not going
to ever be opened there's no there's no
purpose for told you about Charleston I
need to open up a company for the
transfer of all of that info regarding
our friend David you know so that I'm
gonna do that right away I've actually
come upon it all to me and I've spoken
to Alan why superb about how to set the
whole thing up with a funding yes and
it's all the stuffing all the stuff
because here you never know where that
company you never know what he's gonna
get
correct so I'm I'm all over that and I
spoke to Alan about it when it comes
time for the financing which will be
listen what my name's will have to do so
oh I got so there is zero question
whatsoever that it's Donald Trump who
says what financing we're gonna pay cash
and Michael Cohen says no no no no go so
this is all water under the bridge for
trumpets they are already convinced that
there's nothing here they are saying
that the tape is too muddled to really
understand anything
obviously we we had no problem
whatsoever understanding this tape there
are a few things here okay Trump's new
lawyer Rudy Giuliani
is saying that the content of this tape
simply doesn't matter because they never
ended up making the payment this is
evidence that a payment was discussed
not evidence that a payment was made the
biggest thing I guess I don't know what
else did the the biggest element of this
that to me
is the most notable is that yet again
Trump is caught lying and this is
someone Karen McDougal about whom rumors
of affair were dismissed by Trump is
totally fake news obviously the affair
happened obviously Trump lies about
everything he's pretending to barely
even know who Karen McDougal was clearly
bogus given that he was having a
conversation with Michael Cohen about it
where he didn't seem to need to be clued
into any of the details he seemed to
know them and if you're waiting around
for trumpets to care about the lies that
ship has sailed okay that's not going to
happen
Trump claimed to know nothing about it
denied the affair entirely and now he's
on tape talking about paying her cash
criminality here as always possible
campaign finance law violations we just
don't know yet we need to see they claim
no payment was ever made do I believe
that well I certainly don't take their
word for it because they've been lying
about this all along Cohen also on the
tape admits to opening up another one of
these shell companies that should be
notable but that's par for the course at
this point that's how these people
operate Cohen opens up shell companies
and then makes payments of hush money to
people that have had affairs with Donald
Trump it's the same story with stormy
Daniels that makes the stormy story even
more plausible since she was also paid
out of a shell company created by
Michael Cohen so that's all the same
pattern the most interesting aspect of
this is that when word broke about this
tape I immediately thought if the feds
have this tape there are probably more
tapes and there's a new report out now
which says the feds probably have at
least 12 audio recordings if not more
from Michael Cohen and I maintain that
if someone can bring cut bring Donald
Trump down it is Michael Cohen
so what's Trump's reaction predictable
reaction going on PBS Newshour I'm just
kidding obviously going on Twitter where
else is he gonna go and saying quote
what kind of a lawyer would tape a
client so sad is this a first never
heard of it before
why was the tape so abruptly terminated
cut while I was presumably saying
positive things I hear there are other
clients and many reporters that are
taped can this be so too bad of course
Trump's media Lackey Sean Hannity
all over this framing the tapes is
nothing teasing the story as mumbled a
jumbled unintelligible tapes that don't
say anything notable anyway he actually
teased the segment like last night by
saying when we come back we have
breaking news the Cohen Trump audio is
out I'll give you a hint a huge dud dud
dud
straight ahead well I think more tapes
are coming right and maybe this one was
released on purpose because it's kind of
ambiguous like you don't know for sure
if Trump is suggesting that they should
make a cash payment right and maybe the
idea behind that is to catch Trump and
his lawyers in a lie right deny that it
ever happened and then you release more
tapes clearly showing that it did yeah
the next tape you have Trump on on tape
saying Michael here is a hundred and
fifty thousand dollars in cash
it is mostly 50s with some twenties
mixed in please count it make sure it
gets to Karen McDougal who I had sex
with and then of course they would say
listen that's a very muddled audio tape
and it that could be anybody we don't
know what that means what it was
definitely doctor that's that gonna be
the new excuse it's it's a fake tape the
tape is fake and did you know it's
incredible what Baron can do with
computers these days that could have
been anybody and it's completely
fabricated we'll see what happens but I
agree with Pat I think that we will see
more tapes eventually and they're not
going to be good for Donny boy remember
more than more than a year ago at this
point almost two years I mean feels like
10 years ago
when Donald Trump gave carrier
air-conditioning company a bunch of
money to keep a factory in Indiana
instead of moving something like a
thousand workers to Mexico and then
Trump claimed I did it I heroically
fixed and improved the economy by giving
money to this one company and what I
said at the time and I know many of you
were listening to the show watching the
show at the time and you'll remember me
saying this at the time I said this
isn't policy this isn't a change in the
economic and business environment that
led carrier to say I think we should
move these jobs to Mexico because we're
going to be better off financially by
doing that when you go and you give a
handout to one company and you get them
to make the opposite decision that the
market would have dictated you're not
fixing the economy at large you're not
changing
the economy at large all you're doing is
giving a company money to stay it's
effectively a bribe and of course it
failed hugely at the time carrier almost
immediately admitted that actually over
the long term the money they got from
Trump they were gonna use to automate
that Factory anyway are those those uh
job roles they were going to ultimately
move half of those thousand jobs to
Mexico anyway and it was an absolute and
total failure it was a band-aid but it
was like a crappy old band-aid that
barely had any adhesive left to stick to
your finger and you can barely even
really call it a band-aid at this point
an off-brand band-aid it was just an
adhesive bandage it was an adhesive
bandage that was not even waterproof it
was horrible whatever analogy however
far you want to go with the analogy and
now we have the exact same thing but
it's actually worse because now Donald
Trump is handing out money to try to put
a band-aid on a problem that he created
by choice the problem of the trade war
Trump's trade war a war he can't win a
war that was optional is optional has
crushed American farmers crushed
American farmers I've been telling you
about this most of these farmers are in
red states and most of them at least
mathematically are Republicans they are
Trump voters and their Republican
elected officials are understandably
upset about what's going on so what
Donald Trump has now come up with to do
is he's put together a 12 million dollar
I'm sorry 12 billion dollar emergency
fund for the farmers and farmers are
going to start getting payments because
they're getting crushed because of
Trump's trade war does anybody
understand how stupid this is does
anybody care the so-called fiscal
conservatives how fiscally irresponsible
this is you start a trade war with the
idea that I guess in some long-term way
it's going to be good for the country
it's gonna be good for American
businesses it's gonna be good for
workers we know it's not going to be
good economists say you can't win this
there's evidence that it's not good
because we are already seeing American
farmers get completely and totally
crushed so instead of looking at undoing
the bad economic policy in the first
place
Trump makes the decision
to compound the economic disaster by
spending 12 billion dollars of your
money on aid to farmers which will of
course much like giving money to carry
our air conditioner it's not going to
fix the problems that the trade war is
creating in the first place it's you
start with bad policy and then you put
bad policy on top of that what would
help farmers is fix the tariffs so that
they can get more access to foreign
markets instead of just giving them cash
and where are the fiscal conservatives
remember that when President Obama
bailed out the auto industry it was a
loan that was going to be repaid to
taxpayers with interest and at least the
portions that were loaned out under
Obama because remember some of it came
back from the Bush administration the
portions loaned out under Obama have
been paid back and Republicans still
went nuts saying you can't choose
winners and losers Obama didn't choose
winners and losers he gave out loans to
be paid back this is actually choosing
winners and losers it's saying here are
the farmers that are losing because of
the trade policy and we're gonna throw
cash at them - at least on paper keep
them as winners disastrous embarrassing
policies yeah and while the bankers
wanted to bail out it doesn't appear
like the farmers want one themselves I
don't know I don't know that I mean
they're suffering and they've said some
of them have been interviewed and
they've said well we we know these
things can take a while but in the short
term they're getting crushed and I don't
see them turning the money away anyway
that's right but they're also some of
the hardest workers in the entire
country yeah they want to pull
themselves up by their bootstraps and
you know this is all a result of an
unforced error it's not like it's the
result of a famine or no out or
something and there's actually something
horribly brilliant about what Trump is
doing here as political strategy as
usual I have no idea if Trump is aware
of this if somebody that's working for
Trump is aware of this farmers should
punish Trump in November for ruining
their businesses and their livelihoods
they should not vote for the Republicans
that allowed Trump to do the trade war
and in 2020 they should definitely not
vote for Trump either Trump starts this
trade war and it crushes the farmers but
then he says listen I had to do it they
were ripping us off we were being
treated unfairly
but here's some money so that you'll be
okay and now those farmers need Trump
because it's much easier for whoever
replaces Trump or Democrats if they take
over for Republicans in the Senate in
the house to say we're not going to do
the 12 billion in payments any more than
it is for Trump to change trade policy
and now the very people being crushed by
Trump are being held hostage to Trump's
12 billion dollars in payments because
they need the money and there's a
particular type of evil genius here and
don't forget that this was all caused by
Republicans the Republican president
starts the trade war the
republican-controlled House and Senate
allows it to happen
remember that Trump slammed Canada for
subsidizing their dairy industry which
made American dairy less competitive
what's Trump doing now by giving money
to farmers in the US it allows them to
charge less and end up with the same
amount of money because of the 12
billion in payments it is the same type
of subsidy that Trump slammed when it
was Canada doing it we are in total
idiocracy and i want to hear from you
about this i'm on twitter at des Pakman
the show is on twitter at david pakman
show and boy do we have a good one for
you today the david pakman show at david

thank you to two great people I want to
say thanks to silver Corbin who is
today's new david pakman show member of

years for silver but well on their way
both to total and complete deification
by the David Pakman show
join them at WWJ on comm or make a
pledge of as little as one dollar a
month at patreon.com slash david pakman
show
alright the much awaited
much-anticipated
very very exciting moment of the week
for many people and also something that
some people can't stand it's time for
hatred mail we're so all right it's
wrong patriot mail written by patriots
who hate David Pakman because America
and because freedom all right it's been
a little while since we had a
straight-up anti-feminist sort of men's
rights activist esque patriot mail and
that's exactly what we've got this week
let's take a listen to it together and
see if we can make heads or tails out of
it yeah ah Pakman you're miss and rest'
feminist agenda is showing you can't
seem to accept there are differences
between men and women this ping me to
anti male agenda has hijacked the
liberal wing and it's sickening
so basically get over at you ball s
wonder David Pakman is a paid actor for
the New World Order agenda he's been
exposed David Pakman hates America
confirmed so anytime you hear my name in
reverb like that for people who aren't
reading the transcript that's when my
name is in triple parentheses which is
the calling card of the anti some
white nationalist types that's how they
identified Jewish individuals on the
internet by putting triple parentheses
in the way we're interpreting that for
hatred mail purposes is with a with a
sort of extraordinary reverb thing yeah
this is a listen number one the idea
that the david pakman show is known for
a feminist agenda this is sort of like
with the Islam thing where we
simultaneously take heat because I'm too
tough on Islam and also an apologist for
Islamic terror and the truth is that I
just call it like I see it and sometimes
I have one view on a particular
situation and sometimes another it's the
same thing with the feminist stuff right
like we did a piece long-form piece
about a gender pay gap and I pointed out
that a gender pay gap exists the 77
cents on the dollar is just flat-out
wrong it appears to be more like 91 or
so cents on the dollar and some element
of that nine cent difference certainly
would be due to discrimination against
women some part of that nine cent
difference the people who believe
there's no pay gap whatsoever said I'm a
you know feminist soy boy whatever and
I've been totally subjugated by the
feminist agenda and then the some of the
people on the feminist side said David
how dare you question that it's 77 cents
on the dollar it you're both wrong it's
just there is a pay gap some part of it
is due to discrimination against women
and it's about 91 cents on the dollar I
would think that that long-form piece
would just please everyone right no no
there's no sound like both sides win we
meet on the middle we got to the bottom
of it and the truth wins out rarely in
politics is the truth actually just in
the middle of the two extremes in this
case the idea that there's no pay gap
whatsoever and that it's 70 cents 77
cents on the dollar it happened to be
roughly in the middle and everybody was
still furious anyway this is not a myth
and restore Miss Andrus show a period
and if that's that's how you see it as
because that's what you want to see make
22 hey tree its cry by using the coupon
code hey tree at 40 when you sign up for
membership at WWJ Ann pakman.com coupon
code hey tree at 40
gets you a 40% discount and it gets 22
hey tree it's too shut its here and and
it's a big fu to the hatreds does that
number grow every week it doesn't
it is great to be joined today by Karen
Presley who spent two decades as a
celebrity recruiter for Scientology and
was a member of the Sea Org which we
have spoken about before she escaped the
church three times most recently in 1998
her memoir is escaping Scientology an
insider's true story
so Karen it's it's great to have you on
I guess to start with how did you first
get involved with Scientology because I
know you know we've spoken to many
former Scientologists some
second-generation some chose to choosing
to get involved themselves as adults
what was your scenario well my husband
at the time Peters les and I moved to LA
and around 1980 and basically we heard
about Scientology through other
musicians and artists and designers in
LA a lot of people that we met were
already Scientologists or talked about
Scientology Chick Corea
John Travolta those are just some of the
people that you know influenced us and
did it ever appeal to you as for the
actual religious beliefs or was it more
something that was a community of sorts
for you
you know honestly the attraction at
first was community because we were
brand-new to LA it's a very competitive
environment and the celebrity Center
building and the people that work there
with pretty much love bomb you and make
you feel very safe as if it was a refuge
a place of safety and also you know not
so much the religion but more the
self-help aspect of it appealed to us
that's interesting so as you became more
involved in it was there a way in which
it sort of actually felt like if you
were to know if this weren't a part of
your life that you would sort of be
materially worse off absolutely that's a
great question because it really didn't
take too long for us to get to that
mindset
the celebrity Center has particular
techniques and policies that they use
written by l ron Hubbard and all the
staff are very focused on how to
indoctrinate the new people into the
system and once you get into that and
you're not aware of the indoctrination
it's very gradual and it's very light at
first but really what's going on is you
become radicalized by Scientology and
you you fail to notice that you're
gradually and slowly replacing your
original values morals and belief with
those that are embedded into you by the
Scientologists so Cynthia its
around-the-clock procedure you know
you're you're never really allowed to be
gone other than going to work going home
to sleep but you have to be there every
day
you're noticed if you don't attend the
event so it's like everything about it
indoctrinates you into the mindset can
you give us an example of a value that
you could point to where you held it
before you started working your way up
through the ranks it's in Scientology
and how it changed like I think it would
be interesting to hear an example of
what you mean by that
several let's talk valuing a family you
know when you when you grow up with as I
did I grew up in Chicago with a huge
family of relatives cousins aunts uncles
grandparents mom and dad sisters and
brothers and it was definitely a strong
family but we had strong family values
where family was to be protected and
defended and loved and when we got into
Scientology the value that really was
compromised was that family value of it
became okay to start pushing your family
in your other friends who are not
Scientologists out of your life because
sign
takes precedence over everything and the
main thing that became important to us
was not our career not our family and
not our outside friends but Scientology
and clearing the planet and
Scientologists goals
so those things absolutely did replace
our original values and beliefs there's
this very fan we'll get to it of course
as you're when you became part of the
Sea Org but there's this very like
authoritarian nature to the structure
and I find it interesting that there's
the similarity when we talk about how
authoritarianism sort of appears in
political systems
it doesn't appear overnight it's
starting to attack some of the
institutions that are part of democracy
whether it's independent press or the
judicial system or whatever the case may
be and if on day one you were told this
is where we're eventually going to be it
would seem inconceivable because it
would be such a drastic change is it
true that in these cult-like scenarios
it's a similar dynamic where if on day
one they said listen an X number of
years here's what you're going to be
accepting you would say there's no way
that I would allow myself to be involved
in that but because it sort of creeps in
your defenses are slowly disarmed that
is a great way to describe it your
defenses are gradually slowly disarmed
because your mindset you become so
vulnerable to the policies and the
teachings of l ron Hubbard that you grow
to believe that clearing the planet
through Scientology takes precedence
over everything over sleeping over your
personal health over your relationship
with your spouse over friendships and
family like I said so but that's part of
the radicalization of Scientology and we
went through that at the celebrity
Center but during the first couple years
of being a Scientologist but it it by
the time we transit the church
headquarters which is the Internet
management base where it was like moving
from Earth to Mars in terms of heavy
indoctrination the Sea Org viewpoint
which reigned over everything that was
that took precedent over your mind it's
like you had to be the Sea Org member to
clear the planet but not only that you
had to support command intention which
is the leader David Miscavige issuing
orders that compromised with your own
sense of logic and rationality and
putting yourself at risk to achieve the
goals and to complete his orders so as
to please him and that's where the
cult-like behavior just absolutely
proves itself that this organization is
a cult rich versus church you escaped in
1990 and you escaped again in 1993 and
then you after the second escape stayed
another five years before leaving for
the final time in 1998 if I have the
dates correct
talk first about well there's so many
ways we could go I mean maybe maybe you
can briefly just tell us why the word
escape is so often used in other words
why is it just not leaving or quitting
first of all but secondly what was the
sort of catalyst for you saying the
first time I need out and then
ultimately for when you made that
decision more permanently what was it
that had changed in your perspective
about it that made you say this this
can't be for me anymore oh that's that's
a long answer but I have actually
covered that in my book in depth but
let's talk about escape your once you're
in the Sea Org particularly in a cultic
headquarter like the in base was you
can't just leave you can't say I changed
my mind sorry it's time for me to go I'm
going to go rejoin my family you cannot
do that you do not have your own
mobility or autonomy you can't leave
without permission from numerous people
you have to complete a security check or
interrogation in order to even leave the
out of the gates of the property those
are just a couple things so you can't
just say I've changed my mind I'm
leaving sorry you have to escape you you
have to take it upon yourself to break
out during when there is like in my case
I timed my first escape by when I knew
there was a very small window when there
was no security and or security was less
intense and I was able to drive out of
the gates with without being apprehended
so that's that that's what I mean by
escape some people hid in trunks of cars
some people climbed over fences and tore
up their legs on the barbed wire that
was atop the chain-link fence and
security teams raced after them on
motorcycles to capture them and bring
them back so it's truly an escape and
that is no joke
that's not a movie scene that's reality
in terms of changing my mind or what was
the catalyst that caused me to finally
break out well the first time which was
like you said 1990 I I became intolerant
of the physical abuse the sleep
deprivation being treated like I was a
slave and I just refused to put up with
it nice book with my husband about it
but he didn't agree and I wanted him to
leave with me so I had to escape without
him but I came back because I didn't
want our marriage to end like you said I
escaped a second time in 1993 came back
for the same reason stayed five more
years and when I came when I broke what
had happened is you know you pile so
many things on a shelf in your mind of
things that you're unhappy about or you
don't want to tolerate but you put them
aside because you try to quote a quote
in the words of the Sea Org make it go
right and then you try to toe the line
you need the approval of the powers that
be so you behave in such a way that
doesn't
you in trouble but the the conditions
became so intolerable to my own personal
values and conscience and my moral
compass broke I realized that I had to
get out in order to survive because I
was not going to survive if I stayed and
and that it took me five years this the
third time to get to that point where I
finally broke and that is what made me
willing to have to go through anything
just to get out are people ever
irredeemable in the eyes of Scientology
I mean certainly you know you left
initially and you were allowed back and
then you left a second time and you were
allowed back and we've talked to Lori
Hudson about this as well and how she
had to go through this process of sort
of recanting all of the things that she
did and said when when she had left is
there ever a point in Scientology where
someone is irredeemable or is there
always an opportunity to come back if
you do the right thing good question
they have a program called the
rehabilitation project force which is
basically in essence a prison camp and
they end you they tell you that you are
irredeemable you you can't be you know
you can't function along with the rest
of the ethical Sea Org members so you
get dumped into the prison camp and you
have to go through 24/7 365 days a year
until you finish some people are there
for years before they quote-unquote
complete their program but what that
program completion really is is you have
become so broken and you have become so
bottom doubt as an individual you've
taken on the mindset of the leadership
and you believe that you basically scum
unless you're a perfect Sea Org member
so you put aside your own personal again
values content and then a winning
personality of a sirak member and that
is when you're redeemable that's when
you're allowed to rejoin the group last
thing I want to touch on and we do have
pretty limited time left is
how do you recruit celebrities when you
are part of the celebrity Center like
what's the strategy our celebrities ever
targeted unless you know that they
already have an interest maybe or have
friends that are part of Scientology how
is that how does that process go well
first of all there's a policy in that
Ellen Hubbard wrote about recruiting raw
meat and it's a absolute targeted
strategy for people who are currently
celebrity Scientologists to list the
names of all the people that they know
and work with and they meet with the
president of Celebrity Center and they
strategize how they're going to get to
those people and I mean we used to plant
when I was in celebrity recruitment we
used to intentionally send people to
certain parties and Hollywood because we
knew certain people were going to be
there and we had strategies to invite
these people to lunch or go out for a
drink or whatever
it's absolutely strategized how we
recruited celebrities my husband and I
at the time were I was a designer and he
was a musician so we spoke to everybody
we knew from Jeffrey Osborne to share to
Randy Jackson to loads of Frank Stallone
loads of people and musicians in Santana
and we did get quite a few people in but
none of them actually stayed except one
and and who was who was the one that
stayed oh she was a wife of Greg Rowley
who was a musician in Santana
her name was Garnett and she stayed for
many many years but everybody else that
we got in like Frank Stallone he tried
it and left
Michael caravello from Santana trying to
in love and a lot of you have been
speaking with Karen Presley who spent
two decades as a celebrity recruiter for
Scientology her memoir is called
escaping Scientology an insider's true
story Karen thank you so much for
talking to us today thank you so much
for having me
so as many of you know because you've
emailed me about it I was on Fox News
yesterday and I had a discussion with
Kyle kolinsky of secular talk before and
I was basically talking to him about
whether we think that it's worth doing
Fox News knowing that it gets so stacked
against the left discussed knowing that
it's mostly an echo chamber of
unthinking reflexive conservative I hate
to even call it thought they're sort of
non thought because you might get
somebody who's willing to hear another
point of view or do you just say no and
Kyle's view was any opportunity to show
up and actually get your voice heard in
front of people who disagree is an
opportunity to change someone's mind and
therefore it's worth it so I decided to
do it I was invited
Leland Vitter was the host bitter I
think is his last name
I was opposite Philadelphia radio host
Don Giordano of course in an attempt to
I guess not give me the credit that
could have been given to me they called
me Boston radio host opposite Dom as
Philadelphia radio host of course
implying that I guess host local radio
in Boston and don't have a syndicated
show I think it's a swipe at new media
maybe should you they don't want to
recognize that platform they also didn't
make any mention of the online platform
that's also true the topic was the
trumped Putin summit mostly they also
said right before going on that it was
going to be a four-minute segment unless
it went really well
the idea of having two guests on for a
four-minute segment is clearly what you
do when you don't actually want to
explore ideas and depth which they don't
and they also said to me before going on
engage with each other which we know
what that means it means start arguing
with each other so my strategy going in
and I'm gonna play the clip for you is I
knew that as soon as I would try to
explain a point given that there were
four minutes allocated for an interview
with two guests they would try to
interrupt me so my goal was stick to
what I want to say if interrupted go
back to what I want to say and see what
I can do and you will immediately
realize that whenever I actually started
to make a point I would immediately be
interrupted and given some kind of
different question to answer and it was
a completely expected tactic there was
also the attempt made by the
most to take on my views sort of in
addition to this dom guy so it ended up
being not surprisingly me against the
conservative guest and the host leland
Vitter but I I expected this stuff right
I went in knowing that last thing people
pointed out that I look extraordinarily
white compared to the other two I don't
know if this is done deliberately but
I've noticed that many times the leftist
guest is poorly lit and the second I
walked into the studio where I I just
sit in a dark room to do this and join
them via satellite I immediately saw
compared to our lighting here which
makes me look sort of like a human being
it's too white I'm there I don't know if
it's deliberate or not but this is not
going to look right and not surprisingly
I didn't look orange which is a good
thing but I definitely looked like a
vampire so let's get into the first part
of this interview on Fox News and let's
talk about this with Dom Giordano David
Pakman radio host in their respective
cities Philadelphia and Boston as they
are gentlemen nice to see you Dom what's
striking is when you listen to the
president's advisers whether it be John
Huntsman national security riser Bolden
or others they are far harsher in their
rhetoric than the president what do you
make of it that's true Leland and I wish
the President were a harsher in his but
the actions of President Trump what his
administration is actually doing we put
more sanctions on Putin we've kicked out
more of the delegates from the Soviet
before from Russia so his actions have
been firm in this manner and I think
it's way overblown that he's going to
give away the store a president Trump is
not going to do that in any kind of
negotiation
I wish the rhetoric though we're more
direct toward Putin that's where I
usually am David it brings up an
interesting point it is the less problem
with President Trump among many that
they have the way he goes about foreign
policy or actually the substance of it
because his David points out our Dom
points out he's been pretty tough on
Putin much tougher than Obama in many
ways by selling youthful weapons to the
Ukrainians yeah I think that the problem
really is the easily manipulable reality
of Donald Trump and I think if we want a
sort of a preview of what we could
expect with Putin we look at what
happened with Kim
John moon where Donald Trump claimed
victory on the basis of the exact same
vague promises that we've gotten from
North Korea before tweeted on the way
back that the nuclear threat is over and
we just learned that in that vein the
president just tweeted even this morning
he said wait a second he said it's been
nine months there hasn't been a nuclear
test and there hasn't been a missile
test so there's the first interruption
and now all of a sudden it's not David
and Dom it's dom and leland against
david and i tried to just stick with it
so when they came back to me i just
continued the same point i was trying to
make and of course there were continuing
efforts made to derail why shouldn't he
get credit for that the as i was saying
just days after the supposed victory in
opening the door of new relations kim
jongwan went to a potato farm instead of
meeting with trump's secretary of state
showing that there was really nothing
there so my what i'm anticipating from
this summit with putin would be that
Donald Trump will be incredibly
impressed with Putin's sense of humor
much like he was with Kim Jong Un's he's
a great guy so on and so forth I would
be worried especially after the NATO
summit just days ago where Trump started
hinting at maybe we go this thing our
own way that plays right into what Putin
wants so I wouldn't be surprised if that
gets pushed along a little bit of a way
as well a fair critique and something to
be worried about no even I don't think
that's the case again again with Kim
jong-un he is not testing missiles again
he's not getting to that final step
where he's able to hit it that's what's
important not all the posturing do I
wish President Trump were more buttoned
up and sounded as say a John Bolton
might yes I do when it comes to Putin so
now they both latch on to this talking
point hey Kim jong-un hasn't tested a
missile in nine months Dom does it and
the host does it and eventually I just
asked them to tell me why is that
something that Trump gets credit for and
I admit I actually kind of bungled it I
I think I did not handle this part as
well I was not as articulate as I wanted
to be that's his style
you guys David I think we all like his
style you don't like his style but the
results are there there are certainly no
results to speak of yet well hold on
David is that really is that really fair
you got nine months without a nuclear
weapons test you got nine months with
a missile test there's there's a new
report that there's actually an
advancement in the nuclear research
capabilities in norther clear because I
think that there's going to be
allegations here that I am unwilling to
see progress I actually was hoping for a
real victory I've been following the
North Korea crisis for more than 10
years on my program so I was I am
committed actually I believe it's one of
the main humanitarian crises that we do
let me get a question in in reality
though president Trump was able to get a
nine-month moratorium on nuclear weapons
testing and on missile testing this from
a regime that President Obama said was
the single greatest threat to the United
States when he met with President Trump
how is that not an accomplishment in and
of itself regardless of the other issues
if all of a sudden the focus is who in
the past said that someone is AG just
answer that you've got to go back to the
drawing board that's exactly what the
entire Republican Party said about the
question just answer the question how is
no missile testing and no nuclear
weapons testing in nine months not an
accomplishment explain what Trump did to
call it an accomplishment okay knock
yourself out I yeah I die they pretend
not to know what I'm asking and I think
it was pretty clear what I was asking
but yet I should have asked that I think
in a better way like for example France
also hasn't bombed Italy for the last
nine months does Trump get credit for
that or something something along those
lines I think it was okay but still they
of course had no answer to that
I mean hindsight's 2020 yes but I think
you still illustrated the point and I
think they were both stumped there they
just wanted to make it seem as if you
were the one who was asking a crazy
question they just can't understand what
crazy things I'm saying okay and then it
just goes sort of downhill from there
here's the rest of the interview it
comes back to again it is an
accomplishment and I'll be bipartisan it
was President Bush President Clinton all
American presidents couldn't break
through and even meet with this guy and
talk with him he was approaching the
final steps to be able to hit us he is
not a there's no American
that's that's the truth he is not he is
standing damn you did that no I'd rather
city a harsher light this is an echo
chamber talking point that Trump was
able to achieve something by securing a
meeting North Korean leaders have been
desperate to get the recognition David
would have during a main residence and
it was the president was his tactics
it was the Trump tactics that got the
meeting and who knows maybe woke up Kim
jong-un to know every ality of this
versus other American presidents all
right we move on real no evidence of
that move on real quickly to the
president's interview with CBS this
morning that aired about the hacking of
emails by the Russian government take a
listen what the president said I think
the DNC should be ashamed of themselves
for allowing themselves be hacked they
had bad defenses and they were able to
be hacked but I heard they were trying
to pack the Republicans too but and this
may be wrong but they had much stronger
defenses David is it a fair critique
that for as much as the Democrats cry
and scream about Russian collusion and
or Russian intervention in the election
it was Democrats who were in charge of
the national security apparatus when it
happened the the idea here that if you
are a victim of hacking it's the fault
of the victim when you don't want to
blame that heat that party who did the
hacking is absolutely hilarious and
anybody who doesn't see the absurdity of
that on its face it's going to be very
hard to actually engage on the facts
when it comes to that and what what the
the real big news related to this is
that we now know that when Donald Trump
quote jokingly said hey if Russia wants
to hack Hillary's emails that wouldn't
be a bad thing the first attempt to do
that happen within hours of that
statement that's really the news DOM and
Leo and I would counter that we do know
from the Rosenstein report on Friday the
big news is no American citizen
committed any act of collusion or crime
and there's no evidence the Russians
were effective I don't like what the
Russians did either but they weren't
effective
and you got to knock off this witch-hunt
wait it's wait a second guys hold on
hold on a second wait wait a second a
witch-hunt that finds 32 witches already
is not exactly a witch number 2 when you
say no American citizens have been
accused of crimes Paul Manafort I think
his American I know a lot of Americans
did the crime of colluding with the
Russians he's not accused of that
collusion is not what's any witches
thank you very much we appreciate it
obviously a spirited discussion went on
a little bit longer than we thought it
would which is a good thing we'll see
you guys soon yeah so I was immediately
flooded with insane hate mail on
Facebook Twitter Email even Instagram a
few samples John wrote in saying I just
decided to take a Google search on you
and wow what a waste the usual arrogant
condescending idiot probably successful
in your target market have a nice life
Frank Roden how does this tool even have
a radio show is your studio located on
Newbury Street thank God for Howie Carr
Ron I don't know what that bottom-line I
think that's an ex that that is my type
over there Ron wrote in if you intended
to embarrass yourself on Fox News you
did Joe after eight years of vacillation
and cowardice by Obama and Clinton
incorporated your nonsensical hysteria
over your mythical Trump ski is
laughable you are just another mindless
pole smoker hiding out in the wannabe
totalitarian one-party city-state of
Boston you are yet another useless faux
liberal air thief who has never had a
real job we have a couple others Pat
wrote in not this Pat no one likes a
smug evasive liberal dumbass and lastly
Mike saw you on Fox News today how in
the hell do you keep a show you are a
brain-dead you have been following
North Korea really what does that mean
thank God for you there is lowlife trash
Democrats that follow your show you are
a joke what a clown stay in Boston great
place for you millions of us are
grateful for all the amazing work our
president has done sorry piece of
garbage Hillary did not win but thank
God for our country we have a real man
for president not a pathetic joke like
you so my question is is it worth doing
this is it worth doing this or is it
just a total waste of time that's my
question to you and I look forward to
hearing from you about it a killing
Obamacare killing Obamacare has been an
obsession
of number one Republicans when Obama was
still president remember the dozens and
dozens what was it 60 70 80 attempts 261
61 votes to repeal Obamacare in the
house and number two getting rid of
Obamacare has been a priority of Donald
Trump's since he's become President of
the United States and what has been able
to what he has been able to do to attack
Obamacare are basically two things
number one Trump's tax reform plan
remove that individual mandate from the
tax plan and that piece of it I think
you said Pat doesn't get enacted until
next year is it the actual removal of
the mandate it's not entirely sure about
that one yeah at some point that that
gets enabled and that will make it so
that you no longer pay a penalty if you
don't have individual health insurance
that is meant to financially destabilize
the system it's meant to hurt Obamacare
as a to create a pretext to then get rid
of it number two
Donald Trump's administration abruptly
suspended payments to Obamacare programs
and as I've talked to you about before
if you can't get rid of the law get rid
of the money that makes the law work and
the administration is doing indeed that
ten point four billion dollars in
payments to insurers were suspended
abruptly by the Trump administration the
insurers of course immediately said well
if we don't get this money through the
ACA arrangement we're just going to
increase premiums on customers to make
up the difference and withholding these
funds is such a disaster that the
Republican chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee Republican
congressman Kevin Brady not exactly a
moderate Republican a pretty far-right
ideologue he is now asking the Trump
administration to restart those payments
and as a reminder this guy's hugely
against Obamacare the hugely against
Obamacare and he recognizes the disaster
that this is and the House Ways and
Means Committee recognizes how much of a
disaster this is the Republicans are so
concerned about the elimination of these
payments that they are considering
legislative action to force the payments
to restart Republican president stops
the payments Republican committee leader
might pass legislation to start them
back up think about how insane this is
and by the way don't think for a second
that Republicans are doing this because
of some moral responsibility that they
feel the midterms are coming that's all
it is Democrats are already starting to
talk about the rising premiums that have
been taking place and are going to
continue with these funds suspended and
Republicans know that they will suffer
if premiums continue to explode because
of this decision by Donald Trump for all
we know as soon as the midterms are over
the Republicans will go back to trump
and say have at it you can resuspend
those payments we don't have an election
coming up
but for the bottom-dwelling Trumpets who
are supposedly fiscal conservatives they
are already saying Pat this is taxpayer
money this is good this is ten point
four billion in taxpayer money that's
not being used for Obamacare and to them
I would say you were wrong this is money
collected from insurers whose pool of
customers is on average healthier and
redistributed to the insurers who are
doing a good thing mind you insuring
less healthy people it's a
redistribution meant to not penalize
insurance companies for insuring less
healthy people it's insurance company
money it's not taxpayer money yeah so
unless the American people are just by
and large looking out for the good of
big insurance companies rapists it
really shouldn't bother them that much
there is such a heart heartwarming
sentiment for the corporate health
insurance industrial complex in this
country that it makes perfect sense that
people would have a special place in
their heart for these wait a sec what
what the hell am I talking about
most important overarching story here is
that for seven years the Republicans
slammed Obamacare they took 60 something
votes in the house to repeal it knowing
it would never happen they campaigned
and so did Trump on as soon as Trump is
in office it's out Obamacare is out and
the public is opposed to the repeal of
Obamacare every iteration proposed by
Republicans to repeal Obamacare would
have led to tens of millions or multiple
tens of millions I guess is what it
would I mean of people ending up without
health insurance and what they're doing
instead is they're taking these small
cuts that Obamacare to
further try to sabotage it or sabotage
if you are of William Shatner's
pronunciation sabotage Obamacare from
succeeding great leadership and vision
right seven years to come up with
something everything they propose is
garbage they can't get it done and now
Republicans are going to Trump and
saying please restart these payments
yeah and Republicans now own the issue
of health care right because do they
can't just gut the Affordable Care Act
and do nothing to replace it and I don't
know what they're gonna do going forward
but if this is their only strategy it's
not gonna be very good for them that's
an empirical analysis based on actual
facts and data I am not convinced that
short of exploding premiums even above
like the underlying increase in premiums
that Republican hardline voters are
actually going to say that it's
it's great to have bill scher back on
the program he's the contributing editor
to Politico magazine he is also host of
the new books in politics podcast it's
part of the new books Network and I mean
bill listen I'm not gonna sugarcoat it
I'm scared about the midterms
I saw unheralded on previously for a
long time unseen levels of enthusiasm
early in Trump's first term my feeling
anecdotally is that some of that
excitement has waned we've got a new PR
RI poll which says only 28% of young
adults are certain they're going to vote
in 2018 is my fear warranted at this
point well they're you know there's
healthy fear and there's paralyzing fear
it's good to have a healthy fear yeah
I'm not paranoid but yeah yeah you don't
get cocky you don't assume that
everything is just gonna fall into place
and it's it's preordained the Democrats
take back the house that's not useful
the evidence so far I mean there there's
a debate whether you should look at
polling more or special election
performance more mmm you know all the
special elections we've had up to now
have shown you know Democratic over
performance and Republican under
performance there's definitely more
enthusiasm on the Democratic side of the
coin and you can I think a fair
assumption would be Democrats are
obviously a highly outraged what's going
on with Trump so they're motivated to
turnout Republicans you part of Trump's
victory was premise taun Trump only
voters voters that came out for him and
if he's not on the ballot there's gonna
be an enthusiasm drop on their side
similar to what happened with Obama in
his presidency when he wasn't on the
ballot Democratic turnout was lower so I
just look there's a lot of positive
signs in that regard at least in terms
of the house that doesn't necessarily
translate to the Senate because there's
so much Democratic turf being defended
especially in states that Trump won
which makes that much more uphill for
Democrats so the likeliest scenario is
Democratic House Democratic House
Republicans said they could even go in
opposite directions Democrats gained
scenes in the house and lose seats in
the Senate so
let's take those sort of in two parts I
mean number one the enthusiasm that you
rightly identify and the anger I feel
like is waning not necessarily because
people are forgetting or don't care but
because of the hyper normalization
that's going on every week there's five
scandals new lows in lack of decorum and
geopolitical diplomacy and and norms
people are becoming desensitized to I
mean III obviously happening to me
because I talk about this stuff every
day
but even other people every new scandal
is sort of like yeah what's one more
scandal at this point and that really is
concerning to me it's something to be
aware of you don't want to become
complacent but I sighs haven't seen
evidence on the ground mean the primary
turnout in every Democratic contest has
been very high now that's not just Trump
that's also many competitive races if
you have if there's a sense that a race
is not preordained you're more likely to
show up but if you're in a district that
has always been a fait accompli for
Republicans to win and I have seven
Democrats running in that district and
so you show up to see who's the
Democrats going to be that shows
evidence of interest and we haven't seen
that kind of drop-off in the actual
primary now we're in a period right now
in July where there's a bit of a primary
low we had a bunch in you know May and
June there's not as many this month that
starts to kick up again in August and
September then you're into the general
election period so you just may be
feeling some summer doldrums are gonna
start kicking in once we get to the fall
what about the special election so I go
back and forth on this I think that you
can find data to get excited about in
the special elections and you can find
data like for example that even when in
Alabama Republicans ran a serial accused
child sexual assault or Democrats only
barely won in what yes is a very very
red red state and I'm just not totally
sure how to parse the special election
results well I would look at it a
different way when Doug Jones beat Roy
Moore people treated at the time as well
the guy
accuse sex offender a child molester so
that that doesn't give you any kind of
insight into what's gonna happen in
others racism states yeah
but then a couple months later Connor
Lam wins in western Pennsylvania where
there was no scandal involving the
Republican candidate this is also very
this was an as read an area as Alabama
but still pretty read Trump did very
well there and the candidate ran they
tried the time to really push tax cuts
as a saving grace there's only a few
months after the tax cut bill passed and
that proved not to be a saving grace
even though it's Connor Lam was critical
of it he still was able to to win that
race so I don't think we have a
situation where Democrats are winning
for fluky reasons I think there's a
general pattern of Democratic Democratic
base is being excited and Republican
bases being deflated relatively speaking
that there's tough see dire Trump
loyalists out there but Trump just
barely won with not just his diehard
support but also more marginal soft
support and those folks seem to not be
showing up for these early special
elections and we'll see what happens in
November but that's the pattern so far
in terms of what's riding on this I am
very concerned about net neutrality I'm
concerned about more Supreme Court
justice selections I think it's almost a
foregone conclusion that if Republicans
control the House and Senate after the
midterms that it doesn't matter what
Moeller finds it's just nothing
nothing's going to happen
what do you identify as the areas where
the the the most is riding on this
midterm election
well if Democrats can take the house
then you're going to stymie anymore
Trump legislation you're not gonna have
another big tax cut you're you're not
gonna build the wall but the Senate is
obviously the tougher road but without
Democrats controlling the Senate you
can't block judges so you know I agree
with you bread Cavanaugh you seem to be
implying Brookhaven is probably again
that on the court I think it's probably
correct there's no evidence that a see
Collins or Lisa Murkowski is gonna jump
ship right ah and if they don't jump
ship you're probably going to see Joe
Manchin Heidi Heitkamp John tester Joe
Donnelly Doug Jones those people are
probably gonna vote for Kavanagh knowing
this is already a done deal it's it's
kind of a free vote I'm not the person
who's deciding he's gonna be on the
court so I might look at some bipartisan
points for jumping on the bandwagon that
might make some Democrats really angry
that the Democrats instead it could be
United but what you really don't want is
for tester I can't Manchin Donnelly you
know what those guys to lose in November
because you're if you're ever gonna stop
anymore Trump judges you need those guys
in the Senate and getting a few more on
top of that so I don't think it's a I
wouldn't give high odds and ever guys
taking this in it but it's not
implausible and usually if you care
about judges you want to make sure
you're picking up seats in the Senate if
at all possible one of the criticisms
when looking at some of the races you
talked about but then also some of the
races that have different dynamics and I
hear this criticism from people who are
to the left of the Democratic Party
and also to right-wingers they write to
me and they say David what are Democrats
running on like what what is the
Democratic platform for the midterms and
my instinctual reaction is that there
doesn't necessarily have to be such a
defined
party platform because we're talking
about state-level races and the dynamics
of the those races sort of differ two
questions to you number one is there
some broader Democratic platform that is
visible across the candidates in the
2018 midterms and number two is it
actually necessary or are these really
all different races with different
dynamics well they're definitely
different races different dynamics there
is an attempt at a national platform led
by Chuck Schumer called a better deal mm
I don't think you're seeing a whole lot
I like you're seeing consensus around
candidates embracing that or even using
the language and let's face it there is
there are divides in the Democratic
Party
so some candidates we're winning
primaries are more quote unquote
establishment and doing things along the
lines of let's fix the Affordable Care
Act let's invest in infrastructure
things that are left of center but
relatively safe positions to take then
of course you have people who are more
economically populist or Bernie Kratt or
Democratic socialists like Alexander
Kaiser of Cortez the most obvious
example there's also Kerry Eastman in
Omaha in Nebraska second the Omaha area
these are folks are more Pro
single-payer some are saying abolish ice
some are talking about your more you
know widespread free College things
things like that that are not
necessarily blessed by Democratic HQ in
Washington so whatever you or I think is
the right thing to do what's the best
are the briquettes the fact is people
are gonna run differently in different
races probably because of the terrain
involved probably because of who wins
these primaries and I don't think it's
gonna be the billeting for Democrats in
November because most people are gonna
come out in opposition to incumbent
Republicans and not worry so much about
differs amongst Democrats when you get
to 2020 which is gonna start happening
as soon as the 2010 midterms are over
all this litigation is gonna is gonna
really escalate who had the better idea
in the midterms which candidates you
know if Cary Eastern wins in Nebraska
you got a strong argument that a single
player can win in Nebraska we should run
this across the board if the more
establishment up candidates are winning
in the swing areas those posts are gonna
say look a Kaiser Cortes is great in
Bronx and queens that's not what we need
in Ohio in Montana and Missouri so we
got to watch closely to see how all
these people do come November in the
meantime you're gonna get used to
differences of opinion at differences in
strategy yeah you mentioned a couple of
times there Alexandria Ocasio Cortez
from the New York 14th district who
defeated the incumbent Democrat who I
believe didn't even show up to debate
her how
or let me put a different way what can
we draw more generally from the results
of that primary and what does that
primary not tell us about the broader
direction of Democrats in 2018 I think
what you can draw from it is that there
is a vibrant democratic socialist
faction that has made significant
inroads into the Democratic Party okay
now stop right there before you we got
to clarify this because this has been a
point of such confusion when you say
Democratic Socialist do you mean
socialist in terms of socializing the
means of production or do you mean
social democracy in the mode of Sweden
because even they seem confused about
what they mean by it yeah I don't know
if I can even despite that I think
there's a debate going on within
socialist circles what the definition of
socialism means okay which is which has
been going on you for a century yeah
it's kicking up anew so much drived
Democratic Socialist whatever it is they
mean by it that's all I can say about it
I'm excusing their language and there is
a democratic solutions of America they
are endorsing candidates a handful those
candidates are winning places yeah
that's a hell of a lot better than they
were doing you know one year or two
years ago right so you have to
acknowledge like you know you know
they're here and there and they're
kicking up some dust you can't say just
because our Kaiser Court has won a low
turnout primary in a very very blue
district that Democratic socialists are
taking over the entirety of the
Democratic Party that this is a winning
message in swing area it does it just
has something to say about that yes it's
the same day that she won in upstate New
York in a more conservative district
Antonio Delgado won his primary he's a
corporate attorney and he did not run on
a Bernie clap burning crab platform and
he beat people who were in Maryland six
rural suburban district David trone
who's a multi-millionaire wine mogul he
beats someone running on a single-payer
platform and you go back to other races
the famous Texas seven where the
d-triple-c you know with nuclear on
Laura Moser dropping Oppo research are
during the primary people went ballistic
how dare the Democrats do this obviously
gonna backfire against them she made the
runoff then she got trounced in the in
the runoff against another corporate
attorney
I mean she's not running as a right
winger she's running left-of-center but
she wasn't running a populist campaign
this is an upscale Houston suburb my
only point is is that different kinds of
people are winning in different
districts yeah and like I said you know
it's not just orchids because in deep
blue Bronx and queens you have care
Eastman and suburban Omaha so I'm not
saying the left isn't winning any other
places but it's in primaries so we need
to see how well these folks do in the
general or Kaiser Court is winning where
she wanted to tell anything about who's
gonna win in a swing area in the general
you and I have spoken before about what
may not be winning issues for Democrats
and you've even gone so far as to
sometimes talk about like losing issues
for Democrats a couple I want to sort of
just run by you are number one
debt and deficit at this point
particularly because it's not Trump that
they are running against at least not
directly
I spoke to Mitt Romney's opponent
earlier this week and she's talking a
lot about debt and deficit and I just am
unsure that that that's a really a
winning issue at this point in this
particular climate for Democrats number
two after the sort of activism from the
Florida parkland students around guns
has started to sort of fade you're not
hearing that much nationally about guns
although it is playing a role at sort of
the more local level can you comment on
debt and guns and then if you think that
there are issues Democrats it should
stay away from right now you know damn
deficit are always very tempting for
Democrats to pursue when Republicans are
in power because Republicans are often
hypocrites they can play about epidemics
and when Democrats are in charge they
get in power and they weren't up the
deficit so it's very tempting to say
look at those folks they don't mean what
they say but you got to be careful about
that because if you're that implying put
me in charge and I will tame
denne deficit well you might be you know
tying your own hands exactly about what
you can do once you get in charge it's
possible that it is a perfectly fine
electoral message it's not gonna fire up
the bass but to the extent you're trying
to win in swing areas and pick off right
leading swing voters it may well be a
useful message to use but you gotta be
extraordinarily careful of how you use
it because you don't want to shut off a
policy avenues that you want to pursue

this video was made possible by class
central.com / Pakman which lets you
watch tens of thousands of lectures from
the world's best universities check it
out by clicking the link underneath the
video this episode of the pseudo-science
mini series is about psychics a psychic
claims to have extrasensory perception
ESP the ability to receive information
through means other than the five
recognized physical senses clairvoyance
seeing the future or past talking to
dead people are examples I actually
covered ESP in a previous episode of the
mini series in this video we'll talk
about the actual techniques that
psychics use to fool people for about 90
years science has tested supernatural
claims by psychics and we have no proof
that it actually exists the scientific
consensus remains that there is no
evidence that psychics have supernatural
powers so let's jump right into it
sometimes psychics do background
research about their subject either
themselves or through a third party in
some cases this is preparing for what's
called a hot reading in a hot reading
the psychic has collected information
about their subject in advance and often
psychics will read their subjects on the
spot without knowing them or any
detailed information about them and
that's called cold reading and that's
about sizing up your subject and using
techniques to increase the probability
that you'll say things that seem
accurate people often don't realize how
much information you can infer just from
seeing someone noticing their behavior
even just talking for a few minutes and
before a cold reading a psychic can tell
a lot from physical appearance age
gender ethnicity body language the way
someone talks and dresses their hair
these things and others are important
clues about a person and things that are
probably happening in that person's life
that's the first step for a psychic
during a cold reading and knowing how to
use those Clues is a big part of it the
rest is a game of probability when a
psychic is cold reading an audience
they'll do what's called shotgunning
throwing out vague ideas
hoping something sticks and that
somebody will say yeah that's that's me
the psychic might say I'm sensing that
someone has lost a loved one or someone
is struggling with their health or
having money problems and if you've got
a big enough crowd it's a common or
general enough prediction it probably
ensures that the psychic seems
successful now when working one-on-one
psychics benefit from using what are
known as Barnum statements which could
apply to almost anyone examples would be
sometimes you're too critical of
yourself you don't live up to your true
potential in a certain aspect of your
life you can find it sometimes to be
unwise to tell people too much about
yourself almost anybody would relate to
these statements but in the heat of the
moment during a reading it's easy to be
tricked into thinking that the psychic
actually knows something about you
individually there's a variation of
Barnum statements called the rainbow
ruse and that's a statement that
attributes a personality trait to
someone but also attributes the opposite
okay so a couple of examples would be
you're a driven person
but you sometimes succumb to laziness
well yeah that applies to most people
right because it's a and the opposite of
a you like to be the life of the party
but sometimes you feel more reserved
these are often interpreted as accurate
because not only is the trait relatable
to almost anybody the psychic also
assigns the opposite of the trait and
all bases are covered
everybody has conflicting traits or
traits that manifest sometimes but not
all the time
psychics also like to pretend they know
the names of people in your life someone
that died or someone you broke up with
when psychics make guesses about names
they usually use common names or lists
the series of names or even the first
letter of a name until they get a hit
and psychics can narrow it down by using
common names to the demographic of the
subject like age or ethnicity I'm
sensing that you care very much about
someone whose name starts with s this
increases the odds because it's less
specific and it allows the psychic to
say they were talking about the first
name or maybe it was the last name a
really common one is
I'm getting a J or a G sound this is two
different letters and according to the
Social Security Administration 38 of the
most popular 200 names in the u.s. from
the last hundred years start with either
J or G combine that with other vague
criteria like it's someone in your
family or someone you work with and it
is very likely that the psychic gets a
hit when predicting or reading causes of
death
psychics usually stick to common causes
of death in the u.s. these are heart
disease cancer accidents and strokes if
a psychic says I'm sensing that you know
someone who has died of cancer there's a
good chance they're going to be right
even knowing someone alive with cancer
could appear to be a hit even though the
person is still alive and not dead or
the psychic could be even more vague and
say I'm sensing you know someone who had
a heart problem or issues with their
lungs it's definitely something related
to the chest
how many conditions could that apply to
sometimes the psychic will start
specific see if there's a hit and get
more vague until they get a hit or they
can say that what they're talking about
is actually just a metaphor for
something else and vagueness always
plays in their favor are you having
problems with your neck no what about
your head headaches right now maybe it's
something with the head of your company
did you get a new boss at work oh you
did get a new boss well the head is a
symbol for boss in this particular case
keep in mind when you're dealing with
someone who has already paid to consult
a psychic they want the psychics powers
to be real powers when a psychic keeps
missing the mark or someone refuses to
play along they'll often say well you
just don't yet realize that I'm right or
this is something you should look into
or you've got to be on the lookout for
or you'll later remember how this
relates psychics actually depend on the
subject to do most of the work because
when we're interacting with someone we
give all sorts of clues we're not aware
of what our eyes do how we hold our arms
or our posture and psychics are good at
responding to these
in real time if someone nods or looks
intrigued the psychic will stop talking
and allow the person to fill in the
blanks with information if the subject
looks confused
the psychic will rattle off more ideas
until something sticks
this makes the missus less obvious and
the subject might forget that there were
misses at all cold reading is a very
intricate technique and psychics can be
extremely good with practice there's
more to cold reading than I can cover in
this video but that's why it's so
powerfully deceptive because most people
don't fully understand how it actually
works and its power check out the
example of Theresa Caputo she has a
reality show on TLC called Long Island
medium she's one of the most well-known
psychics right now she claims to talk to
the dead and she charges people hundreds
of dollars to come to her live events
when she's on tour he also wants me to
tell you cuz I felt the restriction
again he says I want you to know that
before I hit that water I was already
gone do you understand that he says
everyone says that I drowned he says I
want them to know that I didn't suffer
he says Theresa everything happened so
quickly it was like boom boom boom
psychics who say they talk to the dead
are usually dealing with emotionally
vulnerable subjects they want closure or
insight about the person they lost and
usually it's someone who already
believes in psychic abilities to begin
with so they want it to work they
believe it can work the subject can be
too distracted or emotionally
defenseless to recognize the tricks and
this combined with psychics having good
cold reading skills means a perfect
formula for creating situations where
the subject is willing to go along with
whatever the psychic says in this clip
remember that the woman being read is
someone who wants to participate and
believes in the psychic powers of
Theresa Caputo if your mother isn't a
party it could be your grandmother
mother-in-law
maybe it's your mother who has died or
another woman in your family she's
talking to a woman who appears to be
about 45 years old
chances are pretty good that she has a
mother grandmother or mother-in-law who
has died where does the mother come in
where does the mother figure come in I
know that's not who you want yeah no my
mother's still with me back that's right
I know that so my grandmother come in if
the woman being read had said yes it's
my mom who died the psychic could have
said yeah see exactly I'm psychic but
that was a no so now we're changing it
to mother figure Oh your mom is still
alive well yeah no I knew that I'm
talking about your grandmother or a
mother figure or maybe Mother Earth as a
symbol for Humanity or maybe it's mother
Goose I mean at this point who knows I
don't care if it's an aunt that was like
a mother to you okay okay it has to be
someone of that nature but she talks
about jewelry so I don't know if you
have her jewelry or there was something
that you were supposed to inherit or and
or have another miss Theresa is then
told that it was actually the woman's
father who died so Theresa tries to say
okay your father saw your kids receive
an award or graduate from school you
have children yes it was it just
something with you children because he
just brought me to when they bring me to
an elementary school they put me on a
stage it's just my symbol for where
someone either received an award or they
was just a graduation well he no he
never got to meet my kids
oh he died oh he never met your kids
okay perfect that's exactly what I meant
then she says is the number three
relevant to you at all how do you
connect with the number three you have
three children I have well I have two
children I guess Karen no I didn't have
a miscarriage but I hear she says no I
didn't have a miscarriage and Theresa
Caputo goes mmm I guess suggesting to
this woman that yes maybe you did have a
miscarriage but you didn't know it just
so that her psychic vision will seem
accurate unbelievable here's Theresa
Caputo on Anderson Cooper's old daytime
talk show this is a really good example
of the shotgunning technique
throwing out a bunch of ideas in a large
room of people and hoping that there is
a match somebody lost a spouse newly and
someone also lost a sister and someone
is also wearing the mother or
grandmothers religious articles whether
if it's like a miraculous metal across
rosary beads or they brought them with
them there seem to be hundreds of people
in this room many are most of whom are
at least middle-aged chances are pretty
good that somebody in the room has lost
a spouse or sister or is wearing a
family member's religious jewelry who
lost the spouse I think I'm right I'm
right here is your wife departed your
wife is departed okay cuz she just she
said next see what she said just sit
down just sit down would that be her
personality to say just you know maybe
don't don't speak up yet quite so much
is that her wedding ring my mother's
which all cuz I heard some the wedding
ring and your that's your mom's wedding
ring yes it is this is my wife's wedding
ring here oh you have the wedding ring
but where is the chair why do I keep
getting the thing with the chair do you
still have her chair no or did she have
an issue with her legs prior to her
passing no she had a swing and a Miss
okay that guy wasn't working out so well
so I'm going to ask a roomful of 200
people if they know something about legs
and move on what the issue with the legs
paralyzed or something amputated was
there an issue with the legs where your
husband was his bed restriction is that
correct what was with his legs she well
she shade that point is she's shaking
her head no so that's fine look you
don't have to acknowledge it I don't
care
Wow and then she basically tells this
woman that she's a liar because she
denied having lost someone who had
problems with their legs I don't care if
he believed in what I do that's not what
they just accept that yeah I'm sorry
you're afraid what about me I'm talking
to dead people
[Applause]
Caputo is great about using humor to
lighten the mood and connect with the
subjects and distract them psychics who
talked to the dead are especially vile
because they exploit profound sadness it
makes the subject more agreeable it
gives them a false way of dealing with
their grief and there's always the
question do psychics know that what
they're doing is BS with some psychics
we could give them the benefit of the
doubt some psychics probably do think
that they have special powers you can be
an expert cold reader and have no idea
that that's what you're actually doing
you have lots of practice you've gotten
great at it but you have no idea because
you continue to improve at cold reading
recognizing cues people give an
understanding probability and you seem
to be a psychic but there are many
psychics who do know that they're frauds
and once you've realized how easy it is
to make money doing it maybe it's
difficult to stop it is how they make a
living after all and many psychics like
Theresa Caputo rationalize what they're
doing they justify it in moral terms
they say it doesn't matter if you
believe it's real because it gives
people a way to deal with the loss of a
loved one or a way to be introspective
about their problems and of course
whether it's helping anyone has nothing
to do with whether it's real bottom line
psychics aren't the people to rely on to
help solve your problems psychics can't
tell you anything about your life that
you don't already know maybe you'd be
better off seeing a doctor or a
therapist an accountant or a lawyer even
to solve problems that you're actually
facing in the real world

so last week we talked about democratic
socialism versus social democracy and I
talked to you about how especially since
Alexandria Acacio cortezes win in New
York there has been sort of more and
more confusion as to what is democratic
socialism versus what is social
democracy and I did a story explaining
the difference democratic socialism is
actually socialism wants to remove
capitalism and replace it with
socialized ownership of the means of
production at least originally although
now there are people who say well
there's still democratic socialists but
they don't actually want that which
makes me question whether they're
actually democratic socialists at this
point and then on the other hand we
talked about social democracy which is a
progressive movement that wants to work
within a market economy within
capitalism and make it more of what I
call a socially guided market economy
and the difference is massive and the
confusion between these two systems is
very very problematic and the top
response that I got from people in the
audience was I mean of course other than
trolling was what's your position David
and I've mentioned before that I'm not a
socialist I'm a Social Democrat in the
sort of Nordic or Swedish tradition and
today I'm going to explain to you why I
am NOT a socialist and I'm happy to do
this it's something that's been an area
of study for me since undergraduate and
even even including in graduate school
and I'm gonna start sort of at the end
and then we'll walk through it
fundamentally I'm not a socialist
because I want an egalitarian free
self-determining Society and that type
of society will not emerge from
authoritarian apparatus and what that
means is that at the national level
socialist and communist structures are
fundamentally authoritarian and at scale
enacting socialism or communism becomes
authoritarian and a top example is
Venezuela let's assume in good faith
that the Shabbos Maduro goal was a truly
egalitarian free thriving society I
don't know if it was but let's be
charitable
right and they really did want that as
the end goal when you put aside the
populist collectivist rhetoric of that
regime the Venezuelan regime is an
authoritarian imposition of government
without all sorts of freedoms lacking in
press freedom lacking in judicial
freedom it's a long list and I'm opposed
to it and whatever their intern
intentions were their imposition of
those intentions in this authoritarian
way has led to absolute disaster and
some socialists Leninists will say that
the opposition to the Venezuelan regime
is American astroturf or that the
replacement to Maduro might be worse
step back for a second an authoritarian
apparatus will not lead to an
egalitarian self-determining society
period but before we get to all of the
conclusions we need to talk about what
we mean when we say socialism or
communism
when did it start what does it actually
mean so for our conversation today when
I talk about socialism I'm talking about
modern socialism and communism in the
tradition of the 19th century and if you
go back to our socialism has never
worked debunked video we mentioned older
societies and sort of collectivist
iterations of economic arrangements but
for today we're talking about modern
socialist theory and that dates back
roughly to about the 1800s and there are
three main lines of socialist theory
almost no one who likes to talk about
socialism on the internet actually knows
about this stuff this is really
important as the nuts-and-bolts first
you had the utopians in the 19th century
these are people like Sen C Mon Fourier
and Owen and their idea was that there
would be the development of these
collectivist egalitarian sort of perfect
as the name utopian implies societies
sometimes in isolated enclaves and they
would eventually spread and I actually
do believe that individually they can
work but once you say this is the system
for the country
it becomes authoritarian in its
implementation you'll develop conflicts
between these utopian enclaves but as
usual there was some good stuff proposed
there okay their Theory applied to an
individual company or a commune or a
village it's actually a pretty good idea
I've just not seen evidence that utopian
Theory can apply to a country of 300
million for example but I'm willing to
have my mind changed after the utopians
came the anarchists the sort of second
wave second line of socialists and the
main thing with the anarchist was that
government is the problem they were
actually a lot like the more extreme
libertarians of today for different
reasons than libertarianism the
anarchist socialist saw the government
mostly as an apparatus that reinforces
the status quo of class divisions
bourgeoisie versus proletariat or today
we could say corporate versus individual
interests or elites versus everybody
else and libertarians of course oppose
government for different reasons but
there was actually a similarity there
and that also doesn't appeal to me as
most people know I'm against this on
principle I think that the government
does have a role to play but that being
said the anarchists had some valid
critiques governments often do become
pillars of support for corporate rule
they do reinforce the status quo they do
reinforce power structures I've seen no
evidence that eliminating the government
is the solution in the way that the
anarcho socialists or the libertarians
believed super-interesting that even
though now libertarians and socialists
are mostly diametrically opposed some of
the original strains of socialist
thought had a lot in common with
libertarianism they agree they don't
want central government because it's
oppressive and tyrannical but for
different reasons and then after the
utopians and after the anarchists you
get to what are now the most common
versions of socialism after utopianism
and anarchism came Marxist Leninist it
together or Marxism and then Leninism
they're not actually the same thing and
they're once again there is stuff of
value if people could realize that many
of the critiques made by socialism are
actually really good we'd be much better
off some of the solutions they proposed
have only elements of good ideas and in
Marxism its the labor theory of value
extraordinarily brilliant analysis of
how capitalism works which basically
pointed out that you have fixed costs
like if you're gonna make a product if
you're gonna make computers for example
you've got your fixed material costs
you've got the factory you need to buy
the semiconductors all of that stuff and
then you bring in workers and you pay
them something with the idea that they
add more than that to the total value
and that's surplus value you might have
in a hundred dollar computer fifty
dollars of parts and then fifty dollars
of added value if you can pay the worker
thirty dollars to add fifty dollars of
value you've created twenty dollars of
surplus value this is a great analysis
this is this is an absolutely accurate
analysis the problem is I don't believe
the ultimate solution to that
identification is the end stage of
capitalism with a Marxist revolution
that's not what I see is the long term
solution
so again utopianism i don't think it
would work at the country level but for
individual companies or communes i think
it's actually a great idea to organize
co-ops and and shared ownership great
that has worked we can apply it to
healthcare we can apply to education i
don't see that as the solution to all of
society anarchism skeptical of
government government has become a tool
of the elites in many ways we see it in
the united states with democrats and
republicans using government as a way to
maintain the status quo it's a good
critique I disagree that eliminating
government is the solution and so what
previously had been sort of a cohesive
movement but with different approaches
utopianism anarchism Marxism Leninism
eventually what we saw around the time
of Lenin was a split between actual
socialists and those who went in the
direction of social democracy and I
believe that there are a number of
reasons why social democracy is the way
forward and socialism is not and in
explaining this to you you'll identify
many right-wing arguments against
socialism which I actually don't think
are good ones and this gets to one of my
fundamental opposition's to socialism's
view of the distributions of outcomes
versus social democracies socialism in
the Marxist Leninist sort of tradition
is simply not aligned with the realities
of human distribution because when we
look at human endeavors they have
unequal distribution if you look at
athletic ability and how its distributed
if you look at linguistic proficiency if
you look at business success if you look
at human height human weight it's all
distributed on a curve and on the one
hand where socialism wants to level out
the distribution in a way that I've not
seen evidence can actually be achieved
without significant downsides with
social democracy wants to do is tweak
that distribution lower the app salute
top raise the bottom a little bit and
then reduce the gap between the very
bottom and the very top you're sort of
leveling it out you're raising the mean
and reducing the difference between top
and bottom I think it's important to
look at Sweden as an example the right
hates looking at Sweden Sweden's Social
Democratic Party which I identify with
was built on five principles that will
sound really familiar to Social
Democrats to people who follow Bernie
Sanders and those five principles were
number one an integrative democracy that
means and we can leave this up that
means that democratic decision-making is
the standard for legitimacy period real
democracy the people decide the
direction
number two the concept of the people's
home meaning solidarity and equality of
treatment as something that everybody is
committed to it there's no debate right
you need that number three
socio-economic equality and economic
efficiency are complementary these are
often considered opposing forces by the
capitalists right the the vulture
capitalists which is you can either have
an economically efficient society or one
that is more equal the social democratic
tradition actually sees those as
complimentary number four you have a
socially can
for old market economy and this is huge
it's still a market economy it's still
capitalism but the economy's direction
and the priorities are determined
socially doesn't mean society owns the
means of production as in socialism but
society guides the market economy and v
proper expansion of the public sector
expands freedom and freedom of choice
think about it health care for all
let's people get the jobs that are
actually their passion socialized
education means that people can really
study what they want rather than
deciding on the cheapest career to avoid
student loans this is all in line with
my ideology but it still exists within a
capitalist market economy that allows
for Entrepreneurship and
individualization and all of the good
things that come from the natural
diversity of people now when you talk
about Sweden and you talk to the right
they will try to destroy these talking
points and you've got to know how they
try to do it a popular when one is okay
that that worked in Sweden because
Sweden is homogeneous it's all white
it wouldn't work in a diverse country
this is patently absurd okay
the u.s. is 77 percent white Sweden is
85 percent white okay the idea that
those eight percentage points are what
make a system work in Sweden and not in
the u.s. is absolutely laughable it's
also funny the hypocrisy that many
right-wing or simultaneously claimed
Sweden is being taken over by brown
immigrants and it's chaos but at the
same time
Sweden works really well because
everybody is white that should make
everybody say wait wait a second that
doesn't really make sense
consider the counterpoint if the United
States were all white would the Swedish
model work it's absurd the United States
is huge and with such differences in
education and religion and so many other
things just making the US all white
would not be what either makes or
doesn't make the Swedish system works
now here is where the critique actually
defends social democracy over socialism
a totally socialist society whether
Marxist or utopian or anarchist or
Leninist in the US would actually be
impossible
but what wouldn't be impossible would be
socializing certain elements of American
society health care for example very
doable large countries socialized
healthcare education education could be
put into sort of the umbrella of social
welfare in the United States that's the
Social Democratic model that I support
one other argument from the right which
is they say it works in Sweden because
Sweden is small and the u.s. is big
that's part of why I believe that total
socialism actually is not the path
forward but that there are social Liza
Balcon ponents which would work
absolutely fine in the United States so
to sort of give you the highlights of
why I'm not a socialist and I am a
social democrat I believe that a
socially directed market economy that
reduces income inequality and ensures a
real standard of living for everybody is
more realistic and it's also more in
line with human nature which actually
shows that there is distribution when it
comes to any endeavor that humans get
involved in and I fundamentally and this
gets back to the real reason that I so
vehemently oppose what we see going on
in Venezuela and what we see and have
seen in other places around the world I
do not believe because I've seen no
evidence that an egalitarian
self-determining free society will
develop from an authoritarian apparatus
period I'm willing to change my mind so
let me know your thoughts I'm on Twitter
at D Pakman and the show is on Twitter
at David Pakman show and I look forward
to dialogue on this issue going forward
I'm really thrilled to tell you that

not that we needed more evidence to
question the mental stability of the
president but he spent his weekend
obviously at one of his golf resorts
this time the one in New Jersey spent
his weekend tweeting about various
conspiracies and of course about
Hillary's emails he's been president for
a year and a half and he's still
tweeting about Hillary's emails and it's
very quickly becoming like having
conspiracy theorists Alex Jones as
president of the United States Donald
Trump tweeting rife with the bizarre
grammar and capitalization that we've
become accustomed to over the weekend
quote the rigged witch-hunt originally
headed by FBI loverboy Peter S for one
year and now thirteen angry Democrats
should look into the missing DNC server
crooked Hillary's illegally deleted

one Podesta and so much more
it's a Democrat con job I don't know
where to start okay so let this is like
under fifty words I think I counted it's
like forty seven words here's what he
has squeezed into this small number of
words which is actually a sort of
literary achievement to squeeze this
much nonsense into only forty seven
words he calls the Russia investigation
of witch-hunt no evidence of that that's
a popular one of for Trump the Peter
asks that he refers to his Peters struck
this is the guy who was an FBI agent
didn't head the investigation he was one
of many people that were involved and
once his anti-trump text messages came
to light he was removed from the
investigation in fact the handling of
the Peter Strock situation was done 100%
correctly and has not yet not indicative
of any wrongdoing by the FBI Trump then
talks about thirteen angry Democrats
that's Trump claiming that thirteen
Democrats at the FBI run the entire
investigation which is court of course
not true and as you probably know Robert
Muller the guy in charge he's a lifelong
Republican Trump references a missing
DNC server there are missing records of
all kinds on both Democratic and
Republican sides not really a unique
thing we have a problem in our governor
with records going missing talks about
Hillary's emails Hillary lost almost two
years ago I don't know why he's still
talking about Hillary's emails he even
said that even though his priority was
going to be to lock her up that it's not
actually going to be so why he's talking
about it I don't know then he mentions
this Pakistani fraudster now that you
may not have heard about that refers to
an individual whose last name is a Wan
who's connected to a government IT
situation a Wan was a former IT aide for
Debbie wasserman-schultz and he made
unauthorized access to the servers of
the House of Representatives but again
it has nothing to do with the Trump
Russia investigation whatsoever he
brings up uranium one that's of course
the completely debunked conspiracy
theory that there's different versions
of it but one is Hillary illegally gave
all of our uranium to Russia and there's
actually even crazier versions of that
one even Shepard Smith on Fox News
debunked it and then he just says
Podesta that's not really anything
that's just referring to John John
Podesta is a person he refers to John
Podesta but that's not really anything a
single 47 word tweet with eight
distortions or straight-up conspiracy
theories
well David the president is busy he
works something like 20 hours a day he
barely sleeps yes you know ending the
Korean War on Monday and resuscitating
the coal industry on Tuesday he doesn't
have time to fact-check he doesn't have
time to spellcheck you're expecting too
much from him this is what happens when
you have an Alex Jones presidency or
some guy who watches Fox News in the
Oval Office and it's not how a stable
genius behaves and if you're Justin
Trudeau or a Manuel McCrone or Angela
Merkel Angela Merkel what do you think
when you see this stuff and actually we
know what they think and we know that
Trump doesn't care what they think
because he's alienated them completely
what does Putin think when he sees this
stuff he thinks everything's going
exactly to plan and is very very pleased
we have yet another victim of the Trump
tax cuts and they are the potential
employees of BMW who were not going to
be hired who are not going to get a job
because BMW is choosing to expand in
China in
stead of the United States so for now
BMW is introducing production in the US
although Trump has sort of talked about
getting German cars off American roads
which was really weird because a lot of
those companies employ many American
workers but BMW is choosing to expand
their manufacturing in China instead of
the United States and starting next year
BMW is going to produce more than half a
million cars in China last year about a
third of the cars sold in China were
actually imported from other countries
including SUVs made in the United States
and of course as you probably know by
now Trump put a 25% additional tariff on
thirty four billion dollars in Chinese
imports this includes cars so China has
also retaliated when it comes to that
and BMW smartly obviously like I'm not
cheering it but I understand why they're
doing it they say well we're gonna avoid
the tariffs by making the cars that we
sell in China in China to begin with and
these are jobs that could have gone to
American workers Trump said he wanted to
help American workers but these are jobs
that are going to go to the Chinese
instead and yesterday I've been thinking
about what's the endgame here right how
can we get off of this escalating trade
war and contrary to what Trump has said
trade wars aren't always good and
they're not always easy to win but if
they're going to end both sides need to
know what they need to have happen in
order to end them there's no indication
Trump knows what he would need he's
vaguely talked about China's unfair to
us on trade and they steal our
intellectual property okay well how do
you make that a policy if China just
says we won't steal intellectual
property anymore is that enough will
that get Trump to say we're ready to end
this and unfortunately there are lots of
people who are emailing me saying if
only X happened we could just undo these
tariffs and go back to where we were I
hate to break it to you but nearly a
dozen economic experts are saying that
once you have tariffs like these in
place it takes a while to remove them
and very often even before negotiations
happen around the
specifically you'll see countries see if
they can maybe come to agreements on
other things sort of like proxy
negotiations there's thought they're
gonna start to feel out can we cooperate
on other geopolitical issues if and when
it feels like progress has been made
then you would look at the idea of
scaling down the tariff so Trump very
quickly irrationally haphazardly started
the tariffs didn't seem like he knew
much about trade or what the impacts
would be and now we're going to be stuck
with this for a long time because these
off ramps can take a long time to
actually put in place and step one is
the Trump administration needs to be
clear about what they want it's not even
clear that they know it right now Trump
says treat us fairly on trade well what
does that look like Trump says China
needs to stop stealing intellectual
property well what does that look like
when it comes to an agreement and would
he just take the Chinese president's
word on that they don't know because
they're clueless and this was done
haphazardly good luck getting out of
this any time soon you know it by now
when I say there was a moment of truth
or of clarity or of honesty on Fox News
it's almost always Shepard Smith except
when it isn't Fox News anchor
commentator I don't even know really
what her role is at this point Dagan
McDowell
she said what we all know is true which
is that if President Obama pulled the
tariffs that Trump is now putting in
place the right would be calling for
Obama's head if you thought that the
right went nuts when Trump when Obama
rather wore a tan suit just imagine what
the right would have done if Obama had
placed tariffs on our key allies and
suppliers of products and dagen mcdowell
says something which is actually very
uncontroversial it's obviously true it's
just kind of out of place on Fox News
you're right the market is really
tolerating this the market has not
collapsed and certainly the economy in
the second quarter is growing at a great
clip so maybe we can handle this but
this strategy that we talked about has
not been it laid out clearly and we've
heard about
retaliation the European Europe has
talked about coming back with tariffs on
300 billion dollars in goods which is
one-fifth of all of our exports every
year so there is a grave concern and
I'll point this out if President Obama
had pulled what we've seen in the last
six months we would be shouting to the
high heavens blowing the roof off this
bill would be absolutely ways faster
when everybody talks at the same time
but digging McDowell was absolutely
right if Obama did this the right would
be saying this is protectionist nanny
government Indonesian Kenyan Muslim
foreign-born Barack Hussein Obama
screwing us again but Obama wasn't
ignorant enough or depraved enough or
delusional enough to try to start a
trade war with half the world so yes
right-wing media would have lost their
minds if Obama did this put Obama never
would have thought of even proposing
something like this yeah and really you
can make this hypocrisy point on just
about every political issue I think
she's making it here though because
there are many Republicans there out
there who are in support of free trade
who are also against these tariffs is
safer you know the Koch brothers are too
and probably the people who run Fox News
so it is very safe I mentioned soybean
farmers yesterday and NPR had an
interesting piece about soybean farmers
who by and large in the Midwest support
Donald Trump and they're getting very
nervous about these tariffs but they
mostly still support Donald Trump and
these people are sticking with Trump
even as he destroys their industries and
I want to show you the level of
cognitive dissonance that's going on
there was an article in Kansas City calm
they went to Poplar Bluff Missouri
ravaged by these tariffs almost
immediately and here are quotes just
from people in the community okay it
would be a detriment to our community
said Carol McGee but when you look at
the bigger picture blaming him solely
meaning Trump is not necessarily
accurate well he chose to do this entire
tariff proposal who else are you gonna
blame I guess whoever gave him the idea
probably wasn't his idea
also from this Kansas
calm article he's the only one who
hasn't lied about what he was going to
do in office insists Eric Turner a chef
so although the tariffs he's going to
drive although through the tariffs quote
he's going to drive up the cost of
everything people are still going to
stand behind him that's exactly right
they are going through and it's horrible
also from the article Faust son Sean
said if his friends who work there do
lose their jobs quote I don't think it
will turn them against the president
even if on the surface it's going to
look bad I agree they're not gonna turn
against the guy another quote from the
article there is going to be some
short-term pain says nurse anesthetist
Don Faust and I don't like for anyone to
have pain in their lives but we've had
unfair trade directed against the US for
years and we've just taken it so some of
these things are gonna have to happen
before some of these economic issues get
hashed out these people don't know
anything about trade Trump is convinced
them with his vague proclamations about
being treated unfairly that he knows the
solutions to the trade problem guy
doesn't even actually understand the
problem and people who know nothing
about economics are now blindly saying
Trump's identified the problems could be
a little rough in the meantime but
ultimately we're going to get the
solutions the solutions are going to
come when Trump's replacement
comes up with the solutions they're not
going to come under Trump and this is
why you have to vote in November because
these people are telling you doesn't
matter how bad it gets doesn't matter
how bad it gets for me or my town or my
state there's some bigger picture
strategy that Trump has here and they're
going to continue supporting him so Rudy
Giuliani appeared on ABC's program this
week with George Stephanopoulos and he
seemed to I guess inadvertently unless
it's part of some campaign to
deliberately so confusion which it very
well may be Giuliani
appeared to admit that Donald Trump
obstructed justice by asking James Comey
then FBI director to give indicted
National Security Advisor Michael Flynn
a break in the Russia probe and Rudy
Giuliani insists out of one side of his
mouth that there's just nothing to see
here
but then he admits that well yeah the
President did say specific
things to james comey about how to
handle the Michael Flynn situation which
would be a way of in a literal sense
getting in the way
obstructing interfering the natural
course of justice being carried out by
an investigation the clip is stunning it
is only 28 seconds but it contains so
much wackiness that i want you to pay
really close attention to these 28
seconds I mean the reality is Comey
in some ways ends up being a good
witness for us unless you assume they're
trying to get him into a perjury trap by
he tells his version somebody else has a
different version how is he a good
witness for the president if he's saying
that the president was asking directing
him and his words to let the Michael son
investigation go he didn't direct him to
do that what he said to him was can you
can you give Comey says he took it as
directly that's okay I'm taking it that
way I meant by that time you have been
fired and you said a lot of other things
some of which has turned out to be
untrue this is just completely untrue I
mean he's completely revising the
timeline into one that if my current
understanding of time is moving forward
and we can't like travel back in time or
change the past currently like that's my
understanding and maybe in the future
these are things we'll be able to do I
don't think Giuliani is referring to
sort of like a break in the space-time
continuum here this is not the way it
happened Rudy Giuliani who is Trump's
own lawyer is admitting that during the
time when Jeff bi director James Comey
was FBI director he was told by the
President to look at giving a break to
National Security Advisor
Michael Flynn that is direction when it
comes to a specific invest investigate
and it is obstruction of justice and I
know I know
unless Trump is impeached it won't make
a difference you likely can't indict a
sitting president but that doesn't
change whether it's obstruction and it
is and the executive branch directing
the FBI to handle a particular
investigation in a particular way
including being lacks right giving Flynn
a break that is asking for before there
is a an actual indictment before there
is a trial before there is a sentencing
it's saying just give them a break on
the entire thing which which of course
at that phase in the investigation means
maybe let the entire thing go is George
Stefon
points out now remember this also
contradicts that Trump said when asked
this exact same thing last year that he
never said anything like it to James
Comey so Giuliani Trump's personal
lawyer is making this comment from Trump
last year appeared to be shocker untrue
Thank You mr. president in the light of
a very busy news week a lot of people
would like to get to the bottom of a
couple of things give you a chance to go
on record here did you at any time
urge former FBI director James Comey in
any way shape or form to close or to
back down the investigation into Michael
Flynn and also as you know next question
well his whole lawyer Rudy Giuliani is
now saying the opposite and at first
Rudy Giuliani said he was contradicting
Trump remember when he was first hired
by Trump and then he said all sorts of
things that were the opposite of what
Trump said he said well I was just hired
and I'm kind of trying to figure things
out later he was asked about it and he
said well those were just rumors right
rumors created by him apparently he
wrote them off as just rumors what's the
excuse now and I'm not asking
rhetorically I genuinely am wondering
how is it that Rudy Giuliani continues
to directly contradict Trump and is it a
strategy merely to create confusion yeah
why do they keep putting him on the
sunday talk shows I know he had a few
week hiatus
yes you're really gonna put this guy
back he keeps putting his foot in his
mouth and you would have imagined that
was the hiatus during which he was
informing himself about the relevant
facts related to all of this stuff but
apparently not I think in the end
pardons are gonna be flying soon and
none of this stuff is gonna matter and
we like to think in general that people
know what they're doing but we are aware
of these ideas that 80% of people are
incompetent at what they do
we still imagine that okay even if 80%
of lawyers are sometimes incompetent the
president's lawyers those would be the
best people and maybe that's not the
case unless of course this is and this
is a counter-argument people emailed me
about they said something along the
lines of Rudy Giuliani is contradicting
Trump to obfuscate and confuse so that
no one really knows what's true and
becomes distrustful of everything that
they hear and just kind of give up on
figuring out what's going on which is
less like 1984 by
well but more like brave new world by
Aldous Huxley that is more reminiscent
of what was laid out by Aldous Huxley
which is who even really knows what's
true I'll just figure out something else
to think about yeah you were talking
about the confusion over when you know
if time is moving forward or backward or
what's going on with that maybe that's
the 40 chests that they're talking about
always yes it's 7 dimensional underwater
chess played only when it's completely
dark out between the hours of 2 a.m. and
4 a.m. and somehow they're playing
they're playing the game masterfully or
something like that if an investigation
were about to end would the guy running
the investigation hire even more
prosecutors you tell me Donald Trump has
been telling us for a long time now that
we're almost at the end of this thing
the Moller investigation is just about
to end we heard last year that it would
be over by Thanksgiving 2017 when it
didn't end we were told it would be over
by New Year's Day January 1 2018
that didn't happen throughout early 2018
and even over the last month or so we've
[Music]
the david pakman show at david
pakman.com we're gonna start today with
a media story I'm gonna present to you
today the epitome of right wing media
dishonesty and distortion and it's gonna
be specifically talking about the
economy and employment numbers so last
week as often happens in the first few
days of a new month we get the jobs
numbers from the previous month
we got them late last week from June
there were totally unremarkable job
numbers for June more or less a
continuation of similar numbers that we
saw what we saw under President Obama
213 thousand jobs were added during the
Obama administration 214 thousand jobs
per month were added that was during
Obama's second term the unemployment
rate went up slightly to 4% very small
change I've been telling you for years
and years how the unemployment rate is
calculated it's been calculated the same
way for a very long time very often when
you have low unemployment numbers under
a Democratic president you will see
Republicans say when people stopped
looking for work they're no longer
counted as unemployed so the number
doesn't mean anything and then all of a
sudden when a Republican has low
unemployment numbers Republicans seem to
completely forget that they were
critical of how that number is
formulated when it was Barack Obama or a
Democrat what we do often see
Republicans talk about when there is a
Democrat in the White House is the
number of people who are not working
sometimes this is used interchangeably
with the labor force participation rate
and I've been telling you for a year
after year after year that the raw
number of people that are working or the
raw number of people that are not
working the labor force participation
rate they are very often misleading
sometimes useless and almost 100 percent
of the time
those numbers are used for political
gain by whoever is looking to distort
the reality of the economy it
communicates almost nothing about to the
about the economy to say X number of
people are working and the headline that
Drudge Report right-wing propaganda
sludge report ran when the June numbers
came out red record 155 million employed
this is presumably the number of people
with jobs in the United States I am also
going to show you the headline from the
same website Drudge Report on March 8th
of 2013 when Barack Obama was president
the headline read eighty nine point
three million not working the number of
people not who are unemployed but people
who aren't in the labor force right so
when Drudge said eighty nine million not
working that included retired people
that included full-time college students
it included stay-at-home parents who
don't need to work because they are
well-off financially and what you need
to understand to realize how you are
being manipulated or there are attempts
to manipulate you with these numbers
remember that the population of the
United States has been going up forever
at many times in American history there
have been record numbers of people
working at the same time that you had
record numbers of people not working you
can display either number to make a
political point and case in point as I
told you a month ago maybe it was two
months ago
there are also a record number of people
not working right now just as right now
we have if you believe the numbers from
Drudge Report more people than ever
working because there are more people in
the United States than ever before the
numbers mean nothing
and following Drudge Report right-wing
media just jumped all over this thing as
if it was some miracle and I hate to
break it to them but sometimes record
numbers of people working isn't a
positive thing and I'll explain the
percentage not the number
the percentage of people over 85 years
of age 85 or older working today is very
high
back in 2006 before the the recession
2.6 percent of those 85 or older were
working 2.6 percent today you have
almost twice as many people over age 85
working they're part of the victorious
great economy of record numbers of
people working right well hold on let's
just think about it for a second some
people who are over age 85 were working
because they want to some people over
age 85 are working because 85 year olds
are slightly healthier today than they
were in 2006 on average although there
hasn't actually been that big of a
change but overall when you read that
part of the record number of people
working is a higher than ever rate of 85
plus year-olds you have to think about
it and realize wait a second there's
more eighty five year olds than ever
working because they have to because
wages are stagnant because cost of
living goes up as wages are stagnant and
Pat this is how the right-wing media
spins these bogus narratives they put up
a number record 155 million working it
means nothing and it becomes the talking
point for the month of July yeah I
remember shortly after the Trump
administration began Sean Spicer was
saying that the president didn't believe
the strong jobs numbers under Obama
right but now the Trump is president he
obviously does believe them but I mean
that that was at least delivered
somewhat tongue-in-cheek I guess it's a
lot of epoxy when he said that it wasn't
clear whether it was like a 90 percent
joke or a 50 percent joke but there was
like some understanding of the political
nature of the numbers it was the Drudge
Report they're trying to deceive you and
sightings actually succeeded with many
of us they do and unfortunately the
audience that it is being delivered to
is eating it up like it is being just
ladle fed to them and it's it's any
small amount of critical analysis
applied to that tells you that it is
merely spoon feeding nonsense to a
hungry audience that's all it is the
Trump administration is now admitting
that they've lost track of about
percent of the parents of the toddlers
who have been separated from their
parents so kids of all ages have been
separated from their parents at the
border looking specifically at those
five years of age and younger the Trump
administration said during a conference
call with both reporters and a judge
that they are unsure about the
whereabouts of one in five sets of
parents of the toddler's separated and
it's not clear if and when they are
going to be reunited a US District Judge
Dana
Sabra was on this call Friday this is
related to the deadline the
administration was given a deadline of
tomorrow July 10th for reuniting these
separated toddlers with their parents
and originally the Trump administration
said they were gonna meet that deadline
they then backtracked now they're going
to miss the deadline and the new number
is that roughly half of those under five
will hopefully be reunited by tomorrow's
deadline and Alice Olsteen from Talking
Points Memo has been following the court
cases around this and she tweeted as
this was developing the Trump
administration just told a federal judge
that 19 parents of children under five
years old have already been deported
they are arguing that they shouldn't
have to reunite them with their kids the
ACLU is pushing back the kids under five
are in the u.s. at these internment
style detention centers the parents are
gone the parents are no longer in the
country what do you do next
this is a humanitarian crisis it's a
moral crisis it's a legal crisis in the
sense that are there going to be any
repercussions to anybody for not
reuniting these kids with their parents
that's not being discussed also not
being discussed is the financial aspect
here it's not cheap to keep Hiep these
kids after you've deported their parents
why would you do it even if you lack
empathy for the kids or
parents even if you don't have a
compassionate bone in your body what
about the cost of this why not send the
kids back with the parents and it's the
party supposedly a fiscal responsibility
it's the president who campaigned as
Trump did on being fiscally responsible
what is fiscally responsible about this
and of course the truth is fiscal
responsibility is a propaganda line it's
never actually a priority it's something
you say and when we actually get down to
it and we think about going beyond now
just the the child migrant crisis the
blue state subsidized the red states red
states lack infrastructure they lack
education they lack access to health
care because their economies are by and
large not working and without the blue
states like California New York
Connecticut Massachusetts New Jersey
Illinois Minnesota actually is is one
that pays in much more than they get out
federally without those blue states
places like Mississippi and Alabama and
Virginia although Virginia's kind of
purple New Mexico West Virginia Alaska
Indiana a lot of these places would be
screwed full-stop like I don't have to
qualify it in any other way but you know
who does win hugely from these
detentions of the kids of the adults who
ever it's the private detention
companies it's the banks that own huge
interests in those private detention
companies it's a huge score for them and
part of this is immoral policy part of
this is incompetence they've literally
lost track of what's going on and they
are not only unable to get everyone
reunited at this point it's not even
clear it's legally possible because the
parents of some of the kids are gone pat
they're not even in the United States
you're not going to reunite them you're
simply not and I'm curious to see
ultimately what happens with the
deadline and are there any repercussions
the administration already saying well
half of them simply aren't going to be
reunited our goal now is 50% will there
be any consequence to the Trump
administration if you think the answer
might be yes let me know how because
I'm not optimistic about that send me
your thoughts I'm on Twitter at D Pakman
the show is on twitter at david pakman
show we'll take a quick break and be
back after this huge news weekend that I
want to tell you about the david pakman
show at david pakman.com
[Music]
[Music]
the david pakman show at david
pakman.com let's say hi to a few people
actually I'll say more than I will say
thank you to Joseph
Isaiah coos today's new member of the
day also want to say thanks to Mark
Danielson mark has been with us since
2010 eight years of membership that's
two full presidential terms of
membership for mark Danielson thanks to
Joseph thanks to mark join them by
signing up for a membership at WWE
pakman.com you can also become a patron
it's only a dollar a month minimum very
low entry to this what we call what what
they caught mean I didn't come up with
it what is called patreon go to
patreon.com/scishow
ok I I think it's time to not sugarcoat
the problem that we may have called no
voter turnout in November and just kind
of tell it like it is I've been talking
about voting in the midterms we have a
lot of different forms of activism that
we are working on in order to resist the
Trump regime but one of the primary ones
that I've been espousing for a long time
is you've got a vote in November right
there's nothing else if you've been
activated by the election of Trump if
you're horrified by the embarrassment of
the United States's reputation around
the world if you're just concerned about
a particular issue like the possibility
as legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said of
abortion bans in 18 to 20 states over
the next couple of years on the basis of
Donald Trump's soon-to-be announced
Supreme Court pick whatever you're doing
in addition to voting you've got a vote
okay and when we talk about specifically
November of 2018 I've told you about the
historically low turnout in midterm
elections that means your vote
sort of matters even more right if the
turnout is expected to be lower on a
mathematical level your vote matters
even more I've talked about the
importance of voting to interrupt the
Trump agenda we've talked about the
Supreme Court implications I've said
before does
matter what Robert Mulder comes up with
if you have a Republican House and
Senate between 2018 and 2020 or 19 and
21 as it is effectively you're not going
to have consequences to Mulder's
investigation we've talked about that as
well Pat you've got to vote for that
reason yeah in history would tell us
that the Democrats will do well in the
2018 midterms but history also told us
that Hillary Clinton would win the 2016
election exactly right the economy was
relatively strong and Obama was popular
but that didn't happen it did not happen
and fortunately in the middle of 2017 we
had high enthusiasm high engagement in
terms of being engaged and even a few
months ago in April of 2018 several
polls still showed that there was an
enthusiasm gap in favor of Democrats
depending on the poll maybe not quite as
big that enthusiasm gap is rapidly
shrinking and potentially fading and
this is a disaster and I have been doing
whatever I can to explain why you must
vote in November of 2018 I've challenged
this false logically fallacious idea
that because one vote never changes in
elections results it's not worth voting
I won't do that again but I've been
talking about that and I've been
explaining why all of this matters and
over the weekend I got it I got an email
from longtime viewer Stephanie who's
been a great supporter of the show by
the way
for many many years who said hey David I
want to do my part to get people to vote
can I sponsor some half price
memberships for people who are working
on getting people to vote in November
and Stephanie and I went back and forth
and we sort of came to the reality that
in some way it would have to be on the
honor system right like how can we
demonstrate that someone has earned a
half-price membership there's really no
way to do it so here's what we're going
to do okay if you're doing anything to
help take down this right-wing regime in
November you can get a half-price
membership if you want it Stephanie will
pay for half of your membership
memberships are normally 60 bucks for
the year all the member benefits that
you get normally 60 bucks for the year
Stephanie will pay 30 you pay the other
30 just write in and tell me what you're
doing for the midterms if you're phone
banking great if you're helping people
register great if you're just badgering
your friends to vote that's fantastic
and honestly Stephanie
even said with midterm election turnout
so low as I mentioned she said David if
people write in and simply say they're
gonna vote in the midterms and that they
want a half-price membership she's
willing to sponsor that as well so it's
on the honor system if you don't need
the discount and and you would be okay
paying full price don't ask for the
discount the idea is to expand access
and bring more people into what we're
doing for a good cause really a crucial
cause if you want the half-price
membership go to david pakman.com slash
contact tell me what you're doing for
the 2018 midterms and that you want one
of these half-price
Stephani memberships and I'll send you
the coupon code it's the honor system
and Stephanie's okay with that yeah
we're doing everything we can to get
people engaged here yeah our thanks to
Stephanie I love this contest especially
because I think I'm in need of some hope
and yes inspiration and I think this
will provide that to me Pat's gonna get
fourteen hundred half-price memberships
on the basis of I guess his
participation on the show and that
that's that's what Pat's piece is half
price membership just right in david
pakman.com slash contact tell me what
you're doing to help with the November
midterms and I'll send you that coupon
code no limit Stephanie could end up
having to pay for a lot of $30
memberships here because she said she
believes that she can cover as many
memberships as we might get from and all
1,400 of mine too that's us she's in for
many many tens of thousands of dollars
on that basis okay the world's two
biggest economies are the United States
and China the United States and China
are also now in a trade war thanks to
Donald Trump and what I want to prepare
you for is a bunch of the stuff that you
buy regularly getting much more
expensive as you might remember the
Trump administration previously
announced tariffs on China those went
into effect on Friday and there are new
tariffs now on thirty four billion
dollars in Chinese products China
immediately retaliated with thirty four
billion dollars in tariffs on American
products five hundred and forty five
different goods targeted by China long
list beef seafood dairy not concerning
for the vegans I guess but also farm
goods including this is going
beans are actually a big part of what's
going on with the tariffs and vegan Pat
is gonna be very very concerned about
that
cars another tariffed item this isn't
good for American workers the Chinese
people buy a ton of stuff from Nike and
Apple and Starbucks vehicles from
General Motors a lot of the
manufacturing for the American companies
does happen in China but these are in
the end American companies that are
going to be hit so on the one hand
you've got Chinese tariffs on the US
that's going to hurt American workers
then on the other hand American tariffs
on Chinese stuff are going to make
Chinese products more expensive for
American workers this is not good for
American workers Trump promised he was
just going to be great for American
workers and this is just the first 34
billion from Trump we know that there is
potentially another 16 billion
kind of in process and Trump has
threatened as much as 450 billion
dollars in tariffs and I've been ranting
and raving to you about the short-term
impacts of these tariffs for a while you
know them by now the question I'm now
thinking about and I was reading about
over the weekend is how does this end
what's the endgame here Trump claims
that the tariffs are because China is
unfair to the United States on trade and
is stealing intellectual property okay
those are specifics so are you putting
the tariffs in and then negotiating to
fix those problems do Trump's advisors
even agree on what the solution to those
problems would be hint they don't agree
on what the path forward is and just as
sort of like a vignette of what is going
on American businesses that deal in
soybeans for example soybeans are a big
part of how these tariffs are just gonna
be absolutely disastrous soybean farmers
in the US and the Midwest are already
delaying buying equipment and making
investments in their own businesses so
the way it works is Trump tariffs China
China tariffs American soybeans the
American soybean farmer says well I'm
going to delay
there are people who make a mistake and
admit they made a mistake and they move
as quickly as possible in the direction
of fixing the mistake that they made
there are other people who make a
mistake and they double down either
because their ego won't allow them to
admit defeat or because they genuinely
can't change their mind and consider
that they might have actually done
something wrong Donald Trump is in the
latter camp he doesn't admit to making
mistakes he usually does double down
even on the worst mistakes that he's
made and right now one of the biggest
mistakes that Donald Trump has made in
his still early presidency is the trade
war that he has started and Donald Trump
is doubling down and he's doubling down
so hard on this that he started to make
completely wild and wacky claims with no
connection to reality whatsoever the
reality of the tariffs that Donald Trump
has placed on American allies around the
world is that they're going to hurt
American businesses and also American
workers that's the reality trade Wars
are not good or easy to win
despite Donald Trump saying that they're
good and easy to win the tariffs are
gonna make American products more
expensive around the world that's going
to hurt American businesses it'll hurt
workers the tariffs are going to lead to
retaliatory tariffs from our allies that
will make their products more expensive
for us that's also bad for Americans who
aren't necessarily swimming in extra
money with which to purchase foreign
goods and Donald Trump most recently
this is so whacked out has suggested
that the tariffs might be so good for
the United States that the revenue
created by the tariffs could conceivably
make the federal income tax unnecessary
and this is so silly
that it's hard to know whether it even
warrants a response or if it's just an
example of how disconnected this man is
from reality when a play video for you
Trump is saying that the tariffs could
be so good that it could be like when
McKinley was President of the United
States in the late 19th century what the
hell does Donald Trump know about
William McKinley and that the United
States didn't even need income taxes at
the time because just
tariffs can be so good it is completely
perverted logic but it's sort of what
Donald Trump seems to be applying to
this situation take a look 30 percent
tariffs or so tariffs can be a very
positive thing you know the old days
when we had tariffs we didn't have
income tax when people wanted to come in
you look at the days of McKinley and
some others when people wanted to come
in they had to pay a price when they
want to come in and raid our treasury
fair to pay a price we didn't have
income tax you didn't need income tax we
didn't have debt so we're doing this I
will say in every instance every country
any country that you can mention has
been extremely nice so what he's saying
is in previous times when we had tariffs
and no income taxes things worked really
well so therefore his tariffs now are a
good thing now it's just so you have the
data federal spending is a portion of
the total economy is ten times higher
now than it was during the McKinley era
that Donald Trump references so as a
comparison this is totally meaningless
this is the type of math that leads to
bankrupt casinos and it is not that
shocking that the guy who thinks trade
wars are good and easy to win and knows
nothing about taxes and has no clue how
to run a government might think that
maybe if you do really well with the
tariffs you wouldn't even really need
the federal income tax
yeah when McKinley was president we
didn't have Social Security we didn't
have Medicare our military wasn't what
it is now yeah it wasn't what 15
government departments and countless
more agencies well care sustainable
careful because that's the logic they'll
used to say well we got to get rid of
all that stuff
we got a shrink Social Security and
we've got to get rid of a bunch of those
government departments right so you got
to be careful with that logic military
can stay big though both military can
double absolutely we need it much bigger
sometimes I listen to this stuff and I
think back to my high school economics
class there were students in my high
school econ class who seemed to have a
better grasp of these big economic
issues and fundamentals than Donald
Trump has and I want to mention the
McKinley thing the fact that Trump
mentioned President William McKinley who
was president starting in 1890
seven this isn't something Trump is an
expert on if Trump is mentioning William
McKinley it's because somebody told him
mention William McKinley I don't think
anybody at this point believes that
Donald Trump is a casual historian who
knows a lot about President William
McKinley such that he could make this
comparison in this this casual way I
would point to either Stephen Miller or
I don't even know a coke brother or
someone who has Trump seer on this stuff
it's like when Steven Bannon got him
interested in Andrew Jackson exactly man
the comparisons started and didn't
really end this is absolutely ludicrous
it is a gong show a comedy of errors
harebrained idea after harebrained idea
I don't know what analogy or phraseology
you want you want to apply to it but we
are in a period where total ignorance
and saying whatever comes to mind or
whatever somebody said in your ear five
minutes before a camera got turned on is
being accepted as some kind of
truth-telling tough-guy patriotic gospel
I I don't even know what other word to
apply to it and it is stunningly
disturbing Donald Trump gave another one
of these rambling incoherent speeches
that were so bizarre that you couldn't
tell whether the teleprompter switched
to Mandarin in the middle of the speech
or maybe Trump was having some kind of
medical incident because no sensible
explanation came to mind other than
total incompetence and we know that
Donald Trump recognized that the public
relations around caging little kids was
bad who could have guessed right and so
in an attempt to fight back against what
Trump saw his bad publicity about his
immigration policy he put together
people whose family members were
allegedly clip killed by quote criminal
illegal aliens here's a little bit of
Donald Trump's bizarre rambling
incoherent speech we're gathered today
to hear directly from the American
victims of illegal immigration you know
you hear the other side you'd never hear
this side you don't know what's going on
these are the American citizens
permanently separated from their loved
ones the word permanently being the word
that you have to think about permanently
they're not separated for a day or two
days they are permanently separated
because they were killed by criminal
illegal aliens these are the families
the media ignores they don't talk about
them now you might say hey David that's
not deceptive there are illegal
immigrants who killed people and these
are the families of their victims so
what's wrong with that shouldn't we know
if there are criminal illegal aliens and
I would say to you sure that's a problem
we should focus on all people in the US
who commit violent crimes whether
they're here legally or not the problem
is that when you have to stop and think
about why Donald Trump did this rally
and gave the speech the insanity of it
surfaces the bad PR is around the
separation of children from their
families the separation of children from
parents who aren't even breaking laws in
some cases because they're coming to the
border and seeking asylum not entering
the United States illegally and Donald
Trump is pushing back against critics
who say caging kids is bad by saying
some illegal immigrants killed people
he's holding the rally to make people
afraid of dangerous immigrants and then
of course the biggest insanity insanity
of this all is that undocumented
immigrants commit less crime than
native-born Americans we have data from
the libertarian Cato Institute about
criminality in Texas and what you will
see is that native-born Texans commit
crimes including all crimes in general
but also specifically homicide and
larceny at higher rates than both
documented and undocumented immigrants
so if you're holding a rally merely to
warn people about who's dangerous by
crime rate you have to be way more
afraid of in this case native-born
Texans than undocumented people in Texas
one more set of data for you at the
state level higher rates of undocumented
immigrants correlate to a lower crime
rate from 1990 to 2014 the data is clear
we did an entire long-form piece about
this on the truth about illegal
immigration you can find out more about
this issue by checking out that video
last thing on this the economic side
I hate to break it to anybody who's
finding comforts and solace in the
immigrants are bad because they're
taking our jobs thing but if you lost
your job to an immigrant
shouldn't you be blaming the business
owner who took advantage of the
immigrant at your expense to lower their
costs and increase their profits the
people hiring the immigrants are the
ones that are laughing all the way to
the bank because you're mad at the
immigrants instead of them this is
free-market capitalism or at least it's
what I call it Pat is free where we want
it to be free capitalism and I know
we've gone over this before but how can
the immigrants be both lazy welfare
recipients vagabonds who don't want to
work and taking so many jobs that real
Americans like you can no longer fight
find one explain that to me and you'll
never see Republicans blame the business
owners who hire these illegal immigrants
now don't give them a tax cut every once
in a while they will say and we should
also enforce the law when it comes to
businesses that hire undocumented
immigrants but they don't really have
the political will to do it absolutely
immoral what is happening here you can
discuss this with us on our subreddit at
david pakman.com slash re d di t yet
another day and yet another example of a
federal law violation by Donald Trump
targeting a specific company on Twitter
I'm starting to feel as though the
English language is being pushed to its
limits to adequately explain the crisis
level stuff that's going on right now
with this administration Trump is now
threatening Harley Davidson with being
quote taxed like never before if they
move overseas which they're being pushed
to do because of Donald Trump's own
tariffs so I want to break this down
step by step for you Donald Trump
started a trade war he put tariffs on
Chinese European Canadian goods as
predicted the countries that were
tariffed
by Donald Trump decided that they were
going to put in place retaliatory
tariffs this is how trade Wars work
completely unsurprising and as a result
we've had some American companies
harley-davidson being one example
announced that they're going to move
some element of their business over
in Harley Davidsons case they are going
to try to get around tariffs that would
increase the cost of each motorcycle by
2200 s by moving production of their
European market motorcycles out of the
United States so Harley moving that
production overseas is a direct response
to the repercussions of Donald Trump's
trade war when harley-davidson announced
hey this is what we're going to have to
do Donald Trump goes on Twitter and he
threatens Harley with punitive taxation
tweeting yesterday quote a
harley-davidson should never be built in
another country never their employees
and customers are already very angry at
them if they move watch it'll be the
beginning of the end they surrendered
they quit the hora will be gone and they
will be taxed like never before
understand what's happening here Trump
first hurts Harley Davidson by starting
a trade war Harley reacts to save their
revenue and Trump says I will hurt you
even more if you try to get out from
under the destructive effect of the
trade war that I started Trump forced
them to make a business decision and now
he's going to punish them for making
that business decision to try to save
their profits and of course it won't
matter to Trump supporters Trump
supporters will say you know it's
Obama's fault because he was weak on
trade or congressional Democrats
obstructed fixing trade deals so Trump
had to do this and Trump's just gonna
have to be tough in order to make this
right which of course makes no sense
since the whole point of fixing trade
was to be good for American businesses
not so terrible for American businesses
that they say wow we have to save
ourselves and offshore even more jobs
which is exactly what's going on I was
thinking about how the EU targeting
harley-davidson is actually kind of
clever because Harley is seen as this
kind of Heartland American icon and by
putting harley-davidson in a position to
have to make this decision
harley is in a position where
conservatives will have to decide do we
denounce Harley because we're supposed
to see Harley as this American icon but
at the same time if we say we support
what harley-davidson is doing we're kind
of criticizing Donald Trump because we
were admitting that this is what they
have to do because of Trump's trade war
and the real lesson is that trade war a
policy by Trump is half haphazard and
it's also a losers policy Trump can't
win it right we can go into the esoteric
economic details or we can just
understand that in broad strokes Trump
can't win the trade war businesses are
going to suffer middle class Americans
are going to suffer and I don't take
pleasure in this every time we talk
about this Pat people email in and they
say David you anti-american freak you're
pleased by what's going on no first of
all if you say that you must acknowledge
that there are bad things going on
that's number one so why don't you just
criticize the policy as opposed to
criticizing me I don't take pleasure in
400 points wings in the Dow I don't take
pleasure in the exploding of oil prices
that we're now seeing and I certainly
don't take pleasure in this economic
instability I'm just not gonna sugarcoat
it for you I've got to tell you the
truth I thought we were supposed to be
sick and tired of all the winning at
this point in your presidency we're not
really thinking that we're not seeing it
we're not seeing it with Harley Davidson
and I also want to give you another
example of Jack Daniels whiskey that is
really going to suffer under Trump's
trade war another day another racist
faux pas by a Republican that you're
just not allowed to call out because if
you notice their racism you were playing
the race card if you believe that I feel
sorry for you annex Trump advisor went
on Fox News and called the black
Democrat quote out of his cotton-picking
mind of course the term cotton-picking
refers to one in the south of the u.s.
in the late 1700s the early 1800s black
slaves picked cotton Lou Dobbs years ago
once had one of these weird incidents if
Lou Dobbs is before your time I know we
have some younger viewers on the show he
used to be sort of a prominent CNN
anchor who hosted a quote money show and
I think he's now on Fox Business if that
show hasn't been cancelled here's Lou
Dobbs
almost accidentally using the term ten
years ago we're living with the issue of
race we've got to be able to talk about
it and I can guarantee you this not a
single one of these cotton yeah I think
just ridiculous politicians should be
the moderator on the issue of race right
when talking about how great things are
racially he calls politicians referring
in fact to condi rice who happens to be
black in that segment cotton pickin just
cringe so cut to this weekend here is
former Trump advisor David bossy quote
debating or engaging in dialogue with a
black Democratic strategist named Joel
Payne and out-and-out says
cotton-picking take a look here final
point you said that about David David
Michael Michael Hayden posted a picture
of Auschwitz Michael Hayden yeah that
scream you're out of your cotton-picking
mind we're gonna leave it right this is
ridiculous ed Henry panicking saying hey
hey he said you out of your mind
very quickly got out of control
eventually David bossy did apologize for
his choice of words tweeting quote
during a heated segment on Fox & Friends
today I should have chosen my words more
carefully and never used the offensive
phrase that I did I apologize - Joel
Payne Fox News and it's viewer so the
apology is fine most trumpets don't
apologize so even getting an apology is
something but the reality is that the
problem isn't just that he said it it's
that as soon as he's in disagreement
with a black guy
he immediately either consciously or
subconsciously goes to cotton-picking
and the question is why and even wackier
is that the the conversation was about
civility in politics and whether it was
appropriate for Michael Hayden to tweet
a picture of Auschwitz as an analogy to
what's going on with the child
internment camps and as you see on the
screen behind me their own headline for
the thing was the left's racist rants
continued as the guy from the right
calls the black guy on the left out of
his cotton-picking mind could this have
been
at some kind of avant-garde performance
art is it possible that David bossy was
on ambien a time and the ambien maybe
got him to say this wacky thing there
are people defending him online
like imagine this being the hill that
you die on people online are defending
david bossy saying that he's a child of
the 70s and any child of the 70s has
cotton-picking as part of their lexicon
with no racial connotations and it just
comes out reflexively and if that's the
argument my question is why is it that
the incidents in media tend to be white
Republicans using the term
cotton-picking when talking to or about
black people is it another one of those
coincidences yeah and why didn't you
mention that in the apology I it's weird
because whenever I get angry I don't
become a racist I think it could have
been the ambien I do I don't
all of a sudden incorrectly use that
term yeah that's that's the other thing
that always comes up which is well you
apologize for the use but it's clearly
what you automatically go to when you
become frustrated with someone in this
case when you become frustrated with a
black guy who quite frankly was making
him look pretty stupid on Fox News we
have even more fallout from this
harebrained ill-thought-out trade war I
don't personally drink Jack Daniels
whiskey but many people do and in Europe
many people also like Jack Daniels
whiskey and those European customers are
going to have to pay ten percent more
for Jack Daniels whiskey as a direct
result of Donald Trump's trade war the
European Union has placed a number of
retaliatory tariffs against American
products as a result of this trade war
put in place by Donald Trump we've
talked about how harley-davidson is
moving some production out of the United
[Music]
the david pakman show at david
pakman.com it has been a long time since
I've been this disgusted with those
voters who insisted that there was no
difference between Donald Trump and
Hillary Clinton
I'm always disgusted with the Trump
voters that's that's a mainstay that's
nothing new but there were people people
on the Left ostensibly
who said in practical terms there's just
no difference between Trump and Hillary
a vote for Trump a vote for Hillary it's
all the same because whichever one of
them wins doesn't really make a
difference in our lives for our children
for our grandchildren they are both
representatives of maintaining the Toxic
status quo of corporatism and vulture
capitalism and so on and so forth there
was even a movement a movement called
Bernie or bust where lots of people felt
this way Trump and Hillary were both
tools of the corporate political status
quo and if it's not going to be Bernie
it doesn't matter some of them didn't
vote some of them voted third-party some
of them voted for Trump as a sort of
protest vote that idea and I'm not going
after the Bernie er Buster's
specifically here but the idea that
there is no practical consequence to
Hillary versus Trump has blown up in our
faces
yet again as Donald Trump is going to
get to select another Supreme Court
justice because Anthony Kennedy is going
to retire and is going to now by virtue
of this Trump will be able to influence
the future of the United States for at
least a generation including possibly
the repeal of roe v wade but Trump and
Hillary were going to be the same it
didn't matter
which of them won I told you earlier in
the week that the Supreme Court punted
on a couple of key decisions one
involving an anti-gay florist in
Washington State another involving
believe it was redistricting in
and I mentioned you know Anthony Kennedy
is going to turn 82 very soon courts
will sometimes the Supreme Court will
sometimes four go big precedent setting
decisions when there's a justice that's
close to retirement and exactly as
alluded to Anthony Kennedy has announced
he's going to step down from the court
at the end of July and everything that
any sensible progressive holds dear that
the court has influence on is on the
table at this point this is no longer
replacing a conservative justice with
another conservative justice this is
taking a moderate votes Anthony Kennedy
a justice who voted for same-sex
marriage who has voted for access to
abortions for affirmative action he is
out and he is going to be replaced with
a vile conservative ideologue the reason
we know that is because that's what
Donald Trump said Donald Trump said
before he was even elected what his
philosophy would be for appointing
justices to the Supreme Court and once
Trump selects one of those conservative
justices from whatever list he's working
off of at this point it will be one of
the most massively pro-corporate Supreme
Court's in history could be the end of
roe v-- wade could be the end to the
federal right to abortion and you will
see many states ban abortion altogether
Jeffrey Toobin has talked about this I
don't think we're gonna get to it today
but maybe tomorrow we can talk about
that and once this happens you're
talking about a return to the dark ages
and I think it is really important not
to be hyperbolic we are very careful Pat
to not make analogies to Nazism when
there is not really an analogy to be
made it's important to say to not say
this is the worst it's ever been if
that's not actually true we don't want
to be hyperbolic but what we are seeing
here is a decided move backwards away
from the tenets of modern Western
democracies and Donald Trump's selection
of an extreme lunatic religious right
ideal likely religious right ideologue
is going to be part of that yeah this is
really bad instead of having four
liberal justices and four conservative
justice with a mod
in the middle yeah now you're gonna have
a five-to-four conservative stronghold
the only thing worse I think is if you
know Ruth Bader Ginsburg or Stephen
Breyer or to retire or I'll go on to be
morbid but yeah I think that would be
the only thing that would you know
surpass this right what will surpass how
bad this is is when Trump gets a third
pick right that's basically what the
silver lining is there's more damage to
be done and the primary blame for this
is actual Trump supporters but behind
them are the people who didn't think
there was enough of a difference between
Trump and Hillary to justify getting out
to the polls in November of 2016 and
unless the Senate flips in November and
unless we get Trump out in 2020 unless
the next democratic administration
whenever it happens we don't know when
that'll be
puts together a serious and concerted
court packing plan the right has
co-opted of the Supreme Court
potentially for decades the untold
damage that Donald Trump is gonna do to
this country beyond his own life right
like now Donald Trump is setting in
stone damage to the United States of
America that will extend beyond his own
lifetime I hope that the Democrats in
the Senate are ready to put up a fight I
don't know if they are I wonder whether
Supreme Court justice Jeanine Pirro come
forth come I honestly I know it sounds
absolutely ridiculous I know Jeanine
Pirro wasn't on the Heritage Foundation
list of approved names for Trump but I
would not at this point put it past him
to consider not literally Jeanine Pirro
but something as ludicrous and
cartoonish he floated the idea of
putting Judge Napolitano on the Supreme
Court and he's another Fox News guy so
it's not outside of the realm of
possibility and if you're waiting for
Democrats to grow a backbone on this
I'll remind you that they may not and
even if they did they may not be able to
do anything because Neil Gorsuch is only
on the court because Republicans refused
to hold hearings for Merrick garland
during President Obama's last term in
office they said well we're only a year
from the presidential election we want
the voters to have a say before we make
hugely significant consequential
decisions about the Supreme Court and
Republicans won and Democrats I believe
need to play hardball there are just a
few months left until the midterm
elections why would we have confirmation
hearings for a Supreme Court justice
when in a few months
Democrats could take over the House and
Senate and completely change the caliber
and tone of American politics for the
two years that will follow
I implore Democrats to say and do
anything they can to prevent this from
going forward before the midterms
because if you replace Anthony Kennedy
with a hardcore conservative you know
what happens John Roberts becomes your
swing vote John Roberts is no moderate
and he becomes the swing vote when you
replace Anthony Kennedy with an
extraordinarily ideological right-wing
conservative what do Dems do hate to
warn you but most likely the next to
retire is going to be Ruth Bader
Ginsburg then you're talking about an
even bigger conservative majority and
elections matter whether you're a Bernie
or buster or a Trump and Hillary are the
same or my vote doesn't matter so I
don't vote whatever right you are a part
of the problem in addition to of course
the massive problem of 60 plus million
people voting for Donald Trump which is
the primary problem you're the root of
the problem if you're at rumpus you
didn't help if you thought Trump and
Hillary would have been the same and
I've been debating whether or not to
talk about this Pat we talked about it a
little bit in the studio yesterday I've
never been one of these people who says
I'll move to Canada um partially because
I know it's hard to move to Canada but
whatever the proverbial I'll move to
Canada the authoritarian slide the
attacks on press freedom what we are
going to see as out-and-out abortion
bans in many states after Trump makes
this change on the Supreme Court I've
started to think about what options I
have yeah and at least you have some
options right you go to Israel go to
Argentina maybe I've been Poland I don't
have any of those you're lucky in that
yeah if anybody can help Pat with a
place to go if anybody can offer Pat a
passport somewhere so that he would have
an option please write in and let me
know it's gonna get really really bad in
the United States activists have started
protesting Donald Trump staffers and
cabinet members I told you last week
about Department of Homeland Security
Secretary Kerstin Nielsen who
was heckled at a Mexican restaurant by
protesters later active it not later the
same day but later in the week earlier
this week more protesters showed up at
her house and had speakers playing audio
of migrant children crying at the border
as they were being separated from their
parents trump's completely loony advisor
Stephen Miller was heckled at a
different Mexican restaurant Sara
Huckabee Sanders was asked to leave a
restaurant in Virginia this is not
violence of any kind this is legal and
still there are people who have a
problem with it even Pat actually has
said that he sort of has a problem with
it as he said earlier this week there
are people saying we must be activists
but we must at all times remain
completely civil I want to give you a
little context about that idea Cooney
professor and historian Angus Johnston
found some articles from the New York
Times from 1934 okay and the articles
were by a Quaker named Henry Cadbury
and Henry Cadbury didn't like the
conflict that was taking place between
Jews and Nazis so he wrote an article
urging goodwill by Jews for the Nazis
and the argument that was being made at
the time was that the resistance of the
Nazis by Jews is just going to make
things even worse for everyone folks
know just know this is not going to work
Trump is about to appoint a Supreme
Court justice that could repeal roe v
wade and set off a chain reaction of up
to 20 states that will ban abortion
period this is not the time for signing
petitions posting flyers
and making phone calls this is the time
for action and I'm not saying violence
someone called in last week and said hey
David what do you think about an Tifa
burning down the child internment camps
as a form of protest and I said well no
first of all there would be kids inside
why would you burn down the place with
the kids if we're trying to protect the
kids but I'm not saying violence I am
saying the shaming and the taking up a
notch
of these public embarrassment campaigns
of these individuals when people and our
basic societal institutions are under
attack expressing outrage is the right
thing to do and making the people
responsible for carrying the policies
out uncomfortable is your duty never
mind
something that is acceptable don't do it
in a counterproductive way right if 20
years from now though the atour the the
authoritarian slide has become
institutionalized legal authoritarianism
and abortion is banned and same-sex
marriage is somehow repealed and
corporate power is given even more of a
foothold as a result of the Supreme
Court are you going to be satisfied that
you called up your representative and
you said hey message for Elizabeth
Warren's office please oppose Donald
Trump's nominee is that going to be
enough for you to feel like you did
everything you could I know that I
wouldn't Pat and I know that there are
many people in the audience who wouldn't
feel like they did enough either and the
problem is that in many societies
violence is allowed only top down those
in power can inflict violence on others
law enforcement at the border the
Supreme Court on women by banning
abortion or whatever other policy soon
as it goes the other way it's a big
problem I mean there's an example look
at what the forces of power did about
some football players silently kneeling
during the national anthem so we know
that top-down political violence is
acceptable as soon as you try to reverse
it things get real very very quickly so
the understanding that we have to have
is that there might be arrests and there
might be trouble and it's going to come
down to how willing are we to fight for
what we know is right remember when we
were saying that the Democrats should
shut down the Senate until Merrick
garland gets confirmed that didn't
happen and this is why it matters
because now Trump got Yael Gorsuch and
now Trump gets to replace Anthony
Kennedy and this is why the calls for
civility from those in power who have a
lot to lose if people realize how
outraged they should actually be are
hypocritical and they should be ignored
and there's a choice to make
okay we can say I'll live my life I'll
try to take a vacation when I can afford
it I'll go to the movies I'll play a
video game I'll read a book I'll learn
the ins and outs of vegan cooking
whatever right and wait for it to go
away before you know it what might have
gone away are not the problems but the
foundations of our society that you take
for granted while you sit there and read
your book if that book is even even
still allowed right because that's also
not a guarantee if you're with me let's
work together to figure out how to fight
this stuff we've got to do more than
just write letters to members of
Congress I applaud the people who are
coming up with new ideas who have been
reaching out to me and in the mat
background you've got to support
independent media right because there is
a three-pronged attack on independent
progressive media and if we don't
survive I don't know what we'll have
left because you're not gonna have
corporate media and you're barely gonna
have the internet with the net
neutrality repeal let's brainstorm
together what we can do I'm on Twitter
at depatment we'll take a quick break
and be back after this the david pakman

effectively a constitutional crisis and
a crisis of separation of powers that
we're dealing with we've got to support

crisis that our country is in and we're
willing to do more to try to push back
against it ww join pakman.com ok we've
got nearly 7,000 of our viewers and
listeners now regularly participating on
our subreddit a subreddit is like a
discussion forum except instead of
living on our website it's on Reddit you
can access it by going to david
pakman.com slash re d di t some
interesting discussions that started in
the last couple of days that i noticed
this morning that i want to point to
here is one I emphatically support
David's opinion regarding people shaming
Trump cabinet members non-violently in
public settings the only thing necessary
for evil to triumph is for good men to
do nothing voting them out takes time
protest is what we can do now are you
feeling Pat at all influenced by what
has happened in the last 48 hours to say
you know what maybe the public shame
campaigns are a good thing well to be
clear I'm all for protesting I'm all for
being aggressive I just
don't think that we should intimidate
people harass people you know deny them
service go to people's homes I think
there's a middle ground between these
two positions if would your mind be
changed if an elected official was
advocating for the death penalty without
trial of political opponents would it
then be okay to go to people's houses
and play sound of kids crying and bother
them at restaurants yeah I mean I like
the sounds of kids crying I think that's
an effective strategy to protest but I
guess I mean is would you feel
differently if you felt that the problem
was more serious if there could be a
place where the Trump administration is
doing something that goes too far right
and then it would maybe it's a matter of
drawing a line so in reality you
actually aren't opposed to the tactics
you just don't think it's gotten bad
enough to warrant the tactics at this
time I'll go with that for now Wow that
may be even scarier prepare for a flood
of hate mail for producer Patrick Ford
or maybe people agreeing with him maybe
people agree with that okay also from
the David Pakman show subreddit YouTube
introduces channel memberships
merchandise and premieres yeah we are
part of the YouTube sponsor beta and
what YouTube has determined is that they
are going to keep YouTube's sponsorship
but they're gonna rename it as a channel
membership so it's gonna be the exact
same thing if you currently are a
YouTube sponsor for $4.99 a month you
will just be grandfathered in to the
channel membership program I people
already started emailing me Pat saying
wait I became a youtube sponsor now
YouTube sponsorship is getting canceled
and I've got to sign up for this other
thing called the channel membership and
the answer is no no it is the same thing
it's just a name change that's all so
don't worry too much about it
also from the david pakman show
subreddit if you could travel back in
time to post World War 1 Germany and
your mission was to stop fascism from
rising how would you do it you know very
often people say I'd kill Hitler but I
have a different approach what about
just taking Hitler and putting him in a
particularly because the focus is on not
using violence as the thread starter
since bonus points for not using
violence put Hitler in a more nurturing
environment which would probably have
prevented him from doing what he
ultimately did get him into that
school he was rejected from that's exact
or sophistries that's exactly right and
sometimes we have this idea of history
as this we look back at history as if
this was the only and inevitable course
just by sheer math if you think about
three of the major sort of dictators of
the 20th century in Mao Hitler and
Mussolini there's a 50/50 chance of a
child being born a woman versus being
born a man roughly speaking it's not
exactly 50/50 but it's close enough that
means that the odds of Mao Hitler and
Mussolini all being born men is about
12.5% that means that there was an 80
7.5 percent chance that one of those
live stream it's been a while it's been
a while we are going to talk about the
retirement of Supreme Court Justice
Anthony Kennedy I will take questions we
will do a whole bunch of stuff I don't
even know when the last time I did a
live stream was I was doing I'm pretty
frequently for a while and then I don't
know just interest kind of waned I
thought and why do it if people aren't
interested but I'm back I'm back and
we're gonna do it we're gonna do the
thing so we will I'll get to people's
questions and we're we've got plenty of
time today plenty of time to discuss and
it's actually kind of a horrible day
politically I'll talk about the
implications of Anthony Kennedy and it's
bad I try to put a positive spin on
everything when possible it's hard to
put a positive spin on the Anthony
Kennedy retirement but we'll see if
maybe we can find something not
completely disastrous about it I don't
know if this is your first live stream
and for many of you it may be because
it's been a while since I've done live
streams number one these are really live
unlike the clips that we upload these
are actually live unless you're watching
this an archived video on a replay I
will take your questions the best way
we've toyed around with different ways
to take questions during these the the
normal chat goes by really quickly so I
will remind you that you can use super
chat to send questions or to make
comments I will read them I will answer
I will react to them also any new
members and patrons who sign up during
the live streams you get a shout out
from me I'll sing your praises I will
say great things about you they may not
be true but I will I will say them
anyway and please don't troll the live
chat okay we do have moderators obvious
trolling is gonna get you banned I will
do it the moderators will do it somebody
will do it
and number five become a sponsor and we
are part of the YouTube sponsorship beta
this will also make it so that when you
type in normal chats they will look
differently so
they would look different if I type a
test you see that David Pakman show
looks different in the chat YouTube
sponsors also are identified highlighted
in the regular chat
I see Lise Hamilton already asking very
negative questions the David Pakman show
lose subscribers no we didn't we've got
four hundred and seventy five thousand
now which is more than more than ever
before and very quickly going to five
hundred thousand okay so we will get the
questions I will get to all of that
stuff sooner than later but we've got to
start by talking about what's going on
with Justice Anthony Kennedy we got the
quite frankly very bad news today that
Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy is
going to be retiring and you know the
the the primary reason why this is bad
is because Donald Trump now gets to
choose a replacement and Anthony Kennedy
has been a moderate vote on the Supreme
Court Anthony Kennedy has voted in favor
of marriage equality he has been a voice
in favor of legal abortion and it is not
in any way overstating the impact of
Anthony Kennedy's retirement and
inevitable replacement with a truly
ideological hardcore right-wing
conservative justice that roe v-- wade
is now in question
gay rights could they be in question
well along the religious freedom lines
gay rights could be in question that
this is really really bad and it's
particularly upsetting to me because I
was getting messages from people on the
left during the 2016 election saying
David it doesn't matter whether it's
Trump or Hillary it makes no difference
whether it's Trump or Hillary because
they're both status quo elected official
types it doesn't make a difference one
way or the other who you vote for
and some people on the Left didn't vote
at all as a result some people on the
left
third party in states where the results
were not a guarantee and they insisted
Trump Hillary doesn't matter burn it all
down and now we have to deal with the
real consequences that by picking Neil
Gorsuch which by the way shouldn't even
have been a selection right I mean
Merrick garland should have been
confirmed this idea that in the last
year you just don't do anything if it's
under Obama you want to give people a
chance to vote it's ridiculous but they
did it and they won and now Donald Trump
gets to select a replacement for Anthony
Kennedy and this will have an impact
beyond Donald Trump's lifetime unless he
ends up living to 200 like that doctor
said he could if he just improved his
diet a little bit Hillary Clinton would
not be even considering replacing
Anthony Kennedy with somebody somebody
who might vote to overturn roe v-- wade
for somebody who might become or will
become a stalwart and steadfast right
wing voice on the Supreme Court so I'm
particularly sickened thinking back to
the Bernie ER Buster's who were
insisting that there simply is no point
in voting for Hillary or Trump that
they're both throwaway votes because
they are votes for the status quo could
not be further from the truth could not
be further from the truth and we are now
going to have to deal with that and it
is sickening and if anybody is not
sickened then you're not paying
attention because this is going to be a
win for corporations
we know that the Supreme Court
historically sides more often with
corporations than with individuals when
you have cases that involve corporate
power versus individual power that's
going to get worse we know that the
Supreme Court will often err on the side
of allowing bad things to be done to
individuals by corporations unless there
are very clear-cut cases where that
needs to be changed and that is going to
get even worse under whoever it is that
Donald Trump is select so this is a
disaster is there any silver lining is
there any way in which this is not as
bad as it could be I I don't know
I'm having trouble thinking of a way I'm
having trouble imagining how this could
possibly be worse because you are going
to have in Donald Trump a president who
is completely unqualified and lacks
knowledge even on the most basics of
economics trade geopolitics social
issues I mean really it's hard to think
of someone who knows less and he is now
going to get the opportunity to select a
second Supreme Court justice and Ruth
Bader Ginsburg would probably be the
next to retire and it may happen during
Donald Trump's first term I think that
it's possible Trump gets reelected we've
talked about that on the program
extensively very likely becomes
overwhelmingly likely that Trump would
get three or maybe even a fourth Supreme
Court pick if he is re-elected so what
we can count on is here's like
impossible sort of silver lining on this
maybe Trump's replacement of Anthony
Kennedy with a just vial right winger
will inspire people to vote them out in
November and I've been increasingly
concerned that in because of hyper
normalization initially when Trump was
elected you had interest very high from
the left the marches the activism
everything and because we're now used to
five scandals a week interest has sort
of slowly been waning and I am
extraordinarily worried that even though
Democrats have an opportunity to take
over the house in November have an
opportunity to take over the Senate in
November I am skeptical that it's going
to happen and by saying this what you
should read from it is not well let's
forget about November it's I've got to
make sure to vote I've got to make sure
to get people registered to vote that is
the one and only path forward and I just
can't even imagine it's hard to even
understand the magnitude particularly if
Donald Trump chooses someone who's
younger someone in their early 50s even
potentially somebody in their 40s to
replace
Anthony Kennedy you are talking about an
impact on our country that will last
potentially a generation or longer and I
people know that I am NOT one of these
I'm gonna move to Canada types first of
all I understand that it's really
difficult to move to Canada as much as
we might sometimes like to I have never
participated in the if exile moved to
Canada if Bush is reelected I'll move to
Canada or any of that stuff I've just
not done it but I would be lying if I
didn't tell you that over the last
several weeks I have started to have
real sort of thoughts about not I'm
gonna in protest move right I'm it
wouldn't be a protest thing but I start
thinking about we've got the sort of
suggestion from Trump of skipping the
Constitution when it comes to
undocumented immigrants we've got this
decidedly authoritarian move you've got
a guy who is deliberately seemingly
deliberately or at least recklessly
ruining relationships with longtime
American allies I have started to think
about well what would it be like if for
some period of time I moved somewhere
else my options basically are Argentina
and Israel right though those are my two
options I think I've told the story
before of how my family because my
family left Poland shortly before World
War two we would hypothetically be able
to get polish passports which confer EU
privileges but because the birth
certificate of my polish grandfather was
misplaced during World War two that's a
difficult thing it's actually a
conversation I'm having with people I'm
having a cut the conversation with
people in my life I'm having the
conversation with with friends and
family because that's actually how bad
it is getting and I know that there are
people in the audience also who are not
in the let's move to Canada thing who
are just genuinely horrified by what it
is that's going on and the Supreme Court
thing is going to be an absolute and
total disaster there is no other way
around it and I hate to break it to you
because since day one of
Trump administration I have been sort of
optimistic that now that people get it
now that people understand the magnitude
of these elections that support of
independent media has escalated and that
was true for a while after Trump's
election shows like mine and others that
are similar to mine that have presences
on YouTube and other social media we've
seen an increase in financial
contributors we've seen an increase in
traffic it's all just been going way way
up D monetization hit on YouTube
we had another massive wave massive
massive wave of supporters that came in
the rallies the activism it was
abundantly clear why this was a time to
be active and in April last month in May
our support has started to wane a little
bit a lot of those people that signed up
four year memberships in April and May
of 2017 have been choosing not to renew
them in May of 2018
I've spoken to other hosts that I'm sure
you know but because they didn't say you
can mention my name I'm not going to
mention their names other hosts are
seeing the same thing some of the
support that we gained early in the
Trump presidency has started to fade and
I believe that there is a hyper
normalization that's going on people get
accustomed to the fact that there are
scandals every day essentially every
week if not every day people are getting
accustomed to the authoritarian slide
and this is how authoritative really
takes hold which is not from one day to
the next with media attacks it's the
development of the term fake news
singling out individual media outlets
talking about requiring journalism
licenses whatever that would even mean
starting to talk about other ways to
suppress critical voices in media and
over time people become desensitized to
this concerted attack on a free press
which is one of the institutions of the
United States of America that actually
serves as a check and balance when it
works appropriately not when it's
co-opted by corporate interests against
government power
people are forgetting and I talked about
it earlier on in the program we've seen
our patreon numbers I'm sure you've
noticed trickling down we have seen what
was initially a big upswing and the
number of YouTube sponsors the level out
and start to trickle other shows are
experiencing it and we're gonna do
everything we can to be bigger than ever
but I am concerned about because what I
went when you don't see progressive
independent media supported that makes
me think that interest in voting in
November is also not going to be there
that makes me think that activating
against the Trump administration is
going to start waning so I'm concerned I
am I'm significantly concerned about
what is going on and I'm obviously I
hope that I'm wrong right I hope that
that this is some kind of temporary
thing I hope that it is just a brief
problem that shows like ours are
experiencing but everybody's saying the
exact same thing and that is
extraordinarily concerning to me let me
get to some of the super chats and
different things that are going on as a
reminder if this this is my first live
stream in a while if this is your first
live stream there really live unless
you're watching a replay if you have
questions for me I try to follow the the
chat but it is hard because it moves
pretty quickly
use super chat to send comments and ask
questions and I will get to them I will
get to them if you are so kind as to
sign up for a membership or make a
pledge on patreon while we are doing the
stream then I will give you a shout out
and sing your praises and that will be a
really good thing and please don't troll
the chat I'm saying that there is some
trolling going on there's a couple
people who have already been banned and
that that's just don't do it it's not
funny and it's not fun and it's sad that
people waste their time trolling and
lastly we are now part of the YouTube
sponsorship beta so that is something
else that you can do if you want to
support our work ok Steve Braun sent a
$5 super chat as you can see up there
asking what do you think about Acacio
being a democratic social the essay and
that the DSA identifies as
anti-capitalist well listen I am for
social democracy right I've been very
clear that I am NOT a socialist I
have no problem debunking failed talking
points about socialism but I've been
very clear that what I think is the best
system is one that allows for the
rewards of innovation and
entrepreneurship because I believe
incredibly strongly that
entrepreneurship is a driving force of
innovation in Western democracies but I
believe that in exchange for that system
and the ability to do entrepreneurship
and build successful businesses we need
to it is a moral imperative and it is an
economic imperative to have very
well-funded social safety nets so that's
where I come down I am I am in favor of
social democracy means you can build a
really big business and you can be very
successful if that's your thing but at
the same time if it's not regardless of
what job you choose to have regardless
even if you choose not to have a job we
should be providing health care we
should be ensuring that education is
strong so on and so forth okay so that
that's my view and I think it people by
and large know that that I am NOT a
socialist I don't really I'm not
concerned in any way that Alexandria
Ocasio courts has identifies as part of
DSA as a democratic socialist the truth
is that the United States is not at it
even remote risk of becoming a socialist
nation and to the extent that a
Democratic Socialist can lobby for
stronger social welfare programs and a
safety net I think it's absolutely
fantastic there is too much lack of
diversity Democrats and Republicans
exist within a pretty narrow scope in
the House and Senate yes you've got
Republicans increasingly extreme but you
have very few true progressive leftists
that our elected officials and I though
I'm not a democratic socialist myself I
am NOT concerned whatsoever I think it's
a great thing and I look forward to
seeing what if indeed she wins the
general election would Alexandria Acacio
Cortes does now my caveat is and I'm not
afraid to say this and she's welcome on
the program any time and we can talk
policy I have not been hugely impressed
by her ability to go deep on policy okay
so I know
that she has run on a number of
different she has a number of different
positions medicare-for-all abolishing
ice right so I've seen the list of
positions I've not been dramatically
impressed with her ability to go into
depth about lots of those issues and I
welcome the opportunity to be proven
wrong and she's welcome on my program
absolutely any time okay another super
chap that came in from Ninh Jack's ex
David give me your straight opinion how
bad is Justice Kennedy's announcement
what would that I opened the livestream
with that it's really bad
it's really bad and I can't think of how
to sugarcoat it but it is
extraordinarily bad the timing could not
be worse Donald Trump could end up with
three or maybe even four picks for the
Supreme Court by the time that it's all
said and done and it is absolutely
atrocious this is a guy who has been the
quote moderate vote and he has voted the
right way a number of times he voted the
right way on banning state-level bans on
same-sex marriage he has been a defender
of at least some access to abortion
services for women and what you will
basically see once Kennedy is replaced
with a lunatic religious right ideologue
what you're going to see is John Roberts
become the swing vote and that is the
stuff of nightmares I mean absolutely
totally stuff of nightmares another
super chat from sinister minister who
says the next American Civil War begins
with Trump yeah I saw a poll today which
said something along the lines of some
crazy percentage of the country
predicted civil war or even wanted it I
don't I don't remember exactly I
bookmarked it to look at for tomorrow it
was I'm not I'm not going to predict
Civil War but the country you know we
always hear the country is as divided as
ever this feels like a slightly
different type of division I'm not
saying it's the worst it's ever been or
it's not as bad as it's ever been what
I'm saying is there's a different tone
tenner to the division that we're seeing
right now I hope that there is no such
Civil War but I think that the division
is of a different type than what we've
seen for a while rich Parata sent a $5
super chat thank you rich saying if
Democrats take over the House Senate and
presidency what's the chance of
establishing term limits for the House
Senate and Supreme Court almost nothing
rich almost nothing I've talked about
how I would actually be in favor of term
limits for the House Senate and the
Supreme Court there are different
reasons why I think it makes sense for
the House and Senate and why it makes
sense for the Supreme Court the overlap
being that lifetime appointments and the
ability to be re-elected and definitely
do impact the accountability that people
have and I know that you often hear well
we don't want if you can if judges are
I'm joined today by Jason Payne who's
the founder and CEO of Aida diamonds
which is a custom fine jeweler that
works exclusively with lab-grown
diamonds Jason diamonds are a topic I've
been interested in for a very very long
time I am hostile to the diamond
industry in many ways for what I see as
an immoral marketing decision to
increase the market price of diamonds
connected to very very few families
around the world as you know and I am
eagerly waiting for something to
dislodge what I see as the artificially
high price of diamonds I would love for
you to tell me that your lab-grown
diamonds are going to be that thing
although I know that it's actually not
not quite so simple so maybe let's start
a little more broadly why lab-grown
diamonds to begin with so what's
misunderstood about the laboratory-grown
diamond industry is that the entire
purpose the industry is not to make what
you think of as diamonds it's not to
make gemstones out of diamonds it's to
make high-end technological applications
of diamond so that's everything from
surgical knives to water purification
tools to semiconductors and even quantum
computers and so what I'll argue is that
an investment or a purchase of a piece
of jewelry with laboratory-grown
diamonds is directly funding the
research and development of all these
fascinating applications of functional
diamonds that will help people around
the world for decades to come
so is that is is that kind of how the
diamond industry is bifurcated which is
gemstone diamonds and then all other
diamonds for sort of like non jewelry
applications correct okay now if you
Raul if you're relying decades or
centuries all of those diamonds were
coming out of the earth and there were
industrial quality diamonds and there
were gemstone quality diamonds so the
industrial ones were the small brownish
diamonds that were used for cutting
tools during World War Two and beyond
and today there's really
three categories of diamond there's the
industrial diamond
there's the functional diamonds and
there's the gemstone diamonds how do you
grow a diamond in a lab it's one of the
most arduous and difficult processes
that humanity has ever harnessed and it
takes an immense amount of pressure and
heat and an incredibly high degree of
precision to pressure-cook carbon into
diamond so the best way that I can
describe it is that we are taking
graphite and heating it to about 1,500
degrees Celsius and turn it into liquid
carbon and pressurizing that carbon to
over a million psi or 70,000 atmospheres
worth of pressure and at that high of
temperature as we cool it down from
liquid back to a solid form the solid
form is my favorite form of carbon a
diamond basically were ya know creating
McCann I was gonna say merely were
recreating conditions underneath the
earth where carbon becomes diamonds so
to the layperson if you were to see a
gem a natural gemstone diamond that
would be used in jewelry and one of your
lab grown diamonds whose purpose would
be an industrial application for example
would the layperson notice a difference
between the two a a layperson would not
frankly nor would a gemologist so with
all of the standard tools that a
gemologist uses there's no way to
decipher the difference between a
diamonds whose origin is underneath the
earth and a diamonds whose origin is
above the earth why they're both a
diamond they're both crystals of carbon
so one of the things we do with our
clientele is that we've got two diamonds
of very similar quality ones the
laboratory-grown diamond and one is a
mined diamonds and we show the clients
the two diamonds without telling them
which is mine and which is
laboratory-grown and the clients cannot
tell the difference between the two that
is fascinating that is fascinating
now I'd love to maybe get your
now understanding a few sort of more
general elements about this industry and
this is this is like I said something of
significant personal curiosity you go
and you buy a gem diamond natural
diamond and it might cost five thousand
dollars for example yes you immediately
go to the store next door and you say
you would like to sell that diamond and
of course as exists in any business that
has overhead and is trading in the
buying and selling of something you will
be offered only a fraction of that five
thousand dollars and then immediately
the diamond you bought for five thousand
and maybe let go for twenty five hundred
will be sold by the new buyer for forty
five hundred dollars or maybe even the
full five thousand is there any
explanation for that other than that
this is a very concerted effort to deal
in incomplete information with the
public or in other words are there any
actual economic reasons other than this
we have to make up for our overhead why
the value of one particular diamond
would fluctuate sold so wildly within
transactions there is an economic reason
and the reason for that is that diamond
is a complete outlier compared to any
other economic good in the sense that it
has the exact same utility today as it
does 50 years from now
so a refrigerator a car radio that was
purchased 50 years ago has little to no
utility today correct whereas a diamond
there's really no way to tell if it was
mined a century ago or ten days ago and
so it's an interesting phenomenon that
the generations of diamonds that have
been sold the success of the diamond is
forever campaign after world war two
those diamonds are now being
reintroduced to the supply in a
significant quantity and that is having
a dramatic effect on the price of
diamonds but really to answer your
question directly is that diamond is
such an outlier in that it's forever and
so it has the same utility forever
regardless of when it was mined or grown
how is that different and I
ask not rhetorically nor sarcastically
but how is that different from for
example sapphire so it is not different
from other gemstones but it is different
from other consumer products so what I
just said about diamonds I think you
could apply to most gemstones out there
and then how about gold what about gold
because gold although gold is gold and
and sort of some of that same logic
would apply Gold can take different
forms you can have gold as a backing for
paper currency or not and there's sort
of some variations how might we
conceptually think about the difference
between Dimond and gold yeah so gold is
a fungible asset in the sense that you
can melt it down you can repurpose it
you can blend it with other metals like
we do for making fine jewelry you can
purify it to a hundred percent pure gold
to make Boyan diamonds are interesting
and that each individual gemstone is an
individual SKU they have specific
characteristics that are different stone
to stone and so there's a reason that
gold has been a financial I'll say
financial instrument but a unit of
Finance for many decades to centuries
whereas diamond really has never been
viewed or utilized in that way something
that we focus on is using recycled gold
recycled platinum in the jewelry that we
create we pay a premium for metals that
are refined here in the United States
because of all the sort of negative
environmental consequences or
externalities that can be present in
mining of fresh or new gold let's talk a
little bit about that right so with
regard to diamonds there's this term
conflict diamonds conflict-free diamonds
it seems to me again as a layperson that
one of the great benefits of a lab-grown
diamond if not that it is going to be
less expensive which you've already
pointed out that that that's not really
the selling point of the lab-grown
diamond right is that you can
definitively know that no little kid
might have
drowned or whatever it is that that
could happen having obtained a
particular diamond you can say that
definitively and from the research that
I've done even some of the diamonds that
are sort of marketed as conflict-free by
retailers they don't really know that
that they're basically going on somebody
else's say-so is that not a major
opportunity of the lab-grown diamond
which I which I know you know you talk
about industrial applications rather
than gemstones is that not a big
opportunity uh I think that that I think
it's a wonderful feature of
laboratory-grown diamonds that I as a
retailer can tell you not only where the
diamond was grown but quite literally
who is the technician or the PhD who is
running the diamond press that actually
grew that stone right um so I think
that's that transparency and that
ability to get all the way back as far
as possible in the supply chain is a
huge selling point or feature of
laboratory-grown diamonds um I do want
to clarify the Kimberley process is now
well known by many of your viewers or
readers but that the Kimberley process
is limited to one small aspect of the
supply chain of diamonds and that's
ensuring that there are no civil wars or
civil conflicts or insurgents that are
funded by those diamonds so today as it
stands the Kimberley plot process does
not cover other aspects of potential
human suffering or misery in the supply
chain of diamonds it's only focused on
insurgency civil war and conflict so in
other words if I understand correctly
even a diamond if correctly labeled as
conflict-free tells you nothing about
whether there are little kids involved
in the mining or the working conditions
it's merely a sort of evaluation of the
political circumstances around the diet
of the mining yes that's correct
that being said there are multiple
efforts ongoing today to bring
blockchain technology to diamond mining
and to scan the diamonds as far upstream
as possible and then have the pedigree
of the diamonds tracked all the way
through cutting and basically going from
the mine to
market for ore mines diamonds and that's
something that I fully support and
applaud and hope that that is a
successful utilization of blockchain to
ensure that there are no a conflict or
problematic diamonds that end up in the
supply chain going forward so we as
humans are getting increasingly close to
being able to harness the natural
resources from celestial bodies and I
don't mean planets but asteroids for
example what happens and I would love
for you to tell me the truth about this
because I'm so curious about it and I
have no reason to doubt that you will is
the diamond industry scared of the day
where we find an asteroid that has more
diamonds on it than the entire supply of
diamonds on earth first let me talk
about the existence of what I'll call
super terrestrial diamonds yes without a
doubt there are asteroids as well as
planets in our solar system that likely
have iceberg sized diamonds floating and
seas of carbon on those celestial bodies
I love it so there are NASA scientists
that believe Neptune and Uranus may have
very large size diamonds present on the
surface of the planet so first off I do
think that is a very real possibility
and I do believe that the mining of
asteroids is something that will be
important for the continued growth of
the human race frankly I think the
bigger concern for the diamond mining
industry is diamonds running out on the
serta near the surface of the earth
versus a celestial body being a new
source of diamonds and what I mean by
that is that since the untick WA T the
human race has pulled about 6 billion
carats of diamonds out of the earth and
I've pulled the public filings of the
largest diamond mining companies in the
world there's about one point four
billion carats of diamonds in reserve
and similar to Peak Oil we're well past
peak diamond and it's really a matter of
20 50 years before the known resources
of diamonds on the surface of the earth
are depleted and it's no longer viable
to extract diamonds out of the earth so
what happens then I guess is the
question barring being able to harness
these extraterrestrial diamonds for lack
of a better term does that drive the
cost of diamonds up even further when
it's basically you've got to buy a
diamond from someone else because
there's no new diamonds being found I
think in the short to medium term it's
actually to have the opposite effect and
that prices of diamonds are going to
fall and the reason for that is we have
to go all the way back to World War two
so during World War two there's a huge
need for diamond grit for industrial war
efforts both the Axis powers and the
Allies really focused on finding and
sourcing diamonds for their efforts it
was a key part of the industrial
revolution that happened around World
War two so in the years immediately past
World War two you saw a four-fold
increase in diamond mining and that grew
significantly in the decades to follow
and so what's happened is it's really
baby boomers are the first generation of
time where the majority of Brides
received a diamond for an engagement
ring and so for the first time really in
humanity the generational passing of
diamonds in a large capacity is starting
to happen and that will mean hundreds of
millions of diamonds of used diamonds
will be coming back on the market in the
decades ahead and that may even in some
years outstrip the supply that comes out
of the earth and if that's to be the
case big increase in supply not a huge
increase in demand will see the price of
diamonds fall in my opinion absolutely
fascinating Jason Payne is the founder
and CEO of aided diamonds they work
exclusively with lab
diamonds Jason I really appreciate you
talking to me it's a pleasure
I want to keep talking about trade for
now though we've been talking a ton
about this trade fiasco that's been
caused by Donald Trump and it's actually
a problem with many of our allies but
right now it's acutely a problem with
Canada and most of our conversations are
either about trade sort of generally
we've talked about the sources of the
tariffs that actually exists between the
United States and Canada some of the
Canadian tariffs on US products are a
response to either US tariffs or US
subsidies as I spoke about with the
dairy industry we've talked about the
trade balance that something Donald
Trump also really likes to talk about
we've also explored Donald Trump's
general and competence on trade but one
thing we haven't talked about yet is
another way in which the entire thing
can blow up in Donald Trump's pee face
which it's likely to do and that's
called boycotts
a Canadian boycott of both American
products and of traveling to the United
States has started slowly but especially
over the last ten to 14 days is building
more and more there's another movement
that is focused specifically on
encouraging a Canadian 's not to travel
to the United States to cancel their
planned travel to the United States and
many Canadians are actually doing it and
there are Canadian websites that provide
information to Canadians about whether
products are made in the United States
or not so that Canadians can if they
want to opt for the non American
products and when I tell you about this
I know that I'm gonna get right-wing
nuts
emailing me saying David go back to
Argentina or Israel or wherever it is
you're from and stop taking pleasure in
the boycotting of American businesses
and I'm not reporting it to you because
I'm taking pleasure in it I'm reporting
it to you because it pains me and I want
to stop it we we need to have a total
stop to the ruining of our ji'er
geopolitical relationships by Donald
Trump this isn't fun and games right
jobs depend on what Trump tweets and his
harebrained ideas people's livelihoods
depend on the actions of the president
and I hate
to break it to you but it's not just
Canadian tourists that are bailing on
traveling to the United States we told
you in January of 2018 about travel data
from 2017 to the United States and a lot
of countries are drastically reducing
their travel to the United States the
u.s. can manage without it's not going
to end the United in the United States
economy but jobs are going to be lost
and it won't be good for the economy the
data for 2017 was that 4.6 billion
dollars and about 40,000 jobs were lost
as a result of other countries citizens
reducing their tourism to the United
States much of that attributed of course
to the presidency of Donald Trump and I
hate the boycotts the boycotts are bad
for friends of mine who own businesses
they're bad for people I don't even know
I mean can you imagine I can actually
empathize with people that I don't even
know and it's bad for them but this
could be an effective way to state to
take a stand if people do it we know
that bookings in Trump's hotels even
Trump branded hotels not owned by Trump
but where the name is licensed to Trump
have been taking a hit I have family
very anecdotally in Argentina that is
specifically saying you know we usually
go to the US every two or three years
we're due for that but we're not gonna
go we're gonna go elsewhere because we
simply don't want to go when Donald
Trump is President of the United States
if you're wondering whether Trump even
cares I kind of doubt it I kind of doubt
it and it's yet another way in which he
said he was gonna look out for the
little guy he said he was gonna look out
for the middle man oh the middle class
but it's just not happening and so far
it doesn't actually seem like his
supporters are punishing him for it and
that's the scariest thing in the context
of the upcoming midterm elections and
I'm going to talk about that a little
bit later in the program
join the discussion with more than 6,000
of our viewers and listeners on our
subreddit trade a big topic of
discussion there as well as Paul
Manafort going to jail and lots of the
other things we discussed on today's
show david pakman.com slash re d di t is
where you find
subreddit quick break new-and-improved
shorter breaks on the David Pakman show
coming up next welcome to the program
joining you from very very sunny very
hot Northampton Massachusetts today we
have not only indictments now but also
jailings of Trump staff in the Trump
Russia investigation and it's not going
away and it's not ending anytime soon
former Trump campaign manager Paul
Manafort has been sent to jail and Paul
Manafort you might recall was previously
indicted released on bail I told you
last week he was re-indict 'add for
witness tampering charges he was
contacting people apparently via text
voice and also encrypted message and
trying to influence what they were going
to be telling investigators and he has
been charged and a judge has now sent
him to jail judge Amy Berman Jackson
said quote this isn't middle school I
can't take away his cell phone if I tell
him not to call 56 witnesses will he
call the 57 and he is now in jail and
we're gonna get to Donald Trump's
reaction in a moment but I do want to
remind you that all along we were told
nothing will ever come of this right
there's nothing to look into there will
be no charges
there will be no indictments there will
be certainly nobody going to jail or to
prison and of course pretrial detention
which is what Paul Manafort finds
himself in at this point is not prison
in the sense of a sentence but it is
somebody being held in jail because they
simply weren't able to just behave like
an adult and follow simple instructions
from the judge which include don't start
contacting witnesses and potential
witnesses and influencing their
testimony which is exactly what he did
Trump immediately both defending man
affort with logical fallacies but also
part of the idea is to distance from
mana for and we'll get to that in a
little bit Donald Trump saying it's
wrong to send Paul Manafort to jail
because he has worked for other
presidents and actually in one tweet
which I'm going to show you Donald Trump
it's amazing I know that now there's 280
characters in in a tweet instead of 140
Trump has four glaring errors including
multiple logical fallacies in just one
tweet Trump tweeting Wow
what a tough sentence for Paul Manafort
who has represented Ronald Reagan Bob
Dole and many other top political people
and campaigns didn't know manna for was
the head of the mob and what about and
he says what about Comey
and crooked Hillary and all of the
others very unfair so let's break this
down piece by piece because it's
actually in a sense it's remarkable that
he's able to insert so much nonsense
into one tweet first of all Trump says
that this is a sentence for Paul
Manafort men afford hasn't been
sentenced to anything right men afford
is being held pretrial because of his
behavior and a judge's decision to call
this a sentence confirms I was going to
say demonstrates but it actually
confirms the fundamental total lack of
understanding of the American justice
system that Donald Trump has secondly
Trump says that this is wrong to do to
Paul Manafort because manna for worked
for Ronald Reagan that's an ad hominem
genetic fallacy and you might think well
David ad hominem is when you insult
someone instead of dealing with the
argument ad hominem just means to the
man right it means that it's it could be
a positive or negative statement about
an individual in this case it happens to
be positive but it's the same fallacy as
saying oxygen is bad because Hitler
breathed oxygen right that it's kind of
a silly example here it's manna fort is
good and too good for jail because he
once worked for Ronald Reagan and of
course that's totally fallacious
logically next logical fallacy is Trump
says I didn't know manna for it was the
head of the mob that is a straw man
fallacy right rather than saying why
it's wrong to send manna for it to jail
for the actual reasons manna Ford is
being sent to jail Trump is defending
manna for it by saying this guy's not a
mob boss which is not an argument
anybody made for sending pom anaphoric
to jail and then lastly logical fallacy
number three and this one tweet Trump
says what about Comey and crooked
Hillary right the idea is why is man
afford being held pretrial if neither
James Comey nor Hillary Clinton are in
jail nor prism prison and that's classic
what about ISM right James Comey and
Hillary Clinton haven't been indicted
for anything and in any case even if
they had been indicted that wouldn't
have any bearing on whether the right
decision for Paul Manafort is to hold
him pretrial because he's now accused in
a second series of indictments of
tampering with witnesses and it's also
just a really Doug dumb argument in this
case because in general people who
haven't been charged with crimes don't
get sent to jail right like that's just
it's kind of a dumb argument that
doesn't even make sense at its face and
meanwhile so that on the one hand
there's this ludicrous and laughable
defense of Paul Manafort who's now in
jail at the same time much like with
Michael Cohen the Trump attempt to
distance the campaign from their own
campaign chairman continue Trump said
during this bizarre pseudo press
conference outside of the White House
that quote manna fort has nothing to do
with our campaign there's two analyses
there one is that trumps using the
present tense right when he says manna
Ford has nothing to do with our campaign
that's technically true because manna
Ford is not currently involved with
trump's reelection campaign he's in jail
so obviously he's not currently involved
with Trump's campaign but it's a
distortion right because manna fort was
Trump's campaign chairman Menna fort ran
Donald Trump's delegate strategy which
was a big piece of how he ended up
winning by initially starting to pick up
delegates here and there during the
Republican primary and don't forget that
when it comes to Russia manna fort was
the guy who was pushing the Republican
Party to harden their stance against
Ukraine and to soften their stance on
Russia which they did right before the
the Republican National Convention in
summer of 2016 so the distancing is
totally transparent and bogus and a
really funny side note most media
outlets when Paul Manafort was sent to
jail correctly reported the
headline which is Paul Manafort sent to
jail that that's correct right Paul
Manafort jailed whatever you whatever
phrasing you want to use for at least a
while Fox News was reporting this as
Manafort pleads not guilty to witness
tampering which is accurate but it is
not at all the most relevant and
newsworthy part of the story then
relevant and newsworthy part is not only
has this guy been adult indicted
multiple times he can't even keep it
together enough while out on bail to
stay out of jail and the next thing I
want to talk with you about is the
insanity of the reactions to Paul
Manafort being sent to jail including by
Alan Dershowitz who has completely
jumped the shark over the last year and
a half there is a whole new world out
there of ways to make money online and
I'm not even talking about out and out
scams I mean just ways to make money as
someone who gives their opinion about
things on the internet on YouTube I
often get emails from people saying hey
David you know you could make a lot more
money if you took this position or that
position or if you called out this
person or that one or that idea or this
idea and I even once had a lunch meeting
with a major talk radio person I don't
want to say who it is but it's someone
from the talk radio industry
who said to me you know David if you
could double your income by pretending
to be a conservative instead of a
progressive would you do it and I said
no of course I wouldn't do that and they
said something like it's good to know
what your principles are so you know how
you want to direct your career or
something like that and nevertheless I
never had lunch with that person again
after that meeting but regardless
fortunately our show is doing well
enough that I don't need to do that
right nor would my moral compass even
allow me to concoct some kind of fake
personality or set of positions that's
not my authentic self but there are lots
of ways now that clearly are great
moneymakers and yesterday we were
talking in studio about some of them and
some of them are obvious right like
becoming a conspiracy theorist the
theories themselves don't so much matter
but the thing about conspiracy theories
is that while they won't appeal to a
huge portion of the on
or the online media audience the people
that buy into your conspiracies will
give you money because they'll see you
as having some kind of courage to tell
the truth about whatever you're talking
about so conspiracy theories are a
really big moneymaker that's one but
there's better ways another really great
way to get people to pour money into
your patreon page or whatever else get
you speaking gigs get you invited on to
other shows is to have an awakening
right you have a political awakening and
it mostly works if you go from being
progressive to conservative in some way
because when a conservative has an
awakening and becomes progressive
progressives don't see it as a miracle
we just say yeah it's common sense they
just figured out how the world works so
if you're willing to denounce your
progressivism and concoct some reason
why you're now in the conservative side
because you've seen the light that is
really good for business and you can
make a ton of money doing that and this
will get people to celebrate you as
someone who's willing to admit mistakes
and is now copping to the ultimate truth
really really profitable Pat's taking
notes on that one cuz he's interested in
that one you can also get a ton of
attention and sort of bolster your
rhetorical credentials by setting up
false debates with artificially narrow
parameters to come off as having owned
people or taken them to school on some
issue and it's even more effective if
the people are completely unskilled and
lack any experience in actual political
rhetoric so that you look really good in
alpha you'll kill it and you will
attract the ton of attention for
yourself and that's actually a good one
in general even if you're not setting up
artificially narrow debates often with
false questions just debate people who
are totally unqualified to be debating
right you will look really good in
comparison another way that you can open
the floodgates of Internet cash give
blindingly obvious advice that you'd
normally find in those discounted
self-help books that you can get for a
penny at the local use book store on
Amazon but wrap up the obvious advice in
either intellectual sounding language or
make the advice seen
counterculture or controversial in some
way if you can hint that people are
trying to suppress your ideas because
they're dangerous or they present some
kind of ultimate truth you'll make that
much more money and if none of these
idea sounds good to you a goldmine is to
provide pseudo scientific arguments to
legitimize discriminatory and
prejudicial ideas and if you can say
that actually these are the ultimate
truths that the politically correct
crowd won't admit you can retire early
on that one and race an IQ is one that
comes to mind along those lines and then
last thing if you want just a quick tip
if you're looking to become a successful
online pundit fight against identity
politics while using your own identity
right argue that identity politics is a
terrible malignancy on society and that
white Christian men are being
disenfranchised by identity politics and
that it's time to finally stand up for
white Christian men prepare for patreon
to explode if you're willing to do that
if I'm missing any let me know because I
want to help the audience make a lot of
money on YouTube as pundits I don't plan
on doing any of this stuff but these are
just some tips for people who might be
looking for ideas I think the political
reawakening one would work best for me
because I already have a platform on a
progressive show right so I'll be
leaving here shortly and you can expect
my Prager u videos to come out in a few
weeks can you imagine if there was a big
announcement where pat has seen the
light and he is denouncing his
progressive credentials and is going to
basically you ever you could actually
say you were rejoining your family's
conservatism because you've talked about
having a more conservative family and
that would I mean you would be booked by
all sorts of right-wing leaning talking
conferences and also libertarian ones it
would be a goldmine for you I'd make a
new show it would be the path
perspective or the Ford file I'd have to
think of something I like the Ford file
Ford Ford file for freedom that would be
the way or F cubed is actually that yeah
you could do it you could have shirts
that are just an F with a number three
as in cubed send me your thoughts if I'm
missing any ways to make money on
YouTube giving giving your opinion I'm
on Twitter at D Pakman and the show is
on Twitter at David Pakman show I love
this store
Homeland Security Secretary Kristin
Nielsen was shouted out of a Mexican
restaurant last night by protesters who
were confronting her over the separation
from parents and the internment camps of
children I don't know how else to say it
it's the separation and the internment
of the children that the people were
protesting and the story is
exponentially better because it was a
Mexican restaurant although in reality
the facts of the story aren't
drastically different whether it's a
Mexican restaurant or an Italian
restaurant or a French restaurant all
three of those types of restaurants rely
disproportionately on immigrants from
Latin America but there's something
about it being a Mexican restaurant that
makes it that much better for me and it
was a restaurant called M xdc cocina
mexicana in Washington DC and one person
wrote to me saying that they went to a
Mexican restaurant specifically to
trigger protests the idea that this was
some well thought out idea from Kristin
Nielsen and her staff to go to a Mexican
restaurant to trigger protests so that
then they could maybe try to say we
agree with the emotions expressed by the
protesters or something like that I
don't think it's that well thought out
and we have video Nielsen seems to keep
her eyes down on her phone while the
protesting is going on shouts of shame
and if kids don't eat in peace you don't
eat in peace and it was all captured on
video check it out
[Music]
tens of thousands of people who come
people often ask me what have been my
favorite interviews on the David Pakman
show we've done over a thousand
interviews with something like seven or
eight hundred guests on the program one
that stands out is when I was in able to
interview one of my favorite science
fiction writers Joe Haldeman and I
interviewed Joe Haldeman in part about
his book the forever war which is a book
that is sort of analogous with the
Vietnam War it is the 50th anniversary
of the Vietnam War or at least of 1968
which was arguably the war's worst year
and we are going to go back today to
what is still one of my favorite
interviews that I've done sci-fi author
Joe Haldeman from September of 2014
let's check it out we are joined today
by Joe Haldeman who is a Vietnam veteran
and a science fiction writer whose
best-known work may be the forever war
his newest novel is work done for hire
and as some of our viewers may recall
I've recommended both the forever war
and forever peace to you Joe it's such a
pleasure to have you on thank you so
much for doing this
always glad to do it thanks so let's
talk a little bit first about the
forever war because this was the first
book you you I read of yours
it's from the 1970s how direct and overt
were the kind of allusions to the
Vietnam War that may come from your
personal history in that book was that
deliberate or was it more of just the
natural way that it went I would lean
toward natural rather than deliberate I
mean it was the war that I was in so of
course it provides a lot of the angles
and details and so forth and when you
when you think about the term forever
war in the book of course the reason
that the war goes on for so long is
related to the kind of logistics of time
travel and time dilation but was that
the way it felt with the Vietnam War as
someone who who was in the nitty-gritty
of what was going on I'd have to say
that it wasn't really like that I felt
as if the war wasn't going on forever
but the people
who weren't involved in the war didn't
seem to worry much about it and you know
those of us who were fighting or
recovering from it it was the central
fact of our existence and yet America
didn't seem to think it was that
important at the time
is that the way it felt in other words
we've heard this from others we even
we've even heard from people like John
Kerry who have talked about what it felt
like the perception was from those who
were stateside you felt as though it
just wasn't really being paid attention
to buy them by mainstream America well
in fact the attention was mostly of a
negative kind yeah you know and partly
it's a baby killer a kind of
exaggeration Shannon and the definite
division in the United States between
people who are in favor of the war and
people who both against the war and
against any war including yours truly I
mean I was drafted against my will and
went off to fight somebody else's war
when you put together when you start
working on a book like the forever war
or forever peace when I've spoken to
nonfiction authors they're very very
clear that they have the full story they
have essentially a fully formed outline
or skeleton of what there's their book
will be before they even start writing
it does it work that way with this genre
that you write in or is it a very
different type of process for me it's
different I I do know writers of fiction
who outline to a fare-thee-well you know
they might have 50 pages of outline
before they start writing for myself I
like to get the writing going and let
the story generate itself as it grows
there are all kinds of ways to write a
novel and that's only one that's the one
that works for me are the kind of tech
elements and futuristic technologies and
the like are those often the catalysts
for the story or do you kind of conceive
the story first and then you flesh out
the sci-fi elements that are a part of
it well I've gone both ways actually the
one I'm doing now Phobos means fear
actually came from an article in
new scientists a little article about
six column inches and I thought holy cow
I've got to use that but more often it's
the other way around
and where do you find that your ideas
about these hypothetical technologies
come from in other words are they are
they rooted maybe in an actual science
article you may have read or do you feel
that you kind of conceived them from the
ground up well I guess you'd have to say
they're rooted in my background my
education is in science or other than
literature and you know I I see the
world as a scientist does I think an
objective kind of way so my stories are
colored by that viewpoint as I told my
audience earlier on today's program I
recently finished reading forever peace
and that's a book that was written
sometime before drone warfare as we now
are very aware of it if we're paying
attention to the news is being described
to us when you wrote that I guess I'm
not even sure how to ask this question
when you now hear about what's going on
with drone warfare and I don't want to
give too much away about the book for
people who haven't read it did you have
that in mind are you surprised by the
way drone warfare has now become so
prevalent I was a little surprised at
how accurate my predictions were I mean
I'm a science fiction writer I don't
write as a prophet you know if that
future I described had not come to pass
it would still be a valid view of the
future I mean it's a matter of dumb luck
actually I seem to have projected
predicted how the future was going to
come about but I really didn't expect
that while I was writing it I was just
writing a story and it needed drone
warfare which didn't have a name at the
time I don't think it's very interesting
to me that one of the main issues that
now is being discussed around drone
warfare is this disconnection from the
operator of the drone to the reality on
the ground and through through imaginary
technological means and forever peace
you at least to some extent maybe not to
the plight of the victim
but at least to the idea of being there
you figured out a way to connect the the
drone operator the machine operator to
what's going on on the ground when you
think about modern drone warfare is is
that a concern to you this idea that
there's this physical disconnection that
may make these these incursions almost
video game-like
well there's an element of that of
course now when I was an engineer
attached to the infantry in Vietnam my
main weapon was a radio a radio
telephone with which I could call in
airstrikes and artillery support because
I was in a very small unit just sort of
wandering around in the jungle the woods
in our case and drawing fire from the
enemy and our main weapon was the radio
telephone I so in that way of course
it's a little bit futuristic although to
be honest I first ran into it in records
of world war ii so it was old when I was
born actually when you think about your
early writing when you go back and pick
up and maybe I don't know if you even do
this but if you are too kind of page
through the forever war
are you still satisfied with it do you
what are your reactions to your earlier
work and you know when I go back and
look at a program I did only five years
ago
I'm incredibly self-critical of what was
going on either I didn't make the point
the way I wanted to or I missed key
details or whatever the case may be
what's it like to go back and look at
something you wrote 30 years ago you
know for one thing you have to I'm I'm
charitable with other writers when I
read else's work I said okay he's doing
the best he can right well yeah best way
look at my old work I would write it
much differently now of course I would I
hope I continued learning about writing
but in fact that guy that guy was
writing 40 years ago what could he know
about what is the rapid distance feature
now as I say I have sympathy for the one
I the person I was for two years ago but
we don't feel the same way about many
things that's fair maybe when I look
back at my old shows
just say that's the best I could do at
the time with the experience and the
skills that I had that's exactly it in
fact trying to evaluate your own
creativity it's kind of a fool's game
anyhow because basically your success is
not based on your evaluation of it it's
based on the other people people paid to
read and watch your stuff so you know
you do the best you can then you move on
and do something else the next day for
our television and radio audience we
will pause there and go to a break we
will stay with Joe Haldeman and we will
have more the complete interview on our
youtube channel to talk for a second
about not so much being charitable or
not or criticizing your past work but in
looking at your writing style one of my
favorite authors is john lecarre and one
of his earlier works is the spy who came
in from the cold and that's almost a 50
year old book at this point and he and
he's written a book every couple of
years for more or less the last 40 or 50
years and while the themes of his
writing have changed significantly going
from the Cold War to kind of more modern
maybe a radical Islam etc I can't really
identify significant ways in which his
style has changed over a pretty long
period of time do you think your style
of writing has changed over the last 40
years I know it has I'm a I have been a
writing teacher as well as a writer and
I can be a little bit objective about my
own production and I can tell I made
mistakes 40 years ago that I would not
make now now I'm making mistakes now
that I don't see I know that's true it's
true of every writer but they're not the
same Long's I have a watch the sort of
reaction to my work and as you
I've taken some yeah I don't like being
criticized nobody has what I listen to
it and I try to improve my current
writing from the comments other people
made for from my earlier work are there
particular science fiction writers that
you either read or followed or not
necessarily modeled your work
after but who was it that you really
liked reading when I was a kid I really
loved Robert Heinlein and oh let me see
James Blish and Alfred Bester was a big
one
Arthur Clark of course Harry Harrison
Isaac Asimov all the old guys you know
when I was a kid I ate them up and I
suppose the reason I don't eat them up
now is I guess I become too overexposed
and too sophisticated
I do read some science fiction every now
and then but I don't try to keep up with
it I mean a thousand books a year Jesus
you wouldn't be able to do anything else
have you kept up with it that's
interesting you know I talked to a lot
of people who seem to not whether it's
television radio or books they don't
follow their particular genre or area
very closely and I find this even
applying to me in other words the the
reading I do to prepare for my program
which is mostly news in politics of
course relates to that but my personal
reading so to speak has very little to
do I wonder if there's something about a
thinking about her putting energy into
areas that are unrelated from your work
that in some way kind of helps you
within your own field well I do think it
helps me I I have seen in other people's
writing a kind of a mutual appreciation
society I see people who are influenced
by the same people who influence for me
so I can't claim to be yeah sometime I
am you into this but I I think that you
should watch it you should watch for
repetition in your work you should watch
for influences that maybe were better
left with the previous artists I don't
know what the thing is trying to talk
talking about your own writing is is
foolish and and dangerous of course
talking about other people's writing can
be even worse because people might
suspect your motives this way oh he's
getting paid too much
don't read him yeah I have one question
that I
came up with when reading forever peace
which is in the book you mention a
character reading The Long Goodbye by
Raymond Chandler and that Raymond
Chandler is one of my favorite authors
and The Long Goodbye among his work one
of my favorite books was that of
particular significance to you or was
there any hidden meaning to one of your
characters reading that book you know
the hidden meaning is not hidden at all
to me because I happened to read that
novel while I was writing the book mmm
yes I just put it in there I he's a
great model of course for anybody who
likes masculine fiction not just not
just your honor fiction so yeah my
printer is making strange noises are you
picking them up no and I assure you I'm
not controlling it in any way so it's
not it's not me by any means I think
it's coming from my wife's computer
about 200 yards away so Joe last thing I
want to touch on is art you mentioned
what you're working on now your latest
work is work done for hire can you tell
us anything about what you're working on
today
well what I'm working on today is a
novel called Phobos means fear and it's
a hard SF novel hard science fiction
that is to say the level of science and
it is it's pretty high the main
character is a scientist and she's going
through a sort of late midlife crisis
she's in her 60s and does feel somewhat
it's strange from younger scientists so
in a way it's kind of autobiographical I
think most novelists can't get away from
that trap are there ever days where you
just don't feel like writing at all very
rarely you know in rap in fact it's
quite the contrary
I don't enjoy writing every day but I
certainly don't like days when I don't
write when I'm on vacation supposed to
be having fun I'm going yeah where's my
word processor I should I'm supposed to
be doing something here no question
we've been speaking with Vietnam veteran
Joe Haldeman
fiction writer the forever war forever
peace the newest novel is work done for
hire Joe really a pleasure to speak with
you thank you so much for being on thank
you for having me David
just one day after calling kim
jeong-hoon
smart funny and a great person Donald
Trump is so upset with Canadian Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau that he's now
going to be punishing the people of
Canada Trump was interviewed by George
Stephanopoulos in the this was the same
interview we'll talk about later where
Trump ascribed to himself one of the
greatest human memories of all time
which was why he didn't need to take any
notes during that meeting with Kim
jong-un during the same interview Trump
said that he is just so displeased with
Justin Trudeau's recent press conference
that he is going to make it cost a lot
of money for the people of Canada he
learned you can't do that you can't do
that said Trump speaking about Justin
Trudeau we have simultaneously direct
threats to the people of one of our
great allies Canada and compliments all
around for a brutal dictator Kim jong-un
who has his own family members murdered
in cold blood what does this do for the
prospects of renegotiating NAFTA which
Trump has campaigned on it's not gonna
help what does this do for Trump
standing for Trump sort of position
within the g7 which was already pretty
touch-and-go doesn't help and it's not
even totally clear what set Trump off
about the Trudeau press conference
Trudeau has been critical of the steel
and aluminum tariffs he said that Canada
isn't gonna be pushed around by Trump
but that's not an insult right it's it's
just saying we are a country and we can
make decisions and we're not going to be
pushed around it's notable only if the
assumption is Trump should be expected
to be allowed to push anybody who he
wants to push around around and I was
talking to some Canadian friends who
said yeah listen I don't agree with what
is being said by Donald Trump here but
this is great for Justin Trudeau and I
looked into the approval ratings for
Trudeau and as of just a couple of
months ago Justin Trudeau's party had
only a 44% approval which for Trump
would be a record high but for Trudeau
is actually quite low and Trump
attacking Trudeau and threatening
Canadians is actually a gift to
Trudeau's reelection chance
and I don't know if that's actually
welcomed by Trudeau or now I don't know
if he's aware of it but he has now set
up Justin Trudeau to not give an inch on
trade deals and to have Canadians still
support him and doing it right
if Trump hadn't attacked Trudeau and the
Canadian people Trudeau would actually
take some flak for resisting
renegotiating a trade deal or signing a
trade deal or whatever Canadians now are
gonna stand behind the guy even if in
the short term he makes decisions that
might not be the best decisions for
Canada Canadians are going to be
increasingly willing to say you know
what Trump went after him Trump went
after us and we stand behind Justin
Trudeau holding firm here because we
don't want him to be pushed around I
don't know what the future is of
Canadian US relations but what I do know
is that the contrast between how Trump
is treating Kim jong-un and treating
Justin Trudeau is unimaginable would
have been unimaginable a year ago two to
three years ago and I think that this is
probably a good thing for Trudeau yeah
my sense is that this will certainly
backfire on Trump because Canadians seem
a lot more liberal than us here in the
United States and what Trump is really
saying is that Trudeau doesn't care
about his own people so much because
he's going to let them be victims of a
trade war sure contrast that to what he
said about Kim jong-un at the summit
which is that Kim loves his own people
you can't really make that argument when
the guy has gulags his killing his own
people the guy who's killing his own
family members
forcing famine and starvation upon his
own people and running one of the most
brutal totalitarian regimes according to
trump loves his people but Justin
Trudeau apparently is indifferent to the
Canadian people because he quote
insulted Trump
I guess merely by saying he's not going
to be pushed around this is a new era of
American diplomacy even though you can't
really call it that and geopolitics and
consider once again right this is what I
keep going back to the contrast between
our relationship with Canada and North
Korea Canada has teams in our sports
leagues North Korea sent otto warmbier
back to us in a coma
and Trump is friendlier over the last
week with Kim jong-un than he is with
Justin Trudeau Trudeau might actually
get more respect from Trump if he
decided to start developing nukes
forcing starvation upon the Canadian
people and having his uncle murdered or
something like that because that's what
Kim jong-un has done and it's getting
compliments for Trump it is the era of
the United States of America embracing
North Korea and Russia and Turkey while
seemingly deliberately ruining our
relationships with the European Union
and Canada and Mexico I guess this is
what they meant by Trump would be an
unconventional president or something is
that what we can say yeah it just seems
like he's taking all these positive
relationships with Canada with it you
for granted which you can never do right
you can never lay off the gas I think
Trump aswer argue though that you have
to keep your friends close and your
enemies closer that's apparently what
he's doing now they would argue that now
because it can be used to defend what
Trump is doing they would not have
argued that under Obama or under
Democratic presidents that's for sure
send me your thoughts and my question is
and this is not a rhetorical question
what the hell is going on that's my
question I'm on Twitter at D Pakman the
show is on Twitter at David Pakman show
and I look forward to hearing from you
with with some analysis as to how to
interpret what we're seeing at this time
I have both exciting and sad news and
it's the same news and it really depends
on your perspective
Sarah Huckabee Sanders Donald Trump's
latest press secretary is going to be
leaving the administration by the end of
the year not the most vile member as
I've said before just because she lies
constantly but because she seems to
truly relish her belligerent lying and
manipulation of the press corps and
she's one of the most visible members of
the Trump administration and she's going
to be quitting according to a CBS News
report that by the end of the year
Sarah Huckabee Sanders will be gone and
this is a major blow to Donald Trump
first of all it's a major blow because
she's one of the main liars in his
administration one of the most public
facing distorter --zz for this
administration is Sarah Huckabee Sanders
and
she's there to try to sort of soften
Trump's public missteps but this is also
big news because it's yet another major
staffer quitting and you might say well
David that's no big deal
Sarah Huckabee Sanders leaves they'll
just promote deputy press secretary Raj
Shah to the secretary position
unfortunately Raj Shah is also going to
be quitting according to that same CBS
news report he hasn't picked an exact
date but he will also be going bye-bye
this is the continued implosion of the
Trump administration and Sarah Huckabee
Sanders she actually didn't negate the
truth of the report she just said she
hasn't said anything like that she
tweeted yesterday after the CBS story
broke quote the CBS News know something
I don't about my plans in my future I
was at my daughter's year-end
kindergarten event and they ran a story
about my plans to leave the White House
without even talking to me I love my job
and am honored to work for the President
of the United States nothing in that is
a denial right she's not denying that
she's quitting she's simply saying she
hasn't been asked about it for the
report arguably they didn't need to
because she probably blabbed to so many
people at the White House that she's
leaving that it got leaked to CBS and
then they're reporting on it it's
possible that she's quitting because she
realized that her non-stop public lying
is both immoral and not good for the
country I don't think it's particularly
likely I think that it's something she's
just sick of the schedule or it's time
for her to move on I know she has at
least one young kid maybe two I don't
think it's any kind of grand realization
that she's been participating in the
takedown of American ethics for months
by her participation here I think she's
just sick of it he just realizes it's
time to go but it would be surprised if
she decided to stick around for a
January in February of 2019 yeah just
despite CBS to call them fake news who
will take the job that's a question I
have right because this is really a
position that has not been great for the
people that have done it Sean Spicer
his first day on the job the day Donald
Trump was inaugurated Sean Spicer
embarrassing himself by going out there
and lying about it was the biggest
inauguration crowd ever and it wasn't
he left Sarah Huckabee Sanders came in
she was able to pick up smoothly when
she took over for Sean Spicer and I was
thinking that she lies so much we can't
even trust her to tell the truth about
her quitting right she could be walking
across the White House lawn carrying
boxes of her stuff and she might say
fake news as a real problem and reports
have been misleading like she we can't
actually trust her to tell us the truth
about whether she's going to be quitting
or not we're just gonna have to wait and
see yeah I remember Sean Spicer strategy
was always apologetics and making the
story about him right messing up so
badly at the job that he took the focus
off of Trump for a second Sarah Huckabee
Sanders more obfuscation yeah not
answering questions so I don't know who
the new press secretary will be but I'm
sure we'll grow to love them too I would
love to actually see Sean Hannity become
the press secretary because Owens or
Candace Owens yes that would actually be
even more interesting and the most
interesting thing here is not about
another major staffer quitting that's to
be expected it's been an administration
that has a real problem with that for me
it's the role of the press secretary
right I understand that the job of press
secretary is you've got to put the best
possible spin on what the White House is
doing you make everything seem planned
and sober and well-thought-out
if you're defending an administration's
agenda and that's your job there will be
some distortion there will be some
debunk talking points but Sarah Huckabee
Sanders is sort of a special case for me
in that she has this ability to brazenly
and proactively cover up what Trump has
done and said through demonstrable lies
and deception she should be ashamed of
herself
based on her participation in this the
way I hope Sean Spicer is neither of
them realistically is actually
embarrassed by their behavior but this
is an administration that has set such a
low bar for press secretaries that I
hope that the I was just following
orders I was just doing my job excuse
will not be allowed to excuse their
behavior in the future because it has
set a truly new low standard it's a
pond-scum standard for what has been a
position that yes they do get involved
in the talking points and the rep
tition but not in this brazen and
proactive way send me your thoughts
david pakman.com slash re d di t quick
break back after this let's talk about
what's going on in Canada and in
Singapore before flying to Singapore for
today / tomorrow depending on which time
zone we're thinking of today / tomorrow
summit with North Korean leader Kim
jong-un Donald Trump stopped in Canada
for a g7 meeting it was previously the
g8 Russia of course no longer part of it
so it's the g7 Trump wants Russia back
in we'll talk about that separately
every aspect of Donald Trump's presence
was an embarrassment to the United
States there's really no other way to
say it trump showed up late he insulted
a variety of world leaders and left
early later sending subsequent insulting
tweets one such tweet about Canadian
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau Donald
Trump saying Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild
during our g7 meetings only to give a
news conference after I left saying that
u.s. tariffs were kind of insulting and
he will not be pushed around very
dishonest and weak our tariffs are in
response to his of two hundred seventy
percent on dairy Trump then gave a
bizarre rambling press conference that
was completely incoherent during which
he slammed CNN as fake news and said all
sorts of other things that made
absolutely no sense and then upon
leaving on his way to Singapore he
tweeted that he disagrees with the
communique that was sent out wrapping up
the entire summit saying quote based on
Justin's referring to Justin Trudeau
based on Justin's false statements at
his news conference and the fact that
Canada is charging massive tariffs to
our US farmers workers and companies I
have instructed our US representatives
not to endorse the communique as we look
at tariffs on automobiles flooding the
US market he claimed that our
relationship with allies is a 10 and yet
he's sending out insulting tweets about
our allies and then most interestingly
just in terms of the like the
flavor and color of the thing the
pictures that have been released are
truly embarrassing I mean really
indicative of a total and utter cuckold
REE check out pictures of Trump during
the summit versus Obama during a recent
similar summit you see at the top of
your screen Donald President Obama
rather in control in command clearly
respected as appear by other world
leaders and at the bottom of the screen
you see this picture of German
Chancellor Angela Merkel looking like
she's indignantly lecturing the little
kid at the table who won't eat his
broccoli meaning Donald Trump himself
and hilariously Donald Trump is known
for these handshake games that he plays
to sort of assert dominance whether it's
with Japanese leader Shinzo Abe a or
many others he tries to kind of jerk
them around with his handshake and
French President Emmanuel macron
dominating Trump in the first picture
I'm showing our video audience you see
Donald Trump clearly not in control of
the handshake you see a manual McCrone
with quite a grip there on Donald
Trump's right hand and then in a
close-up of Donald Trump's hand taken
immediately after this you can actually
see the thumbprint and the print from
the Crone's fourth and fifth fingers on
Trump's hand this was just moments after
the handshake and I mentioned this last
thing I get that it's sort of a goof
handshake games are really stupid but
they're important to Trump and by his
own standards of what's important he
clearly lost the game to Emmanuel macron
but handshakes aside another
embarrassing appearance by Trump
willfully ignorant bragging about not
preparing for negotiations with Kim
jong-un the world moving ahead without
the United States and there are trumpets
that are reveling in this as if it's
Trump putting America first not taking
crap from world leaders it is abundantly
clear that the u.s. is just being
excluded and is not seen as the player
it once was on the world stage and if
you don't mind that then congratulations
I guess by some harebrained logic Donald
Trump is winning but the United States
is increasingly not a player in world
climate change discussions and why would
be--that's by Chuck Trump's choice
the dynamics of the g7 in Canada
confirmed that while Trump arriving late
was disrespectful and an inconvenience
his presence was also a bother and an
inconvenience to the adults in the room
including very clearly German Chancellor
Angela Merkel realistically the new
leader of the free world as well as the
leaders of Japan and France and Canada
and the u.s. is being relegated to a
lower tier in the context of
international leadership period if
you're at rumpus then you see that as
winning well then yeah I guess Donald
Trump is winning but by any sensible
assessment the United States has been
taken down several notches on the world
stage and the world is laughing at us
right and the cherry on top which is
what I want to discuss in more depth
next is the the shrapnel that came from
this diplomatic abortion ended with
Donald Trump threatening to end all
trade with American allies let's talk
about that next
if there is one statement that Donald
Trump made in and around the g7 summit
in Canada that stands out as
particularly outrageous especially
ignorant it's his threat to end all
trade with American allies period
leaving the g7 summit Donald Trump said
the United States might end all trade
with some of our closest allies if they
don't do what Trump wants and also told
the leaders of Britain France Germany
Japan Canada and Italy that there should
be no tariffs period between them and
the United States let's break this down
it is either stunning ignorance or an
empty threat let's assume for a moment
that it's not an empty threat that Trump
really is thinking of doing this and
he's ignorant to the repercussions let's
explore what that might be like
specialization okay the idea that
countries are better off not making
everything themselves that they use but
making some things and importing out
others okay this is a basic fundamental
tenet of economics there is a major
debate over trade policy there's debate
over tariffs over import-export policy
over economic isolationism about finding
the right balance for lots of economic
factors but the idea that countries are
better off
doing some trade with other countries at
least to some degree it's a really old
idea and it's not a controversial
economic idea at all the controversy
comes in when you want to start
considering ok well can we build a trade
policy that although it might make
products cheaper in our country it might
also leave our own workers with lower
wages right it starts to get complex and
it starts to get into gray area and I
apologize for punching the mic I'm just
so invigorated by this conversation that
we're having these are complex economic
issues but the concept of specialized
and trade to some extent is a tenet of
modern Western democratic economies
period and Trump's threat to end trade
with our allies is as dangerous as it is
ignorant so let's talk about Trump's
ultimatum Trump's ultimatum is remove
all tariffs or we might stop trading
with you altogether there are advocates
of totally free trade right and and if
you want to take Trump's belligerents
and kind of like ascribe some policy to
it the policy is totally free trade and
there is a major debate to be had over
free trade the problem is that Moke most
people who claim to want free trade
don't really want it they want a version
of so-called free trade that benefits
them but they still want subsidies and
tariffs where it benefits them as well
and there are almost no true advocates

the david pakman show at david
pakman.com just days after the FCC's net
neutrality repeal was enacted which was
on Monday CNN is reporting that a TN
t--'s buyout of Time Warner which owns
CNN has been approved by a judge and
we're descending even further into what
I'm calling media consolidation dystopia
and I first reported to you who knows
when I mean late 2016 that AT&T made a
deal to buy Time Warner for 85 billion
dollars some people are calling it a
merger it's really a buyout but
effectively it is the coming together of
these two companies I think it's okay to
call it a merger even though legally
speaking that's not what it is I told
you that this deal would be disaster for
consumers okay it would be bad for
competition it would raise prices it
would reduce choice and I told you at
the time that there should be legal
challenges to that merger or buy out and
there were including from the Trump
administration although possibly for
personally vindictive reasons rather
than questions of antitrust but a judge
yesterday has ruled in favor of the
buyout AT&T now says they're gonna close
the deal out by June 20th this is days
away the judge even said don't bother
bother with Appeals because appeals
would be unjust in this particular case
and we know that Donald Trump has had
been at least sort of nominally opposed
to the buyout but it's mostly because
the guy doesn't like CNN and Time Warner
is owned by CNN but nevertheless it's
happening despite Trump's wishes despite
my wishes and a lot of other people's
wishes this is going to happen and
content that is produced by Netflix and
Amazon which for all the criticisms that
we can have about Netflix and Amazon
Netflix and Amazon were causing
cord-cutting people canceling cable
right that was putting some competitive
pressure
on the big cable providers Netflix and
Amazon are now going to be potentially
hurt by this buyout AT&T could if they
wanted give their own content right like
Time Warner content soon to be priority
and then charge more to Netflix or to
Netflix users to use their bandwidth you
want to pay more for Netflix or do you
want to watch Time Warner content and
lots of people will say I'm already
getting gouged by AT&T I'm not gonna pay
even more to be able to watch Netflix
content without constant rebuffering I
don't know you could say I'll cancel my
cable and just buy internet from AT&T
well then your internet becomes much
more expensive because you no longer
have a bundled package and it's still
Netflix com that could be slowed down or
deprioritize so good luck with that and
we have in the last I guess 72 hours the
inaction of the net neutrality repeal
and even more media consolidation
consumers are going to have a very bad
time and I wonder and I'm not asking
this rhetorically I genuinely wonder
what is CNN's coverage of net neutrality
going to look like after this buyout
then I remembered oh right they barely
covered it to begin with so I guess
that's not going to change much we're
still not gonna hear a damn thing about
net neutrality from CNN or Time Warner
or AT&T and this is only going to
continue this is a signal if you are
Comcast which is potentially going to be
buying part of Fox or Disney which also
wants to buy part of Fox or is trying to
already if you see this decision from
the judge and you see the direction that
this is going it's a green light for
even further consolidation and we've
been tracking and participating in the
rise of independent media for years
right we are an independent media
program we've been covering independent
media and there are two forces which
could completely decimate our industry
it's not even really an industry it's
more of a niche number one getting rid
of net neutrality just happened right
decided months ago enacted on Monday and
more media consolidation happening and
more is coming and if you want just like
a little hint as to how the future of
these mega mergers is going to go look
at the fact that the judge in this case
imposed no additional conditions on AT&T
buying time warner the judge just said
sounds good to me and don't even bother
appealing so this is it I don't know
what else to call it
then a Red Alert dystopia yeah it's
really bad and maybe et and Time Warner
don't have a monopoly on the industry
but telecommunications is so big of an
industry and impacts so many people in
so many different ways you may get your
news through it you may connect with
people on it may get entertained by it
and so it's really upsetting that you
know fewer and fewer voices are gonna be
heard from all of us I think you know
Comcast owns what is it NBC and then
Viacom and CBS maybe getting together to
I think we're gonna see a lot more of
this it is the exact sort of cautionary
tale that for about 25 years really I
mean at least 22 years since the 1996
Telecommunications Act but really 25 or
even 30 years Media serious media
analysts and academics have been warning
about and it's happening your media will
become more expensive you will have to
work harder to find alternative media
the distributors of media as Pat is
pointing out are increasingly going to
be the producers of media as well and if
you're if you're hoping that now I get
to Pat silver linings that people
sometimes hear or me telling you what to
do to fix this
I don't know right I mean I'd say
contact your representatives except
they're mostly okay with this stuff
Democrats did vote for net neutrality
but really all of them part complicit in
the status quo that's being perpetuated
vote them out then right I don't know
what else to say yeah it's a call to
action to support the shows that you
like the specific websites you like and
you know maybe supporting independent
media shows like ours very nice I like
that Pat clip pat's now getting in on
the indirect references to membership in
patreon but seriously I actually don't
have good news I like to try to wrap up
the story with some at least cautiously
optimistic something and I don't have it
because it's really really getting bad
just one day
for calling kim jeong-hoon smart funny
and a great person Donald Trump is so
upset with Canadian Prime Minister
Justin Trudeau that he's now going to be
punishing the people of Canada Trump was
interviewed by George Stephanopoulos in
the this was the same interview we'll
talk about later where Trump ascribed to
himself one of the greatest human
memories of all time which was why he
didn't need to take any notes during
that meeting with Kim jong-un
during the same interview Trump said
that he is just so displeased with
Justin Trudeau's recent press conference
that he is going to make it cost a lot
of money for the people of Canada he
learned you can't do that you can't do
that said Trump speaking about Justin
Trudeau we have simultaneously direct
threats to the people of one of our
great allies Canada and compliments all
around for a brutal dictator Kim jong-un
who has his own family members murdered
in cold blood what does this do for the
prospects of renegotiating NAFTA which
Trump has campaigned on it's not gonna
help what does this do for Trump
standing for Trump sort of position
within the g7 which was already pretty
touch-and-go doesn't help and it's not
even totally clear what set Trump off
about the Trudeau press conference
Trudeau has been critical of the steel
and aluminum tariffs he said that Canada
isn't going to be pushed around by Trump
but that's not an insult right it's it's
just saying we are a country and we can
make decisions and we're not going to be
pushed around it's notable only if the
assumption is Trump should be expected
to be allowed to push anybody who he
wants to push around around and I was
talking to some Canadian friends who
said yeah listen I don't agree with what
is being said by Donald Trump here but
this is great for Justin Trudeau and I
looked into the approval ratings for
Trudeau and as of just a couple of
months ago Justin Trudeau's party had
only a 44% approval which for Trump
would be a record high but for Trudeau
is actually quite low and Trump
attacking Trudeau and threatening
Canadians is actually a gift to
Trudeau's reelection chances and I don't
know if that's
they welcomed by Trudeau or now I don't
know if he's aware of it but he has now
set up Justin Trudeau to not give an
inch on trade deals and to have
Canadians still support him and doing it
right if Trump hadn't attacked Trudeau
and the Canadian people Trudeau would
actually take some flak for resisting
renegotiating a trade deal or signing a
trade deal or whatever Canadians now are
gonna stand behind the guy even if in
the short term he makes decisions that
might not be the best decisions for
Canada Canadians are going to be
increasingly willing to say you know
what Trump went after him Trump went
after us and we stand behind Justin
Trudeau holding firm here because we
don't want him to be pushed around I
don't know what the future is of
Canadian US relations but what I do know
is that the contrast between how Trump
is treating Kim jong-un and treating
Justin Trudeau is unimaginable would
have been unimaginable a year ago two to
three years ago and I think that this is
probably a good thing for Trudeau yeah
my sense is that this will certainly
backfire on Trump because Canadians seem
a lot more liberal than us here in the
United States and what Trump is really
saying is that Trudeau doesn't care
about his own people so much because
he's going to let them be victims of a
trade war sure contrast that to what he
said about Kim jong-un at the summit
which is that Kim loves his own people
you can't really make that argument when
the guy has gulags his killing his own
people the guy who's killing his own
family members
forcing famine and starvation upon his
own people and running one of the most
brutal totalitarian regimes according to
trump loves his people but Justin
Trudeau apparently is indifferent to the
Canadian people because he quote
insulted Trump
I guess merely by saying he's not going
to be pushed around this is a new era of
American diplomacy even though you can't
really call it that and geopolitics and
consider once again right this is what I
keep going back to the contrast between
our relationship with Canada and North
Korea Canada has teams in our sports
leagues North Korea sent otto warmbier
back to us in a coma
and Trump is friendlier over the last
week with Kim jong-un than he is with
Justin Trudeau Trudeau might actually
get more respect from Trump if he
decided to start developing nukes
forcing starvation upon the Canadian
people and having his uncle murdered or
something like that because that's what
Kim jong-un has done and it's getting
compliments for Trump it is the era of
the United States of America embracing
North Korea and Russia and Turkey
while seemingly deliberately ruining our
relationships with the European Union
and Canada and Mexico I guess this is
what they meant by Trump would be an
unconventional president or something is
that what we can say yeah it just seems
like he's taking all these positive
relationships with Canada with it you
for granted which you can never do right
you can never lay off the gas I think
Trump aswer argue though that you have
to keep your friends close and your
enemies closer that's apparently what
he's doing now they would argue that now
because it can be used to defend what
Trump is doing they would not have
argued that under Obama or under
Democratic presidents that's for sure
send me your thoughts and my question is
and this is not a rhetorical question
what the hell is going on that's my
question I'm on Twitter at D Pakman the
show is on Twitter at David Pakman show

18 all right it's time let's get into
this week's hatred mail so what if the
president's been accused of sexual
harassment 15 times or that he paid hush
money to a porn star
at least he never wore a tan suit
patriot mail written by patriots who
hate David Pakman because America and
because freedom so last week hatred mail
coined a new phrase that I really like
which is ad Homme of him instead of ad
hominem it's an ad hominem this week
there's another new phrase coined by
hatred mail but it makes no sense the
phrase is anti facets it's opportune and
if that doesn't make any sense to you it
certainly doesn't make any sense to me
let's take a listen David Pakman I had
sex with your wife you cook I am
clicking not interested in the David
Pakman show don't want to listen to this
pc vindictive ex show anymore a news
radio station David Pakman and a wife
whose bidders ass is also clearly greedy
didn't you have concerns David hmm
auntie Fosse to eat supper tuned exactly
right auntie facet sits off poor tune
and
a good its opportune to you Pat it's
good to have you back on the program is
yeah is that like a prescription
medication name I'd have no idea what
that is I I think I actually saw a
commercial for talking to your doctor
about anti facets it's opportune on late
late night television last night here's
one phrase that I know the meaning of
precisely and it's hey tree at 40 that's
the coupon code that'll save you forty
percent off of a david pakman show
membership and every time you sign up
for membership using the coupon code hey
tree at forty thirteen hey tree it's
shed it's here and I think that that's
something we can all be very very glad
about it is starting to get stunningly
stupid with the earth Korea situation
that the United States finds itself in I
mentioned yesterday after the summit
that Donald Trump clearly thinks that he
is won and his followers have been
tricked into thinking the exact same
thing and as I pointed out yesterday the
so-called deal that was made is almost
identical to many past deals where North
Korea has agreed in principle to
denuclearization and to seek peace or
whatever else but most importantly
nothing was actually done and most
importantly in this negotiation nothing
has actually taken place so far we have
a very vague and non-committal single
piece of paper signed by Donald Trump
and Kim jong-eun Trump has said that
he's stopping military exercises near
North Korea North Korea hasn't yet
proven that it's going to do any of the
things that Kim jong-un signed off that
he would be doing and what is absolutely
stunning is that in the last twelve or
so hours North Korea's state media
agency KCNA is now claiming that Donald
Trump has agreed to lift all sanctions
on North Korea is this true Trump didn't
mention it it's possible that KCNA is
lying but at the same time Donald Trump
did say in this bizarre press conference
after the summit that after they signed
the piece of paper there were a bunch of
toss ins both Kim jong-un and Donald
Trump mentioned a bunch of extra stuff
of course only verbally not in writing
anywhere that they were going to be
doing so has Trump agreed to lift sank
on North Korea in exchange for nothing
actually being done yet White House
hasn't commented at least as of a couple
of hours ago but if indeed Trump did
lift sanctions on North Korea it's
another one of these examples of Trump
doing something in exchange for nothing
because North Korea hasn't done anything
yet and there are trumpets who will hear
me and they'll write in and they saw
David I thought you were against war and
against conflict why don't you want to
get along with North Korea and I do want
to get along with North Korea but North
Korea is a brutal regime with forced
starvation
political killings totalitarian control
and no master negotiator which Donald
Trump claims to be should start just
giving concessions away like candy
before you either get something back or
at least get an assurance something
binding that you're going to get
something back and this dangerous
blindness to reality is particularly
evident in Donald Trump's recent tweets
this morning Donald Trump took to
Twitter I guess as he was arriving back
from Singapore saying first quote before
taking office people were assuming that
we were going to war with North Korea
President Obama said that North Korea
was our biggest and most dangerous
problem no longer sleep well tonight
then also tweeting just landed a long
trip but everybody can now feel much
safer than the day I took office there
is no longer a nuclear threat from North
Korea meeting with Kim jong-un was an
interesting and very positive experience
north Korea has great potential for the
future the degree of nuclear threat from
North Korea hasn't changed from 48 hours
ago because nobody has done anything yet
Kim jong-un has made vague non-binding
sort of commitments to start making
changes at some point in the future the
idea that Donald Trump would come back
and remember we are now in a world where
his statements on Twitter are to some
degree official statements that they
communicate what the president truly
believes is going on the idea that Trump
thinks the nuclear threat
North Korea has been eliminated is
stunningly ignorant and dangerous he
signed a piece of paper agreeing to
things that North Korea has previously
agreed to do and then for subsequently
ignored and Trump is literally tweeting
no more nuclear threat from North Korea
on the off chance that this doesn't work
out Trump in apparently some kind of
exhaustion delirium from being awake
more than 24 hours told the truth
yesterday before leaving Singapore and
Trump said listen you know what if Kim
jong-un doesn't stick to what he said he
was going to do I'll come up with some
excuse as to why it's not my fault
anyway bizarre video of Trump being
strangely honest after the summit take a
look I think he's I think honestly I
think he's gonna do these things I may
be wrong I mean I may stand before you
in six months and say hey I was wrong I
don't know that I'll ever admit that but
I'll find just I'll find some kind of an
excuse okay one or two one more come on
Trump's joking about it but that's
actually exactly what he will do right
it's it's it's brilliant in its evil
genius he has claimed victory including
on Twitter saying nuclear threat from
Luke Vargas joins me today from
Singapore he's the chief foreign
correspondent for talk media news he
also hosts the weekly foreign policy
radio show and podcast wake with luke
vargas he was he's not just vacationing
in singapore he actually has been there
for the trump kim jong hoon summit and
let's sort of start with the basics Luke
I mean talk about the setting talk about
the structure of the meetings what can
we glean sort of not so much from the
actual paper that was signed but from
body language and kind of like the
flavor of what's been going on there
well I've been here for a while and I'm
gonna be here longer than apparently I
need to be there was some talk among the
white house planners that everything was
ready for this to possibly go into a
second day and as we'll talk about later
the fact that the deal met that rapport
was strong the deal making was occurring
right even after the unike was signed
I'm not quite sure and I wish I could
have asked President Trump or someone
else why did it get this someone could
cut off where it got cut off but that's
a matter for another day this is the
perfect place in my view for a
high-stakes international summit
Singapore maybe like a country like Oman
which also plays one of these unique
sort of regional power brokering roles
has figured out most of its domestic
issues and kind of like a really good
friend and a stable relationship is just
there to help you out you know and and
they're eager to pick up the tab and and
you know handle the security for foreign
dignitaries and I have to say the this
is the safest city in the world
according to a number of different
studies and I think in many ways that
was palpable just going to all these
conference events I mean there was
security and a big military presence but
I've had you know encountered more more
militaristic security approach to events
in New York City and I think a lot of
that has to do with the fact that
Singapore is so safe there's not a lot
of other through the factors that could
really mess this whole sum it up the
summit itself not that interesting in
many ways if it was not the in my view
the pomp and circumstance even at the
DMZ meeting between North Korea and
South Korea and April where you had all
these military honor guards and music
and and all these photo ops there are
some of that yesterday but not quite as
much it's
started with a 40-minute meeting face to
face some people were as freaking out
about this historians and journalists
because there was no one else in the
room other than the heads of state and
their translators I sort of saw this is
a good thing and these are two leaders
that do need to get to know each other
and and if the goal here is to avert you
know a nuclear war then even spending 40
minutes talking about cars or New York
City nightlife is better than you know
not having a chance just to look into
your adversaries eyes so that's how it
begins then relatively boilerplate two
and a half three hours of bilateral
meetings and culminating in this signed
agreement we'll get to that one second
and body language I think in many ways
Kim Jong Un's body language was the one
to watch I think we know how President
Trump comports himself I thought Kim in
many ways was mirroring Trump at points
he's a man who's shorter and that's
always been a concern to his aides who
have wanted to make sure get overpowered
when standing next to Trump I thought
Kim did a great job sort of matching his
posture and gait if you look at these
photos of the two men walking down these
colonnades at the hotel they are almost
walking in precisely unison with each
other I think that's Kim
mirroring Trump not the other way around
and yet I also thought Kim in many ways
is cognizant that you know for his
propaganda film makers he wants to give
them two types of summits right he wants
to give them enough material that looks
like he's affable a genial man who's
willing to play nice with an adversary
but also subtle physical gestures
putting his hand on Trump's back as he
they walk out of a room that if any
point where the relationship goes south
again he can say look you know I I you
know was walking this guy around and
leading him everywhere and so I thought
he was certainly very conscious of the
way he was appearing on cameras yeah and
maybe some elements have shared bonding
over food I mean neither of them is
particularly trim and and that that may
have been something that that led to the
furthering of the possibility of
international peace negotiations but
let's get to the actual joint statement
that was put out right which my analysis
not to redo it all for you now but my
analysis was not unlike that that of
some others I thought that what most of
what was in the agreement the joint
statement was relatively unremarkable
mirroring commitments that have been
both vague and unenforceable from North
in the past and I'm curious how was the
content of that statement communicated
to you guys to press that were there
terribly we were all stuck on in buses
about 200 or so journalists dividin it's
not just you know people like me or even
sort of younger journalists it was
network news anchors and Hannity was on
another bus I saw Hertz from Fox News
you know slumped against a doe and a hot
bus waiting in traffic all of us were
stuck in the middle of Singapore traffic
trying to get to the press conference
several hours later and everyone's
huddled around cellphones trying to
listen to the signing statements and
then trying to figure out what had been
signed I mean the White House is
spinning this already everyone's talking
about a historic deal yet nobody knows
what has actually been signed and the
White House doesn't send anything
officially until three hours later which
is an hour into Trump's hour and five
minute press conference and so if I
understand correctly Trump's doing the
press conference he's already well into
the press conference bragging about what
was achieved but that's the content of
the statement that they signed had not
yet been communicated to the press
that's correct I mean they're Bloomberg
I believe was the photography pool for
the signing statement and they had a
telephoto lens of course and zoomed in
and one of their reporters they probably
kept it in-house for a minute and try to
analyze it but then they sort of started
circulating snippets of it but I guess
it's always possible that something else
was signed or the formal agreement was
different than what was brought to the
table so we didn't really report on and
fully but yeah in the press conference
you can hear Trump sort of saying
everyone's seen this and the reporters
including myself started shouting back
no we haven't and a finally he gets the
message and sort of says hey guys send
it to them but they still don't do it
for you know 25 minutes or something
it's back to the content of the document
it's really four paragraphs at the end
of the day the joke is that these things
called joint communique zuv which this
was a sort was a communique to
communicate that it really didn't have
much meat on it the four key elements
two of them I think we can just toss out
right away they're very vague pledges to
build a peace regime on the Korean
Peninsula to revitalize the relationship
and there's nothing wrong with even
saying you're going to revitalize the
relationship but one would have expected
something more a date for exchanging
ambassador
maybe a pledge to create a special
interest section or interest section in
Pyongyang and maybe one in DC but again
that's very vague there is a nuclear
line which says that essentially there's
no new language here that they're going
to stick up for the pamela zhang
declaration which is from April that's
the document that was signed at the end
of the DMZ summit and that document also
if you go into that it's a little bit
longer than this but it also just talks
about phased disarmament and doesn't
have the new specifics and that was
purposeful that document was crafted
because there was an expectation that
when Trump and Kim met there'd be more
robust nuclear language that would
supersede it and of course that hasn't
happened and now the pennmen jean
declaration looks beefier than this
and the final point which having just
read the Korean Central News Agency
North Korean propaganda story about
appears like it was a spontaneous ask
from Trump which was relating to the
POVs getting back the remains of people
you know Americans who died or were
captured in North Korea in the 1950s
during the Korean War and whose remains
are still there and seemingly on the
spot according to the Koreans that you
know Kim just acceded to this demand and
that was the fourth of the four
paragraphs but imagine this document
which already looks weak lacking that
paragraph one that Trump was talking up
repeatedly during the press conference
there isn't a lot of meat on the bone so
let's talk about the press conference
you were in the third row during the
press conference and there were a number
of sort of unusual elements during this
press conference once was that there was
this video that we would have assumed
was North Korean propaganda it was
actually produced by the White House and
we were talking about that on the
program today also there were references
sort of offhandedly to additional
provisions that Trump and Kim jong-un
sort of discussed verbally after the
joint statement was signed which of
course exists nowhere on paper and make
this entire thing even more bizarre in
my mind which is that it seems as though
the differences between this negotiation
and prior negotiations exist only
verbally and took place after the
signing of the document that was
published
yeah well that notion of a tossin is a
real-estate term I mean you do these
once you sign something on paper then
the landlord is throw
in all sorts of concessions and the the
new you know tenant is excited oh the
landlord's listening to my demands but
conveniently they're all you know verbal
agreements and you can never point to a
lease and say hey you know we we you
said you were gonna dismantle that
nuclear site like you know install the
new washing machine so yeah I mean
there's a huge gulf between the deal
that's on paper and the deal president
Trump seems he you know think about in
his head let's talk first about the
video which startled all the reporters
there was no introduction to this and it
was a Korean first they played it in
Korean and then looped it all back again
so it's like a five minute video played
twice for us and we did actually think
it was in North Korean you know
multimedia material that was brought and
it had all all parts and if you've seen
at risk of identify denting the Donald
Trump offspring is either Eric or Donald
Trump jr. who had a promotional video
for a new like a shared workspace living
community in Dumbo and Brooklyn and it
looked a lot I mean you know I would be
not surprised if it was the same sort of
marketing team that did both of these
videos it has all this you know it's the
hallmark you know stock footage of a
basketball player with no uniform
dunking on a court on a parquet with no
logos on it either it's like and then
shots of the condos in South Beach this
was apparently a video Donald Trump
played to Kim and I was thinking like if
you're a US ally let's add Botswana
who's like doing most things right and
but they could be better the economy is
ok but why not have a much more
prosperous economy are you gonna get any
sort of presentation from Trump like
become our friend and like we'll make
make you the country of your dreams no
he's giving this pitch to a guy who's
you know a murderous dictator that also
seemed odd and then we'll talk about the
tossings I mean so the biggest one of
course is a concession from the US which
isn't anywhere on paper and it's
possible like other things
Trump has demanded of the military that
they are going to wait for some more
formal order to in this case stop the
joint military exercises with South
Korea and maybe they'll never actually
get it certainly Trump's decision to
call these war games
to say they aren't necessary for
American and Korean security that
they're too expensive that Korea isn't
footing enough of the bill the Pentagon
doesn't share those beliefs and is
operating on the assumption that they
work the military exercises are going to
continue the other tossin czar
concessions coming from North Korea
saying they're going to destroy a
missile facility of saying that they're
going to stop nuclear and ballistic
missile tests again that would be a
really nice thing to have in writing
because they have never agreed to that
formally before but Trump seems to thank
this again most important nuclear
related matters of this whole summit are
it's fine to just leave those as in sort
of informal handshake agreements and of
course there's an innocent explanation
here and a cynical one the innocent one
being look this is their very sensitive
issues they don't want to mess them up
they don't want to be premature and
putting language out there that both
sides might not agree to and there is
agreement on all sorts of fronts they're
just going to wait a few weeks to put it
on paper the much more cynical
explanation which I'm somewhat more
inclined to believe is that you know
take take out the pow2 man that Trump
apparently had the last minute which did
gets you know moved into the agreement
and there actually isn't anything these
guys are not the positions are not
converging despite all the recent
meetings and Trump goes up to the podium
saying shoot I didn't agree to anything
let me just sort of start talking about
some unicorn deal that doesn't exist
will it into existence and that's that
would be concerning of course Luke in
the limited time we have left
lack of nuclear knowledge seemed to be a
theme of the press conference that that
happened there in other words Trump
talked a lot hyperbolically
about successes but it didn't really
seem as though he knew much about sort
of how so-called nuclear works how
disarmament would work or really any of
the logistics he didn't and he also keep
one of the details that would be really
nice to have is what is this ballistic
site related to the engine program of
the ballistic missile program in North
Korea that they're going to destroy
because there's already one called a
hari it's the driver and engine facility
I think and and that's already slated
for destruction so if that's what it is
then this is a really a nothing burger
negotiation point he agreed to destroy
something that's slated for destruction
right the other bits are this tweet sent
from Air Force one where Trump says now
the nuclear issue is off the table of
course that impossible unless the
nuclear threat is removed or destroyed
which it hasn't been and this also
notion from Trump that you know and I
think he said this in the press
conference that you know once you start
to even partially take apart the nuclear
program the threat but the rest sort of
just figure it solves itself which is
the opposite of what experts say which
is that even if you get rid of all the
material and all the launch sites you
still have in North Korea at least a
whole you know sort of rank and file of
thousands of nuclear scientists who
possess intimate knowledge of how to get
back to that nuclear threshold again and
unless you retrain them or give them
something else to do they're a very
potent political force in North Korea
and they also hold the keys to
restarting that program so what he talks
about nuclear weapons just signals he
doesn't really know what he's talking
about Luke we're gonna keep following it
question what has been the most
interesting or unique a food item you've
had while in Singapore gosh I haven't
been terribly adventurous I'm trying to
think there the Marriott hotel which
sponsored the journalists had buffets
every night and there were some odd sea
creature salads with without much
garnish that I largely stayed away from
them but other than that it was sort of
american-style dining for the last few
days so now that I'm caught up on sleep
and all the diplomats of left town I am
gonna branch out and see the rest of the
city all right Luke Vargas chief foreign
correspondent for talk media news
unseasoned sea creature salads you heard
it here first that was one of the big
revelations from the summit in Singapore
Luke pleasure as always to be talking to
you thanks David talk to you soon
it's a pleasure to be joined today by
Richard McGowan who is professor at the
Carroll school at Boston College we are
going to be talking about sin taxes we
are going to be talking in part two of
our interview about the recent Supreme
Court decision that will greatly expand
sports gambling and sports betting on
sports Richard thank you so much for
joining me today great to be with you so
let's start sort of broadly I mean when
we are talking about activity that the
government has identified as problematic
in some way or activity that the
government wants to curb or encourage
people not to participate in one
possibility is criminalization another
is regulation which includes taxation
can you give a sort of a general sense
of what the issues at play are when an
activity has been identified that we
want to curb and sort of what
possibilities there are and how we want
to manage that well let's just first
list the traditional what we would call
sin industries and I had a couple of new
ones now traditionally it started out
without all because in the United States
clearly the first thing that was taxed
was was alcohol and of course we had the
whiskey rebellion from that then then we
had cigarettes and then finally you had
gambling in its own little worm now
ironically we're adding marijuana and in
lots of locations right now soda is
becoming almost a sin industry so you
have you've got things that the
government wants there's using and
there's there's there's at least two and
then sometimes three goals the
government wants once one is obviously
to raise revenue so all these activities
you can tax and I always say it's
painless revenue because in other words
people feel somewhat guilty doing them
so therefore when the government taxes
you you don't you don't complain as much
about it the other thing is clearly you
also and this is where the government
gets it something a little bit of
contrariness the government wants you to
do they want to dissuade you from doing
the activity so they're making money
from you but they want you this they
don't want you to do the activity and
then in lots of the cases we
especially with alcohol and gambling and
marijuana you have what they want to
discourage the black market and so
there's where that there's usually three
things involved I'm not a sort of at a
base level like at a philosophical level
against the taxation or raising of
revenue by governments in these ways but
it's hard for me to get past the reality
that speeding tickets for example which
is a sort of different thing presumably
the idea is the police want you to obey
the law and that's why if you exceed the
speed limit you risk getting pulled over
and you get a ticket and presumably if
that happens next time you might be
careful you might not speed but the
police departments do become reliant on
that revenue so on the one hand it's
purportedly a mechanism to get people to
behave the way that the government or
police want them to behave but at the
same time if everybody did it police
would have a really hard time funding
their operations and there's a sort of
similar dynamic when it comes to some of
these sin taxes how should we interpret
that in other words does the government
really want to dissuade people from
doing these things well for instance for
years the government would raise the
excise tax on cigarette just enough that
they would make more revenue look
clearly but clearly they didn't raise it
enough to dissuade people and it took
the whole second hand smoking situation
where people said the non-smokers
following so I have rights
not the smell of smoking that's what
government didn't said you know well
let's raise the tax is really high and
that's really now trying to discourage
people from smoking so you're right
there for instance in the alcohol
industry you could you really know that
it's interesting in in the vast vast
majority of states beer is taxed at a
much much lesson rate than distilled
spirits and somehow there it's
interesting sometimes the government
also declares the type of activity that
they actually want you to do even if it
is a sin industry so clearly in most
states the government would prefer you
to to drink beer and not distilled
spirits and wine is considered in
between and let's look at gambling the
government has a monopoly on lotteries
and therefore really really what they
really would prefer you to do is to
spend your money on lotteries if you
have casinos in the state you only tax
them at most between 25 percent so
clearly the gambling dollar from the
government's point of view is better
much better and that notice the
government does try to make you feel
good about betting the lottery even
though it's a horrible bit when we talk
about something like the lottery or
maybe with alcohol or with any when it
with any of these is there a way that or
let me rephrase it in a different way if
the government truly wanted to just get
people to stop doing this all together
what would actually be the action that
they would do would it be setting the
tax so high that it would no longer be a
viable business would it be full-out
criminalization even though we know that
with many of these vices it just creates
a black market it doesn't actually get
people to stop like if the government
rather than raising revenue wanted to
actually stop people from engaging in
this activity what would be the most
effective means of achieving that I mean
the problem with raising the tax up to
high is the very thing you just
mentioned a minute ago
is it your court created a black market
for instance in with cigarettes it
became whenever let's let's go back 50
years David and it's really kind of
interesting we have back 50 years ago
almost 40 percent of the adult
population smoked cigarettes and you had
one state with the lottery New Hampshire
then you had one state with casino
gambling and now 50 years later or 55
years later to be exact
you now have 28 states with some form of
casino gambling 48 states have some kind
of the lottery and notice gambling has
been accepted cigarettes have not been
accepted so what you're getting out
there is kind of government when the
government goes after us in does it make
it culturally on not viable anymore so
that's the interesting thing with
cigarettes I mean they they got tax and
it's almost as if the government said
alright let's really tax them now put it
into it and that way we'll save what
wants health care but with gambling
we're not going to do that and
so it's so why gambling is socially
acceptable for the government versus
cigarettes but in general I would say
it's going to be taxes but I also say
the government has two for instance with
cigarettes they could start doing a lot
more on in five cigarettes I guarantee
you they are not going to sponsor
anti-gambling ads you've worked as a
consultant to help States
look at how they want to regulate casino
and and lottery operations without
obviously sharing private or you know
sensitive information for us what are
the sort of dynamics of those
discussions with states in other words
is the attitude of the states when
they're speaking candidly with you if
indeed they are and I don't know if they
will even speak candidly with you do
they say we don't really think that this
is a good thing but we're going to allow
it for revenue purposes or sort of like
what's what's their attitude when they
are having these discussions well I
think you just know no one is ever gonna
be saying I'm Pro gambling what you say
is people are doing it we'd like to we
like to put the black market or the or
the organized-crime out of the business
so therefore let's let's let's raise the
let's get the revenue and maybe we can
do some good with the revenue as opposed
to what organized crime could do with
the revenue so it's give you an old
story and isn't but it's a very true
story when Massachusetts first started
its lottery how they set up their game
the daily number game they went and they
raided the bookies in the north end of
the Boston that's where all them where
all the bookies were found out how the
bookies set up their game gave a certain
amount they gave better odds in the
bookie and they put the bookies out of
business ironically that also forced the
organized crime into drugs so I would
probably your answer is most people are
saying how we deal with the addiction
issue with gambling at the same time
people are going to gamble so that's
that's that's gets the revenue and is
that the same sort of logic you would
apply to marijuana legalization
it's exactly the same lot the thing with
marijuana is
it's interesting once again it is the
same you'll want to raise the revenue
you're gonna probably try to discourage
too many people from doing it and at the
same time you want to put the black
market out so the big thing with
marijuana is what's the tax rate you're
going to put on so the people would
rather go buy from the state than from
from the organized crime let's pause
there we're speaking with Richard
McGowan who's a professor at the Carroll
school at Boston College we'll pick up
our conversation with him tomorrow we're
continuing our conversation with Richard
McGowan he is a professor in the Carroll
school at Boston College we've been
talking about sin taxes the taxation of
alcohol marijuana regulation etc and I
want to get now to the topic of sports
gambling we've had a recent Supreme
Court decision stemming from an appealed
case from New Jersey which is going to
make it easier and possible for sports
gambling to expand to many more states
so to start this conversation Richard
what if anything distinguishes sports
gambling from the other vices that we've
discussed it really isn't all that much
to be quite honest David it's the same
logic people are already doing it
there's lots of lots of people doing it
now there is one huge difference with
sports gambling and that is the vast
majority of people who sports gamble are
doing it online they do not go younger
and so it's not going to the local
bookie and things like that anymore
so again but the logic here is new
jersey decided they needed something
that would would make their casinos
unique in the northeast they wanted to
have casino gambling
so they what's the revenue issue then
obviously trying to put whatever the
black market online basically out of
business and then finally they're trying
to discourage consumption somewhat and
trying to comply with age limits and
things like that one there has been one
difference touted and I'm curious to get
your reaction as to whether it's sort of
a material practical difference of any
value which is that with sports gambling
you do have the possibility of
individuals who are sort of determining
the outcome possibly parts
in the bedding right whether it's
players or referees that might be
involved and of course that would be
against the law it would also be against
the rules of whatever league you're
participating in but it's something
conceivably that could happen which
seems like it is a different dynamic
than with some of these other vices
we're talking about but I guess my
question from a sort of conceptual
standpoint is does that really represent
a practical difference in how it should
be regulated well one of the things
obviously you're pointing through there
is that when you have sports betting you
really have to worry much more about the
integrity of the game I think with pro
sports the pro athletes are making so
much money they're probably not going to
that's not gonna be their enticement
referees let's face it the NBA have a
referee who did it yes and was fired
because of that so the NBA has that
clearly the organization that's got the
biggest stake in this and worrying about
it if the NCAA because you're paying you
we're not paying college athletes I mean
let's let's face it I mean they might be
getting the free scholarship and
education and things like that but
they're not being paid and so there's
really going to be how you try to keep
how the NCAA is going to handle this as
and the integrity of the game there it's
really gonna be a real problem and what
is the sort of dynamic in terms of
dealing with that I mean you make it
against the law you make it against the
policies of the organization you do that
stuff but it still sort of can happen
you would hope that you discover it when
it's happening but in terms of
preventing that is there anything really
beyond that that can be done well I mean
obviously the sports leagues it's
interesting the sports league I think
have the gall to be quite honest I think
I'll say the golf that they want a
percentage of the sports revenue that
the states are going to be taking in to
pay for integrity purposes which by the
way they already have to do anyway so I
think I think like the NFL and the NBA
and Major League Baseball have the gall
to say that they want a percentage of
the sports bet from from from the States
is outrageous as far as I'm concerned
but for the NCAA
have to really even now they're all
ready to tell cleats you can't bet if
you do you're gonna lose your
scholarships and things like that but I
think you're gonna have to do a lot lot
lot schools are going to have to spend a
lot more money worrying about the
integrity and who's going on campus and
in consulting with which it would be
trying to contact student athletes I'd
love to take a minute to talk a little
bit about one of the arguments that's
made often against the legalization of
both betting gambling betting on sports
and the lottery and that's an argument
which says that the activities of
particularly playing the lottery but
also to some degree gambling and betting
on sports are overwhelmingly being done
by people who actually don't really have
the money to lose and that that's a
particular argument when it comes to the
lottery that it preys on those who those
who actually are least equipped to lose
a few bucks here and there playing the
lottery and the sort of libertarian
argument or retort is often listen the
government is not your nanny the
government is going to try to raise its
revenue in the bet ways that at best
sees fit and that's that's sort of it
the counter to that often also is well
if it's not legal people will still be
doing the betting they're just going to
be doing it in sort of a black market
way but the truth is that black market
lotteries are not that big of a thing I
mean of course they exist but a state
sanctioned lottery is a very very
different thing where do you come down
sort of on that issue and really it's
more of a question of government power
and intervention right yes immediately
say with the laundry I think it's
probably true allow the instant tickets
where you see people scrapping tickets
and things like that there are certainly
people who should not be there and and
and the government one of the estimates
I've heard is that around 30 percent of
the players of lottery tickets by around
70 percent of the tickets so clearly the
government has
morale has a moral obligation to spend a
lot more money on compulsive gambling
and the problem that people have with
compulsive being with all right
again if the lotteries right now are
basically flat and so that's the other
reason why state governments are looking
at sports betting because sports betting
is clearly something it will be
brand-new in the area of sports betting
by the way only that is really a middle
class thing it is it you clearly for
instance the fantasy sports leagues
right now which by the way are going to
popping and being being trouble once
regular sports for family but they are
clearly middle class or upper middle
class phenomenon there are the people
who want to play those games so it
depends for instance it means like an
alcohol clearly the upper classes are
the ones that drink scotch
lower class people usually drink beer
and so there's a little bit of that
going on with gambling that there's
certain things certain gambling games go
for the lower classes and that's the
lottery there's no doubt about that
versus sports gambling would certainly
affect I mean I think that the age group
that would really be a lock would be
eighteen to twenty to thirty five maybe
males and gandu but will go on in
college campuses once you want you
legalize sports game do you think that
there should be a distinction made in
the law as these laws are developed
between in-person sports gambling and
online like is there enough of a
difference in the dynamics there that it
would make sense to regulate them as
sort of separately or differently I
would probably say you're 100 percent
because if you have to go in person it's
probably either going to be to a race
track which is what New Jersey wants
they want you to go the casinos or a
racetrack and they don't want to put it
online excuse the pun here but I think
Delaware's already raising the ante on
sports betting because they want to put
everything online and so now how do you
regulate sports gambling online and make
sure that you know that if you're saying
it 21 is the earliest age you can do it
how do you regulate that how do you have
you assure that people will will keep
their bets underwear although certain
ways you could probably
about what people are betting and how
much they're betting online just
probably one or more circumstances that
you found in person many we've been
speaking with Richard McGowan joining us
today from El Salvador's professor in
the Carroll school at Boston College
Richard thank you so much for talking to
us about this
it's great to be with you David
it's great to welcome to the program
today Erik Durkheim er who's a professor
of psychology at the University of
Virginia we are going to be talking
about some of the controversies that are
now very very prevalent in some enclaves
of the internet and not only there
including about genetics and environment
and IQ but I think maybe first just so
we're all on the same page let's talk a
little bit about the genesis of what we
now know is the modern IQ test what it
can tell us and sort of what it cannot
tell us well I mean the genesis of it if
that's where we're gonna start is back
at the turn of the 20th century it was
invented by French and American
investigators largely in the context of
first testing army recruits and later
testing immigrants in the United States
probably the concept of intelligence as
opposed to intelligence test themselves
date back a little bit further than that
to someone in Francis Galton was
Darwin's cousin as a matter of fact and
was a controversial figure but in many
ways an uncontested genius in the 18th
Victorian 1870s navies and I I think the
place to start with IQ is you commonly
hear people who either believe that IQ
is this deep dive into what a human
being is capable of on one hand and then
people on the other side who say that
it's meaningless and that it's just what
the IQ test measure or it's just a
measure of how much money your parents
make or something along those lines and
I think the important thing and thinking
clearly about IQ is steering a
reasonable course between those two
extremes
IQ is a is a measurable characteristic
of people yawn
any doubt if if you I mean there's a you
know a lot of technical stuff but if you
give people a series of mental tests of
almost any kind on average people who do
well on one mental test is are gonna do
well on other mental tests and if you
you know a slightly more sophisticated
way taking average across all those
mental tests you get an IQ score and
what that IQ score is for sure we can
talk about whether it's anything more
than this but what it is for sure is a
measure of how good someone's cognitive
functioning is right now at the time
they took tests it's it's a description
of someone like finding out how
depressed they are or anything else that
a psychologist might measure and I think
if you if you view IQ this way a measure
of how well somebody is capable of
thinking at the moment it's not really a
very controversial idea because anybody
can look around them and see that some
people are are functioning at a higher
level than others some people have
bigger vocabularies and can solve harder
problems and do better plans I mean we
all we all know that I think what makes
the idea controversial is this idea that
IQ test somehow measure this deep thing
called innate intelligence that it's
it's not just how well you're doing
right now but this inner thing that
you're born with that constrains how
well you possibly can do in the world
and I wouldn't I don't want to say
there's no evidence that that's true I
mean there are people sensible people
have done tried hard things to show that
that's true but it's certainly it's far
from obvious that that's true and it's
very very difficult show that it's true
can you talk a little bit about I'm sure
there's much more that could be said on
that but there's a lot that the sort of
follows from this that I want to use as
sort of our baseline for establishing
our conversation there is this idea that
iq maybe represents some kind of
universal measure of intelligence that's
independent of culture or geography or
what-have-you and then there's another
view that there is some test bias which
is that the test itself is biased
towards individuals from certain parts
of the world with certain education and
that it's not as universal as some might
point to can you give us an
understanding of that yeah I mean I
don't I don't think it's a question on
which there's an absolute answers
I think it's broadly true that among
modern people people who live in the
developed world certainly in North
American Europe and in large parts of
East Asia as well where people are
basically educated basically abstract
thinking oriented basically book
oriented the biases in IQ tests are in
fact barely small
I mean IQ didn't as far as that goes IQ
tests are much better than they were
when they were first created when they
were obviously biased and if it's really
not the case I don't think that IQ tests
are at least in obvious ways biased
against say or emeritus or something
like that
now another somewhat farther out part of
the IQ world is people who think it's
legitimate to wander out into
sub-saharan Africa somewhere with a IQ
test kit and find people who I've never
been to school or only a rudimentary
school had may or may not be illiterate
and and the whole culture of taking a
test on which you try to get the right
answer to get a high school
or just doesn't make any sense and I
think push that hard yes tests are
obviously biased and that's important
because there are people who actually do
that and take the results seriously
which i think is a huge mistake
so among most of us
I don't think test bias is a huge issue
in understanding why some people get
higher IQ scores than others fair enough
you've your work has shown that or claim
to show that the environment accounts
for about 60% of the IQ variance among
low-income children so let's start with
that sixty percent number question one
is what accounts for the variance of the
other forty percent uh well I mean
they're very broadly genetics though
well there there's a there are a lot of
things to say about that you have to be
very I Q like everything on any any
miserable difference you can measure in
people is to one extent or another
correlated with our genes and all that
says is that sort of where we start in
life and the biological input that we
become winds up correlated with where we
went end up it doesn't mean that there
are genes for IQ or per se or anything
like that
now when you when you talk about those
percentages those percentages are a very
very complicated thing because it's it's
it's you know we're talking about a
quantity that's called a heritability
that varies from zero to one and tells
you tells you within a lot of
complications about the proportion of
differences in people that are accounted
for by differences in our genes i one
way i like to think about it is
it tells you how much more similar we
would all be if we were all clones and
and it's easy to think when you start
thinking about these numbers that IQ or
any trade has a heritability and we do
science to find out if the heritability
of IQ is 60% or 70% or 40% or 20% and
that's wrong IQ doesn't have a
heritability the heritability of IQ
depends on the situation but you measure
it and it and that depends on how much
people very genetically and
environmentally
so in fact if you gave an IQ test to a
bunch of clones I mean that's not
possible in humans you know a huge set
of identical twins everybody exactly was
saying the heritability would be zero
because everyone is genetically the same
and differences in genes can't account
for everything so anyway coming back to
our study when people have computed
those heritability some twins in the
past it's been very common it's very
hard to get poor twins in twin studies
for a variety of reasons they don't
volunteer for the study of poor families
have better things to do and and we've
we found we really find it there there
is a large American twin study that
included a lot of twin children raised
in poverty and what we found in that
study is that among very poor children
the heritability of intelligence the
proportion that seemed to be accounted
for by genes was very very low as lower
than 40% it was close to 0% in the
poorest children and then as you proceed
up to through the middle class into the
upper middle class there weren't a lot
of rich people in this study genes
became more and more important accounted
for more and more of the variance we're
so by the time you got to the upper
middle class things are almost
completely reversed and that that
finding just by the way has replicated
quite well in the United States where we
have a lot of economic and educational
inequality not so much in Europe where
they have a better safety net but
that fits I think with a lot of common
sense thinking about intelligence which
suggests that it's bad environments are
much more important for intelligence
than good environments it's it's it's a
lot I don't mean to be flip about it but
it's a lot easier to make someone dumber
than it is to make him smarter because
things that go wrong are much more
important and what I think is what I
like about that finding is that it gives
us a way to take the overall genetics of
IQ seriously whereas at the same time
understanding the critical importance of
things like poverty and bad environments
and the negative effects that those can
have on children while they're growing
up
let's pause our conversation there we've
been speaking with Eric Durkheim ER
who's a professor of psychology at the
University of Virginia we'll continue
our conversation with him tomorrow we're
continuing our conversation with Eric
Durkheim ER who's a professor of
psychology at the University of Virginia
where I'd like to pick up our
conversation if we can is first to sort
of get into the topic of race and IQ
before we talk about the meaning and
causality question one is are there
observable differences in IQ measured by
race as race is understood in modern
Western society yep there are and can
you describe that in a little more
detail yeah so if you if you give an IQ
test to a sample of measure we'll talk
about the u.s. American blacks and
whites or or a test that is essentially
an IQ test even if it's not intended
quite as such like the SATs or something
like that blacks will score something
like two-thirds of a standard deviation
about 10 to 12 IQ points lower that's
just a fact
on average and of course the important
discussion is why that is right so my
immediate follow-up I mean given that so
we're working with the sort of same same
baseline of the data that a lot of
people who have become incredibly
interested in this topic over the last
three to five years start with my
immediate next question and you tell me
whether this is the correct next
question or whether there are
intermediate questions to look at is do
we have reason to believe that the that
the cause of those differences is race
itself uh well if you mean biological
race then no I by I believe strongly
that we don't I mean it certainly is
social aspects of race and the history
of slavery and discrimination let me in
some ways that's race but presuming you
mean race as a biological construct I
feel very strongly that it doesn't and
that it's in fact irresponsible for
people to speculate that it might be
it's and my strongest feeling about that
is that based on the kind of data that
we can generate in human beings it's
it's not it's not only that there's no
evidence that that's true oh that's the
case there is no evidence that that's
true it's also that there's no possible
evidence that it's true it's not like
we're waiting for somebody to complete a
study that's it's going to be decisive
well that was a maybe my next question
which is hypothetically what type of
evidence if you could imagine it would
tell us that IQ differences between
races are specifically because of race
is that even a possibility I mean here
here's the way I think that could turn
out to be true I mean and I don't and I
and my point is that this is very
unlikely to happen if if we summed and
what what doesn't exist even though IQ
is heritable like everything is ever
thing about people is heritable there
are no in the normal range
aside from Down syndrome and things like
that there are in the normal range the
difference between your IQ and mine
there are no known genetic mechanisms
that determine your IQ that oh well okay
this pretty you know David has genes XY
and Z and Erik has genes a B and C and
we know that it's always true that
people with X Y Z genes have higher IQs
that ABC genes and we especially if we
ever understood the mechanism because
you can see here's what X Y Z genes do
to your brain and enhance the neurons
etc etc etc and because of that people
with those genes are smarter pretty much
all the time not contingent on anything
else uh if that were true well then you
could find a group of people that had
those genes and a group of people that
didn't have those beans and say well the
difference between those groups seems
like it's caused by those gene I mean
and that might apply to American blacks
and whites and it might not but it's an
explained the difference between some
groups groups that have them in groups
that don't have but it's those
mechanisms that are exactly what's
missing all we know is that genes in
individuals are correlated with IQ at
the end of the day and we have
absolutely no reason why or how and
because of that we have no way of
knowing whether if the world changed you
know so if 200 years from now
slavery is finally far enough back in
the rearview mirror that it's not
affecting people anymore and
discriminate and Jim Crow and
discrimination - and all the racism that
still goes on today that's finally deep
in the past the the genetics of race
people have to have to say the
mechanisms of IQ are such that blacks
will still score low
on IQ tests and there's simply no way
there's simply no way to know that and
if you're just betting on the
probabilities there's no reason to think
like that something like that would ever
come out to be true you have to remember
that you know 120 years ago at the turn
of the century when IQ tests were first
coming online people from southern
Europe Italians and Greek people at
lower IQs and that man because those
were the people who were emigrating and
Jews for that matter and because those
were the people who were immigrating to
the United States who was a big deal and
people thought the exact same thing that
Wow though those people they have lower
IQs it must be because of their genes
and it's not that somebody's done a big
scientific experiment that showed oh no
no three people they're okay it's not
their genes after all it's just that
time has gone by and Greek immigrants
have recovered from whatever hardships
they were experiencing when they first
immigrated here and nobody thinks about
it anymore and in in the absence of any
other reason any reason to think
otherwise that that's what we should
expect to happen in the long run with
blacks and whites except of course the
what has been done to blacks over the
last 500 years in North America is is
far worse than what's been done to any
other group and it's gonna take more
these things don't change fast and I
think one of the problems is that these
kind of these kinds of deficits and
disadvantages change over a tiny period
that's the longer than an individual
human life
so we it's like watching the hour hand
on a clock you know and I think a big
part of the motivation for people who
think well god this has got to be
genetic is they've been looking at it
for 20 or 30 years and the gap hasn't
gotten it's gotten a little smaller but
it hasn't gotten all that much smaller
and that's what I wanted to ask you
about next I mean you've you've spoken
to
a variety of different people about this
issue I saw an interview you did with
stefan molyneux do you attribute bad
faith to the movement that wants to
explain IQ differences by saying they
are because of race or do you attribute
ignorance or this sort of short span of
time
that you're pointing out I can't I guess
I can't characterize everybody that
thinks that there are I mean one thing
I've become aware of and it'll happen
again
when this interview gets out on Twitter
I mean especially outside the
professional community there there are
just a lot of here in America people are
fascinated with race and for a lot of
people they're fascinated with race and
kind of a negative way and there are a
lot of racist people out there who just
want to believe that because it confirms
their their presuppositions about the
world in the in the professional world
that's more complicated I do know some
presumably professional people who I
think are motivated by racism on this
issue I know other people who you know I
think are motivated by a genuine
scientific impulse that there's this
persistent difference they want to
understand why it happens and and
especially in the you know in the in the
very contemporary world that I I find
there's a tendency on sort of the the
center-right if I can say it that way on
the academic center right to be it's
become so important to a lot of people
to not to give in to what they view as
the PC campus culture bla bla bla bla
bla that it's very important to them to
entertain seriously anything that seems
like a scientific hypothesis so when
somebody says well I'm a scientist and
I'm not a racist and I'm just so burly
investigating the possibility that the
IQ gap between the race
is scientific there are a lot of people
who feel a scientific responsibility to
take that idea seriously and I think it
I think I think it's wrong to do that
and I think they're making a mistake but
I don't think they're exactly racists in
doing it they're they're just putting
their commitment to academic freedom and
freedom of inquiry above their
importance of racist hypotheses and I
think that's a mistake but well I said
it I don't altima t think it's motivated
by racism and it they and and how the
balance of all those things work out
really differs from person to person
then in a way that's hard for me to
characterize broadly last thing I want
to touch on in the in the limited time
we have is the following
on the one hand you've said that it
could be a long time until the sort of
realities of humans on our planet change
such that this gap will be eliminated
you've also indicated that yes currently
the average intelligence for certain
races is higher and lower than for
certain others so my question is more of
a speculative one which is in the
immediate other than saying give it
another 400 years is there any
mathematical case that you have found is
the most effective or scientific case to
explain to those who seem convinced that
the gap is because of race innately to
sort of disabuse them of those beliefs
yeah well I think the the best way to
make that case is be a something called
the Flynn effect the Flynn effect is
something that was observed by the
Prospero psychologist Jim Flynn who
in what I think is a hilarious but also
correct turn of events Roseanne bars
reboot of her sitcom Roseanne has been
canceled by ABC just hours after she
tweeted just a horribly racist string of
messages Roseanne posted a comment
yesterday it feels like it's a week ago
because of how much has happened but
yesterday Roseanne posted a comment
about former Obama advisor Valerie
Valerie Jarrett on Twitter saying Muslim
Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes had a
baby equals VJ meaning Valerie Jarrett
in response to another Twitter comment
about Valerie Jarrett and of course
Valerie Jarrett happens to be black and
Roseanne references monkeys and as usual
her defenders say it's not racist monkey
isn't racist Planet of the Apes isn't
racist it's merely a coincidence that
Valerie Valerie Jarrett is black and
historically there is significant sort
of racist institutional history of
equating black people to monkeys but
it's a mere coincidence and of course
why are the people that are insulted as
monkeys very often black are they saying
it is literally the mere coincidence I'm
sarcastically referencing and Roseanne
later deleted the tweet but it was too
late just hours later ABC cancelled
Roseanne's show they put out a statement
which said in part that quote Rosen's
Twitter statement is abhorrent repugnant
and inconsistent with our values and we
have decided to cancel her show Roseanne
also later apologizing on Twitter saying
I apologized to Valerie Jarrett and to
all Americans I am truly sorry for
making a bad joke about her politics and
her looks I should have known better
forgive me my joke was in bad taste that
was the one of the first apologies later
she said she was tweeting on the sleep
medication ambien saying it was 2:00 in
the morning and I was ambien tweeting it
was Memorial Day too
I don't know how Memorial Day brings out
racist statement when you are on ambien
or what the connection a connection is
and of course obviously my question was
did AM B is she saying ambien made her
racist I mean I've taken ambien
when I'm traveling to try to adjust very
difficult to fall asleep with the jetlag
when you go to Europe for example I
didn't all of a sudden think black
people were monkeys nor nor did it occur
to me to start tweeting about it and it
is just fascinating for a few reasons
first of all and I'll get to I know that
people are aware that she has blocked me
because of my comments we'll get to that
in a second Roseanne's reboot made her
like a darling of the right
it was rebooted it initially got great
ratings Trump called roseanne to
congratulate her the right hail that is
finally a show just for sort of regular
traditional people despite the fact that
Roseanne is super rich and part Jewish
not the sort of down-home whatever she's
made out to be a good old gal or
whatever let's put that aside and this
has completely imploded in their faces
and I tweeted her about this I've
actually exchanged direct messages and
tweets with Roseanne before I tweeted to
Roseanne after the ambien thing which
we'll put up on the screen for you oh
man this is just the best Roseanne is
now defending her tweets by saying
ambien made her racist and Roseanne
almost immediately responding to me
saying no I didn't I blamed myself
stop lying yes I have had odd ambien
experiences on tweeting late at night
like many other people do I blame myself
okay it's just an explanation not an
excuse okay bully and then when I went
to respond she had sadly blocked me
Roseanne I don't even know where to
start with this right I mean politically
this is a woman who's off her rocker
right she has called Chelsea Clinton
Chelsea Soros Clinton she said George
Soros is trying to overthrow the US
government and she said that the CIA is
funding some kind of mind-control thing
all of this really really crazy stuff
but what I don't really understand here
is if you're not blaming ambien why do
you mention ambien and if the ambien had
a role to play did the ambien make you
think racist things that you wouldn't
normally
we think or did the ambien merely lower
your inhibitions to the point where you
were willing to tweet the racist things
that you always think it's like when Mel
Gibson was pulled over that time and he
was immediately going on unprovoked
anti-semitic rants and he said the
problem was that he was drunk and of
course the question is is he saying
alcohol makes you anti-semitic or it
merely makes you willing to say the
anti-semitic things that you always
think for what it's worth the
manufacturer of ambien has put out a
statement saying that racism is not a
known side effect of ambien so so we've
heard that and I you know I don't know
is there more to say pat about my
exchange with her or is that it is that
basically all we need to say well it's
interesting that she says that you're a
bully hours after calling Valerie
Jarrett a mix between the Planet of the
Apes and the Muslim Brotherhood I mean
can't really make that argument in that
case yeah I don't really have a
reputation for bullying people but okay
that's what she chose to say to me let's
talk about sort of the firing and the
implications here I want to put up an
assessment that is 100% a similar to
mine and it's from another none other
than Dave Rubin who at one point was
using Roseanne's studio for his show
Dave Rubin tweeted yesterday Roseanne
exercised her free speech and ABC
decided to end their free association
now it's on you to either support her or
not boycott ABC or not or share your own
opinion as a free person or not once
again freedom is messy but it's better
than the alternative
and I agree in a sense it's not about
free speech at all and that there's no
question or concern at all about free
speech or censorship here right Rosen
said outrageous things and her employer
fired her period she doesn't need the
money she's worth like 80 million
dollars and my only real concern is that
she has really messed things up for the
entire production staff at ABC right the
people running the cameras the people
doing the tech work they don't have 80
million dollars like Rosanna do they
lose their jobs now because of Rosen's
racist tweet hopefully some of those
employees are part of a union and maybe
our guaranteed money for the first
season or whatever no matter whether the
show is canceled or not
hopefully I I don't really know the
answer to that
and of course Donald Trump I don't even
know that we're not gonna put it up on
the screen to trump did say something
about how he never received a call from
Bob Iger from ABC when ABC criticized
him but Bob Iger called Valerie Jarrett
or something like that the only
surprising thing about any of this is
that anybody was surprised by it because
of Roseanne's very very long history of
tweeting bizarre and depraved conspiracy
theories and generally just insulting
things but I think it was a big win in
the battle of ideas Pat I mean listen
everybody got to say what they wanted to
say a corporation was able to make the
business decision that they felt was
right for them government didn't
interfere period right I mean a major
win in the battle of the free exchange
of ideas yeah everything worked out okay
I guess I'm just surprised ABC decided
to have her back on to reboot the sitcom
knowing that Roseanne has a history of
doing this saying racist things on
Twitter she actually made a very similar
remark about Susan Rice another former
Obama official and another black woman
comparing hurts who will monkey as well
yes so you know they could have
preempted some of this at least it's
like it's not like this is a new thing
for Mose Ann that's why I'm not going
around patting ABC on the back saying
wow they've they've just done this
amazing thing they made a business
decision it is a that is exactly what it
is if this were good for business if
people weren't outraged but they said
you know what it's so great that
someone's finally out there saying that
valerie jarrett is like a monkey in some
way they wouldn't have fired her right
they would have said hey Roseanne said
what she wanted to say on her Twitter we
employ her to produce the Roseanne show
or act in the Roseanne show whatever
this is merely all about optics and
you're right Pat which is that this is
not shocking this is another one in a
long history of these types of comments
from Roseanne so I think that the the
decision made by ABC was the right one
although they made it for business
decisions not from not for business
reasons not for moral or ethical reasons
and that's completely something that
they can do send me your thoughts about
the entire Roseanne thing I'm on Twitter
at D Pakman and the show is on Twitter
at David Pakman show things are starting
to get really bad for Donald Trump jr.
the FBI now has secret wiretaps
Spanish police of a conversation between
Alexander tortion who's an official of
Russia's central bank who we've
discussed before because he was part of
that story involving Russia funneling
money through the NRA to the Trump
campaign and these wiretaps that the FBI
has reportedly led to a meeting between
Donald Trump jr. and Alexander tortion
oh lordy there are tapes at least some
of them and Jose Grenda who has been
investigating Spanish organized crime
for a very long time was asked about
whether there's concern that tortion had
meetings with Donald Trump jr. and
Grenda said quote mr. Trump's son should
be concerned and this is now starting to
get beyond anything we could call
innocent coincidences the lead Russian
guy who was revealed by the McClatchy
investigation which we interviewed
vivica Nova Novack about as being a
primary player in the funneling of
Russian funds to the Trump campaign
through the NRA which of course would be
against the law met with Donald Trump
jr. and there are wiretaps related to
that meeting that tortion had with Trump
jr.
so let's go through it layer by layer
number one the fact that the FBI has
these wiretaps implies tortion is of
interest to the FBI which means that any
combination of the meeting with Trump
jr. to the funneling of money through
the NRA might now be part of Robert
Moeller's investigation number two
Spain is now involved with this and is
cooperating with the FBI that's another
indication as to the size and scope of
this entire thing number three the idea
that this entire Muller investigation is
almost over who believes that when Spain
just entered the proceedings over the
last couple of months very difficult to
believe
and then lastly how far have the goal
posts moved right at some point and it
seems like ancient history at this point
the Trump campaign said no one in the
campaign had any contact with Russians
it seems hilarious to even think back to
that at this point Jeff Sessions said it
and Donald Trump said it and everybody
said it
who's even talking about that is the
standard anymore the discussion now is
what of the contact was criminal if any
was there obstruction to try to hide
that contact we never met with Russians
became there were meanings but they
weren't about anything - there were
meetings about helping our campaign but
they never actually did end up helping
the campaign and now it's becoming hey
listen there was all sorts of stuff
going on but none of it was actually
against the law
and if it was Hillary would have done
the exact same thing anyway or she
already did and then the last point I
want to make about this is Jose Grenda
the Spanish investigator saying that
Trump jr. should be concerned
Jose Grenda has been a major
investigator in Spain of organized crime
he's not a guy that you want to mess
with he's made his career investigating
organized crime and corruption in Spain
he's saying merely on the basis of what
he has found that Donald Trump jr.
should be worried the response from
trumpets they always have one here it is
deep state right I mean deep state if
ever there was proof that there was an
international conspiracy to take down
Donald Trump over nothing more than a
witch-hunt it's that now even the
Spanish are involved so obviously it's a
deep state conspiracy that we need to
expose here stunning that this is going
on and this isn't even the only story
from the weekend like this we also
learned during our long weekend that
days before his inauguration in January
of 2017
Donald Trump's personal lawyer well days
before Trump's inauguration Trump's
personal lawyer Michael Cohen met with
another Russian at Trump Tower so that's
gonna have to be a story for another day
maybe but I think what's clear is that
this was supposed to be over by last
Thanksgiving if you believe these people
clearly it's not going to be over
anytime soon I've been really struggling
with whether or not I should be calling
this story Trump cocked by Korean
leaders because we've talked about how
use of the term by us is obviously
completely satirical it's making a joke
out of how the right uses the word but
it still arguably might be better
not to use the word even as a joke right
because it's mere use could suggest that
it has a legitimate place in political
vocabulary and and I don't think that it
does so I've said it once and we'll
simply say from now on that Trump has
been yet again embarrassed by his total
failure on the North Korean summit last
week we learned totally not surprisingly
that the Trump North Korea summit was
canceled and it was canceled as it was
becoming more and more clear that it
just wasn't going to go the way that
Donald Trump wanted and of course any
fool would have known that months ago
and then over the long weekend we
learned that it's possible that the
summit might be back on but if it is it
would be the result at least partially
of a kim jeong-hoon moon jae-in North
South Korean respective leaders surprise
summit the second one between the North
and South Korean leaders and very
clearly if there is going to be any real
sort of substantive advancement with the
North Korea situation it's moon jae-in
who has been doing the real work here
and we don't know the full
subject-matter of the talks that they
had yet but what we do know is that one
of the topics was reinstating the summit
which with Donald Trump which Trump
canceled last week and the White House
did confirm according to Sarah Huckabee
Sanders that the summit might be back on
and yet again moon jae-in a professional
diplomat who would be responsible in
great part for the summit being back on
Donald Trump tweeting we are having very
productive talks with North Korea about
reinstating the summit which if it does
happen will likely remain in Singapore
on the same date June 12th and if
necessary will be extended beyond that
date do you think that Trump realizes
that the dynamic is that he's the sort
of childish buffoon who understands
nothing and just digs this hole and then
in comes moon jae-in as the adult in the
room to clean up Trump's mess and people
are taking this totally cartoonish and
bogus sort of point of view about Trump
getting a Nobel Peace Prize if this
happens
if this happens it will be despite Trump
not because of him and if anybody here
would get a medal of any kind wouldn't
it obviously be the South Korean
president moon J and I actually read
online one of the funniest sort of post
hoc rationalizations of why Trump really
is the hero here and the argument I'm
you'll have to excuse that I'm not able
to super eloquently summarize some of
these trumpets right arguments but the
argument as I understood it was Trump
canceled the original summit
specifically to allow for the second
secret summit and moon jae-in coming in
and sort of playing the good cop to then
set kim jeong-hoon
up to go to the rescheduled summit with
trump more ready to negotiate or
something like that like it's a
completely impossible to disprove
hypothesis and and all along that sort
of been the case right the idea that
trumps tweets are really what put this
thing in motion
if you believe that there's really no
conversation for us to have watching Fox
and Friends and tweeting is the real
hard work of the North Korea summit and
moon jae-in is the guy who's the puppet
or the placeholder I mean we're just not
going to be able to have any really
substantive conversations with people
who believe that but a very slight sort
of reframing exposes this as Trump the
great negotiator sitting at home
canceling the talks while moon jae-in
actually gets things done and I think
that that's that's the most accurate
point of view here and this actually
carries some risk the the entire
exclusion of Trump if indeed Trump is
going to be excluded and moon jae-in
making progress with Kim jong-un
actually carries a lot of political risk
because we know Trump right and on
principle alone I can imagine a
situation where the North and the South
negotiate something they come to some
kind of agreement right and Trump says
he's not going to support it he's not
going to be part of it the United States
is not going to be part of it because
Trump wasn't part of the negotiation and
his ego and his narcissism would no
doubt make it possible that he would do
that so I actually think that the the
best path forward is
we all know that moon jaein is doing the
work here we all know that it will be
American in South Korean career
diplomats who were doing the work here
it might be a good idea to keep Trump
involved at least on paper to placate
him and make him believe that he did a
big boy and that he's going to get a
reward because I think otherwise there's
a good chance that he says I I'd listen
I wasn't involved in this
maybe we're not gonna be part of this
thing whatsoever yeah well I think moon
jae-in has been doing an excellent job
because he'll occasionally credit Donald
Trump he complements them he can't
really it's just a way to keep Trump out
of it that way he doesn't have to send
out those little rocket man tweets
anymore and moon jae-in and Kim Jong
moon can actually get some progress done
yeah I when I see moon jae-in talk about
you know any anything positive about
Trump's involvement in this it seems
like it is sort of that placating of
Trump that I'm suggesting is somewhat of
a good idea so we'll see what ultimately
happens I guess maybe the summit is back
on possibly we don't really know at this
point but maybe by tomorrow at this time
we will Fox News host Shepard Smith
completely dismantled Donald Trump's spy
gate lies yesterday and this Friday on
audience questions we're gonna cover
what would it take for Fox News to turn
on Donald Trump and when we say that we
mean aside from the occasional voices of
reason of Shep Smith less frequently
Chris Wallace and one time I was it just
one time Neil Cavuto I think it was one
time that Neil Cavuto said something
that made sense
one thing that Shep Smith has been doing
it's great to be joined today by Douglas
Lane who's the publisher of the critical
theory imprint zero books a podcaster
and youtuber and the author of several
novels most recently his critically
acclaimed novel bash bash revolution
which came out in March of this year
which we will get to it's so great to
have you on you know we you like we have
been following the pseudo-intellectual
ism movement that has really become
extraordinarily popular over the last
several years and I think it's important
to understand the movement to go back
beyond just the last sort of several
years where do you really pinpoint as as
the sort of origin of what we now see as
pseudo intellectual ISM like how far
back does this phenomena go oh well I
mean if you want to go all the way back
it goes to the previous pre-socratic you
know rhetorician x'
the you know the Sophos if people who
think that argument sounding good and
being rhetorically effective or better
or just as good anyway as sound
arguments um but as far as the new kind
of classical liberal anti social justice
warrior movement with people like dave
rubin and jordan peterson and even sam
harris to a degree it's it's really
tough to say that for me actually win
that exactly started certainly before
the election of Trump there's been a
move to critique the last as being
regressive to critique the left as
allergic to debate and sometimes that's
not entirely wrong sure but but the the
problem is that by becoming victims
themselves of this regressive left they
stopped being interested in actually
having those debates and they're just
sort of scoring easy points off of these
incidents where young leftist usually or
academics will you know duck out of
debate or claim to
that rigorous debate would be offensive
or something and so they do the same
thing but in Reverse
but yeah I would say that 2014 might be
the beginning somewhere around there
where you start to see this building up
of what I'll just call an
anti-intellectual right but but that or
an anti social justice warrior right
certainly one of the things I've
experienced when talking about this is I
will sometimes and you know you
mentioned some names and I now I'm
increasingly careful not to unless I'm
offering sort of like a specific
criticism of a particular idea because
most of the feedback I get from the
audience is basically arguing about
whether the specific individuals I
mentioned are or aren't intellectuals
and I feel that that's actually a
distraction from what the issue really
is I'm more concerned with the pseudo
intellectualism of the movement that has
been built around the individuals and
less so about the sort of intellectual
credentials of any one particular person
I'm curious whether you agree or whether
you think the focus actually should be
on the intellectual credentials of any
particular individual yeah no I totally
agree and actually you know I'm not
doubting the credentials of say Jordan
Peterson right I mean he's a professor
he has a he's a clinical psychologist he
has his level of expertise I'm sure he's
more educated about Union psychology
than I am and I don't want to impugn his
reputation as a professor I think anyone
who is a public intellectual I might be
tempted to kind of become a pseudo
intellectual because the market drives
you to simplify your message to find
what communicates well and to placate
and you know comfort your audience so
whenever you're not looking at difficult
questions or avoiding debates within
either internally or with a foe you know
an ideological opponent you're probably
engaging in some sort of pseudo
intellectual ism you're probably using
rhetorical arguments when you should be
you know thinking
I've made the analogy that some of what
makes these pseudo intellectual ideas
appealing to individuals who sort of
follow them and start to espouse and
parrot them is similar to what makes
conspiracy theories appealing to people
sometimes which is that there is some
way in which having a seemingly
straightforward and supposedly objective
explanation of how and why something
happened or how and why something is the
way that it is is in a way more
comforting than acknowledging the
significant gray area that exists in
most areas of sort of human existence as
a species on our planet and and while of
course the pseudo intellectualism stuff
is not conspiracy theories I'm not
saying that that some of the psychology
underlying its appeal has cross over
cross over do you what do you think of
that do you think there's something
there I needed yeah absolutely I think
that actually one of the common traits
of I like to call them the anti social
justice warrior personalities they're
part of an industry of media industry
that's risen up one of the common tropes
is this trope that the difficulties that
we are experiencing say in our family
life you know in the family in America
is in crisis that this is due to bad
actors this is due to like say for
instance hysterical feminists and then
that that movement itself is due to a
conspiracy a conspiracy by Marxists to
undermine Western civilization so you
can find I don't forget post modernists
as well
right well post-modernism right as well
which is again just a you know a cover
ideology for the true evil of Marxism I
happen to be what I call a wannabe
Marxist which means that I've read Marx
on crime struggling to understand his
work as deeply as I can and I do think
that he has a very powerful critique of
capitalism and the structure of our
society around class lines
I am particularly interested in and kind
of combating this conspiracy theory in
the anti social justice warrior industry
for me that's the most important thing
that they're doing and that's for two
reasons one is that it's wrong and it's
red baiting and it needs to be combated
but the other reason is it because every
time they do that it gives a Marxist
like myself an opportunity to correct
them and to talk about what marks
actually wrote and to kind of push my
own propaganda there so I think that's
the most example actually because one of
the sort of trends that I'm seeing is
that the this movement however it is
that we describe it in whatever borders
we sort of assigned to it is actually
very effective at creating no-win
situations for their would-be opponents
in the sense that they set up scenarios
where if I is someone on the left for
example say listen there is an anti free
speech element on the left but I think
that it's very small I'm immediately
interrupted in its oh so you admit that
it exists right and then that's sort of
where the conversation follows and it
appears as a sort of some pseudo
vindication the the other the only other
way is to sort of deny that there's any
element of truth to it which is not
actually authentically what I think and
they've really set it up very well to be
able to say either way whether you
accept that they're right or whether the
whether you deny it you fall into this
sort of caricature of what they're
criticizing and I wonder if you have any
idea how to sort of circumvent that I
don't know the only I can think of doing
is trying to get them to live up to
their own rhetoric and propaganda and
the way their own self conception you
know Jordan Peterson can be quite
eloquent about defending free speech and
how important it is to be able to
articulate ideas and talk together in
public to figure out what we should do
as a society and he's not wrong I mean
when he talks about that
he's compelling um and but he doesn't do
it and I want to give you my own
particular example yeah I know about
this and I think it'll
interesting yeah so back in December of
last year I emailed Jordan Peterson's
publicist and asked for an interview
with Petersen telling them that we are a
critical theory imprint out of the UK
and that I wanted to discuss Nietzsche
and Marx with him and I gave him a few
other details I gave her his publicist a
few other details they gave me a date
they said sure what's make this happen
along the right around the time when his
book is coming out so you know had it
down for January 24th I was very excited
I announced it on Facebook and on
Twitter and all of that and I have to
say there were elements of the left
people who I knew and people who at
least I knew of who were very critical
of me for even giving Peterson a
platform but I insisted you know that we
had to you know engage with the right
that we couldn't just think that we
could socially shame ordy platform away
bad ideas and that we should engage them
so this was scheduled his team canceled
right after or right around the time
that the Kathy Newman interview happened
and that the reason they canceled was
because after that Kathy Newman
interview in which by the way I think
she did a particularly poor job of
engaging him because she misrepresented
his ideas in real time I mean not that
his ideas are great but you don't and
you don't have to misrepresent them you
just have to engage them but in any case
they cancelled and shortly after that
you know they promised to reschedule but
they canceled shortly after that he went
on to a Rogen and said no Marxist would
ever debate him Rogen Aston you you know
have you ever talked to these crazy
people you know what have you ever heard
their side of the story what do they say
and he said well no they don't debate me
they did they don't wanted to be they
never asked me and that was when I
decided well wait a minute there you
know I have to intervene somehow so I
started tweeting at him and saying hey
we have a you know an interview plan
you're not you know you're not telling
the truth you know rule eight what about
rule eight always speak the truth I mean
we correct you I know you might be
mistaken here but so then then has
teamed shortly after that not too long
after that just canceled altogether
saying there would never be a time for
us to talk and so now I don't know if
that was in response to my tweets I
would tend to think knock I just tend to
think you know he was getting bigger and
bigger and bigger and he started going
on his world tour and and they just
cleared the board of all the smaller
shows so but in any case I said hey wait
you know we had an agreement before you
know this isn't like a new request
you're treating this like it's a new
request that they didn't write back to
me and then recently on Reddit he did
this ask me anything
I'm not exactly sure what to call it you
know but you people have so many
questions she read it and he responded
on Reddit and one of the questions asked
is why are you ducking Douglas Lane why
haven't you debated Douglas Lane you
know you say no Marxist wants to debate
you but he invited you want to show and
you cancelled so how can you say that
and he gave a kind of angry response
it's like I'm not obligated to talk to
just anybody who asks and you know I
don't know who Douglas Lane is and I
never heard about this and so ok so he
didn't hear about it from his publicist
I believe that and he's not obligated to
talk to me but now by his own rule he is
obligated to stop saying that no marks
this one right and I'm gonna be watching
to see if he continues to say that if I
had the resources I'd make a little
movie like Roger and me what join
Pearson I just follow him trying to get
that interview and mica you know and
Michael Moore chased down the head of
General Motors yes to talk to him so I
would do that with Peterson if I if I
had the resources but I don't had too
many hands or things to do but I will
pursue him on social media I guess and
and try to hold him to his own rule rule
8 which is always tell the truth
and now we know that he knows that
there's a Marxist who wants to debate it
let's pause our conversation there were
with Douglas Lane and we are going to
continue the conversation with him on
tomorrow's program we're continuing our
conversation with Douglas Lanie's the
publisher of the critical theory imprint
zero books podcaster youtuber author of
several novels including most recently
bash bash revolution which we will get
to shortly Douglas what's your sense of
when it comes to fighting pseudo
intellectual ism and not that
necessarily the individuals but the
ideas what's the best way to engage some
of the people that hear one of these
pseudo intellectual memes and then they
start to integrate it into their sort of
normal repertoire of debate and
discussion what's the best way to take
the ideas head-on and challenge them you
know I I happen to like bring a prop to
answer that question and this is a
Christopher Lashes book the culture of
narcissism and what I think the best way
to to I think the best way to go about
combatting someone like Peterson is to
first of all point out that there are
left critics who make similar but not
identical arguments to his that we
should engage with and that we should
take on and talk about and and I think
Christopher lash will be that kind of
critic I mean he was writing in the 70s
and 80s and 90s he's long dead now but a
lot of what he said about the crisis of
in of the family and its critiques of
liberal modernity and his concerns about
the American culture kind of are echoed
in Peterson's talk and I mean Peterson's
much more shallow thinker and that's why
it's a good idea to point out that not
only can we engage with Peterson but we
have our own critics of these phenomena
these problems and so that's what I
would suggest people do is because it
doesn't go run the risk I'm curious
whether that runs the risk of you know
Peterson likes to insist that he is not
an all right guy and that his ideas are
not fundamentally right wing ideas and
that's one of the defenses he uses
actually when he's critique doesn't that
risk allowing him to get away with that
even more when it's often sort of a
distort
in terms of the solutions because I feel
like you're right that there are lots of
other people on left and right who
identify similar problems to the ones he
identifies but the solutions is often
where there's a difference well I'm not
sure about how important it is to peg
him as alt right yeah I don't think it
is that important but it'sit's because
it's often a topic of discussion I guess
I bring it up yeah yeah I mean I I think
that more important than pegging him is
all right is to create a situation where
his ideas are not the only ones out
there and not the only ones resonating
with people who might be feeling
pressures around say employment or
family trouble or coming of age I mean I
think that's a very big part of his
appeal is that you've got young men in
particular who are having difficulties
maybe finding a job and certainly
finding themselves as a transition from
being kids to adults and Peterson's
giving them not only a way to to try to
think about doing that but also people
to blame for their own problems
and if you can give them a way to
understand their situation that's a
little deeper that might cut against his
appeal so I like developing our own
critiques putting forward our own ideas
and being willing to take on
difficulties within our own ideology I
think of some there really are some some
problems in on the left right now the
fact that Trump won is not just a
symptom of how bad the Rust Belt is or
how bad certain segments of Americans
are but also how there's a crisis in
liberal politics and we've lost our way
to it to an extent and we need to
rediscover our mission and those others
need to be eloquent though right I mean
a lot of it is packaging and PR and the
presentation and so even if we identify
competing ideas or similar critiques
that maybe approach solutions
differently you need someone who can do
what Peterson does as well
well that's you right I got this show
you've got you've got no but seriously I
mean there's a cult of personality
element to it that should not be
understated yeah okay that's true and I
don't know exactly what to do about that
and the the thing about that is that
doesn't just happen on the right and it
doesn't it doesn't happen quite as often
on you know for liberal political shows
like say this one or the majority or for
no one's doing you know setting up an
altar to Sam Seder right but but it does
happen online some it happens to anyone
who comes along and says hey I have a
way for you to make sense of your life
and like I think if Peterson in
particulars being kind of a similar
character to Terence Mckenna who was you
know totally different ideologically but
it had a similar kind of appeal to
people because they could turn to
McKenna who has some wild ideas crazy
ideas but he also spoke well and
developed a little cult of personality
around himself and and you know it's
like a pop star they also have they
develop fan bases right so I'm not sure
how to deal with that exactly
I know that you know we did we don't we
do it sometimes on the left I mean Noam
Chomsky is a hero to a lot of people
he's it's unlikely up star so yeah I
don't know exactly what to do about that
I mean just don't be too allergic to it
but be aware of the problem let's talk a
little bit if we can to talk about to go
from a real life dystopia maybe to one
that pseudo fictional I guess your
latest book bash bash revolution yeah it
is it is dystopian it relates to a whole
that one up sure by all means yeah tell
us a little bit I mean what how do you
describe the book sorry I lost you there
is no problem I mean how did you
conceive of the book how did you
describe how do how would you describe
the book to people well okay so the book
was written for two reasons one is that
my son is very good at super smash
brothers melee he's in college now but
when I started it out he was younger and
and he could always beat me at super
smash brothers melee so I decided I
wanted to write a novel it was like a
wish fulfillment novel where the
middle-aged dad could win and the only
way I could think of doing it is that he
would get help from an AI so that was
part of the reason I wrote the book but
that's not actually the major plot
points in the book it's about trying to
conceive of a way to overcome capitalism
and it's sort of a thought experiment
novel where I set up a situation where
with help from an from artificial
intelligence a gang of gamers save the
world by overcoming capitalism but along
the way lose their identities and lose
their sense of connectedness and one of
them the main character starts out the
novel resisting being part of the new
economy the revolution but what's called
the gamecube economy and so it's written
from this point of view of at the center
against the very thing that's stopping
society from being destroyed by the
trump administration and the nuclear
Armageddon and all of that so that's the
plot of that then that's a summary of
bash mass revolution so this is like a
very practical question but I've not yet
gotten a good answer to it and since
you're in the genre maybe you can tell
me what is the difference between
[Music]
the david pakman show at david
pakman.com things are truly genuinely
honestly not going well for Donald
Trump's personal attorney Michael Cohen
you probably remember that the FBI
raided his office and his hotel room and
I believe his condo as well not long ago
and law enforcement collected a ton of
documents during that raid a couple of
months ago and the government has turned
over nearly 4 million seized documents
so far - Michael Cohen's attorneys to
figure out is there privileged
information in any of these 3.7 million
documents and some of the documents that
the FBI found had been shredded and the
latest news is that the FBI is now
piecing together the shredded documents
and of course they're not doing this by
hand there are now computer programs
that can do this and at this point it
has gotten so insane that Trump's
attorneys attorneys are working around
the clock reviewing the four million
documents that the FBI has given them
and not only are there unshredded
documents and shredded documents which
we'll talk about in a second there are
also hard drives and thumb drives and
many many Blackberry phones so it's an
endless sort of treasure trove of
possible evidence of crimes and
originally Cohen's team was given until
June 15th to go over the nearly 4
million documents his lawyers are
understandably saying we need like way
way way more time to do this so I want
to focus in for now since it could be a
while until we actually learn more about
the contents of these documents about
the meaning of these shredded documents
and I understand you hear shredded
documents and many people think you
shred documents to hide stuff not
necessarily right I mean attorneys do
shred documents regularly for non
sketchy reasons but yeah if I'm the FBI
I'm looking very very closely at the
document
that michael cohen has shredded and
former FBI analyst asha ranga tweeted
about this quote i've watched people
pieced together shredded documents it's
amazing this is not going to end well
for the defense and former prosecutor
renato Mariotti also on twitter saying
federal prosecutors are piecing together
page papers shredded by michael cohen
that is bad news for him and one of the
funniest things about all of this is
that most lawyers have moved to what's
called crosscut shredding like you might
remember sometimes seeing vertical strip
shred shredders right this is where you
run a page through it and it shreds a
document into these strips those are
easier to reconstruct with the software
that now is available but most lawyers
now have moved to crosscut crosscut not
crush crosscut shredders which read in
multiple directions according to stormy
Daniels attorney Michael avenatti Cohen
had the old strip shredders that he was
using a transcript from his interview
with CNN has Jake Tapper saying let me
ask you a question
federal prosecutors say they're putting
together papers that have been shredded
by Michael Cohen do you know anything
about those papers and Michael avenatti
responding yesterday from what I've
gathered Michael Cohen was so cheap he
didn't invest in a crosscut shredder
which would have made it impossible for
investigators at Quantico forensic
specialists at Quantico to refabricate
or reconstitute these documents
evidently he had a different type of
shredder so they're in the process of
going through it from what I heard in
court today if true it is truly stupid
Watergate and I don't think I have to
remind anybody that if indeed the
shredded documents were related to what
the FBI is looking into and the
shredding took place after Michael Cohen
knew that the FBI was looking into it
that's the possible crying a crime of
destruction of evidence so it is really
not looking good for Cohen right now
well I mean come on Michael Cohen can't
afford a crosscut shredder his three
clients right one is Sean Hannity who
apparently gave him ten bucks at a party
once and that's it and the other is
Donald Trump who never pays his legal
bills and remember Cohen had to pay for
the story me Daniels hush money so ya
can't afford that
apparently we can't expect him to get
that fancy shredder make Maga not make
America great again
my attorneys getting arrested one
possibility also make America great
again no it's making attorneys get
attorneys I like both as much better
yeah not good for michael cohen
indictment when i think probably pretty
soon let's talk about Jill Stein as most
of you know I've been saying that Jill
Stein's campaign stunk from the get-go
and every time I say it people get mad
people cancel memberships people send me
angry messages but you know that I don't
sugarcoat my views on the show if I'm
going to say something that will anger
people I'm okay with that as long as
it's what I actually believe and that
has been sort of the guiding principle
on the show the latest with Jill Stein
is that there seems to be something
really weird going on with those
millions of dollars that Jill Stein
raised to pay for a recount of the 2016
presidential election in some key swing
states and from the beginning I was
asking number one from a legal
standpoint can Jill Stein demand or
trigger a recount for elections that she
definitely didn't win in other words
does she have standing to request or
demand or force a recount in a state
where either Donald Trump or Hillary
Clinton won I don't know what the answer
was to that but it ended up being merely
academic because it never moved forward
and from day one it stunk to high heaven
that Jill Stein after appearing at an
event in Russia with Michael Flynn and
Vladimir Putin immediately dismissed the
possibility that Russia made any
attempts to influence the 2016 election
but immediately started raising millions
of dollars for these nebulous recounts
that it wasn't even clear whether she
could get started because of standing
issues but she raised seven million
dollars from people who wanted the
recounts in those few states it has been
about a year and a half the Stein
campaign has not filed an FEC report
since September of 2017 it's been almost
a year and the campaign said about a
month and a half ago that they have only
nine hundred and thirty two thousand
dollars in recount funds left where did
the other six million dollars go
how did Jill Stein and her campaign
spend six million dollars in 16 months
and why did they stop filing reports
about that spending and The Daily Beast
reached out to Jill Stein's attorney
jonathan Abadi who said well you know
the recount effort is continuing first
of all I want to know what specific
realistic recount efforts are underway
how is the money being spent for
furthering those recount efforts
Jill Stein's campaign spokesperson says
that there still could be a recount and
that the Stein campaign is also bringing
another challenge regarding inspecting
voting software that was used in some
states I'm having a very hard time
believing that any of this stuff is
actually going to happen and bigger
picture we need her campaign held
accountable for not reporting their
spending right the FEC has already
warned Jill Stein about about this there
has been a half a year of spending
unaccounted for that the FEC wrote to
her about in May and then of course this
goes fundamentally to jill Stein's
honesty or lack thereof her campaign
made the promise that any leftover money
the roughly 160 1,000 donors who donated
would get to decide how the money is
used not only has that not happened 6/7
of the money is gone six million of the
seven million dollars is gone without a
single recount and without actually
being accounted for and I'm not patting
myself on the back I and many others
warned people about donating Curt Eiken
Walled warned people about donating Jill
Stein has been refusing to cooperate
with the Russia investigation she has
not filed the appropriate reports about
the spending I'm not surprised at all by
this yeah I mean it's a little bit hard
to believe that they just took the money
and ran though because this was all done
in public right they were asking for a
recount money you know out in the public
square so that would be quite brazen to
do don't you think I mean it's not like
they're doing some underground secretive
thing where they're trying to come up
with some Ponzi scheme here we don't
know what they're doing right we don't
know what they're doing because six
million has been spent and they haven't
filed any spending reports
September and we don't know what's going
on with the recounts which they simply
claim are continuing it's almost the
next election right it's almost November
of 2018 now if you don't like the story
if you don't like me doing this story
don't tell me I'm a Democratic shill
because I'm not don't tell me I'm a
Russia bot and I don't mean that's
actually that I should clarify what I
mean by that that has a couple of
meanings right now I don't mean that
people are going accusing me of being a
Russian bot what I mean is a sort of
focus only on Russia and believe every
single story on critically about Russian
because I'm not tell me specifically
what I'm wrong about on the facts
regarding what Jill Stein said and what
Jill Stein and her campaign have or have
not done and then we can have a
conversation about that but don't just
riddle me with ad hominem x'
on social media because you don't like
the fact that i'm talking about this but

david pakman show subreddit has been
titillated and abuzz
ever since yesterday's Roseanne Barr
incident where she called me a bully on
social media just hours after getting
fired by ABC one of the discussions on
the subreddit is exactly that Rosanna
calls David Pakman a bully on Twitter
Roseanne you have now officially crossed
the line we'll just wait until the next
segment where I talk about what FoxNews
did with regard to my little spat with
Roseanne Barr on Twitter very exciting
yeah
if Rose Ann's first comment about
Valerie Jarrett didn't get her fired by
ABC this certainly would have yes apps
of calling me a bully on Twitter would
have been grounds for Bob Iger
immediately firing her also on the David
Pakman show subreddit this is from two
nights ago Sean Hannity is losing it
tonight this guy is insane talk about a
bunch of snowflakes yet when I saw this
I actually tuned in to Fox News because
I was so curious and this was in the
midst of the Roseanne Barr thing the
revelations about the michael cohen
shredded documents i mean just every
possible thing going completely wrong
Trump totally cocked by the North and
South Korean leaders and Hannity was
totally losing it and we know that
Hannity and Trump have a special
relationship of sorts and it was not a
good day in Hannity Ville two nights ago
even crazier that night you would say
because Hannity is losing it all the
time it was particularly unhinged yeah I
mean listen I guess I can't really judge
cuz I'm not normally watching Hannity
but from what I remember he seemed extra
wacky on on Tuesday night also from the
David Pakman show subreddit I would like
David to get more conservative talk show
hosts on the show he always seems to win
the argument and make them look
completely stupid I don't know that
that's how it goes I mean I do think
that a lot of our audience is
predisposed to see my side of a lot of
issues but I am I'm up for here's the
thing about doing the the thing where I
interview conservative talk show hosts
in general the audience doesn't I can't
say what the audience does or doesn't
like but the audience doesn't tend to be
that interested from a numbers
perspective in me interviewing other
political commentators right the things
that seem to do better our interviews
with actual newsmakers primary sources
on issues scientists professors experts
in fields when I do the interviews with
other pundit types or commentator types
it doesn't usually do that well with
some exception so that's why I we tend
not to book those types of guests but
I'm totally up for having more
conservative talk show hosts on if
people are interested in that yeah it's
kind of surprising in a way because
you'd think that if they have a big
audience their viewers would want to see
the exchange too if they tell their
audience that they're appearing on the
show which they might not what he does
they may they may not be doing that so
anyway something to think about I'm sort
of open to it and lastly from the David
Pakman show subreddit entitled David
tries to shame a busy scientist for not
clearing a schedule to talk to David for
free so that David can profit this is a
troll on our subreddit what they're
referring to is the other day Pat sent
an email out to Ben Goldacre who wrote a
book named bad science who I'm reading
the book and I'd like to interview him
and his publicist wrote back basically
saying he's too busy unless we give him
money and we've never paid any guests to
be on the show so I was not pleased with
that so I went on Twitter and I tweeted
him listen I'm really disappointed I'm
reading your book I think it's fantastic
and your publicist says you can only do
it if we pay you and he wrote back
genuinely seeming sort of surprised that
his publicist was saying that but still
not agreeing to come on for without
charging and the the subreddit user is
saying I'm entitled because I expect him
to appear for free it's not that I
expect him to appear for free it's that
you don't really pay for interview yet I
know either you say as a guest I want to
appear because I want to have the
conversation or I think that it'll sell
books or whatever or you say you're not
going to do it but the I'm really busy
unless you pay me thing is not something
that's very common from guests I don't
think it's about my entitlement if
anything it's about the entitlement of
that publicist to say unless you can pay
you're not we're not going to do it and
also I was thinking what is the amount
they would expect right we had a
conversation off air because if all they
want is a hundred bucks it's pretty
pathetic to even say I would only do it
if you give me a hundred bucks if they
want five grand
it's just laughable like how would
anyone think that paying Ben Goldacre
five grand to appear would be worth it
for anybody I was willing to empty my
piggy bank but you were convincing me
that nine dollars and sixty two cents
wasn't gonna cut it
no you changed my mind if 962 was what
it was going to take then it's pathetic
and that's not really an interview we
should be doing anyway so yeah I'm
really entitled for trying to bring good
guests to the audience what a terrible
person I am okay let's settle back down
david pakman.com slash reddit is where
you can participate in those discussions
ok listen so Fox News has reported on
Roseanne Bars response to me on Twitter
yesterday after her firing but has
removed all evidence that she was
actually responding to me so remind you
yesterday when Roseanne said that ambien
may have been responsible we can
actually go back to the beginning this
all started when Roseanne tweeted Muslim
Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes had a
baby equals Valerie Jarrett that got her
fired from ABC News and then she put out
there the idea that it was ambien that
was in some way responsible for these
tweets and when she did that I responded
to her and said on Twitter oh man this
is just the best Roseann is now
defending her tweets by saying ambien
made her racist and she responded
directly to me saying no I didn't I
blamed myself
stop lying yes I have had odd ambien
experiences on tweeting late at night
like many other people do I blame myself
okay it's just an explanation not an
excuse
okay bully so Fox News reported on that
tweet they removed the reference to her
tweeting too deep Hackman which is me
and they also removed that last thing
where she said okay bully because that
would make it sort of obvious that she's
responding to someone and here is how
Fox News reported on Roseanne Bars tweet
to me no evidence that I was involved in
this thing whatsoever
Roseanne then simultaneously thanked her
supporters for defending her and then
asked them not to stick up for her
quoting hey guys don't defend me it's
sweet of you to try but losing my show
is zero compared to being labeled a
racist over one tweet that I regret even
more and then when she blamed ambien man
Twitter took her to task on Roseanne
responded quoting no I didn't I blamed
myself
stop lying yes I have had odd ambien
experiences on tweeting late at night
like many other people do I blame myself
okay and the ellipses there which was
visible to people who are watching tells
the tale of what was removed which was
calling me a bully I don't really care
but it's yet again I mean just a month
or so ago when Stephen Colbert picked up
on the fact that Melania had liked our
tweet or a tweet about our story
questioning what's going on with her and
Donald Trump's relationship Stephen
Colbert also removing all references to
me and I know it's not all about me but
it's just funny that we keep getting
cooked by corporate media I think they
just don't want to get lost in the
details so it's not a direct insult it's
more of a missed opportunity I think I
think it's a missed opportunity is the
right way to say it I like how your
Twitter though and in your Twitter who
took her to task right I heard the
Twitter took her to task
they showed a response it was a response
to me right it would have been nice to
get a little mention but that sounded
like trace Gallagher reading those
tweets not expecting a shout-out from
trace Gallagher anytime soon on Fox News
let's talk about net neutrality I've
been covering not only the federal
government effort to restore net
neutrality the Senate vote to do it
over the last year and a half to two
years we've seen a real resurgence of
pseudo-intellectual thinking especially
led by this internet movement that I
think people who watch this show are
sort of familiar with and there was an
article in The New York Times recently
by Barry Weiss that has gotten a lot of
attention writing about what some are
calling the intellectual dark web and I
didn't agree with nearly everything that
she wrote in the piece but she does do
an interesting job of exposing people to
the fact that this movement exists
I guess maybe movement is the word I
don't even know if we can really call it
a movement and explaining to people sort
of some of the players involved in some
of the ideology involved and I don't
even really know exactly who's part of
this movement the article in The Times
talked about sam harris jordan peterson
eric weinstein dave rubin ben shapiro a
lot of different people were mentioned
and most of the people described in the
article are certainly not intellectuals
by any stretch of the imagination but I
think that the more interesting part is
less about the intellectuals or
pseudo-intellectuals themselves and more
about why they are increasingly why
there is a group that is increasingly
attracted to those types of characters
and as I've said before and we've talked
about pseudo intellectual ism a lot on
the program to really fight back against
pseudo intellectual ism you have to
understand the two sides of the problem
and in the New York Times article and
elsewhere some of the people I mentioned
will ascribe to their followers a desire
for truth and truly open debate about
all ideas with no taboo topics as the
reason for their success right their
story is people are so starved for real
discussion about real issues because of
the repression of the liberal media and
political correctness and sometimes they
blame post-modernism that there was just
this overwhelming pent-up demand for
exactly what these intellectual dark
Weber's or whatever you want to call
them or offer
now I completely disagree and it's a
two-part issue as to how it all happened
the first part is why do we have a
population that's particularly receptive
right now to pseudo-intellectual ideas
that can sometimes sound unique and
correct and accurate and then part two
is the sort of inability to distinguish
between real intellectual thought real
critical thinking real seeing of
knowledge or seeking knowledge for the
sake of knowledge versus just pseudo
intellectual nonsense that sounds pretty
good without really saying anything
unique or even in many cases substantive
so let's start with part one the
environment I've spoken about that quite
a bit there are people right now who
feel disassociate they feel as though
whatever real or perceived status they
have may be on the brink of going away
and they have been primed to accept faux
intellectual nonsense that seems to
explain why it is that they're
experiencing what they're experiencing
and maybe even present some ideas as to
how they might be able to stop it or fix
the problem they see they've been
conditioned that academia is just
liberal indoctrination and bad or that
actual intellectualism is bad that they
won't get the real truth because of
censorship and political correctness and
all of that stuff and that view exists
more on the right but not exclusively
there are left-wing elements to this as
well for sure there are people on the
Left who have also fallen for movements
like men's rights activism that they
won't get the truth about the oppression
of men because evil feminists won't
allow the truth to come out or sjw's or
whoever then there's the question of
aside from being primed for
pseudo-intellectual answers to why the
world is the way it is why do they fall
for the faux intellectual nonsense
specifically from some of the people
were now seeing and a lot of it is
presentation style right it's how people
speak it's marketing period they they
hear the seemingly esoteric language but
they understand it because the truth is
what these people are selling and it's
not actually difficult to understand for
them the truth is it's not unique or
notable
either but it's very appealing the
desire for the feeling of authority that
knowing the real truth brings to them is
this is a big tractor beam to borrow a
phrase from Star Wars and they heard
from someone who's managed to get around
censorship that these are the people
that are gonna tell you the real truth
with no political correctness getting in
the way and a lack of context is often
what makes the phone intellectual
nonsense effective right people hear
ideas that sound good enough and they're
different than what they've been told
before so they buy it without
considering the real implications of
those ideas in the real world and in the
end there's a lot about simply people
that command authority as a factor here
right sometimes it's people that speak
quickly like ben shapiro or loudly or
eloquently like jordan Peterson or
whatever right there's a that's a huge
factor the optics of the presentation
and that's actually a really similar
mechanism as to what's at play within
the world of pseudoscience which we'll
be dealing with in a minute mini-series
soon but there's also some overlap with
the conspiracy theories I've explained
before that with conspiracy conspiracy
theories the appeal is sometimes simple
and neat explanations which even if
untrue are more comforting than the
truth which is often some version of the
world is a gray area of unpredictability
period right so look I'll give you an
example to illustrate the point from the
conspiracy world rather than we were
attacked by people on 9/11 and we either
couldn't or didn't stop it and people
randomly died it was a it was a tragedy
with a huge random element to it it's
more comforting to some to believe that
9/11 was controlled and planned maybe
even by people in our government maybe
george w bush combined with a world
trade center that was painted with
thermite the walls were painted with
thermite paint for years to make the
building catch on fire more easily and
the analogy with pseudo-intellectual ISM
is for example take the race and IQ
discussion which has become very popular
rather than recognizing and evaluating
the multi-generational socio
economic issues that on a test like IQ
lead to what appear to be correlations
of race and IQ so on and so forth
instead how about some races are just
smarter period inherently right or
another example from the so-called
intellectual dark web there are real
differences between men and women that's
a popular one yeah does does anybody
deny that that's not original that's
what really gets to me about the so
called intellectual dark web I've heard
nothing unique from any of them and I
mean you know looking at their full
range of topics
Jordan Peterson's book twelve rules for
life assume that the person you are
listening to might know something you
don't
Wow wait a second you go back and you
read how to win friends and influence
people by Dale Carnegie from 1936 and
his book is filled with the exact same
idea be a good listener encourage others
to talk about themselves let the other
person do a great deal of the talking
try to honestly see things from the
other person's point of view there's
nothing even remotely notable about
jordan Peterson's twelve rules of life
or for life or whatever another example
is the idea around free speech and
censorship that right there are a lot of
people activated by this intellectual
dark web movement because they feel like
they can't say what they want to anymore
there's nothing remarkable about that I
grew up around people like that the sort
of hill town folks from around the
Northampton Massachusetts area they
believe that the political correctness
of the college towns in in the Pioneer
Valley were suffocating them and
preventing them from saying what they
wanted to say although it was never
really clear what it was they wanted to
say that they actually couldn't say
that's not unique it's not new it's not
even notable in any way or free speech
as a meta issue that trumps all other
issues that's another calling card of
the intellectual dark web anyone who has
thought about meta issues in political
and economic society almost always
includes the role of speech at the top
of the list I included along with how
politics are financed the media world
and our economic system those are the
meta issues there is nothing unique or
notable there
let's take a more specific example one
of the sort of common ideas that I'm
seeing on the intellectual dark web is
ideas around taxation right where what
we have is unfair it punishes success
and you end up with some version of a
flat tax or a semi flat tax that's
getting presented now is some kind of
compromise between who knows what
arbitrary positions on either side flat
taxes have been floating around forever
right it's it's not unique it's not new
it's not even remotely interesting and
that is why it is abundantly clear that
the entire intellectual dark web dark
web movement is not an intellectual
movement it's a movement around
marketing and presentation style
combined with using the Internet and
social media period that is all there's
nothing unique period and the solution
sadly is not real intellectuals right if
you think that real intellectuals will
solve the problem of pseudo intellectual
ism that's like thinking if I just
explained the facts about gay marriage
to my homophobic cousin he'll
immediately change his mind we actually
know that the opposite is often true
being presented with information that
seeks to disprove or contradict your
worldview our understanding of the world
will often just further ingrain you in
those beliefs the real problem is the
environment in which the faux
intellectual nonsense of these people is
not only able to take hold but actually
welcomed with open arms as I described
earlier in this discussion and that's
what I don't know how to change the faux
intellectuals the intellectual dark web
and all of that stuff is a consequence
of the problem that we have in society
which I've identified for a long time in
many conversations about both anti
intellectualism and pseudo intellectual
ism so send me your thoughts about how
I've laid this out if I'm wrong change
my mind
tell me what unique or notable ideas are
actually coming out of the so called
intellectual dark web I'm on twitter at
des Pakman and the show is on Twitter at
David Pakman show
so let's reset a little bit as we
transition to
I already spoke earlier in the show
about how Donald Trump is now very
interested in helping China regain jobs
when I thought the goal was to get jobs
back from China for Trump and it seems
to coincide with the news of a 500
million dollar contribution alone
effectively from China to an Indonesian
Trump linked resort well the White House
was asked about it as they should have
been Sarah Huckabee Sanders apparently
off yesterday Deputy Secretary a deputy
press secretary Raj Shah ran yesterday's
press conference and he was asked a very
simple question which is a question that
has been has been suggested many times
in the last 24 hours which is how does
this not violate the emoluments Clause
of the Constitution it is the
president's business getting something
of value from a foreign government Raj
Shah wouldn't answer it and it's hard to
imagine how he even could answer it
let's check out the video the Trump
Organization is involved in a project in
Indonesia building hotels Golf Course
residences it's getting up to 500
million dollars in backing from the
Chinese government can you tell or you
know explain the administration's
perspective on a how this wouldn't
violate the emoluments Clause and be how
it wouldn't violate the president's own
promise that his private organization
would not be getting involved in new
foreign deals while he was present to
refer you to the Trump Organization but
I mean the Trump Organization can't
speak on behalf of the President as the
president the head of the federal
government the one who is who's
responsible who needs to assure the
American PM you're asking about a
private organisations dealings that may
have to do with a foreign government
that's not something that I can speak to
so the entire premise of the answer is
nonsense right Raj Shah says we can't
speak on on the behalf of the Trump
Organization we're not talking about the
Trump Organization we're talking about
number one the promise that candidate
Trump made that as president Trump he
would not be involved in any foreign
deals that relates to the president
we're also talking about the president
receiving something of value from a
foreign country seemingly a violation of
the emoluments clause if you went to the
Trump Organization and asked them they'd
correctly say we're just a private
company the emoluments Clause of
applies to government officials talk to
someone who represents Trump as a
government official and the one thing
that Raj's answer does sort of
illuminate is that there's a question at
this point as to whether there really is
separation between President Trump and
Trump the CEO of the Trump Organization
right the guy hasn't divested from his
businesses he continues to be aware of
their business activity and deals he
continues to benefit from them so really
it's almost like there is no difference
and Raja is either actually ignorant or
just playing stupid about the fact that
Trump as president is very involved with
the business of the Trump Organization
so even taken at face value the
statement by Raja makes no sense if
Shahs answer is this has to do with the
Trump Organization and not President
Trump the immediate next question should
be well does presidents Trump does
president Trump still have a financial
interest in the Trump Organization or
did he divest and obviously Shahs answer
would be you'd have to talk to his
personal attorney who at this point by
the way is in no position to really be
answering any questions dealing with a
potential indictment himself and Michael
Cohen this is the same strategy that was
employed by Sarah Huckabee Sanders
earlier this month remember this I just
wanted to ask you about something that
took place last week involving the
president's personal attorney Michael
Cohen he in court documents asserted
that he would assert his Fifth Amendment
rights and the story guy Hills lawsuit
which was filed against both him and the
president and you may recall that in
September of 2017 the president at a
campaign rally said the mob takes the
fifth and he also said if you're
innocent why are you taking the Fifth
Amendment do those ideas also apply to
Michael Colin as the president stand by
those comments I can't speak on behalf
of Michael Cohen I'd were free
it is disgusting that they get away with
us and during the same briefing Raj Shah
was asked why the hell is Trump tweeting
support for specific Chinese companies
and what led up to that also no answer
from Raj about that yes
so I've two questions for you first on
ZTE did the Chinese government give any
specific concession for the President of
the United States between in support of
a Chinese company the president has
asked secretary Ross to look into the
matter a consistent and on being why did
he issue has been raised at many levels
by the Chinese government with the with
various levels of our administration
raising the issue is enough to spawn a
presidential it's a significant issue of
concern of the Chinese government you
know and in our bilateral relationship
there's a give-and-take and we and we
discuss these issues this is what needs
to be immediately shut down and
investigated if Democrats do well in the
November midterms and you know Pat we've
been talking about the multiple prongs
of molars investigation right we've got
Trump Russia
we've got obstruction and possible
crimes witness tampering indy covering
up of attempts to stop Trump Russia and
then financial crimes of a sort of
pretty specific nature molars not
looking into the emoluments clause thing
to the best of my knowledge we need to
vote in November because the concerns
around constitutional violations are
massive growing and presumably outside
of molar scope yeah and even if
something's outside of Muller's purview
you can always delegate that
responsibility off of someone else like
send it to an attorney general in
another state so we've we have seen that
and I think we'll continue to see that
yeah of course the complexity
specifically when it's emoluments is
you're talking about the Federal
Constitution so then it becomes dubious
to send it to a State Attorney General
that is something that at the federal
level must be looked into it's
disgusting it is swamp filling and we
may have a president here who has indeed
violated the Constitution discuss this
with us on reddit david pakman.com slash
re d di t quick break back after this
okay I've told you before about the
evangelical support for Israel being
very heavily
driven by the belief that by supporting
Israel the second coming of Jesus Christ
will happen and depending on your flavor
of Christianity this will bring about
the rapture or the apocalypse or the end
times or the end of the world
whichever lovely phrase your sect
attributes to that event I've also told
you before about outrageous Fox News
host Jeanine Pirro who was at some point
a judge somewhere really scary to think
about and she combined her insanity with
the evangelical insanity around Israel
in one lovely segment where she praised
Donald Trump's decision to move the
embassy that the United States has in
Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as the
fulfillment of a Biblical prophecy
listen to Jeanine Pirro here just
gushing about how great Donald Trump is
Donald Trump's and Iranians who are the
descendants of Persia a message to
reflect on their own history right and
that it was the king of Persia who a
thousand years before Mohammed was even
born
that said Jerusalem was the capital of
the Jewish people's country Russia
there will be no Ottoman empires or
chien nations that will destroy
Jerusalem any longer Donald Trump
recognized history he like King Cyrus
before him fulfilled the Biblical
prophecy
the gods worshipped by Jews Christians
and yes yes Muslims that Jerusalem is
the eternal capital of the Jewish state
and that the Jewish people finally
deserve a righteous free and sovereign
Israel I notice she has that same weird
pronunciation of Jerusalem that Trump
had in that video where it didn't it
wasn't clear whether he was trying to
eat his tongue or maybe had a denture
issue I wonder if maybe it's like having
veneers that are too big or something
[Music]
the david pakman show at david
pakman.com so one of the moves that we
knew the trump administration would be
trying to make pretty quickly after
trump's inauguration was to move the
embassy of the united states in israel
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and I've
explained why this is an absolutely
terrible idea and the gist of it is that
within Israel there are of course many
people that consider Jerusalem to be the
capital of the country but
internationally Jerusalem is a disputed
territory it's sort of like if
internationally Washington DC was the
capital of the United States but imagine
that internally we sort of thought that
New York was our capital but we were in
a land dispute with Canada / New York
right sort of an analogous situation an
imaginary analogy currently West
Jerusalem is considered part of Israel
East Jerusalem is considered part of the
Palestinian territories with the old
city within that under Israeli control
but with a particular part of the old
city with jurisdiction given back to the
Palestinian Authority very complicated
situation but the long and short of it
is that the future of Jerusalem is by
all reasonable accounts part of what
would be negotiated in a peace agreement
hypothetically if we ever got to that
point again and of course with Jared
Kushner leading that crusade doesn't
seem like we're gonna get there anytime
soon so internationally Tel Aviv is the
capital of Israel that's where the
United States has had its embassy Donald
Trump's choice for ambassador to Israel
we learned pretty early on was going to
be and eventually it became David
Friedman and as soon as we knew that
David Friedman was going to be the guy
to be the US ambassador to Israel we
knew that a top priority would be to
move the embassy to Jerusalem Friedman
is the epitome of a right-wing extremist
on the issue of Israel he is of the
mindset that more settlements are good
which is in the spectrum of views on
settlements to really understand how
wacky that position is you've got to
understand what the sort of range of
positions is and the range tends to be
something like demolish all settlements
and get out completely give that land
back to Palestinians stop building new
ones but presume that existing
settlements may be allowed to stay if
there are meaningful land swaps in
exchange as part of a peace agreement
get the the current settlements to stay
but only if there's some kind of
integration with Palestinians right
there's all these sort of different
views the extremist view is not only are
the settlements not a problem but we
should be building even more settlements
and that's the view of Donald Trump's
ambassador to Israel David Freedman so
completely retrograde on that issue and
Trump has been touting that moving the
embassy to Jerusalem will actually be a
good thing with respect to possible
peace talks between Israelis and
Palestinians because it'll take
Jerusalem off the table right Trump's
idea is listen right now the issue of
Jerusalem is a negotiating issue if we
just move the embassy to Jerusalem and
more importantly recognize Jerusalem as
the capital of Israel we're taking it
off the table for future negotiations
and of course I cannot imagine a more
short-sighted and childish view of the
situation the unilateral decision to
move the embassy without it being part
of an agreement is only going to inflame
the situation and make it more difficult
to even get people to the table to do
the negotiation and of course violence
is escalating completely predictably at
least 25 already dead in the Gaza Strip
in the midst of growing protests against
this move of the embassy Hamas of course
benefiting greatly vowing even more
protest tomorrow mas as I've told you
always acting with no regard whatsoever
for the safety of the Palestinian people
and this will in turn be used to justify
even more pushback by Israeli forces and
the cycle continues this
endless cycle and at the end of the day
we see who it is that influences Donald
Trump its Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu a vile right-winger connected
to the most extreme elements of the
Israeli political spectrum he has gotten
just major concessions from Trump over
the last several weeks
Trump has announced that he's going to
pull the United States out of the Iran
deal which Netanyahu of course loves
hearing from Donald Trump it's a totally
backwards move geopolitically Trump now
following through on moving the embassy
to Jerusalem initially a sort of
provisional embassy with a bigger
build-out coming in the future that's
another move that strengthens Benjamin
Netanyahu's hardliner stands and at this
point I'm genuinely unsure about whether
Netanyahu has even offered Donald Trump
anything in response for all of this
right in other words did Netanyahu
simply manipulate Trump into doing what
he wants Trump to do without having to
offer anything or is there some quid pro
quo here right either real or promised
or hypothetical going on in the
background it's possible that there is a
quid pro quo it's also very possible
that Donald Trump has merely done this
because he's convinced that it's the
correct or cool thing to do and Benjamin
Netanyahu has bamboozled him into doing
it and when we talk about the future of
Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel a guy who
is the subject of multiple criminal
investigations a guy whose wife is also
being looked into for criminal activity
it's the type of guy Trump loves right
Benjamin Netanyahu is in the direction
although not clearly as far as people
like Rodrigo Duterte
and president air Dewan of Turkey and
Kim jong-un of North Korea these are the
types that Trump likes and that's why
it's not even remotely surprising that
Netanyahu seems to have Owen Putin who
can forget Putin Netanyahu seems to have
Donald Trump effectively wrapped around
his finger disastrous decision made here
and I'm sure we'll continue to talk
about the horrible consequences over the
coming weeks and months let's reset
what's going on with Crump attorney
Michael Cohen we learned last week
because of initially tweets from stormy
Daniels attorney Michael avenatti
learned that Michael Cohen through a
shell company called essential
consultants was the recipient of more
than a million dollars that we know of
specifically and allegedly of more than
four million dollars of basically
influence money $600,000 from AT&T 1.2
million dollars from big from Switzer
pharmaceutical company Novartis
reportedly $500,000 from a Putin
connected Russian business owner
billionaire and allegedly many many
other transfers of money and supposedly
the reason that these companies were
paying Michael Cohen's a consulting firm
was for insights into the Trump
administration and of course the timing
was very suspect the timing of the AT&T
money 600,000 not 200,000 as originally
reported coincided with not only the
repeal of net neutrality by the Trump
FCC but also with the fact that AT&T was
trying to merge with Time Warner The
Washington Post has now obtained
internal AT&T documents meaning this is
what AT&T wrote internally about the
real reasons why they were paying money
to Michael Cohen and the internal
documents from AT&T indicate that hiring
Michael Cohen was done to help with the
Time Warner merger AT&T hired the
personal attorney of the President of
the United States to provide advice
about a merger which Trump's own
Department of Justice would be
adjudicating so this is a story about
corruption fundamentally it should not
be a partisan story because corruption
cuts both ways much like freedom of the
press and it can be very tempting to
look the other way
when the lack of press freedom or of
corrosive corruption is helping your
side but that's how we end up screwing
ourselves in the long run and this is
quickly growing to the level of I mean I
don't know to pick an example the
corruption during the presidency of
ulysses s grant which was considered
huge right it included Black Friday
it included a major railroad scam it
included the whiskey ring pond-scum
corruption and cronyism what we are
seeing now under the Trump
administration in terms of
RUP ssin and cronyism is rising above
and beyond even what we saw under
president ulysses s grant and this is
circumstantial evidence of bribery right
the AT&T hiring of michael cohen
Novartis the other companies were
learning about and it's not about
bribery the crime yet but it is deduced
evidence of intent to bribe and receive
bribes and it has to be looked into and
Americans should be united on this
they're not and that is really one of
the scariest things that we're seeing
about the looking the other way on Trump
Russia looking the other way on the
cronyism looking the other way on the
broader bamboozling that has taken place
because this has every indication of
being pay-to-play
which by the way Trump said was a reason
not to vote for Hillary selling access
directly or indirectly explicitly or
implicitly to the President of the
United States and we only have the
information so far about some of the
more than four million dollars that
supposedly ran through this one company
of Cohen's
essential consultants I would be willing
to bet that there is much more and I
hope that we learn about it soon and and
it's important I mentioned legally right
some will say okay AT&T paid Cohen to
help get the merger approved Trump hates
CNN owned by Time Warner Trump opposed
the deal anyway
is it still illegal is it still bribery
even if it wasn't successful bribery and
the answer from legal experts is yes the
offer of a quid pro quo is what makes it
bribery taking money to help get a
merger through getting screwed because
Trump's Justice Department ended up
opposing it doesn't excuse the bribery
we could call it stupid bribery we could
call it failed bribery but it is still
bribery and of course whether there's
going to be any legal repercussions
remains to be seen I am really
disappointed that we're not seeing both
sides put their foot down and say this
is not democracy right and because
corruption is everywhere in our politics
it's unclear as to whether or not
Michael Cohen even committed a crime
here but if he did commit a crime you
have to imagine that Robert Miller
use that to his advantage because he
already has Michael Cohen at the palm of
his hand right if you would think with
the Russia stuff and the stormy Daniel
stuff he could use this as leverage to
maybe that would cause Michael Cohen to
flip on Trump that's increasingly the
discussion I mean we've known that Cohen
has been a likely in Die T of robert
muller for a while and at this point the
questions are number one is this
something molar is concerned with we
believe the answer is yes because we
know Cohen's spoke to both AT&T and
Novartis months ago so clearly Cohen
knows about this question too is there a
point at which Michael Cohen's supposed
the love of Donald Trump just thinking
he's just the best guy out there is
there a point at which it was even going
it would become too much pressure even
on Cohen and Cohen does flip I don't
know the answer to that but it is
something that we may soon learn send me

during the 2016 presidential campaign
Donald Trump campaigned on
pharmaceutical drug prices being too
high and that one of his priorities was
gonna be to negotiate lower prices he
was going to be tough it was gonna be
great for consumers great for patients
great for everybody except the drug
companies and of course that quickly
changed when right after winning the
election Trump met with a bunch of big
pharma
executives and lobbyists and he came out
of that meeting and all of a sudden he
wasn't concerned about drug prices
anymore and now he's gone completely in
the other direction saying that in other
countries governments have negotiated
drug prices that are simply too low and
he's calling it the extortion of big
pharma Trump said that quote it's time
to end the
freeloading once and for all and that
the price controls that other countries
have negotiated with Big Pharma are
quote extortion of quote unreasonably
low prices from drug makers what's the
point of all this why is Trump even
talking about this the reason is Trump
is arguing that if other countries
didn't extort low prices from Big Pharma
the US would have cheaper prices because
we wouldn't be subsidizing the low
prices of other countries and this is
one of the most simplistic and naive
views of drug pricing that I've maybe
ever heard from a president Trump's
basically saying if you allow drug
makers to charge more in other countries
they'd say hey you know what we're
making more in other countries let's
lower prices here in the US since after
all we don't need to make all that money
after all what are we for-profit
companies oh yeah we are and this is
ridiculous at its face and experts agree
it's ridiculous as a professor of a
health policy Paul Ginsburg who says the
obvious which is Big Pharma sets prices
to maximize profits right they will
charge the most they can profitably
charge in Europe and then they will
charge the most that they can profitably
charge in the United States if they can
charge more in Europe or Asia or South
America they will and they'll make more
money and they're not going to then
charge less in the United States because
they're making more money in Europe or
Asia or South America and in fact the
market recognized this because when
Trump said this thing which effectively
means let's get prices up in other
countries the market thought this was
great and pharmaceutical company stock
prices jumped right if this was really
zero some if as prices went up in Europe
they were to come down in the United
States if that was expected you wouldn't
see the markets so excited over Donald
Trump talking about pushing up big
pharmaceutical prices in other countries
the reason the stocks went up is that
this will be a net gain they'll charge a
lot in the United States and they'll
charge more in other countries and truly
think about how dumb this argument is
right Trump saying that the low prices
in other countries are extortion
pharmaceutical companies aren't forced
to do business in other countries if the
prices in France for example
were too low then any pharmaceutical
company could say we're not going to do
business in France anymore because we're
losing money if they're making enough
money in those other countries to
continue doing business there clearly
it's to their advantage to continue
doing business and this also by the way
I was thinking of the horrible timing of
this we just found out that 1.2 million
dollars flowed from Novartis to Trump's
lawyer Michael Cohen for insights into
the Trump administration not exactly the
best time for Trump to be talking about
bringing drug prices up right when it
when we find out that actually his
personal attorney was receiving all
sorts of money from Novartis for health
care policy work as we learned last week
and when Trump said he was going to
negotiate lower drug prices for
Americans I guess what he meant was
force prices up in other parts of the
world so that Americans won't think
they're getting screwed anymore because
the prices will be really high
everywhere I I genuinely don't know but
that appears to be his idea this guy
said that wages are too high in America
and steel still he got elected you know
this isn't really a surprise now not not
a surprise at all and shocking the con
man isn't really going to lower drug
prices here in the United States we've
talked about the Trump presidency as the
sword of Fox News presidency Trump
watches Fox News in the morning Fox and
Friends his first tweets of the day are
often based on what was covered on Fox
and Friends that morning we also know
that Trump shares an advisor with Sean
Hannity in attorney Michael Cohen
whether or not Cohen was ever officially
representing Sean Hannity in a legal
capacity we don't really know but we
know that Cohen and Hannity are in touch
and that Hannity has obtained advice
from Cohen so a lot of connections
between Trump and Fox News and there's
now a new report from New York Magazine
which points out that on many nights of
the week Trump and Hannity are having
oddly enough bed time phone calls Trump
is effectively being put to bed by Fox
News propagandist Sean Hannity and
Hannity is reportedly on a list of
cleared friends and family at the White
House switchboard he gets right through
to Donald Trump when he calls and
Trump's routine is increasingly becoming
clear on a day to day
in the morning Trump will watch Fox News
and tweet on the basis of what it is he
sees on TV he watches Fox and Friends in
the evenings he talks to Sean Hannity
and I was thinking as I read this very
interesting article in New York magazine
could the contrast be starter to
President Obama who would read as much
as possible he would read fiction and
nonfiction on his own and he would read
just copious political documents in the
mornings and throughout the day and that
there could be no more antithetical
behavior to that of Barack Obama when it
comes to reading than what we're seeing
from Trump and what New York magazine
also points out is that the morning Fox
and Friends routine is not just Trump's
doing clearly Trump likes watching Fox
and Friends but apparently when Sean
it's great to welcome back to the
program Chris Martenson who's an
economic researcher and futurist
specializing in energy and resource
depletion he's the co-founder of Peak
prosperity dot-com he first joined us
back in the valley free radio days in
the basement of a old Grammar School in
Florence Massachusetts most recently
with us in 2016
Chris thanks so much for talking to me
again David is so good to be back with
you and all your listeners of course so
let's start with the economy today
what do you sort of see what are you
paying attention to maybe in terms of
the Trump economic policy he talks about
trade deals a lot he has announced
tariffs on some goods from different
countries including China steel aluminum
what are sort of like the guideposts
you're following now in terms of
economic policy in the trump era well
you know a president can only affect so
much in any given cycle so you mentioned
a few of the things he's you know taxes
trade those are some things they can
influence but otherwise you kind of
inherit this large thing we call the
economy and right now we're at the
second longest expansion air quotes
around that word in history and so I
think what everybody who's is following
the economy is looking for is you know
when's the next downturn and in that
story it we're probably a little bit
closer to the end than the beginning of
this expansion and so what we're trying
to do is figure out what we're really
are we in this story and this economic
expansion is the weakest set you know
second longest but also the weakest on
record and so this is really a tale of
two worlds David you know we've had the
very very wealthy doing very well
largely because of nothing presidents do
but because of this body called the
Federal Reserve they print money shovel
it into the markets drives the markets
up and the people who own those assets
tada
get wealthier so that's been that's been
the story what they've been waiting for
is for the tail to wag the dog if they
you know Ben Bernanke first said it if
they could just drive interest rates I'm
sorry um interest rates really down the
bottom and that would spur borrowing and
if they could drive asset prices
sky-high then
that would rescue the economy it really
hasn't happened that way and we detect
that in all kinds of Statistics like
median income and how many families have
a thousand dollars to their name things
like that those statistics haven't
really recovered yet so you ask what I'm
tracking I'm just trying to figure out
where is the end because we know we know
there's gonna be a recession at some
point so the question now is can you
spot it you mentioned debt and this I
just realized it jogged my memory that I
wanted to talk to you about that in our
last interview you talked about the
concern you had over global debt and in
the last six to 12 months more more than
just less six to twelve months but
particularly in the last six to 12
months we've been following modern
monetary theory and we've interviewed
people like Pavlina Chernova and
stephanie kelton who worked with the
Bernie Sanders campaign and there's the
school of economic thought that debt in
and of itself is not really the problem
printing money in and of itself is not
per se a problem the question is what is
being done with the money that a
government prints and if the right
things are being done with it
it doesn't trigger these inflationary
spirals where are you on mmt I take a
completely different view I fall much
closer to the Austrian side which which
has a much more what I call a reality
based approach not that mmt isn't
reality based but but here's the reality
money is just a claim debts a claim on
future money money's a claim on stuff
the $20 in my or your pocket does
nothing unless we can take it and buy
coffee with it or a shirt at the
Salvation Army or something right so we
always have to look at what's the
relationship between the amount of
claims and the actual economy itself so
when you say economy we're talking goods
and services right things things being
made produced and sold with a value add
or services being delivered again
hopefully with a value add when we track
it that way we look at the increase in
overall indebtedness and the amount of
money creation that's happened and we've
never been in a period of history like
this and my view is that what we've done
is we've put extraordinary amounts of
promises and claims on the future and
the question is can those be paid back I
depart very sharply from the MMT people
who think
hey you know we haven't seen a lot of
problems with it so far therefore we can
conclude there aren't really any
problems with it and that's actually not
true historically speaking and I think
it's only temporarily been true because
all the world's major central banks have
been playing the same parlor game
thereby in our debt we're buying theirs
they've been stuffing it on balance
sheets pretending it doesn't matter but
it has to matter at some point otherwise
oh okay looking let's see if we can like
take that in pieces a little bit I don't
know that I've heard anyone on the MMT
side say that the debt doesn't matter
but I think just as a sort of thought
experiment the idea that not every
dollar of debt is created equal does
make a lot of sense in the sense that if
the Federal Reserve prints a hundred
million dollars and gives it to very
rich people who don't need the money
they mostly just save it and that is a
very very low economic multiplier right
it's not very economically stimulative
if you print a hundred million dollars
and you put it into I don't know funding
government health care that directly
creates jobs because there will be more
people now who are seeking health care
services that means that people are
earning wages and the government is
collecting income tax on some of those
wages so right away we see that just
printing a hundred million dollars and
adding a hundred million to the debt
depending on what you do with it has a
very different net effect on the economy
like that part you you would agree with
I would guess you take some exception to
that because what you just described
with spending it on purely consumptive
services right so it's wonderful that we
take a hundred million dollars spend it
on health care but what really happens
in terms of that impact the answer is
zero unless you do that again next year
so part of the thing that we've gotten
ourselves locked into at the government
level is all of this printing and
deficit spending to be stimulative but
unless you're spending it on increasing
productivity or you're increasing
spending on infrastructure which has
this long-term economic gain you're
really just spending it and and that be
the healthcare example wasn't a good one
but I mean certainly it sounds like
you're saying if I had said
infrastructure then there would be a
difference than rich people putting it
in bank accounts yeah you know with the
big asterisks which says they've spent
that money wisely right and so the
infrastructure is
paving another eight lane highway to
nowhere because we love cars so much and
maybe you said we're gonna follow
China's model and we're gonna connect
you know in cities by high-speed rail I
have trained Envy everytime I go to
China huge train envy but but you know
if we were spending it on some stuff so
it gets very complex very quickly but
the bottom line David is this if you
print money out of thin air you do not
actually create wealth doing that what
you do is you've created real purchasing
power but where did it come from and the
answer is it comes from everybody so
it's really saying that what we want to
do is is harvest a little bit from from
every person with savings out there and
then decide where we're gonna use it and
if we had a robust conversation around
that you could you could draw me into
that or a convinced we have robust
conversations on 2,700 page spending
bills in Congress right now okay so
point point without going fully into mm
tea exclusively you you do not agree
generally speaking with the MMT
theorists that at this point at least
oh you can't print your way to
prosperity absolutely not
let's talk about tariffs a little bit I
read a very interesting article recently
that sort of described trade wars as a
version of the prisoner's dilemma game
theory experiment but not the the first
one that's usually taught in game theory
101 but the repeating prisoner's dilemma
one in which actors tend to have will
have the information of the other
players before deciding what to do the
next time is that a good analogy how do
you assess the idea of the Trump tariffs
well you know I've long been this is
actually something that oddly I find
myself in the side of Trump with because
I've been saying this for many years
well before Trump came along which is
that you can't have free trade unless
it's truly free we don't have free trade
in the sense that I'm a u.s. business
person I have to comply with a whole
stack of laws because my country said
hey we want people to not be
discriminated against have you know have
disabled access to everything we want
you know workers comp health care
there's all this stuff I don't disagree
with any of it but if I'm and if I'm a
steel manufacturer I'm not but if I was
and I was in direct competition with a
China or in India which has none of
those protections who we said oh we're
only going to come
on price whatever you can ship it to
here that's really that's not free trade
it's not fair trade it's it's actually
something that benefits the
corporation's tremendously because they
get to go to the lowest cost environment
either in terms of lack of environmental
controls or cheaper labor or whatever it
is and then bring the product back and
say that it has you know the locally
produced product has to compete
that's not fair so if we say if we want
to say we don't want to have fair or
free trade fine but I think that the
idea here is Trump is the first
candidate that came forward and said I'm
going to speak to them to the persons
whose jobs have been exported I'm not
sure he's gonna get all the way there
but literally nobody else in either the
Republicans or the Democratic Party was
speaking for that vast swath of middle
America who's seen their job and job
opportunities mostly exported the good
jobs left but that wasn't an accident
that was an active act of policy that
was lobbied for and really granted by
both parties wasn't it totally missing
from the discussion that lots of the
jobs that supposedly would be
reinvigorated either through tariffs or
better trade deals simply don't exist
anymore because they've been replaced by
machines well a lot of them have in in
them you know that's really a trend
that's going to continue I I served on a
panel to help NASA was a hundred years
old now and they're saying what are we
gonna do for the next hundred years so
they had this blue sky meeting and asked
the question of really diverse group of
people what's the next hundred years
look like and the people who are there
from artificial intelligence and
robotics said there's not a single job
they can imagine that can't be done
better by AI and robots than humans
except maybe getting a massage but
they're they meant everything accounting
lawyer doctor you name it every
specialty is possibly can be done faster
better cheaper by technology at this
point when it comes to for example the
China relationship with the tariffs I
found it very interesting that even
though the Trump administration proposed
a list of some hundred plus items from
China that would have a tariffs placed
on them that that represented a
relatively small portion of the exports
from the United
to the United States
but the small list of counter tariffs
from China represented about half of
American exports to China what's the
long-term impact of that inequality or
imbalance well I mean what we're really
you know you have to scale it so the
United States imports a ton from China
relatively speaking China imports a lot
less that's why we have a huge trade
imbalance with China right so for them
that what they were doing was just
matching US dollar for dollar they said
oh you're gonna put a hundred billion on
fine we'll put a hundred billion on and
so that tit for tat on a dollar basis
means that on a percentage basis China's
putting a lot larger ding on there and
they did it you know it I think in a
politically smart way not unlike when a
local school board says we didn't get
our 4% raised well we're gonna cut all
the most valuable programs you know to
parents to really make the pain come in
China targeted us soybeans and things
like that so by hitting the agricultural
products they were hitting Trump right
in the political breadbasket and and I
think you know they're clearly saying
you can't push us around
and I realize this goes back away if
you've ever been to China you know they
value face and diplomacy and really
making you know being treated like an
equal and they deserve to be you know
they've got the first quantum satellite
circling the the earth right now they're
they're here they're not up-and-coming
they've arrived and still the United
States is saying you know things like
we're gonna you know put our gunboat
diplomacy around the islands and the
South China Sea you have to do what we
say and we're just gonna call the shots
and China's clearly saying not so fast
we're here too
my concern is that I'm not sure we have
the diplomatic chops in place right now
to to really pull this off maybe China
yeah very pragmatic
good good good understatement if I've
heard one but we may lack the diplomatic
chops right now to pull that off Chris
Martenson we will pause the conversation
there and pick it up with him tomorrow
we're continuing our conversation with
Chris Martenson he's an economic
researcher and futurist specializing in
energy and resource depletion he's the
co-founder of Peak prosperity dot-com
Chris I get asked often what are the
economic indicators that one can look at
to evaluate how an economy is doing and
of course there's really no one
indicator but what I'd be interested in
talking with you about is where
particular indicators are useful and
sort of what the limits of those
indicators are so let's start with one
that is often touted by presidents
either as accurate when the number is
good and about themselves or as fake and
or inaccurate if it's bad about
themselves or good for somebody else and
I'm talking about the unemployment rate
which Donald Trump recently bragged
about being three point nine nine
percent what can we deduce about an
economy from that number the
unemployment rate and what is sort of
outside of that well it's funny you
mentioned Trump because he was he was
touting the other side of that number
when he was running of course and now
he's you know it's saying oh it's much
worse than advertised and now he's
buying it wholesale because it seems to
support his his position here the
unemployment number unfortunately is one
of the most heavily how do I put this
diplomatically unreliable numbers that
exists out there right now and this has
been true every administration since
Lyndon Johnson when they first started
this series every president has put
political pressure to make that number
sing the way they wanted to sing and so
you would think it should be this simple
right how many people are capable of
working and how many are working that
should be the number but it's not it
excludes people who haven't looked for a
little while and it excludes people that
you know just sort of get dropped off
the rolls it double counts people who
have two part-time jobs is two jobs and
so all of that so really the number
itself is is not as useful if it was
just a simple measure of how many people
are capable of working and how many are
the actual unemployment rate is close to
twenty percent right now if you said how
many people want jobs but don't have
them you know that's the so-called the
the people who are no not in labor force
but probably would be if they had an
opportunity
we're probably closer to like a ten or
eleven percent unemployment rate right
now and of course as you know it's being
touted at three point nine percent so
big gaps in those numbers and it really
depends how do you account and so
there's a lot of I think legitimate
criticism about how that counting is
done so it's not a number I put a lot of
stock on I know the markets love it you
know first Friday of the month when it
comes out I don't like it that much
because
it's it's really got some pieces in
there there are they just don't add up
right now so that gets us to labor
participation rate during the Obama era
you had Trump many times talking about
we have 42 percent unemployment if you
base it on how many people are not in
the labor force and of course that one
to me is very deceptive because you can
have people that are outside of the
labor force because there's a problem
with the economy but if the economy is
really good and you have for example
two-parent households where one parent
chooses not to work because the other
parent is doing so well economically
that's an economic that's a reason why
someone would leave the labor force as a
result of the economy being good if you
have a lot of people retiring that's
going to push down the labor
participation rate so I have found the
labor participation rate conspiracy
theories is what I call them from the
right during the Obama era to be
incredibly misleading my right or am I
missing something
well it's it's reasonably correct to
look at the labor participation rate I
think because it's really not the one
the one income household went the way of
the dodo bird
it really I mean it was true during my
parents era I think it was partly true
during my early adulthood I don't think
it's it's not that easy anymore so a
simple example right now in San
Francisco the the median income that a
household can have is about is the
median incomes about seventy-five
thousand but to own a house in that city
you'd have to have at least two hundred
thousand dollars of income and so you
know how many jobs out there are really
paying people 75 or more thousand
dollars not a lot really honestly so you
know we're what we look at the
participation rate you have to
understand what kind of jobs are
available and and really how many of
these are part-time it gets it gets
murky quickly but again I think if you
want to see the number that really sort
of begins to tell the tale it's the ones
that I trust which is very easy to get
this data how what's the average savings
of the median household right how many
people how many households can access a
so then part two of the implosion of
Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Rudy Giuliani
is after putting out that unintelligible
statement I told you about earlier where
it sort of seemed like he was
backtracking on some of the things he
said about the hundred and thirty
thousand dollar stormy Daniels hush
money repayment by Trump to Michael
Cohen Giuliani appeared on ABC Sunday
morning talk show this week and he
dismissed his own statements as mere
rumors and then contradicted himself
multiple times right they I'm gonna play
this for you and I want to prepare you
because of the hyper normalization right
are becoming accustomed to realities
that would have been inconceivable
before the Trump era the interview I'm
about to play might not immediately
strike you as the unhinged drivel that
it is but we have to contextualize it
I'm about to play a clip for you from an
interview where the attorney charged
with speaking to Robert Muller on the
behalf of the President of the United
States is being interviewed this is not
some lawyer that your landlord hires to
evict the tenant right this is the
former mayor of New York City hired by
the President of the United States to
represent him in something that could
conceivably expose alleged criminal
activity by a sitting president and this
is how his lawyer represents him on
national television
take a look but on the other day you
also told BuzzFeed though that at some
point after the 2016 election Michael
Cohen had complained to some people that
he hadn't been paid by Donald Trump and
that so then you said Cohen met with
Trump and told him and Giuliani said
that will cover your expenses they work
at this $35,000 a month retainer after
that so so the president didn't know
about this
after the campaign but can't say that I
mean I at some point yes but it could
have been recently it could have been a
while back those are the facts but we're
still working on and that you know maybe
in a little bit of dispute this is more
rumor than it is anything else well
that's what you said you said that to
BuzzFeed but Rudy Giuliani says these
are mere rumors and George
Stephanopoulos points out well you're
the source like you're I'm quoting you
here if you're dismissing the stormy
Daniels hush money repayment and
installments from Trump to Cohen as a
rumor that's a rumor you started so how
does Rudy Giuliani respond this is his
answer to that but here's the well yeah
I mean that's that's
one of the possibilities and one of the
rumors the reality is you stated it as
fact well maybe I did but I was right
now I'm at the point where I'm learning
and I can only I can't prove that I can
just say it's rumor I could prove it's
rumor but I can't prove it's fact
yeah it's rumor that's right he can
prove it's a rumor of a fact but he's
not yet ready to prove the factual
nature of the rumor of the fact which by
the way all came from him didn't Trump
hire this guy like wouldn't the first
thing he would go to trump and say is
well give me the facts so that I don't
end up spreading rumors on television
right like the is Trump admitting to
pain copain Cohen back or not and if you
can't get the information from the guy
who's just hired you maybe this is not a
guy you should be working for right and
here it continues and it only gets worse
you but you've said is it it isn't you
said as a matter of fact on Hannity and
BuzzFeed you talk to the world I don't
know how do you separate fact and
opinion that's opinion I'll say this is
my opinion and when I state a fact also
you said the president worked out a
retainer agreement with Michael Cohen
after the election order to repay him a
little settlement to stormy Daniels the
second part the second part of it the
last part of it the the retainer
agreement was to repay expenses which
turns out to have included this one to
the woman the asan Saturday Night Live
last night trying to make more money and
now our NDA with her seems to be
irrelevant because she wants to break it
up because she wants to make a lot more
money than hundred and thirty thousand I
never thought a hundred and thirty
thousand I know this sounds funny to
people there at home I never thought a
hundred thirty thousand was a real
payment it's a nuisance payment when I
settle this for when it was real or a
real possibility it's a couple million
dollars not not a hundred thirty
thousand let's get back to the couple
million dollars thing because that's
stunning language has no meaning anymore
right even though he literally went on
hannity and said this is what took place
we should have realized that what he
meant was these are rumors which i'm
creating about what took place it's not
actually what happened it's my opinion
as just a random guy about one
possibility of what might have happened
it's Orwellian doublespeak at its finest
and then at the end he throws that thing
in where he says listen 130,000 dollars
isn't even really big enough to be a
payoff for something serious anyway
this would have been if I was involved
in actually settling this it would have
been a couple million dollars that's not
a great thing to say that's exactly what
stormy Daniels was saying during the 60
Minutes interview which is she only
agreed to accept a hundred and thirty
thousand dollars because she was being
intimidated but she actually would have
wanted and potentially could have gotten
more based on the damage that she could
have done to Donald Trump before the
campaign it is a comedy of boneheaded
stupidity and then of course the final
question is well why hasn't Trump been
honest about all this but you don't go
away 430-thousand of a Meritor dude call
it a settlement payment the President
did make these payments to Michael Cohen
over the course of 2017 according to you
then why did on April 5th why did the
president deny any knowledge of the
payments when in fact well I don't know
I don't know when the president learned
about it he could have learned about it
after or not connected the whole thing
at at that time it was crazy
Trump was just so confused he had no
idea what was going on
this is gaslighting folks plain and
simple and it might be catalyzed by
incompetence in the people surrounding
Trump but the impact is gaslighting as I
have been discussing and this confuses
the average person apparently Trump was
also confused because Trump lied because
Rudy said Trump made the payment but
here's Rudy saying that the word of the
payment was just a rumor that he started
it's not actually something that he's
investigated it makes no sense and it's
makes such little sense that even Neil
Cavuto as I told you about earlier on
the program had to go out there and say
mr. president you're really not making
any sense here as soon as we heard that
North Korea was open to denuclearization
the comitted trumpets immediately said
wow Trump did it Trump gets the credit
here and my analysis immediately at the
time was yeah more than likely this is
something we can point to South Korea
for having influence on possible
behind-the-scenes influence from China
to the extent that it can be believed at
all that North Korea is actually in good
faith planning to denuclearize and I
also said that with North Korea it's
often in the wording and the semantics
and that something as seemingly
straightforward as we're ready for the
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula
could mean that North Korea is ready to
stop pursuing nuclear weapons as soon as
for example all American troops from the
nuclear nation of the United States of
America leave South Korea so that was
another factor but in any case what was
clear was that Trump had at best some
coincidental involvement in this
development now North Korea is straight
up saying what we're doing has nothing
to do with anything that Donald Trump
did this is the news from the weekend
let's see what North Korea said and then
we can sort of analyze it for what it's
worth
KCNA is the North Korean news agency
effectively a propaganda channel no
doubt about it they say that the US
should not be deliberately provoking nor
misleading the public by claiming that
Trump had a role because Trump had no
role in this so let's think through it
piece by piece
certainly even if Trump did play a role
in North Korea's seeming willingness to
denuclearize
it wouldn't be shocking if the North
Korean propaganda machine tried to deny
it merely for public relations purposes
but that being said there are trumpets
who immediately credited Trump for North
Korea's willingness to denuclearize who
are now simply saying you can't believe
what North Korea says well if you
believed the North Koreans 10 days ago
when they said they were going to
denuclearize why can't you believe them
now when they also say Trump also had
nothing to do with it but let's zoom out
for a moment and actually think through
on a different level is it that hard to
believe that some tweets from Trump
referring to Kim jong-un as Rocket Man
didn't solve a seventy-year-old problem
with North Korea like is that really so
hard to believe
we also learned after news of the
denuclearization pledge that North Korea
suffered the destruction of their
nuclear weapons testing facility and
that a ton of technical people even died
because of what took place there is it
possible that had more to do with the
need
denuclearization news than Trump's
randomly capitalized tweets and remember
it's really important not to understate
China here I said this last week the
Chinese president along with
consolidating power and eliminating term
limits in China recently did invite Kim
jong-un to China this was the first time
in something like seven years that Kim
jong-un had left North Korea and then a
few weeks after that meeting we hear
about the denuclearization pledge so any
sensible observer here would realize
that politics aside South Korea China
the implosion of North Korea's nuke test
facility those are really the driving
factors here not Donald Trump's tweets
and as a final note I care about being
accurate in placing blame and credit
merely for accuracy's sake but my top
priority as an end goal here is to
better the circumstances for the North
Korean people and I am willing to say
right now giving Donald Trump some
credit will fix the situation I'm not
saying that it will but if it would I
say give Trump credit let Trump take
credit if it allows some greater good
here it just doesn't seem to actually be
supported by any facts and in the end
the most important thing is that they go
through with denuclearization because it
would be a first step and only a first
step but an important one to the people
of North Korea being better off and
that's really my priority here whether
Donald Trump takes credit or gets credit
from Trump asur the South Korean foreign
minister or whoever there's of course
some objective reality about that will
we ever know it 100% with 100% accuracy
maybe not but what we should all be most
focused on is the well-being of the
North Korean people and the reduction in
threat to the people surrounding North
Korea as well which includes South Korea
it includes Americans in Guam and
includes China and Japan and so many
other parts of that region Quickbook
plug by the way if you're interested in
North Korea there is a great fiction
book that I've recommended in the past
and it is called the orphan masters son
by Adam Johnson it's a fiction book it's
a it's a novel but it is based around
Adam Johnson's extensive research and
knowledge of North Korea and it is an
amazing if if not brutal read but I do
highly highly recommend it to you okay
so if you watch or listen to our show
you probably already know that when I
open a story by saying hey there was a
rare moment of sanity on Fox News it's
almost always shepard smith and
sometimes like every once in a while it
will be chris wallace today's the
exception to that trend yes trump was
called out for his lies yes it was on
fox news yes it was a male anchor but it
was not Shep Smith and it was not Chris
Wallace it was actually Neil Cavuto
and the topic was the hundred and thirty
thousand dollars in hush money that
repayment admission from Rudy Giuliani
that we've talked about relating to
Trump's repayment of that hush money
Neil Cavuto did a monologue and called
what's going on out as lies but he
didn't actually use that word right but
we could all sort of understand what he
was saying Cavuto made it very clear
that the story is not making any sense
Trump denied any knowledge of it Rudy
Giuliani says Trump did pay back but
then sort of walks it back which we'll
talk about later it's just not making
any sense here is Neil Cavuto on Fox
News pointing this out president Trump
is fond of calling out the media on fake
news but is he the one giving them very
real ammunition maybe not intentionally
I'll even give you the benefit of doubt
mr. president say maybe not deliberately
but consistently way to consistently so
let me be clear mr. president how can
you drain the swamp if you're the one
who keeps muddying the waters you didn't
know about that $130,000 payment to a
porn star I think it did said you knew
nothing about how your former lawyer
Michael Cohen handle this until
acknowledging today you were the guy
behind the retainer payment that took
care of this you insist that money from
the campaign or campaign contributions
played no role in this transaction of
that your short thing is not even 24
hours ago sir you couldn't recall any of
this and you seem very sure now I'm not
saying you're a liar you're president
you're busy I'm just having a devil
time figuring out which news is they
let's just say your own words on lots of
stuff give me shall I'd say lots of
pause like the time you said the
Russians didn't interfere in the 2016
election until a lot of Republicans had
to remind you they did came back months
later and you said well I never said
that Russia didn't meddle in the
election when in fact you had a lot now
none of this makes me a never Trump er
just always confused like when you claim
your tax plan was the biggest in US
history when it wasn't or that the
building is signed to make it all happen
would cost you a fortune when it turns
out it is going to help make you a
bigger fortune or that your job approval
numbers really aren't that bad relative
to other presidents at this stage when
they're actually worse than most
presidents at this stage that can change
but what's weird is this pattern does
not so you get the idea this is probably
the best we can hope for on fox news
other than Shepard Smith and certainly
you know Neil Cavuto doesn't go far
enough here he's still using careful
language it's Fox News after all he's
not going to just say straight up this
guy's been lying to us and clearly
deliberately for a very long time but it
still is a move in the direction of even
Fox News getting to the end of what
they're willing to tolerate from Trump
and then of course predictable the Fox
News audience crushing Cavuto for even
meekly suggesting that maybe some of the
things are revered mr. president has
said might not have been accurate Fox
News viewers have been tweeting just
horrible things to Neil Cavuto calling
him a leftist liberal and a saying
they won't be watching his show anymore
enjoy your low ratings he needs to be
shipped out and the next day Kabuto had
to do sort of a clarification he spent
seven and a half minutes reading angry
tweets and responding to lots of them
individually and sort of saying hey
listen I'm not a never Trump or take a
look anyway fake news works both ways
Kenny so does consistency every fact I
presented last night was real every
comment I used from the president was
his not my words his words word for word
not my tweets his tweet nothing was fake
everything I shared was real no matter
the Bob emails you're a smug pompous
windbag I hope that you croak on that
pork chop tonight
wait a minute yeah the other thing to
bear in mind here is that just because
Neil Cavuto said some of the things our
president has been saying seem to be
inaccurate or inconsistent he and Fox
News don't deserve any journalism awards
right for timidly acquiescing to the
completely undeniable reality that
Trump's not being honest this is one of
the most dishonest presidents in history
the only reason it's notable is that Fox
News has been the propaganda machine for
Trump and if you're white waiting around
for Fox News to take this trend or take
this approach on all of its shows like
Fox and Friends I would not hold my
breath the problem with Fox News being
almost a 100 percent uninterrupted
stream of total propaganda is that you
tell the truth once here just basically
saying sometimes Trump's not 100% honest
and you get crushed and people get
really really mad so the best possible
scenario here is that maybe Fox is
starting to tear itself apart or eat
itself whatever analogy you want to use
the other is this might lead to a total
housecleaning at Fox News to get
everybody 100% on message either away
I'm super interested in watching what
happens on Fox News and you know I don't
watch a lot of MSNBC but a lot of people
think of MSNBC is the left-wing
equivalent of Fox News yeah if an MSNBC
host was critical of Barack Obama or
Hillary Clinton I would actually kind of
like it especially coming from them yeah
if they were being critical on the right
things but you never see that on Fox
News or at least not as much because the
committee Trump is just won't have it
not in the same way yeah and of course
Jen Kyogre from The Young Turks has the
story about how he when he was hosting
on MSNBC and there was a discussion or a
possible longer term job forum how one
of the things he was told was you got to
sort of step away a little bit from the
criticism of President Obama but towards
the end of Obama's presidency you
arguably saw more dissenting voices from
the left on MSNBC in a lot of ways we
are talking about two profit-driven
corporate news outlets whose editorial
positions are different but that dynamic
is one that is going to be very very
hard to break at Fox News especially if
their core profitable audience starts to
turn away because they start to say wait
a second we're not getting
the message that we were expecting and
hoping to get from FoxNews send me your
thoughts what's going on with Cavuto
what do you think is driving him to do
this because he could also just do
another segment right he didn't he
didn't have to do this story I'm on
Twitter at D Pakman and the show is on
Twitter at David Pakman show
in academic circles it's not really
controversial to say that tax cuts for
the rich don't trickle down to workers
you don't you don't really see that as a
controversial thing I've talked about
this hundreds of times on the show I've
explained the logic that tax cuts for
the rich and corporations are not an
incentive big picture to raise salaries
or hire more people because
fundamentally tax cuts for the rich and
David without any further ado why don't
you present your case sure well thanks
for having me first of all I think that
there's a couple different things that I
find sort of most interesting about
what's going on right now that I find to
be sort of encompassed primarily right
now by Robert Moeller's investigation
but really that goes beyond that as well
into sort of patterns involving Donald
Trump and his associates both during the
campaign and during the current
administration so I think that there's
sort of like a three pronged approach to
take here and you know to be super clear
I'm of course willing to have my mind
changed on on any of these things and I
I think that really figuring out my
ultimate goal is really just to figure
out what did happen what didn't happen
and most importantly were any crimes
committed so I think that to start with
the catalyst for what is now known as
Robert Moeller's special investigation
was the possibility that Donald Trump or
people involved with his campaign or
administration quote colluded with
Russia or individuals associated with
the Russian government in ways that
might have been illegal now we don't yet
know whether that did or didn't happen
and I don't I don't pretend that we know
but what I sort of focused on at this
point because again there's an
investigation going on right so we we
will by definition we don't know or at
least I hope we don't know everything
that Robert Muller knows there's a
couple different things to think about
number one is there's been a lot of
focus on the law not using the word
collusion and we've seen the narrative
shift from there was no collusion to
collusion isn't actually a crime and I
think that that's sort of a semantic
argument that's not really relevant here
right so I think that if we want to talk
about prong one which is quote collusion
we really need to think about well where
things are valued solicited implicitly
or explicitly from foreign nationals for
example in connection with with
elections if there's things of value
that have been solicited or that the
Trump administration was
interested in accepting that may be a
crime and again there's an investigation
going on we're gonna have to wait and I
think when we look at Donald Trump jr.
being offered quote dirt on Hillary and
responding if it's what you say I love
it especially later in the summer that
is certainly an openness to accept
materials of value from foreign
nationals and initially we were told
that the lawyer in question Natalia
vessel mats kaya has no connection to
the Kremlin we've since found out that
actually dating back many years she was
working with the Kremlin including on a
defense of a fraud case against the
Russian company and more recently
admitting that she was actually
reporting to a Russian government
official so there we basically have
effectively colloquially Donald Trump
jr. soliciting opposition research from
a foreign national for which there is
value opposition research something that
costs a lot of money we know that
because how much money Cambridge
analytical was paid for the work that
they were doing so that's an offer that
was clearly from someone that would be a
foreign national under the law it was
about Hillary Clinton meaning it's about
a US election so that that would be if
we want to talk about quote collusion
that's something I would look at pretty
directly in addition the other element I
think is important is that there was at
least the implied offer from Donald
Trump jr. to help work on a repeal of
the Magnitsky Act which put sanctions on
Russia that would be a quid pro quo and
again I'm not a lawyer we don't know
what Robert Muller knows but I've spoken
to lawyers who say that that also
escalates the the potential criminality
just as one more sort of element and
there's lots of these for this this
possible coordination we know that Trump
campaign advisor George papadopolis did
meet with a Russian agent who also said
he has dirt on Hillary Clinton later
bragged about Russia getting damaging
Clinton emails lied to the FBI about
contacts with Russia so while we will
not really know the full scope of
so-called collusion and I don't pretend
to know I think that there is more than
enough circumstantial evidence that this
should be in
negation and that's what I support right
I'm not making any claims about my
knowledge of specific crimes that didn't
happen but what I am saying is that
anyone who denies that the
circumstantial evidence warrants this
investigation I I disagree with however
then there's sort of like two other
prongs
there's the prong of whether there was
any criminality an attempt made to end
this investigation and once again this
is an ongoing investigation that's going
on were firings that took place possibly
crossing the line into criminal were
there conversations that took place that
could be considered witness tampering
and I present these once again as
questions because by definition this is
an ongoing investigation and this is why
I have a problem with the sort of
absolutist denialist who say their
definitive definitively were no crimes
period because we don't know that all we
have is the circumstantial information
which I would argue more than justifies
the investigation that's going on and
I'm glad to sort of delve more into the
the obstruction side of the conversation
and in the interest of sort of getting
to the third prong here there is no
doubt that it's legally well within
Robert Muller scope to explore any
possible crimes that he and his
investigators suspect may have been
committed as a result of the
investigation into both potential quote
collusion and obstruction and I I think
that there's no doubt at this point that
money-laundering is a very very high
probability when you look at a number of
different deals involving many many
different countries including countries
in the Middle East including Russia and
Russian individuals as well through
condo purchases potentially with
inflated values and whether that is part
of the Russia story or not sort of
depends on where you draw the line but
certainly there's no doubt that those
concerns for the Moller team have
stemmed from their initial investigation
and to sort of put a final point on it
and then I'm obviously super curious to
hear Ray's perspective on this I think
that a lot of what is going on
is self-inflicted by Donald Trump in the
sense that if from day one if the first
time that anything about Russia is
mentioned Donald Trump doesn't tweet
about it says simply I support the full
investigation I know I will be
vindicated and in the meantime I'm going
to work on my political agenda I think
anywhere from seventy to ninety percent
of what's going on now never happens and
it's been self-inflicted wound after
self-inflicted wound carried out by the
president so that's the the sort of
general overview of my position all
right thank you very much David Ray it's
your turn to talk to us for a few
minutes so the floor is yours well I
have to agree with David about
self-inflicted wounds on the part of
Donald Trump I mean you couldn't have a
worse a worst character to heap scorn on
himself he lies all the time
the question is what happened with
respect to Russian meddling so to speak
in the 2016 election and that's what
we're dealing with here we're not
dealing with whether these guys are
crooks I mean you have to be blind or
deaf and not to realize that you're
dealing with bunch of crooks
money laundry as the name of the game
what are they doing with manna fort well
they've got the book on writer fort and
so they say look metaphor you know we
can we can push your way for thirty five
years
um don't you remember doctor remember
Trump telling you about collusion with
with Russia if you could just remember
that oh yes think about if you could
remember that yeah bro we could probably
get you off with the six months
suspended sentence that's the way Muller
works the record is very clear when we
talk about crooks he's one of them it's
always call me so let me just backtrack
for a second and refer to the fact that
I've been watching Russian leaders for
over a half a century actually
fifty-five years it's almost exactly 55
years since I joined the CIA
an analyst of Soviet foreign policy so
watch Russian leaders look at the world
very very close way and when I think
about the 206 2016 election now here is
pushing or watching the campaign and
said his advisers around reducing oh my
god this Trump Wow what a character
he's unpredictable he brags about being
predictable and he lashes out at the
slightest slight whether it's real or
imagined oh man this is gonna be really
fun
this is just the guy I want to have with
his fingers on the nuclear codes I do
all we can to help them help them win
now if that sounds ridiculous it's
because it is ridiculous there is no no
suggestion in Russian statements or
Russian TV shows and I have people
watching this very closely to suggest
that there was a preference that there
was a preference to Donald for Donald
Trump
of a Hillary Clinton that's pretty much
the basic premise here now a sub subset
here is that quote everyone knew Hillary
Clinton would win
okay now Comey says that in his book I
call me explains that he felt he could
do the things he did which many of which
were clearly illegal clearly
unconstitutional because he was as he
put it he was it operating in an
environment where Hillary was going to
win and so what Hillary wins you know
who's gonna hold him to account for
taking wild liberties with the law and
the Constitution so no just to put it
into this point if Hillary is gonna win
if the New York Times had it 83%
that she was gonna win on the morning of
the election you're mr. poutine right
and you're sitting back there anything
my god uh everybody thinks he'll are you
gonna win but you know I think just for
fun yeah yeah that's what I think I'll
go I'll miss you
the DNC of the Democratic National
Committee computers and so I can find
you know she'll follow she'll find it
out and I won't be good for you should
be remorse toward me then but let's just
for fun
yeah suddenly give me a break there was
no percentage in poutine messing around
and the Democratic National Committee
computers so what do we have here we
have any evidence well no we don't all
we have his claims by corrupt people
working for the Democratic National
Committee and I have to say that what
David talked about opposition research
well yeah neglected to mention that
Hillary Clinton and the DNC played mega
paid mega bucks through a cutout to have
an ex UK spy do quote opposition
research turning up scurrilous detail
that even Comey admitted was scurrilous
about Trump cavorting with prostitutes
in Moscow well before he ever became a
candidate and you know it really is is
not quite right to talk about opposition
research without talking about both
sides so what we have here is a
situation where well I'll just I'll just
mention one other thing it's not widely
known we veteran intelligence
professionals for sanity will include by
the way too formal former technical
directors from the National Security
Agency the NSA we asked Obama formally
and a memorandum before he left office
would you please would you please make
clear what evidence there is that a the
russians hacked in to the DNC and be
they gave it to to WikiLeaks okay now it
turns out that what Obama said on the
18th of January just before two days
before he left office he said you know
the Russian heck so to speak in quotes
for my purposes
we don't know how it got the wiki leaks
at these conclusive results namely and
that NSA FBI CIA memorandum turned out
to be quote inconclusive in quote
Obama's words the other thing I'll just
mention is that in this spurious
memorandum which is an embarrassment to
intelligence analysis that I've been
with this problem 50 years the one that
they gave to to the president-elect of
the 6th of January there's a sort of a
left-handed compliment to WikiLeaks can
what they say is the reason the Russian
tank was given to WikiLeaks is because
of their of their reputation I'm not
fooling around with the information for
not shading it anyway but just putting
it out as is whoa so there's it there's
a reality here Julian Assange has never
ever been successfully criticized for
having molded or shaped or fixed what he
puts out it was all the real deal and
the last thing I'll say is what was the
real deal the real deal was the
Democratic National Committee documents
the emails that Julian Assange
advertised that he had on the 12th of
June 2016 and which he released in a
readily searchable manner on the 22nd of
July just three days before the
Democratic National Convention and what
did they say well people need to know
that what they said was that Hillary
Clinton stole the election from Bernie
Sanders it's pure it's pure that's give
me you know if you don't believe me why
did the white get the top five officials
of the National Democratic National
Committee quit on the spot okay that was
three days before the election okay
that's pretty embarrassing but what
happened
well groundwork had had already been
laid to divert attention and what was in
those emails to later the rush into it
why did the rush into it why would a
white arrest now even Hillary Clinton's
PR person Jennifer
Gary admitted but that was a really hard
sell a really hard sell until until we
got back to Brooklyn and what is
Jennifer Palmieri say then he says well
then we got intelligence people and
correspondents journalists in touch with
intelligence people and they gave us
they gave us the material about Russian
colluding with Russian and then the
Obama administration started I started
confirming that then we were off and
running and so that's that I heard this
personally from Jennifer Palmieri right
after the election so the whole thing
was prepared what what the situation
here is I would like to drive home is
that Russian collusion was initially
prepared as a magnificent distraction I
remember the movie magnificent obsession
well this is a magnificent distraction
what was in those emails and was in
those emails showed that Hillary stole
the nomination for Bernie Sanders so if
you're going to look at you know why why
we have this in my view of the worst
president the United States has ever had
in office you know you can lay that at
Hillary Clinton because had she not had
she not stolen the nomination for me
Sanders we would be looking at that
president Bernie Sanders now we would
not be looking at the terrible situation
both domestically and abroad
so you know don't blame the Russians for
God's sake without any evidence blame
Hillary Clinton all right ray thank you
very much David you have I don't know
reasonable amount how doesn't say three
minutes but there's no clock running a
reasonable amount of time to respond to
what ray just said yeah so listen it's
difficult in a sense to respond to what
Ray said because it has very very little
to do with any of what's actually going
on with Russia so let's see if I can
just look at a few of the points that
Ray made and a lot of these points I'm
having sort of a little bit of trouble
parsing the narrative because these
there were a lot of things that are just
kind of all over the place so first and
foremost ray
talked about the DNC primary being
rigged against Bernie Sanders and for
Hillary Clinton I I agree with him I
reported on that extensively I voted for
Bernie Sanders I don't know if Bernie
Sanders would have defeated Donald Trump
in a general election race it would have
been a different race but it has no
bearing whatsoever on for example the
Trump Tower meeting and its legality so
that's first and foremost the idea that
there is no sort of chain of custody of
hacked information between Russian
actors and the Trump campaign is just
patently untrue right we have extensive
reporting about the direct connection
between both Roger stone a Trump advisor
and Donald Trump jr.
and WikiLeaks Julian Assange we have
learned a great deal about the
intermediary between the hacker known as
gusoff err gucchy 42.0 and WikiLeaks and
we have extensive information about the
actions of that hacker who tried to
present himself as a Romanian individual
but indeed was actually a Russian
individual but again it has no actual
bearing on for example whether the Trump
Tower meeting was illegal ray also
mentioned that hey listen if you're
gonna talk about opposition research
which I did you also have to talk about
the fact that Hillary Clinton also
bought opposition research whether
Hillary Clinton also it opposition
research has no bearing whatsoever on
whether the Trump Tower meeting was
illegal or whether the firings that took
place to end the investigation by robert
muller constitute obstruction of justice
ray also talked about fired FBI director
James Comey and whether James Comey did
or didn't act in good faith it's a great
conversation to have it's one that I'm
I'm open to having but whether James
Comey did or didn't act in good faith is
simply not an argument that relates to
what the Trump campaign objectively did
and ray started his presentation by
saying that Russian leaders who he's
been following for a very very long time
have always tried to sow chaos in
Western democracies
that's absolutely true if you look at
Alexander
Dugan's book the foundations of
geopolitics from 1997 you see that this
has been the Russian mo for a very long
time but again it is simply not an
argument that negates or refutes any of
the facts that I put forward so I think
that what Rey has brought up are all
interesting topics and relevant in a
certain context but they in no wait may
actually relate to what we're discussing
today and finally and then I'll turn
this over Tom the idea that the steel
dossier had only inaccuracies in it has
been widely debunked and every week we
learn about another element of that
dossier that has actually been confirmed
the Carter page trips to Moscow and
meetings with Russian officials my
Cancun's role in pursuing business
opportunities for Trump in Russia the
allegations that were initially denied
by Trump that he had spent several
nights in Moscow in 2013 around that
pageant which was initially completely
denied by Trump we now know from
airplane records that it's actually true
in other words every week another
element of the steel dossier is
confirmed to be true so I on the facts
that that Ray tried to assert to
contradict me I think he's wrong on the
fact and then most of what he said just
doesn't actually relate to the
discussion today all right ray now you
it's great to welcome Jason Murphy back
to the program he's an anti-poverty
activist and an assistant professor of
philosophy at Elms College in Western
Massachusetts
he serves on the National Committee of
the u.s. basic income guarantee Network
and is also a media outreach organizer
for the basic income earth Network Jason
it's so great to have you back I think a
good place to start would be from the
last time you've been on what has
happened with some of the basic income
experiments that have been done notably
Finland is going to be wrapping up their
experiment we talked about that on the
program earlier in the week how in
general would you say these experiments
have been going well they've been very
very interesting as a generator of news
and discussion on basic income there's
one in the works in Ontario I was one in
the works in Barcelona the finish one
generated a surprising amount of
attention there was a wave of news that
declared incorrectly that Finland had
implemented basic income and some
newspapers described the program one way
and some described another and of course
it's actually not true a few thousand
people in Finland received a guaranteed
income if they went and got a job they
would still have it and the government
was mainly only interested in it as a
social science experiment and they're
ending it on schedule the sociological
or economic research wing of the
governments called Kela Kela they're
going to be studying the data they've
issued no findings but you'll find a
tremendous amount of opinion columns and
even what looks like a news article
declaring Oh Finland has rejected it and
they just plain heaven yeah and one of
the things Jason I found interesting was
that there was sort of some ambiguity in
the reporting a lot of the reporting
around that as we discussed on the
program earlier in the week said that
there were people who were displeased
with the idea that you didn't even have
to be looking forward
in order to receive the 560 euros that
were sort of part of this test scenario
and some of that was misreported as sort
of like a finding of the of the test
right and it's sort of like my thought
was yeah the entire point of ubi is that
there is no means-testing there's no
sort of like required activity for it
that's what the test is and the
criticism that it's a disincentive to
look for work is not a specific
criticism to the Finnish test that's
like a criticism of unemployment or of
ubi and other social welfare insurance
that is beyond the scope of this
particular program so I think the
reporting was very confusing on it oh
yeah well essentially you're right so if
someone's displeased they're displeased
with the idea basic income we're
receiving we're communicating with a lot
more people a lot more interest in basic
income since we last spoke the people
just know the effect basic income would
have on work but the government in
Finland is not my kind of government
that's a austerity rather conservative
government they were hoping and they're
looking into see that basic income would
be an incentive to look to work because
no one's worried about losing their
funding so all they replaced in their
experiment was unemployment benefits so
it was just not it was just not a early
version of a basic income regime that's
gonna require an ethical commitment we
have to make a decision that we want to
wipe out poverty and we see how to do it
basic income is definitely one of the
strongest proposals out there and the
United States it's about there would be
about four percent maybe five of the
gross domestic product and everyone is
above the official poverty line and then
we can look around and see what else we
need to do but that's not something
where we need this immense amount of
social scientific data if your town
could see an increase
income why would you say oh no no let's
go experiment on a few hundred people
first no you do the thing that raises
your average income well to play devil's
advocate I mean one of the arguments
that's made and it's a very similar
argument that's a that's made against
increases to the minimum wage if you
subscribe to supply-side economics is
that if everybody gets call it eight
thousand dollars it doesn't matter the
amount eight thousand dollars for the
year or ten thousand or six thousand
whatever whatever it is if everybody
gets that then all prices and costs
associated with living will just sort of
be upwardly adjusted by roughly those
same six eight or ten thousand dollars
per year and in the net it's not
actually going to improve quality of
life it'll just cause inflation how do
we fight against that talking point well
now there we have data like so pretty
number crunchy economist so business
professors say the kind of stuff you're
talking about you know conservative
opinion columnist they'll say that the
devil's advocate thing you're bringing
in here but economists do not fear
increases an average income so what
happens if you have cash that you can do
whatever you want with you can look
around for better deals some people are
spending more on groceries because they
live in an area that has only one
grocery store with a little bit of money
that's yours you can get to the next
grocery store that's just one example it
would work the same with pharmacy things
like that so a lot of people are gonna
get better prices because they can use
some resources to go get the better
prices also I mean there may be some
increase in pricing it would be weird
they would defy conventional economics
but also most rebellious economics it
would defy them if say twelve thousand
dollars a year as a basic income ended
up cost
everybody that much sure yeah right the
exact numbers of course may not shake
out that way I mean I guess the example
that is sometimes pointed to his
Switzerland right Switzerland has a very
high standard of living and even jobs
that in in the United States would be
minimum wage or barely minimum wage earn
a significantly higher we would call it
sort of a living wage and people point
to it's really really expensive to live
in Switzerland I sort of experienced
this firsthand visiting the country a
few times there is certainly sticker
shock there that's sort of the example
that people will point to which is hey
we kind of know what happens when the
average income is significantly higher
things cost what they cost in
Switzerland and everyone's happier and
they live longer
that's very true right people seem
pretty happy with the set up in
Switzerland don't they I mean and but so
I think that's sure I mean there may
well be the case that some of these
things happen again we're gonna have
more options so there may be may have an
easier time moving somewhere or housings
cheaper if we don't need both people to
hold on to that job without a crisis we
may be surprised by some of the effects
of basic income but it's going to come
as a product of choices we make with
assets we now have right this is like
we're distributing assets and not just
entitlements minimum wage increases have
not typically had these massive
increases in essentials like prices and
rent and things like that correct we get
data there we have state lines or
there's different minimum wages on both
sides so you know there may be some
effect but raising minimum wage to you
know $15 an hour movement is really
gonna deliver just a better standard of
living for the least well-off but for
the least well-off that are employed do
you think Jason that a lot of what we're
seeing in terms of the opposition is
more ideological
because the idea of a non means-tested
program that gives money to people is
actually not that unusual when you look
at the details right like in Alaska it's
widely known that there's this fund that
distributes money to residents based on
the money that comes in through oil and
gas returns right drilling in the in the
state etc you get that just for living
there and people don't some of the same
people who say that something like
universal basic income encourages
laziness don't really ever say anything
about that program in Alaska which we
already have here in the United States
so is it really the idea of this that's
a problem we also need a movement we
need to push for seeing basic income as
something that fights poverty which in
Alaska no one has really pushed to make
it do that it was implemented by a
governor who did what Tobias poverty but
he had to really fight to get any of it
in at all and it's typically been
something of an afterthought nobody has
said wow we could really build this
thing so it could have a long time ago
then much bigger in Alaska it is proof
that it's doable the idea that well if
when I first started working on basic
income I was surprised how many people
thought it must be impossible and I
would have to just point to Alaska to
prove you can do any of it the new
question now because people can they've
heard enough about it right I'm not the
first person bringing it up people have
heard enough about it
where they know it's probably doable
we're wondering what the consequences
might be
how much do I really exploit the
insecurities of other people and I've
had nominal lefty types saying well
who's gonna clean up the building right
and these are folks who will tell you
how liberal and left they are but
suddenly they're worried
that they're gonna have to pay a little
more to get people to do things because
they're not worried about starving
anymore
that's incredible and given especially
how much more wealthy we are than we
used to be we have more to share than
we've ever ever had it doesn't seem that
way like if you're viewing and you're
thinking no way
it's because it's not getting shared
there's more to share it's not good
share
so it's just kind of incredible that we
would think of still using desperation
right let's write of eviction or not
being able to pay for medicine
I want everybody who works around me to
oh I want the job to be something that
makes sense to them works in their plan
and it doesn't have to be utopian we
just need a little bit there so that
between jobs people are gonna be ok and
again it's four to five percent of the
GDP being looks like it would secure
twelve thousand a year for everyone
let's pause the conversation there were
speaking with Jason Murphy about
universal basic income we will pick it
up with him tomorrow much more to
discuss
we're continuing our conversation with
Jason Murphy who is an anti-poverty
activist assistant professor of
philosophy at Elms College in western
Massachusetts serves on the National
Committee of the u.s. basic income
guarantee network he's also a media
outreach organizer for the basic income
Earth Network so Jason next thing I want
to talk about is something I've
discussed on the program before which is
that we want to responsibly advocate for
programs like universal basic income and
in being responsible it's important to
take into account that people like Mark
Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos of Amazon and
Bill Gates and many many tech
billionaires really seem to like the
idea of ubi
and that doesn't mean that they like it
necessarily four motives of self
enrichment but when there's something
that a lot of tech billionaires like the
idea of it's good to think about why
that is so has that trend for you made
you cautious about really thinking
through how such a program would work
what do you make of the tech
billionaires that seem to love it well
it's been interesting
so us basic income guarantee Network I
was getting together before Silicon
Valley started talking about it in the
way that we've seen quite a bit the last
couple years so it's been a clash of
cultures in some ways why are they
backing it I think it's important to
note that the majority of Silicon Valley
wealthy are not backing it we're doing a
lot from them but the 1% are not
rallying around basic income we'd have
it if they were so why are some looking
into it maybe it's because they want to
look smart maybe it's because they
actually do depend on a market this is a
way of expanding markets that they're
good at tending to so in the same way
that Ford Henry Ford needed higher waged
workers
to be able to sell cars it's very likely
that a basic income could create the
kind of consumers that the figures you
name Zuckerberg etc might be able to
sell too well the Amazon one is I think
you're making a very good point with
because when you consider like a hundred
million people or something are Amazon
Prime subscribers which means that for
the hundred bucks a year they get free
two-day shipping on whatever they want
from Amazon if all of a sudden you have
an extra eight ten or twelve thousand
dollars in your pocket and those aren't
eight ten or twelve thousand dollars
that you need in order to merely eat or
have a place to live it does stand to
reason that a significant portion of
that might go into buying stuff on
Amazon and getting it shipped for free
in two days to your house right oh sure
and the one percent can only buy so many
whatever it is we're doing on Amazon
which can be things like razors and you
know socks and jerk so there is a point
where the 90% really start to matter
more to some of the figures we name I
think some of the actual proposals that
are written down there's some detail we
got a look at those because some of the
ones coming out of Silicon Valley are
really different from other ones coming
out so some of them are very libertarian
in nature they only want to dismantle
current support and then there's an idea
that whatever money we save by
dismantling whether it's SSI food stamps
etc and just put it into a basic income
that would be a bad deal that's
overestimating the amount of support
that's out there and when you only need
four to five percent of the GDP to
that's what the numbers look like to
guarantee twelve thousand a year for
everyone it seems to me very silly to
have to cut all this others support in
order to fund it but that's not what
we're seeing with some of them if I can
just to do the few things I want to
touch on here and we're starting to get
a little bit tight on time there are
those who are suggesting something like
a job guarantee program as an
alternative to ubi
or more commonly a negative income tax
which would be a progressive tax and
thus only apply to individuals making
you know below a certain amount and the
idea is that the money would be better
spent rather than just giving a set
amount to everybody even though that's
bureaucratically simple that the
stimulative effect would be greater if
the money was applied where it is most
needed
do you believe number one that the that
these are interchangeable ideas and
number two what do you think the
negatives would be of looking at
something like negative income tax
versus a flat ubi well I'm I'm excited
to see more people considering programs
that guarantee everybody access to an
asset that includes the job guarantee
the idea that the government would see
itself as an employer of last resort and
we're seeing people back there so that's
exciting a negative income tax would get
to people it would be a guarantee if
suddenly I have no income as long as I
can get somewhere quickly right if I
quit my job because it's horrible right
my job is good if someone quits their
job because of injustice in the
workplace I want I want them to not I
want them to be able to live until they
get the next job so as long as that
that's not to me that's not bureaucracy
that's kind of one of the things I'm
hopeful about basic income with there's
versions of negative income tax that
would do that again a lot of it has to
do with the details how many people how
high does the income have to be before
it cuts off if you're progressively
funding a basic income the 1% is going
to be paying more in than they get out
so mathematically it can be very similar
to negative income tax so again I'll
read the the details I like Andrew
Yang's proposal I like this Hughes's I
like I would love to see a tax on
pollution traffic
financial transactions things like that
so that we can tamp down things that are
hurting us and help people that need it
I really want people to know they have
it that they have this income as an
asset to me that's worth any other
problems but again if you count the net
costs a lot of descriptions of how much
basic income cause go with the total
cost the gross cost the net costs it's
three to four percent I needed to get
everyone twelve thousand what about the
argument that's made about negative
income tax that it would be easier to
make up a reality politically on the
basis that you don't need to create
anything new you simply adjust tax rates
which is done you know every four eight
or however many years every however many
years we have political decisions made
around that and that it would be simpler
to implement with the infrastructure we
have do you think that that's a good
argument in favor of a negative income
tax but a basic income is the similar
infrastructure it can be done just as
well on the 1040 form we just have the
grant right there you know here's the
amount you get and then the 1040 form
calculates what we charge in tax it can
be done through Social Security as well
we already have the infrastructure for
basic income with both negative income
tax and basic income and job guarantee
if there's a bunch of people endorsing
it and sponsoring it then I'll say oh
yeah that's the program that has the
political will behind it and I wish all
of them well I still want to know I to
me the guarantee is important because I
want people to be able to switch around
switch life plans I want people to have
this independence the basic income gives
them because I think will bargain better
at work I think will build new
organizations new businesses things that
we actually want some of them may be
collectively owned I think we're gonna
take option
that are pretty exciting if we really
know we have the income if it takes
another step to get in there if I have
to convince someone I actually need the
money
hey I once to have this income now I
don't I'm worried we're gonna even if we
really would get it rumors get out when
I organize low income people so many
people believed that they're just not
gonna get something like food stamps
right even if they really would and they
all thought oh they're getting food
stamps but we're not so there's
something about these conditional
programs that lose trust and that's one
reason why for me the simplicity of the
dividend yeah citizens dividend is
another word for basic income another
I like covering what's happening in the
news media world and one of the sort of
more interesting stories of the last
couple years has been megyn kelly who
started in media as a news reporter
after working as an attorney she then
became a contributor on Fox News she
ultimately got her own program on Fox
News and then she had this very public
spat would then candidate Donald Trump
where it was ultimately announced that
she'd be leaving Fox News to develop
programming for NBC News which would
include a weekly Sunday night program as
well as a daytime talk show and
immediately it was obvious that this was
a very clearly big big money for her
NBC News was sort of making a play on
Megyn Kelly's name rather than her
specific skill set or the demographic
that she appeals to and it was clear
that these weren't really her key
competencies or her sort of
bread-and-butter when it comes to format
and NBC News but a huge amount of money
on her right three year 69 million
dollar contract crazy money but it has
been a total unmitigated disaster and it
keeps getting worse and back in October
we talked about it I told you things
weren't going well her nighttime
interview show they got Vladimir Putin
which was a big deal but otherwise
totally flopped they made a huge deal
out of their major blockbuster interview
with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones not
exactly the person you'd imagine a
program with this budget and this amount
of fanfare on corporate media would tout
as like a major get as one of their
first guests Alex Jones her daytime show
did okay for like a week then lost half
a million viewers within that at the end
of that first week and a lot of it was
Meghan Kelley just didn't seem authentic
in this format and it has continued to
get worse and worse since we talked
about this in October and there's a
really interesting Wall Street Journal
article about it now let's remember Wall
Street Journal is owned by News
Corporation News Corporation owns Fox
News could they be writing a negative
article about megyn kelly because of
sour grapes it's possible but they're
making fact-based points and the
fact-based points are continued really
low ratings on the daytime show which
have local NBC affiliates unhappy
staffers on other NBC shows reportedly
upset about how much money
Megan Kelly's show gets despite the
horrible ratings Hollywood agents
reportedly are telling their clients not
to even go on Megyn Kelly's show because
of low ratings and because of this
really weird incident where megyn kelly
interviewed Jane Fonda not for very long
it was a short interview and chose to
ask Jane Fonda about plastic surgery and
it did not go well and then the
nighttime show which I'm barely talking
about I'm barely talking about it
because it's been all but canceled
there's no weekly nighttime show anymore
it's an occasional special episode like
a primetime special type of thing so was
this a mistake for megyn kelly I don't
know I mean financially not at all right
69 million for three years that's great
for her financially the problem is that
if she carries herself if she carries
her worth on more than just ratings and
on prestige then arguably this is a big
mistake
NBC seems to have really been the one
that made the mistake here right NBC
calculated that her personality
justified this amount of money and it
seems that this is bigger than megyn
kelly it seems like personality doesn't
drive corporate news shows to the tune
of 69 million dollars over three years
right there's no question that the big
personalities on corporate media do
Drive revenue but is it to the point of
69 million for three years apparently
not and corporate news ratings in
general have been down as there are more
alternatives independently and on the
Internet
some of Megyn Kelly's Fox News
demographics they don't really translate
to daytime talk shows right typically
the people that are watching the nine PM
partisan Fox News primetime show or
10:00 p.m. whatever time she was on
those are not the same people watching
daytime talk and who would even
potentially be in Megyn Kelly's audience
so this has not worked well for NBC
megyn kelly is going to be fine
financially but I'm curious about the
future of this format bigger picture I'm
also curious how much longer NBC is
gonna allow the daytime show to continue
right I wonder what megyn kelly will do
after this three-year contract is up
yeah will and NBC re-sign are probably
for less money if they do
I don't think she can go back to Fox
News especially because there's probably
bad blood there she did write something
negative about Roger Ailes who allegedly
you know well he did actually I mean he
doesn't allege she was actually well
actually keep there were payoffs but of
course he passed away that I don't think
that their world to me any interpreted
proceedings there
yes but Roger Ailes by all accounts
massive payoff to gretchen carlson and
and other women i think she doesn't go
back to fox news for sure i think it's
possible that she gets shifted around in
NBC News she could maybe get reframed as
sort of just a news reader maybe she
becomes the next like half-hour news
person on NBC News but certainly a for
me the most interesting thing has been
whether or not she is a right-wing
ideologue the right-wing ideologue
character that she played on Fox News
does seem to have hurt her potential at
these news new programs so total
implosion of Megyn Kelly's new shows
both shows in fact okay I wasn't going
to talk about michelle wolf and the
White House Correspondents Dinner since
we normally don't really say much about
it but the scandal around it has made me
want to have a conversation about it and
what was notable this this year about
the White House Correspondents Dinner
was that Trump didn't attend normally
the president goes they get roasted to
some degree and they generally take it
pretty well Michelle wolf headlined the
event in Trump's absence she made jokes
some were aggressive some were less
aggressive some were very funny some
were not as funny but she's getting
absolutely crushed by conservative media
and even some on the not right like not
left wingers per se but even just sort
of some general media criticism is
saying that maybe michelle wolf went too
far and the normal MO with these things
is the people being made fun of it's
usually the president people in the
current administration sometimes media
as well they sort of all take it in
stride right because it doesn't look
good when you don't and then the
partisan al analysts from the
administration's party will slam the
comedian is going too far or being too
aggressive or being insensitive or
distasteful when it was Obama you'd hear
a little bit of that from the left but
mostly it was understood that this is
comedy right it's comedy and it's comedy
period the right has absolutely lost its
mind over Michelle Wolf's joke saying
everything from it was bullying that was
Mike Huckabee who said that - it was
cruel unfair disgusting inaccurate and
this is so funny on so many levels first
and foremost being the same free speech
warriors who were supposedly against the
trigger warnings and the safe spaces are
effectively totally triggered by
michelle wolf and arguing that she just
went too far and they wanted in practice
the White House Correspondents Dinner to
be a safer space for them than it was I
mean just a glaring hypocrisy but I
thought we should actually look at what
Michelle Wolf said because what really
seems to be getting to them is that
everything Michelle Michelle wolf said
other than like the clearly sarcastic or
joking comments was true right she
opened with a joke about a porn star
having sex with Trump that happened or
at least there's every indication that
it happened she said Congress
accomplishes very little that's true
most people in the United States degree
she said that at age 32 she's 20 years
older than the age that would make Roy
Moore find her attractive more hasn't
denied pursuing girls not that much
older than 12 right it's an edgy joke
but it's a fine joke to be making she
referred to Michael Cohen writing a
hundred and thirty thousand dollar check
to someone he did that what's the big
deal she joked about the liberal media
being turned on by the Trump Russia
collusion story that's a critique of
liberal media why would conservatives be
mad about that
she said Hillary wasn't in contact with
Michigan that's a critique of Hillary
Clinton's campaign she joked about Trump
phoning into Fox & Friends
he does phone into Fox & Friends all the
time why is that a big deal she joked
about maybe Trump isn't as rich as he
says he is well we know that that's
something that bothers Trump it's not
original material others have suggested
that she said Trump is a racist I mean
yeah that's a matter of debate but it's
not really unique or controversial at
this point to say that Trump has racist
tendencies she suggested that a Trump
impeachment might be bad because it
would lead to Mike Pence who's worse
I've been saying that and many others
have been saying that for more than a
year I don't see how that's offensive
she joked about people being against
abortion until their secret mistress
needs an abortion that's a real story
about many Republicans and even some
anti-choice Democrats when it comes to
abortions only for their mistresses and
not for anybody else she joked about
Republicans having not see candidates
that just happened in Illinois that
actually is a real thing
she said Kellyanne Conway lies that's
undeniably true she said Ivanka has done
nothing as a women's rights advocate I
would agree with that and then she got
into Sarah Huckabee Sanders and this
made a lot of people mad she joked that
Sarah Huckabee Sanders is like aunt
Lydia in a Handmaid's Tale she accused
Sarah Huckabee Sanders of constant lying
she joked about Sarah Huckabee Sanders
being a disappointment to women is this
really that bad like you would only
really be triggered by that if you
recognize that it's all completely true
and then she made a joke about Sarah
Huckabee Sanders Smokey Eye Makeup and
people said well as she's starting to
make fun of Sarah Huckabee Sanders
appearance give me a break
they should all be thrilled that that's
the full extent to which Sarah Huckabee
Sanders appearance was ridiculed right
and I've been very clear I think Sarah
Huckabee Sanders is terrible for the
lies that she tells but one could if
they wanted to as Trump did to many of
his opposing Republican candidates
ridicule the way they look
joked about Fox News having a problem
with predators of women I mean that that
is true that's true
made some jokes about Rachel Maddow
that's not even about the ride she said
Trump is so broke that he grabs
looking for loose change I mean that
that relates to news stories if this is
offensive speech to Republicans they are
even more thin-skinned than we thought
and we thought they were pretty damn
thin-skinned and I feel like if there is
legitimate criticism to make here it's
that these aren't really jokes for the
most part there were just like
observations about reality yes and I
think that's why comedians nowadays are
having such a tough time in the era of
Trump because reality is already pretty
hilarious so there's nowhere to take it
I mean you can't like flip it you can't
make it satirical you can't exaggerate
it and then they could argue that it
wasn't funny that would be a criticism
but most people don't get offensive by
things that aren't funny they just don't
laugh and then move on
their lives so it appears that what the
right really hated about Michelle wolf
speech was that it contained mostly the
truth there's one other angle here which
is that because Michelle wolf did go
after corporate media in a lot of ways
corporate media may have decided to
enable Michelle Wolf's critics to come
on and slam her because she slammed them
during her jokes that's another possible
angle which is interesting yeah it could
be a silver lining that this could take
down the White House Correspondents
Dinner they're actually talking about
getting rid of the comedy not only over
this incident but also Stephen Colbert's
roasting of George W Bush yeah that
would be a great thing I think the
Correspondents Dinner is a little bit
too cozy between the media and those in
charge so well I'd like to see them get
rid of it listen you got rid of the
president this year they can get rid of
the jokes next year what will be left I
guess just like a a dried fish dish that
gets served to everybody in the room I
don't know what else they'll have we
have a major story today to lead with
and it sort of goes directly to possible
crimes committed by President Donald
Trump and his campaign but it also goes
to corporate media effectively falling
hook line and sinker for what was
clearly a calculated decision that was
made and this all relates to the sum of
a hundred and thirty thousand dollars
which was paid to adult film actress
stormy Daniels by Trump's personal
attorney Michael Cohen and to give you
the 15-second reset on the story Donald
Trump allegedly had an affair with
stormy Daniels years ago close to
Election Day 2016 she was paid a hundred
and thirty thousand dollars in hush
money
she was also asked to sign a
nondisclosure agreement and the story
that we've been told so far is that the
hundred and thirty thousand dollars came
not from Donald Trump nor from Donald
Trump's campaign which would potentially
be illegal but from Michael Cohen
Trump's lawyer personally and that
Donald Trump neither knew about the
payment nor the non-disclosure agreement
nor did he ever repay Michael Cohen the
hundred and thirty thousand dollars this
was unbelievable from day one right
first and foremost because Donald
Trump's name is on the non-disclosure
agreement Trump didn't sign it
but in principle how can people be
parties to contracts they don't know
exists doesn't really make any sense and
in addition to that it was always hard
to believe that the hundred and thirty
thousand dollars which Michael Cohen had
to mortgage his house to obtain were
never returned to him by the billionaire
Donald Trump it always seemed like a
legal and PR manipulation to claim that
Cohen paid the money just out of the
goodness of his heart out of love for
Donald Trump as Michael Cohen's attorney
said to megyn kelly a few weeks ago well
in comes Rudy Giuliani former New York
City Mayor one of the latest additions
to Donald Trump's legal team which is a
legal team that's been constantly in
flux since it was put together and
Giuliani goes on Fox News last night and
he says oh yeah a Donald Trump did pay
Michael Cohen back for the hundred and
thirty thousand dollars which obviously
contradicts the idea that Trump didn't
know about the payment
it obviously contradicts the idea that
Donald Trump didn't pay Michael Cohen
back which is what we were told and
hypothetically it means that there could
have been a crime depending on whether
the source of that money was Donald
Trump personally or the Trump campaign
but it also potentially eliminates some
other crimes so let's get to the video
clip here is Rudy Giuliani on Fox News
last night I was talking about the
hundred thirty thousand dollar payment
right a settlement payment which is a
very regular thing for lawyers to do the
question there was the only possible
violation there would be was it a
campaign finance violation but usually
were result in a fine by the way not
this big storm of storm troopers coming
in and breaking down his apartment and
breaking out his office that was money
that was paid by by his lawyer the way I
would do out of his law firm funds or
whatever funds doesn't matter the
president reimbursed that over a period
of setting me it said it didn't I will I
distinctly remember that he did it on
his own he did without asking look I
don't know I haven't investigated that
no reason to dispute that no reason is
for the recollection I like Michael a
lot you like Michael oh yeah I feel very
bad he's been victimized like this the
president feels even worse by the way
again Sean Hannity saying he's known ko
in awhile without mentioning he actually
worked with Michael Cohen but
that's that's not even gonna that's not
gonna rate today rudy giuliani after
this interview told the New York Times
that this isn't just something he's
saying but that he has documents which
show that Donald Trump did make this
payment so the obvious question is why
admit this all along Trump claimed that
he didn't pay him back didn't know about
it seems like an unforced error right
wrong this is a calculation much like
the calculation with Russia collusion
remember there was no collusion shifted
into a narrative of if there was
collusion it wouldn't be a crime and it
wouldn't be illegal anyway among some
right and here they are obviously
calculating it's better for them to
shift from there was no repayment to
repayments for settlements are totally
normal
obviously any client is going to repay
their lawyer for a settlement that was
made and part of the calculation is that
Trump astaire that Trump directly lied
about this it is not a slight distortion
it's a straight-up lie right let's be
super clear Trump was asked specifically
aboard Air Force One last month did you
know about the payment to stormy Daniels
and Donald Trump said no and said talk
to Michael Cohen he was then asked do
you know where he got the money to make
that payment and Donald Trump said no I
don't know rather than well yeah he got
it from me because I paid him back
Giuliani isn't stupid he is a hyper
partisan guy he has said a lot of things
that don't make a lot of sense but he's
not stupid and clearly there's been a
determination made here that the legal
danger is bigger if Trump doesn't repay
if tump Trump didn't repay Cohen because
that would potentially raise more legal
issues than the idea that hey this is
just a client paying back their lawyer
it was alone it was a prepaid settlement
money whatever right as long as Trump
didn't pull the money from his campaign
fund it wouldn't be illegal and the
calculation that was made and I believe
it was accurately made is that framing
Trump as a liar is the best thing here
because he's never been held to account
by his supporters for lying all the time
about everything what's just one more
lie right and then now the next step in
this is Trump tweeting and shifting the
story again saying it wasn't even really
a repayment specifically for the hundred
thirty thousand dollars Trump just
regularly paid retainers to his attorney
Michael Cohen this is actually genius
check out this series of three tweets
this morning where Donald Trump said mr.
Cohen an attorney received a monthly
retainer not from the campaign and
having nothing to do with the campaign
from which he entered into through
[Music]
the david pakman show at david
pakman.com there are some breathless
reports being published that say that
North Korean leader Kim jong-un has
agreed to meet Donald Trump at the DMZ
which is the Demilitarized Zone right at
the border between North and South Korea
on the Korean Peninsula and much like
other North Korea related news it's
being reported as if this is some major
unbelievable development but wasn't it
always sort of obvious that that's where
Kim jong-un would want to meet Donald
Trump more than likely we talked at the
very beginning of the sort of
possibility of the summit taking place
about how Kim jong-un said that he's
willing to meet with President Trump as
if it was big news North Korean leaders
have been desperate to get in the same
room as American presidents in order to
elevate their perceived status going
back a very very long time it wasn't
news and along the same lines this time
the notion that it's big news that Kim
jong-un would be willing to have the
meeting at the DMZ really isn't news and
Trump has been tweeting about this
yesterday he tweeted numerous countries
are being considered for the meeting but
would peace house / freedom house on the
border of North and South Korea be a
more representative important and
lasting site than a third-party country
just asking the other idea was Singapore
Singapore is a place that might not be
obvious why you would have the meeting
in Singapore but Singapore is a place
where the American military has a
presence but there's also a diplomatic
relationship between Singapore and North
Korea as well as a North Korean embassy
so it's one of a sort of smaller subset
of places that would meet both of those
requirements but from a logistics
perspective it's pretty logical for Kim
Jong
own to want to meet at the DMZ right it
allows his team to get set up for the
meeting without dealing with the
possible diplomatic yes we can call them
complexities of traveling around the
world to different places where the
relationship with North Korea may not be
quite so good but really it's the PR and
the propaganda value here combined with
Kim Jong Un's maybe paranoia that
someone might try to do something to him
if you went somewhere else that
immediately pointed to the DMZ is the
place where Kim jong-un would want to
meet and that's the thing about a
meeting at the DMZ because it makes it
so that whatever comes out of the
meeting
getting Donald Trump they're getting him
maybe to step over the line from south
to north korea and shake hands with kim
jong-un the propaganda value the
self-aggrandizing value of that for kim
jong hoon is absolutely huge and quite
frankly it's huge for Trump as well
right Trump would love to have video of
himself doing this going to the DMZ
stepping over the line
shaking can't hands with Kim jong-un
regardless of what actually is even
agreed to in principle at the meeting
and regardless of what actually happens
longer term which we've talked about no
matter what's agreed to at the meeting
we actually have to see what the
follow-through is because there's a long
history of talk and no real action or
not the action that we're hoping for
that would be huge for Trump as well and
not that this is my primary concern
would the Secret Service be okay with a
meeting at the DMZ I mean they like to
get in clear the entire surrounding area
from where the president will be as far
as we know it's hard to imagine came
jong-un saying Secret Service sure come
in to the North Korean side and control
access to the border area how do they
prevent for example I don't know a North
Korean sniper from having a clear view
of Trump during this meeting so
obviously there's no doubt that trying
to kill the president if you're North
Korea would be immediate suicide I'm not
saying they would do it but I'm
explaining why security concerns for
Secret Service would be significant in
terms of a meeting at the DMZ but the
fact that we're talk
about a meeting between an American
president and a North Korean leader at
the DMZ is already huge that I think is
really the most important thing we
talked yesterday how much credit does
Trump deserve we're not gonna rehash
that today and I think a lot of that
will sort of be known in retrospect but
I am actually finding to do this to be
one of the most interesting geopolitical
stories and I'm not it's not a value
judgment of Trump in a way regardless
this is going to be a fascinating month
do you think that this could get Donald
Trump the Nobel Peace Prize
trumpets they're talking about that even
the South Korean president is talking
about that it's the interesting idea to
float but I don't know we'll have to see
it's funny how trumpets are all about
America first and only our opinion
matters until South Korea now thinks
that Trump is responsible for the
progress that's been made and we know
that South Korea is one of in the in the
entire world is one of the most Pro
Trump countries and I would wait until
we have more information before jumping
in with South Korea on that I think I
would also wait on the Nobel Peace Prize
I think again it would depend on what is
Trump's actual involvement and
responsibility here which we don't know
well after the Camp David Accords Bagan
and Sadat shared the Nobel Peace Prize
Jimmy Carter didn't get it so if there's
any precedent there that you could read
from that I don't think Donald Trump
stands to be right it would be i guess i
mean kim jeong-hoon yeah jong-un with a
Nobel Peace Prize will trump do a
classic handshake power move like he's
done with others and physically pull Kim
jong-un over to the South Korean side
then all of a sudden North Korean
soldiers will grab Kim Jong Un's ankles
and pull him back into North Korean
territory that would be some great video
so the month of May is going to be crazy
I'm glad we have no vacations scheduled
in May other than Memorial Day weekend
and a three week break starting next
week so other than that we'll be here
the entire time no I'm kidding we
actually will be here and covering the
summit and everything else that comes
from it
okay let's talk a little bit about the
latest from Robert Muller and Donald
Trump we've talked about the back story
of Robert Moeller's team wanting to meet
with Donald Trump there was resistance
from Donald Trump's lawyer you had
lawyers I think is better said a variety
of lawyers each with a
slightly different opinion on this
hypothetical meeting publicly Trump said
that he would want to do it and he would
try to do it if the circumstances are
appropriate there was a sort of debate
around well would Muller be willing to
submit written questions to Trump or if
it's going to be in person maybe the
possibility of limiting the duration of
the meeting or at least limiting the
scope to only certain topics and what
was clear all along is that this was
going to be risky for Trump no matter
what restrictions were placed if there
was an in-person meeting right for for
Donald Trump to be interviewed by robert
muller or more likely investigators
working with robert muller
could be very very dangerous trump
possibly coming in with the idea that he
can just outsmart molar or molars
investigators usually investigators are
smarter than that often asking questions
that they already know the answers to to
see if there's any inconsistencies or
maybe apparent attempts to try to be
deceptive so we got this list of
questions now that robert muller would
want to ask Donald Trump and I want to
think about a couple things as we look
through the list and the New York Times
obtained this list we don't know if it's
a complete list but we know that there's
nearly 50 questions on this list we also
don't know exactly what the source was
in the sense of were these literally the
questions as stated by Trump's
investigators to Trump's lawyers or were
these notes taken by someone at the
White House up to and including Donald
Trump about the sort of general gist of
the questions and we'll get to that
Donald Trump immediately upon the
release of these questions by the New
York Times tweeting that he is not happy
with it he tweeted so disgraceful that
the questions concerning the Russian
witch-hunt
all capitalized letters because I guess
that now is considered a proper noun
were leaked to the media no questions on
collusion oh I see you have a made-up
phony crime collusion that never existed
and an investigation begun with
illegally leaked classified information
nice now even if you can't parse the
grammar there I think we can all sort of
generally understand that Trump's not
happy about the fact that these
questions are public or at least
claiming not to be happy so let's talk
out that leaking of the questions Trump
says he's mad about it New York Times
says they got the questions from someone
outside of Donald Trump's legal team but
they haven't said more about it what
appears to have happened is that
Muller's team passed along a list of
questions to Trump's team more than
likely at the request of Trump's lawyers
saying hey we want to see some of these
questions in advance
someone at the White House leaked them
now if Trump is mad at anybody he should
be mad at his own people right because
the New York Times didn't steal these
questions but it's also possible that
the leak was orchestrated by the Trump
team not as a actual leak but a planned
leak to try to deal Aegina my's the
questions ahead of time and I actually
want to go even further there's the case
to be made that maybe Trump did the
leaking himself Michael Zeldin is a CNN
legal analyst who used to work for
Robert Muller and he says that the way
the questions are written including very
very poor grammar suggests that it would
maybe have been Trump himself who took
these notes and leaked the questions I
don't have a hard time believing that in
principle I just have a hard time
imagining Trump actually taking notes
during a meeting like we know he doesn't
read anything and my guess is he also
writes very very little and I just don't
see Trump being the guy taking the notes
during the meeting will we ever know who
leaked these maybe not let's get to the
questions the questions are wide-ranging
some of them are very very specific at
the same time question what did you know
about phone calls that Michael Flynn
made with Russian ambassador Sergey kis
lyac in December of 2016
publicly we've been told Trump didn't
know about that so that would be a very
interesting question for Robert Muller
to ask Trump how was the decision made
to fire Michael Flynn On February 13
2017 relates to obstruction after the
resignations what efforts were made to
reach out to Michael Flynn about seeking
immunity or possible pardon also relates
to possible obstruction of justice what
was the purpose of your February 14th
2017 meeting with James Comey and what
was said that's an example of a question
that is open-ended but specific right
you're not asking a yes-or-no question
you're saying what was the purpose and
what was discussed and leaving it to
Donald Trump to sort of fill in the
blanks as he sees fit but you're being
very specific about which meeting you're
talking about you're not talking about
the earlier meeting with Comey you're
not talking about the phone call with
Comey you're talking about the February
14th Valentine's Day 2017 meeting with
James Comey another example question
regarding the decision to fire mr. Comey
when was it made why and who played a
role very important question in this
entire thing what did you mean when you
told Russian diplomats on May 10th 2017
but firing mr. Comey had taken the
pressure off that's the type of question
that if Trump's lawyers don't control
Trump or they get an agreement to answer
it in writing
that can lead to one of trumps word
salads that could be very very damaging
by what it sort of inadvertently exposes
so this is why it's such a risk to put
Trump in the same room what was the
purpose of your May 12th 2017 tweet this
was the tweet where Donald Trump said
James Comey better hope that there are
no tapes of our conversations very
interesting topic in this as well when
did you become aware of the Trump Tower
meeting that is a major major story
particularly now that we've heard from
the Russian lawyer Natalia vessel at
skaia we discussed yesterday that she
was actually working as a Russian
informant when is it that Donald Trump
learned about that and then also they
get to what did Trump know about the
communication between Roger stone his
associates Julian Assange or WikiLeaks
an increasingly interesting topic as
well which I asked Roger stone about by
the way when when we interviewed him on
the program I won't read the full list
we're linking to it on YouTube but the
big picture the most important elements
are as I said open-ended questions but
focused on specific conversations and
events and knowledge the other element
that I think is very interesting here is
that the questions we've seen have a
very wide set of paths right they relate
to Trump conversations with specific
Russians they include Oleg arcs that
we've discussed
they include Trump's thoughts on recusal
and possible firings and hacking in
WikiLeaks and everything in between
what would be
really great is if in a fit tomorrow
morning Trump decides to call up Fox and
Friends and starts answering some of
these questions looking to sort of slam
Moeller
but maybe boneheaded leave revealing
even more interesting answers because
that's actually been the theme of this
entire Trump Russia thing which is
self-inflicted damage had Trump never
tweeted and talked about what did or
didn't go on with Russia we would not
have anything close to the investigation
that we currently have and the the final
question that I have is is this gonna
happen right will Muller or an associate
question Trump in person there are
reports that there might be or could be
a subpoena submitted there are also
reports simultaneously that Muller might
decide to move forward without talking
to Trump altogether we don't yet know
but hopefully we will soon I'm on

slash david pakman show okay I wasn't
going to talk about michelle wolf and
the White House Correspondents Dinner
since we normally don't really say much
about it but the scandal around it has
made me want to have a conversation
about it and what was notable this this
year about the White House
Correspondents Dinner was that Trump
didn't attend normally the president
goes they get roasted to some degree and
they generally take it pretty well
Michelle wolf headlined the event in
Trump's absence she made jokes some were
aggressive some were less aggressive
some were very funny some were not as
funny but she's getting absolutely
crushed by conservative media and even
some on the not right like not left
wingers per se but even just sort of
some general media criticism is saying
that maybe Michelle wolf went too far
and the normal MO with these things is
the people being made fun of it's
usually the president people in the
current administration sometimes media
as well they sort of all take it in
stride right cuz it doesn't look good
when you don't and then the partisan al
analysts from the administration's party
will slam the comedian is going too far
or being too aggressive or being
insensitive or distasteful when it was
Obama you'd hear a little bit of that
from the left but mostly it was
understood that this is comedy
right it's comedy and it's comedy period
the right has absolutely lost its mind
over Michelle Wolf's jokes saying
everything from it was bullying that was
Mike Huckabee who said that - it was
cruel unfair disgusting inaccurate and
this is so funny
on so many levels first and foremost
being the same free speech warriors who
were supposedly against the trigger
warnings and the safe spaces are
effectively totally triggered by
Michelle wolf and arguing that she just
went too far and they wanted in practice
the White House Correspondents Dinner to
be a safer space for them than it was I
mean just a glaring hypocrisy but I
thought we should actually look at what
Michelle Wolf said because what really
seems to be getting to them is that
everything Michelle Michelle Wolf said
other than like the clearly sarcastic or
joking comments was true right she
opened with a joke about a porn star
having sex with Trump that happened or
at least there's every indication that
it happened she said Congress
accomplishes very little that's true
most people in the United States degree
she said that at age 32 she's 20 years
older than the age that would make Roy
Moore find her attractive more hasn't
denied to pursuing girls not that much
older than 12 right it's an edgy joke
but it's a fine joke to be making she
referred to Michael Cohen writing a
hundred and thirty thousand dollar check
to someone he did that what's the big
deal she joked about the liberal media
being turned on by the Trump Russia
collusion story that's a critique of
liberal media why would conservatives be
mad about that
she said Hillary wasn't in contact with
Michigan that's a critique of Hillary
Clinton's campaign she joked about Trump
phoning into Fox & Friends
he does phone into Fox & Friends all the
time why is that a big deal she joked
about maybe Trump isn't as rich as he
says he is well we know that that's
something that bothers Trump it's not
original material others have suggested
that she said Trump is a racist I mean
yeah that's a matter of debate but it's
not really unique or controversial at
this point to say that Trump has racist
tendencies she suggested that a Trump
impeachment might be bad because it
would
I'm joined today by Matan field who is
architect and co-founder of dow stack
we've been talking about the dow more
generally we've also talked about dow
stack specifically before so it's great
to have Matan here for people who don't
know Matan because this I find that one
of the most complex things about talking
about these projects is actually
explaining them in a way that the
average person sort of understands what
it is that you are doing let's maybe
start with the Dow what do we mean when
we say the Dow and that's Dao right not
do W is in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average of the United States
what is the Dow for people who don't
know high living thanks thanks for
having me here so thou is the acronym
for decentralized autonomous
organization it's a it's a sort of a new
form of organizing people into Co action
to greater larger large-scale action
justice organization or companies do the
difference though is that while
companies are usually closed structures
closed a hierarchical structures with a
management a vertical management
structure decentralized organization is
accordingly
in direct coordination of people that
are coordinated by code by rules that
are set on the blockchain and that are
inherently open that anyone could
participate in those organizations and
so these are generally the central
service organizations and and and
generally the belief is that the central
stern organization can be can grow into
much much larger scale than companies or
corporations they do this is super
interesting because you know if you
start reading about even going back to
the modernization of humans right Homo
sapiens one of the big distinguishing
factors between humans and nonhumans is
the ability to work together in large
numbers but in sort of flexible ways
right so like bees can work together in
very very large numbers but only in very
narrow senses there are other animal
species that can work together more
flexibly solving some basic problems
but in very small numbers so humans are
unique in that we are able to work
together in very large numbers and also
flexibly however usually usually not
always that does require a hierarchical
structure a centralized structure of
command of sorts and that's often how
you know everything from militaries to
companies are organized if I understand
correctly one of the interesting
elements of what Dow is doing and
ultimately we'll talk about what Dow Dow
stack is also doing is the idea to
enable humans to work together in large
numbers and flexibly but in a
decentralized way that's a nothing but
perfect distinction so these two access
that you mentioned the size of the
coordination and the flexibility of the
Carnation is exactly you know the map of
the world of the history and and we have
never approved we have never been able
to approach the deep upper-right hands
of that map so the largest scale and
most flexibly so the internet for
example is a coordination of the largest
amount number of people on the planet a
global scale but it's coordination
around very specific topic just
distribution of information and indeed
in order to kind of like stretch it to
large scale and flexibly you know we
needed more and more rigid structures
such as Army for example army is the
largest scale with pretty flexibly but
the cost of that is that the
effectiveness the efficiency of large
very very rigid structures is getting
lower lower as they grow up and the
decentralized nature of the organization
what it promises is the ability to probe
the ability the ability to coordinate
people into the largest scale to the
global scale and yet remain most
flexibly and effective at the same time
so it's it's if you want it's a new kind
of Internet but that can do can
coordinate people for about and just
about anything so let's now talk about
Dow stack what is it that your project
is looking to do building on this
concept of Dow
the most basic level doll stock is the
technology to enable dowse to
self-organize to enable dowse to exist
so if i said that instead of
hierarchical rigid structures there are
rules around which people play or
coordinate and those rules are encoded
on the blockchain then dow stock is you
know in the in the most simplistic
manner is the engine for those rules in
a much more detail we can go we can get
into it if you wish but in much more
details it's many elements that compose
those rules and improve them over time
by the end of the days is the engine of
the rules for large-scale coordination
the centralized coordination of the
blockchain well I want to talk more
about the specifics I think for most of
our audience the bigger picture idea is
what what will be more interesting than
so much the underlying technology which
of course some of our audience can can
read about directly in the white paper
so I mean to get us deeper into the
discussion there's a lot here you talked
about decentralization when we talk
about decentralization oftentimes that's
heard potentially as a sort of
individual collectivism which sounds
sort of like an oxymoron but in a way it
does sort of apply here
can you talk maybe a little bit about
the specific applications or maybe some
use cases that most people could relate
to where doubt stack would be used sure
so let me give you three examples three
canonical examples so one example would
be you know the the usual idea of
collaboration so just as companies you
know they coordinate maybe hundred maybe
tens or hundreds or even thousands of
people to build something together so
you build product to produce something
in the same way the centralization can
be the coordination of hundreds of
thousands of let's say for example
creators or developers or designers that
all together build huge applications
that they can solve it totally a totally
new kind of questions that are not now
unsolvable because they can coordinate
many more producers around those
problems so producing for example
producing of code that's one sort of
application which
already very there is a high demand for
that so that already there are large
scale collaborations around mostly
around blockchain projects which are
open sourcing in nature and they have
serious problems which are yet to be
resolved and in order to such as for
example the scalability of blockchain
that's one of maybe one of the biggest
problems and in order to resolve them
you need a large lot much larger scale
of coordination of developers so that's
one example
a totally different example is about for
example management of assets so let's
you know you can have hundreds or
millions of millions people coordinating
shared assets together for example I
think that may be one of the interesting
use case will be insurance so instead of
having million people insured by a
company you can have those minos people
insuring each other
in a big decentralized insurance network
which would be way way more effective
and with higher alignment of interests
then today's insurance companies and and
maybe a third example is the round
curation so we are not very often using
that word but it's actually we are we're
all familiar with that idea so for
example Google itself is they in a
curation agent engine for website so it
tells you what is a good or less good
website or less more more or less
relevant TripAdvisor is a curation for
for travels and hotels and booking.com
and Yelp is a curation engine for
restaurants and so on so forth and we
already are in the phase in history
where we are using crowd creation where
people curate because there's a lot of
information that is carried by people
but isn't but there's no effective way
to enable that at large scale so imagine
millions of people coordinated with
those decentralized curation networks
and by that exchange information about
quality of basically anything you can
think of much more effectively than
today's applications I'd like I'd love
to get your thoughts on another area
where Dow could be applied which is
financial markets right I've talked to a
lot of people about possibilities
between Dow and financial markets and in
general and financial market
particularly in the United States
there's a sort of distrust of the
difference in information that different
players have an assumed manipulation
that's taking place and the top-down
hierarchy is concerning to a lot of
people so on the one hand I've read
position papers from individuals who say
listen automating and but using
algorithms through Dow projects to
control financial markets in a different
way than we're doing it now is very very
exciting the counter that I've heard to
that and I'm curious as to your thoughts
on this Matan is that once you take
something like a financial market and
you allow algorithms to make decisions
that that carries with it a crazy amount
of risk in terms of for the individual
participant in that financial market do
you have a strong opinion one way or the
other on that so let me let me let me
let me first ask first attend something
that you mentioned something else that
you mentioned yeah which is important to
understand the concept so firstly
whenever I say Dow by the way let me let
me also distinct Dow from da you know
I'll get back to that but whenever I say
Dow I mean that there is a certain
collective decision process so let me
give you a counter example so when you
talk about the market a market place it
can be ecommerce market placing the
token exchange market place whenever you
talk about a market place where the base
interaction is peer-to-peer I buy you
sell whenever you have that kind of
structure there is no collective
decision-making it's just in
peer-to-peer interactions so these I
will not call them dowse and call them
peer-to-peer marketplaces now of course
peer-to-peer magnifies can also be those
for example they can collectively decide
about the rules of the game if they want
you know the peer-to-peer game if they
want to it actually have true actually
examples of this sort that we're good
that are going live in the in there in
the next few months but when I when I
purely think about now I think about
collecting the scene making so if you so
if I will apply
now into financial market I will think
about it more as the kind of the
dissenters insurance that I mentioned or
maybe at the central investment fund so
maybe you know 10,000 vistors our
co-managing or traders are co-managing
shared assets and then there is a
dissenter as decision making process
to make so that's that's the that's the
you know one comment and the second
comment regarding algorithms then it's
important to note that I mean the the
the Dow is kind of like hybrid between
the Machine and the dividend they and
the human so there is the machine the
blockchain that kind of like
algorithmically collects the inputs for
many many agents but then there is the
human input into that and it goes in
also in the way that the protocol the
rules that people play around also
include the rules to change the rules so
so in that sense if there is any danger
you know for having not-not-not
optimizer or maybe dangerous rules then
there is also encoded in the rules the
rules to change the rules so that would
be like know the simplest answer to this
concern
Matan in the limited time we have left
I'd love to talk a little bit about the
coin what is the purpose of the coin
what does it do and sort of where are
you in the token sale right so so I
haven't you know I told you what the Dow
is but I haven't when you you know we
can ask like why don't we have them
already so the answer is that there is a
really hard problem of making it down
and the problem is that when you speak
about collective decision-making you
kind of like say consensus like everyone
agree about something yeah right but at
the same time you want to have a you
know effective organization so maybe you
have million people coordinate you know
collaborating and you know maybe they do
million actions a day but you don't
really want million people to look at
each and every action right it's
complete completely not scalable
completely not ineffective so this is a
conundrum of Sandra's governance how do
you build the governance protocol rules
with which 1 million people can on one
hand have consensus about
each and everything but the same time
not really have a consensus and this is
like a tension and the way that we solve
that is introducing a new kind of
consensus protocol we call them
holographic consensus we won't get into
that probably in this in this short
interview yes but that involves certain
machinery certain prediction game in
which people can place predictions
economical predictions about a spate of
proposals fate of decisions inside
organizations and this prediction game
on one hand is super critical for the
enabling of large-scale collective
decision-making at the same time that
that prediction game is being run with
our token with the gent oaken so the
gent talkin if you want is the is the
engine token for if you want gathering
the collective attention and basically
it's it's managed via this prediction
game that is enabling large-scale a
consensus to take place so this is the
the token utility it's it's a critical
element in large-scale governance in
terms of our our crowd say we make we're
basically ran a private sale for a few
months now we've finished that private
sale we have we are now running
literally now running a community
presale it's not it still has like maybe
36 hours to go but it's already the cap
is already reached and next week we'll
have the third phase of a public sale
but basically out of 30 million dollars
that we wanted to raise we've already
raised somewhere around 27 where is the
best place for people to learn not only
about Dow stack the project but also the
ICO so the website I think is the best
well two places the website and the
telegram group but then the terror group
is also linked from the website and vice
versa excellent and we are linking to
both in the description to the YouTube
video Matan field architect and
co-founder of dow stack thanks so much
for talking to me about this today thank
you David thanks a lot
[Music]
the david pakman show at david
pakman.com we are back it felt like a
longer than usual break I think for me
part of it was that almost the entire
week before the break I was broadcasting
remotely so my presence was basically
missing from the studio for thirteen
days which is I don't know it was a
while it felt like a long time for me
too but I think that was just because it
was so eventful when you do a lot of
stuff and you're flying and different
visiting different cities that you've
never been to before the time feels like
it's slowing down a bit well that's good
cuz usually it's like before you know it
it's December and the year is over so
Pat had a great trip he went to London
Paris and Brussels you if I recall
correctly had never been to London or
I'm sorry you had been to London you had
never been to Paris and Brussels what
was the how would you summarize the trip
big picture European okay it was
probably the best vacation I've ever
gone on I loved every second of it I
loved visiting Europe as you mentioned I
had been to London so it's kind of like
comparing apples and oranges when I
compare London to Paris and Brussels in
the sense that apples and oranges are
both fruits and all of those are
different cities in Europe yeah but I
think Paris was was certainly my
favorite city that I went to on this
visit I would say it's my favorite city
in Europe Wow I love just the age of
everything I think just even being out
on the street everything just looks so
beautiful and mold and you can tell with
the architecture there's so much
attention to detail right I loved every
minute of it it was a great vacation
what do you think is so special about
Paris other than the architecture
because it has a genus a quoi
oh sure that is hard to describe to
others and some in some sense but well
how would you characterize it oh man
it's just like I think I think you can
you say this about many European cities
but I love just being in an atmosphere
where you feel as if this is a place
that has been around for such a long
time and so much has happened here like
you can go to the conquered palace
and that's like the site of the French
Revolution and so many executions were
taking place there now you can go there
and like buy an ice cream and go on the
ferris wheel right and you just you feel
the history and it's like it's all there
with you and I loved every second of
that I don't know I mean I just when you
go and you see something that's built in
like the Year 1100 or 1200 right it's
just it feels so amazing because we have
nothing to compare that to yeah it makes
a New England house from 1890 just not
seem that interesting when you go and
you see that the really old stuff is
from the 1112 hundreds and then you've
got less old stuff from the 1600 and
1700s
now the question everybody wants to know
is did you stick to your vegan diet the
entire time and how much Soylent did you
have ahead a different meal replacer
than soil and it's called joylent okay
which is like a powder thing so I drink
one shake of that every day and that's a
good 700 calories to start me off okay
the England I did fight do you know why
because I speak the language fluently
right not as well as the Brits do but I
was able to communicate either I didn't
even have to say I Egan I could just you
know make sure that I'm getting like the
beans from the hash browns and things
are gonna be okay with me right France
it was not as easy
veganism is not prominent there no and
also I don't speak the language I can
say two sentences in French one is I
don't speak French and the other is I'm
not a pineapple okay it's a story for a
different day so like I you know I'm
like looking at the menu I'm trying to
use like the cognate sino from English
and Spanish to determine what these
words mean right uh but it was a
guessing game so yes I did eat a little
bit of cheese you did I did eat probably
some dairy and some butter and stuff it
was not intentional it was not
intentional what was gonna say oh so you
didn't intentionally have no but I'm
dealing with wait staff that doesn't
necessarily speak English I'm pointing
at the menu again once I order something
it's like the damage has been done
okay you know if there's like a little
cheat I'll like set aside the things on
the plate and my girlfriend could eat it
no let me talk let me talk I think the
best I can
okay when what is the item that you
think like almost definitely you ate not
vegan well there was like there was some
cheese and a salad so cheese you're
aware of as definitely not vegan that
was yeah that was nicer
like I could like pick it apart you know
okay I'm sure I'm sure they cooked with
some butter okay cuz I could like kind
of taste that and I had to just kind of
like you know hold my nose and get
through it
Wow no I'm not a perfect person I'm not
a perfect vegan but I mean once I've
ordered the thing and has come to my
table what options do I have
yeah get another meal I mean wait what
good is that gonna do right what's gonna
suck it up Wow
did you drink Parisian espresso yes you
did although my girlfriend wanted to
drag me to like Starbucks or over God
because that's what she knows right and
she wants to get like a pure rush of
caffeine not just like the simple
espresso shot or cappuccino and I had to
push her like no we're at a different
land here we got to live like the
Parisians
and we can't do the Starbucks thing I'm
just not gonna have it that is
disturbing quite frankly that is very
very disturbing yeah what was the most
notable thing that happened big picture
okay um well you know I obviously saw
like the big sights right I don't have
to get into like going down Big Ben and
you know going to the top of the Eiffel
Tower and all that stuff because that's
that's pretty simple crossing Abbey Road
to get the picture very touristy thing
to do
yeah but it's also a whole bunch of fun
because first of all there's like a
dozen other people trying to do the same
thing so everyone's kind of waiting
their turn but also you have to wait for
the right opportunity because it'd be
perfect yeah because it's an active road
yeah and cars are passing by non-stop
and I think most a majority of the the
people driving understand that these are
tourists trying to get their their nice
picture yeah and and they're respectful
of it and they'll wait and you know kind
of deal with it but then you get like
this twenty percent of people who are
just on their horns and very pissed off
that the tourists are doing this but we
got the picture right I mean it took a
few times but yeah it was just like a
fun experience I don't know if you when
you went to London do you do the same
thing it's a very touristy thing to do I
didn't do that no no I didn't okay yeah
I'm somehow not surprised alright what
else did you okay John alright Oh a
pickpocketing story from France
I knew ahead of going there that there's
a bunch of pickpocketing in France you
gotta be wary of it you got to watch
your pockets and I made sure to put my
wallet in my backpack for the entire
trip hmm what were you clothes over
there act behind you yep okay that
doesn't seem so smart
as compared to putting in your pockets
the hot pocket front but yes no really
well yeah I think hiding it at the
bottom of the backpack below like
sweatshirts oh I should ends ippon it up
is safer than just having it in your
pocket so all I did was I keep my cell
phones in my pockets and I went you know
through the first two three days in
Paris not experiencing anything that was
concerning I didn't think I would get
pickpocketed and maybe just people are
blowing this out of proportion right
right so I felt you know a little bit
safe but I'm still keeping the wall in
the backpack I'm at the the arc what's
the famous Arc de Triomphe
ugly troll and I'm going to from there
to the Eiffel Tower so imagine it's a
very touristy area although it's
probably part of a line that extends
into the suburbs and whatnot I step on
the subway I kid you not like a second
after I get on the subway a guy holding
on to the pole drops an inhaler and a
few other things like some pens just to
create some chaos right and also the
inhaler kind of gives you this image of
like oh this this poor guy can't breathe
very well you got to be concerned about
him
so he like he reaches down to grab the
inhaler and screeching a bunch of other
stuff he's like a foot away from me the
guy grabs onto my leg
literally just holds on to my leg and he
starts exclaiming my ticket my ticket is
in your shoe so once this happens like I
know because there are pickpocketers
here I put my hands right in my pockets
where I'm you know my cell phone is to
protect it yeah a little bit and he just
like he keeps holding on and you know
like the first two or three seconds
obviously I was very confused and I saw
the inhaler so I was like alright I
can't be incredibly mean to the guy
getting the benefit of the doubt but it
just went on too long but he said my
ticket in English yeah huh who's he
probably knew was a touristy area and
the guy knew what he was doing right
right
I think what he was trying to do was
either like hold on to my leg for long
enough that a friend of his some like
cohort could reach behind and in the
chaos reach into my pocket and leave it
before it left but luckily you know
being a city person I wasn't going to be
fooled by it and so I kept my hands in
my pockets for like the first two or
three seconds and then once he wasn't
letting go of my leg I like kicked him I
really like I had the fear the first
kick rushed him off of me and then like
it wasn't like I guess strike it was
like a push kick right and then like
he's like he's because he was on the
ground from the get-go it's like it was
a hard thing to do like on the ground
right and then ii was like a strike like
i kicked him off the train when the
doors closed and you're like yeah it was
so close a bunch of chaos no people
didn't clap i've been like I still had
to like check do I have everything like
wow I still like check my pockets I like
looked in the backpack like and I was
pretty startled by it that it was
disturbing yeah and you don't have to
after you have like a traumatic
experience or something where you just
think that you didn't perform as well as
you could have you like play it back a
bunch of times yeah yeah I could have
done this differently or should I I was
still getting that even though
everything went just fine
like I still had all my stuff I was
saved my girlfriend was safe like things
could not have gone better really and
I'm sure the guy wasn't hurt like I mean
it was it wasn't the strongest weaker
anywhere would you say the kik connected
I liked his chest check yeah Wow and
like it was like it pushed him back like
wow I was it was pretty heroic I gotta
say please send me the memes related to
this story I beg you yeah the the Arc de
Triomphe is were actually where my
girlfriend and I were almost sort of
pseudo scammed or a guy came up and he
said excuse me you dropped the ring and
he appears to pick up a ring off of the
ground and both of us say no that's
that's not a ring and he says oh well
it's a gift for you and he puts it on my
girlfriend's hand and she says uh okay
and he's like do you you know one two
euro and she just takes it off and hands
it back to it okay
no and I'm sure he just goes around
doing that yeah like how though that
that's nothing compared to what you
experienced right and I felt like I
wasn't really prepared for it because I
always just thought that pickpocketers
go in and like reach into your pocket
and you never even knew they were there
right I didn't realize that had all
these different plans and different
avenues to pursue yes that's so like I
was startled by it for a little bit it
took a little while before I felt
comfortable again that's uh I really
really do fortunately nothing bigger
happened I guess what I would say all
right so I'll talk a little bit about my
trip I was in Vegas of course then I
went to for the conference then I loo to
Los Angeles to visit former TV director
natandy at man rented a car drove north
through basically a number of different
places stopped in a bunch of places
Santa Barbara San Luis Obispo
Monterey ultimately terminating the trip
in San Francisco spending a couple of
days there and then flying home and so
first of all at the conference in Vegas
this was Mike Papantonio conference
there were people from all sides of the
left so to speak the we believe the
Russia story is a hoax side the we
believe there is a Russia story side and
so on and so forth so there were some
very interesting disagreements that took
place at the conference none of which I
participated in because I wasn't there
to debate politics with people but Sam
cedar certainly participated in some of
those debates saw Genk huger there saw a
lot of the Ring of Fire people saw ed
Schultz's producer saw some people from
RT a lot of different people there and I
think my message is the left is very
very divided but all elements of the
left were still able to sort of be
cordial and have dinners together and
that did not evolve it did not devolve
into partisan bickering so maybe more
diverse than divided then it was a
diverse set of views rather than a
divided set sure so that's that and you
know I go to the conference twice a year
not not really anything else to report
from there I had just a horrible
experience at the hotel in Los Angeles
and I'm not even gonna say what hotel it
was doesn't really matter but I was
staying in Los Angeles with my
girlfriend for three nights we checked
in and I was told oh uh checking out
tomorrow right I said no not not
checking out tomorrow I'm here I'm here
three nights mmm no no you have a
one-day reservation one night
reservation but uh doesn't really make
sense here's you know my whatever all my
information oh you know what happened
for some reason your three night
reservation got split into a one night
reservation and a two night reservation
I'm gonna combine them for you so that
everything will be all set no problem
whatsoever
I get into the room and the room stinks
to high heaven of some kind of perfume
they it's one of these hip hotels where
they have like a unique scent that's
sprayed everywhere but particularly in
the rooms
everything on the bedding on the pillows
in the bathroom everywhere and
immediately my skin starts to react to
it like I'm allergic to this scent I
start getting itchy and red all over so
I call down and I say listen I don't
know what it is that smells in here
the room's fine everything's fine but
I'm I think I'm allergic to whatever it
is that your spring and they immediately
said oh that's our signature scent we're
gonna send out our tea but I don't even
want to use all the words they use
because it'll probably make it evident
but anyway they they don't call it
housekeeping they're they call it our
style team I like it we're gonna send
our style team up to neutralize the
scent it's gonna be no problem for you I
went out to dinner went out for with
with my brother and a few other friends
Bubba Bo Bob I get back they did do a
good job of neutralizing the scent but
it's 55 degrees in the room because
they've opened up the windows and it was
a cool night and set the AC to max I
guess to get rid of that scent to like
get it out through the vents and through
the windows or whatever so the rooms
freezing no problem they've neutralized
the scent close the window set the AC to
a normal temperature it looks like
everything's okay okay next day I get up
I go out I come back and it's about 5:00
p.m. and I go to the elevator and you've
got to you know put your your card your
room card up for the elevator to work
and the red light comes on doesn't let
me up the elevator not thing that's
weird maybe the car yesterday became
demagnetized my girlfriend takes out her
card she puts it up to the thing red
light were blocked out from the elevator
now immediately I think back to I had a
one night reservation and a two night
reservation I think what happened is
they didn't fix the problem and I've
been checked out because I had a one
night reservation as far as their
computer was concerned check out is noon
it's 5:00 p.m.
I'm out okay I go to the front desk and
I hand them my card and I say I'm unable
to get into the room into the elevator
they say well checkout time was at noon
mr. Pakman and it's 5:00 p.m. and I say
no I'm here for two more days
buh-buh-buh-buh-buh they eventually get
it fixed I get into the room in the same
room that same rooms good yeah I get
into the room
it stinks again they've resurfaced why
because the note not to spray it on my
reservation was only there for the one
night resumption not for the second
nights and within five minutes clearly
when I actually went into the room
something was flagged security shows up
and they say mr. Pakman we're here about
your departure time yeah you're supposed
to go in hours ago I just dealt with
this for the second time oh my god I'm
here for two more days so anyway you
know not not a great not a great
experience there but beautiful bedding
absolutely beautiful bedding and and my
back felt great from the mattress did
you notice that other people were
complaining about the scent too or do
you think just because you were allergic
to it
that's why you were so averse to the
smell I know that other people were
complaining about it from the reaction
when I called down and I said listen I
don't know if there's like a perfume or
a cleaning product I said oh it's our
signature scent we'll send our team up
there it was a Senate it was very
obvious that it's a common problem so
that was that I had an interesting
experience we're walking through Beverly
Hills I the previous night I had been
talking with my brother and some of his
friends about what shows we're currently
watching and I mentioned the Americans
is back great program I love the
Americans margo martindale is in the
show she's great
Frank Langella is in the program he's
great walking through Beverly Hills
very nice sports car pulls up hmm I look
over and then I do a double take and
it's Frank Langella of the Americans and
of many other great programs and movies
sitting there on speakerphone 80
year-old guy working speaker phone while
driving very very advanced guy for 80
and he probably has a similar story I
was just driving by and David Pakman
said I saw Frank Langella other than
that had a great time in California love
San Francisco San Francisco continues to
be one of my favorite cities in the
country
we're back and the day after Earth Day
2018 and one of the most important
issues that we're dealing with as humans
is what we're doing to the climate and
much of what the current President of
the United States is doing can be rolled
back and in some areas the damage done
can be sort of undone to some degree but
you can't undo years of damaging our
planet the only planet that we at least
for now have to live on and the best
analogy I can think of it sort of like a
huge ocean liner or a large commercial
plane that's sailing or flying in the
wrong direction the amount of time and
fuel and effort to reroute it after
every minute that it's going in the
wrong direction grows and in some cases
grows exponentially if a commercial
airliner is off target for 15 minutes
that could potentially add 30 minutes in
total to the flight time that you would
have had from point A to point B if the
plane had been going in the right
direction from the get-go and that
effect can grow even more over time and
that's sort of an analogy for climate
change right the amount of damage that
Donald Trump and his administration will
do relative to what another president
might have done in a four-year term
could take us way more than four years
to undo and on that note Earth Day was
yesterday April 22nd 2018 and Donald
Trump and his White House put out an
Earth Day statement really in name only
and orwellian is really the only way
that I can describe it and what I'm
referencing is George Orwell's book 1984
that book included the terms doublethink
and Newspeak and those have been sort of
colloquially blended together into the
term doublespeak the idea of ambiguous
speech by definition of by by design in
order to be deceptive or speech that
means the opposite of what it sounds
like and that's sort of what I mean when
I say that Donald Trump's Earth Day
statement was Orwellian in nature
because Earth Day is supposed to be
about
supporting environmental protection
taking care of our planet that's what
it's been about since 1970 when it was
first celebrated this is a global event
nearly 200 countries participating and
Donald Trump's Earth Day statement
celebrated the destruction that is being
done to the environment by his
administration let's take a look at a
piece of that statement that was put out
where the Trump administration said in
the second paragraph quote we also know
that a strong market driven economy is
essential to protecting these resources
meaning natural earth resources for this
reason my administration is dedicated to
removing unnecessary and harmful
regulations that restrain economic
growth and make it more difficult for
local communities to prosper and to
choose the best solutions for their
environment that's the exact opposite of
the reality right market-driven is
what's causing the problem not enough
regulation on industry since
industrialization right for the last
hundred and fifty two hundred years
that's been the catalyst for the
situation we now find ourselves in
Trump's administration has destroyed
countless Obama era environmental
protection regulations doing more damage
to the environment by their removal and
Trump's EPA director Scott Pruett who by
the way we've learned is the subject of
ten federal investigations right now
I'll tell you about that a little bit
later
Trump's EPA director Scott Pruett has
announced that he's going to be gutting
fuel standards that were meant to cut
carbon emissions those will be gone soon
Trump's administration has a plan to do
more offshore drilling which does more
damage to the environment so Trump's
message on Earth Day is we love the
earth protect the earth I guess which
he's going to do by removing regulations
and allowing industry to further destroy
the planet the Earth Day statement from
Trump is the opposite of what Earth Day
is supposed to be about or in other
words
Earth Day
made Trump make a statement that he's
going to do exactly what earth day is
supposed to stop it's like a speech on I
mean I don't know Martin Luther King Day
about how the president is going to work
hard to get us back to like the era of
Jim Crow or something I don't know if
that's a good analogy or a speech on
Holocaust Remembrance Day about how the
president is going to finally get to the
bottom of those crafty Jews controlling
the banking industry maybe these are bad
analogies the guy seems to be saying
that to have a clean environment a safe
environment a healthy planet
corporations must thrive when
corporations are the ones that have by
and large done the economic destruction
when we've left them unchecked but I
guess we have clean coal now or
something if you ask Donald Trump
totally clean beautiful coal and the the
real point I want to make here the
statement is totally Orwellian the
broader absurdity here is that we have
this Earth Day thing once a year which I
support I agree with it's a beautiful
thing 200 countries nearly getting
involved but then we elect politicians
nationwide who deny climate change
altogether or at least deny that climate
change is connected to human activities
they represent this year-round and we
have Earth Day once a year it's
absolutely disgusting
unconscionable and immoral what we are
doing and at the top of the list of
problems related to Earth Day is the guy
running the EPA Scott Pruett which is
what I want to talk to you about next
okay I didn't think we'd be going back
to the supposed P tape a possible video
recording of Donald Trump with
prostitutes in Russia possibly engaging
in or maybe just watching them engage in
various sexualized urine related rituals
I'm really using very very the cleanest
possible language to talk about this but
Trump's been caught in his first live
related to the supposed P tape and I
want to be super clear here so I'm going
to say this twice I'm gonna say this now
and I'm gonna say it after I explain the
lie the reason this is a big deal is not
because it proves that the P tape is
real the P tape may not be real this is
a big deal because
is evidence that Trump is lying about
the facts related to the P tape and
Trump often has a pattern of lying about
small elements of a story first and then
the disproving of those small elements
leads to an understanding that it's all
a big lie okay so that that's the
disclaimer what happened
we've now learned through various
interviews given by the fired FBI
director James Comey that Trump
specifically wanted to convince Comey
when they met that the P tape rumor
wasn't true okay and according to Comey
Trump said a few things in sort of his
defense one is that he's a germaphobe or
something along those lines the other is
that it's not possible that Trump was
involved in the urine stuff with Russian
prostitutes or prostitutes in Russia
because he never spent the night in
Moscow back in 2013 around the time of
the Miss Universe pageant that was held
there this is the trip during which it
supposedly happened if it did Trump
insisted he left on a plane the same day
the same night and that apparently
implied in that is that if you're gonna
do urine fetish prostitute stuff in a
hotel room you'd have to do it in the
middle of the night or very very very
late at night now any normal person
could say you know it could also happen
during the day but let's stick with
Donald Trump's story which is it's not
possible because he didn't stay over
let's look at a piece of James commis
writing about the situation where Comey
said Comey said he said he had spoken to
people who had been on the Miss Universe
trip with him and they had reminded him
that he didn't stay overnight in Russia
for that he said he arrived in the
morning did events then showered and
dressed for the pageant at the hotel he
didn't say the hotel name and left for
the pageant afterwards he returned only
to get his things because they departed
for New York by plane that same night so
Trump's alibi so to speak is he didn't
spend the night he left the same day up
until now there was the suspicion that
that's not true that Trump actually
stayed in Moscow for two nights which
immediately contradicts his supposed
alibi but now Bloomberg is able to
disprove that claim specifically because
they have the flight records and what we
have learned is that Donald Trump flew
to Moscow on November 7th of 2013 not
his plane but on a private jet owned by
Phil Ruffin who's one of trumps business
partners that plane landed in Moscow on
November 8th accounting for the time
changed the time zone difference later
on November 8th Trump went to eat at
Nobu Moscow the sushi restaurant Nobu
Moscow the next day November 9th there
are Facebook posts that show Trump was
at the Ritz Hotel during the day that's
already won overnight and Trump tweeted
that he had a tour of Moscow on that day
and then later Trump went to the Miss
Universe pageant itself then went to an
after party and that after-party started
at 1:00 a.m. November 10th
so remember Trump arrived November 8th
and he's there at least until 1:00 a.m.
November 10th which is almost two full
days later later that night the plane
that Trump flew to Moscow in left at
4:00 a.m. meaning that even if Trump was
on that plane and let's assume that he
was he spent the better part of two full
nights in Moscow so that directly
disproves Trump's story and the timeline
so let's go back to what I started with
because it's the most important thing
here I'm not saying that the fact that
Trump lied about not having spent any
nights in Moscow proves that the P tape
is real or that the prostitute story is
real whether or not there is a video
recording it's a big deal because Trump
is now lying about his supposed alibi
when it comes to the P tape and when I
step back from it I don't know what the
truth is
but it's weird that there's been so much
focus by Trump on the existence or
nonexistence of this p tape and it's
also weird that too many specifics from
Trump about something that supposedly
didn't happen seem to be wrong and it's
also kind of weird I'm thinking like if
someone came to me with this I would
just say there's no tape because it's
not something I did period I wouldn't
say well you know I'm very germaphobic
you know I wouldn't really get involved
would get involved in urine stuff with
Russian prostitutes or you know it the
timing of it like it's basically a
scheduling conflict right like when you
say it couldn't have it didn't happen
because I didn't overnight in Moscow
you're not saying it's something you
wouldn't do you're just saying like the
timing
didn't allow for it which is a really
weird way to defend yourself yeah I feel
like there are two possibilities here
one is that it's like the one aspect of
the Christopher Steele dossier that's
not true and Trump thought that he could
easily debunk it so that's why he wanted
to zero in on that yeah the other
possibility is that pretty much
everything in the Steele dossier is true
but because Trump found this to be like
the most damaging to his reputation most
hellacious the most embarrassing he
wanted to make sure that that was off
the record there's a third possibility
which is maybe he was given wrong
information about overnighting and like
it still didn't happen but the alibi
can't be that he didn't overnight there
or something like that but the bottom
line is these are not exactly normal
reactions in light of these accusations
and you know what in the end Hillary
Clinton reportedly urinated multiple
times during the 2016 presidential
campaign Comey is not talking about it
Fox News isn't - nobody's talking about
the fact that Hillary Clinton was
urinating all throughout that campaign
and we're only hearing about Trump and
urine in the middle of debates no less
she would leave and not be back for the
commercial break though right we in fact
Donald Trump calling attention to it at
one point so lie confirmed about the P
tape stuff it's not actually about the P
tape it's about the fact that Trump has
been caught lying again about something
that a normal person would just say I
didn't do that and there's no evidence
that I did it because it didn't happen
let's talk about a visit to the United
States by French president Emmanuel
macron who went to Washington DC
yesterday first state dinner took place
last night the entire thing was a gong
show from the get-go and I'm gonna get
to Donald Trump's statement about his -
plus our meeting with McCrone
momentarily but just to give you first a
little bit of the flavor for the endless
string of bizarre faux pause each
outdoing the previous in terms of
Trump's meeting with world leaders
during a photo-op in the White House
Donald Trump at one point claimed to be
wiping dandruff off of the shoulder of
the French president and the funniest
thing if you're watching you'll be able
to hear what Trump says whether you're
listening or watching if you're watching
you'll also be able to observe the look
on Emmanuel macron face when Donald
Trump is due
this and it is it's an amazing reaction
by virtue of non reaction McCrone sort
of stone-faced with a smile right like a
an immovable smile on his face as Donald
Trump claims to be wiping dandruff off
of the French president's suit take a
look at this take a listen to this mr.
president they're all saying what a
great relationship we have and they're
actually correct it's not fake news
finally it's not fake news so it's a
great honor great honor that you hear
but we do have a very special
relationship in fact I'll get that
little piece of dandruff little piece we
have to make them perfect he is perfect
so it is really it is really great to be
with you and your special friend thank
you thank you thank you thank you again
thank you very much mr. president
yeah interestingly that was the least
cringe-worthy moment of the entire visit
so it only got worse from there and they
did a sort of statement after their
meeting they were sitting across from
each other at a table Mike Pence was
next to draught Trump and Jim mattis and
a John Bolton was on Trump's side of the
table and everything about it was just
transmitting a very very strange
atmosphere let's go through a few clips
from the meeting we're going to have a
short little meeting and it turned out
to be a long meeting and it could have
gone on for another two hours we
discussed a lot of things a lot of
problems in the world a lot of problems
that we think can be solved we've come a
long way just the two of us I think is
understanding when we talked about Iran
we talked about Syria we talked about a
lot of subjects that really are big big
hard situations and we think we have
solutions to a number of them so we're
going to continue that now and then
Emanuel and myself will meet again I
think after this meeting right aside
from Trump referring to them going over
a number of big hard situations that
that actually again I that's not the
weirdest part of this what's weird I
think is sort of a couple things number
one there's this attitude from Trump
generally that like he's bad
McCrone right on some level he's just
he's a better he's a better man he's a
better person he's more important than
McCrone but also there's this feeling
like it's all sort of a bother to him
like he he's sort of yeah I'm doing this
and we had a meeting we could have met
longer we talked about trade I set the
agenda but it's all kind of like from a
point of condescension isn't that it's
going through the motions he's talking
about law without saying anything and I
kind of wish I could do that too you're
just like well in the air well and what
he ended up doing is just going very
quickly into bragging about random
random things right so there's no real
indication that he actually saw the
content of the meeting with the French
president is that important because he
immediately jumped in to bragging about
unemployment rates in different states
take a look very good numbers are coming
out on our businesses you see the
numbers that are getting released on our
companies and our businesses they're
very strong the economy is is been
really incredible unemployment now is at
the lowest point ever in history in many
many states the states were enumerated
last night late last night the numbers
came out and we've hit the lowest
unemployment numbers in many decades in
some cases and in some cases the lowest
number is period it was just reiterated
that unemployment for African American
families it's been the best in history
for Hispanic families the best in
history for women the best in eighteen
years and that's very close to going
much higher than that so it's really
something very special so we're very
happy about that it's like what is he
talking about if you're a manual McCrone
and you're sitting there across from him
what what do you make of the fact that
Trump is just making absolutely no sense
and a lot of the stuff he said wasn't
even true he said we've just gotten the
net we've gotten the numbers from our
companies and everything's great the Dow
crashed 500 points yesterday
unanticipated bad earnings numbers like
where is Trump getting this stuff and it
just went on like this for a while I
don't know what is going through the
French president's head as this is going
on and then Trump talks about his
conversation with McCrone again this
time saying they talked about trade
which I'm sure they did but it's made
abundantly clear that Trump doesn't know
anything about Trey
look at this the president and I working
on trade the trade with France is
complicated because we have the European
Union I would rather deal just with
France the Union is very tough for us
that they have trade barriers that are
unacceptable our farmers can't send
their product into the European Union
easily as they should and we accept
their product so we have to make a
change and they understand that if we're
negotiating Wilbur and Steve and
everybody we're negotiating with the
European Union yeah but he's doing a
great job and then trade apparently got
Trump into talking about China where it
really got strange take a look at this
last clip is we have no choice but to be
very serious
you know we've put on very substantial
tariffs and that will continue unless we
make a trade deal I think we're we've
got a very good chance of making a deal
as you know they've just stated
President Xi a terrific guy and a friend
of mine but he's representing China and
I'm representing the United States
president she made a speech four days
ago where he said that China is going to
be opened up it's not opened up right
now they trade with us we can't trade
with them they did 504 billion dollars
last year and we did a hundred and
twenty billion dollars that's a
tremendous imbalance that we can't have
that yeah the key moment there was when
Trump clarified that he represents the
United States and trade deals it's

the david pakman show at david
pakman.com welcome to the bonus show the
alleged gunman in the Marjory Stoneman
Douglas High School in Florida
reportedly wants to give any inheritance
that he is due from his late mother's
estate to the victims families or an
organization that will help the
community heal according to his
attorneys yesterday he appeared at a
Broward County Circuit Court in Fort
Lauderdale to determine whether he's
indigent or whether he stands to collect
$800,000 from his late mother's estate
and other financial accounts in his name
which would mean that he is not indigent
and this is sort of a determination in
terms of a legal representation that
he's going to get and it determines a
couple elements of how the case against
him is going to proceed before it was
determined that he couldn't afford his
own attorney and he was appointed a
public defender and now they're trying
to figure out well if he has this money
coming to him then the public defender
should actually be dismissed and he
should be forced to hire an actual
private attorney and pay that attorney
and what is being said by his current
court-appointed attorney is that the
alleged shooter doesn't want the money
he wants the money to go to the victims
families and then presumably he would be
indigent because he wouldn't be getting
the money and he would get to keep his
court-appointed attorney this is kind of
interesting to me Pat because I mean I
want to be clear public defenders are
doing something that is very very
important but they are not always the
best attorneys in terms of the resources
and training that they can provide to
clients so it's generally considered and
part of it is just being overworked and
having an insane number of cases they're
working on at one time it's generally
considered that having a private
attorney if you can afford one is going
to afford you a better defense than
having a public defender but it seems
that he's sort of manipulating the
situation
to try to keep the public defender and
again somebody who's willing to commit
allegedly commit an act like this may
not be someone who's going to think most
rationally about anything but it is an
unusual situation right I do wonder why
he would choose a public defender over a
private the defender if he can afford
one especially because it seems like the
private defender would be able to offer
more time to the shooter and the guys up
against the death penalty so you'd have
to imagine he wants to keep his life to
serve the rest of his sentence until he
dies at an old age but you never really
know I guess and I think that it is an
interesting choice I wonder if it's the
sign of remorse that he's showing by
offering the money to the victims
instead of keeping it for himself
obviously if he's going to live the rest
of his life in prison it's not like he
can really use that money to a great
extent so I think I think it's an
interesting story at least there's a
couple different elements that you could
point to right one is is the idea of the
donation something that he came up with
or something his public defender came up
with is the idea of the donation
potentially to curry favor to avoid the
death penalty and maybe get life in
prison is there someone else who has
influenced him when it comes to this
possibility of the donation and then the
at the end of it it's once again if we
imagine what it takes for someone to
commit such a heinous act
can we really apply sort of what our
logic would be to what they are doing I
don't really know that we can right and
Nicholas Cruz the shooter did seem to be
a little bit remorseful the day of the
shooting even if you just watched like
his arraignment and you know thinking
look at the footage he did seem a little
bit sad about it which is interesting
because obviously the decision to go on
a shooting spree at a school wasn't a
spur-of-the-moment decision I'm sure he
planned it for a long time and after the
shooting many of the students at
Parkland said that they suspected it was
Cruz because he just exhibited signs of
that for many years but I guess you know
after committing the shooting maybe he
did have a change of heart
because then you're actually seeing the
ramifications of your actions so I think
he could have you know had a change
obviously he has to pay a penalty for it
and I think that that penalty should be
serving the rest of his life in prison
that's probably going to be the result
regardless of if he has a public
defender or private defender but maybe
he will get that death penalty it is
Florida after all what you're saying
about maybe regretting what he is
accused of doing right after the
shooting is interesting we know that
with a lot of these premeditated actions
that often connect to sort of emotional
disturbance including suicide attempts
that it's very common for example with
suicide attempts I recently read an
interesting article about this that very
often for bridge jumpers who survive
many of them say the instant that I let
go I realized I wanted to live and of
course not all of them do some of them
do and then it turns their life around
and they become you know suicide
prevention activists or whatever the
case may be it's probably similar not
that mass shootings and suicide are in
any way analogous but I would not be at
all surprised if the moment that a
shooter starts doing a shooting they
changed their mind and I all or realized
that it was a mistake and I also
wouldn't be surprised if they end up
taking their own lives because of that
realization we talk about these
murder-suicide things where it sort of
presumed that the shooter goes in
planning to also take their own life
maybe they don't always but it's that
regret that hits the second day open
fire where they say I can no longer live
with myself and that's why they take
their own life and their own lives in
the shooting yeah it probably depends on
the shooter but another angle I want to
touch on too is do you feel comfortable
talking about this story even because I
remember after the Parkland shooting we
deliberately chose not to say the name
of the shooter because you know there's
this idea that shooters could be
inspired by the attention that they get
sometimes posthumously even by the media
after they go on these sprees and kill a
lot of people but I mean there are so
few mass shooters out there and I think
we have to get a sense of what is going
on inside their heads and so the only
really way to do that is by
looking into the specific shooters so I
mean it's like you're solving one
problem we're trying to solve one
problem but perhaps you're creating
another and causing more mass shootings
indirectly I don't know yeah I don't
know I don't know either but we'll see
ultimately what happens with the
attorney we'll see what happens with
these supposed planned donations I've
been talking for a while about how
studies on diet and exercise show that
just mathematically speaking diet is
much more responsible for weight loss
than is exercise and what I mean
mathematically is that you can much more
easily reduce net calories by reducing
the calories that you eat then you can
work off calories by exercising and sort
of if you imagine how long do you have
to exercise to burn 200 calories versus
how easily can you avoid eating 200
calories worth of food right so we've
known that for a while but there's an
interesting new study published in
diabetes magazine or the journal
diabetes which involved animals but it
appears as though it could also be
applied to exercise in humans and what
the study looked at is exercise and
weight loss among people and animals and
what it found was that exercise in and
of itself is not an effective way to
lose weight but it doesn't mean what I
said in terms of the balance between
diet and exercise what it points out is
that in most experiments that were done
participants lost less weight than would
have been expected mathematically given
the number of calories they were burning
in their workouts so it's sort of hard
to separate this from what I said before
about you can much more easily avoid
eating 200 calories than you can burn
200 calories what the study found is
even when burning 200 calories by
exercising the amount of weight that we
would anticipate would be lost by
burning the 200 calories seems to be
smaller than the amount of weight not
gained or lost by avoiding the
consumption of too
calories I really don't know Pat whether
I'm doing a good job of explaining this
but I think the idea is that diet is an
incredibly important part of weight loss
and that exercise is important for
fitness but that is a weight loss tool
it is not as important as some people
make it out to be yeah and I think the
thing is after you exercise you often
get hungry too so say you burn off 200
calories you're gonna be starving
afterwards and so you'll probably eat
something that could surpass 200
calories and then you know you didn't
really lose any weight after that and
the other reason too is I mean if you it
let's say you go on like a two-mile run
or something like that you may get sore
you're probably gonna be sedentary
afterwards so you may decide to just
chill out for the rest of the day and
watch television instead of like going
for a walk or doing things that would
also burn calories just at a slower rate
so I think that in part has to do with
why exercise isn't as efficient
obviously you know there are there are
some benefits when it comes to weight
loss and exercise like I think it does
speed up your metabolism but if you're
just going for pure weight loss alone
the most effective and the easiest thing
really is just to eat less and you know
that can be hard for some people
certainly yeah so I mean I guess that
would be other than going out and
exercising I I don't know if everybody
would agree that the easy thing to do is
to just eat less I mean I think a lot of
people definitely struggle with that but
I think that your point about the sort
of relative efficiency of it is one that
has been replicated in study after study
I mean it have you ever seen ever run on
a treadmill and you should go for like a
two-mile run or something and you see
the amount of calories you burned it's
probably something like 200 to 250
calories that can be pretty daunting to
people because 250 calories is like a
bag of potato chips you know it's it's
not that much food so I think someone
who's trying to lose weight could go for
that two-mile run on a treadmill exert
all this energy try so hard to get there
and then they think wow that that's all
I burned 200 calories that's like the
amount of a granola bar or something and
then yeah they could lose interest and
be demoralized and not try as much
anymore well to segue from diet to
cannabis which can sometimes make people
very very hung
I want to talk about former Speaker of
the House John Boehner John Boehner was
Speaker of the House from 2011 to 2015
and he has changed his view on Marable
legalization he said yesterday on
Twitter that where he follows me by the
way that my thinking on cannabis has
evolved he previously said many many
times that he was completely opposed to
the legalization of marijuana and now he
says that he has a different view that
it is time for a shift in federal
marijuana policy he believes that
cannabis needs to be D scheduled meaning
not scheduled as a Schedule one drug so
that research can be done veterans can
be helped we can deal with we have a
number of studies that show that
cannabis legalization is hugely
beneficial when dealing with the opioid
epidemic so this is I mean listen
Boehner was I saw Boehner more of a as a
pragmatist than an ideologue now I don't
mean that he wasn't an ideological right
winger but what I mean is that I always
felt that part of his being an
ideological right winger was political
posturing rather than his personally and
sincerely held beliefs that doesn't make
them any better they are just as
damaging when a politician says they're
anti gay to raise money rather than
because they actually are anti-gay it's
not really any better right so it's not
a defensive John Boehner but what I am
saying Pat is that I'm not that
surprised that now that he's freed from
the depraved constraints of the
political system we have I'm not that
surprised that he's saying something
like this I'm also not surprised because
he's accepting money for working as an
advisor to a marijuana company you know
that always helps a little bit too and
we're changing his mind so he claims was
that he had a friend who had back pain
and the friends started using cannabis
and apparently it helped him a great
deal and that for Boehner was you know
realization for him that oh this can
actually help people and it seems like
with Republicans they always have to see
it firsthand like you know Rob Portman
the senator from Ohio
he wasn't in support of gay marriage
until he found out that it was son was
gay it's like why does it have to impact
you personally for you to come around to
the right position don't you realize
can't use a little bit of empathy to
understand that other people are
experiencing this - absolutely and I
that is when we did the Pat Robertson
clip yesterday where Pat Robertson just
seemed perplexed like only a couple
percent of the population is LGBT why is
everybody making all these changes even
though most people aren't most people
aren't LGBT well some people have
empathy and they understand that we can
do things to help others that don't
necessarily directly benefit us although
I would argue that it benefits us
broadly speaking societally yeah it's I
I wish that I still like it when a
right-winger changes their mind on a
social position right because they
change to the correct position but I
wish it didn't take knowing someone
personally in order to say oh actually
maybe I should revisit my position but
I'll take it either way
yeah and another thing about this is
that John Bainer is a chain-smoker
that's well known I know when Paul Ryan
took over a Speaker of the House he
waited like a few weeks until the office
was fumigated before he moved in there
because it just wreaked of tobacco guys
used to smoking I wonder if instead of
regulars back home you get a little bit
that wacky tabacky and yeah I have to
change his mind just because of that I
wouldn't be at all surprised I would not
be at all surprised if that was the case
all right John Boehner yes because he's
a lobbyist now yes because he's out of
office and no longer raising money for
reelection but he at least has taken the
correct position on cannabis
legalization we will follow it that's it
for today's bonus show brand-new program

okay let's talk about Fox News's Laura
Ingraham you might recall that Fox News
host Laura Ingraham took what sort of
seemed like an abrupt vacation after
about a dozen of her advertisers stopped
buying ads on her show as a result of
her comments about david hog david hog
is a student from the parkland Florida
high school that suffered a mass
shooting a few weeks ago and david hog
himself after laura ingraham did this
called for a boycott of her show an
advertiser boycott of her show on
twitter and on a dozen or more a really
dozens of companies that were
advertising on her program and before
her abrupt vacation about a dozen of
those companies had already bailed and
then she very very quickly announced
that she was taking a week off for
Easter it's possible that that week off
was pre-planned and it just wasn't
mentioned it might not have been the
timing of it was pretty weird but she
did return right that was part of the
question because when Bill O'Reilly
ultimately lost his program on Fox News
he took a very sudden week or two off
was it a week or two I don't remember
and very quickly thereafter the show
went away but Laura Ingraham did come
back but not too good news and in fact
the number of advertisers dropping her
show increased from 12 to 20 by the time
she was back for her first post Easter
break show on Monday and that's at least
20 advertisers that have dropped her
show that we know about and the latest
one here is Allstate Insurance the
difference seems to be that Allstate is
kind of being more subtle so there are
companies that when they decided to drop
advertising with Laura Ingraham they
tweeted about it they put out a press
release about it they made it known that
they were pulling ads and if media
reached out to them to say are you
pulling ads they would say yes Allstate
is taking a bit of a different approach
they've not been answering questions
they were asked to confirm that they
pulled ads and they said we've taken
note of your concerns which isn't an
answer
all to the question of are you still
answering advertising on the program
they were asked are more ads scheduled
to run on laura ingraham show and
allstate said we cannot answer that
question so they might be taking the
more subtle approach which is they're
dropping the ads but they're not making
noise about it
Ace Hardware took that approach men's
clothing store Joseph a bank said listen
we were never actually buying on laura
ingraham show we were buying generally
on Fox News but Joseph a bank ads have
sort of mysteriously or not so
mysteriously disappeared from laura
ingraham show as well and i'm kind of
mixed about this the the subtle strategy
the subtle strategy of pulling the ads
because on the one hand I like the idea
of just pulling the ads quietly not
making a big hubbub for publicity and
just saying we're just not going to fund
the program anymore but it can also be
sort of a calculated thing right because
you might say well pull the ads the
people that are paying close attention
to who's advertising will notice it and
they'll reward you they'll be happy
right the people who are on the sort of
the side of David hog but by subtly
pulling the ads without making an actual
announcement about it maybe the people
that would boycott you for pulling the
ads won't notice because you're not
drawing attention to it in any case the
pulling of the ads is a good thing and
there there's still people saying these
are limits on free speech this is a form
of censorship it's just such a bogus
perspective and a misunderstanding of
what censorship and free speech really
are I was actually talking yesterday
about this with Stamp seed or host of
the majority report it's good not to
fund propaganda it's good not to fund
people who criticize students at high
schools that suffered mass shootings
right it is objectively good and people
will say to me but David you could be
hurt by that same sword that's a double
edged sword if I support the boycotts by
advertisers of other programs to the
point that those programs could go out
of business I also could be the
of the same type of advertiser boycott
listen if I say something that is so
upsetting to people and so disturbing
and so horrible that my audience
activates or people not in my audience
and go to advertisers and say look at
what David said pull your money if I'm
saying despicable things then the case
can be made that I deserve to be
boycotted and that my speech has
consequences and my speech having
consequences is not the same as some
kind of blanket censorship or
restriction on free speech and people
will remind me of YouTube's ad pocalypse
that was not a targeted boycott of me
for the things I said it was horrible
and I am completely against what
happened and everybody knows the extent
to which it hurt the program during 2017
but that was something that happened to
cross news and politics it happened to
conservatives and liberals and it was
about advertisers becoming sort of
skittish about having their ads appear
on edgy content or controversial content
that is completely different than me
saying something and then that speech
having consequences and advertisers are
free to make the choice about where to
support me whether to support me or not
we have a good relationship with the
advertisers that we have and who would
it who would I be to say you can't
decide on the basis of my content
whether or not to keep advertising so
good luck convincing it to the fans of
Laura Ingraham this has nothing to do
with censorship this has nothing to do
with free speech this has to do with
companies with a profit motive making
decisions using whatever barometer they
have whatever rubric they have to decide
where do we advertise and where don't we
advertise and I'm glad that 20 or more
advertisers are saying we're not going
to advertise with Laura Ingraham anymore
give us a like on Facebook facebook.com
slash David Pakman show we will take a
quick break and be back with more after
this we've talked about how more and
more Republicans have been opting to
retire and not seek reelection rather
than risk being taken out maybe by a
Democrat
maybe by a non-trump affiliated
republican and this is all as a result
of the damage that Trump has done to the
Republican Party we've seen a number of
Republicans say they're not going to run
for re-election this morning we learned
that this phenomena goes all the way to
the very very top because Republican
Speaker of the House Paul Ryan the third
in command in the United States
political hierarchy is not running for
re-election and of course Ryan is
telling a very very positive story
saying he's leaving Republicans in good
hands he's had 20 years it's a good run
he wants to spend more time with his
kids but this is not like the beautiful
riding into the sunset that Paul Ryan is
trying to portray and there is every
indication here that there is major may
Anik in the Republican Party and the
decision even surprised many Republicans
that Paul Ryan wasn't going to be
running for reelection as soon as Paul
Ryan announced which was broken earlier
today Republican congressman Dennis Ross
of Florida also said he is going to be
retiring and Speaker of the House is
just not a position you bail on if it
appears that you've got sort of a clear
sailing path to maintain it and that
doesn't mean that Paul Ryan's
explanations aren't valid right I'm sure
he wants to spend more time with his
family
I think his daughter was like an early
teenager when he became Speaker of the
House and you know I totally get it
right he wants to spend time with his
family he has been in there 20 years but
most people would decide to stick it out
just a little bit longer if they have a
clear opportunity to make it another
couple of years in a position of such
power and it isn't even clear that
Republicans are going to maintain the
house at all never mind Paul Ryan in his
specific seat and if they did maintain
control of the house in the midterm
election would it be a productive
context for such a beleaguered to borrow
a word from Trump a beleaguered Speaker
of the House in the sense that many
trumpets aren't loving what Paul Ryan
has been doing been doing it's gonna be
a very interesting midterm and actually
I don't know if you've been following
the iron stash of Bryce
Randy Bryce Randy Bryce is a Democrat
who's
against Paul Ryan in his district in
Wisconsin it was understandably sort of
a longshot candidacy Bryce was building
momentum and he has growing name
recognition within within the district
but running now rather than against Paul
Ryan running against or in an open seat
election in Wisconsin is a very very
different scenario and if you're in
Wisconsin and you're thinking about
getting involved in a race there it
would be an amazing victory to not only
take out a Republican seat but the one
previously held by the Speaker of the
House the retiring Speaker of the House
and bring that back to Democratic
control so we'll be watching that
particular race I will also be watching
sort of the ripple effect over the next
two or three weeks of more Republicans
saying you know I want to be with family
or I want to move on to private law
practice or become a lobbyist or
whatever the case may be
I would predict in the next two to three
two to four weeks you're going to see
even more Republicans sort of put their
finger in the wind and feel the
direction that things are going and join
Paul Ryan in this and and as I mentioned
trumpets might not actually be upset
that Paul Ryan isn't running for
re-election because many of them see
Ryan as a sort of non Trump friendly
force in the Republican Party so I think
many of them would actually cheer it
send me your thoughts what do you think
that Paul Ryan's retirement resignation
call it what you will means about the
2018 midterm elections and even more
broadly sort of about the future of the
Trump presidency I'm on Twitter at D
Pakman and the show is on Twitter at
David Pakman show I have some news that
might be shocking to a lot of people in
our audience if I say the number ninety
seven percent and climate change a lot
of people in our audience know that that
refers to the supposed consensus in our
scientific community that human actions
on our planet are causing climate change
and this is a number that's very often
cited we have a ton of science around
this number we have a ton of studies
that defend this number there's 97%
consensus and I have what might be very
very surprising news for many people in
our audience today
which is that I'm ready to come clean
and admit that the 97% number is flawed
it's just it's not an accurate number I
don't want to call it fake news because
that's giving them a win on the language
which I don't want to do but it's in an
incorrect number and if you're a climate
science denier and you're starting to
feel aroused and titillated by what I'm
saying I want to encourage you to keep
your clothes on just for a second
because it's not that 97% is too high it
actually is drastically low it appears
that the real consensus over recent
history on human influence of our
climate is 99.94% not 97% and this is
based on a new meta-analysis that looked
at more than 50,000 peer-reviewed
climate change articles from 91 to 2015
and it's not 97% consensus it's 99.94%
and even that number might be too low
because if you look at not 91 - 2015 but
just like the last few years it appears
to be 99.99 percent consensus that human
activities on our planet are influencing
the climate and one of the major
problems is that belief in the science
is extremely politicized and if you look
at a recent Gallup survey which asked
people basically three questions are you
worried about climate change do you know
that there's a scientific consensus and
do you believe that humans are causing
it Democrats overwhelmingly believe that
those three things are true right 85 to
90 percent of Democrats are worried they
believe that there is a scientific
consensus and they believe that humans
are influencing the climate on the other
hand only 35 to 42 percent of
Republicans are either aware of or
concerned about or believe that humans
are influencing the climate so this gets
us to what I call informational
incongruity ok I've talked about this
before
this this is something that the audience
seems to react very positively to
because it identifies what I think is a
major problem level one is like we know
about an issue we agree that it's an
important issue but we just disagree on
our position is different right so like
abortion abortion is a political issue
we could debate whether it's resolved
based on roe v wade but we have
significant disagreement about what the
policy should be on abortion a level ii
disagreement would be we generally know
about the issue but we disagree how
important it is so like before same-sex
marriage went national as a result of
the Supreme Court decision most people
were aware of the controversy over
same-sex marriage but some people just
didn't really care about it as an issue
they didn't think it was anything we
needed to deal with like listen it's
just not legal in some places and that's
good and I don't care about that level
three is a lot of people don't know
about the issue level three
informational incongruity that's like
Fox News viewers who might have no idea
that there's a major investigation into
what took place between Trump and Russia
we can't even debate the merits of it we
can't even debate the importance of it
because some people aren't even aware
that it is going on and on climate
change that's kind of the direction that
things are going you don't even have a
majority of Republicans realizing that a
scientific consensus exists so number
one I don't think anyone's going to be
influenced because the real number is
ninety-nine point nine four versus
ninety seven because if you already
trusted the 97% number you're not going
to change your position because it's now
ninety-nine point nine four and if you
weren't aware of that number or believed
that it's fake anyway you also don't
care if it goes from 97 to 99 so I
actually don't know how we can really
get beyond this and start figuring out
what to do about the climate science
issue but the numbers are stunning and
at this point completely undeniable and
I'm curious whether you've experienced
these sort of Sciences your religion
people there's people who will write in
to me unless a David you're doubting
science in a faith-based way the same
way that people tell religion and I have
to explain that people will hold on a
second science has built in self
correction mechanisms and in fact in
science people are encouraged there are
major rewards for people who can poke
holes in what are the accepted
scientific consensus consensus consensus
is I don't know what the plural is you
can win a Nobel Prize
if you debunk the consensus on science
where do you see that in religion you
just don't you just don't but I think
the religion
connection is actually closer to
politics because there are people doing
politics as religion and I think it's
bleeding into science because what you
find is like you said there's die-hard
Republicans that as part of their
Republican identity sure are saying that
this science is just it's bunk it's all
a green conspiracy that's a political
religion it really has nothing to do
with the science the thing that gives me
a lot of hope is that when you look at
the presidential elections when you talk
about hardcore Republicans year after
year after year it's about 25 percent of
us so most of us don't fall into that
category seventy-five percent of us
either look at this consensus and go
like yeah it's real or you have the
people in the middle that either don't
know don't care a lot of people it's not
really about climate science so one of
the things that I do on my show is
because that's controversial I talk more
about the pollution because the solution
is the same right not burning fossil
fuels yep so there's ways for us to get
to solutions without having to deal with
the political religions I think one of
them is just taking the 25 percent and
be like you're religious about this we
can't really talk I prefer to talk to
the 50 percent that aren't voting that
are in the middle that just don't know
what to do with this whole situation and
then the people that are already sold
the vast majority of it yeah that is
something I talked about which is you
actually don't need to convince the
outliers and the extremists in order to
win elections because we have 50% voter
turnout in this country and president
Trump conceivably could win re-election
based on a combination of low voter
turnout and our electoral vote system
with an approval in there in the 20s
right in the high 20s you can actually
still win a presidential election
because people don't vote if the vote
out to george w bush yeah if the voter
turnout went even just from roughly 50
to even something like 62 percent you
completely marginalized the ability of
those extremists who have these religion
and the religions go beyond the sort of
political religion I think is an
interesting term because you see those
dogmatic beliefs around
constitutionalism
and constitutional originalism the idea
of the Constitution effectively as a
sacred text similar to the Bible or the
Koran or whatever else you see it with
this what I call strict father morality
strict father
morality is the dogmatic idea that I
claim to want to reduce abortion if I am
a right-winger and then someone comes to
me and says we know how to do it
comprehensive sex education and ready
access to contraceptives I'm against
that if I'm a right-wing conservative
because you are not actually behaving in
the correct way if you have unprotected
protected sex non-procreative sex you
deserve the consequences almost like a
strict father saying if you do it you
should get pregnant and you should be
forced to carry the baby to a full term
and give birth to it that is a dogmatic
idea fundamentally it's not a pragmatic
idea where we actually know what works
to reduce the number of abortions right
and I think it applies even beyond
climate change there's a lot of these
pseudo religious dogmatic ideas the
other one is the free market right that
exists on the right this this sort of
religious approach to the free market we
uh I don't actually think that just
because we agree to the consensus
doesn't guarantee what the policy should
be and I think that that scares some
people on the right certainly the
reduction in fossil fuel use is sort of
an obvious one but I think that there's
just a lot of people on the right who
are scared to admit that they are aware
of the consensus or just agree with the
consensus because they believe that it
big news weekend very exciting Jen briny
from congressional dish podcast is
joining me in studio we'll be talking to
Jen more about her show on the bonus
show and a little bit later today but
she will be filling in for me tomorrow
it'll be a travelled a very very long
travel day I might have picked the most
inefficient flight itinerary to get to
Las Vegas and the reasons why would bore
everybody in here especially Pat so I'm
gonna I'm gonna skip that story and well
how many times only one stop holding on
stop but eight and a half hours of
flying to get to Las Vegas from Boston
and it's it's not gonna be good for
anybody but plenty of time to use
mediocre American Airlines Wi-Fi and to
do work okay I like talking about double
standards and double standards exist for
example when we see the same statistics
either believed or not believed
depending on who's in office and who
those statistics are good for and one
really good example is gas prices I'm
sure you remember when gas prices went
up under george w bush republicans would
say well you know the president only has
limited influence over what gas prices
do and then when gas prices went back
down under george w bush then george w
bush had done a really amazing thing by
pushing gas prices down and then when
they were up under obama the same people
who said the president doesn't really
influence gas prices were blaming obama
and then of course when gas prices came
back down under obama you heard
no-nothing effectively from republicans
crediting him and the reality is usually
more nuanced that's not one or the other
it's well presidential fought policy
sort of creates the context in which gas
prices could go up or could go down but
it's not really the president themselves
that's influencing it and for me one of
the biggest double standards around
statistics has been jobs right george w
bush governed over a disastrous economy
under obama we saw a big jobs recovery
millions of jobs created unemployment
went down and republicans sort of were
not really willing to accept this they
popularized the labor participation rate
conspiracy theories i don't know if
that's something you've talked about
I've covered that extensively widely
debunked they've called the CBO data
fake and completely not believable and
the truth is that if we look into the
economic situation we see that listen
the
resident of course has some to do with
jobs numbers but there's broader
economic circumstances Bush had a bad
economy and a terrible stock market
partially because of 9/11 we could
debate how much he was directly
responsible for 9/11 needless to say the
2008 recession which came as a result of
the mortgage crisis and the credit
crisis certainly deregulation in general
impacted that but it wasn't george w
bush specifically who did all of that
deregulation and there's no doubt that
under the obama presidency we were due
for somewhat of a recovery but the
stimulus and some other Obama policies
probably helped but that's where we get
to our current president Donald Trump
and the recent jobs numbers which are
not the best jobs numbers only about a
hundred and four thousand jobs created
in March which was almost half of the
nearly two hundred thousand jobs that
economists expected to see created and
these are the same numbers gen that
under President Obama Donald Trump said
were fake numbers and not believable
early in Trump's presidency when the
numbers were still looking pretty good
all of a sudden they were bragging
rights for Donald Trump about how good
the economy was and then now all of a
sudden that his jobs numbers are falling
short of expectations we hear nothing
about the jobs numbers at all do you
think that the average trumpet even
cares about this like dude does it even
matter to them what's going on with the
jobs numbers or is it really all
narrative for them I think it's all
narrative I mean I don't even think that
they're aware of this report to be
honest it's whether or not they have a
job and so yeah I don't know a ton of
Trump voters either there is also that I
live in California but um the few that I
do know they're more concerned with
their own health insurance in their own
little worlds and they just like the guy
I mean I think it just comes down to
that he's the straight talker or
whatever I don't know I don't think that
these are the type of people that are
looking at jobs reports because if they
were they probably wouldn't be voting
for John Donald Trump the the most
depressing thing to me is that job
creation over several years really
hasn't changed
in other words when you adjust down so
the January and February numbers that we
initially got that were initially
reported were actually revised in the
downward direction and they were
actually 50,000 fewer jobs created in
January and February and when you really
look over the long term including the
last few years job creation has been
relatively stable across the last few
years of Obama and Donald Trump and for
me the real disappointing part is that
it would be great if we could sort of
get beyond the politicization of any one
month and sort of look at the broader
trends and the realization that number
one if you didn't believe the numbers
under obama and you believe them under
trump but when they're good or not
that's a double standard that's
hypocrisy and that should really concern
all of us but the broader concern for me
is that number one the job creation wave
that's been touted by the current
administration doesn't really exist
we're really very very close to them to
mean job creation but most importantly
nobody's doing anything to solve the
impending job crisis and wigs
wage stagnation that we've had right
technological unemployment is coming we
don't really have any plan to deal with
it and as I've talked about before
presidential candidates don't want to
talk about that because whoever flinches
first and says hold on a second Trump
says he's gonna bring back jobs from
China a lot of those jobs don't exist
they've been replaced by machines as
soon as one candidate says that the
other will say that's a defeatist
attitude and that certainly doesn't
sound like you're gonna fix the problem
even though the truth is neither party
is actually dealing with that and I feel
like both Democrats and Republicans are
basically given a pass on that issue I
think that's true and I think we also
have a problem where we blame and give
credit to the president for things that
the president like you said before
doesn't really have any control over so
when we're talking about something like
creating jobs and really deciding how
the economy functions so much of that is
done by Congress through legislation
with tax credits and and who it gets
advantages and who doesn't and it's also
to the Justice Department like when you
think about the end of the Bush years
the Justice Department wasn't going
after white-collar criminals and that's
really what crashed the economy it was
this mortgage crisis where there was
just fraud everywhere and and then in
the Obama administration to be fair they
didn't prosecute it either so this stuff
is still happening and I think that type
of thing
allowing corporate crimes in allowing
massive layoffs and just allowing the
stuff to go on a lot of it isn't with
the President himself there's other
parts of our government that are acting
that are being ignored and of course
this isn't to say it doesn't matter
who's president right because of course
what we have is a situation where when
one party does control all three
branches rather the House Senate and the
White House that provides significant
political cover so just because we can't
point to a specific action or Anika nama
CRA's alt and say here's what the
President did that caused it there's no
question that when you have everybody on
the same page you do have political
cover and nobody is really going to go
out of their way to say hey the people
in my party are actually exacerbating
this even if it is the house or the
Senate and not the president that's
doing it I think there's also a case to
be made that there were so many jobs
made under Obama that there are just
fewer to go around now like the
unemployment rates you look at over 4%
you know Trump can't really keep that
job creation going and he could make
that argument that there just aren't as
many jobs to go around now but it
doesn't really fit in with his style
that's not that's not the braggadocio or
used to it Trump that's an example of
the sort of realism that there it's a
no-win for anybody to bring that up as I
mentioned before like when when Mitt
Romney was running against President
Obama in 2012 and he was going to he was
making economic predictions about what
would be going on he made some that were
crazy like every college graduate will
have a job of course that's not true
it's an impossible promise but it was
pretty clear to the extent that we can
even make economic predictions and our
ability to do that is admittedly
somewhat limited it was pretty clear
that the second term of Obama or the
first term of Romney was going to
generally be a pretty good economic
period of four years could have varied
of course depending on whether it was
Romney and Obama whatever Romney tax
cuts for the rich would have been put in
place probably would would not have done
much to stimulate the economy but to
some degree like there are economic
cycles and it's it would be refreshing
to hear that sometimes that's true and
that's why people support the david
pakman show to the extent that they do I
think that's a good thing if we're so so
to get back to my main point what we
really need is sort of some
comprehensive way of a
Society saying hey a lot of jobs are
going to continue disappearing
technology is getting rid of a lot of
jobs we continue to see increased
productivity from people who are working
but they're not getting those wages
those wages are actually going to
stockholders and to the owners of the
company and that's really the problem
that needs to be dealt with and it's
just not being dealt with and we're not
going to see it dealt with when we have
four-year presidential cycles members of
the House of Representatives with
two-year terms who go directly back into
campaigning what's the incentive right
there's just no incentive and you cover
this in the house in the House and
Senate in particular what could be
changed to actually create an incentive
to deal with the long-term problems when
you've just got to raise money to be
re-elected another 18 months from now I
just don't see it yeah exactly and I
think there's also when we're talking
about jobs in particular we also have to
keep in mind that when they're counting
jobs are those jobs part-time are they
paying $7 an hour or are they actually
helping the economy because what you
need are people that have money to spend
right you need people that are able to
go to restaurants you need people that
are able to go and go shopping but if
you're getting paid $7 an hour and you
live in let's say Northern California
where you can't even live anywhere near
your job your money goes to
transportation it all goes to rent you
have nothing left over yeah you can look
at the jobs report all day but if it's
those types of jobs that are being
created we're not really helping the
economy or our society as a whole I've
expressed as Pat knows some concerns
about how universal basic income is
being touted and I think it's a great
idea and in fact I think we're going to
need something like it but I don't know
if you've been following how Mark
Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos and a lot of
these effectively de facto oligarchs of
major American industry are really in
favor of it and my concern is that if we
figure out we're going to give people
nine thousand dollars or twelve thousand
dollars or sixteen thousand dollars or
whatever you're going to not fix a lot
of the systemic problems that exist in
terms of the inequality in corporate vs.
employee negotiating power we have
almost no union representation in the
country it's not going to address the
fact that health care costs are out of
control and many people still don't have
access I want universal basic income or
something like it to the extent that it
will actually fix some of the
problems you're describing but I want to
be sure that it's not just going to be a
way to give people another 10 grand 9 of
which will be spent on Amazon stuff that
people don't really need type of thing
and I don't know how you deal with that
well I mean instead of maybe universal
basic income maybe Universal housing you
know so you just have a small apartment
that you would get we can call them the
projects we can call them whatever but
just to give people basic shelter
because coming from Northern California
I can tell you that we have humans
living all over the place in the streets
and under freeways and and so I just
think when you think what humans need
their basic needs food shelter water if
we can take care of that then the cash
can take care of itself but like you
said like let's say you're getting
$10,000 I don't know even a $10,000 what
I don't know the numbers when people are
talking about universal basic income
that's a factor too I don't know how
much we're talking about two general
ideas one is ubi by itself provides a
living wage as defined by what is
necessary for usually the idea is a one
or a two bedroom apartment plus
reasonable food cost like it really
covers all basic expenses those are the
sort of more ambitious proposals the
other idea is what if everybody just
gets 10 grand added on whether you're
working or not it's not means-tested if
you're super rich you get the 10 grand
if you're if you make no money you get
10 grand and the idea is that by
eliminating all the bureaucracy of
individualized welfare programs you just
save money over the long term by giving
everybody 10 grand but the thing is
that's not a living wage and that's
absolutely concern about it well in it
maybe it is in Central Oklahoma but in
the Bay Area
10 grand isn't going to do anything and
that's where we have so many people
living under freeways yeah so I do like
the idea of providing the things people
need providing these small apartments
and being like listen if you want to
live in this dinky little place that's
not great but it's provided by the
government forever like you go right
ahead and that can be a safety net that
applies to all of us yeah but the rich
people aren't going to take advantage of
that because they don't need the dinky
apartment they have a match and a lot of
people on the right will say well you're
encouraging laziness you're encouraging
people to just live in the quote little
dinky apartment you're always going to
have Free Riders in
system there's a sort of social
insurance system the question is does
society as a whole benefit from reducing
the number of homeless people and if the
answer is yes
what do you care that someone's choosing
to live on ten grand a year if that's
what they want to do we just shouldn't
really be concerned about that is my
view yeah I'm a hundred percent fine
with that because I mean as a woman who
walks alone in the Bay Area all the time
I would like to be able to walk under a
freeway underpass without fearing for my
life there are all sorts of ancillary
benefits and also negative externalities
sort of to be considered here and to
make it politically valuable to I don't
know if you can get there by just
raising taxes on the rich I think it
would have to come from eliminating that
bureaucracy that we see in our social
welfare programs yeah so maybe starting
to eliminate unemployment benefits or
you know like handouts so we call them
and make that into universal basic
income that's probably the best way
forward it's actually fiscally
conservative to do that to consolidate a
lot of these programs eliminate the huge
apparatus of staffing that is there to
determine whether you do or don't
qualify again the concern with what Pat
is saying which I agree with is in the
net you might end up actually not having
people with more resources and then
you're not even really moving from the
the circum to the status quo that we
have today but sort of a different
conversation for ubi maybe for some
other point send me your thoughts I'm on
Twitter at D Pakman are you on Twitter
what is that what's your Twitter handle
at Jen brainy Jen Brian II okay very
good we'll take a break and be back with

okay so as I've told you before the real
story the quote real story with Donald
Trump and stormy Daniels is not whether
Melania Trump knew that Trump was having
an affair or didn't know it's not
whether Trump used a condom as
interesting as I know that that's become
for a lot of people in our audience I've
seen the email some don't care some do
the really important part of the stormy
Daniels story is the possibly coercive
nature of these non-disclosure
agreements that are being used and
number two the potential illegality of
the hundred and thirty thousand dollars
in hush money that stormy Daniels was
paid there are a few different ways that
the hush money might have been illegal
the story were being told is that
because Michael Cohen likes Donald Trump
so much out of his friendship for Donald
Trump out of his genuine love for his
client Donald Trump he decided to cut a
check to stormy Daniels for a hundred
and thirty thousand dollars out of his
own money merely to get her to go away
and not talk about what of course they
maintain is a totally fake allegation of
an affair and he never even asked Donald
Trump for reimbursement to the hundred
and thirty thousand dollars and where it
gets really unbelievable is that Trump
is a billionaire how how many times over
there's disagreement about but I guess
we believe that Trump is a billionaire
Michael Cohen had to mortgage his house
or like get a home equity line of credit
in order to get that hundred and thirty
thousand dollars that he gave to stormy
Daniels and supposedly Donald Trump
never paid coming back maybe because he
had no idea about this it's laughable
right any clear-thinking person
recognizes that this makes no sense
whatsoever there is no chance in hell
that when your clients a billionaire you
just love him so much
that instead of just asking him to
reimburse you for the hundred and thirty
thousand dollars you mortgage your house
and never tell Donald Trump about it
it's totally not believable but Michael
Cohen's lawyer Cohen himself has
lawyered up right so Trump's lawyer is
Cohen Cohen has a lawyer named David
Schwartz David Schwartz has been going
around
any show that will listen that this is
the story no matter what logic dictates
and David Schwartz was interviewed on
the megan kelly
daily program the daytime program for
all my criticisms about megyn kelly and
this pretty stupid daily show that he
has she made David Schwartz look really
really stupid when he told this story
about a hundred and thirty thousand
dollars paid out of love by Michael
Cohen and it was so bad that at one
point the entire audience is just
laughing at the guy let's look at the
video it's worth seeing the whole way
through to just see how every time he
says it megyn kelly shows the total lack
of credibility that this story has in
business okay it's true but the weird
thing about this case is that Michael
Cohen signed the deal Donald Trump
didn't and you are claiming that Michael
Cohen the president's lawyer and fixer
ray Donovan character never ever told
Donald Trump about it never never never
told him and Michael Cohen dispensed
$130,000 of his own money and never
sought reimbursement from Donald Trump
under percent so the whitby no one
believes that okay yes and the dynamics
of the relationship it was not has
billions of dollars if Michael Cohen
doesn't let me finish my let me Michael
Cohen does have millions of dollars okay
zillions so no millions and billions all
right let me finish my answer okay
Michael Michael Cohen had great
authority within that organization gotta
take care of that I'm talking about the
so now the money you got to see the way
this all comes down first of all he got
approached okay he got approached 19
days or 15 days before the election okay
he got approached it'll take a hundred
and thirty thousand dollars makers up to
it to make this go away he had to make a
decision okay not even challenge I'm
challenging one on the impossibility
it's not that he paid 130 grand for
something he didn't do and never sorry
your birthday for a client when you're
looking at in the vacuum like when but
if you understand the relationship here
it makes complete sense that he's
approached am I going to go to the boss
or am I not going to go to the boss all
right what do I
- he chose not to go to the ball he
chose to take care of this that I
wouldn't he get 130 why would he pay 130
grand of his own money yeah well you
know what you're gonna when Michael
Cohen does come out you're gonna you're
gonna find out the mechanics of that
they're dodging you're getting that
balance I am answer what's the truth the
what the truth is he loves he loves the
boss and he all right who believes this
right and megyn kelly doing a really
good job here of showing that the story
they're telling is ridiculous and by the
way it's still not clear that Cohen
wasn't reimbursed I'm guessing at some
point we will learn that Michael Cohen
was reimbursed for those hundred and
thirty thousand dollars and we will find
out in what way it was done the term we
have to apply here is called Trump's
razor Josh Marshall from Talking Points
Memo and sci-fi writer John Scalzi sort
of together one or both of them built up
and promoted this term you've got
Occam's razor right I love this Occam's
razor simply is if you've got two
explanations for the same occurrence the
simpler one is usually better or more
accurate or set another way the the
explanation for a phenomena that
requires fewer assumptions is generally
the better one sort of like the simplest
explanation is generally the one that we
should prefer or gravitate to not always
true but it's an AI it's a principle
Trump's razor is if you have two
competing explanations for an occurrence
the one that implies the stupidest
behavior by Trump in his cronies is the
one that you go with and by the time
that this is all said and done I think
we might end up with another instance of
that here which is that of all the
different ways in which the stormy
Daniel situation could have been handled
the one that directly implies the
highest degree of stupidity from Donald
Trump and everybody working for him is
the one that ultimately will be the true
one and that might include illegal
payments that might include instances of
absolute and sheer idiocy and David
Schwartz truly gutted here I mean
embarrassingly so by Meghan Kelly in
this interview their claims are falling
apart
every time we learn a little bit more
about Michael Cohen the more he seems
genuinely like a mafia thug type
character working for Donald Trump and I
don't believe for a moment that Trump is
just totally in the dark about what it
is that's going on discuss this with us
on our subreddit at david pakman.com
slash re d di t I wanted to talk about
this yesterday but didn't have time last
week after weeks and weeks of not taking
questions in a press conference after
days of having nothing public on his
calendar whatsoever Trump decided to do
basically a campaign rally he went to
Ohio to do a rally in front of a
friendly crowd it's kind of like what
you do when you're running for president
supposedly it was going to be an
infrastructure speech by the way how
often is it infrastructure week it seems
like almost every week in this
administration is infrastructure week
Trump went completely and totally off
the rails it turned into a very strange
garbled rant resembling the English
language only loosely and demonstrating
a sort of Sarah Palin like inability to
communicate anything of meaning through
language and it got so bad that the
three major cable networks CNN MSNBC and
Fox News Paul just cut away from the
speech although you'll be pleased to
know that good old Fox Business Network
stayed with the entire thing all the way
through here is Fox bailing when it got
weird former george w bush white house
press secretary dana perino who's now a
fox news anchor fittingly explaining
that they are going away and she looked
sort of in physical pain as she said it
32,000 soldiers are even watching
president Russell is in Ohio giving a
speech wide-ranging speech but mostly
focusing on his infrastructure plan and
former White House deputy chief of staff
Karl Rove is back with me I like that
wide-ranging is code for Trump is all
over the place real quick go to Karl
Rove to try to say this it save us here
so even Fox cutting away even though
they did stay with it a few minutes
longer than CNN and mint and MSNBC so
here just random weird moments the
entire speech was totally off the rails
all right here's just a random 20
seconds of Trump from this speech we're
a very important
and respected in some circles Democrat
said we want to get rid we should get
rid of our Second Amendment in other
words get rid of it that's really good
it could be right about that so we're
going to protect our Second Amendment
that's not going to happen we have the
best judges we put on a tremendous
amount of great Federal District Court
judges will be setting records we are
setting records appeals court judges
Supreme Court judge fantastic justice
Gorsuch what is he talking about setting
records like what what the hell is this
guy on just another few seconds from
Trump's bizarre speech that networks
couldn't even stay with and we didn't
have one Democrat who voted they want to
raise your taxes and they want people to
come in from the border and they want I
guess want I can't imagine they want but
certainly drugs are flowing across
borders we need walls we started
building our wall I'm so proud of it
I started we started we have 1.6 billion
and we've already started you saw the
pictures yesterday I said what a thing
of beauty and on September 28th we go
further yeah that was a lie by the way
the pictures he's referring to were from
the replacement of two miles of border
fence dating back to the 1990s we've got
one more clip again just disjointed
rantings of a madman we spent and I was
against it from the beginning they try
and say well maybe not I was against it
from the beginning and by the way we're
knocking the hell out of Isis will be
coming out of Syria like very soon let
the other people take care of it now
very soon very soon we're coming out
we're gonna have a hundred percent of
the Caliphate as they call it sometimes
referred to as land take it all back
quickly quickly
but we're gonna be coming out of there
real soon gonna get back to our country
where we belong where we want to be but
just think of it we spent as of three
months ago
seven trillion dollars not billion not
million seven trillion with the T nobody
ever heard of the word trillion until 10
years ago we spent seven trillion
dollars in the Middle East we'd build a
school that blow it up we'd build it
again they'd blow it up we'd build it
again
has it been blown up yet but it will be
but if we want to school in Ohio to fix
the windows you can't get the money if
you want a school in Pennsylvania or
Iowa to get federal money you can't get
the money we spent seven trillion
dollars in the middle east and you know
we have for it nothing remember I used
to say keep the oil as a civilian
I used to say did anybody hear me say
that that's before I decided to go in
this journey with all of you I got tired
of watching what on earth is this guy
talking about i it is the disjointed
rantings of someone who understands
nothing it's always infrastructure week
or month or whatever nothing actually
happens except Trump just showing up and
talking about his random random musings
here and it's there's two phases of a
Trump speech there's the horrible syntax
of the teleprompter reading where he's
looking off at an angle and saying and
if we were to become a better nation of
and then we would write like it's just
he can't read it it just makes no sense
whatsoever and then you see when he
shifts off the teleprompter and look
straight ahead and but then you don't
even know what the guy's talking about
because he's just completely off the
rails and improvising and I hope that
soon we actually get a press conference
supposedly he's doing one today
questions like mr. president can you
just say definitively did you have sex
with stormy Daniels did you realize that
your people were knowingly and directly
dealing with Russian intelligence
officers did you know about the hundred
and thirty thousand dollars that Michael
Cohen paid stormy Daniels have you
reimbursed some specific questions and
you can't put him out there because he
could end up saying something horribly
self incriminating so I hope we get a
press conference
soon these speeches are but so bizarre
that even FoxNews had to cut away from
them even if he did get those questions
though I think he would go off on a
tangent about how he won the 2016
election it was greatest victory of all
time
baby got to deflect maybe he would but I
think he would very likely end up saying
something totally totally self
incriminating and it's pretty clear
they're trying to keep him away from
those types of questions hopefully he
will get some today bizarre speech that
a lot of people on our subreddit noticed
and you can join that discussion if you
can stomach it at david pakman.com slash
re d di t if I tell you that someone
talked sense on Fox News you would
immediately know that it was either
shepard smith or less likely but
possibly chris wallace someone talked
sense on fox news yesterday insta
fact-checking Donald Trump's bogus
claims about Amazon and Jeff Bezos
straight-up telling his audience none of
what you heard was true and it was
indeed Shep Smith let's check it out
we're gonna start with Donald Trump's
claims about Amazon and their deal with
the post office that Trump completely
misunderstood he also took aim today
again today at Amazon the post office is
losing billions of dollars and the
taxpayers are paying for that money
because it delivers packages for Amazon
at a very below cost and that's not fair
to the United States it's not fair to
our taxpayers and Amazon has the money
to pay the fair rate at the post which
would be much more than their thing
right now we're giving a subsidy to
Amazon and we're talking about billions
of dollars a year but the real cost and
a report just came out they said a
dollar 47 I believe or about that for
every time they deliver a package the
United States government meaning the
post office loses $1 47 so Amazon is
gonna have to pay much more money to the
post office yeah okay so that stuff is
not true it's just not but usually you
don't hear that fact-checked on Fox News
but look at Shep Smith go the Postal
Service's own numbers show it makes
money by delivering packages for Amazon
and other company
as for taxpayers the post offices own
website points out and I quote the
Postal Service receives no tax dollars
for operating expenses none and that
reference to a dollar 47 that the
president came up with their a Citigroup
study last year showed on average the
Postal Service was charging a dollar 46
below market rates for package delivery
but our researchers point out if that
discount exists it's not just for Amazon
it's a bulk rate discount back to John
Roberts there is a great deal of
confusion or something here regarding
Amazon in the post office because none
of that none of that was in it was true
that's right it's just not true and it's
too complicated to explain to Trump and
the entire Amazon package delivery world
is super interesting aside from whether
we like or dislike Amazon as a company
aside from whether Trump gets it there's
a lot of really interesting stuff Amazon
does they have huge market power they
strike deals with UPS and FedEx and the
post office they purchase a fleet of
planes to do some of their own shipping
it's all really interesting but as far
as what Trump is saying the bottom line
is that USPS offers $1 47 bulk rate
discount from market rates it's not
necessarily a loss it's just a discount
it's not just for Amazon and the reason
for all of this stuff is partially that
Trump just doesn't like Jeff Bezos
because Bezos owns the Washington Post
and The Washington Post has been doing
really good critical investigative
journalism related to Trump's
administration and then behind all of
this is probably the idea as we'll touch
on with Corey Dugan next week when he's
back on the show that Trump would love
to privatize USPS to some degree the way
he wanted to privatize the VA and just
likes the idea of privatization but I
don't want to get hugely off track I've
explained this before the biggest reason
that conservatives say we should
privatize the post office is because on
paper they're not doing well financially
which is because they are required to
pre-fund something like the next 50 or
75 years of retirement benefits for
employees which is absurd I'm forgetting
the exact details offhand but in any
case it's it's it's Trump likes to call
it this was a Nancy Pelosi beauty or an
Obama
Beauty it's a right wing beauty to
constantly go back and talk about
privatizing the post office and that
that's just something that I don't see
happening anytime soon people wondering
how does Shep Smith get away with this
stuff a couple possibilities-- he might
have an ironclad contract I don't know
about that the other possibility is that
it's sort of calculated by Fox they say
listen what we're gonna let Shep say
whatever he wants the rest of the
network is complete right-wing lunacy
and then anytime we get called out we
can always say listen we've got a range
of opinions on the show we've got all
this stuff and then we've got Shep Smith
and they can sort of use Shep to try to
deny their bias ultimately it's very
very fun to watch the trumpet's go into
cognitive dissonance shock how how can
Shep be doing this how can any of this
stuff be true they're disrupting my echo
chamber yeah and you know Trump takes
everything he hears on Fox News is
gospel true so maybe this will cause him
to reevaluate his position on this maybe
he'll figure out that he was wrong about
Amazon in the post office
my sense is he's just not watching Shep
Smith I don't know I've never even heard
Trump mentioned awareness of Shep Smith
at any time so I think it's mostly Fox
and Friends and Hannity that Trump is uh
sort of paying attention to let's take a
quick break Amanda Marcotte joins me
next I love this story the Catholic
Church and the Vatican are now
scrambling after Pope Francis sort of
appeared to question whether there even
is a hell which is kind of a pretty
basic belief of Catholicism but you
don't have to worry because the flunkies
are claiming he was just misunderstood
what happened is that during a recent
meeting Eugenio Scalf re who's the now
93 year old founder of a Vatican
newspaper asked Pope Francis where do
bad Souls go of course the correct
answer in the context of the Catholic
I'm joined today by Amanda Marcotte she
is a senior political writer for
salon.com focuses on covering the
American right everything from Fox News
and right-wing radio to denialism of
climate change the gun lobby and so many
other things her new book is called
troll nation and there's a lot of very
very interesting stuff in it Amanda I
want to start if it's okay with you you
were involved in covering this movement
known as gamergate several years ago
sort of at the same time when I was
doing some interviews related to the
subject and you've pointed out or at
least sort of drawn a parallel between
what led to the creation of gamergate
and also the forces that ultimately led
to the election of Donald Trump which I
find super interesting because it's
something I've been saying and you often
hear from the gamergate crowd like
listen most most people involved with
the movement or left-wing can you talk a
little bit about the what you see is the
overlap and similarities in those two
groups yeah I mean in in both cases what
you see is a lot of people that have
what you would call white male
conservative you know of various degrees
identity politics and they resent you
know the they resent a changing
demographic of whether it's just video
games or the country generally where
women people of color immigrants are
getting to have not only more in numbers
but also more power and we're getting a
backlash and a lot of that backlash is
justified by characterizing this new
incursion of you know diverse people as
politically correct social justice
warriors so you know the kind of the
reactionary crowd paints themselves as a
victim they say that they'll often even
say they're not racist or sexist that
they just don't like the social justice
warriors with all their demands and
their political correctness pressing
themselves on you so I see a parallel in
that I I think you know these anti
political correctness narratives are a
way to try to create a victim narrative
out of what is actually just the
reactionary movement trying to retain
white male straight white male privilege
in American society or videogames
there's a couple different spots there
that I think are fascinating and really
exposed some double standards and
they'll just pick one of them which is
identity politics then then we can get
to the issues of free speech and
censorship which I think are also
important I've been critical as someone
on the left of some of the ways in which
identity politics has been employed in
in different elements which I think are
not good for the left at the same time
others that I see criticizing identity
politics from the right seem to
basically just have their own identity
Rhian movement and they seem almost
blind to the fact that they just have a
different flavor of the same thing that
they're criticizing the alt-right is a
really really good example that that
we've talked about do you think that
this is a deliberate sort of ignoring of
that double standard or do you think
they are genuinely blind to the reality
that they espouse a version of the same
identity politics they claim to call
destructive when it's the left well you
know I think that I would really reframe
that question because I don't think that
identity politics as they're what are
called identity politics are bad at all
I would say the opposite I say that
there's nothing wrong whatsoever with
the identity politics of the left which
are functionally just asking for equal
treatment for women LBGT people people
of color you know for allowing you know
immigrant communities to thrive things
like that completely and to be favored
clear I completely agree with you with
every every tenet that you've stated
there yeah so when I say that their
right-wing identity politics that's a
very different kind of claim that
they're making and they will often make
it obliquely right by using political
correctness as a cover story but really
the claim that they're making is that
white straight white male privilege
should not be you know challenged in any
way and and that they should retain all
the levers of power in society or at
least the majority of them when it comes
to free speech I see that there's sort
of a similar double standard or
hypocrisy we're sort of even seeing it
now with this Laura Ingraham advertiser
boycott that that we're seeing which is
the
claimed to be a movement all about the
Battle of ideas and no censorship and
getting all of the ideas out there and
sort of letting that debate be engaged
on within a free market of ideas where
nobody is limited in what they can say
but they seem to be against someone
saying I'm gonna use my speech to call
for a boycott of Laura Ingraham they
seem to be against private advertisers
saying hey you know what we can make
decisions about where we do and don't
want to advertise using whatever
barometer is important to us I see the
same double standard yeah and a lot of
troll nation really discusses the way
that the idea of political correctness
and the claims to be censored are mostly
bad faith arguments lies and and and
it's functionally I consider it a hoax
right I it it's it's a way for the right
to sort of once again position
themselves as victims as opposed to like
challenging the ideas like getting into
a real debate and I've written about
this at salon as well I think that a lot
of the time what you see on the right is
they will kind of create situations
where they can kind of pretend to be
victims of censorship so that they can
make the debate over free speech which
wasn't off which was generally not even
challenged in the first place instead of
actually talking about their ideas
because I think they know that their
ideas are repulsive and would never work
on their own but yeah absolutely there's
like an amazing amount of hypocrisy you
know you see it in the fact that they
get angry when there are protests of
right-wing speakers on campus even
though protest isn't it of itself a kind
of free speech and yet they you know
they say you know right-wing speakers
should be allowed to say whatever they
want which I you know tend to agree
that's not the issue here
short of direct incitement to violence I
completely agree yeah yeah but they you
know also have to put up with protest
and that is not you know violation their
free speech rights but then you see
Donald Trump flip around and demand that
the protet the the NFL players who are
kneeling to protest violence against
black people in this country should not
be allowed to do that well that's you
know a blatant call for censorship of
those men's free speech rights and their
attempt to probe
which the NFL you know was basically
kind of allowing to happen in the first
place I think that the this disconnect
is often that there's a group that
claims to be for free speech that sees
the consequences of speech as a
limitation on that speech when hard part
of free speech is that the speech can
have consequences and we're not talking
about violent consequences we're not
talking about the consequence being that
a government tells you that you cannot
speak or threatens to imprison you for
what you said but speech has
consequences protests count as those
consequences advertisers making business
decisions that's all just the freedom of
those individuals to express their
speech and I feel like that's where it
goes too far for many yeah and I think
that I cannot emphasize enough that most
of these right-wing arguments are being
made in like bad faith ok let me go glad
you're bringing that I want to go back
to that because I'm not I'm just not
sure about that like my mind is open I'm
willing to be convinced of that in my
experience I think that a lot of the
people not the people going around
making the arguments and getting all the
attention but the people participating
in reddit discussions and sending tweets
in this type of thing I actually don't
think they're making the arguments in
bad faith I think they've fallen for bad
arguments and that they actually believe
them whole cloth yeah that could be so
like obviously when I'm talking about
you know the riot it's it's my I I get
maybe it wasn't obvious but you know I
am trying to talk about like the
politicians and the pundits you know go
to set the tone you know but I think
like you know in the brooklet awk about
like milo gianopolous constant stunts
right and he he's trying to do this
thing where he goes onto campus and he
he wants the negative reaction he has
created situations where he was not
actually being censored but he would get
get himself caught up in red tape so
that he could declare that he was being
censored because being censored was the
point of it and if he wasn't gonna get
censored he was gonna try to create a
reason to claim that he was being
censored so that's like not only an act
of bad faith but like a really
overtly obvious act of bad faith when it
comes to the sort of what you describe
as Trump trolling attempts right the
coming up with the pejorative titles
like little Marco and crooked Hillary
that type of stuff when he starts with
the Rosie O'Donnell stuff and the megyn
kelly bleeding out of you know where
stuff do you characterize that as a form
of trolling do you think that Trump is
doing it deliberately or that he thinks
that that is sort of valid political
speech in some way like how should we
understand the use of that type of
material by the president you know out
of all the things that of all the
right-wing trolling I think that the
nasty nicknames probably is the least
offensive to me because it's kind of an
empty bit of just childish bullying
right yeah and and and obviously I think
people name call on both sides and I
think overall I don't find that to be
the most harmful aspect of all this I
think what's a lot more harmful is the
way that trolling harassing dogpiling
and culture war antics have sort of
eclipsed any and all efforts at having
like reasonable dialogue or discourse
about ideas period you know a lot of
what I argue in this book is that it's
turned into kind of just a politics of
demonization right and and you mentioned
the Laura Ingraham thing and I think
that's a really good example because
what they've been doing with these
Parkland kids is just shows how empty
like right-wing politics have gotten
they cannot get past they've gotten so
much in the habit of Douma of ad hominem
attacks by saying that liberals are
wrong because liberals are bad people
right that they can't get past it even
with these super sympathetic parkland
gun shooting violence survivors and she
she couldn't help but like try to make a
thing out of his college admissions you
know the fact that he had been denied to
go into UCLA what does that have to do
with gun violence almost absolutely
nothing and yet I don't think that the
right is capable anymore of actually
engaging arguments I think they can all
just shoot the messenger as it were
that's uh I mean are you concerned a
question I get often let me go at it
this way a question I get often from
people in my audience is if when Trump
goes right whether it's short of 2020 or
after a second term or resign who know
whenever whenever Trump goes is there
any undoing this sort of debasement of
the discourse that you're sort of
pointing out here or or is it sort of
now that the door has been open to it
being acceptable at least to a
significant part of the country to do
politics the way Trump did it during the
debates and even now is there any going
back from that and if so what undoes
this damage that's a really good
question and I really wish I had a
better answer part of I think what makes
this complicated is that this predates
Trump and it's not just Trump like Trump
I think is actually the culmination of a
series of events that has been going on
the American right for decades now
starting really with Rush Limbaugh and
Fox News where their argument sort of
came down to liberals are the enemy
defeat them at all costs mock them did
rate you know degrade them and and
really not just dealing with ideas at
all and and the end point was Donald
Trump right this man who doesn't have
any ideas of his own but he knows who he
hates
right and I think that if it was just
Trump it would be a lot easier to walk
it back he's gone we all just pretend
that didn't happen and we move on with
our lives right but that's that rut is
all the way through there the right in
this country you know being a right
winger isn't about having a set of
ideals anymore it's about hating
liberals and wanting to piss them off at
any you know at all at all cost and I
think that I don't know how we're gonna
walk that back I mean I think whoever's
gonna run after Trump is going to have
to either Trump is gonna make it so bad
that this it becomes an actual wake-up
call but that's gonna have to be on
Republicans themselves because we on the
Left can't do anything about that I
would say that which is like
is it sort of up to Republicans in their
next primary to figure out whether this
is the new normal or not yeah and I mean
it's hard to say i mean even mitt
romney's campaign was a little bit empty
wasn't it I mean you think about like
Donald Trump I mean giving stupid
nicknames to people is just a more
childish version of Mitt Romney making
this very empty argument that 47% of
Americans are takers not makers right
and I I think that it's very difficult
because I can't even a point to a
politician on the right now who I think
has ideas that he could campaign on and
win and it's it's a troubling very
troubling trend I mean you know my ideal
would be that it just means that
Democrats completely crushed the next
few elections but I also am NOT that big
an optimist absolutely and I think
people who now are seeing Trump's
approval in the 40s mathematically Trump
can win with the voter turnout that we
have Trump can win with an approval in
the high 20s and that is partially just
the way the system is sort of set up so
one of my at least going into 2018 one
of my biggest messages is no matter what
you think is going on in the Senate
races or congressional races in your
state or district just just go out and
vote because even with very low turnout
mildly unpopular people can can very
easily get elected yeah I mean I would
concur a million times I think that you
know it's clear that the Republican
Party right now is structured around
finding a way to maintain minority rule
without actually having to come up with
ideas that please the public that get
them elected on ideas even through
gerrymandering or these sort of politics
of resentment and fear and you know I
think that our only hope of winning is
being very clear-eyed about that yeah
the book is troll nation we've been
speaking with amanda marcotte who's a
senior political writer for salon.com
amanda great to talk to you I appreciate
it thank you thanks for having me
[Music]
the david pakman show at david
pakman.com I want to start the show a
little bit differently today instead of
talking about the day's news which we'll
get to and we've got a very interesting
interview coming up for you today I want
to talk about a topic that's getting
more and more attention and that's the
topic of universal basic income or some
version of it we've talked about a
negative income tax the point is an idea
of a non means-tested source of money
for people regardless of employment with
the potential to lift a significant
number of people out of poverty and if
you've been watching the show for any
length of time you know that I'm in
favor of something like this and
sometimes we've answered audience
questions about what I prefer a
universal basic income or a negative
income tax do I have a preference do I
think that all social welfare benefits
should be eliminated along with their
respective bureaucracies and sort of
consolidated into one non means taxed
tested universal basic income or do we
want to try to target based on income
levels a big picture I believe that
something like it is is simply going to
be a necessity right as we rethink
society in the next 10 to 20 years
really are sort of forced to reset the
briefing society due to automation and
technological unemployment and the
continued destruction of jobs
elimination of jobs as a result of
technological advances and changes to
our sort of socioeconomic status quo but
in the past
I've not just been completely effusive
and a cheerleader of ubi with no caveats
right I've expressed some concerns in
the past about how ubi would actually be
implemented and what the effect would be
or should be or could be and there's a
very interesting article in TruthDig
that i read yes
today which reminded me that this is an
issue I've been wanting to tackle for a
while and why not today and I don't want
to be cynical right and I and I haven't
wanted to be cynical when talking about
ubi in the past but I've said that when
you see a bunch of ultra rich CEOs and
founders of some of the biggest
corporations especially in tech and
e-commerce companies like Microsoft
Amazon Facebook when you see companies
like that and their CEOs and founders
emphatically and enthusiastically for
universal basic basic income
we should be cautiously optimistic right
hoping that they're in favor of it for
the right reasons but we also want to
kind of verify why are they so thrilled
with the idea of universal basic income
in case in point
Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk and
Richard Branson Bill Gates some less
well-known sort of oligarch rich guys
like Stewart Butterfield they've all
expressed that they like the idea of
universal basic income so okay that's
great but we need to really put a
critical eye on why they are so in favor
of it and also how Universal basic
income could be sort of appropriated for
the good of what our kind of modern-day
oligarchs right the ultra-rich founders
of these major corporations and if you
think about one way to think about this
would be to say all right well if we put
in universal basic income what wouldn't
change like what would stay the same if
we put in ubi
and that can start to sort of give us an
idea about why it might be appealing to
some of the biggest corporations on the
planet if you put in ubi business and
market regulation doesn't change it
remains the same living wage
requirements for people who are working
don't change simply because you put in
universal basic income labor conditions
for people working in not great
conditions right whether it's sweatshops
or whatever the case may be labor
conditions aren't automatically upgraded
because everybody gets eight grand a
year or eleven grand a year or whatever
the proposal might say
in universal basic income college is no
more affordable just because you give
people universal basic income other than
sort of by the obvious nature of them
having a little bit more money but the
problem of the explosive cost of a
college education
that doesn't change merely because you
have universal basic income it's simply
not part of it and in fact there are
many companies that say they want
universal basic income that are the same
companies that are creating a need for
it
outsourcing automation pillaging of
natural resources gigantic carbon
footprints some of these companies
eliminate the need for a lot of these
jobs so they would want people receiving
universal basic income because that's
going to give them that customers that
they would otherwise lose if you start
putting people out of work in the United
States because you outsource production
to China for example some of those
people in the US are no longer going to
be able to afford your product or
service anymore
have the government give them a basic
income and now all of a sudden they get
back into the possible pool of your
customers it's perfect and one of the
big tenants or maybe better said one of
the characteristics of neoliberalism is
free market and corporate power setting
up universal basic income could very
easily be used to number one just create
more customers for the corporations
responsible for eliminating a lot of
these jobs and number two universal
basic income could be used to push back
against regulation and minimum wage laws
and other Pro worker laws right why do
we need to raise the minimum wage we
just put in place universal basic income
let's keep the minimum wage really low
which benefits these really large
corporations except that by keeping the
minimum wage low the corporation's keep
making their executives richer off of
profits at the expense of paying workers
a living wage and they can hide behind
the creation of ubi and in fact we
already see this right companies like
McDonald's
Walmart we've talked about these
companies already in part get away with
paying the terrible wages and benefits
that they pay because lots of their
employees get food stamps and other
social welfare benefits from the
government Social Welfare subsidizes the
terrible wages that some of these very
profitable companies pay in the United
States and UB I could make that way
worse the so called gig economy right
driving for uber and lyft as an example
major problems they're taking advantage
of contractors rather than making the
drivers employees we need to be looking
at a lot of elements of what's going on
there
throw in a basic income give everybody
nine thousand eleven thousand thirteen
thousand dollars a year well why are we
gonna now get involved in making lyft
and uber change their model yeah
working for them doesn't pay that much
but we passed ubi don't go after them
now everybody's got their eight thousand
bucks as a base this isn't an argument
against universal basic income to be
clear this is a word of caution
now that ubi is getting more and more
attention it's a word of caution that we
need to think critically about this and
really think about how it would work in
practice now is there a particular
answer or solution that I'm bringing up
no actually I don't know right what I
can tell you is that universal basic
income needs to work in concert with
other really significant structural
changes to our society that quite
frankly I'm pretty skeptical we're gonna
be making anytime soon and I remain
completely convinced about the need for
something like a universal basic income
or a negative income tax or some other
proposal some of some others of which
I've been reviewing and will talk to you
about but I'm just as as as convinced
that just dropping nine thousand dollars
in everybody's pocket every year or
eleven thousand dollars isn't going to
fix a lot of the structural problems
that we have in our socio-economic
reality and at its core when you give
everybody nine thousand dollars you do
nothing to deal with the problem of in
and wealth inequality which has economic
consequences it has social consequences
it has psychological consequences that
we've talked about about just these
drastic and growing disparities between
rich and poor so what I would like to
hear from you is specifically what else
needs to happen in concert with a
universal basic income to actually make
this something that would be a net
benefit in total aside from just again
dropping nine thousand dollars in
people's laps which i think is a good
thing i think that ubi and these concert
concepts are something that is they're
not only good ideas they're gonna be
necessary ideas in the next ten to
twenty years in the United States but
they're not going to do anything about
so many of the other problems that we
have and what we need to be a hundred
person I needs to be crystal clear as we
advocate for ubi that it cannot be used
by the rich and by big corporations and
by oligarchs to say we don't need to
regulate we don't need living wage we
don't need to do anything else because
we did drop nine thousand bucks into
everybody's pocket that's my concern at
this point I do wonder whether or not
the universal basic income would be
entirely good for the rich in
corporations though because the ubi
would be redistributed right I mean
those that money would have to come from
somewhere it would likely come from the
rich so maybe they would see their taxes
increase so when people like Mark
Zuckerberg or Elon Musk come out and say
we're in favor of universal basic income
maybe they are just acting in the best
interest of the country and want to pay
it forward yeah I mean most of the
proposals wouldn't require an increase
in taxes because you would just
reshuffle other programs that are out
there and you might even actually save
money because you would eliminate the
bureaucracies required for a lot of
those programs so welfare state so in
that case it actually it wouldn't
necessarily have that effect but we'll
follow it I'm interested in hearing from
the audience what your thoughts are I'm

this is something really funny last
night I was browsing the David Pakman
show subreddit and there was a thread
that someone made pointing out that
there should be sort of a David Pakman
show
bingo of sorts showing that there are a
few different catchphrases a sort of
drinking game or bingo of the game any
time david says says the phrase or words
gong show abortive or depraved listeners
have to take a shot and this gave me the
idea that we should actually develop
like a david pakman show bingo board I
don't know what we would do with it we
could turn it into like a thousand-piece
puzzle we could send it out as a sort of
poster print I don't know what exactly
we would do with it and the the reddit
participant is including some good ones
I think also on it would have to be if I
accidentally punch my mic that would
have to be like the center square which
sometimes happens when I get very very
impassioned
about a story I think I say vile quite a
bit depraved is a good one
shows a good one and so is abortive
asking a live caller if they're on
speakerphone should definitely be a box
on the bingo board joking about how
infrequently I mentioned membership I
think might be something that could be
on there quite frankly is another phrase
that I tend to use a lot any number of
is of course a long time classic that
goes back a long ways but I don't know
what else should be on it right and I'm
curious to hear from the audience and I
don't even know like is a bingo board
looks like there are they five by five
is what it looks like from this picture
so we need 25 total phrases or words I
think we can get to 20 yeah I've got a
few too it's a whole thing and then you
also like to impersonate Trump a lot
yeah so many many could be a square
Bigley or big league yeah although I
don't know that it shouldn't when if I'm
satirically using someone else's
catchphrase I think that's a little
dishonest for a bingo board because they
should really be my phrases now that
ones that I've sort of jokingly
appropriated from someone else if we do
this you have to like tune that out
though you can't think about the bingo
board because otherwise there'll be some
like inherent bias there yeah I know
I'll be very losing words they're
choosing not to say some words right but
presumably the bingo boards are
randomized so that not everyone has the
same board and that way cuz otherwise
everybody wins at the same time right as
long as they're there paying attention
so write in tell me what other words and
phrases should should be there any
number I know that there are lots of
others maybe one would be when a hatred
uses your instead of your like you
apostrophe re versus why oh you are like
that would be part of the bingo a bingo
item I'm open okay so get in touch
comment on the YouTube video for this
story comment on that reddit thread at
david pakman.com slash re d di t email
me tweet me whatever i'm gonna start
putting together a list and once we get
25 good ones we'll figure out something
to do with the bingo board i think it's
gonna be a stunningly good idea maybe
you get a free bingo board with a new
membership in the future or something
like that okay big breaking news story
according to the Kremlin Donald Trump
has invited Vladimir Putin to the White
House and you might say well who cares
we should want better relationships with
Russia
we should want to be Russia's friend
this is great yay
and then we get back to reality and we
learned that this reportedly happened
during that same phone call a couple of
weeks ago where after being told do not
congratulate Vladimir Putin on his sham
election win Donald Trump did exactly
that congratulated Vladimir Putin on his
win mentioned nothing about election
meddling mentioned nothing about the
continued suspicious deaths of Russian
dissidents around the world and the
claim about this invitation to maybe
come to the White House for Vladimir
Putin came from a Kremlin aide named
Yuri ochakov who said that Russian who
said to Russian journalists that quote
if everything will be alright
I hope that the Americans will not back
away from their own proposal to discuss
the possibility of holding a summit when
our president spoke on the phone it was
trump who proposed holding the first
meeting in Washington in the White House
Putin hasn't been to the White House
since 2005
when george w bush was president when
the US and russia i guess sort of had a
better relationship you could say so why
do we care well we care because this is
vladimir putin's manipulation of donald
trump bearing fruit right it's another
example of putin getting what he wants
which is be being seen as a sort of
serious world leader that gets invited
and the red carpet is rolled out for
them and they get to go into the most
special of places although certainly the
white the Oval Office has become less
special since Donald Trump has
appropriated it what better situation
for Putin than a long in-person meeting
with Trump on Trump's own turf were
Putin who is very skilled will use his
skills to manipulate Trump and even even
when you look at how we found out about
this right even the release of this news
by Russia is part of the ploy to
embarrass Trump and just create chaos
because now it's win-win for Vladimir
Putin if Trump admits yeah I I did say
that he could come to the White House
well why wasn't it mentioned
and why would Trump do it and why would
he reward Russia with inviting Vladimir
Putin to the White House and then if
Trump denies it it immediately calls
into question whether Trump is lying
something that he does a lot and if so
it would make us wonder why is this
something that Trump would lie about
which only increases more of the
suspicion about what's going on with
Russia the fact that we're first hearing
about this from Russia is sort of part
of the chaos that Russia is so expertly
catalyzing and we once again we've got
to apply Trump's razor to this as I
mentioned yesterday no matter what you
believe the limits of geopolitical
stupidity to be the current
administration the Trump administration
will act in the most ignorant and stupid
way possible to the point that you will
be shocked and in fact the most likely
scenario is that we get initially a
denial from the Trump administration
followed by a White House visit by
Vladimir Putin and then there will never
actually be a follow-up question about
wait I thought you'd deny that you had
invited him to him here the way it
always goes is is some version of that
right we hear from the Washington Post
or the New York Times something that
sounds totally nuts then you know Trump
uses his bathtub as a toilet or
something that sounds absolutely nutty
White House immediately condemns says
the president would never use his
bathtub as a toilet it's the fake news
media including that failing fake news
Amazon Jeff Bezos Washington Post
they're smearing the president then like
two days later Trump goes to Twitter and
says hey yeah alright I use my bathtub
as a toilet and Hillary was using her
bathtub as a toilet before I did and the
FBI refuses to look into when Hillary
Clinton is using her bathtub as a toilet
no one cares about that and I've been
treated very very unfairly and then the
sort of cherry on top is three days go
by and then Trump says why I never said
I used my bathtub as a toilet I was
misquoted by the loser New York Times I
never said it and then a hundred grand
goes to another pornstar in hush money
and we all forget about it because we're
yesterday's White House press briefing
managed well first of all it was managed
not by press secretary Sarah Huckabee
Sanders but by her deputy the deputy
press secretary Raj Shah and it got off
to a very very fast start because after
the endless lies and the lies about
firings and hirings and the lies about
so much Associated Press reporter Zeke
Miller straight up said to rush as soon
as he turned it over for questions after
a couple minute comment why should we
believe anything that you tell us at
this point which is really a pretty
obvious question at this point seen as
very controversial and aggressive but
it's just sort of an obvious question
let's watch and most of what I'm most
interested in is the just laughable
response from Raj Shah here Zeke on
Thursday White House officials run out
of this stage and they said the
president would sign behind me this
legislation on Friday morning he
threatened to veto it awfully excited
ten days ago Sarah said that a charged
ambassador had to present confident
support would be leaving last Thursday
yeah it was advance that he would be
leaving the White House in about two and
a half weeks ago the president expressed
confidence in his attorneys and then
there's a bit of a shake-up there last
week so can you talk to speak to the
White House the credibility why should
we in this room and more important of
the American people trust anything this
administration's telling them well you
know our job is a press office and as an
administration is to give you the best
information that we have available to us
most accurate information in a timely
fashion
sometimes the dynamics are fluid in any
given situation you mentioned some
personnel matters facts and
circumstances changed we continue to
give you guys the best information that
we can as quickly as possible so good
for Zeke Miller right this is a good
question this is the type of question
that should be asked but the next step
if you've got to press them right Raj
Shahs answer is bogus unless the White
House press team is genuinely kept in
the dark about what is going on which is
possible in the Trump administration
anything is possible but it's sort of
hard to believe to say that they give
the most accurate information they have
at the time is obviously not believable
the White House press office hasn't been
in this level of disarray and disrepair
I would argue ever and it goes back to
the first day of this administration and
Sean Spicer who has done more to
embarrass and discredit the office of
the press secretary than any previous
press secretary and it started with his
day one pronouncement I call it the
belligerent pronouncement the coerced
pronouncement we now know by Donald
Trump that Donald Trump had the biggest
inauguration in the history of the
United States period end of story
Spicer started his tenure as White House
press secretary lying about the weather
on inauguration day something that
hundreds of thousands of people
personally experienced and millions more
watched on television and I also want to
point out that not just the lying but
the admitting to lying isn't that rare
in the administration we know that they
like Donald Trump recently admitted as I
covered that he lied to foreign leaders
including specifically Canadian Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau we covered it
when it happened Trump just making up
assertions out of thin air about trade
with Canada just made it up
hope Hicks Trump's former I guess like
her sixth or seventh who knows White
House communications director she
testified a few weeks ago that sometimes
she would lie to the press for president
Donald Trump
Kellyanne Conway concocting the
bowling-green Massacre to justify who
knows what depraved policy of Donald
Trump's that he was pushing at the time
some kind of wall or ban or travel ban
or whatever it was this is what they do
right so the answer to Zeke Miller's
question here is there is no reason why
anybody should trust any of these people
they should not be trusted and even
Trump came up once with the bogus live
just a demonstrable factual lie that he
had the biggest electoral victory in
history he was straight-up called out by
a reporter in person and just listen
Trump expressed no remorse he said I
well that's what somebody told me I
guess it was the biggest electoral
college win since Ronald Reagan
since Ronald Reagan with 300 or 306
electoral votes in fact President Obama
got 365 well I'm talking about
Republican President Obama 331 George HW
Bush 426 when he won as president so why
should Americans trust well no I was
told I was given that information I
don't I was just given we had a very
very big margin I guess I questioned why
should Americans trust you when you look
used the information they receive of
being fake when you're providing
information well I don't know I was
given that information actually I've
seen that information around yeah I was
thinking a lot of people aren't familiar
with that one but it's it's bad there is
only one way in which what Raj said is
true Shaw said that the press office
provides the most accurate information
at the time it's possible they have no
clue what's going on right they the
press office may genuinely have no
reason to think that HR McMaster and Rex
Tillerson are about to be fired even
almost as they are being fired because
they're not being told that it's going
on and that's the one other
interpretation of this and I don't know
whether that's true that would signal a
whole host of other problems going on
within the White House my baby maybe
it's something that we will someday
learn about but hey I wish there were
more follow-up but good for Zeke Miller
for asking the question we can only hope
there's more of this coming from the
press corps I'm on Twitter at D Pakman
show is on twitter at david pakman show
a quick break back after this normally
White House press secretaries know how
to lie in ways that are plausibly
deniable or open to interpretation White
House press secretary Sarah Huckabee
Sanders is now just concocting lies
whole cloth out of thin air you might
remember that yesterday we talked about
the census the 2020 census and I told
you that Wilbur Ross Secretary of
Commerce and his Commerce Department
announced that they are going to bring
back questions about citizenship in the
2020 census and I explained to you
yesterday this is going to hold down the
response rates of minorities they will
be undercounted this will have the net
result of shifting money away from some
of the large blue states with high
immigrant populations like California
and New York State it's gonna play
directly into the hands of Republican
gerrymandering and I also told you that
citizenship questions have not been on
the census since 1950 Sarah Huckabee
Sanders was asked yesterday about this
and she came up with the really specific
lie a totally demonstrable falsehood
that the citizenship question has been
on every census since 1965 other than
2010 what how did she come up with that
we have absolutely no idea here's the
video look this is a question that's
been included in every census since 1965
with the exception of 2010 when it was
removed this is we've contained this
question that's provided data that's
necessary for the Department of Justice
to protect voters and specifically to
help us better comply with the Voting
Rights Act which is something that is
important than a part of this process
and again this is something that has
been part of the census for decades and
something that the Department of
Commerce felt strongly needed to be
included again what is the point of
these briefings when it's just lies and
no real answers to the questions right
that this is transparently patently
absurd Lee false and now that sort of
that that's the big lie right the big
lie is no this has not been on every
census since 1965 other than 2010 this
has not been in the census at all since
1950 that was the big lie there is also
a smaller lie she even though that was
only like a 30-second answer she
actually told two major lies in that one
answer she also said something about the
reason we put that back in is that the
Commerce Department wanted to protect
voters and comply with the Voting Rights
Act that's also made up out of thin air
this is all based on a letter from the
DOJ headed by Jeff Sessions remember
asking that the census add the
citizenship question back in
on the basis of a recommendation from
John Gore John Gore was appointed by
Donald Trump and is best known for
Republican gerrymandering around the
country and that's the point of this
question being added to the census
earlier this week the first question to
the deputy press secretary was why
should we believe anything that you tell
us and I think that the first question
at every subsequent press briefing
should be Sara at the last press
briefing you told us x y&z all of which
were lies will you be telling lies today
and are you willing to clarify those
three lies from the last press briefing
that is how every single one of these
press briefings should be handled and I
hope that today someone says to her Sara
yesterday you said that the citizenship
question has been on every census in 65
other than 20 other than 2010 that
wasn't true can you tell us where you
got that information I hope that they
will ask her that today yeah see about
that there's also some low-hanging fruit
here which is that there was no census
in 1965 the source occurs every 10 years
in the years ending in a 0 like 2012 and
2020 and that was another survey but it
wasn't the census and we're sure that
there wasn't for some reason essentially
every year since 1790 every 10 3 10
years yeah listen that that is like a
tertiary lie at this point where it's
it's barely even registering and I don't
know if the unhinge degree to which
she's still telling these demonstrable
lies is because she sort of gets a kick
out of it I've said it it sort of looks
like she really likes bullying the press
corps and just I apologize for what
might seem as an unsavory comment but
sort of like throwing her weight around
not literally but figuratively or does
she feel like she's being bullied into
telling these lies by Trump or by
someone else I don't know but I'm
starting to get emails from people who
say they feel bad for Sarah Huckabee
Sanders I don't feel bad at all
she deserves to have her political
career destroyed for agreeing to
participate in this no one forced her to
take this job hopefully Sean Spicer's
career is over remains to be seen he may
just be on a sort of political break
until he does his next thing
but III understand how we might all feel
like some of these people are victims of
Donald Trump but she's one of the
perpetrators she may not be the top
perpetrator the perpetrator in chief but
she is a perpetrator here and I don't
feel bad for her whatsoever I think she
could be on her way out too I remember
in the last days of Sean Spicer we saw
less and less of him and more of Sarah
Huckabee Sanders yeah now it looks like
we're seeing more of Raj Shah than you
yeah I perhaps who I also think is an
absolute disaster and would bring a
whole new series of comedic press
briefings but yeah I think that she is
Trump has had at least two instances
major instances over the last month
where he's not been at all happy with
Sarah Huckabee Sanders and we'll see how
long her tenure is as White House press
secretary just making stuff up out of
thin air discuss this with us on our
subreddit at david pakman.com slash re d
di t next medical professor donald light
will join me to talk about
pharmaceutical industry myths looking
forward to that so Reuters is reporting
some potentially a pretty major news we
learned that North Korean leader Kim
jong-un went to China Sunday was there
until today earlier today they're there
12 13 hours ahead of us on a non
official visit and a picture of the two
leaders the chinese president g and kim
jeong-hoon from north korea has been
tweeted by a Chinese news agency Xinhua
news and this was reported originally
all by Chinese news and has since been
confirmed and as far as is known this is
the first time that Kim jong-un has left
North Korea since he took over power
about seven years ago in 2011 and
according to China while in China
President ji and North Korean leader Kim
jong-un have negotiated a pledge from
North Korea to denuclearize the Korean
Peninsula and you will soon see why that
language denuclearize the Korean
Peninsula
not just denuclearize North Korea
riah is very very relevant language for
what maybe in Kim Jong Un's mind here
that goes well beyond just being
semantics and this reportedly took place
during a meeting between the leaders of
the two countries and the immediate
reaction was this this must all be BS
but case in point Kim jong-un has not
left North Korea since taking power so
it's all unprecedented the fact that it
sounds hard to believe really shouldn't
tell us too much because we already know
that the trip in and of itself is sort
of historic at least in the context of
Kim Jong Un's reign in North Korea and
there is plenty of reason to be
skeptical right there's plenty of reason
to believe that Kim jong-un is thinking
of what we think of when we hear about
denuclearizing in the region but the
fact that this might be a thing is more
than enough reason to talk about it and
take it seriously
the real caveat here and I alluded to
this a couple minutes ago is that Kim
Jong hoon more than likely agreed to
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula
in theory if all American troops leave
South Korea which just is not likely to
happen right this is potentially setting
up the United States to be blamed by Kim
jong-un for impeding denuclearization
because Kim jong-un now by saying hey
I'm I'm open to denuclearizing the
peninsula which includes two countries
North and South Korea what does that
mean in terms of how we should interpret
it well the United States military being
the military of a nuclear nation has a
saw a strong presence in South Korea so
what Kim jong-un I believe is
effectively saying here is I'm willing
to denuclearize North Korea if South
Korea is willing to denuclearize in the
sense of getting all military from
nuclear nations out of there meaning
United States troops have to go and it
just seems very difficult to think that
that's going to happen and in fact it's
very likely that this is an attempt not
not a stupid one by the way by Kim
jong-un to take the high ground pull
while he can because there's this window
here where it appears as though we are
going in the direction of talks that
will involve North and South Korea and
the United States potentially at the end
of May of this year just a couple of
months from now there's this window
right now where Kim can take the
political high ground and say I'm ready
to come to the table which by the way
he's always been willing to do he's
always been desperate to get to the same
table as an American president and I'm
willing conceptually in theory to agree
to denuclearize the peninsula which
would more than likely require the
United States to go they meet South
Korea and the u.s. and North Korea and
North Korea says hey we want peace and
stability let's have all nuclear powers
leave the peninsula we will denuclearize
in US troops must leave Trump overreacts
says no and then who knows what happens
and in the interim of course Donald
Trump completely predictably on Twitter
pushing this as sort of a victory
something unique that he has been able
to achieve tweeting this morning for
years and through many administrations
everyone said that peace and the
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula
was not even a small possibility now
there is a good chance that Kim jong-un
will do what is right for his people and
for Humanity look forward to our meeting
and this is just the narrative is so
attractive to Trump he's so obsessed
with the idea as the sole and unique
Broker of progress in the region that he
if he even understands it is ignoring it
but more than likely doesn't know nor
care to understand that when Kim talks
about the denuclearization of the
peninsula he's talking about Trump
pulling troops and he likes the
narrative Trump does of hey I was
elected all of a sudden Kim jong-un
might do what is right it is more than
likely that Kim jong-un is at least on
the path of playing Donald Trump here
and of course Trump's not just not
knowledgeable enough to understand what
it is that Kim jong-un means by the
denuclearization of the peninsula
yeah presidents always take and receive
credit for favorable world events even
if they had little to nothing to do with
it
right and but I think if you if there
was an exchange where Trump is obnoxious
but North Korea decides to denuclearize
and it turns out the whole peninsula
decides the new denuclearize that's good
for us I think in the end uh I mean I
guess I don't know it's just that that
would include Trump saying yeah we'll
pull all of our troops more than likely
and and that's just not gonna happen
last night I decided to turn on the TV
for a few minutes I basically don't
watch news shows or political shows I've
talked about this before I've always got
like some Netflix shows that I'm
watching and yesterday I watched what
did I watch I watched an episode of
hostages great Israeli show finished
watching that an episode of that with my
girlfriend and I said let's just see
what's happening in the news right like
what's happening on Fox News what's
happening on MSNBC what's happening on
CNN I turn to CNN which by and large has
been doing a mix of good reporting on
the Trump administration combined with
some salacious stuff that's less
relevant certainly a much better option
than Fox News for sure and I see
Anderson Cooper who recently interviewed
stormy Daniels on 60 minutes sitting at
his news desk with legal analyst Jeffrey
Toobin Michael avenatti who's the lawyer
for adult film actress stormy Daniels as
well as the lawyer for Trump's lawyer so
Trump has a lawyer Michael Cohen Michael
Cohen is in such hot water now as a
result of the stormy Daniels thing and
the non-disclosures that he has retained
a lawyer named David Schwartz as I told
you before
Trump's lawyer has not lawyer DUP here
because of the trouble that that he
believes Trump is in he's lawyered up
because he potentially is in trouble
tells us how bad things are going this
was one of the most embarrassing and
pointless nearly half-hour segments that
I have ever seen on corporate media to
lawyers yelling at each other the way
they might do 30 seconds before turning
to fisticuffs in a bar right Michael
Cohen's lawyer David Schwartz is on the
most fundamental level a complete and
total embarrassment his mere presence on
the network is shameful stormy Daniels
attorney Michael avenatti he's known as
this really savvy legal operator
Attorney General Jeff Sessions our buddy
might have committed perjury again
remember that Jeff Sessions just fired
deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe for in
part this is so funny lack of candor
during testimony we already know that
back in March of 2017 in a hearing Jeff
sessions said he had no communication
with Russians during the Trump campaign
we later learned that he actually had
multiple communications with Russians
this was the first live from this sort
of series of Lies of course there are
lots of other Jeff Sessions lies
unrelated to this series but just as a
reminder this is how that went down when
being questioned by Al Franken and if
there is any evidence that anyone
affiliated with the Trump campaign
communicated with the Russian government
in the course of this campaign what will
you do senator Franken I'm not aware of
any of those activities I have been
called a surrogate at a time or two in
that campaign and I did not have
communications with the Russians and I'm
unable to comment on total lie probably
perjury he'll never get in trouble for
it though fill the swamp and move on
okay we thought we were done and and
beyond it but sessions testified again a
couple of times including in November of
2017 and that time it was before the
House Judiciary Committee and it appears
that sessions also lied during that
hearing he was asked about now indicted
Trump advisor George papadopolis
Papadopoulos had proposed that Donald
Trump's campaign reach out to Russia
during that meeting that took place on
March 31st of 2016
Trump was at that meeting sessions was
at that meeting other top Trump staff
were at that meeting sessions claimed
during the testimony that he pushed back
against them
that he thought reaching out to Russia
was a bad idea and that he wanted to
make sure everybody in the room knew
that he thought it was a bad idea
unfortunately it appears that that was
also a lie because Reuters is now
reporting that three people who were at
the meeting said no it's not true
sessions expressed no objection
whatsoever to reaching out to Russia and
these three individuals say they've also
spoken to Robert molars investigators
and told Robert molars team that it
wasn't true what Jeff sessions said he
posed no objection whatsoever to
reaching out to Russia now there is I
want to be thorough I'm not hiding
anything from you there's a fourth
person who was at the meeting who says
no no Jeff sessions is telling the truth
he did push back so currently it's three
to one on this issue we can think about
who to believe right do we believe the
recused Attorney General who's already
been caught lying or do we believe the
three people who were in the room and
were interviewed by Robert Moeller's
team and said no sessions didn't push
back at George papadopolis suggestion
that we reach out to Russia you judge
for yourself who you want to believe but
the really depressing part of all of
this is that no one's gonna go after
sessions for perjury right there have
been no consequences for sessions lies
back from March of 2017
there have been no consequences for
sessions for recusing himself on
anything related to Russia and then
firing people specifically to interfere
with the Russia investigation as
admitted by Donald Trump they currently
control every aspect of the government
they seem to be unable to control Robert
Moeller which is good right like we hope
that they're not controlling robert
muller and that that investigation will
happen fully and fairly but we're not
gonna see anybody within trump's
administration hold jeff Sessions
accountable here for recusing and then
being involved and then lying once
during testimony to the Senate and once
during testimony at least once during
testimony to the house Trump could
remove sessions for the lies yeah right
and also we could argue that firing
sessions in a way might be a step
towards firing Muller but I think Pat we
just have to come to terms with the
reality that there's not going to be a
repercussion sessions for having done
this it's not gonna happen and
unfortunately I think sessions view of
in the public has been tarnished I agree
for a time even though we had
disagreements with him he could be seen
as a patriot because he did decide to
recuse himself he's not a complete
Lackey for Trump and it looked like he
wasn't willing to make those contacts
with Russia now we don't know what to
believe yet there was a period of about
three and a half minutes that Pat's
referring to where we had plausible
belief
of what Jeff sessions said before it was
instantly fact-check and realized he was
lying I mean let no it was longer than
three and a half minutes but you're
right like bye and it's not that I would
call him a patriot oh yeah but you're
saying as a straight and standard by the
standards of the committed trumpets
which are shifting standards by the way
you could sort of say like this guy is
not the worst guy out there but yeah
that's gone out the window and there
we're gonna have to just realize that
hopefully some people will be held
accountable for this entire thing that
is being investigated but we're gonna
have to come to terms with the reality
that a lot of them just or not they're
not going to be held accountable and
it's sad I don't know what else to tell
you I wish I had something else I could
say a word of inspiration but I don't as
you know Donald Trump has fired the
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson whether
it was because of Russia or to protect
Jared Kushner we don't quite know we
might never know but what we do know is
that Ivanka Trump the president's
daughter whose band by nepotism laws
from having a formal position in the
administration is sitting in for the
Secretary of State at an upcoming
meeting with the South Korean foreign
minister and the White House is
confirming this the White House is
saying yeah Ivanka who as I told you
last week is still set to her in about a
million dollars this year from the Trump
family business from which she has not
separated herself she will be meeting
with Kang kumoi
of South Korea not only does Ivanka
Trump not have a formal position in the
White House because she can't not only
does she have business interests in the
country of South Korea from which she
still is going to earn money she doesn't
even have a permanent security clearance
presumably because of the problems with
Jared Kushner
and multiple false sf-86 vetting form
submissions and she is going to be doing
something that would typically be the
purview of the Secretary of State's in
related news a panel of Bachelor
contestants as well as the Long Island
medium that psychic woman are gonna be
filling in from Mike Pompeo a CIA
director while he goes through the
process of becoming separate separate
Secretary of State how low are we going
to go here am I being too tough on
Ivanka like can we say that because she
designs some really nice handbag
oh wait a second no they actually paid
someone else to design the handbags I
might prefer the actual Ivanka handbag
designer / Ivanka meet with the South
Korean Foreign Minister all joking aside
this is probably illegal okay there's a
piece of law so we've got the
anti-nepotism laws which say why Ivanka
can't have an official position in the
government there's something else called
inherently governmental functions which
is five US Code 31:10 subsection
employment of relatives which
specifically says there are certain
government functions that are so
intimately related to the public
interest that they can only be performed
by a government employee
this has to be adjudicated right this is
subjective but how can anyone argue that
the functions of the Secretary of State
are not inherently governmental
functions Ivanka Trump is a private
citizen and thus should be forbidden
from participating in these functions
and yet she is and it appears to violate
that law it appears as though there may
be other violations emoluments questions
so much of what's going on here and part
of this of course has to do with the
broader problem of just unfilled
positions in the Trump administration
two-thirds of the top nine jobs meaning
six of the top nine jobs at the State
Department are currently empty this is
not normal and I keep going back to this
point the real tragedy of the Trump
debacle is that it has made ignorant
popular again okay it's put a ton of
energy behind those who defend lack of
knowledge and lack of intellectual
curiosity and it goes way beyond the
micro of Ivanka sitting there as
Secretary of State or Trump paying a
porn star off or Trump being the puppet
of a foreign government we can undo a
lot of the damage that Trump does some
of it we won't be able to undo but it's
going to take a long time to recover
from the broader idea that speaking like
Trump doing diplomacy or not doing it
the way the Trump administration is
doing it the pseudo intellectualism and
anti intellectualism that I've been
talking about
for a while now that has lasting damage
just look at education around the world
look at math and science scores from
other countries compared to the United
States that is going to be in my mind
the most long term destructive impact of
the trump administration and I I don't
exactly know how we're going to recover
from it I'm out of time no voicemail
today it was gonna be a good one it
really was but I'll get to it tomorrow
fantastic bonus show coming up for you
today as well if you ever watch Fox News
and who could blame you if you don't you
might be familiar with the face or name
of retired lieutenant colonel ralph
peters a longtime Fox News contributor
on the network
he has quit in shame self-described
shame saying he's ashamed of the
network's coverage and he emailed his
colleagues and that email has been
obtained by BuzzFeed and if his name
rings a bell and you don't watch Fox
News it might be because this is the
same guy who was suspended by Fox News
in 2015 for calling President Obama a
quote total we covered it at the
time during an appearance on the Fox
Business Network
I've excerpted just the relevant parts
of Ralph Peters email to his colleagues
explaining why he's going to be quitting
Fox News where he said quote I feel
compelled to explain why I have to leave
I swore to support and defend the
Constitution and that oath did not
expire when I took off my uniform today
I feel that Fox News is assaulting our
constitutional order and the rule of law
while fostering corrosive and
unjustified paranoia among viewers over
my decade with Fox I long was proud of
the Association now I am ashamed
Fox is degenerated from providing a
legitimate and much-needed outlet for
conservative voices to a mere propaganda
machine for a destructive and ethically
ruinous administration when primetime
hosts who have never served our country
in any capacity dismiss facts and
empirical reality to launch profoundly
dishonest attacks on the FBI the Justice
Department's the court the courts the
intelligence community in which I served
and not least a model public servant and
genuine war hero such as Robert Muller
all the while
our mongering with lurid warnings of
deep state matcha nations machinations I
cannot be part of the same organization
Fox News is now wittingly harming our
system of government for profit going on
to say as a Russia analyst for many
years it also has appalled me that hosts
who made their reputations as super
patriots and who justifiably savaged
President Obama first duplicitous faulty
with Putin now advanced Putin's agenda
by making light of Russian penetration
of our elections and the Trump campaign
and by the way as an intelligence
professional I can tell you that the
steel dossier rings true that's how the
Russians do things the result is that we
have an American president who is
terrified of his counterpart in Moscow
Fox News has crossed the line
for the guy who called Obama a total
 right this is a real hardcore
ideologically committed right winger and
he is calling out Fox's propaganda and
calling out Trump as being Putin's
puppet and all of a sudden he goes in
the eyes of the Fox News audience from
conservative hero to unpatriotic stooge
as far as they're concerned and I want
to be super clear here Ralph Peters is
no hero he is not even an admirable
person he has a long long track record
of the most horrifying and disgusting
views and statements he is truly a
raging clown but even he sees what it is
that's going on at Fox and he talks
about his decade with Fox News during
that decade Fox News was going after
Obama for his choice of mustard right
and Peters apparently felt okay staying
then so I'm not making this guy appear
to be a good guy in any way pat but what
I am Telling You is that someone as
heinous in their views as this guy even
sees what's going on judging by that
statement he wants a virtue bestowed on
him for making this decision annually
treated like a hero but yet he was
complicit for that 10-year period yeah
but on the other hand I think Fox News
has gotten worse I agree from
administration began no it's been and
you know what I don't think it's that
Fox News has necessarily gotten worse
it's just that at this point it's even
harder to pretend like we don't see
what's going on like when Bush was
president and they were all talking
constantly about just how great he is
and how great everything is it was at
least a more coherent narrative in terms
of how the sort of ideologically
committed right winger would buy into it
but now it's getting even hard for the
ideologically committed right-wingers to
just pretend that the Fox narrative is
the accurate one and listen he made the
right decision albeit ten years too late
right and now Fox News is going after
the intelligence community and he said
that he served the intelligence
community yeah so he's saying oh now
it's like you're attacking me it feels
personal now yeah let's not pretend that
this is anything but a guy who has been
totally complacent and complicit in the
garbage from Fox News who just sort of
feels like he's been pushed over the
edge maybe partially because he feels
personally attacked by the narrative
from Fox News about the Intel community
right decision glad to see him go
not a hero should have done it a decade
ago so we already know that adult film
actress stormy Daniels was paid a
hundred and thirty thousand bucks in
hush money she also signed a
nondisclosure agreement for an alleged
affair with Donald Trump that took place
as far as we knew before Trump was
President of the United States right
when Trump was a private citizen and
that's something that his defenders have
been focusing on this is stuff that
Trump allegedly did while he was a
private citizen but now we're hearing
more from stormy Daniels lawyer Michael
avenatti who appeared in a number of CNN
interviews recently one with Jake Tapper
and he's now alleging a lot of different
stuff none all of which individually
would be totally blockbuster the first
allegation being that some of these
incidents between stormy Daniels and
President Donald Trump took place while
Donald Trump was president which now is
painting a drastically different
scenario in situation
here's clip number one obviously a big
debate about how relevant an
extramarital affair when Donald Trump
was a private citizen and alleged
extramarital affair is to the job he's
doing right now is there anything in the
litany of accusations you would call
them facts that surround this case that
happened while Donald Trump was
president yes
can you go any further than that no and
to those who say hey this is just an
alleged affair back when Donald Trump
was a private citizen who cares
you would say it's all about the
cover-up
all right Michael avenatti thank you so
much for your time appreciate the other
picked big piece of news from stormy
Daniels attorney is that she was
physically threatened to not talk about
what she knew that's what Michael
avenatti said to CNN's Chris Cuomo let's
look at that clip
what are you alleging was done to your
client in terms of pressure to stay
quiet well I'm not alleging anything I'm
stating a fact and the fact is that my
client was physically threatened to stay
silent about what she knew about Donald
Trump the details surrounding that she's
going to discuss I'm sure on the 60
Minutes interview on March 25 and the
American people are going to weigh her
veracity and the third piece of alleged
news is that there are six more women
with similar stories about Donald Trump
although avenatti says he's not yet
vetted those stories in total this one's
with Anderson Cooper do you find the
stories of these other women who you say
have come to you are credible or are
there any similarities in terms of
circumstances
good evening Anderson as of tonight
we've been approached by six separate
women with similar stories to my client
I want to stress that we have not vetted
these stories to any great degree
however the the initial consultations
the initial information that we're
receiving indicates that there are some
striking similarities between their
stories and that of my client miss
Clifford can you say if any of these
women have non-disclosure agreements yes
they do at least two of them can you say
can you say is it from the same LLC that
Michael Cohen set up before for the one
with stormy Daniels we don't know yet
Wow there's lots of little facts that
start to make more sense when you hear
this stuff like for example months ago
reported to you the white house is no
longer releasing visitor logs all right
we figured probably has to do with
lobbyists hiding the fact that the
swamps not really being drained maybe it
did
maybe it had to do with this that there
were people visiting Trump at the White
House that they didn't want to be
publicly known it's almost impossible at
this point to keep track of all the
little details but what I think is clear
is that listen stormy Daniels played a
very small role in this administration
yes she was at the White House yes she
was involved in debriefing the president
but it's not the same type of debriefing
that Steven Bannon was doing when we
said he would debrief the president
I get the sense that attorney Michael
avenatti
is doing a really good job here of
letting Trump and his attorney Michael
Cohen dig their own graves but who does
this avenatti guy think he is he
probably went to some loser fake news
school where they teach all sorts of oh
wait a vinod he went to University of
Pennsylvania same astronomy well listen
he didn't go to Wharton that's the one
I'm joined today by Bill pres he's
hosted the bill press show author of the
new book from the left a life in the
crossfire bill the book is super
interesting I think a lot of people
might be surprised or at least if not
surprised interested in your upbringing
I mean your early life was won pretty
heavily steeped in the Catholic Church
right I think a lot of people probably
don't know that how was your family
Catholic growing up my family was
Catholic my mother was a Protestant but
my father was Catherine my grandmother
was a Catholic and you know one of the
rules in those days was you're married
and I'm Catholic
the kids still had to be raised ethics
and so we were I mean church every
Sunday altar boy Catholic boys high
school and that was very very much a
part of our family so much so that when
I graduated from high school I even
thought at the time I had a vocation for
the priesthood and I I joined the
seminary and spent a solid 10 years of
my life studying for the priesthood and
you I mean not only was your family not
only were you raised Catholic but your
family was was pretty conservative how
did your politics end up so different
you know you're right I grew up it was a
small town in Delaware Delaware City all
of my family were Republicans I if I had
stayed there I think I'd be a trump
voter today right god forbid but I
always say I became a Democrat because
my parents were Republicans I think I
sort of rebelled even at that time
against what I was supposed to think and
how I was supposed to act but I I also
very early on sort of got the sense that
which I still believe that the
Democratic Party was the party
that was on the side of the little guy
in the middle class and not the
Republican Party and as you moved away
politically from where your family was
but
do you still consider yourself Catholic
religious or did that change as well
politically a long way and I'm sure
we'll get more into that no I would
still say first of all III don't go to I
don't go to church anymore I find
organized religion not part of my life
and even skeptical about any organized
religion I still think I maintain a
basic set of faith values from those
days that I try to live by and I try to
make decisions following I'm the great
Tim Russert once called me a sermon on
the mount Catholic and I kind of wire
that wear that as a badge of honor so I
try to live up to those principles but
to me that doesn't include the necessity
of showing up every Sunday morning in a
Catholic Church
what anything come sort of in total
Americans have been moving away from not
only religion as sort of church
membership but also from religious
belief what do you think is driving that
well I think a certain amount of it is
materialism frankly it is consumerism
there is that I also think it's more and
more and certainly in my case that
people find organized religion or the
path that they're delivered on a regular
basis on a Sunday in sermons or some of
the dictates of organized religion to be
not relevant anymore
not helpful and maybe even contradictory
particularly I think that's true of
Millennials huh that's reasoning so I
mean you would you say that consumerism
is more responsible for pulling people
out or pushing them out of religion more
so than something like scientific
knowledge is advanced the advance of
scientific knowledge I should have added
scientific knowledge as part of that I
guess maybe I didn't because I just kind
of take it for granted
but you're definitely right in there you
know for some people it's that
skepticism or refusal to accept science
that has kept them in there particularly
evangelicals right in in their lockstep
version of Christianity I think those
are those are all factors and I think
particularly when young people today you
know they hear somebody say oh you know
transgender is wrong or LGBTQ is wrong
right or a woman has no control of her
own body I mean they just they're just
not willing to accept that the way
people once did from that authority
figure that happened to be standing in
the pulpit let's talk a little bit about
the 2016 election and what's going on
now you supported Bernie Sanders for the
nomination in 2016 as did I you also at
one point were the chair of the
California Democratic Party so you have
maybe different view of how the DNC the
National DNC behaved during 2016 give me
your assessment I mean what do you think
of how the DNC managed the primary in
2016 I think it was shameful the way
they managed the primary in 2016 by the
way I thought I I was chair of the
California Democratic Party David for
three years from 93 to 96 yep
and so that was some time ago but even
at that time I I fought the DNC I again
from California I just thought it was
Washington trying to dictate everything
a cookie cutter approach in every state
I really thought the fact that Iowa and
New Hampshire were first in every every
year you know every four years when what
they really do not represent the
American people so little diversity and
so I was always sort of a never trusted
the DNC but particularly in the 2016
campaign I think their behavior they
were owned lock stock and barrel by the
Clinton campaign it was a
very very unfair to Bernie Sanders or
anybody else who was trying to contest
the nomination
the DNC had a deal with Hillary where
they were in the primary when they
should have been totally neutral and let
me back up as state chair of California
you're in one of our rules was we never
took a position in the primary right we
let the Democrats Democratic voters
decide who their candidate was going to
be in 2016 the DNC decided they were
going to coronate Hillary they made a
deal with her without anybody else's
knowledge to raise money during the
primary and part of that money went to
the DNC but part of it went right to the
Hillary Clinton campaign as we know they
only scheduled what was it
twelve ten or twelve debates at the
worst possible times on the worst
possible nights to protect Hillary and
to save her from and god forbid she
could hold her own but they sort of felt
that they had to protect her from
debating Bernie or Martin O'Malley or
whatever uh and then with the
super-delegates that she had there were
over 400 DNC super-delegates who pledged
for Hillary Clinton support her at the
convention vote for the event before she
had even declared as president so it was
totally outrageous and we only found out
about we by the way Bernie said that I
said it I believed it we only found out
the evidence when the russians hacked
into the DNC emails John Podesta Z mails
do you so I've said before and I wonder
if you agree I don't necessarily think I
mean certainly this what the DNC did for
me is not a legal issue and even not
being an unbiased arbiter of the primary
is not objectively wrong to me as long
as you're transparent about it the
problem I have is posturing as an
unbiased arbiter of the primary and not
being one if everybody knew the DNC
picks someone early on if we all know
that that's a different story what do
you think absolutely and by the way
debbie Wasserman Schultz who was the
chair at the time well I mean she lived
she said that they were not they
not tilted toward Hillary but they did
and you're right Dave it's not illegal
what they did
I think it's undemocratic I took wrong
you know the whole Iowa I said at the
time that the Republican Party operated
more as a democracy in the primary than
the Democratic Party did in terms of the
process right they don't have very few
super-delegates and they have to follow
what the states how this notice of the
states go so yeah the DNC just lied to
the American people and to the
Democratic Party pretending to be
neutral when in fact they were just an
arm of the Clinton campaign
you mentioned Russia and I'm very
curious myself as someone who supported
Bernie Sanders in the primary but
believes what the evidence seems to be
pointing to when it comes to Russia I
have some concern about a contingent of
Bernie supporters who seem to be
rejecting everything we learn about
Russia because they feel in some way it
devalues Bernie's strength and props up
or makes Hillary seem like a better
candidate I think the idea being were it
not for Russia
maybe Hillary would have won which I
think were so far beyond at this point
can you give me an assessment as a
Bernie supporter of sort of what where
you see the Russia investigation at this
point
well first of all I think I don't know I
don't know any Bernie people who believe
that if they do they're dead before we
do some emails afterwards yeah okay but
you know what if they do they're dead
wrong they are as wrong as Donald Trump
is when he refuses to accept the fact of
absolute certain Russian attempts to
interfere in this election because he's
it devalues his election right and so
that's why that's why he's so much
against his mother and investigation he
again he thinks it undermines his win
look I'll tell you where I think the
Russian investigation is right now and I
think this is where Donald Trump is
totally clueless this is real it is
serious
it's a criminal investigation on the
part of this administers apartment on
the President of the United States he is
being investigated for at least two
things possible collusion with the
Russians we don't know for sure yet and
possible obstruction obstruction of
justice which i think is pretty evident
in the firing of James Comey and now
maybe the firing of the Andy McCabe and
the other thing we know is Mulder is a
serious man he is he's got a an
incredibly gifted team of prosecutors
and experienced team of prosecutors with
him and this investigation no matter
what what Donald Trump says is going to
end when robert muller says it's over
when he finishes his investigation and
then we'll see his final report it's not
going to end before unless Donald Trump
were to fire robert muller or try to
have him fired which i think would be
that as Lindsey Graham said a
constitutional crisis yeah I don't
disagree in the last couple of minutes
we have I'm curious about you know as a
talk radio veteran we've seen for a very
long period of time that the right does
better on broadcast talk radio not
talking about on line not talking about
any platform but broadcast talk radio I
have some ideas as to why that is what
what do you think has led to this
longtime domination of the talk radio
airwaves by the right you're kind enough
to mention my latest book which is from
the left life in the crossfire I
actually wrote an earlier book called
toxic Park where a few years ago where I
looked at this I think there's several
factors and you and I have both
struggled against them right I should
say you and I both survived and thrived
right back right one is the medium of
talk radio lit two angry old angry white
men who get their fix and that's all
they want and they're replenished by
that we're those of us progressives I
think are more open-minded I like to
hear different points of view and
swiffer us you know switch around the
dial try different people the red
Republicans never do that
secondly ownership ownership ownership
yep Serbs were very smart they went out
they bought up the networks they bought
up the stations they recruited talent
they trained the talent they put their
money into that talent and they kept
progressives off the air on many many
terrestrial stations the numbers are
overwhelming at one time there were 2000
news talk stations in the country and
maximum a hundred progressive talk radio
stations so you can't compete if they
won't let you on the air and the owners
won't let progressive voices on the air
so it's it's online and it's the
internet and it's free speech TV where I
think we are really still able to make a
difference and have our voices be heard
yeah I would I would even add to that
that structurally some right-wing
arguments on issues just lend themselves
to 30 60 and 120 second sound bites
right all abortion is murder that's
super simple the position on the Left
isn't just the opposite it's well it's
more complicated than that and you have
to sort of determine up to which point
in a Preda right the by their very
structure some of these right-wing
positions are just better for talk radio
yeah absolutely
or that Barack Obama's gonna take away
all your guns sure okay so then you get
into what is sensible gun safety
measures and you know you lose the the
extremists if you will the book is from
the left a life in the crossfire we've
been speaking with the book's author and
host of the bill press show bill press
thank you so much for talking to me
today
hey David great to join you I'm a big
fan thank you appreciate it
welcome welcome
a lot of big news a lot of stuff to talk
about even just since we finished the
show a few hours ago already sort of
like four major breaking stories I'll be
talking about all of them Donald Trump
has fired his national security adviser
HR McMaster Donald Trump restates that
he wants to testify or speak to rather
Robert Moeller Donald Trump's primary
personal attorney on the Trump Russia
investigation call it scandal whatever
has resigned and another I don't even
know what what term to use former
girlfriend a fair mistress of Donald
Trump's asserts that Donald Trump after
they had sexual relations tried to pay
her which sounds very very awkward and
we will be looking at all of those
stories in detail I now have the ability
which people seem to like last time to
actually show you the articles I'm
looking at as I discussed them people
seem to like that during the last
livestream so that's something that will
be going on we also will what else
should I do I guess I should just do
some very very brief livestream stuff
these this is a live stream this is
different from the broadcast show from
the studio and that it is actually alive
you can comment you can talk to me you
can ask questions etc etc you can use
super chat or scream labs comm slash the
david pakman show to ask questions and
send comments both are completely
acceptable methods of sending questions
and comments and I will read them if
it's a question I will answer it if it's
a comment I guess I'll react to it to
the extent that there's anything to
react to and then as always as I make a
habit of doing any new members and
patrons who sign up during the live
stream either at patreon.com slash david
pakman show or david pakman.com slash
membership I will thank you during the
stream and
we do accept cryptocurrency you can read
about that on our website people loving
that and please don't troll the live
chat I love this thing that happens in
the live chat where someone will like
paste a swastika or so or call me a Jew
 and with in before I can even react
they've already been banned by one of
our moderators so they're our moderators
the moderators moderators have been
completely deputized and empowered to
get rid of people as they see fit based
on my guidelines and the guidelines are
what are the guidelines I think it's you
know it when you see it obvious trolling
will get you banned and less obvious
subtle trolling probably won't because
it's so subtle that we won't even notice
what it is that you are doing so let's
get right into Story number one why
don't we which is that Donald Trump now
is saying that he wants to testify in
Robert Muller's Russia investigation
let's take a look at this article from
the hill hopefully ten ads won't pop up
while I'm talking Trump said today he
wants to testify before special counsel
Robert Muller
yes I would like to he said this
happened after John Dowd resigned so I
think that there's actually some PR
value to this because the resignation of
John Dowd combined with the hiring
retaining the retention of a new lawyer
for Trump who has seen more as a type of
guy de Genovese his last name I forget
his first name who would try to push
Trump to fire Muller
this may be a way to indirectly say
listen if I was gonna fire molar and if
dad's resignation was an indication that
that's the direction I was going I
wouldn't be saying I want to testify but
that is the wrong analysis that assumes
that trumps motivation is not to alarm
people with the idea that he's going to
fire Muller I think a more likely
explanation is Trump does want to fire
Muller whether he ultimately will or
won't remains to be seen but the idea of
saying he wants to testify is so later
when he has fired Muller and people say
you clearly had it out for him from the
beginning Trump can say now
I'm on record March 22nd I said I want
to testify for Robert Muller and I meant
it why would I say that if I was just
planning to fire the guy I fired him
because he did something worthy of
firing so I think that's probably the
logic here as the article states Trump
and Dowd found themselves at odds over
how to handle the Russia probe and one
of their disputes was regarding a
potential Trump interview with Muller
president has publicly and privately
said he should sit down with the special
counsel while Dowd advised against it
Trump has long expressed the belief that
he should be able to deliver his
argument personally Tamala that his
campaign did not collude with Moscow's
election meddling efforts so this I mean
if that's if that's an accurate report
that just sort of shows the naivete I
guess I would say of Donald Trump where
Trump thinks that it's all going to be
did you collude with Russia did you
deliberately coordinate with them and
that that's going to be the focus but
the way that these interviews are going
to go and this is why I think Trump's
lawyers to the extent that they were
saying this are making the right move by
saying no no no don't go in and talk to
Muller because Trump's gonna go in there
and the questions aren't going to be mr.
Trump mr. president did you collude no
the questions are going to be super
specific about what Trump knew when
whether he had awareness of X Y or Z and
those are mostly going to be questions
that Muller's team already knows the
answers to because that's how these
investigators work so Trump's naivete
and thinking he'll just go in there and
swear up and down just like he
bamboozles and bullies people in his
business dealings he'll go in there and
just tell Mulder now there's there's no
collusion and Mulder will say oh you
know what I didn't see it that way
I guess you're right shouldn't really
worry about it that's the Trump naivete
as the article indicates some Trump
attorneys and outside legal experts
warned the president could expose
himself to tremendous legal risks if he
makes false statements during an
interview with Muller or his team of
investigators
Muller is also probing whether Trump
obstructed justice in his investigation
into Russian meddling his team
reportedly sent a list of questions to
Trump's lawyers that may come up in a
possible interview I actually I'm
against that
I think that's that's not a good idea I
think it's sort of what I do when we do
interviews and guests ask me for
questions and I say no I'm not I'm not
gonna give you the questions
but I'll let you know what the topics
are going to be I think that that would
have been a better approach but it might
might be something that molars team saw
is necessary the special can this is a
very interesting paragraph the special
counsels office is said to be focused on
the president's role in drafting a
misleading statement about Donald Trump
juniors meeting with a Russian lawyer at
Trump Tower in 2016 in June 2016 the
circumstances surrounding the meeting
and the firings of national security
adviser Michael Flynn and FBI director
James Comey yeah that's an interesting
note because it's long been suggested
that that is a direct way in which Trump
both was complicit in the lies
specifically related to Russia and it
casts a lot of doubt on the possibility
that Trump just knew nothing right I
mean like it's very very hard to believe
that Trump knew that Trump went from
knowing absolutely nothing about any
meeting whatsoever to sing let me get
personally involved in drafting the
response its most logical and again it's
not evidence of anything in and of
itself but it's most logical that this
is something Trump had a sort of general
awareness of and the participation in
that was part of Trump just thinking hey
I'm better than everybody else I know
what to say let me draft it and then
it's all just gonna be fantastic and
nobody's gonna have any questions
whatsoever of course didn't work out
that way right then didn't work out that
way whatsoever okay let me see if
there's anything else here in this
article I wanted to touch on Trump has
indicated he wants a more bare knuckled
approach towards Moeller under dad's
leadership his legal team largely
cooperated the president this week added
longtime Washington lawyer Joseph
digenova
to his legal team the Geneva has argued
the Russia probe is part of an FBI plot
to frame Trump and exonerate Hillary
Clinton so Trump now has a full-blown
conspiracy theorists working for him he
got rid of the lawyer who pretty astute
Lee came to the conclusion that Trump
shouldn't talk to Moeller from the point
of view of protecting his
got rid of that guy and instead brought
on a full-blown conspiracy theorists who
even used the term witch-hunt
the Muller probe which is a term that
Trump uses the Muller probe should never
have started in that there was no
collusion and there was no crime Trump
tweeted last weekend again calling the
investigation a witch-hunt doubt issued
a statement last weekend calling for an
end to molars investigation but then
gave conflicting accounts over whether
he was speaking on behalf of Trump or
just himself so we will see whether that
happens I think the most likely scenario
is not that Trump actually has any plan
of sitting down with Muller I think the
idea here is to portray a willingness to
sit down with Muller to later use it as
a defense for saying I didn't fire molar
because I was ideologically committed to
the idea of firing him I was more than
willing to speak to him I fired him
because he did X Y or Z and who knows
what that will be okay let's see what
else by the way is my video not doing
well because I'm getting a message here
from YouTube on the stream now that I'm
looking at it which says that there's a
problem with my keyframes and that as a
result people may have to buffer often
if you're having the buffer often let me
know in the chat and I can look at
changing some settings here you good
this is depth one anybody else am i
having rights okay from what I see
you're coming in clear video looks good
looks good to me looks fine to me looks
good to me
all right well I'm just gonna proceed I
will proceed as a Barack Obama once
asked Mitt Romney to please proceed
governor okay as I mentioned I do like
to do thank-yous and shout outs to

it's a big thing it's a big thing all
the kids these days are doing it and I'm
excited to be able to tell you about it
today let me get to the next story for
today's livestream but before that I
want to get to a super chat because Troy
McCain Roy has sent a five Canadian
dollar super chat asking kind of
off-topic but have you ever been noticed
in public I have it happens pretty often
it probably happens I don't know maybe
maybe three times a month or something
like that it recently happened actually
getting on to the subway at the Downtown
Crossing stop here in Boston and as I
was walking by there was a actual subway
attendant we call it the T here in
Boston who said hey I said yeah I
figured there was something wrong with
my cart or he thought I was trying to
jump the turnstile and he said you look
exactly the same as you look on TV and I
said thank you
and and moved on cuz it is a little bit
awkward it's a little bit awkward every
time it happens but I do what I can with
it you know I can't can't always be
prepared with the right response
sometimes it's just a little bit awkward
okay I have already talked to you about
how Donald Trump says he wants to
testify before Robert Moeller now we are
going to get to the second big story
from today the story from earlier today
that Donald Trump stopped Russia lawyer
John
Daud resigned today very good Washington
Post article outlining the entire thing
and as it says president Trump whose top
attorney handling the Russia probe
resigned Thursday is struggling to find
top-notch defense lawyers willing to
represent him in the case according to
multiple Trump advisors familiar with
negotiations I love that because it's a
super subtle attack on Joseph digenova
Trump recently brought on a conspiracy
theorist lawyer Joseph digenova
who believes that actually the FBI is
trying to improve the public's image of
Hillary Clinton by even doing a trump
Russia investigation I love how by
saying that it's tough for Trump to find
top notch defense lawyers it's sort of
an indirect attack on digenova because
you just hired the genival but nobody
thinks he's exactly a top notch guy and
as we've covered before as the article
says some law firms have signaled that
they do not want the controversy of
representing a divisive and unpopular
president while others have told Trump
advisers they have clients with
conflicting interests there's another
problem here because prior attorneys
have said they don't want to work for
Trump because number one they don't
think he'll listen to them and number
two they're not sure that he'll pay them
so that act those are actually pretty
solid reasons not to represent somebody
and the what does this comment seems
unrelated comment from Japan about
national crises doubt has been the
president's main point of contact with
Muller's office which is investigating
Russian interference we know that Dowd
also had been negotiating the terms for
the president to sit for an interview
with Moeller's team as it examines
whether Trump has obstructed justice by
seeking to shut down the investigation
this is ultimately going to explode one
way or the other
and there are any number of different
ways that this could ultimately explode
but the way in which it explodes is sort
of going to be determined by Trump and
what I mean by that is that a lot of
what's even going on with Trump Russia
is self inflicted by Donald Trump if we
all just for a second take a step back
from the daily news of the Trump Russia
investigate
where it's one issue building on another
one building on another one and another
one Thanks step one by the way I'll get
to your super chat in a moment if from
the very beginning right go back all the
way to the beginning at this point if
from the beginning Trump had not tweeted
anything about Trump Russia not fired
anyone to try to obstruct an
investigation and simply when asked from
the beginning said only I respect the
FBI
I plan to cooperate fully I am going to
focus on pursuing the agenda I outlined
during my campaign while they do this
investigation I look forward to being
vindicated and cleared and being able to
move on beyond this and that's it it is
very difficult to imagine that the
investigation would have gotten to the
point that it is now and it's also
difficult to imagine that it would have
gotten as close to Trump as it is now
there is probably no way at this point
to really believe that there would have
been no investigation at all at least
into trump campaign associates because
even without Trump's statements there's
a lot of really sketchy stuff that
appears to have gone on but without
Trump calling even more attention to
himself and creating whole new lines of
inquiry about possible obstruction of
justice based on firings and so on and
so forth the degree to which this would
be hitting Trump would be a fraction of
what it is right now so I think that
mostly to blame here is Donald Trump
even if you believe that he was sort of
the pans the the Patsy or the the puppet
in the entire Russia thing that he
really wasn't directly involved he was
more the stooge who was being
manipulated it was some of his aides
that were more directly involved he
still has inflicted this upon himself by
the firings and the tweets and the
attacks and the war against the
intelligence community okay let's talk
now about oh let me get to these other
super chats DEP One has sent the $20
super chat saying you demand keep the
show keep the show going homie well I
planned you I plan to you though show
show is alive and well and it's going to
continue I think we also got oh
for stream labs.com slash the david
pakman show which is another way that
you can ask questions and make comments
- from Christina to dollar stream lapse
contributions from Christina David I've
missed you do you enjoy scented candles
I don't I hate scent scented candles and
in fact I recently threw some out that
were given to me as a gift because I
just can't stand the smell and I think I
might be almost mildly allergic to that
I just find it very very agitating and I
want nothing to do there will be no
scented candles here in my place to the
extent that I have a say alright so I
think we're more or less done I don't
know there's much else I want to say
about this Trump lawyer article oh this
is this is sort of relevant and I've
read a couple commentaries about this
Trump has this other lawyer named Ty
Cobb which is just kind of funny because
Ty Cobb was a very famous baseball
player and if you see the guy's mustache
it's also pretty funny Ty Cobb if Ty
Cobb is still there if Ty Cobb goes that
would really be a signal that Trump is
becoming more sort of I I guess I would
say committed to a more risque approach
when it comes to Trump Russia and Muller
and the entire thing because again Ty
Cobb has sort of been not that he's the
most reasonable guy but sort of a
moderating influence on Trump as well
okay nothing else to say there the next
big story is that Donald Trump has
indeed fired his national security
adviser HR McMaster now this would be
news already if this were only Trump's
first national security adviser but this
is already Trump's second national
security adviser remember the first one
Michael Flynn has already been indicted
and could really be facing some pretty
serious prison time I mean he has very
very serious charges against the middle
I I think come down mostly to what kind
of a deal he ultimately strikes with
prosecutors and with Robert Moeller's
team now Trump Trump had previously
replaced Flynn with HR McMaster a
[Music]
the david pakman show at david
pakman.com I know that what I'm about to
ask you to do is sort of difficult to do
because it's exploding in our faces
every single day but imagine just for a
second if you can and this will be easy
for some people in our audience that
there were no Russia story right imagine
that there were no investigations into
Donald Trump no indictment no attempt to
obstruct the investigation by firing all
sorts of people put the entire thing
aside for a moment which again I think a
lot of people in our audience will
actually not have trouble doing but some
of you will we've now learned about a
completely separate Trump campaign
scandal which has exploded in the last
24 hours because of a really really good
investigation published by Britain's
channel 4 and the company in question
here is Cambridge analytic
that's not Cambridge Massachusetts right
near our studio but that's Cambridge UK
and they also play a role in today's
major breaking story about Facebook
which we'll get to later on in the
program
Cambridge analytic O'Call z' themselves
a big data behavioural micro targeting
political campaign support firm at least
that's what they call themselves on
Twitter and what they do it turns out is
a combination of opposition research and
social media targeting along with we
have now learned blackmail scams bribes
the hiring of prostitutes to set up
honey traps as well as perpetuating fake
news the Channel 4 documentary which you
should absolutely watch first part is
out about 20 minutes I believe a second
part is upcoming the documentary exposes
their techniques and it goes all the way
up to the top and when I say all the way
up to the top I don't mean close to the
top or near the top I mean to the
absolute
and what channel four did is create an
undercover investigation where they had
a an individual posing as a sri lankan
who was working with a family in Sri
Lanka and the family had aspirations for
political office in Sri Lanka and what
they wanted to meet with Cambridge
analytic to do was to sort of interview
Cambridge analytical to see if we want
to run if our family member wants to run
for elected office in Sri Lanka could
you help us what would you be able to do
in order to help us and after just a
couple of initial meetings the fake
possible client which was really an
undercover investigator working with
Channel four ends up meeting with none
other than the head of Cambridge
analytic a Alexander Nicks and Alexander
Nicks is a guy who is a public figure he
has spoken at conferences all around the
world about just the amazing and great
things that Cambridge analytic it does
and he gets caught on hidden camera in
this channel for investigation talking
about how his firm has lots of
experience bringing in prostitutes to
set up politicians he specifically
suggests the idea of Ukrainian
prostitutes as a possible as possible
agents of help with this Sri Lankan
campaign he talks about what Cambridge
analytic AHA's done how they are experts
in this stuff his co-conspirator in the
image we're showing our television
audience now sitting to Nyx's right
talking about how they are masters of
disguise in doing this type of thing and
this is yet another story that connects
directly to the Oval Office and to Jared
Kushner and to Steven Bannon who at one
point was a part owner of Cambridge
analytic a stake holder in Cambridge
analytic ah this company was Donald
Trump's campaign consultants for 2016
and this raises a whole new and separate
specter of suspicion on Donald Trump's
campaign so now if you want you can
totally disregard the Russia story not
that it's going away I just mean if
you're thinking about how Trump won you
can temporarily put aside all of the
Russia
and now we have to explore whether
Donald Trump won at least in part
because of the actions of a firm that
uses prostitutes and blackmail and
entrapment and bribe so here's how this
is going to go it's already happening to
some degree Cambridge analytic I will
deny using these tactics in their work
for Trump
they'll also deny it more broadly but
I'll get to that in a second
Trump and his team will say listen we
did some work with Cambridge analytic it
was very minor it was just social media
targeting and that's it we will all be
incredibly skeptical and hopefully
investigative journalists will start
digging into the detail about exactly
which tactics Cambridge analytic I did
use to help Donald Trump in his 2016
campaign and it might come out that yeah
Cambridge analytic I merely did some
Facebook targeting for Trump with some
of that data that they got from Facebook
which we'll talk about later today it
might come out that Cambridge analytic
Adhan 'old Trump but what is without
question is that this is one of the
biggest corporate embarrassments in a
long time and it's clear that Cambridge
analytic is clueless about how to
respond to this because their top people
are on video admitting to this stuff
watch the 19 or 20 minute documentary
and you will see Alexander Knicks and
Turnbull mark Turnbull or I forget his
first name Turnbull who is the the co
partner there the other partner talking
about all the things they have done and
can do and would suggest doing so let's
now go through some of the responses and
defenses from Cambridge analytic ah
which are just the best I'm I'm
relishing truly seeing this stuff first
this one's sort of minor the official
Twitter account for Cambridge analytic
sent out a tweet about the Channel 4
documentary where they said tonight's
Channel 4 News story gives a highly
misleading picture of the company and
what we do yeah it's misleading because
not only do they hire prostitutes for
honey traps and create blackmail videos
they'll also give you advice about how
to run Google ads so yeah that wasn't
really made a big part of the Channel 4
investigation should have been included
in the interest of full disclosure
next Cambridge analytic a floats the
idea that it was all a joke about hiring
prostitutes that the mention of the
hiring prostitutes was a way to figure
out whether their potential sri lankan
client had bad intentions they were
trying to see is the sri lankan client
immoral because we would never do any of
this stuff we were trying to suss it out
here's a quote from the statement that
Cambridge analytic about that this is
just have the barf bags nearby please
they said despite this clear statement
the undercover reporter later attempted
to entrap it's all projection Cambridge
analytic entraps and now they're saying
someone else tried to entrap them
attempted to entrap Cambridge analytic
executives by initiating a conversation
about unethical practices after several
meetings discussing ostensibly
legitimate projects the reporter
unexpectedly and suddenly turned the
conversation towards practices such as
corruption and the entrapment of
political figures assessing the legality
and reputational risks associated with
new projects is critical for us and we
routinely undertake conversations with
prospective clients to try to tease out
any unethical or illegal intentions that
is just the best and then they go on to
say the to Cambridge analytic executives
at the meeting humored these questions
and actively encourage the prospective
client to disclose his intentions it's
just a lie I mean if you watch the 20
minute documentary you will see that the
questions from the undercover reporter
are so general like can you tell me
about the type of opposition research
that you do and the CA people the
Cambridge analytical people volunteer
there's opposition research but there's
more than opposition research they
volunteer all of the stuff and the idea
that they were merely trying to suss out
and were humoring and testing out the
undercover reporter is ridiculous and
case in point within just a few meetings
they bring along their top guy Alexander
Nix the head of the company Cambridge
analytical reportedly has according to
crunch base between 100 and 250
employees
when they suspect the client of maybe
pulling their leg or having bad
intentions they send in their CEO the
top guy to meet directly with this
person who on earth would believe this
explanation and the bigger concern is
not mean listen these people are
horrible right this is this is not
democracy this is a perversion of the
democratic system and the big picture
here is that it connects directly to
Trump and right-wing media is ignoring
that connection it connects to Steven
Bannon because he held a stake he was
part owner in Cambridge analytic until
he started working for the Trump
Organization a trumpet campaign Trump
administration and sold his stake in cà
although very very late and according to
reports it also appears that it was
Jared Kushner who wanted to hire this
firm in the first place and it just so
happens that Kushner's family has a
history of entrapping people with sex
jared krishna's father Charles Kushner
hired a prostitute
to sleep with his sister's husband and
then used it as leverage against him and
it just so happens that Jared Kushner
wants to hire a company that we now know
engages in similar practices this is a
whole new scandal right it is a whole
new scandal in the Trump administration
right-wing media is going way out of its
way to keep this out of the headlines
check this out from this morning I just
said let's just see what's going on in
different right-wing news websites
Drudge Report you go there Jared and the
prince
you see stories about just about
everything other than this major major
story go to Fox news.com
what do you see another blast rocks
Texas not that that's not a story we're
gonna be talking about that story
tomorrow and all sorts of other stuff
but not this you go to Ben Shapiro's
right-wing news website daily wire
package which shrapnel explodes a Texas
FedEx facility will Germany block Israel
from finally getting a seat on the UN
progressive groups looking to organize
march in support of louis farrakhan
palestinian terrorist murder three young
jews Abbas silent but nothing about this
major major story and I could go on with
other examples it's like it just doesn't
exist
and this is ultimately the problem
because of the filter bubbles and the
echo chambers and the algorithms tons of
people will never hear about this or by
the time they do they'll inherently
assume if I haven't heard about this
until now it must not really be a big
story that is one of the biggest
problems here that this putting aside
everything else that's going on in
connection with the Trump administration
right now this is a major new scandal
and so many people will never hear about
it and if they do it'll be half-baked
harebrained attempt to debunk the entire
story but there's no debunking and the
flaccid attempts from Cambridge
analytical to say oh it's all misleading
and we were just testing them if we were
just joking about all the stuff it's BS
and I hope somehow it gets through to
the committed trumpet although quite
frankly I'm not super optimistic about
that send me your thoughts about this
story or any other from today I'm on

show we are in the throes of one of the
biggest tech privacy scandals in a very
long time it's now apparent that the
data analytics firm cambridge analytical
which worked for the Trump campaign we
learned over the last 24 hours based on
a channel 4 report that they engage in
everything from the hiring of
prostitutes to blackmail setups and
entrapment in order to work for their
clients Cambridge analytic working for
the Trump campaign in the most recent
presidential election inappropriately
gained access to the data of 50 million
Facebook users the data of those 50
million users ended up in the hands of
Cambridge analytic and according to some
reports has not been deleted
Cambridge analytic says that they don't
have the data it's unclear Facebook
saying we've asked them to delete it but
they haven't and a completely different
story being told by CA when I heard that
please delete it reminds me of when
Hillary went to Wall Street and told
them hey you've got to cut it out right
I'm sure they'll get right on deleting
that incredibly valuable data about 50
million Facebook users and the details
of this are somewhat complex they
involve a particular app made by a
University of Cambridge lecturer called
this is your digital life all one word
note no spaces this is your digital life
the app launched in 2014 and the app
through an entity called global science
research 2
users to a survey these surveys are
common online and the survey paid them a
dollar or two and as most of these apps
do it requested access to Facebook user
information 270,000 users
went ahead and gave the app that
permission but the app was able to also
harvest information of a total of 50
million users most of whom did not give
permission like the two hundred and
seventy thousand users now this is
already bad enough but we've also
learned that the professor working on
this
Aleksander Kogan who ironically enough
might be Russian was actually working on
the behalf of strategic communication
laboratories which owns Cambridge
analytic and who was working for the
Donald Trump campaign full circle once
again Cambridge analytic ahooo is
dealing with multiple scandals at once
at this point is saying they didn't know
where the data came from that this is
all GSR and Kogan and they weren't told
exactly how they got the data and of
course if they had known how they got
the data they would have turned it down
now does anybody believe that the
company that has no problem using
prostitutes for honey traps and
blackmail and trap mint would have a
problem receiving facebook user data if
they knew where it came from having a
hard time with that
Cambridge analytic says in a statement
quote when it subsequently became clear
that the data had not been obtained by G
s are in line with Facebook's Terms of
Service Cambridge analytic deleted all
data received from GSR so that I don't
believe but the big question Cambridge
analytic aside is was Facebook complicit
and if so to what degree and the answer
is we don't know Mark Zuckerberg is now
being summoned by British officials
British elected officials the FTC
Federal Trade Commission in the United
States is starting to look into Facebook
and here's really the bottom line I hate
to break it to you and I don't think
this is going to be news to a lot of
people in our audience this is
Facebook's business model now yeah this
went further but if you listen to my
interview about a month ago six weeks
ago I don't remember exactly how long
ago with Antonio Garcia Martinez
who developed a lot of the Facebook ad
infrastructure if you read his book
chaos monkeys Facebook is fundamentally
a user data firm right it's not a social
network primarily it's not a marketer
it's not a messaging app even though it
does those things and has those features
this is a user data company and Edward
Snowden tweeted something along these
lines when the news broke saying
businesses that make money by collecting
and selling detailed records of private
lives were once plainly described as
surveillance companies they're
rebranding as social media is the most
successful deception since the
Department of War became the Department
of the defense I learned in an early
college communica munication class a
line that goes something like this if
you're not sure what the product is and
you're not paying for anything it's
probably you or another asset another
way the product is your attention what
is being bought and sold is getting your
eyeballs onto an advertisement or a
piece of content or whatever and that is
exactly what is going on here arguably
this went further and we will see to
what degree Facebook was aware of what
was going on what did happen immediately
is that Facebook's stock price dropped
when the news broke this is probably not
going to impact their bottom line
directly right advertisers advertising
with Facebook and we've advertised with
Facebook by the way are doing it because
Facebook has such great user data not
despite that reality yeah this creates a
PR problem for Facebook it's gonna make
regulators want to regulate Facebook but
it's not really a business problem until
the regulation actually hurts them for
the individual user
it's basically cost-benefit right if you
use Facebook I use Facebook Pat uses
Facebook we realize or at least I think
we would be wise to realize that our
data our preferences our likes our
friends our activity it could end up
almost anywhere is that worth it to have
Facebook and use Facebook for a lot of
people it is and there's a broader
question here
right what is the long-term impact of
companies having such accurate and
precise data about our preferences we
know that when it comes to news the
consequence of targeting at the level
that is possible is echo chambers and
algorithms that feed our biases and
increase political partisanship and that
gets me to a really important line from
Molly McHugh Molly McHugh wrote a great
article about this yesterday where she
says it doesn't matter if you don't use
your Facebook feed for politics your
Facebook feed is using you for politics
and I think that that is something we
all sort of need to be aware of here
right with products and services it's ok
well they might be able to really well
target accurately target ads so that
you'll buy stuff or sign up for services
with elections it's potentially deciding
the outcome of who our elected officials
are and thus even if you say I don't
really read news on Facebook I don't
really care about this or that I'm just
down there for the pictures or sharing
stuff with my family even if you aren't
doing politics on facebook these
algorithms are having political impact I
don't know and I wouldn't even dream of
trying to predict what is ultimately
going to happen in terms of regulation
here's something different that I think
you'll also find very interesting today
I'm speaking to Rachel stavis who's a
non-denominational Exorcist whose memoir
sister of Darkness is out and it tells
her story of Exorcist training extreme
cases and sort of what it takes to
complete an exorcism so that I'm super
interested in this and I really
appreciate you talking to me about it
how did you even find your way into
being an exorcist well when I was a kid
you know I always like other kids
complained about seeing monsters under
the bed and monsters in the closet and
then you know parents would come in
right and check and say there's nothing
there but for me it never went away
hmm so I've actually been able to see
entities with my eyes since I was a
child I didn't really want to naturally
it was really scary and I thought that
you know everybody must be doing this
until I learned very quickly you don't
talk about it so I tried to push it away
kind of have a normal life you know
become a writer do all all the normal
things and then as I got older it became
more basically impossible to block it
out anymore and at that point I had to
make a decision what am I gonna do you
know am I gonna check myself in or am I
actually going to do something with this
and that's when I decided okay there's
there's a reason right reason for
everything so there's a reason for why I
have this and it turns out it was
exorcism and as an example what what was
something you were seeing a wrecker or
that you see that caused this that sort
of catalyzed this well you know I didn't
really I wasn't able to categorize them
until I started getting older and
accepting the fact that I was looking at
this but I would see very similar things
over and over again so you know just to
just to kind of give some background you
know when people think about exorcism
and they think about entities or what
people call demons they kind of think of
the movies right where it's it's like
one specific kind of demon and they're
all kind of the same and you know you
say their name and you throw some holy
water and it's gone that's not actually
how it works there it's it's almost if
you will a species a
many different species of demons there's
lots of different ones so to make a long
story short right what I was seeing look
like monsters and there are all
different kinds of them there's probably
thousands of different kinds of entities
I probably still have yet to see them
all right but or some that are really
common which people carry very often you
know it's it's not as it's not as
uncommon to have attachment as people
believed so it's very common that the
concept of a demon is associated with
not not just religion in general but
particularly jhin's now I know you're
nondenominational but is there still is
there a religious underpinning to what
you do you know hard to say well let me
put it a different way are you like for
example are you a Christian no you're
not are you Catholic none of these
things okay nominal right but but that
doesn't mean that I don't believe and
work with high being so so let me give
you some background right on this the
way that I work is really different than
probably any other Exorcist or exorcism
thing that people have ever encountered
by a nice because yeah like I work in
energy and frequency right so if you
think about it just just on a logical
level right we are all energy we all
emit an energy every single day and the
way we do I mean we're made up of matter
which has potential energy and of course
you know we consume food and that
potential energy is converted into
kinetic energy but I don't know in what
sense are we energy well so we emit
frequency every single day that's that's
something that actually you can you can
look up you know we have energetic
frequencies that we put out into the
world in from what I work in write the
words actions we're all emitting an
energy that goes out into the world
we're carrying it with us we go through
the world a specific way and it's our
energy signature you know what we carry
and that doesn't change that much
throughout the day so if you you know
have a good day it might be a little
better you have a bad day right exactly
and this is how in other words what what
device can evaluate how that energy sort
of changes throughout the day and and in
what what's the scale of measurement
well we don't really have that
that's the issue so I I work with spirit
that's how I see it they're on it
whether believe in that or you don't is
up to you right so I work with spirit I
work with energies I can see these
energies with my eyes so therefore to be
that exists right so it depend on your
belief system right up so so in the day
when we go out and we have this it's
pretty much the same the only time that
it changes is when we have a trauma
okay when we promise X us and our energy
then dips low we have low frequency
situations that we're now emitting
that's how attachment finds us
attachment works in low frequency and
when you lo can we just define low
frequency we're talking about wave
theory and frequency is like a specific
element of wave theory are you talking
about Hertz as in sort of like an audio
wave or when you say low frequency how
is that defined so for me the way that I
see it it's almost like okay yes it's
it's like what you're saying so for me
when I look at it I can see people's how
do you define this it's not quite aura
do you know what I mean like it's so you
see the energy I'm curios you called it
low frequency which is nice something
that would be detected either orally
like a you are not oo-aah rare a you are
like in terms of sound but the low
frequency you actually see it visually I
see it visually and my my vernacular
where I get all these words i work with
spirit and that's that's the information
that i get when i hear its have given
you this sort of vocabulary that you use
right so in other word do like not
everyone agrees with calling demon
entity right is called an entity sure
you know not everybody will agree with
calling all of this spirit but like i
call it right so it's define it however
you like let's let's just put it that
way god for me it's the perspective to
just help you understand what i'm seeing
I think yeah yeah like what it is and
how I define it might be different for
other people just like people always ask
me when you see entity like the way it
shows itself to you is that how it
actually looks or is that you know
whatever and I don't have the answer for
that right
and only tell this is how this is how it
presents itself to me got it now Rachel
let me ask you this why do you believe
that you have this ability to do
exorcism and it's sort of related to my
other question which is in the Catholic
Church it's believed that Exorcist the
skill of exorcism is a skill that can be
learned on the other hand you have
people who work more in the psychic
medium side who believe that this is
just something that you are born with
and you either have or you don't is your
skill for exorcism more on the Catholic
Church learn a skill side or is it more
on the something more ethereal and and
god-given or whatever term you want to
apply to it well you know I think it's a
little bit of both if you really want to
know like I think there's a certain
amount of like why do I have it right I
don't know I was able to bring it to the
world maybe that's why I'm teaching
people you know what this is and again
like it's not listen I'm not for
everybody it's not for everybody but for
those people who want to receive that
message they get it they other words if
somebody was not sort of open to the
idea that people could be infested by
demons and that an exorcism could cure
the curator relieved that what you do
wouldn't be for them in other words not
necessarily although I do also work in
trauma and pain so you know I do take
that out of the body as well and again
think about something that I see right I
see and I feel so oh how do you define
that how do you measure that's really
hard to say I can't tell you exactly how
to do that but you know if even for
people who've come to me that don't
necessarily believe that they have
attachment or you know and I've had a
lot of skeptics come through here like
it's not for people who are like I'm
totally down for an exercise I do get a
lot of people who are like I don't
believe in this at all but somebody had
a good experience and I'm desperate so
let's try it right so it'll come to you
out of desperation in other words
they're in such a state that they'd be
willing to accept just anything that
might give any sign of improvement that
they've sort of gotten gotten to that
point and they arrived for an exorcism
and on that basis absolutely I mean if
you think about it if you just think
about it
going to an exorcist is everybody's last
resort this this is not first resort
situation right I've tried everything I
don't even know about this really with
me out but I'm gonna give it a try right
it's you know what those are my favorite
people actually to take because those
are people who come in they don't want
to tell me anything right they want to
keep it all to themselves and then
they're like let's just do this and I'm
like okay let's just do it and by the
end of it they're like in shock and in
disbelief that they feel different
really different no so that's an always
the process of the exorcism like and
without I mean we don't need to get into
the full logistics but just so our
audience has a sense of physically what
it is that happens during an exorcism
what's that like for them or for me well
what what are you doing to or around
them okay so that goes back to the
religious question right so I'm not
religious but I do work with high beings
as above so below that's the feeling
right so if we have all these low things
that we're trying to expel then we need
to call in high things to help expel
that right and so I work with high being
so high beings meaning you know spirit
guides master teachers religious figures
you know because that's still high being
all different kinds so that people feel
comfortable so if you come to me and
you're religious you know it works for
you too because that's that's something
that I can call in for you what are you
like you call in a rabbi and he kind of
blesses it like he would matzo or oh no
I mean high being like what people would
call gods with people you know what in
the end of bread angels like Archangels
things like that got it ah that's what I
call it and the way that I work is I
call them into put energy through the
body so and um if you're in a place of
low energy in the body and that's what's
causing that attachment we have to fill
you with the the high being energy to
pull that out to make that come out of
the body right they've got a full of it
yeah yeah during that process you know
we there's other things that go on like
they're you know I have shamanic tools
that work like rattles and things like
that things that agitate that energy I
use specific in senses and burns that
funds the space
and cleanse the energy is it a lavender
persimmon one of the ones you use or are
there like specific ones that are
exorcism approved no we're talking about
things like copal frankincense even
sometimes things like Blue Lotus will
Spain like the blue British yeah some of
it fairly hardcore at home yeah right so
and then how long does this thing take
or last you know it depends on the
entity like I said there are many
different kinds some are more malevolent
and more difficult to remove than others
so some people carry what I call a
trickster which is something that
creates a symbiotic relationship with
the host that's you know sometimes kids
will get that when when they're young
and it'll be something that's an
imaginary friend a genie and deceased
level on an angel yeah and oftentimes
those create you know something that
that is hard to take out right right
they Teknik want it but then there are
some that people have that are just kind
of like leeches like amplifiers of
emotions kind of make things worse and
those are pretty simple to take out so
it could go anywhere from 45 minutes to
several days that is the is the charge
the cost of this different depending on
whether it's a 45 minute in or out or
like a several day session well I don't
charge for it
you don't charge at all no no so how do
you know how do you make a living how do
you pay for the space where these these
are these events are taking place I'm a
screenwriter I've been a writer for many
many years on the same 15 years now yeah
really
are you just cut out there for a second
Rachel you said for 15 years you've been
a screenwriter right yes yes so I I make
a good living I don't I don't charge
people for my services there because I I
actually believe that whenever because
you know look I work on people who are
very very wealthy you know studio heads
rock icons all of these things yeah and
I also work on people who have very
little so I like to have everyone come
in here as equal this is an equal place
we're not we're no different in here
amazing well let's pause there just
briefly we're speaking with nan de nom
National exorcists Rachel stavis and
we'll continue our conversation with her
momentarily I'm continuing my endlessly
fascinating conversation with
non-denominational Exorcist Rachel
stavis her memoir is called sister of
darkness it's out now
Rachel I want to get on to some of the
other elements of this that I find to be
interesting how would you know if the
exorcism has worked well again for me I
can see I can see when the entity is no
longer there I can see when the trauma
and the blocks in the body have been
removed now for somebody else who's not
me right if you can't see in those terms
what I like to go by after that is the
sustainability of what's happened so you
know if you like for example if you go
to therapy right you go to therapy for
an hour but you go you keep going back
and eventually it gets better when we do
this we do it let's say the same amount
of time let's say it's an hour but it
sustains itself so that person doesn't
go backwards necessarily that's not true
with everyone because way free will do
want to do right but for people who were
really ready you can tell and you can
check in with them months later and
they're still in that same space if not
better so what would what evidence would
change your mind that exorcism is a real
thing in other words not that it exists
for you but even hypothetically like
what evidence could could you be
presented with that would make you say
you know what I was wrong exorcism isn't
real the demons aren't real the the
energy that I see visually it's not real
hypothetically what would it take for
you to re-examine that belief I think
the only thing that would make Miriam
and I believe and it's a real long shot
here is if it wasn't working for people
if if for some reason everything I was
doing stopped working for people all of
a sudden then I would be like okay what
the hell is going on well the thing is
it doesn't it seems like I mean if we're
gonna seriously test that I thought and
I'm what curious what you think about
this right if as serious people we want
to test the quote whether it works for
people you'd really need to have a
couple different sort of setups for
test because you would need to do so you
believe you're an exorcist and a client
comes in also believing you're an
exorcist and an exorcism takes place and
then we sort of evaluate their response
but really that would need to be
evaluated compared to bringing in a
client who believes that their service
provider is an exorcist but you would
want to bring someone in to provide the
service who is not a quote real Exorcist
like you who is doing something that
they deliberate they know is not really
an exorcism
so you would want to test that right
because if someone comes in and a non
Exorcist does a quote exorcism on them
and they also have the same so-called
results that would really call into
question with whether this is really
like a placebo effect thing that's going
on and then I'm curious whether you're
also familiar with the phenomenon of
spontaneous remission right which is
that anytime you're testing some kind of
therapy and I would I would call this a
therapy even though I don't think it is
therapy per se there's some percentage
of people whose condition is going to
resolve on its own so you would also
want to have a control group for that
why do you think that that's never been
done with exorcism well you know I can't
speak for for anyone uh-huh like here's
what I say yeah okay there are always
going to be people no matter what and
and I'm not saying that this is the case
here but even when you have something
that's exceptionally scientific and you
present fact after fact after fact about
it yep the reality about people is that
they are going to believe whatever they
want so in other words hold on Rachel do
you think that the science community
believes whatever they want or they
believe what's been demonstrated by the
facts because I think that that's the
important distinction well I don't think
it's necessarily all the science
community but if you're talking about
people on a general scale yeah you're
talking the world population if you're
talking about global warming for example
and you're proposing all of these
scientific you know accuracy is about
what's going on in global warming there
are still going to be people who say no
that's not accurate it's just the
of the world this is how we believe
right but now where I think science
might be different because in science
it's not just about a couple of climate
deniers we can still say well listen
here's what the consensus is and here's
the basis on which it's built so I think
I mean I think my disagreement would be
that you're sort of framing it as any
dissent means that there's not consensus
right but that's not true no no that's
not what I'm saying
here's let me put it this way please I
have no issue if someone wanted to
measure that and do that experiment with
me I don't know what other people or
what other exorcists or what the church
or any of that would allow no no but
it's not so here's the experiment as I
would do it right and I think I'm
curious and maybe maybe this could even
be done sometime you would maybe gather
ideally it'd be a big number right we'd
get a total of 50 people who are in
conditions where they want they are open
to an exorcism and they believe in the
concept of exorcism you would see 25 of
them and you would do your thing and
then like me or someone else someone
who's not trained as an exorcist would
come in the patients wouldn't know
whether they've got the quote real
Exorcist or not the real one we would
spend 45 minutes in with these people
and then we would see does the group of
25 that had the quote real Exorcist do
better than the 25 that were treated by
a fake Exorcist that and then you would
ideally also have another group of 25
who does nothing and we just check in
I'm joined today by Sean Flynn who is
the chair of the economics department at
Scripps College he's an entrepreneur he
studies free-market healthcare and is
also the best-selling author of
economics for dummies and he's also
running for Congress as a Republican and
Sean I've been following your work on
the Singapore healthcare system for a
long time and it's not often discussed
in the United States and the
conversations between sort of like a
total free market system which tends to
be favored by the American right versus
a sort of Medicare for All system or
single-payer system which is more
popular on the American Left talked a
little bit about the sort of primary
tenets of the Singapore health care
system well yeah David thank you so much
I guess that your intro is a great way
to slide into Singapore here because you
know we are very ideologically driven
when it comes to health care and social
reform in general in this country and
Singapore by contrast is just a total
pragmatist and so they've gone out and
collected various pieces and parts we
could discuss put them all together and
they're spending half as much as Canada
England France and about 75 percent less
than we are and they're covering every
one and they've got essentially the
world's best health care outcomes no
matter what statistic you look like or
they're you know they're in the top
three or four for everything and so I
think that's a good place to go is just
starting off with the non-ideological
nature of the system and just doing what
works to cover everyone yeah and they
have elements that are sort of more in
the for-profit free-market direction but
they also have some relatively I mean
hey heavy enough handed more
authoritarian style provisions that I
think would not be very palatable to the
American right can you talk a little bit
about how the system is structured sure
okay so one thing the American right and
I think most Americans would agree with
is you know we believe you know at least
all of us to some extent that markets
are the absolute best way to go in terms
of getting efficiency but that of course
you know there's other issues involved
than just efficiency but they've got
price tags on everything so you can go
to Singapore and say you needed a knee
surgery you could call around or go
online actually and just get the prices
for every awesome Pedic surgeon in the
country
which forces all the doctors to compete
against each other on both price and
quality and we know competition in
healthcare in the United States works
because we can point at things like
LASIK so anything here that is not
covered by our crazy insurance system
things like LASIK eye surgery cosmetic
surgery there treatments like laser
treatments for varicose veins anything
that we call elective is cash-and-carry
and free-market here and what you see is
prices falling year after year and you
see quality going up and so my favorite
example there is that LASIK eye surgery
used to be say 5000 an eyeball and you
can now find it for like 500 with a
Groupon right and you know a Groupon
means doctors are marketing they're
competing they're having to you know
figure out better ways to do anything so
Singapore has that so it's got price
tags and competition now the other two
that Shawn before we move on to the next
point to a drug that there is one other
factor also in Singapore that is working
to push prices down which is that
there's significant government
involvement in care right government is
a big player there in terms of the
hospitals and in other ways so again
it's sort of a blend of both ideas that
would be palatable to the left and right
okay so you're right about the
government so 80 percent of the acute
hospital beds right you know something
goes really wrong for you eighty percent
of the beds are in the big public
hospitals rather than private hospitals
but even there David so we need to
separate out the provision versus the
financing of healthcare so you're
absolutely right that the government is
doing a lot of the actual building of
the buildings and here's the hospital
but in terms of the finance and the
competition even those public hospitals
the way the financing works it's the
same system with the posted prices and
the competition between doctors and they
even made every public hospital with its
own independent nonprofit that can set
its own prices and can set its own you
know remuneration for the doctors and
staff so that even the public hospitals
have to compete against each other to
get people's business so it really is as
you say a remarkable blend but we need
to be careful there because the
healthcare finance assisting at least
this part with the prices and
competition it's system-wide including
the public hospitals so it's not as
though they're running one set of
competitive posted prices hospitals and
then there's another set that's
insulated from prices that happens to be
covered by the government the whole
system has this price pressure and
competition but the public and private
is it fair to say that you have a system
that in a sense would be like if I read
one line that if if Milton Friedman were
a socialist this would sort of be the
system he would have designed you know I
don't know who wrote that but um you
know given that Milton Friedman was
above all a practice trait you know I
wouldn't say you know even though his
reputation is hey I I'm a free market
guy at least in his own mind he was a
practical guy first and so whether he
would have been a socialist instead of
you know what we think it was this big
free-market advocate yeah I think this
would have been the first place you've
looked to because they're spending way
less than everyone and delivering way
care way better care to the entire
population like they don't shove their
veterans in a different system their or
their older people or poor people like
literally everyone's going to the same
hospitals and enjoying the same benefits
of their system so I think yeah that
would have had he been a socialist
appeal to him greatly what is the
connection if any between employment and
your employer in Singapore and your
health insurance um very very little if
it's there there are employers who are
for health care benefits but they're
above and beyond what is in the core
system and let me discuss that because
this goes back to finishing off your
your question earlier about their system
so one thing they have is all this price
transparency competition but you still
need to make sure that people have
access and so the way they do that in
Singapore and I would actually offer a
slightly different model for the United
States has been shown by you know state
of Indiana and work of Medicaid Whole
Foods Markets to work in the private
sector here but the core system over
there in terms of making sure there's
access is they first set up you know
what we call catastrophic insurance or
high deductible insurance here but then
they make sure everyone has a way to
actually pay their annual deductible
because as you know here with like
things like Obamacare bronze plans there
are a lot of people making $10 an hour
but they've got a $10,000 annual
deductible and in some sense they're
effectively uninsured even though
they're paying premiums they're not
going to have $10,000 to cover an annual
deductible stuff that's like that's the
core problem with any sort of high
deductible or catastrophic system okay
no message on let me just just so I'm
clear let me make sure I understand
where you're getting those numbers there
would be and and there is a maximum
yearly out-of-pocket that accounts both
for the deductible and the premium so
even though someone making 10 bucks an
hour on a bronze plan might on paper
have a ten thousand dollar deductible
their total yearly out-of-pocket would
be limited by the provisions that put a
maximum on how much relative to your
income you'd spend on health care in a
year yes effectively uninsured which
would defeat the entire purpose of the
you know the America of the Affordable
Care Act right and so you see the poor
they've got they've done it a slightly
different way but one that preserves the
incentives to always look around shop
around for the best deal
keep price competition and so what they
do there is there's a $2,000 year annual
deductibles basically the number and
then above that 10% copay all the way up
to infinity and so let them give me a
second there to show how people are
protected because that sounds dangerous
and so then what the government does to
make sure you've got some money in your
pocket at all times when you're born
they just give $3,000 over the health
savings account when you start working
you're required in Singapore to put
seven percent of your income every year
into a health savings account the
government's run properly so they
actually guarantee and four percent
interest so it's constantly accumulating
most people are quite healthy to learn
about my age mid-40s and so you have
these huge piles of health savings and
then people go out and they can cover
their annual deductibles and then they
can cover those co-pays and if for some
reason something goes really
catastrophic ly wrong and you know 10%
up to infinity means you could run out
of money right the government then has a
safety net there and they treat you
first and then you basically put in a
little grant application asking the
government hey I ran out of money could
you cover this and the answer there the
government that they approved ninety
nine point three percent of all the
applications so they've got this
rock-solid safety net in combination
with
health care system where there's
competition like even people are very
modest means there have money in their
pockets to actually go out and into a
consumer marketplace and put pressure on
the doctors to keep prices down because
they always have some skin in the game
yeah because they know any money they
don't spend out of that annual mm
adductor Bowl or that copay that 10%
above they get to keep and so that's the
other thing in their system that sort of
is the feedback mechanism that we've
currently lost in our system is there
isn't intense constant pressure by
consumers with their own bodies with
their own money to keep the providers in
line and providing things at low cost
and high quality yeah and this was the
next thing I wanted to talk about in
terms of you know just understanding
sort of the way the American political
spectrum sees this type of stuff which
is that mandatory health savings account
contribution I think it's a very very
interesting way to fund this and it's
not something that I'm against but you
would see particularly from members of
your party in the United States just
apoplectic nanny-state bs reactions to
that who's to tell me I need to put
aside 7 percent of my income for health
insurance even though of course we do it
with the first hundred and you know a
percentage of the first hundred and
twenty thousand we earn to Social
Security some some people have a problem
with that as well that would be a tough
pill to swallow for many in the United
States wouldn't it well I think so and
the fears might go even deeper to a
cynicism that says wow we've got all
these entitlement problems coming down
the line maybe they're gonna tell me
they're gonna take my health savings
account now but then later on they'll
redirected towards something else right
so there'd be a lot of political fears
yep so the way it's been handled here in
the United States is for instance Whole
Foods Markets they just make an annual
deposit in do their workers health
savings accounts right they just
essentially give to people or look from
the workers perspective it looks like a
gift there's this pile of money that
just goes in every year into their
health savings account and it
accumulates and there is told hey you've
also got high deductible coverage
catastrophic we gave you the amount of
the annual deductible anything you don't
spend you get to keep and that gives
them an incentive to shop around now of
course there are no price tags in their
system right so it's not you know all
these things put together but at least
the insurance company the way you handle
it here is instead of explicitly taxing
you just make it look like a gift right
it's their money on a total compensation
but it goes in their health savings
accounts and this is worked wonders you
know all across the income spectrum so
we have you know the example of the
healthy Indiana program that actually
was put in place in 2011 in the state of
Indiana and what they did there was they
had some extra tobacco tax revenue and
they said hey let's cover more working
for their people who currently are not
poor enough to qualify for Medicaid in
this state these are good people they're
working hard they're doing all the right
things we want them to move up and be
able to help their families so let's put
them into Medicaid but let's make it
look something like this this is what
Singapore does with the high deductible
and the annual deposits and so they
created a version of Medicaid there that
has an $1,100 per year annual deductible
which you might say oh my goodness if
someone you know working for very little
wages they can't afford that but then
the state also gifted each person $1,100
a year and so when you see that you
realize they're financially safe right
they've been given the $1,100 to cover
the annual deductible and then of course
it's Medicaid anything above the 1100 is
all on the government so these people
are equally financially safe and secure
is anyone on normal Medicaid where
there's you know first dollar coverage
right Medicaid approves it all spending
is in normal Medicaid starts with the
first dollar all the way up so it's
hundred-percent here you've got an
annual deductible but you give people
the amount of the annual deductible and
what you find when you put people into a
system like that and you tell them any
money you don't spend is money you get
to keep out of that annual deductible
next year there'll be another eleven
hundred and the third year another
eleven hundred when you tell people that
whether they're on Medicaid or there are
whole foods employee and we've got
randomized experiments I could point to
health care spending Falls by about a
third thirty to thirty five percent just
by people shopping around for the best
deal and you know not you know I used to
have you know through martial arts all
the time then I would always go and get
everything x-rayed even though I knew it
was almost nothing because I had a ten
dollar copay right but once it becomes
your own money you're a little more
cautious and he had the great rooms but
at the same time Sean I mean I want to
push back a little because it's been
pretty widely studied that the the myth
of people overusing healthcare merely
because they don't pay anything out of
pocket by and large people have lie
they're not just looking to get
procedures done for the sake of it and
big picture if a system is going to work
or not going to work I don't believe
it's going to be determined whether it
works or not by people saying hey you
know what since it's covered I'm gonna
go get procedures done and see doctors
well okay so I can you know don't mean
to stumble over my words here but I can
point you to overwhelming evidence
starting with the largest randomized
trial that was done by the RAND
Corporation over like 15 years and then
starting in the 1970s there's the
ongoing org and health insurance
experiment which was a full
randomization of Medicaid patients I can
actually point you to a ton of evidence
that says people cut back on their
spending about by 1/3 yeah but I think
what's missing from those studies in the
ones I've seen anyway is that it doesn't
account for the long-term cost savings
that the system experiences because some
of that stuff people are choosing to do
is going to prevent more expensive
conditions and treatment down the line
okay so that is the argument I could
show you the stuff I've seen in these
things for instance in the state of
Indiana they intentionally exempted all
the long-term care stuff and I could
point you to another Indiana thing where
it was state government employees
starting at 2007 the people are going in
for mammograms just as often the people
were going in for the annual treatment
you know the annual checkups just as
often I could go on with a whole bunch
of these yeah honestly looks these David
you're you're right you're right to be
suspicious about that but all the
evidence I've seen says it looks like
the people are going in for all the
preventative maintenance of the exact
same rate and and even with that Rand
Health Study back in the 70s they follow
people both before 5 years when they
were 5 to 10 years when they were in and
another 5 years after and except for
very minor things like the difference
between 20 26 and 2027 vision there were
no statistically significant differences
in health outcomes and this is a
little-known fact and I know people
should be very suspicious on this point
but all the evidence I've seen and I
looked hard yeah I really did is I
actually didn't believe in the Singapore
thing or any of this stuff I actually
came to this as a total doubter when I
first heard about it back in 2009 and
was honestly baffled at first when I
kept
then I had to fly to Singapore to
confirm that well it seems to work over
there and I kept going back and forth
but honestly David there's a pile of
evidence that that's not actually a
problem and let me give you just one
statistic so in the state of Indiana
with the government employees when
people were on PPOs or HMOs and they had
the choice between here's the expensive
brand-name drug and here's the
generically equivalent I'm sorry the
chemical equivalent generic drug when
they were on PPOs or HMOs and it was
someone else's money ninety three
percent of the time they've gone for the
more expensive one when you switch them
over into this you know this sort of
singapore's looking system with a high
deductible insurance and that you know
the gift of the annual deductible did
that fell from 93 percent of the time
choosing the expensive version of the
Jordan down to only 13 so you see these
massive sea changes in behavior that cut
the cost without cutting care and I
could give other examples like yeah I
know that I mean that's interesting I'm
open to being convinced of that you know
I just I'm not seen the evidence but I
want to look forward and I want to see
what what that is
I specifically with the Indiana data I'm
just not familiar with that data so I'm
open to looking at that Shawn this is
super interesting we are out of time and
I do want to tell people that you know
not not a ton of Republicans in our
audience but if people do want to find
out more about your campaign on issues
other than health care of what's the
best place for them to do that so the
today I'm welcoming a Ranma scavenge to
the program who escaped from the Church
of Scientology's international
headquarters outside Hemet California
back in 2012 he's the father of the
church's leader David Miscavige and I I
don't even know where to start
Ron because there's really so much to
discuss here but I think an interesting
point would be that many people don't
know that the reason your son now is
even in the church is because back I
believe it was in the 1970s you made the
decision to join the church is that
right that's exactly correct David and
what drew you to the Church of
Scientology to begin with well how about
if I do this if it's okay with you yes
can I give you just a thumbnail sketch
so you have an overview so then when I
present what happened with David when he
was a kid yeah it's gonna kind of fit in
okay so just let me do that first well
first of all I was a member of the
church for 42 years I was on staff in
the see organization for 26 and a half
years I escaped on March 25th 2012 and
about a year and three months later two
private investigators were caught around
the corner from where I'm living trying
to buy a house so they could spy on me
from morning till night
they looked suspicious a neighbor called
the cops and the West Allis police come
over I gather the name of Nick pie he
arrested him because the guy started
giving him a bunch of baloney is you
know am I breaking any law he's just
wise enough to him so next and say
you're under arrest you mind if I look
in your your van the guy said no it's
all right so he looked in Duane Powell
that's the name of the private
investigator and his son Daniel Powell
those are the two private investigators
he looked in his van and that the trunk
of that van he found five license plates
from five different states five handguns
a stun gun two rifles one with the
silencer fixed to it and two thousand
rounds of ammunition needless to say
these this gentleman was arrested and he
was interrogated and if you want to hear
the entire interrogation if you
go to my website which is called the
real Ron Miscavige calm you can hear the
entire interrogation as to what went on
well and if this these guys were being
paid ten thousand dollars a week to
follow me to report my every doing
between eight o'clock in the morning and
eight o'clock at night there's a couple
things that happened while this was
going on and one notable thing was this
there's a small town in Wisconsin called
Janesville where I happened to be
shopping one day in the summertime and
unbeknownst to me they were following me
all this time now I had a pocket t-shirt
on and in my left hand pocket tee shirt
pocket I had my cell phone I was putting
groceries in the car I bent over and I
thought that my cell phone was gonna
fall on the ground so I grabbed my left
chest they saw me and they said it looks
like our target they called me the
target yeah he's having is having a
heart attack so they called in and their
contact reg said listen I'll get
somebody on line several minutes later a
gentleman come on the line identified
himself as David Miscavige and said
listen if it's his time to die let him
die don't intervene don't do anything
Wow now that was my son this happening
and also my daughters being disconnected
from me because this is what they do and
by the way I gave you that the name of
that website the real run Miscavige calm
we did specific reason and that is this
the church if you leave they will try to
character assassinate you David they
bought 500 variations of my name and if
you gone any of these other than the
real run Miscavige calm it will take it
to a hate site Wow and their that they
try to character assassinate me this
it's not just me it's standard operating
procedure oh yeah and run just so you
know the bat we've interviewed a number
of former Scientologists so that we have
sort of a scent sense for so if I can
I'd like to pick up a couple of specific
points that sort of were mentioned in
there just to get our audience as much
context as possible you mentioned that
you were
in the church for 42 years what drew you
to the church to begin with what drew me
to the church was this David my son has
had asthma since he was a baby and it
I'll tell you something if you ever have
an infant who has asthma it is a very
pitiful sight then you feel helpless
because here's this little child trying
to catch his breath kind of trying to
save his own life and there's not a
goddamn thing you can do about it
excuse my French my friend but this was
the bane of my existence I got
introduced to Scientology through a
gentleman I met on a business I was
investigating at the time which was
called holiday magic yeah so multi
marketing thing and I met him at an
opportunity meeting he said he was a
Scientologist and he started telling me
about it and it very much struck my
interest long and short of it was this
David all the things I tried with him
nothing worked because I knew this at
best and the doctor I took them to dr.
Zigler would give him a shot of
adrenaline at best you're treating the
symptom so I heard a lot about
Scientology that it was good and that
would help people and they had a thing
called auditing which is another word
for counseling yeah I thought I took
David down to see this gentleman who was
a Scientologist Frank ogle took him in
45 minutes later David come out and said
dad I'm handled and he never had another
severe asthmatic attack as a child I got
to tell you at that moment I think that
was his Epiphany and I think it was at
that moment he decided this is something
I've got to do with my life so let me
know by now Ron just to make sure I
understand at this point none of you are
Scientologists not really we we I
dabbled in it Frank ogle had a little
group that met every Tuesday in his
theater cafeteria that in Woodbury New
Jersey I used to go there every Tuesday
and just kind of you know learn about
the communication formula about
interpersonal relationships but I never
really got into it yeah that was the
point in my life
where I decided if this can do this for
him I got to do it for my whole family
and that got me in the alum did you
eventually become part of the Sea Org
which is a seminar audience know sort of
like the upper epsilon and maybe
management would be an applicable term
of the Church of Scientology it would be
that and let me let me give you a little
bit of an analogy here and let's compare
it to the Catholic Church there are
several ways you can be on what they
call staff in Scientology one would be
you were joined a regular organization
where público to buy services they pay
for a service and they get it delivered
by staff members at that organization
the next level up would be the C
organization which delivers the upper
level so-called Scientology tenants and
then the top level would be like going
to Rome where the Cardinals are and that
would be in Hemet California that would
be the top excellent of management
that's where I was posted all the time I
was in for 26 and a half years and what
happened is I'm living my life and it
got to a point where all my kids were
grown up and I figured I want to help my
church listen man I was the kool-aid
drinker I got to tell you I got people
in Scientology I got him a joint staff
so I was right with that program and
there was no doubts in my mind this was
the best thing I could do for my family
and Roy are those positions well paid or
is it more sort of the appearance of
responsibility that's appealing about
that you think when you do that you're
helping every man woman and child on
this planet to lead a better life that's
what you're indoctrinated into believing
and I'm telling you if people are
interested in reading my book which is
called rootless Scientology my son David
Miscavige and me if you read the book
you will see how on an incremental
little-by-little basis you are led down
the path to believe everything they tell
you as being the absolute truth that l
ron hubbard no matter what he said
that was yen doll you didn't have to
question anything you didn't have to
think for yourself at that point and
that's actually how a lot I mean it's
interesting because that's both how
that's how the Mafia actually works
which is hey listen let's just I'm gonna
do this for you and then someday maybe
you'll just check up on this person for
me and then it's piece by piece you're
sort of sucked in a bit at a time isn't
it exactly right and I'll tell you this
it's so clever and there's so many
little guideposts or little red flags
that go up that you you will ignore and
I'll tell you how this works just
briefly the bottom of the bridge when I
say the bottom of the bridge what I mean
by that is this the whole Scientology
experience is called the bridge to total
freedom right those initial courses that
you do are actually valuable they mean
there is a communication course that
teaches you the exact communication
formula and if you apply this in your
life there's no two ways about it you're
gonna do better you'll be able to handle
situations and handle people and get on
better than before you did the course
and there's other things that you do
these are confidence builders and once
you do that somewhere along the line
something may be introduced to you that
you think I don't know if I agree with
this this is but everything so far
they've told me has been true I'll
accept it right that's it at that point
you looked Ron let me ask that point let
me ask you this though were there actual
because I've spoken to a lot of former
Scientologists and while they describe
the same mechanism you're describing for
how they get sort of pulled in further
and further none of them have reported
sort of genuinely believing like the
creation story of Scientology which
includes this absurd age of the earth
for example or stories about Xenu did
you believe that stuff as well let me
tell you and I'll say this first of all
I accepted it now I guess you could say
I have a bit more of an analytical mind
than the average person walking the
streets in other words what I mean by
that is this
I heard the story about the problem
being in his sector of the universe
overpopulation 150 billion people per
planet what I thought was this how the
hell are you gonna get all these people
down here in dc-8
these are not big airplane very
practical analysis very practical but
you know what I said well everything
they told me so far yeah I'm just gonna
I'm just gonna have to accept this do
you see that I'm going to have to accept
it to be a good Scientologist right and
I'm telling you man it's it's very
nefarious it's very very tricky the way
this happens and there's a lot of other
things like little rules that you have
to follow don't talk about your case in
other words what I mean by that is this
your reaction to life other than looking
at life exactly the way it is would be
called your case the way you react to it
you get counseling or auditing don't
talk to anybody about what happens in
your auditing session so you can't
compare notes with somebody else and say
hey wait a minute I think this is a
bunch of crap what do you think no if
you do that you're in trouble you have
to go to see the ethics officer and you
have to pay for confessional oddity at
your expense let's pause there let's
pause there because I think it's a good
good spot to take a quick break we're
speaking with Ron Miscavige who escaped
from the Church of Scientology's
international headquarters he's the
father of the current leader of the
Church of Scientology David Miscavige
and that's where we'll pick up our
conversation we're continuing our
conversation with Ron Miscavige who
escaped from the Church of Scientology's
international headquarters in 2012 he's
the father of the leader of the church
David Miscavige I want to talk a little
bit about how your son ultimately
ascended to be the leader of the church
but before we do that Ron you talked
about you use the word escaped you
escaped for the church talk to us about
for the people who've not heard this
what mechanisms are there that are
keeping you there such that you would
even use the word escape
your own mind that's what's keeping you
there you and as I said earlier in the
programs people care to read my book
you're gonna see the modus operandi how
exactly this is done little incremental
agreements little gradient bit-by-bit
you build up agreements in your own mind
so that you literally build a mental
prison that keeps you there
matter of fact but there there are
people who have left the church and
they'll agree with me when I say this if
you were to take a bus and crash that
gate in Hemet California and go on the
base where there are people there many
of whom have been there 10 20 30 and
even 40 years I don't know if you'd get
one person they did on that bus to get
out you could tell them listen we'll
give you a job we'll give you $20,000
we'll give you a place to live I don't
know any takers but there are some
people who are being held there more
than just mentally or psychologically I
mean I've spoken at some of them right
exactly right
yeah so now what was the point we were
bringing up here sort of what what the
nature of using the world scape was yeah
ok so look if I would have said to them
I'm tired of this
I don't want to be here anymore I want
to leave I would still be there my wife
and I would have been seized we would
have put under guard we would have been
guarded 24 hours a day we would have
been sit down in front of an E major and
have to cough up our transgressions
against the group daily on for hours and
hours and hours and when we weren't
doing that we'd be doing labor physical
labor now I knew that I couldn't get out
by just saying I want to leave so my
wife and I Becky planned our escape it
took us six months to plan that escape
and I can tell you this
we had a plan it down to the detail as
an example one of the things I would do
to make it okay for me to go from one
part of the base to the other part of
the base every Sunday morning was this
on Sunday morning
they have what they call CSP queenship
project where you clean your apartment
and you have some breakfast around nine
o'clock in the morning but between 9:00
and 12:00 you're cleaning every Sunday
morning I would drive from the south
side of the base through one of the
gates that was not worried guards work
go to the north side because on the
north side was the music studio where I
worked there was a refrigerator there we
couldn't have any food in our apartments
in that refrigerator I kept Italian
salami maybe Parmesan cheese some treats
and then I would drive through the main
gate where the guards were and every
Sunday morning I would give them some
cheese some salami in other words I was
getting them acclimated to the fact that
they'd see me going across the north
side and coming back where they were and
they'd get a treat it's feeding the
watchdog's in other words okay yep so
now six months of planning of sending
things off the base the people that we
knew so we could have at least some
things when we left come Sunday morning
9 o'clock in the morning I Drive out
from our apartment and by the way this
whole story is in a book just for your
listeners I Drive past the the mess hall
and there were only two guards on duty
on Sunday morning one of the guards was
at the main booth that was Jurgen and
the other guard would be down in the
mess hall having breakfast he had what
they call the chase car that was south
now I passed that place and I saw the
car there and I knew that by the time I
got to the gate down the road which was
about 200 yards down from the main gate
Sal would still be having breakfast now
my car is loaded with my horns my
exercise equipment clothes if the guard
would have said come up to the main
booth I was dead in the water I pressed
the button didn't say award the gate
opened up I said to my wife we're
turning left I trumped on that gas pedal
and we were going about 80 miles an hour
down the road and about a mile down the
road there was a decision to be made
where you either turn right which was
route 10 it would take you to LA go
straight on route 60 which would take
you to LA or turn left and go into town
I knew that once Jurgen saw that I was
leaving he'd be on his Nextel yelling
run what the hell are you doing get back
here and then he'd be on the phone would
sell by the time sell in the chase car
got after the booth I would be at that
decision point and I decided to turn
left for sure he would think I was going
right on route 10 or correct excuse me
straight ahead on route 60 once we
turned left and got into town I was free
well at that point I knew I had escaped
successfully we drove across the United
States for about two and a half days I
paid for everything with cash because if
I would have used my credit card that
would have traced me send somebody out
on an airplane and captured me and
taking me back incredible that old that
old story is in the book I just
mentioned Ron how did David who now is
the leader of the church how did he end
up in that position I'll tell you how we
ended up in that position and this is an
interesting story and I I go into it in
detail in the book which of course
doesn't have to keep on saying that but
I do look have you ever heard the
expression power tends to corrupt and
absolute power corrupts absolutely
of course okay now I always thought it
was Winston Churchill who said that that
was a gentleman by the name of Lord
Acton he lived from 1834 till early
1900's he was a member of parliament he
is the one who said that and by the way
he also said which very few people know
great men are almost always bad men
and the hell of a statement now here's
what happened to David when he was
sixteen fifteen years old he was going
to be 16 I came home from work one day
walked in a house and he's in his
bedroom kind of leaning back with his
head in his hands and I saw he was
pondering something I said Dave what's
up man he's that he's I don't want to go
to school
more ice what do you mean you don't want
to go to school anymore he's and look at
he's AI just none of the kids listen to
the teacher they take drugs
I want to go help l ron Hubbard well to
me this was a shot but I thought to
myself you know what when I was 17 years
old I decided I wanted to join the
Marine Corps mm-hmm now my dad had to
sign for me because unless you're 18 you
can't go on your own volition and I
remember him saying to me Ronnie are you
sure you know what the hell you're doing
these guys are the first ones in and I
said yes dad I want to join the Marines
as it turned out that turned out to be
one of the best decisions I've ever made
in my life from the first night in boot
camp where I said this is the worst
goddamn mistake I've ever made in my
life - twelve weeks later when I thought
to myself I can make myself do anything
they've turned me in from an
today's classic interview is sort of a
preview of a really good interview that
we're going to have for you next week a
couple years ago I interviewed Chris
Shelton who was a high-level
Scientologist and he held nothing back
he told all and the reason I'm going
back to this interview today is that
next week we will be doing a very
interesting interview with Ron Miscavige
and if the last name Miscavige rings a
bell it should because he is the father
of David Miscavige friend of Tom Cruise
and current leader of the Church of
Scientology his father Ron Miscavige
will join me next week for what I think
will be a tremendously interesting
interview and to get ready for that to
get in the mindset we're gonna go back
to my February of 2016 interview with
Chris Shelton I'm joined today by Chris
Shelton who's a former high-level
Scientologist he was a Scientologist for
27 years he's the author of the recent
book Scientology a - Xenu an insider's
guide to what scientology is really all
about love the title of the book so tell
me how did you get into Scientology I
mean was it was it through your parents
are you a second jet were you a second
generation Scientologist I was about
four years old and what was the earliest
memory or what what are your earliest
memories of Scientology my earliest
memories actually are hanging out at the
Pasadena organization back in the 70s
growing up and doing some classes doing
some some children's type classes
communication courses and things like
that it didn't make any sense to me it
was pretty confusing stuff so I was
gonna say what are what are children
taught like at what what types of things
are taught to kids who are saying in
Scientology well you're raised with the
lingo of course and some of the basic
concepts of it in terms of you know
you're a spirit and that sort of thing
but courses classes wise they have
children's communications course and
they have children's study courses and
things like that and when you well I
guess as it as it for people who aren't
all
he sort of initiated into this talk a
little bit about the levels of
Scientology and then talk to us a little
bit about what level you got to and sort
of what that means
sure Scientology promises a sort of
personal spiritual immortality and and
personal freedom is how they call it
right a sort of a godhood or you know
apotheosis sort of thing and they have
this divided into levels of services
that you do as you go as you climb this
bridge to total freedom they call it and
you know a sort of crossing from this
you know horrible existence on earth to
this wonderful spiritual immortality
sort of thing and along the way are all
these different levels through the
counselling they offer the first one the
first milestone being was called the
state of clear and this was something
described in Dianetics this is old back
to 1950 before you know predates
Scientology which is you know sort of a
full release from all psychoses and
neuroses and things in your mind that
are that are affecting you from past
traumatic experiences and whatnot and
you know and I have to just say upfront
it'd be wonderful if these things really
existed but they don't so you know but
this is this is how they described it so
first you have clear and then above that
are these higher levels of spiritual
awareness and ability which are called
operating thetan levels or OT levels
thetan being the Scientology word for a
spiritual being they don't call it a
soul or a spirit they call it a thing so
you have these levels that you go
through and that's where the Xenu story
for example comes in is it is at ot
level three and there are eight released
ot levels in Scientology and to what
level were you able to ascend I got to
the state of clear but like many many
many Scientologists that was achieved
and then taken away because there was
you know about three or four times now
they've done these reviews where they
they say Oh
yeah I know you you didn't really make
it and so now you're required to pay
more money because we you know didn't
actually get it done properly and you're
gonna pay to redo services you've
already done because we didn't you
didn't really achieve it but for me if
you can what is the cost average right
to get to the clear level what do people
more or less pay by the time they've
gotten to that point okay and that might
be over a period of how many years to go
but well at least a year I mean you know
at least that but generally speaking
people take years to get to the state of
clear because it costs a lot of money
and it takes a lot of time and they and
especially over the last 20 years or so
they've really been milking people so it
could be upwards of two hundred thousand
dollars and that's between you know
donations as well as the the counseling
you're paying for or they make you buy
Hubbard's lectures and listen to them
and his books and you have to read them
and there's there's a lot of costs
involved in Scientology that are sort of
hidden costs that you don't know about
until you become part of the system they
hit you up for money all the time in
your heart of hearts when you were
really in this right did you literally
believe all of the teachings of
Scientology I mean l ron Hubbard I've
read about him talking about his trips
to Venus and Mars I believe and you know
we thought we know about the the I
forget even the the age of the universe
under under the teachings of Scientology
but it's it's just an outrageous number
did you truly believe that or did you
always have some sort of doubts about
those stories no I I was for many years
it was very easy for me to be a science
denier because you believed l ron
Hubbard you believed what he says and he
you know castigate science and physics
and and I hate everything really that
disagrees with him and he claims to be
the only one who have discovered these
it's about life and you know you go okay
well there's a certain degree of
possibility that somebody can discover
something that nobody else knows and
then share his work so you go okay you
give a little bit then you give a little
bit and give a little bit and then
really what happens is before you really
have thought the whole thing through
after you know months and years of this
you're accepting things is true that are
absolutely ludicrous that on day one you
never would have accepted but as you've
progressed through this belief system
and accepted Hubbard's authority on
things you find yourself believing
things like you know the universe being
you know it's trillions and quadrillions
of years old and you know he could
travel spiritually to venus and mars and
things like that you know there are so
many allegations of assault and abuse
and violence in the Sea Org where where
you ultimately worked with in which you
worked ultimately were you ever arrested
yes I was personally it was one of his
juniors who did it
and there's a lot of physical abuse not
just physical assault like directly
somebody hitting you but there's you
know much much overworked sleep
deprivation the see organization is
Scientology's clergy it's the core group
of Scientology that are working 24/7 and
it's a paramilitary group so there's
ranks and ratings and people are saying
sir and saluting and all that and you I
mean there was a period of a week one
time where we were working on a
particular project where I I got about
three hours sleep over a five-day period
there's it's it's an intensely dedicated
group and they take it way too far in
how hard they're worked for the cause
and and there's a lot of burnout a lot
of people you know just crash and burn
and end up leaving and and the and at
one point I was in a high intensity
situation where somebody the senior
person to me got very very very
set with me over something I didn't even
do wrong that was what was really so
unjust about the whole thing and she
ended up you know beating me in front of
a roomful of people to make her point
that she was very upset with me she
struck me grabbed me and and beat me and
it sort of understood that you can't
retaliate in a situation like that
oh very much so it had I done anything
other than accept it I would have
instantly been sent to Scientology's
rehabilitation project force or the RPF
and ironically you know I ended up there
for anyway two years later but that's
that's that would definitely have been
the consequences of me retaliating or
speaking back or or even complaining
later to somebody else even after things
did chilled out if I had gone and said
this was wrong and shouldn't have
happened and all that she was in such a
position that it would have been
unquestionable it would be unthinkable
to have said anything against her you
recruited more than ten people the exact
number offhand I don't remember but I
think it was somewhere between 10 and 12
people to the Sea Org question was are
any of those people still part of the
Sea Org and to do you feel guilty for
having recruited those individuals yeah
I don't know for sure I know some of
them left before I did I don't know if
all of them are still in or not and
guilty yeah I guess I do
I am I certainly am NOT happy about it I
wish I you know I I of course at the
time was not doing it out of malice or
because I thought I was part of a con
job I honestly believe that what we were
doing was was truly making a difference
and was truly going to save the world
that those were the words I would have
used and in fact those are the words I
did use to recruit people so I was a
fervent believer at that point but then
looking back on it yeah I'm regretful
about it I wish I hadn't done that I'm
gonna remind everybody Kris Shelton's
book is Scientology A to Z new an
insider's guide to what science
is really all about let's take a break
on our TV and radio show we're gonna
continue a little bit longer with Chris
Shelton and talk about SP suppressive
persons the full interview will be on
our YouTube channel so Chris let's talk
a little bit about as I mentioned
suppressive persons you know my mom at
one point inadvertently hired a
scientologist handyman and I was sort of
left to monitor his work when she was on
vacation and he started talking to me
about Scientology and initially I
thought he was sort of bringing it up to
sort of make fun of it with me or poke
fun in some way and it became clear
immediately when I said oh yeah that's
the the religion based on that science
fiction guy's books right sort of
innocently he very quickly went and
talked to me about how no people who
believe that are suppressive and of
course I realize more than 10 years
later he was referring to suppressive
persons so explain to our audience sort
of what that status is and what that
means
yeah suppressive persons were originally
formulated by Hubbard in the in the 60s
as the antisocial personality and they
were presented as the kind of person or
the kind of personality that you would
read about in the sociopath next door
you know like that I got like a really
bad bad person a Christie or a Hitler or
a Napoleon as' or some of the examples
Hubbard gave and and of course those
people exist and they're it's very easy
to see in history and in the news that
such personalities exist however over
the company's few years what happened
was that label of calling somebody a
suppressive person started taking on
sort of internal political and and you
know control overtones where if somebody
started speaking out against Hubbard
they were automatically obviously
psychotic nuts because look at what
Hubbard was how great he was and so this
label of a suppressive person started
being used as the control mechanism
within the Church of Scientology and if
you were labeled a suppressive person
Scientologists assume you must have done
something to deserve it and because the
church of course
never do this to control people right
and so they just accept that if you were
declared or labeled this oppressive
person you have done bad things and they
don't even need to know all the
specifics of it
originally the it was written on a piece
of yellow or goldenrod paper your name
suppressive person declare and you know
her Shelton is - here my first Preston
because he did X X Y Z Y & Z Z and they
would post these up on noticeboards and
and everybody would know that they
needed to break contact with you forever
you were no longer you were persona non
grata and this includes family friends
business associates everybody sounds
like a you know in New York City and
parking garages around holiday time they
put up a board and they thanked people
who have tipped and so it's sort of like
a board of shame if your name's not on
the board you know people are I guess
supposed to think less of you this is
sort of the opposite they put up on the
board the names of the people that are
our suppressive what had you done to be
labeled as such I simply spoke my mind I
posted on the internet that I have
disagreements with Scientology I had had
a bad bad very long series of bad
experiences with Scientology because
they were persecuting me
and then they as a result of that they
declared me a suppressive person night
it was really simply exercising my First
Amendment rights you don't you don't
really have those rights in Scientology
they say you do but that you don't not
if you not if you direct that criticism
towards the church or its leaders and
and I you know whilst my fiancee I lost
friends I'd had for twenty years
overnight all gone and that was that was
quite devastating and that's that's a
it's a tool the the church wields to
control its members and keep them in
line
yeah we've spoken to Marty Rathbun
Claire Headley and Laurie Hudson and
they've all sort of told their story of
leaving and of separation and described
it similarly to how you're talking about
it
what were you able to leave in a simple
way or was it even difficult for you to
leave the Sea Org and Scientology it
took me nine months to what they call
route out or leave the sea organization
because I didn't want to work for them
anymore but I still wanted to be a
Scientologist at that point this was in
2012 I still I didn't I was kind of you
know okay I'm done working for this
group it's you know I'm not really
achieving my goals personally I'm not
happy
so after 17 years working for the Sea
Org I said okay and that's enough I want
to quit I went through the whole process
you have to do to do that and in
December 2012 I was no longer a sea org
member but I was still a Scientologist I
started being persecuted because at what
I didn't realize is that as an X sea org
member you're the lowest of above you
were treated as a third-class citizen
you are you know sort of like back to
the line we don't want you around that
sort of thing and yet I was trying to
make a go of it as a Scientologist as a
public Scientologist now I was kind of
pay for my services I wanted to you know
do take take part of all the goods that
I had been you know getting other people
to for all those years and then then
they weren't gonna have any part of that
and it got me looking more deeply into
what is this really all about that that
I'm being treated this way and that's
when I got on the internet and that's
when I went down the rabbit hole and
found out all about all the lies that
Hubbard and Scientology are actually all
about and it took me about three months
to get through a lot of that and really
delve in and and get the facts in the
matter and I was so upset I mean there
really aren't words to describe how
upset I was after spending 27 years of
my own life doing this and finding out
it was all you know so I started
speaking out and shortly thereafter I
lost all connection isn't I was declared
a suppressive person last thing I want
to touch on in the very limited time we
have left since the book came out
have there been repercussions threats
contact with Scientologists
I'm in direct communication sent my way
that indicated to me that they are
keeping an eye on me and you know I've I
have mixed feelings about it it's not
unexpected you know I've been a pretty
vocal advocate and critic and I intend
on continuing that you know the and that
and what that really tells me is the
force that my book is the truth and they
don't like it and that people should
read it well I mentioned once more the
book is Scientology a-to-z new an
insider's guide to what Scientology is
really all about we've been speaking
with the book's author Chris Shelton
Chris thanks so much for sharing your
story
absolutely thank you and they can find
the book on Amazon by the way
[Music]
the david pakman show at david
pakman.com it looks like yet another
piece of that infamous Christopher
Steele Trump Russia dossier the one that
the trumpets have been sort of going
apoplectic to try to debunk for months
now another element of it seems to have
been proven true or at least
corroborated and you might remember you
might not that one of the assertions of
the steel dossier was about the
involvement of Blackwater founder Eric
Prince in trying to set up a
back-channel between the Russian Kremlin
and then president-elect Trump it was in
January of 2017 before the inauguration
of Trump that supposedly Eric Prince was
trying to set up this back-channel and
as a quick reminder Blackwater is the
mercenary firm often hired by the US
government
Eric Prince is its founder he also
happens to be the brother of Secretary
of Education Betsy DeVos which is a
story for a different day if that's new
information to you and after the dossier
surfaced alleging that prince tried to
set up this back-channel prince denied
it
his attorney denied it and we now have a
new report months and months later which
says that Robert Muller might already
have evidence that indeed Eric Prince
did exactly this tried to establish this
back channel between the Trump
transition team and Kremlin operatives
and the Washington Post has a great
story on it where they report that a
witness who is cooperating with Robert
mullahs investigators says yeah the
meeting took place and the meeting took
place in January of 2017 and what Eric
prince told congressional investigators
he didn't deny that the referenced
meeting happened he denied that it was
planned saying instead oh it was a
totally chance
encounter and also denied that it had
anything to do with US Russia relations
visa vie the inauguration of President
Donald Trump but that happens to be the
exact opposite of what this cooperating
witness has told Robert Muller according
to the Washington Post report and
according to the witness the meeting was
not a chance encounter it was set up in
advance and it was specifically set up
so that a representative of Trump's
transition team would meet a delegate
from Russia specifically to figure out
how to communicate in the future and
we're now getting beyond sort of
circumstantial inaccuracies or something
you could write off to a semantic
disagreement right there's no way that
we can say semantics explains the
difference between Eric Prince's version
of events and this cooperating witnesses
version of events you can't say the
language was ambiguous there are
somebody is flat-out lying here if these
are the assertions that have been made
by each party either it was a planned
meeting or it was a chance encounter
that Eric prince absolutely did not
expect if it's a planned meeting then
Eric prince directly lied to
investigators and that's something that
usually ends up with you having a pretty
bad time and this also sort of more
broadly shows the consistent pattern by
Trump associates to try to create back
channels right because it's not just
Eric Prince from Blackwater accused of
trying to create a back channel to
Russia you might remember that the exact
same accusation exists against Donald
Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner the
accusation that he met with Russian
ambassador Sergey kis lyac to do almost
this exact same thing potentially on a
sort of more ongoing basis than just for
the transition period Kushner was
looking at doing this at creating this
back-channel to the Kremlin specifically
to get around American intelligence
agencies awareness of what it is that
they're doing and as I read about this
there's no way that Moeller's team is
just feeling around right I mean they
clearly know what is going on and are
trying to see who's lying about this at
this point last week we kind of talked
about it and I pointed out
and it's not something that I came up
with uniquely right I mean it's widely
known that when investigators at this
level the the investigators working at
the level of Robert Muller when they
asked questions they asked questions
typically that they already know the
answers to to try to figure out who is
lying and where there are disagreements
or inconsistencies but they must know in
this case what the truth is and I would
love to see Eric prints taken down
reportedly a multi-billionaire just like
his sister Betsy DeVos who has made just
disgusting amounts of money basically
selling private war services to
governments including the government of
the United States and if you're
wondering what's going on with
Blackwater these days I haven't heard
much about it that's because they've
changed their name
Blackwater technically no longer exists
it was first called Blackwater it was
then renamed Z services like X E even
more innocuous and then later renamed
Academy with an AI most companies don't
want to be regularly changing names
because you sort of build brand
awareness and recognition under one
particular name this is the opposite a
cat when you hear the name Academy with
an AI you say
Blackwater and mercenary services and
private war contracting that doesn't
sound at all like a company that would
be doing that that's exactly what they
want and indeed Blackwater as black
water doesn't even exist anymore yeah
that's a problem and also we know that
patronage and nepotism is rampant yeah
this White House do you think this
connection led to Betsy DeVos becoming
the education secretary that's been the
speculation for a while I mean she her
husband and her I mean she has got a ton
of money as well I don't want to make it
seem like it's the guy who wears a
million dollar they both between them
were donating the max2
Trump and cronies and whatever so yeah I
mean certainly I would speculate that
the Eric prince connection is a
connection that was relevant for her but
also she and her husband were donating
big bucks to Trump so I think there's no
question that she had no business being
Secretary of Education there's no doubt
about that
how she got into the position could have
been Eric Prince could have been because
of her donations who knows at this point
but yet another piece of the steel
see a reportedly corroborated this is a
big story that happened over the last I
guess we would say 12 took 12 to 14
hours you probably know if you watch our
show that for weeks and weeks and weeks
the White House has been super careful
not to admit that Donald Trump was in
any way involved or even knew about the
hundred and thirty thousand dollars in
hush money that was paid and the
non-disclosure agreement that was put in
place for pornstar stormy Daniels who
had an affair with Donald Trump I think
at this point we can say with basic
basically total certitude that the
affair took place it's a question of how
much Trump was involved in the cover-up
and the framing all along from the Trump
side has been first of all it's all made
up now if you don't believe that it's
all made up and increasingly people
don't the argument is the payment was
made personally by Trump's personal
attorney Michael Cohen the
non-disclosure agreement doesn't even
have Trump's signature on it which we
talked about yesterday is probably a way
to try to maintain plausible deniability
about the entire thing but the strategy
all along has been never acknowledged
that anything took place and certainly
don't acknowledge that Trump had any
knowledge of or involvement in any deal
making whatsoever with stormy Daniels
regardless of whether you believe that
the affair did or didn't take place it
all blew up in Trump's face yesterday
and he is now reportedly furious with
his press secretary Sarah Huckabee
Sanders because she seemed to
accidentally admit at least it appeared
to be an accident that Donald Trump was
involved in arbitration with stormy
Daniels and presumably knew about that
hush money payment and the
non-disclosure agreement in in this
apparent desperation to show that Trump
came out on top
Sarah Huckabee Sanders said we won this
in arbitration and of course any normal
person would say well if you're
admitting that there's something to win
it sorry if you're admitting that you
won something you're admitting that
there was something to win which has not
been directly acknowledged until
yesterday take a look at this first clip
breasts
our feelings on that situation in
regards to the stormy Daniels payments
but specifically can I ask did the
president approve of the payment that
was made in October of 2016 by his
longtime lawyer and advisor Michael
Cohen look the president has addressed
these directly and made very well clear
that none of these allegations are true
this case has already been won in
arbitration and anything beyond that I
would refer you to the president's
outcome outside counsel when did the
president address specifically the cash
payment it was made in October of 2016
has denied the allegations against him
and again this case has already been won
and arbitration anything beyond that I
would refer you to outside counsel about
that at this time though I've addressed
this as far as I can go yeah so listen
number one Jeff Zeleny is right that
Trump hasn't addressed this directly but
let's ignore that for now because twice
there Sarah Huckabee Sanders says we
Trump won this in arbitration and there
was follow-up because it didn't get by
the reporters in the room who realized
if something has been won then who won
it and when and in this next clip I
apologize because the sound on the
source clip glitches but I think we'll
still be able to figure out sort of the
gist of what sarah huckabee Sanders is
saying here you said that there's
arbitration that's already been won by
by the president's personal attorneys
and for details on that I would refer
you to them you're aware of them so what
can you more can you hear with us I can
share that counsel on any details beyond
that yellow that second part is huge
right Sarah Huckabee Sanders is the
White House press secretary she doesn't
report about issues that relate only to
Trump's attorney Michael Cohen right in
fact she's super careful basically to
never explain anything to say anything
that doesn't relate directly to Donald
Trump she just says listen I'm the White
House press secretary and I can't speak
about that because it relates to this
person or that person who don't work in
this administration the fact that she
says something means that it relates to
Donald Trump and that Trump won
something in our
betrayin now it's not true that Trump
want anything in arbitration by the way
but that doesn't matter because the big
thing here is if she even says that
there was something for Trump to win
it's because there is some agreement and
totally predictably Trump is furious
Trump is furious with Sarah Huckabee
Sanders she had been doing so well I
guess compared to Sean Spicer I don't
know what the what the frame of
reference is and a source said to CNN
POTUS is very unhappy Sarah gave the
stormy Daniel storyline steroids
yesterday and then we got a follow-up
statement from stormy Daniels's attorney
who said yeah and he won the popular
vote to president Trump hasn't won
anything related to Miz Clifford that
stormy Daniels real name first of all it
doesn't appear as if he was even a party
to the arbitration miss Sanders is
referring to how can you win something
you're not even a part of secondly
claiming that mr. Trump won at
arbitration when there has been no
hearing no notice to miss Clifford no
opportunity to get given to her to
respond and no decision on the merits is
completely bogus not a good day for
Sarah Huckabee Sanders and clearly not a
good day for the narrative that Trump
has no idea it's all super confusing
where is this story coming from we don't
get it and I've said before that I find
Sarah Huckabee Sanders to be she
transmits this visceral feeling of
grandiosity about herself she really
seems to relish sort of exerting control
over the press corps during these
briefings and I for one am glad that she
has finally now slipped up and might
experience the wrath of an unhappy
Donald Trump yeah yesterday you were
talking about who in the White House is
likely to be the next to go I didn't
name her Sarah Huckabee Sanders wasn't
on that list now after this gaffe I
think you have to put her on there
things can to make a 180 very very
quickly with Trump you can get on
Trump's bad side in an instant and that
is what it appears that Sarah Huckabee
Sanders did so what will be next I mean
listen ultimately I think we all realize
that there's going to have to be some
accounting for or explanation of the
entire stormy Daniels thing my
diction would be that without ever
admitting anything we will get some kind
of statement saying yeah we paid her off
because she was lying at a time when it
could have affected the campaign and we
wanted to get her out of the way without
ever admitting anything although it
becomes more and more difficult to
believe that with every passing day send
me your thoughts on this story I'm on

subreddit nearly 6,000 of our viewers
and listeners regularly discuss and
debate politics there a few interesting
discussions that I saw this morning when
I browse david pakman.com slash reddit
1 is a post arguing that the left
doesn't take anti-semitism seriously and
the post specifically relates to the
vile and toxic anti-semite Louis
Farrakhan Farrakhan I'm not even sure
how to pronounce his last name but big
picture I've talked about this issue
before I do think that there is a
problem on the left of not taking
anti-semitism seriously there's the idea
that Jews are doing great in the United
States and so even if there is any kind
of antipathy towards Jews we don't
really need to worry about it and it's a
very very easy way to minimize
anti-semitism and I generally do agree
with that so yes very interesting
discussion also from the David Pakman
show subreddit a poster says I honestly
enjoy
the David Pakman show but does anyone
else think he can be very condescending
to callers and guests and interestingly
just about everybody who responded the
depth of this said no I don't think
David is condescending to the guests I
think that David is very direct with
them if they're wasting time or if
they're not getting to a question or if
they're filibustering but you should
watch other shows if you think David is
condescending to guests
I I don't you know listen I'm not gonna
baby if you're choosing to call into a
show and make a political claim I'm not
gonna treat you like you're a kid if I
disagree with you I will tell you if I
believe that you're not defending your
assertion I will tell you and if I think
you're wasting my time I will also tell
you but it's not like people are victims
when they choose to call into the show
and make a point right I I don't know I
intend to disagree with sometimes we're
a little too respectful I would say I
argue the same thing when I allow
someone to go on for two minutes without
asking any questions and then eventually
I say listen you're killing me I got to
get the question from you it's it's my
television though I don't disagree but
it also is necessary we got to move the
show along right also from the David
Pakman show subreddit is there a way to
be pro-israel and not support Benjamin
Netanyahu yeah you just say I believe
Israel should exist and is a valuable
project and I am against Benjamin
Netanyahu I mean it's it's sort of
straightforward I think maybe the better
question or maybe the implicit question
here is is there a way without
supporting the current regime to still
be seen as a supporter of Israel and I
would argue it depends who you ask
because there are definitely extremist
right-wing elements who see anything
short of total support for Benjamin
Netanyahu as being against Israel yeah
and yeah I mean the answer is very clear
and resounding yes feel like you've been
doing it for a long time Pro anti
Benjamin Netanyahu please please and
thank you I appreciate that I wasn't
gonna pat myself on the back but if
you're gonna point out that's my
position I'll gladly accept it also from
the David Pakman show subreddit a very
interesting article about how the NRA
and its allies used jargon and semantics
to bully gun control supporters this is
very very true and one really good
example is that
because the ar-15 rifle has played a
role in so many mass shootings it's
become popular for the pro-gun right to
ask people who believe ar-15 should be
banned if they know what AR stands for
and many people will say yeah it stands
for assault rifle 15 which is wrong AR
stands for light Armalite the company
that made the first of that style right
I don't think this anymore yes that's
correct but it doesn't matter right I
mean the article is very good because it
points out that it doesn't matter
whether you know what AR stands for you
can still think that it should be a
weapon that is or isn't banned right and
it's a very very interesting article
that someone posted to our subreddit and
I encourage you to check it out and you
can participate in all of these great
discussions at david pakman.com slash
read it it's been a while since we had a
successful or I guess even attempted
if you're in our audience you know that
I've been covering the Trump Russia
story on the program for a while I've
covered events related to Russian
interference in the 2016 election
possible coordination between Russia and
members of the Trump administration it's
news it's worth discussing on a program
that deals with American politics and
I've made every effort to cover it in a
way that doesn't make unreasonable
assumptions or where I act like I know
things that we just don't yet know in
other words I try to make clear what is
fact what is speculation and what is
circumstantial and if you watch the show
you know that for a long time I've been
getting emails from a contingent of the
audience that questions a range of the
topics that relate to Trump and Russia
what's my justification for believing
this what do I think about that so I
thought it would be good to sort of sort
through and do a rundown of the facts
regarding everything Trump Russia and
how all of this informs my outlook on
the entire story this is more or less a
response to people who deny certain
indisputable facts but also people who
say that certain speculations are
totally baseless so let's start by
laying out four things that I solidly
believe to be true number one Russia
interfered in our election in 2016 that
is undeniable whether they flipped the
results is another story number two
there are some currently known facts
directly supporting the notion that
there was collusion between the Trump
campaign and Russia certain facts
already definitively tell us this for
sure but the evidence is limited at this
time number three given an entire array
of other facts about countless other
matters any reasonable person should be
able to admit at this point that it
would be miraculous if there turned out
to be no other coordination between the
Russian government and the Trump
campaign in addition to what we already
know and number four and this might be
the most important point denialism about
Trump Russia by default should be put on
hold until the investigations have
concluded and the findings of gone
public journalists of
members of the public don't have the
legal authority that Congress the FBI
and other intelligence agencies have to
dig for evidence we can very reasonably
assume that there is a ton of deeply
relevant knowledge about all of this
that's just not in the hands of the
public yet and claims that there was no
collusion or that there is no evidence
of collusion or meaningless as long as
all that information is still behind
closed doors and by the same token no
one should make definitive pointed
claims about there being collusion yet
either in the context that there is not
yet enough evidence all I can do is talk
about what we know and give what I
believe to be justified interpretations
of each piece of the puzzle so let's
start with what we know
starting with Russian interference in
the 2016 presidential election amazingly
there are somehow still some people who
deny or have doubts that Russia even
interfered in the election at all
including our president but there are
some pretty obvious reasons why Trump
wouldn't want to admit any of it so
let's start by recreating that timeline
in September of 2015 the FBI called the
DNC to tell them that their servers had
been compromised by hackers affiliated
with the Russian government and the FBI
said it was the same group of Kremlin
connected hackers who had for years been
hacking the White House and State
Department and the DNC basically blew
off the warning in April of 2016 the
server attacks became more apparent to
the DNC and their top officials were
alerted for the first time and they
hired private independent cybersecurity
firm CrowdStrike to investigate who also
independently determined that the DNC
was attacked by hackers affiliated with
the Russian government in June of 2016
the DNC told the public they were hacked
by the Russian government and the next
day an anonymous person online calling
themself
gute referred to point O came forward
and said now CrowdStrike is wrong it
wasn't Russia who hacked the DNC it was
me and I'm just a random Romanian guy
with no connection to Russia I hacked
the DNC to expose the Illuminati gucchy
fur also posted authentic DNC documents
which proves that gucchy fur at some
point had access to DNC servers or
affiliated with someone that did and
cybersecurity experts in US Intel have
said that Gucci fur was likely a false
flag created by Russian intelligence to
deflect blame and this wouldn't be the
first time that Russia has created a
fake loan hacker to divert blame for
their hacks and Gucci fur discredited
themself in a number of ways which
supports the notion that Gucci fur is
acting on behalf of the Russian
government there is reasonable
justification for assuming that Gucci
fur is a Russian invention but even if
Gucci fur is Romanian and it happened
that Gucci fur was inside the DNC's
computer systems at the same time as the
Russians gucci furs identity doesn't
change the conclusions of the US
intelligence and several private
cybersecurity firms
that the DNC was also hacked by cozy
bear and fancy bear to hacking groups
known to be tied to the Kremlin and
famous for hacking Russia's adversaries
so back to the timeline over the course
of June 2016 crowd strikes conclusions
that the DNC was hacked by those two
Russian groups are corroborated by other
private independent cybersecurity firms
including threat Kinect SecureWorks and
Fidelis cybersecurity July of 2016 three
days before the start of the Democratic
National Convention
WikiLeaks publishes tens of thousands of
hack DNC emails gucchy first said this
was going to happen the emails humiliate
the Clinton campaign humiliate the DNC
and lead to the resignation of the DNC's
chair CEO CFO and communications
director it is clear that those who were
responsible for this were only
interested in making the DNC look bad
and hurting Hillary Clinton's chances of
winning the election Julian Assange has
denied that Russia was his source for
leaks but Asajj might not even know who
gave him the documents and let's keep in
mind that Assange used to have his own
TV show on russian outlet RT and we know
that Assange has long disliked Hillary
Clinton and Assange was recently caught
haphazardly offering opposition research
on a Democratic US senator to someone
who was
to be Sean Hannity on Twitter so it's no
secret that both Russia and Julian
Assange have it out for the Democratic
Party in October of 2016 the Department
of Homeland Security and the Office of
the Director of National Defense
released a joint statement the US
intelligence community is confident that
the Russian government directed the
recent compromises of emails from US
persons and institutions including from
US political organizations we believe
based on the scope and sensitivity of
these efforts that only Russia's senior
most officials could have authorized
these activities next month in November
two days before Election Day thousands
of more hacked DNC emails were published
and clearly whoever coordinated the
hacking and the publishing of the DNC
emails chose to time things out in a way
that would be most damaging to the
Democratic Party and the Clinton
campaign also in November of 2016 NSA
director and commander of the US Cyber
Command Mike Rogers blame the Russian
government and attributes motive quote
there shouldn't be any doubt in anyone's
mind this was a conscious effort by a
nation-state to attempt to achieve a
specific effect in December of 2016 the
CIA tells the Senate that it's quite
clear that people connected to the
Kremlin hack the DNC and interfered with
the 2016 election specifically with the
purpose of helping Donald Trump win a
week later u.s. and foreign intelligence
officials tell ABC News that Putin was
personally involved in the DNC hacks and
other efforts to interfere with the 2016
election these anonymous US and foreign
officials say that they were directly
involved in tracking the hacks January 6
2017 the CIA FBI and Office of the
Director of National Intelligence
release a joint public statement saying
they've concluded with high confidence
that the Russian government hack DNC
emails and published them through
WikiLeaks with the goal of helping Trump
get elected and that all of this was
directly ordered by Vladimir Putin in
February of this year Trump's
Secretary of State tacitly admitted that
Russia interfered in the 2016 election
by hacking so you can't just say oh it's
all Obama's Intel people who are
manufacturing hysteria around Russian
hacking it wasn't just Obama appointed
people in Intel making these claims
before this anyway and also in February
of this year Jeanette Mann freh who's
the head of cyber security at DHS
confirmed that not only did Russia
target voting systems in 21 states which
we already knew but that Russia
succeeded in at least some of those
instances she said that these hacks no
doubt came from the Russian government
Russia also recruited an army of trolls
and BOTS to influence public opinion via
social media which is supported by a
mountain of academic research journalism
testimony in Congress and criminal
indictments that's probably the least
controversial truth in all of this so
I'm not even going to waste more time on
that Russia is well known for hacking
and otherwise trying to interfere with
the affairs of adversarial government's
political parties and elections
why wouldn't they try to do this here in
the US and 2016 in order to help a
presidential candidate that has been
conspicuously sympathetic to Russian
interests at every stage of the election
you can say I'm a shill for the
Democratic Party or a shill for
corporate media or whatever other
nonsense you want to say many of the
people who say those things about me may
not be aware that I am constantly
extremely critical of the DNC and the
Democratic Party on this program I do
not defend the DNC in their corruption
I don't defend what was found in their
leaked emails or their treatment of
Bernie Sanders during the election I
come to you as someone without a dog in
this fight as someone who doesn't pull
punches when it comes to Democrats in
the DNC and I will be the first to admit
that outlets like MSNBC and The
Huffington Post maybe are guilty of some
of that but what we've got to understand
is that many Bernie Sanders supporters
have a grudge against the DNC for their
treatment
Berni so they want to believe that the
email leaks were righteous and
coordinated by good-faith actors I'm a
Bernie supporter with some of those same
grudges but I'm not gonna let that blind
me from what the evidence points to
which is that Russia was responsible for
hacking and leaking the DNC documents
and emails and totally understandably
many Trump fans also don't want to
believe Russia hack the DNC because they
don't want to believe that Trump had an
unfair advantage in the election and
they definitely don't want to believe
that the Trump campaign may have had
knowledge or involvement with Russian
interference in the election a plot by
the US intelligence community and the
private cybersecurity industry and the
press to falsely blame the hacks on
Russia would be a much bigger and far
less believable conspiracy than Russians
hacking Democrats both Democratic and
Republican members of Congress agree
that Russia hacked the DNC and
influenced the election in other ways
Republicans want to deny almost
everything about Trump Russia but
they've had a lot of trouble denying
that no one can ignore what motivations
Russia would have for doing this no one
can ignore Russia's horrible
relationship with the Obama
administration and regardless of whether
there was Trump Russia collusion it's
impossible to deny that Trump implicitly
and explicitly was going to be a more
Pro Russia president than Hillary
Clinton and Russia is almost certainly
very interested in making the u.s. look
stupid to the world which by the way has
been another result of Trump's victory
and Russia succeeded in making our
electoral process seem vulnerable and
disordered they had every reason to try
to tip the election in trumps favor
because it was a win win win for Russia
as far as collusion between the Trump
campaign and the Russian government like
I said very little is known right now
but we have to reserve most of our
judgments for when the facts come out
facts that at this point in time are in
the possession only of the Justice
Department and the congressional
intelligence committees here's one
instance
of apparent collusion between the Trump
campaign and the Russian government that
we know about at least an attempt at
collusion June 9th of 2016 Donald Trump
jr. Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort
literally the head of the campaign met
with a Kremlin connected Russian lawyer
for the purpose of receiving dirt on
Hillary Clinton before the meeting Trump
jr. was informed via email that this
dirt was part of a Kremlin plot to help
Donald Trump less than a week earlier
Trump jr. received an email from an
intermediary representing a senior
Russian government official and Trump
jr. knew he was talking to someone
representing the Russian government the
email to Trump jr. said in part quote
this would incriminate Hillary and her
dealings with Russia and would be very
useful to your father
this is obviously very high-level and
sensitive information but as part of
Russia and its government support for
mr. Trump Donald Trump's jr. response
was if it's what you say I love it
especially later in the summer the
intermediary wrote back to set up Trump
juniors meeting with a Russian attorney
the Russian attorney Natalya Veselin
that skaia is well known for her work on
behalf of the Russian government to
advocate for the lifting of US sanctions
on Russia the Trump team and the Russian
lawyer did not just sit around talking
about the weather that day and long
after the fact Donald Trump jr. was
caught lying about the meeting not only
is this attempted collusion with the
Russian government but it might violate
federal law which states a foreign
national shall not directly or
indirectly make a contribution or a
donation of money or another thing of
value or expressly or impliedly promised
to make a contribution or a donation in
connection with any federal state or
local election it shall be unlawful for
a person to solicit accept or receive a
thing of value from a foreign national
and by the way this is just totally
secondary Steve Bannon later said that
the chances of those Trump campaign
officials not introducing the
representatives from russia to trump
while they were in Trump Tower are zero
and when I say that this was a 10
did collusion I'm not saying for sure
that it was only an attempt but I'm
saying it was at minimum an attempt the
Trump team could have been very
successful in colluding with Russia that
day but all we know for certain is that
there was an attempt and you can write
this off as no big deal but 90% of what
matters in this particular situation is
intent so let's talk about people
associated with the Trump campaign you
have to be naive to dismiss what we know
about the president's associates the
people that he and his campaign chose to
become involved with and their
connections to Russia their criminal
histories in some cases their blatant
desperate attempts to lie about and
cover up their dealings with the
Russians both during and after the
campaign Michael Flynn by the time he
was hired as a top adviser to the Trump
campaign was already known for his close
ties to the Russian government and had
been criticized for it by people from
all over the political spectrum when
illegally lied to the US government
about money he had received from the
Russian government Flynn spoke to
Russian ambassador kis lyac several
times during the Trump transition and
lied about it one of those calls was on
the same day the Obama administration
announced sanctions on Russia and Flynn
was forced to basically admit that US
sanctions were discussed during the call
Jared Kushner during the Trump
transition discussed with Russian
ambassador kis lyac the possibility of
using a Russian consulate to set up a
secret and secure communications channel
between the Trump team and the Kremlin
in order to hide their conversations
from American intelligence this was at a
meeting between Kushner and kis lyac at
the beginning of December of 2016 at
Trump Tower Jared Kushner has also lied
to the US government about meetings he
had with Russians Trump campaign manager
Paul Manafort has a long history of both
criminal activity and loyalty to Russia
from oh six 209 he was paid ten million
dollars a year by Putin oligarch Oleg
Deripaska to secretly help influence
politics media and business in the US
and Europe to benefit
Russia and for nearly a decade mana fort
was paid to manipulate Ukrainian
politics to benefit Russia which
involved receiving laundered Ukrainian
tax dollars stolen by pro-russian
politicians in Ukraine mana fort
currently faces federal charges in the
u.s. including conspiracy against the
United States money-laundering not
registering as a foreign agent and lying
to the FBI because of intercepted
communications and payments from Russia
during the Trump transition mana Ford
has been under investigation
for the past year by several US
intelligence and law enforcement
agencies and was the subject of FBI
wiretaps before during and after the
2016 election two weeks before the
Republican National Convention mana Ford
offered private briefings on the
election to Putin oligarch Oleg
Deripaska mana Ford said in the email if
he needs private briefings we can
accommodate and again this is another
example of what we have to wait and find
out about before we go dismissing these
emails are among tens of thousands of
communications and documents that the
FBI has that the public does not but
mana Ford is a confirmed person of
interest in the do J's Trump Russia
investigation Trump campaign advisor
Michael Caputo had previously worked on
a Russian propaganda campaign in the
u.s. to improve Russia's image among
Americans Trump campaign adviser Jeff
Sessions had to recuse himself from his
own Trump Russia investigation after it
was discovered that he lied about
meetings he had with Russia's ambassador
to the u.s. Trump campaign advisor
Carter page has a long history with the
Russian government and is also under FBI
investigation and he's known among his
peers as an outspoken critic of US
foreign policy and a strong Putin
sympathizer Paige has been known for
making public comments in Russia
criticizing the US and praising Putin a

I've got some video for you that I've
deliberately not watched yet but I'm
gonna describe to you what I know about
the video and then we'll watch it and
listen to it together Michael Wolff is
the author of the book about the Donald
Trump white house fire and fury the book
is very controversial it has some
material in it that we know to be true
because it's been widely independently
corroborated other material in the book
that is questionable and uncorroborated
and very very salacious in any case he
still has been doing some interviews he
was speaking to Ben Fordham from The
Today Show on Australia's channel nine
about his book and at a certain point he
was asked about the sometimes alleged
affair between now ambassador to the UN
former South Carolina Governor nikki
Haley and Donald Trump and lo and behold
as soon as he was asked to ask that
question he could no longer hear the
interviewer but it's kind of weird
because I've used as you've described it
to me Pat yes he seems to be able to
very clearly hear the questions about
whether he can hear the questions yeah
like if I couldn't hear you right now
we'd probably be talking over each other
yeah that would be very clear he seems
to wait until the interview was done
asking his question before he responds
right so let's take a look at it and see
if we can figure out what's going on to
an intractable problem and that's what
he came up with let's give every teacher
a gun you said during a TV interview
just last month that you are absolutely
sure that Donald Trump is currently
having an affair while president behind
the back of the first lady and I'll
repeat you said you were absolutely sure
huh just last week power and you
backflipped
and said I quote I do not know if the
president is having an affair do you owe
the president and the first lady an
apology mr. wolf I can't hear you
just last month you said you were
absolutely sure that the president was
having an affair and now you say I'm not
getting anything you're not hearing me
mr. wolf
I'm not getting anything we were hearing
each other well just before you're not
hearing me I still wolf do you deal here
I'm not mr. wolf was hearing me before
but he's not hearing me anymore so
unless you anything the interview may be
over Michael Wolf's book fire and fury
inside the Trump White House is out now
and he is about to take off on a
speaking to us so I think we will leave
it there it was an unfortunate question
to miss wasn't it Oh God yeah I I don't
know as a thing it does appear like he's
got a couple points he does talk over
the interviewer but the precision with
which everything is fine and we could
still hear Michael Michael Wolff it's
just weird
it's weird how suddenly he just couldn't
hear anything and immediately took off
his earpiece and left I think there's
one telltale sign which is when the
interviewer asks him you're not hearing
me mr. wolf and he starts to say no and
then he goes on with something else
yeah I was about to say the word no
right which you can't really answer if
you say actually here the guy what let's
speculate about the motive for why he
wouldn't want to talk about this I mean
is it just because he did at one point
say nikki Haley and Trump are having an
affair and then he backed off of it and
he doesn't want to have to kind of
answer a question about like well what
else are you backing off of or is there
more to it I don't even I mean there
those are big allegations that the
president's having an affair yeah Nikki
Haley's having an affair and he can't
back them up and so it makes the
credibility of the entire book go out
the window yeah I guess so it is very
very awkward video and I've been in
those situations where I'm sitting in a
room and it's sometimes the audio goes
out you know so it's true sometimes it
happens it's just I'm going to think
about whether I'd be acting in the way
Michael wolf was acting if the audio
went out I don't think I'd get up so
quickly I would just sort of like a suit
some tech person will fix it and then
like the interview will resume or
continue that's the weirdest part for me
who gets up and walks away
yeah who's asking the technician if he
could hear the end right where I don't
know if Michael Wolfe has bad hearing
but why would the technician be able to
hear him but not Michael Wolfe himself a
technician has his own ear
Pease and presumably the technician
could I think is monitoring the entire
fee handing over the year pierced your
earpiece though he was handing it to us
oh I thought that yeah technician might
have had his own earpiece yeah I don't
know what happened but it's very funny
and you said that he was on Morning Joe
and this topic came up
yeah and they essentially kicked him off
mika brzezinski was not having it like
she liked when he alleged the affair
Meeker said we're done yeah or Mika
asked him a question about the affair
after they had a conversation about
other allegations yeah look and once
once they got to that topic Mika said
all right we're gonna put your entire
credibility on this question and then
she asked about the alleged affair
between nikki Haley and Trump yeah and
he was just doing his thing where he's
kind of backpedaling not really
answering the question not being direct
about it huh you know trying to get away
with making the claim without having to
back it up and I think that's what he's
been doing all along is it sort of like
he's saying he has sources that have
told him this but like he hasn't seen
from Ben nikki Haley having sex
personally exactly and it's all back is
always that you can read the book for
yourself
and determine what's true and what's not
true but that's the big problem with
that I have with this book is like how
am i as the reader without any footnotes
or any actions supposed to be supposed
to decipher what's true and what's not
true I don't know I the book it's sort
of petered out hasn't it well I think he
made a lot of money from it yeah I mean
I was sure I wanted to read it when it
initially came out yeah yeah now I could
have access to it but I don't really
care anymore I think the credibility is
just not there interesting
yeah all right well I'm much more
interested in the corroboration of the
Steele dossier than the Michael Wolfe
book to be perfectly honest and we're
seeing more and more corroboration of
that okay uber and lyft are now starting
to really impact traffic in a pretty
significant way a number of studies have
been done now measuring the impact
including here in the Boston area of
ride-hailing services and a lot of the
studies are asking people were this not
available what would you have used
instead right because if you're using
uber or lyft instead of driving a car
yourself that's not really much of a
change or you could argue that if 10
people decide to take an uber lyft and
leave their cars at home that that
improves traffic but overwhelmingly
people are using uber or lyft instead of
public
transportation and that is not so good
because that is putting way more cars
onto the roads
I'm not hugely surprised by this we've
talked for a while about how clearly you
are putting a lot of cars onto the road
when you are using ride hailing services
like this to such a degree I don't know
what the solution ultimately is going to
be to that yeah I think people had the
idea in their head that uber and lyft
would complement public transportation
because maybe you would get them to the
bus stop get them to the train station
that's right if you're gonna call an
uber why not just take it to your entire
destination why do I have multiple steps
I don't I guess you're willing to call
it you know it would be cost why someone
would over to a bus and then take the
bus but depending on where you are if
the uber is five bucks to the bus and
the bus is another two dollars meaning
it's seven dollars versus just taking a
twelve dollar ooh BRR so for five extra
bucks you go the whole way in the car a
lot of people are going to choose to go
the whole way in the car not everybody
right five bucks a day adds up over time
but a lot of people are going to choose
to go the whole way so yeah it's not
working out the way some thought which
is people are gonna use this to
facilitate more others other forms of
public transit especially because you're
saving time you don't have to deal with
50 stinky people on the bus yeah I mean
you're probably the only person in the
car unless you're using that uber pool
thing if you were pool now they have
another one called uber Express I don't
really use uber I use lyft but they have
another one I think called uber Express
which is like uber pool but it actually
tells people all to walk a few blocks to
one pickup point huh and then the car
swings by and that's to prevent some of
the driving around gathering different
okay so you don't have to go down the
specific side streets and you can stay
on main roads so the car doesn't have to
go down side streets and people do but
you have to go and walk somewhere some
kind of central meeting point yeah I
think like my usage of uber and lyft and
now I'm really just on lyft it's pretty
limited but it's instead of public
transit because the way I work things is
if there's parking that is sort of
predictably reliable I will usually take
my car except in places like downtown
Boston where it's like 20 bucks an hour
to park and I'm just not going to do
that but for the most part if I know
that parking is relative like if there's
a meter or a municipal lot I will
usually take my car
and if it's an area I don't want to take
my car - I will typically take the
subway in Boston there's a lot of areas
that the subway doesn't really connect
that well so I might have to take a
subway to a bus and if I'm going with
like my girlfriend and I'm thinking okay
so I'm you or something it's gonna be
275 each so we're talking about 550 and
for 8 bucks we can just get an uber and
go straight there and sometimes a
quarter of the time I often will go with
the the lyft not the uber rather so yeah
for me it's instead of public transit
not instead of driving yeah I use it
every now and then what I hate though is
when you're driving and you see someone
pulled over with their hazards but we're
really pulled over there give me your
fill in the street they're blocking the
lanes Boston's very busy a lot of parked
cars on the sides of the road there's
often bike lanes - yeah and they just
block it and I don't mean me maybe taxi
drivers do it
taxi drivers do it too much more often
with ubers and lyft's it's insufferable
and the double parking in Boston is
absolutely horrifying the police
basically do nothing about it and I'm
sure the police will say no we do do
things about it we just can't get
everybody it's it's bad it's really
really bad and it's it's I can't stand
that I always give them a few honks as
they drive by oh that's got a principle
yeah absolutely agree with that because
honking solves lots of it does okay
let's talk about children writing I've
noticed that now that I do most of my
sort of taking language and putting it
into written form with a computer
keyboard that when I do have to write a
bunch my hand gets really tired and
cramps up like remember when you were a
kid and you would get an exam Journal
those little blue books and you would
have to write an entire exam and by page
five six seven or eight I would be
pretty damn tired my hand would be
cramping my fingers would hurt
apparently now because of the extent to
which kids are not writing with pencils
or pens and doing tablet and typing
stuff kids are basically have completely
underdeveloped
physical writing muscles and even a
little bit of writing now is really
affecting the ability of kids to focus
on what they're supposed to be learning
because the hand muscles are so weak in
the hand
so much and it hurts yeah I think it's
the soy yeah I mean I don't hold the
pencil correctly you don't hold it
correctly you're supposed to like put
three fingers at the bottom right I
always just kind of crunch it yeah I'm
like this because I taught myself how to
write when I was really young and I
never learned the proper way
yeah that's do that I don't think I ever
nobody told me how to hold a pencil but
I basically I'm showing the the audience
how it is that I hold it and I probably
have my first second and third fingers
in a sort of I'd call it like a pincer
and that is how I hold the pen or pencil
how would you describe this one I would
call that the claw although a pincer and
a claw is not necessarily that different
that's how I do it
yeah this I mean listen this is not
hugely surprising I actually don't think
this is as big a deal as some people are
making it out to be because think about
for example in a time where people had
to chop their own wood much more
frequently the muscles that are
activated when chopping wood with a hand
axe would be much more developed than in
people now since people mostly aren't
chopping wood to provide Heat on a
day-to-day basis those muscles are
drastically underdeveloped but like it's
not a crisis in the sense that you don't
need those muscles in 2018 yeah most
parts so like is this a big deal or not
to some extent because you'll still need
handwriting in the real world I think
even going forward we're not going to be
entirely using tablets I don't know the
other thing is that there is a brain
hand connection that goes on when you're
writing sometimes down if you want to
learn something like a list of
vocabulary words it's one thing to see
it on a tablet it's another thing to
write it down yourself
oh I don't disagree yeah I mean you got
to teach that maybe you ought to teach
like cursive anymore but handwriting we
do we've talked about the cursive thing
before actually yeah is there any is
there any sort of like used used to
cursive at this point I think as far as
the writing thing I have made it a habit
any nonfiction I read that's more dense
I will underline and make little notes
because I do find it to increase my
retention now will I ever go back and
look at what I underlined I don't know
I really don't know I mean I think like
if I was preparing a segment for the
show about something related to a topic
I had read about I might pull out the
book and it might be if I looked through
it I might notice what I had underlined
and that might be useful to me but for
me it's more of like a and it enables me
to better assimilate ideas I think yeah
underlining but that's not really
writing well I do that whenever I read a
nonfiction book I'll write down the key
words that I want to learn because I
understand that later on I'll remember
the concepts yeah nice to know what the
actual term is to use it in conversation
whatever you what I'm done using I'm
done reading the book I'll go back and
like to find those words and make it up
there in my head yeah and then process
does someone give you like a vocabulary
quiz afterwards like are you doing the
full thing no one's volunteered but yeah
I'd like to volunteer we could do that
yeah all right so listen
kids are having trouble writing because
they're not really having to write as
much and I do think there is still
utility to this I don't know that I'm on
board with you that we will always be
writing by hand forever I think we're
increasingly moving in the direction I
mean even most contracts now are being
signed digitally like most about ad
deals I get something a PDF and I sign
it and send it back on the computer you
thinking about like art though I mean I
understand yeah of course there's
digital art now and there's graphic
design yeah but there's something to
just paint it there's or like even
reading a book I know we're going on a
trend now towards ebooks
yep indels that sort of thing but I like
having the physical book in my hand it
might give to you as well I do too and
when I tell people that I'm not on a
Kindle and that I'm actually acquiring
paper books and like I have a library of
books more and more people are looking
at me like wait a second so you're you
believe in climate change and you want
to help the environment but you're
buying stuff written on dead trees and
accumulating it why like why not just
get one device and I it's just hard for
me to imagine sitting in bed at night
reading a Kindle and maybe it's just a
matter of getting accustomed to it like
lots of other things I don't know if not
our generation maybe the next or the one
after that probably that's that what
happens then my little sister who's 20
years younger than me she still reads
physical books so it's not
it probably will happen but if I'm
resistant you'll be the resistor I will
absolutely all right we'll talk to you
next week
the david pakman show at david
pakman.com
[Music]
for today's classic interview I'm
actually going to refuse to give you
much of an introduction to it other than
to tell you we did not agree on policy
when I spoke to Charles Butler and he
believed that I was a girly man an
assertion that was unusual at least as
far as interviews are concerned let's
get to my interview from December of
2014 with Charles Butler this week's
classic interview I'm joined today by
Charles Butler he is a nationally
syndicated talk show host also a
financial adviser Charles it's really
great to have you on I've been listening
to your program I listened to the
December 11th show that show was a doozy
you were responding to the Senate
torture report you had a lot to say and
one thing that caught my ear and and
that's kind of where I want to start
today is you thought that Senator Dianne
Feinstein from California should be
punched why why did you come to that
conclusion well you know she heard the
only reason that she released that port
that report was for political reasons
and unfortunately David we have too many
people who are grandstanding and playing
with people's lives
she has endangered the lives of real
citizens of real patriots dr. Mitchell
said he's received death threats you
know these people do not play we know
that al-qaeda Osama bin Laden and his
life the Taliban they are killing
Americans these people are receiving
death threats because of her
unclassified information and that's why
the CIA has always sought to hide
information from Congress because of
people like Dianne funds so you're
saying you're okay with the report that
said that the CIA was lying about the
extent to which they were using these
techniques because you think it's the
right thing to do to hide that no I
don't think it's the right thing to do
to hide that but I don't think it's
anyone's business outside of it's
classified information what we do and
the facts are talking to all the people
who were involved in on the CIA side is
that they briefed Congress they briefed
Feinstein they briefed Rockefeller they
briefed all these Democrats and
Republicans also said that they were
briefed so Feinstein and the Democrats
are blatantly lied
so you said that Dianne Feinstein should
be punched what other circumstances do
you advocate physical violence against
women I don't you know I don't make that
distinction about women and in violence
see that's kind of a European you know
chivalry thing and at the end of the day
it's BS because women are out here
fighting men you see it you see it in
the movies today where women are
attacking men and like that video with
Ray Rice his wife clearly came back
across the elevator with her fist balled
up and he had a reaction he didn't punch
it once or twice he just just stuck out
his fist and jab to keep alright but so
but without getting on to that you so
you're comfortable in other words
advocating physical violence against
Dianne Feinstein who happens to be a
woman I don't care who she is if if
she's in the kitchen and she needs to
play the game and at the end of the day
what Dianne Feinstein's done a punches
is the minimum that should happen to her
but this woman because she's a senator
she has said she wants to she well she's
going to get people killed
so when you compare a punch to getting
people killed David you know you can
play that game oh it's no game I'm just
trying to figure out what your level of
comfort is advocating for violence my
level of comfort is simply this it's not
advocating he putting words in my mouth
I'm not advocating anything well I say
she should be punched presumably someone
should do the punch to right her face
yep they put these women they put these
women in positions of responsibility and
and of power and what does she do she's
playing games with peoples live yes you
use that term these women and I know
you've said we should actually have
fewer women in the Senate so why is why
should we have fewer women and just so
the audience knows women make up
slightly more than 50% of the population
they make up 20% of the Senate you think
there's too many women in the Senate why
is what now let me ask you this now
Charles before you go into that let me
just make sure my question is clear you
just said you don't make recommendations
or
statements based on gender in other
words you don't care whether you're
saying a woman or man deserves to be
punched you don't care about gender but
at the same time you're saying there
should be fewer women in the Senate so
you are actually concerned with gender
yeah that's because Dianne Feinstein if
you look at if you go back when do your
research David which I'm sure you'll do
Dianne Feinstein came out this summer
and said that we need more women in the
Senate because we're more collegiate oh
we get along we get things done that was
Diane Feinstein who say that not Charles
Butler well but there are there are
actual studies that show that women do
have a tendency to build rapport and
work together and and that that's
actually based in science though this
country in the world has worked
perfectly well with men doing what they
need to do and working together and
there's no other there's no other place
than the military that I look at where
men get together work very effectively
together in an all-male environment
without the female influence so well you
discount those studies don't Lee okay
and on what basis have you decided how
when you see that how do you decide when
a study is valid and when it isn't is it
just based on your preconceived notions
no because of the people because of the
people doing the studies when you have
these girly men who are sitting back
doing studies like well we need women on
the football field and we need women
doing this and we we don't need women
doing anything is there their
environments where that whole male
camaraderie is really important just
like let me let me just say this since
you put on their track please I I detest
the fact that women think that they can
get together and exclude men but
whenever we have an exclusive group it
needs to be feminized we need to have
submit some females in an all-male group
and you know I don't believe that we
should there are times we should have
all-male groups all-female groups I'm
for separate education for women it's
studies have shown that women who were
in all-girl environments do better in
science and math than weather study is
wet which studies are those those are
studies they're out they just like the
studies you look
Golub dosa shows a surcharge by the
government they're done by universities
and those studies have said the same
thing that girls do better in science
when they're in all-girl environments
okay so it's you we're gonna get back to
you want fewer women in the Senate but
you also have a problem with girly men
how to do studies what does that mean
though how who's a girly man well you
know there are a lot of there are a lot
of feminine males out here a David and
so you want to try to put words in my
mouth and I want to allow you to do that
well hold on a second hold on a second
but Charles that use you use the term we
don't need girly men doing Studies and I
simply I simply repeated that back to
you so what was it I put in your mouth
you try to sit I advocate I did not use
that word let me be very clear please I
am NOT I do not advocate for men
or men like Barack Obama in leadership
positions or men like a Boehner in
leadership positions men who obviously
have not served in the military have not
proven themselves as their male but I
they men how can they make hard you said
you say the answer has been absolutely
not okay so but this this is really the
meat of it and I hope you'll indulge me
in this when you talk about a man
we heard one characteristic which is
they have not served in the military how
else does Charles Butler define a
man I define a man by a guy who
saw a guy who has no commitment a guy
who who in many ways hasn't done
anything in his life but sit back and
push paper and sit behind a desk okay so
let me get let me that's very good so
Charles an accountant or lawyer who
never served in the military by your
definition that's a man right
no no they're they're actions that have
to be involved there are accountants and
they are lawyers who are warriors who
believe in fighting you look at and
people like Thurgood Marshall he never
served in the military he was certainly
a warrior you look at Charles Houston he
was certainly a warrior
but they fall under the definition you
just gave me for what a man is
they have not served in the military and
they push papers well that's included in
that definition so we're expanding that
definition let's do it but you can't so
that you can't that's we're gonna we're
gonna you know jocular here we gotta go
you know Jackie Jimmy here I'm just
going to expand that definition please
so what else is included in the
definition there's pushing paper and not
being in the military what else do we
have number things if you don't know
what a girly man is then you know Arnold
Schwarzenegger was very clear about
girly men wasn't he yes but but teach me
I'm too low that would be my definition
the Arnold Schwarzenegger definition of
girly man that would be my definition
okay I'm getting the sense you don't
really know what that definition was but
means because see there they are girlie
men out here yeah they're sissies and
and they're males but they're certainly
not men okay so you agree all right
that's fine perfect so let's go back to
the women in the Senate twenty women in
the Senate out of a hundred slightly
more than 50% of the population is made
up of women you are fewer women in the
Senate why right like Dianne Feinstein
because your collegiate Co and they
don't understand and Barbara Boxer and I
can go down the list Elizabeth Warren
yeah people who don't understand what
this country needs in order to move
forward here you but then Charles
question for you and I asked this
completely honestly if you first said
you don't care about gender women men if
they don't like hold on a second let me
let me get the question out and then if
you disagree with the framing of it
you'll I'll allow you to tell me you
first said you don't use gender as a
basis on which to analyze whether
someone should or shouldn't have
something happen to them etc no but hold
on Charles hold on judge please let me
just get the question out okay you were
talking about Feinstein yeah yeah then
you said you would like to see fewer
women in the Senate but when I asked you
why you want fewer women
the Senate you gave a definition that
could apply to men or women in other
words the way and so there's why is it
that you want fewer women in this
because the women that I have seen
American women in this who enter
politics yes especially the American
women that we have in politics today
like Hillary Clinton you know they don't
quite measure up you notice how they
don't quite measure up to the foreign
women like Golda Meir they don't measure
up to to Maggie Thatcher or even Andrea
Merkel have you noticed that I have not
no I haven't noticed but but what did
Hillary Clinton want to do the first
thing she said was all the guys are
picking on me see American women this is
gets back to my initial point why I
don't differentiate between punching a
girl or punching a guy yeah you know
people put themselves in that position
and I think that you have to deal with
whatever position comes along because in
my culture women will kick your behind
now where you say your culture what do
you what is that what is your culture
black women will fight you they will
fight you like a man and if you don't
fight back if you don't defend yourself
you're going to get will and people mean
we laugh about it all the time like
everybody this whole Ray Rice thing I
was listening to Marshall Faulk at a
golf outing that he played and he played
our force and we won the tournament by
the way but he was very clear about how
he felt that Ray Rice was being
railroaded he was he's been denigrated
his wife even said well I attacked him
which she did but you know the white
media the white girlie media with these
all these girls well he punched her out
he didn't go over and attack her he
didn't jump on her when she was pushing
the button he he hit her she responded
she came across the you know that's
interesting so what you're saying is
that you feel that there are specific
characteristics to what you've called as
your culture black culture which with
regard to the Ray Rice
janay rice domestic violence situation
right media didn't portray that taking
into consideration and understand a
better understanding of black cultures
that way
saying I'm saying that exactly and the
bottom line is black women will punch
you out they will fight that's in the
black culture and people know that we
know that we have limited time to
Terrell what very few white women will
engage you and punch or try to fight you
it's a totally different culture and
then and then when this witness uh the
NFL do they go higher for white women to
deal with the league that's 75 percent
black totally crazy it along the same
lines that having only twenty percent of
women in the Senate when half the
population as women is right I mean it's
the same thing we have a lack of
representation what I care about I don't
care about the population see that's a
girlie man you just watch Aras Charles
you just talked about the population you
said the population of the NFL is
seventy five percent women David they're
twenty percent blacks in the population
is anybody talking about the Senate
needs to be twenty percent black they
certainly should why shouldn't we have
what why don't we have why don't we have
a governing body that is representative
more or less of the population at large
it's not is I talk about that all the
time that's not I don't know what
happens on your show by the way when we
start talking about white women and
income disparity that's who they're
talking about they're not talking about
black women income disparity because
black women make less than white women
in the in the in the workplace I don't
know who I don't know who they is but I
talk about racial income disparities
okay hey I want to talk about something
else from your December 11th show and
this is a really serious thing you said
the lefties need to leave and they need
to experience Sharia law now this is a
really serious thing and I'm gonna allow
you to respond to this but just hear me
out because it's the American right the
American Christian Right whose positions
mirror those of Sharia law and I'll tell
you why and I know you won't agree and
I'll let you respond subjugation of
women homophobia anti-science xenophobia
willingness to go to violence very
quickly to achieve political goals which
themselves are informed by religion
wanting a theocratic government where
religion informs the law the line and
even the Pope has admitted this the line
between Sharia law and American
extremist right-wing Christians is a
pretty direct line isn't it Charles I
don't hear it's not everything that you
say it is absolutely false go point by
point hold on go point by point which of
the points well I don't have your notes
but if you emailed them over that I'd
have your notes to go by okay but hold
on Charles we can we can result you and
I can resolve this very very simply the
Sharia lies anti-gay and American
extremist Christians aren't is your
business I don't put it in my face and
it will never be it will never be
acceptable to me okay we're God so you
will but Sir Charles the Pope can't make
up Scripture so I don't care about this
Pope who forget the Pope okay but so you
agree but Charles let's this isn't
really important let's go piece by piece
the Pope okay you say the Pope may be a
homo that's fine let's go step by step
though so on the on the gay issue you
agree that Sharia and right-wing
Christians have the same view on that
one you do a group no I'm not agreeing
to that you just did though you said
yeah I'm anti gay Christians are
anti-gay you're drawing that connection
what I say it is that scripture says
that homosexuality is not is not is
immoral and that's that's my morality
okay so the scripture agrees the
scripture agrees okay the scripture
agrees with Sharia law those who agree
with Sharia law the scripture is the
scripture Christian scripture okay duis
rila Sharia law uses religion to inform
what is the judicial system in the same
way that American right-wing Christians
based on their scribbles hold on
Charlotte Charles hold on you got to let
me get the questions out though you've
got to let me get the question out in
the same way that Sharia law is Muslim
Scripture
the judicial system American right-wing
Christians want to use their scripture
to inform the judicial system for
example homosexuality being illegal
abortion being illegal the teaching of
creationism in public school so that's
another similarity right no you you know
what you do is mix apples and oranges no
but I'm not gonna allow you to sit here
and because judeo-christian law it
doesn't believe in homosexuality
nor does Buddha with Buddhism or
Hinduism
they all are anti-gay if that's what you
want to call it okay but I'm off that
point already I'm on the the use of
scripture to inform the law obviously
you have a pro liberal Pro gay agenda
that's fine but I'm not gonna allow you
to sit here
well the right way I'm not a right
winger okay but but if you're going to
say that what I'm saying is wrong if
you're not going to allow me then you
should explain to me why I'm wrong
rather than just saying you don't agree
well the thing that you've done and that
you that you've done is you want to have
talking points if you want to talk about
politics you want to talk about these
issues I don't have your talking points
in front of me so but we're deciding a
conversation there are no talking points
per se because obviously you know but
Charles the top one point stupid
Americans you talk to David Charles is
about back I was doing this long before
you were born problem so I don't know
what's that else to do with it though
the talking point is by what you say on
your show is that you sit here and you
try to put words and put your inflection
on what I said and what I mean I think
if anybody simply this and what I mean
is simply this there is no comparison in
my opinion right the right-wing
extremism and and and and Sharia law
okay that's fine I would I would have
loved it Charles and we are a time I
would have loved it if you had given us
data as to why they're different as
opposed to just saying you won't allow
me to connect it you would give it all
you have to do is
google it yeah and if you given me the
the talking point we were going to have
the topics I would have provided you
it's great to welcome to the program
today Andy weir who is the New York
Times bestselling author of the Martian
and more recently Artemis which I just
finished reading enjoyed it very very
much Andy I'm so glad to have you on you
have an interesting background in that
you really started working in tech you
were a programmer very very young you
worked as a software engineer how'd you
sort of start getting into the writing
of sci-fi uh well I just always wanted
to be a writer and I was always into
sci-fi I think I don't remember town
when I didn't want to write I mean I
used to write like fan fiction for
beverly cleary novels when I was six it
wasn't very good but you know I was
writing it and as for science fiction I
think I was indoctrinated at an early
age my dad's a sci-fi dork
and he had this infinite collection of
science fiction books from his youth so
I think I was doomed to sci-fi do you
remember what the authors were from your
dad's library that sort of pulled you
into the genre absolutely my Holy
Trinity so to speak our Isaac Asimov
Robert Heinlein and our through C Clark
those are the guys that I read a whole
bunch of and then there's also you know
there's a whole collection of authors
that dad had but those are the ones that
really reached out and grabbed me that
and that those views of the future that
just seemed really cool so you started
writing the Martian which has sort of an
interesting backstory where you were
releasing it a chapter at a time for
free on your website and it sort of
accumulated this initial audience when
you were releasing a chapter at a time
were you also writing it as you went and
sort of tailoring subsequent chapters to
the reaction well I was writing it as I
went along so when I released a chapter
I didn't have anything beyond that
written but I didn't tailor it
specifically to what the audience
reacted to what I did do though was I
would correct errors that my readers
found so it was nice I had like three
thousand fact-checkers and when you say
errors do you mean area errors in the
science for example yeah yeah in the
science
math yeah and my readers our site were
you know our science dorks these are my
this is back before I hit it big and so
my my readership was a an email list of
people who were like hardcore science
dorks writing is so interesting in that
there there's such an element of sort of
I don't know if it's luck but it's
certainly timing and place I'm reading
Nassim Taleb the Black Swan and he talks
about how writing in particular is one
of those areas where we often don't
think about sort of the silent evidence
or all of the incredible writing that we
never hear about and the Martian
arguably was close to that right I mean
it was by virtue of you deciding well
I'm not publishing this thing as a book
in the traditional way I'll start
putting it online it'll build an
audience and eventually that led to you
know Matt Damon acting in a movie called
the Martian how do you feel about sort
of how much circumstance plays into the
success it's had of course I mean like
I've got impostor syndrome up the wazoo
I I don't really know what I did right I
have no idea why my story became so
popular and others didn't it it struck a
nerve in some way and I didn't do it on
purpose I mean I thought I was writing
for this tiny tiny little niche audience
of hardcore science dorks who wanted to
see the math play out but I ended up
reaching a broad audience I think it's
one thing that I did was I I
accidentally found a niche of
scientifically accurate science fiction
the the hard sci-fi there's not a lot of
that out there nowadays and so for for
the demographic that likes the that
likes the science to be realistic turns
out that demographic is bigger than we
thought and then the and also mainly
because it's it is now novel because
there's so few other writers doing it
and then the other thing I think that I
did without meaning to was I'm a fairly
optimistic guy when it comes to science
and technology in the future and how
it'll affect us I mean I honestly
believe that humanity just keeps getting
better in
better I think that if you look at any
century in history and ask yourself
whether you'd want to live there or the
century before you would prefer the
later century which is kind of my my my
back of the napkin proof that humanity's
quality of life just keeps going up and
up we just keep getting better
so lately I think that science fiction
has been kind of hijacked by this dismal
dystopian view of the future where
everything's doom and gloom and
Technology all it does is make humanity
like suffer and first off I don't
subscribe to that theory I think it's
wrong and second off that that so my my
books that have like this aspirational
view of the future where the future will
be cool are rare because of it which is
funny because they were the norm back in
the 50s and 60s and those of the books I
read growing up I mean I am from the 70s
and 80s but I read my father's science
fiction collection and so back in that
those days you know that the birth of
contemporary science fiction with like
Heinlein Asimov and Clarke they were all
like the futures were awesome it was
like ooh you know traveling to the you
know other planets and there is just
everything's awesome they sort of right
I mean arthur c clarke had a lot of
pretty dystopian stuff you know Starship
Troopers is not exactly the most
beautiful view of the future I mean III
think it depends on which novels right
yeah fair enough fair enough but even
then it's like the you know earth itself
and like in Starship Troopers it's a war
yeah but earth itself is pretty awesome
right like yeah
what new science fiction do you find I
mean the dystopian novels are pretty
popular in the last you know five eight
of science fiction is there new sci-fi
that you're enjoying these days yeah
there is like I like Peter Klein's a lot
his is his novels tend to be like less
dystopian and more like more like
smaller scale like the scope which I
which is what I like I
III don't like world cracking in half I
like oh this guy and his friends have a
problem
and if they don't solve it they'll die
but the rest of the universe isn't going
to suffer you know that's one thing that
that's another thing that kind of bugs
me in science fiction is the concept of
scale like the notion that you know if I
make an action movie just a contemporary
action movie it can be about a guy
trying to save his family from
kidnappers right and that's it that's
fine you know that the United States is
not in danger you know or the city of
Chicago is not going to sink into the
into the lake right but if you make a
science fiction movie for some reason
there's this presumption that the entire
setting has to be relying on these
actions like you're not allowed to have
a small stakes story in science fiction
the whole universe has to be about to
get destroyed or something and that bugs
me III disagree with that as well
that's where the Martian is one man's
life is at stake that's it
it's not it's not like Oh God all of
humanity would all but know one guy he's
gonna die if he doesn't do things right
now interestingly in Artemis the your
newer novel it's a little bit higher
stakes right I mean I don't want to a
little bit give them everything and I
don't know exactly what you want to say
but you did take a much higher stakes
approach than one person in Artemis I
did and to be honest that was so I
wanted to be honest a lot of that was
pressure from the publisher interested
yeah there they wanted it to be higher
stakes and that that's a that's a
continual argument um there is just a
general understanding or belief that you
know the stakes have to be inordinately
high in science fiction and I disagree
with that I just I think that if there's
a character and you like that character
you care about that character and it's
rare to see science fiction where it's
just you know a small group of people
with their small group of problems and
it's very very important to them and by
extension you as the reader but it's not
that important to the universe at large
so how does that work when when your
publisher I mean like how much do you
have written because presumably if
you've written enough that it's clear
what the stakes are going to be and
maybe as you're saying in Artemis
initially the stakes were not as high as
they ended up being your publisher comes
to you and they say yeah Andy this is
this is cool but we need it to be higher
stakes so do look don't you have to
rewrite a significant portion of your
entire book at that point well I would
except for in this case the the basic
plot flow of Artemis I gave it to them
as an outline initially I said like
here's a sequence of events and so we
kind of made those macroscopic plot
adjustments right then rather than me
writing the whole book how or let me put
it a different way
does tensions develop when there might
be an element to the story that you
think is sort of a key element that the
publisher says this has to be changed
and how do you sort of navigate that
well my editor is a really easy guy to
work with his name is Julian Padilla at
Crown and the kind of the feel of things
is it's all suggestions it's not like
he's making demands it's not like he's
saying like oh you've got a you've got
to change those changes it's not like
he's coming at me like he's my boss but
he does he does tell me he's like here
here's why I don't think this works or
here's why I think this has a problem or
here's why this here's why that and
here's what I'd like and
so yeah sometimes there is some tension
and sometimes I get frustrated because
yeah especially you know certain things
that that that they want that I don't
feel are necessary but you're gonna find
out with every every author and his
editor everywhere like so we're speaking
with Andy weir he's the New York Times
bestselling author of the Martian and
Artemis will pause our conversation with
him there and pick it up tomorrow we're
continuing our conversation with Andy
weir he's the New York Times bestselling
author of the Martian and Artemis we've
been speaking about the books the
Martian and Artemis but let's talk a
little bit about the movie the Martian
I've talked to a lot of writers who have
had work turned into movies or
television programs every single one of
their stories is drastically different
about how
and sort of what the process was so like
where were you when you found out hey
there's going to be a movie or there's
interest in making a movie here well I
mean I was at home and I mean I received
an email Fox was interested in the film
option on on the Martian which yeah and
so I passed that along to my agent and
we went through that process of signing
the contract and all that but it was it
everybody told me at that point you know
don't get excited
Studios by film options all the time it
doesn't mean they're gonna make a movie
they're just securing the rights in case
they want to make a movie right it's a
nice it's a nice tidy little sum of
money small compared to what you're
making off of the publishing so don't
get excited
but hey enjoy it you know it's it's
money coming out of left field it's good
yeah I actually interviewed Richard
Morgan about ten years ago and at that
point somebody maybe Warner Brothers had
bought an option on altered carbon and
of course three days ago it finally
became a series on Netflix so that that
how long it can take yeah that that's
called development help but it's it's
it's fine it's like it's just like an
extra little supplemental bit of money
and and you you put yourself in the
mindset of like well they're not gonna
do anything with it
they've just you know they've they
they're gonna give me money every
eighteen months or so it's basically
like they rent the option film options
are just they they expire so they have
the rights for like twelve or eighteen
months or whatever and then beyond that
they they the rights devolve back to me
and I can go sell them again when they
buy the rights that means they activate
the big expensive part of the contract
and they generally don't do that unless
they are definitely going to make a
movie right because they don't want to
spend the extra money for no reason
and so likes well this I'm getting a
call I'm sorry about that apologize I
forgot it happens to the best yeah I
forgot forgot to airplane and load the
phone apologize airplane mode now but
yeah who is actually the editor I was
taught
about we're not going out live are we
we're not live how fortunate so
eventually when does it become more real
I guess is the question well what
happens is a bit by bit the project just
kind of crawls forward at first they're
like oh hey Drew Goddard is interested
in writing and directing oh that's cool
okay it's like okay Drew Goddard wrote a
screenplay or is writing a screenplay
and it's really good and and we're we've
we've shopping it around to two leads or
we send it to Fox and Fox said like well
this is a really good screenplay but it
can't it can't work unless you get a big
leading man because it's so much time
spent with him so you're gonna need to
you know find a big lead or we're not
interested so they start shopping it out
on these Hail Mary passes to the biggest
names in Hollywood and then Matt Damon
says like yeah I'll play that role and
then suddenly everything becomes a lot
more serious like it's like oh wow we've
got a real a real genuine legitimate
name attached to this now and then and
then drew ended up leaving the project
to go work on spider-man for Sony so
then we have all we needed a director
and then Ridley Scott said he'd direct
and once you got Ridley Scott and Matt
Damon on the project then the big names
start piling in and it just started
snowballing but at any point it was
always possible that the studio could
pull the plug
they could say like yeah this is really
impressive but it's also getting really
expensive and they were worried about it
because of course their company they
want to make money they their job isn't
to make awesome movies their job is to
make profitable movies and they're like
well this is getting up over a hundred
million dollars now I mean are we gonna
make that money back and so you never
really knew until the day they started
shooting and once they started shooting
that first scene then they were on the
hook to pay all their all the talent and
that means that the cheapest path is now
to make the movie and that that's when I
could really celebrate now is it true
that you did not visit the set which was
in Budapest because at the time you you
weren't flying as I understand it right
because of a fear of
yes I still have a fear of flying I just
am flying somewhat now and then but
Budapest is really far away and I didn't
want to go and they did they yeah they
did the the studio work in Budapest and
they did the on location stuff in Wadi
Rum which is a desert in Jordan and I
didn't go to any of that I just wasn't
willing to travel that far but I did get
to meet all the cool famous people you
know I went to the premiere I there were
a bunch of marketing events and and
publicity events where I ended up with
them with with the cast and stuff so I
got I got to be starstruck and stuff
without having to go to Budapest that's
super interesting to me because I mean
in in the writing of the Martian in the
story there are definitely very sort of
if not physically certainly
psychologically claustrophobic sort of
circumstances that you put the character
into which even as someone like me who
has no problem flying that unnerved me
to some degree was that in any way was
the the sort of writing of those scenes
in that way in any way related to your
real world fear of flying well my real
world fear of flying is actually just
one part of a general anxiety disorder
that I have so what I really don't like
is not having control over my
environment in my situation yeah like I
don't like fact that you know somebody
else is flying a plane and all this
technology that was checked up on by
engineers I don't know you know is my
life good really depends on it and that
stuff makes me nervous so it's a lack of
control I think is what I'm really
afraid of it's not literally like
misunderstanding airline safety and
thinking it's likely crash or something
like that oh no no I I know very well
that I'm far more likely to die in a car
crash on my way to the airport than I am
to die on the flight right but it's just
this irrational phobia by definition
phobias are irrational and I just I
don't like that lack of control and and
so it informs my writing very
tangentially like
it's basically like Watney was in a
situation where he's um it how do I put
it he's in a lot of trouble but he's
never not in control you know he's he's
always had he always has the ability to
at least attempt to survive right
I remember that I you'll have to correct
me but I don't know if it was the Oscars
or some other prizes where'd the Martian
was in the Comedy category is that right
yeah that was the golden globes golden
um what was that that's Lauren B is odd
I mean I don't know what your reaction I
I and in thinking about it and I'll let
you kind of give your side of it since
you wrote it after all the way the
dialogue both internal and and actual
dialogue of the book were written
there's elements certainly of comedy but
it's it seemed weird to me to call it a
comedy so this was in 2016 right or the
73rd Golden Globes it was a it was
celebrating 2015 so yeah the the other
comedies were joy and the big short and
spy and trainwreck now spy and
trainwreck are both proper comedies yeah
right
those are both actual comedies joy was
was Jennifer Lawrence as the inventor
who invented that type of mop and she
you remember this movie yeah that's not
a comedy and the the big short about the
about people who made a bunch of money
off of the mortgage collapse also not a
comedy right yes so so this is this is a
common issue in the Golden Globes they
basically they want to give away they
want to give away more more more things
they want to give away more Awards so
that they can have more famous people up
on stage I think I'm not sure what's the
most difficult part of the entire movie
process is that seeing things
transformed from how you wrote them into
a screenplay that might not necessarily
reflect that is it something like you
write this thing and it gets turned into
a
and then it's nominated as a comedy
which it's not like what what element
was the most difficult for you you know
no part of it was difficult for me I
know it sounds weird but it's like yeah
the the the whole project had a charmed
existence like everything went right
every actor was Vale I mean there were a
few hiccups here and there but like for
the most part everything went right the
