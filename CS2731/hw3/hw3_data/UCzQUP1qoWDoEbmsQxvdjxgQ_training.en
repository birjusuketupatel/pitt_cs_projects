so why aren't there flying cars you just
jumping right in you don't say hi
you don't say how's the wife already
how's the wife
how's your book it's been on The Times
bestseller list for how many weeks oh
that the astrophysics for people in a
hurry that's been on the on the New York
Times bestseller was for 67 weeks that's
pretty intense
it's great that's that's a lot for any
book much less for a science book and so
that tells me while all these Trump
books are wafting in and out this is Bob
being like a court like a cork on the
ocean waves as the book of the moment
that either praises Trump or criticized
or it criticizes them come in and off of
that list so this tells me that there is
this unserved hunger that people have
there's a curiosity that this is serving
and it's - astrophysics for people in a
hurry that's kind of a that's very
purposefully juxtaposed it's like
neurosurgery in four easy steps you know
if you saw a book with that title you
have to pick up under what's going on
well not to kiss your ass again but I
always say this about you and I think
it's important you make learning stuff
about astrophysics fun and that's what's
missing you know it's not that people
don't like to be educated that they
don't like to learn they just don't want
to be bored
that's a perceptive point because you
know think of the image we have of let's
say you're in a school where most people
don't go to college if you're in high
school and then last day of school comes
what do people do they toss their papers
in the air as they run down the steps
school's out no but what's the rock song
[Music]
forever right so that attitude must mean
the school didn't train you to embrace
curiosity right that learning was a
chore and now the chores are over yeah
so I think the educational system needs
an adjustment forget whether or not you
go to college because you're going to
spend
years not in school than in school even
if you do go to college what you want I
think are lifelong learners lifelong
curiosity yes where once you are trained
and and and and and your curiosity is
stimulated the curiosity we've all had
as children your children don't need to
be taught to be curious they are curious
to the point of destruction of whatever
it is they touch oh what is this egg on
the counter
what is this glass what is this plate
what's under a rock what happens when I
pull a leg off a daddy long you know
they are experimenting with the world we
don't think of it that way but that's
what it is they're all born scientists
and I say this often you spend the first
years of a child's life teaching it to
walk and talk then you spend the rest of
its life telling it to shut up and sit
it's this this is the wrong combination
so speaking as an educator I think a
missing component of school is is that
the teachers is that the curriculum I
don't know but when you get out of
school you should say to yourself damn I
want to learn more it's almost
universally accepted to that that's when
you're learning ends when you get out of
college it's over you say you're done
and if it doesn't you're ossified in
line and that's how when the job market
shifts you're not ready for it because
you don't know how to think you don't
know how to learn right no and it's the
difference in the in the workplace
between the person who gets an
assignment I Joey
Janet I need you to do this that's not
in my job description I'm not trained
for this that's one kind of person in a
workplace another kind of person is but
here's a new task I need you to do wow
I've never seen that before
great let me figure it out right he's a
two completely different species of
human being and what the world needs
more of is like the the second case
where you take a new task and you say
wow I get to learn I'm gonna learn on my
own I'll ask people who know more you
just you just embrace the act of
learning to satisfy your curiosity and I
think this book is capturing that in the
public I must be doing something yeah
yeah 60 how many weeks 67 weeks yeah
yeah that's a lot of weeks yeah every
morning I wake up I'm I'm calm but I'm
really not calm I'm saying holy [ __ ]
sorry you're alive I can't can I say you
can say [ __ ] I could say it Isis we're
human people think you're a robot now
they know this is it's a great sign I
think and I think your podcast is a
great sign as well the success of your
podcast and the success of a lot of
science podcasts that's an excellent you
notice that there's a rise of science
curious podcast out there stuff to blow
your mind is one that I really enjoy
right I really love radio lab they've
always got elaborate interesting science
the annual perennial favorite that so
many people probably the best right yeah
and and yours as well and I love Chuck
nice shout-out to Chuck nice Oh Chuck we
love Chuck he's great but what you're
doing is you're making learning
interesting and that's why it's so fun
it's it's it's it's there's excitement
to it he bring a comedian like Chuck on
with you things get silly but they're
also curious and you're getting these
experts and everyone's talking about
these various subjects and and as you
know not only yourself as an exemplar of
this stand-up comedians are some of the
smartest people in the world they have
it that they have that far so stand-up
comedians are perceptive people yes and
for sure and they're aware and they
notice things that you don't notice they
see the same things you do and get to
shape it in a way you never thought
possible and then you end up laughing at
other things at yourself was it your
idea to do your show with stand-ups so
so what we have there there there was
several of us who have created this
concept and we there's Helen matzos is
one of the partners and there's another
one who's now left but I get his name in
a minute but there were three of us who
David gamble was his name the three of
us got together and applied for a
National Science Foundation grant what
we said was there are programs out there
that serve people who already know they
like science but who serves the people
who don't know they like science or
better yet the people who know they
don't like science
there's nothing for them because they've
already rejected it
they're not gonna tune in to science
Friday because they don't like science
right on NPR right so what we thought
was suppose we bring in a celebrity
we've all that the pop culture draw this
is the pop culture scaffold we bring in
this scaffold and glad the scaffold with
science because whatever the celebrity
does it doesn't matter there's gonna be
science in that person's life
we had the guy who portrayed Gollum in
Lord of the Rings a lot of getting that
suit that he underwear exactly so what
we did was we so we interview him and we
talked about the technology necessary to
portray go him as a lot he portrayed
that live that was not some later
animation he is live and he's got his
whole body wired up for this and he is
that voice and he is portraying it so so
whatever it is that you have done that
you do there is such because it's
evidence that science is everywhere
you're not gonna you can't say I'm done
with science let me sell my textbook and
move on to other things because
practically anything else you do has
been touched by science and so star talk
is a celebration of that and then a jump
species and so now we're on TV now
alright this is a TV show on National
Geographic Channel star talk
and since you started this by the way I
didn't come here to talk about you you
started this where's our fourth year in
a row we're nominated for an Emmy for
Outstanding informational programming
are you gonna keep doing cosmos too
though cuz Oh cosmos so so so I have one
week remaining out of like seven D shoot
days to finish shooting cosmos possible
worlds premiering spring 2019 there's
the third installment of cosmos if you
trace the first one to Carl Sagan back
in 1980 okay you are I used your segment
on wolves on how wolves became dogs Oh
showed it to my kids and that's right
see the little wheel spinning like whoa
yeah that's how dog became a dog that
what you didn't see is I'm sitting at
the campfire
and this in the snowy environment and
they got wolves walking around me there
on these fishing wires because they they
are not dogs right okay they they debate
over the [ __ ] they want
what correct and when they looking at
you it's it's like should I rip his neck
out now or later when I'm more hungry
right they're not there's no eye contact
with them because they you don't that
they don't see you as anything other
than something that could possibly eat
and so you can interact with them the
way you would with ordinary dogs so
they're on these fishing you know high
tension fishing wire that you can't see
against the snow and they're like
hooting and hollering around me as I
described and the name of that show is
and the wolf shall become the shepherd
yeah my friend did a commercial with the
wolf and there's this commercial where
he's running up this mountain and the
wolf is there and at the end of the
commercial they had to get the wolf to
snarl so what the trainer does is he
shows the wolf some meat and then he
pulls the meat away from the wolf and
the wolf snarls and they're like and
then the commercials over he's like no
no there's no working after that like
there's no Yukie not gonna be near the
wolf right like that switch is turned on
done yeah and it's it's crazy like once
that thing snarled everybody just backed
off and the trainer let everybody know
like once I get to this point we're done
like there's no more everybody can [ __ ]
out of here all three of these cosmoses
the original one with Carl Sagan the one
that the privilege of hosting in 2014
and 2019 are co-written by andrian and
she's the the widow of Carl Sagan oh my
and but she it kind of in his shadow
back then but she's hugely creative and
highly enlightened and so most of the
sort of the the the soul energy if you
will the that what makes cosmos distinct
from other from other documentaries
where you're sort of sitting there
learning you put your thinking cap on
your learning cap on in cosmos it's your
feelin cap you're not only learning
you're also feeling the science and its
relationship to you to civilization
to the world to the universe and her
infusion of this she's a highly
scientifically literate writer producer
and so I just give a shout out to her
just working with her as minute delight
his cosmos on Apple TV or so cosmos was
after at first after it premiered on Fox
and then went internationally on Nat Geo
it then went to Netflix so but I think
this run of Netflix is gonna drop until
the next one comes in I think they want
to clear the clear the landing zone for
the next cosmos but it went to Netflix
but is it available for anyone to get
right now oh right now it should be I
haven't checked that's a great question
I have it all on my DVR and I'm scared
to delete it oh I have like 6% left
space but everyone's DVR looks like I
got your cosmos is in there yeah so
thanks thanks for having having them all
in there who's that Morgan Freeman show
but through the through the wormhole
yeah yeah that's that's that's a Joe
Rogan thing yeah you didn't have that
I'd be disappointed huh I say you're an
imposter you're a fake it's it's an
opportunity to be entertained and
learned which i think is what everybody
misses and I think that's that's what's
missing in most public education it's
people are bored and you take these kids
with so much energy and then you make
them sit still and watch something
that's not even remotely stimulating by
a person who doesn't really care to be
there right right and they know they
know this they know this intuitively if
not explicitly that the enthusiasm is
absent yeah they could feel it yeah and
just it's the worst way to learn it's
the the worst way and it's so hard to
skate once you get out of that system it
takes forever for a lot of these people
to just get their excitement about
education back you know what I say when
I address teachers we all by the way
I'll do this right now in this room that
we have this only three of us but let's
let's take a show of hands in your life
with all the teachers you've ever had in
every class you've ever taken how many
had like a singular influence on who and
what you became
give me a number it's gonna be I'm
betting it's five or fewer probably more
like three yeah for teachers what's your
number
well theirs was the one that I talked
about in your show the last time I saw
you thanks for coming on to start my
pleasure it was a science teacher that I
had when I believe I was in seventh
grade
told me that if you really want to hurt
your brain look up and recognize the
fact that that goes on forever that this
is infinite and then just think about
what that means infinite that there
really is no end to it so but how many
teachers such as that we're so
influential on you that one guy saying
that one so he was not one class one he
might be the one and what do you got for
me it's like two and a half and I've had
scores of teachers yeah okay a hundred
teachers at least so what I tell
teachers is be that teacher to your
students we've all had those teachers be
that teacher and in every case it wasn't
because the topic was something you knew
in advance you would like it's because
their energy for sharing their passion
and love for the subject was palpable
yeah and it just spilled out of him and
went into the course through your veins
and your arteries and you walk out of
there thinking wow that was the most
interesting thing I've ever done in my
life you don't even care what you get on
a test after that because you got
touched and you became an enlightened
participant in that exercise in that
exploration yeah it's just so hard for
them to even get kids attentions though
yes unfortunately hatches going on
unfortunate that could be in some places
half the energy of the teachers is
maintaining order I think the success of
your book the success of your show your
podcast and many of these other really
intelligent podcasts are showing though
there's an appetite for this stuff out
there yeah and I'm delighted to be a
servant of that curiosity and this I
brought this just because it's not even
out yet this the you're airing like now
live this is it you're alive you are
okay so this is like a five-second delay
what is this accessory to war oh this
this is like another book I just this is
coming out in three weeks
is this about space war accessory to war
the unspoken alliance between
astrophysics and the military ah yeah so
so this other book was astrophysics for
people in a hurry if you're in a hurry
do not buy people in a hurry this is not
this is not what this is not an impulse
item at the checkout line this is you
got this is this is all about by the way
we know what role the physicist plays in
war the physicist makes the bomb invents
the bomb the chemist perfects napalm the
biologists weaponize --is anthrax and
the astrophysicist
well we sit at the end of a telescope
and wait for photons to cross the
universe and enter our detector and we
go into conferences and argue about them
so there is no obvious connection
between what we do and military strength
hegemony dominance empire building it's
just not obvious that's why this
subtitle is the unspoken Alliance it's
not a secret it's just it's not there
it's there but it's not nobody's talking
about it do you realize I'll just give
an example okay if you needed more
reasons to think that Columbus was a
dick okay let me add one to it when we
were kids on today yeah I know I know
but actually I do have something smiled
Lee redeeming to offer about Columbus if
you have the time I just wanted okay
okay
start off with that you want me start
out with that well how you want to do it
I'll do the dick part okay so on his
third voyage he's in by the time as of
his third voyage he had already planted
enough Spanish flags that Spain had
already begun to set up governments and
infrastructures in these places
he had found ya basically conquered and
so so in one of the places I'd was it's
in the book accurately but they think
it's Hispaniola one of the island today
he has to get back as his third voice
1503 or 1504 he's got to get back to
Spain he doesn't have enough resources
not enough food for his crew so he asked
the natives would you please give us
some of your stock that you have
collected from your farming now this
particular group of natives only makes
exactly the amount of food they need to
tie to the next crop
they don't have surplus so they said no
we don't have surplus sorry Columbus
knew that one week hence coincidentally
there was going to be a total lunar
eclipse with a moon in its orbit around
Earth enters Earth's shadow the full
moon enters Earth's shadow and
disappears and that the geometry of that
event it's just a simple lunar eclipse
but the geometry says that sunlight
passes around Earth through Earth's
atmosphere and takes on sunset colors
that leech into Earth's shadow giving
the moon if you can see it at all a deep
red amber hue almost the color of blood
Columbus set and he knew about this
because he had read the tables the
Eclipse tables all right we'd known
enough about the solar system at the
time too we got that okay actually back
then it was just the known world with
earth in the middle of the known
universe that didn't matter the rhythms
of the universe were known he says to
the natives if you do not give us food
my god which is more powerful than your
God will make the moon disappear and it
will turn blood red that will happen in
one week you have one week to comply
some of them were skeptical what you
can't what others said [ __ ] we got it to
what this guy says look at the ships
they came in their guns their power
their their culture look what they've
got sure enough right on cue
the moon begins to disappear according
to that that is a famous woodcut that
you know you got this Oh some those
viewing the video of this yeah there's a
famous woodcut and notice the natives
bowing to him and he stands proudly cuz
he knows the science he knows the
astronomy he knew this and so he invokes
this to dominate people who are not yet
scientifically literate and within
seconds of this beginning they bring him
all the resources he wants and he gets
and I we don't know what happened you
know back at the island whether the
people survived the winter but he got
back to the island that is one microcosm
of a set of ways that the universe has
been invoked in this I'll give you
another example los alamos one of the
National Labs they today as basically
since their inception are charged with
tracking the nuclear arsenal of the
United States our nuclear power the
nukes that would go into nuclear weapons
poom and we're live and well I yeah a
little closer a little closer all right
don't worry fellow okay how you doing
very nice to meet you nice to meet you
too
you're remarkably normal oh thanks I
know people are we struck at how normal
I am am i it's like wow really I think
my roommate a shoe the maze I guess
seeing a famous child and yeah yeah
that's a very unusual maze yeah my life
is unique to me that's what I like to
say you know yeah and I'm almost like a
peerless person like to a certain extent
there's not too many people I can look
left and right and we you know I I'm
like we have similar experiences yes
there anybody that you ever contacted
like Jodie Foster or someone who's made
it through and seems pretty put together
not really no not really I mean it's
kind of a weird cold call you know hey
Jodie Foster such a small clan of people
like if a comic called me that I knew
you know who wanted to talk to me I
would talk to them because it's such a
small people I mean we do have our
weekly therapy sessions yeah
Jodie Foster you know yeah like we all
get together and yeah we we weep you
know actually we do primal screaming
that's what we do I was describing when
it was like I have a friend who Ricky
Schroder who is you know obviously he
was very famous for news young as well
and one of my favorite theme songs TV
theme songs and I was saying like the
way you developed is not like the way
the recipe calls mmm-hmm like the recipe
calls for you to have a childhood and
try to figure out life and then become a
man and try to find yourself and then
try to find your path and by the time
you became a man he was already famous
and the same thing with you you were
already famous as you were developing
and learning yeah you know yeah III
don't know exactly how to like kind of
even describe it because it's always the
way my life has been kind of thing
getting the same way that like a lot of
kids like you know they go out
and they you know catch bugs and play
saying lot baseball or whatever like
yeah just like yeah like that's the way
it is like you don't really realize how
unique the whole situation is until you
have perspective because you have
nothing to compare it to really other
than I guess TV shows and movies things
like that so I knew that my upbringing
was unique you know I knew it was
different but at the same time it kind
of just it's not until you get some
perspective some life experience but
until you really realize that oh wait
this was this was particularly weird you
know I think one of the aspects is
particularly worried about it is a lot
of kids that grow up famous they grow up
on the set yeah and they grow up
constantly around people who treat them
very differently than everyone else it's
not just that you're famous is that
you're famous and you're also the
complete center of attention mm-hmm like
you're the reason why we're here we're
here to do this television show we're
here to do this movie we're here to do
this thing you're the star mm-hmm and
that I think for a kid that's a very
strange place to be yeah and especially
like I mean I like when I was a kid like
me even before I started working I
always liked being like the center of
attention kind of thing I was too you
know I was just I was very boisterous
you know but uh but in general like I
never really liked being fussed over
when I didn't like you know like at the
hair makeup costume people like poking
at you all the time and things like they
actually wasn't a huge fan after a while
of kind of like being that at center of
attention you know it it does become a
job after a while yeah yeah like early
on you kind of just do what you do like
that's like I was good at it and boom
liked it in the same way like that you
do look anything that you're like you
like it's where the child labor laws
don't apply to actor you do do that
yeah I'm pretty well-versed in child
labor laws well how's that work then it
goes from state to state they can work
you like let's say like in New York they
can work you ten hours yeah but it
stopped right there they can work you
well if you can't get a job if they're
eight that's what you're that's what
you're kind of like that's what their
limit is at the same time you have to
get three hours of schooling in plus an
hour of lunch so really you're only
you're available window is only six
hours or something like that
all right day and then like that also in
like in that six hours they're always
like setting up the lights for the next
shot and you know the hurry-up-and-wait
kind of part of you know
things that's why I like the second home
alone it took like nearly five months to
film because they can only mean
virtually every scene and they can only
use me X amount of hours a day kind of
thing but that isn't that the only job
that you can work when you're eight
years old I don't know why you can't be
a carpenter I mean I guess you can do
modeling you know I mean but like some
kind of performing arts kind of thing
like there are dancers and so forth
mm-hmm
because I would say I was a ballet
dancer before I was an actor really yeah
I did ballet for a number of years I'm a
classically trained ballerina right here
ballerina if you're a man I call it I
say I'm a ballet dancer hmm
but there is a weird ballarino like that
some of the Meuse and I'm like I'm not I
don't think I can call myself a
ballerina look I just can't it's two
bros so I did that for a number of years
and there's a bunch of kids like any
that do that and you get paid and you do
the work Wow
so you know there are other I guess
trades yeah it seems like it's no
business though yeah yeah that's what I
mean I think it's more in the performing
arts kind of thing like you know you
don't see a lot of kids working the coal
mines anymore like that kind of thing
yeah for good reason alright but some
people think that my six-year-old dyeing
a black lung you know there's some
horrible pictures from like the early
1900s of people actually working in the
coal mines when they're little tiny kids
yep yep yeah I mean there are no Newsies
anymore you know look yeah did you have
any say in whether or not you worked
when you were young not really no yeah
look it was after a while it became like
I said a job and it was I like I never
chose the projects they were like my
parents can you essentially like chose
them for me so you'll news McCallie yeah
exactly yeah yeah they called you in a
class and like I never read any two
scripts look I would I would just read
like the lines for like the next day or
whatever like I would like get the gist
of what the movie was about but then I
just kind of show up and
hit my marks find my light you know you
know and recite my lines so real it's
kind of just like again it's what you do
right like it's like in the same way
that like like kids go to like school or
something like that like you know you
you you follow to a routine to a certain
extent yeah well that's the thing about
the human mind right so flexible mhm you
could adopt any sort of weird scenario
especially when you're a kid I mean okay
you just bounce look all the time it's
adapt so easy
exactly exactly and I always had like a
good memory and things like that like
you know I liked you know I was I was
big and charismatic and I like had a
good memory like so I could remember my
lines like that's pretty much what like
if you you know like not gonna give any
advice to any people about like yeah you
should put your kid into this line of
work but at the same time like what
producers really care about is whether
or not you remember your lines but they
like people you know never work with
kids or animals kind of thing yeah it's
like yeah and they want they they really
all they really care about is you
remember your lines really like because
apparently that's a problem like for me
it never was look if I ever lost my
place I would just see the script in my
head and just read it look I think I
kind of had a photographic memory back
then
oh it's faded now I'm 37 I'm about to be
38 in like two weeks
feels weird doesn't it yeah you know
yeah look uh my my bowels are different
what's different about your bow oh yeah
I know just like I like I just got a uh
doing some like random checkup kind of
thing and they're like oh we should
scope you you know so they also you know
they I did the scoping like you know in
my stomach kind of thing but they also
you know I got a colonoscopy so I was
actually hoping like usually were put me
under so I was like it didn't really
matter to me but I was gonna put you
under for a colonoscopy yeah yeah you
know at least I had that anus coping so
I think I don't know again it's down the
throat I was hoping I was actually
hoping they were going to use the but
one first and then put it in my mouth
just ass to mouth boom look at me up but
no no they apparently they use different
cameras
yeah the probably designed different
yeah all goes deep right but uh because
they were like all worried I might have
an ulcer oh into the veins or something
yeah again kind of it's been a little
iffy and so the good news is I didn't
have an ulcer bad news is I have two
ulcers yeah so I'm dealing with that
I've had to like curtail my lifestyle in
general like I'm eating less red meat
you know less carbonated beverages like
ibuprofen no more ibuprofen like there's
no fans terrible for you good yeah
exactly so look I've had to like you
know I used to like eat like burgers
every single day and now it's like I can
have two servings of red meat a week
kind of thing and what it wasn't too
hard for me to curtail my lifestyle like
as smoking less trying to drink less
like things like that what's the logic
behind red meat less I think I I'm not
the doctor yeah it's like if you read
the list of like yeah things that are
good or bad for your alter some things
that aggravate it yeah exactly so red
meat like falls into that category like
it was a funny microwave but chicken
doesn't fish doesn't apparently not or
at least you know less so weird and yeah
might because my special lady friend she
was like you know worried about me and
stuff so she was reading up on like you
know ulcers and things like that and it
was like the first like it was like
seven things that like that flared up
and all of them were like checkmarks
really exactly what I was doing in my
life kind of thing like you know I had
like I said red meats smoking drinking
like I had just had like a neck issue so
I was taking a lot of ibuprofen like you
know and it was just like every single
checkmark you know so yeah I've read
something about ibuprofen doing it
because ibuprofen disrupts gut bacteria
and they believe that gut bacteria but
was there was something really recent
about that a real recent study they
think that they found a new cause for
ulcers like they've changed what they
think these two thing was caused by
stress which can do it like also look I
just again I have also had like I've
just started a new company and things
like that so like I have that kind of
stress like kind of thing like you know
like look I said I hit a lot of the
checkmarks looking when you say can do
it I think what they were saying was
they used to think it can do it but now
they think it's all a matter of bacteria
in your stomach yeah I mean I think
that's a big part of
also if you like cuz I did a movie in
Thailand like last year and came back
you know came back with a worm so you
know what are those like single-cell
kind of like you know when I was getting
the medication for it I was like so what
do i what should I expect from this he's
like what do you expect you to get
better
I go yeah but like you know what's like
sit am I gonna [ __ ] a worm am I gonna
[ __ ] out and they're like no no no one
of those single-cell ones but it made me
more susceptible to like getting ulcers
you know so is this because the
antibiotics that you had to take for the
worm or I mean I think it just it messes
with your stomach chemistry kind of
thing so after that is when you got the
old yeah exactly exactly so you know
dealing with it like it's actually it's
actually not so bad
look you know like so how's it do do how
does it what does it alter do you know
sometimes you kind of get a little pain
things like then um yeah like I mean at
one point I was like [ __ ] like 10
times a day kind of thing you know what
I mean like it was kind of just like
kind of loosened your stool a little bit
yeah yeah couldn't get some mucus II
like I mean I can go in go into it
that's what I mean you're asking me yeah
I find this stuff fascinating
like what just came out of me right when
you can't see what's going on it's like
behind a door yeah that's happening to
it yeah I was like what was that was
that chicken I don't know like which
meal was that one like you know a guy
I'm experimenting with my stomach seeing
what it comes out the other end kind of
thinking again
did you experiment at all with
probiotics did you do anything to try to
yeah this is a fairly recent thing this
has only been like the last like not
even two months looking last like him
yeah like eight weeks or so so like I am
just kind of easing into this thing I
have a list I made a little list or like
things that are good for me looking or
like to eat it things like that like you
know make sure I get some yogurt like
lots of leafy greens you know ribbon on
you jacket you have pinned to the safety
pin it's a participation badge
participate in life look at me yeah I
mean I I mean I went to a UH it was a
camp like a summer camp themed wedding
back in like almost a year ago some like
that and so like they were giving out
participation badges like kind of thing
because if you participated in things
but ya know everyone always asked me
about
the ribbon like yeah I kind of just a
safety pin yeah yeah kind of just you
know I mean I wear like all kinds of
things but for some reason everyone's
like what is that what's that look no
I'm participating in life here I am
aren't I
look here I'm on your podcast you are
participating I am participating you
seem really healthy like you seem like a
like a together person oh yeah I know
that it's really stuck in a shocker for
people I guess so look you know I'm
actually usually for the most part I'm
pretty put together look at yeah look I
I got a good life now I got have a
special lady friend we have a dog and a
cat
oh yeah yeah it's for a family yeah
exactly like there's one thing to like
exchange keys it's another to get a cat
you know so we we had as you can get a
cat together cuz cat can kind of go
anywhere

almost like I feel entitled to make like
Asian jokes because I have an Asian
girlfriend kind of thing okay you're
loud I don't think I'm well I do it with
her like all the time but like I don't
do anybody know yeah
it's like it's like oh it's like a baby
you're my Yoko like you know just like
you know like it's like you you're gonna
be my downfall you're the most hated
person in all of music yeah exactly
exactly used to be able to if you were
married to an Asian woman 10-15 years
ago I think if I I think if I have Asian
babies I'd be allowed to think so man I
don't even think so because you know I
I'd had to deal with it every kind of
like day kind of thing it's like oh well
like I can you know I understand the
struggle kind of things you know I'm
trying to shield my kids
white male wealthy white male who's
famous you don't have a chance I guess I
know right privileged blond-haired Aryan
male who grew up famous yeah exactly
they're just warming their fingers up
right there probably write a blog about
you thinking that you can make Asian
trip I know I know I know well that was
one of the things that like you know one
of the things I really loved about her
like was I remember when I made my first
like Asian crack look and I just wanted
this and she could have like stopped and
then she was like laughs she was like I
can't believe you said that
like what was it I said I said you know
how I know you're Asian she goes why I
said this is shape your eyes it's dead
giveaway she could stop that's funny
you're allowed to say that yeah I can't
say because the way you drive [ __ ] yeah
I know exactly yeah you have to have a
really like good sense of humor to
accept that yeah exactly yeah but you
know have a special relationship where
you guys talk to each other it's like
baby you are such a good driver like
just you know like just like you know
she's like shut up would you stop with
the Asian stuff like oh yeah cuz you
actually eat she is an excellent driver
so well you could tell her you're a
really good driver for you know
no why that's weird forget I even
brought it up I'm like so not racist I
don't even understand what exactly like
believe me I'm pretty relentless but her
family like they also like their they're
down with like yeah it's it's I wouldn't
even call it a teasing it's just like
you're just telling jokes kind of thing
looking yeah because I'm the only time
cuz I'm the only white boy like you know
whenever we visit the family I got yeah
it's the foot brand evasion its Ty Lee
Ocean oh wow yeah yeah I know I know the
ocean yeah yeah I just got back from
Thailand oh yeah yeah first time ever
that's where I caught my worm yeah yeah
so what is this worm like did you fight
it was it under your skin was I didn't
that's what a professional does
professional turns that [ __ ] down on
down huh a non-professional or someone
who's half-assing it they keep that
phone up really yeah have you seen that
yeah some people keep that phone up
checked that phone on time they'll check
in the middle podcast Russell Peter
can't leave his phone alone really try
getting through a [ __ ] whole podcast
with Russell Peters without I'm checking
his tweets what's impossible impossible
he's checking things sometimes you read
off tweets and say oh people Oh Doug
Benson used to do that that's why I read
off the tweets I'm trying to get away
from it if I can I'll find times if I'm
gonna go eat now I'll even leave it at
my phone in the car yes Power Move and I
hadn't done that before I just started
and it's not even a natural choice I'm
making almost it's like something I need
to do yeah it's a [ __ ] move all
right you're scared scared to leave it
in there
yeah scared scared to leave that phone
would have something important I guess I
needed to know but there isn't there is
a thing like what if something important
happens yeah but what is you think like
when does that happen
super rare but if it did happen why your
phone was in the car and somebody needed
you you'd feel terrible right but you
gotta just what is the what's the
balance it's like it's so slippery we
didn't have any way to get in touch with
back in the day you had to yell for help
number that yeah you can't yell huh yeah
not in Los Angeles there's too many
people you yell for help nobody's in
some languages helped me in something
else I think it's you know something not
good or something Arabic or something
people will [ __ ] you up just make that
up I'm not sure honestly I think I might
have heard that because I live in
Westwood and we have it's very diverse
over there's a lot of people sometimes
yell and stuff in the street do you
think for real do you think help mean
something bad in other languages is that
real
somebody told me hello means go to hell
in like Greek or Latin like um like
politics means like political like up
like um something like not good like
something tick like a tick like
blood-sucking oh really
government or something like that let's
start
with one let's start with should we do
with hello first yeah I think cuz and I
just say things and I don't even know
sometimes think if somebody just told me
to say hello when I was young and I've
been saying in my whole life but what
does help mean is help mean anything in
another language is help a bad word in
other languages okay I'm looking up if
the word help means something in another
language not right there word help you
got if the word help mean something in
another language that I think you mean
you're gonna have to rewarded it you're
gonna have to word it uniquely I think
cuz it's a that's a hard one that's a
that's a that's yeah I don't even know
anymore now be its translation that
might may be an Arabic or something like
that have any sort of alternate meanings
and other languages
yeah I'm not accusing anybody the Arab
nations or whatever Asians or whatever
you know Arabic and Hebrew like those
old old languages have the coolest
letters yeah way they write things like
you look at some old Hindu script or
something like that why is that looks so
cool it seemed like a mystery yeah man
anytime like even Russian when you see
Russian written out you're like whoa
look at the crazy little letters they
have like look at that like this is like
some alien writing yeah I'd be furious
I'm Dalek I couldn't I couldn't imagine
having to learn some of the other
languages you know like I'm going to
China next week when we want to Shanghai
and I'm like it's basically just me
looking around at different drawings you
know like as far as even though words go
it's gonna be I think they have a lot of
stuff in English there oh yeah yeah are
there a lot of a lot of countries where
there's a lot of tourism they just put
stuff in English English seems to be a
language that most European countries
like most people know you could you can
kind of get by in Italy you can kind of
get by in Germany they just speak
English it's uh it's it's real
interesting man because it's because I
guess there's so much tourism and I
guess what everyone's worried about us
because we have the nuclear bombs
everybody learned English and we
traveled a lot because we have more
money here probably so we have the
ability to go places maybe hmm
do you like English that's the only
language I know yeah yeah I like it
but it's just weird how much cooler
other languages look when they're
written out I guess it's just because
what we're accustomed to like Thai you
look at Thai writing or like yeah I was
sweating I tried to read some one time
and Thai I was sweating by the end of it
how crazy is that
that's crazy food yeah like it's just
like it took me out of my element man
there's a couple of uh a couple of words
off I you know I almost needed help
Asian characters look like if you had a
movie like a science fiction movie and
in the movie they found a crashed UFO
and I had some writing on the i-beams or
something like that hmm
would look like a lot of Asian writing
right it would look like something
something crazy from Asia that like you
like what am I looking at right like a
lease you saying it might as well be
alien writing if you don't know it yeah
if there were alien writing you think
it's gonna look more like something from
Asian writing than it is from American
writing well be weird if it was like
comic book font yeah like that or
whatever it's like wait a minute
aliens speak English yeah bro everybody
does what if aliens were like a Boeing
Shuttle man that's the biggest mind [ __ ]
that I ever heard was that because the
size of infinity mm-hmm not only is
there another Theo von out there in the
world but there because infinity is so
big I'm gonna butcher this for sure yeah
we talked about this a little bit last
one was in I did we the only thing
you've ever done
someone has done the exact same things
in the exact same order down to the last
millisecond do you believe do you okay
so that's something that you'd think or
that's something you think that could be
really true I think it could be really
true but honestly my brain is not really
strong enough to compute that so I would
have to take many many many hours really
thinking about what that means because
right now when I'm saying even when I'm
saying them I it's one of those whoa
dude things like I'm saying it but I'm
not really thinking it through yeah like
how much how how much you really
thinking through yeah just a couple
steps you don't really think
okay that there's a so then that means
for you there's another there's another
man out there who did comedy at last
hand at the Comedy Store who wore did
the exact same set tripped over the
exact same words spilt his water the
same way every it's supposed to be
everything and not not only that because
infinity so big they're supposed to be
an infinite number of those people out
there yeah I don't want that I don't man
cuz that would hurt my feelings honestly
it would make me feel I think it wakes
heads I think it makes sense I think the
universe is so big right I mean
everything's so big just what we know
about our solar system so big it's so
big that alone is crazy the idea that
there's no end of the crazy we're like
no no it's got to be an end no no no no
but no no that's too crazy yeah like
what's too crazy when it comes to the
universe the universe is crazy there's
nothing about it that makes any [ __ ]
sense
I mean it's so crazy that we don't like
to think about it last night I was
watching the fireworks and the fireworks
were going off and I was thinking yeah
this is kind of cool you know what's
cooler the [ __ ] billions of flying
explosions that are above our heads yeah
the free fireworks that are constantly
in the sky it's like we just will get
together for like some something made in
Honduras each other but the fact that
they're like shooting stars every night
yeah and we like because of street
lights we don't see the craziest light
show ever which is the Milky Way yeah
you know when you drive make that drive
like out to Vegas or you know into you
drive it through Montana at night or
something like that you pull over mm-hmm
what is that is that fireworks from last
night Wow that's last night is from the
NBC for helicopter that's crazy
Pasadena to downtown that's awesome
those are illegal
at least half of them are illegal right
I would say most of them are illegal it
looks like a lot of like kind of Civil
War artwork it's also sped up dude for a
firefighter that has got to be a crazy
time but some of them get off I think on
fires like some of my think they want a
little bit of fire you don't think yes
well it's been proven that some people
that are mentally ill that become
firemen
we start fires something you know it's
not it's not 99.999% of them or one of
the numbers but occasionally in every
line of work you get someone who's crazy
yeah and I could see that dude you want
something going and you don't have a lot
of money or anything like that it's also
just that one of their crazy yeah you
know they're just some people there's
something wrong right there's there's
connections that aren't being made in
there and they're not they they're
capable of doing things just to deceive
people rip people off or they're capable
of doing things for their own personal
gain like lighting a building on fire
just so they could put it out right
there's some people that are just broken
like there's something about them that's
just not connected right yeah we should
shut them down man I think I think in
the future we have to have some better
programs to find out who's just not even
care about people yeah yeah there's
people that yeah that's a really good
pair about people who doesn't care about
people because if you don't care about
people then it's just not then you
shouldn't be here you should be
somewhere else you should be in a place
where they don't have any people you
know yeah it's just a dangerous thing to
have around for the most part it's fine
right because life is fairly easy in
civilized times right most of stuff is
fine most of this stuff yeah without you
know the caveat for the occasional chaos
but it's just [ __ ] it's hard to tell
how crazy people are until something
really happens and I mean you really
need to count on them and when they you
know and you're pinned underneath a
dresser and they look at you and they
just run out of the room and just take
off and like you're not even gonna help
me there's people like that do you think
some of those people didn't even know
there that they would do that until the
situation arises then that sometimes
well I would love to have some and I
know this sounds a little dark but like
to have some serious stressors in our
world to find out even who I really am
you know like to see who rises to like
who you are inside yeah right like what
rises to the core of my skin and says
this is who I am you know like I got
trapped in an elevator once do with like
seven or eight people okay and this
sounds like a small idea but this was
like three hours right and suddenly like
a first one dudes kind of verbose he's
suddenly like I'm the leader but like an
hour later he's like trying to [ __ ] a
couple chicks that are also
in the elevator and you start to see
like okay he was trying to [ __ ] them
like it was hitting on them or he's
trying to actually get down in the
elevator no he wasn't kind of [ __ ]
over he was maybe gonna [ __ ] him later
if they got out of the elevator safely
not like a raper like a guy who's like
gonna date him or like take him to
dinner and then hopefully have sex with
him at some point if they want to as
well but he being on saying yeah
consensual sex yeah yeah there you go
but he but you started to see who was
who like one guy was like just literally
wouldn't listen anyone tried to rip the
doors open for two hours hit like just
like just like gave up on that like one
lady was really scared like immediately
it started to kind of fold out who was
gonna be who you know I wouldn't know
what to do I don't know if you're see I
don't think you're supposed to climb out
though that seems like death
right like to climb out into that shaft
you're supposed to stay yeah I know
you're supposed to yeah I mean they must
have some sort of regular but you know
of an elevator fell in one of the UFC
hotels like real far and [ __ ] up CB
Dollaway
one of the UFC fighters his back is
[ __ ] up from that apparently
apparently he's suing and I don't think
he fought that day I think they had to
cancel his fight I think I might be
wrong about that but I know his back was
like significantly [ __ ] up from that
fall elevators make it too easy man I
miss the old day sometimes when you just
he scratched from the fight yeah and
he's fought since but I think he's still
having problems with his back yeah yeah
it's hard to fix to a back it's one of
the hardest one of the hardest things to
make better again it seems like every
time people get surgery it's just a
slippery slope it's very rare that
someone gets surgery on their back and
they go oh my back's great now
everything's fine it's always like yeah
I got to go in again I got another disc
like oh no and state they're literally
getting their back fused from top to
bottom and they're back that are still
fighters too
yup no way Tito has several fused in his
neck he has artificial spacers from
where the discs used to be yeah he has
in his back his multiple operations on
his back do you think that that like
because some people think like you know
a lot of your Chi and you're like line
up is you know like your do you think
that that could alter knee of it yeah I
don't know I don't know if that's real I
don't know what is that is it is it the
actual disc gelatin or is the the spine
itself the spinal column where all the
all the nerves are firing all the way up
to the brainstem
yeah this really [ __ ] crazy thing to
risk if you think that about that like
the connection between your brain and
then that cord that goes to all your
body and everything moving and it's all
just this back area that very few people
ever even exercise yeah which is so
crazy
everybody's doing all this [ __ ] to get
your biceps look and fly and pump your
tits up and very few people are
concentrating on like lower back
exercises reversing Pipers protecting
your spine putting muscle all around
that [ __ ]
work that core do like kettlebell
windmills you ever do kettlebell
windmills no I do do that [ __ ] they're
so good
kettlebell windmills you like you press
the kettle button you go down and touch
your touch the ground by your foot and
then straighten Wow for your spine like
all the muscles around your back that
stabilize everything and your obliques
and your abs and all your core yeah it's
a great exercise I got to do more like
adult fitness man I got a G that's what
it looks like damn look at all that [ __ ]
that's a human spine Oh like I'm gonna
eat this in China next week anyway you
can have dick over there somebody said
they can you gonna have human a human
and dick Carroll what do you month said
that and he's eaten a lot of all he's
eaten every where is he Andrew Zimmerman
honored food guy yeah the podcast yeah
he's a chef travels all over the world
really cool guy
welcome this is that pictures [ __ ]
bizarre man to think that that's all the
stuff that's firing your nerves that's
crazy and what is that what does it even
look like it almost looks like a
jellyfish or like a it looks like it's
reaching for something doesn't it
yeah it's shooting off into the cosmos
son
thing at the top is making nuclear bombs
at the top is making 4G cellphones and
40 megapixel front-facing cameras I
think it's making that thing is making
time machines yeah that [ __ ] thing is
making satellite transmission of video
signals and simultaneously delivered to
televisions worldwide that's what that
thing's making dude you got things
making Tesla's Rory's making pistols and
steroids that thing's making oxycontin
that [ __ ] thing's making everything
that's what's tough about the human
brain areas that we yeah things making
whiskey that thing's making crystal meth
and crank things making nail-polish and
fake tits that thing is off the job if
you look at if you look to the human
brain for like all this [ __ ] is
responsible for you like what that area
oh my god and it looks like something
you would think maybe wouldn't even do
nothing if you walk by that on the
street you didn't know as a brain you'd
be like ah man that's one of the my
favorite out here
is Mars Attacks where they have their
exposed brain I can't remember that you
don't remember Mars Attacks I never seen
anything never saw Mars Attacks
from watch although this is one of the
greatest movies of all time it's Tim
Burton right is that who I believe is
why it's amazing it's so good dude
Jack Nicholson is in it and he please
place two obviously different people oh
really but it's obviously the same guy
playing two people and it's never
brought up no it's a great movie man I
mean it is a great great movie it looks
bad dude it's so good it's really it
seems like it looks back if you're
watching here but it's all on purpose
yeah it's all on purpose it's like when
the when this it's what it is is they
somehow or another captured how we feel
about this time period they captured it
with this weird like Vegas thing with
this is the president back then and when
these aliens come off this spaceship
it's there something about the way they
move that makes you think like you're
watching a movie from the 50
but still really good like just good
enough but what he did by making the
effects weird and barely real as he
almost gave you a nostalgia for like
1960s 1970s movie I can see that a
little bit right here yeah but but it's
better right it's way better than
anything they were capable of I mean
look at the [ __ ] the shadows on the
head and everything like that watch a
little bit of this real quick this is
when they first land
yeah
[Applause]
they came in peace
[Music]
[Applause]
on Mars
[Music]
that's cool do you think you'd eat
something from Mars if they had like if
they had it say this because I know
you'd like to be a wild eater I've seen
some of the stuff you eat you know you'd
five four
three two one the first man to smoke
marijuana never really smoked and he
inhaled it
he was a chinese man he was a very great
man and whenever he lit the the
the plant it wasn't to get high but he
would start to get high
and every time he got high a blue bird
would come to him
and tell him to conquer his neighboring
neighborhoods
and he listened to those to the bird and
that's exactly what he did and he became
a great emperor
in china and at that point in the story
pablo escobar looks at his doctor and he
goes have you ever been to disneyland
and the doctor goes no pablo i haven't
he gross
very clean very organized
whoa that's it but it's the truth the
first guy that ever got high was the
chinese dude that burnt the plant
because he liked the smell of the plant
it gave him a soothing but after days of
doing it
it packed up in his body and he started
hallucinating he saw a bluebird
a blue bird came to him and told him
that he had to conquer the neighborhoods
within the region what a crazy bird
he got high and a bird started talking
to him what are you gonna do you know
i don't know if this is true but this is
one of the things that uh
the pot aficionados always used to say
is that you know when a
priest walks down the aisle and they
have that that thing that they swing
and there's burning incense inside of it
that used to be weed
that's what they used to do in what
dimension
i don't know at one point i believe it
was weak
then it became that [ __ ] that batman
shot at the green hornet it was like
pedophile smoke you
you wake up your shirts bomb backwards
and [ __ ] your pants are missing
[Laughter]
well what did what is it now what kind
of incense is it now it's like this blue
smoke
i i go in there to church every once in
a while you have to go for the full
effect one like the five in the
afternoon on saturday
and the early morning and sunday they
don't break out the incense
they don't start breaking out the
[ __ ] maluki [ __ ] uh
and the guy comes out and one guy comes
out their own water jesus
and then the other guy it's so weird how
somebody made a great point on twitter
the other day they said
you me mitch hedberg there's five of us
that delivered newspapers
there's five comedians the delivered
newspapers you
hedberg did it yeah you delivered them
in a car to other places
i was an [ __ ] that took a route but
not the route in my neighborhood
to routing the neighborhood over so i
had to beat the kids there before they'd
get there and steal the papers
i would deliver them right to the doors
and oh you did too yeah yeah
and then you collected yeah i collected
from only a handful of people
most people were on like a monthly
subscription plan they they were
switching over
but the people that you'd have to
collect from you had like this envelope
like a tan envelope and you had to like
mark off
like you know when they owed things i
barely remember it because it was only a
couple of clients
and after a while i kind of got away
from doing them i said i don't want to
do these people that have because it's
too hard to collect it's annoying like i
don't want to i don't want to have to go
that was my specialty i didn't like it i
must have been that was
when i first got to the catholic school
and my mom gave me an option that i had
to go up there and work in the
afternoons and i'm like i got to figure
something out
i just don't want to go up there anymore
and my friend said i'm giving up my
newspaper up but he didn't give up the
one in my neighborhood
he gave up the one in the next city over
the next town over in that city
i could still walk everything so i'd
have to leave school and run over there
because i'm not the dude would steal my
papers
and sell them as their own on the
[ __ ] street corners
so i'd have to get them put the
circulars in put them in the thing and
then throw them on people's balcony and
then on fridays and saturdays
i have to go back with a ring after
dinner
and collect how you doing mr rogan i'm
here to pick up 75 cents and they give
you like 1.50 that was your tip
right and you got like 22 cents a week
for delivering the paper
did you collect from everybody i
collected from everybody i was there
sufficient what years were these
this has to be 73
74 75 yeah so i guess when i started
doing it is when i started driving
which had been like 83
i probably started 83 i probably started
when i was 17.
no that was 85 85 probably then that's
when i probably started doing it yeah
you're too old to be collected i
wouldn't pay you either
well it wasn't even that it was just
annoying like what you wanted to do
was go to the depot pick up the papers
chuck them into the people's driveways
and that's it and then there's a few
people that wanted it inside the door
so you'd have to get out of your car
open up their screen door put it in
there
and then leave and the idea was that
those people everybody would say those
people would tip you better those two
they'll tell you about it like okay and
so we would
only have like a few of those and
i think after the first couple of years
they stopped doing those kind of
collections or
i definitely stopped doing them but it
was an awesome job
when you're like a young comic or you
know even before i was
a comic when i was fighting it was just
uh i didn't have to do anything
where someone was telling me what to do
i could get in my car
i could listen to whatever i wanted to i
listened to charles lockwidera
he had the the morning the big mattress
on uh i think it was bcn i'm pretty sure
wbcn in boston this is awesome radio
show
i'd listen to that chuck newspapers out
windows i do that for like three hours
every day
you know it was the best job ever
because then i would make enough money
or i could pay my bills
but i still had all the time in the
world you stand up
all the time in the world train all the
time in the world do anything
but it definitely [ __ ] me up because
you're not supposed to be getting up
that early every day
like that can't be good for you you know
if you
you listen to people that know things
about sleep
like getting up at 4 30 in the morning
or five in the morning every day
and not being responsible that was the
beginning
to me that was the beginning of the new
joe rogan emerald podcast
that was the first podcast i listened to
that i agreed with a lot
but i also had a couple mitigating
factors
because i believe that everybody's
body's a lot different i know i could
rock and roll i could throw down on
seven straight
but it's got to be seven straight no no
no get up the p
two times because once you're 50 it
could be up and down
see once you turn 50 48 everything
changes papa
so if you see you're there at night i'm
drinking completely with water
that has to come out throughout the
night and you will be up all [ __ ]
night on the hour every hour there's no
rem sleep
yeah there's no rem sleep so you have to
come
once you get old you have to come uh
control your thyroid dog i've been a
specialist on sleep
since day one that was one of the most
interesting podcasts
you had on i bought the book and
everything and he made some great points
in there
i didn't i wasn't raised on an app joe
roger
my mom didn't raise me under that once
we came from cuba
my dad died there was no nap i went
where she went
right so my day consisted of eight to
three in the morning she had a manager's
room in the back of the bar with a cot
and if i got tired at one go back there
and take a nap but
i gotta stay here till three mommy got
to work wow
so my sleep was always horrific
then when i was like five or six
in school then i went to normal sleep i
went to catholic grammar school normal
sleep
everything was normal but my mom had a
bad thing that she did
my mom had an issue that a lot of
parents don't do when they work nights
it was she did it from the heart because
i have a friend who does it
wake me up at three in the morning joe
rogan joe rogan
get up i brought you black ink and pasta
which one julie from umbertos
and i brought you a newspaper are you
[ __ ] kidding me can you imagine if i
woke you up every night or two when
you're 26 years old joe
at 3 30 in the morning and you know i'm
doing it from my heart
and seven out of 10 times you're going
to get up and eat the scruggily or the
or the marinara sandwich i brought you
from leo's because they worked in the
city
so i remember if you bartend in new york
city on the way home what are you gonna
do you're gonna stop no you stop and get
two slices of [ __ ] the best pizza
there is in manhattan so my mom would
wake me up every night at 3 30 in the
morning
with a cuban sandwich
that killed me over the years that would
make me get up every night at 3.
there's still nights that i'll be
sleeping i'll get a good night's sleep
but i'll look at the clock and it's 3
a.m on the [ __ ] dot
because it's in my but like last night i
slept good
i [ __ ] up my sleep was bad after i
read the book for a while
that's how deep it got into my head so
when i went back to weight watchers i
realized i couldn't eat any more [ __ ]
edibles
because they wouldn't they would make me
hungry at night
i would [ __ ] go off the charts with
points so i stopped eating edibles and
joe rogan my sleep pattern changed
bad like my body did not
know how to go to fall asleep by itself
i went through a month of
[ __ ] two hours of sleep jesus
doing a bunch of [ __ ] and then three
more hours in the app did you try
anything did you try like melatonin or
anything like that
i did cocaine for 30 years melatonin
that i could eat 20 turkeys they could
all suck my dick
i drink them all together the tea the
vine
leave me alone please leave me the [ __ ]
alone all right
go [ __ ] yourself i got something that's
gabba gabba
the tea and the tryptopian put together
and they still don't find i buy it on
amazon
not bad so what i learned to do was
rotate it
so now i'm back on the animals i found
about an expired bag of cheaper shoes
like from the dave chapel tour when i
went out with dave jesus
i found the bag with about 24 oh my god
i slice them in half you take one of
those
you wake up at six in the morning to pee
your pee's brown
they're expired you understand me
[Laughter]
what happens if you eat expired edibles
same thing when you're eating expired
vicodin
listen to this listen to this listen to
this this [ __ ] ain't [ __ ] around
though
this works the jaw this is you're going
to fight joe schilling eat two of these

chance saturday night i ate another one
and i noticed your movie was coming out

[ __ ] what a phenomenal movie midnight
express
when they catch the kid coming back from
turkey with hash on his body
john rogan that is one of the most
hardest movies

goddamn
the first 30 minutes of that like i
thought i was gonna die
like when they let him go through and
they played him and as soon as he hit
the [ __ ] plane
they turned him around ripped his shirt
and they dropped to their hands and
knees and they gave him the seven years
and they started raping them
jesus but i watched up to the part where

the last day to [ __ ] live
this [ __ ] dude finds out they killed
that poor american's cat and he throws a
[ __ ] beat
on this left he did it joe rogan is one
of the most disturbing beatings there's
two disturbing beatings in film history
that's number two because he closes it
out because the guy was a rat
so after he throws a beating on look
yeah yeah yeah right there
he's spitting out the guy's tongue in
the air
and they showed it i gotta give a shout

save the guy's life
[ __ ] no you see him going
unless he just pulls up like this joe

look at him
oh [ __ ] are you [ __ ] nuts good
morning it's the fourth of july
you're [ __ ] with an american
[ __ ] even in turkey we lose our
five four three two one
hello Jordan Peterson hello mr. Rogan
hey very spiffy today thank you sir if
this is a new look for you you've been
rocking these a lot of these big
gigantic what do you call those things
those concerts you guys are doing what
are you with speeches
well lectures discussions as I think of
them as yeah yes I'm discussing I mean
you might think it's kind of perverse to
be discussing with a three thousand
person audience but it's not because if
you pay attention to the audience
they're constantly and the individuals
in the audience they're constantly
providing feedback so it's a discussion
as far as I'm concerned feedback in
applause laughter sometimes they shout
things out too or a shuffling shuffling
yeah well really what you want if you're
on track if you're where you should be
then it's dead silent and everyone's
focused and listening and so if that's
not happening I mean you know there can
be laughter or that kind of thing but
generally speaking you don't want to
hear noise from the audience
so if you're if you're onner if you're
pursuing a complicated topic and you're
paying attention and I'm always looking
at individual people in the audience you
know when the first few rows because
that's all I can see because of the
lights I'm trying to make sure that
everyone's on track with the talk and
you know there's people gesture with
their face and they gesture with their
eyes and they shake their head and they
nod and there's lots of things to pick
up and if you're not speaking with notes
you can really pay attention to the
audience and then you know if you're in
the dialog and that's where everyone
wants to be yeah it's an interesting
thing you're doing because you have
experience in doing that with lectures
and colleges and universities but now
it's the general public and people just
pay to see it
and you fill up these huge gigantic
theaters I mean I've seen some of the
places that you guys are doing it you
and Sam just got done doing one in
Vancouver and huge places antutu that's
right yeah back-to-back and yeah so it
was about five hours of intense
discussion over two days and you know we
were supposed to talk for an hour each
night and then go to Q&A
but we asked the audience Brett
Weinstein who was moderating ask the
audience if they wanted to go to QA or
continue the discussion and you know
that the response from the crowd was
definitely continued the discussion and
so we ended up talking for about two and
a half hours each night and again it was
the audience is along for the ride
mm-hmm you know and they were good
discussions as far as I'm concerned you
know it was kind of marketed as a take
down in some sense Harris versus
Peterson right but the discussion itself
was an attempt on Sam's part and my part
to further our thinking about the topic
and to bring everyone along for the ride
you know for the journey so to speak
yeah well you guys had two podcasts that
you did over the phone so this these
were the first meetings that you guys
had in person yeah it was the first time
I'd met Sam he said the first one that
you two had was marred by this
discussion about what is truth yeah and
it was a Lex a strange sort of you got
stuck you guys got kind of stuck in that
first conversation but I felt like the
second one was much better yes you mean
both of you kind of recognized there
were some errors made in the first
podcast yeah we ordered in on a
definition and yeah let it go and so
that wasn't so good yeah and I wasn't in
tip-top shape for that first discussion
well over for the second one for that
matter
mmm but they've been getting each
discussion I've had with Sam has been
getting better so as far as I'm
concerned and I think he feels the same
way and I mean we're chart we're trying
to sort something out that's really
really difficult and it's the
relationship between facts and values
which is parallel to the relationship
between say objective truth and a
narrative or parallel to the distinction
between scientific fact and religious
truth all of those things sort of are
layered on top of each other and it's an
extraordinarily difficult topic and so
it's not surprising that it's taking all
of this discussion to even vaguely get
it straight it's been a central bone of
contention among philosophers for well
probably forever but certainly since the
time of David Hume several hundred years
well what are the more fascinating
things is coming out of the realm of
podcasting is these kind of discussions
these long-form
live discussions in front of enormous
groups of people where you go over very
complex issues it's a new thing I mean
and it's it's something that's greatly
received by the public which is really
interesting I'm yeah you guys are
selling out all over the place yeah well
one one one I've really been trying to
make sense of this a because I'm
thinking well what the hell is going on
why why am i selling out 3,000 person
auditoriums and then and then but not
just me obviously Sam is doing it and
you're doing something on a larger scale
but very similar with your long-form
podcasts and and and then there's this
whole rise of what Barry Weiss described
is the intellectual dark web that's
actually Eric Weinstein is coinage and
so there's a group of us that would be
sort of clumped together for reasons
that aren't obvious but I've been trying
to figure that out as I do these
lectures another thing I'm doing with
the lectures or the discussions is
trying to continually further the
development of my ideas I use the the
stage let's say as a as a opportunity in
real time to think and I've been
thinking well if you're surfing you
don't confuse yourself with the wave
right that's that's a real mistake you
might be on top of the wave but you're
not the wave and I think this long-form
discussion and the public hunger for
that is best conceptualized like that
there's a technological revolution it's
a deep one the technological revolution
is online video and audio immediately
accessible to everyone all over the
world and so what that's done is it turn
it's turned the spoken word into a tool
that has the same reach as the printed
word so it's a Gutenberg revolution in
the domain of video and audio and it
might be even deeper than the original
Gutenberg Revolution because it isn't
obvious how many people can read but
lots of people can listen and now it
turns out so I mean you got a little bit
of that with TV right and you got a
little bit of it written with radio but
there was bandwidth limitations that
were really stringent especially in TV
where you could get 30 seconds if you
were lucky and six minutes if you were
stellar to to elucidate a complicated
argument so you can't do that everything
gets compressed to it to a kind of
oversimplified entertainment but now all
of a sudden
we have this forum for long-form
discussion real long-form discussion and
turns out that everyone is way smarter
than we thought right we can have these
discussions publicly and there's a great
hunger for it and I see this parallel so
and this would be what would you call it
supporting evidence for this hypothesis
the same things happened in the
entertainment world because you know TV
made us think well we can handle the 20
minute sitcom or maybe we can handle it
an hour and a half made-for-tv movie but
then Netflix came along and HBO as well
with the bandwidth restrictions gone and
all of a sudden it turned out that no no
we can handle 40 hour complex
multi-layered narratives where the
character shift where the complexity
starts to reach the same complexity as
great literature and there's a massive
market for it and so it turns out that
we're smarter than our technology
revealed to us and I think those of us
who've been placed in this intellectual
dark web group you know there's some
things we have in common we more or less
have independent voices because we're
not beholden to any corporate masters
except peripherally and we've been
operating in this long-form space and
the technology has facilitated that and
so all of a sudden it turns out that
there's more to people than we thought
and thank God for that I'm I'm
struggling with I want to I don't want
to use the word hate there seems to be a
non acceptance or a resistance to the
idea that anything of quality could come
out of this group of people it's really
interesting to me and I'm wondering why
when I listen to you speak or Sam or
Eric or any these people Ben or Dave and
I hear very interesting points and I'm
like why are people resisting that these
are interesting points why are they
resisting this and I think there's a lot
of people that are beholden to
mainstream organizations whether it's
newspapers or magazines or television
shows that feel trapped I think they
feel trapped by this format that they're
stuck in it's a very limiting format and
it's a format that in my opinion is like
I mean it might as well be smoke signals
or ham radio or something
it's [ __ ] it's dumb you know this
this idea that you gonna go to
commercials every 15 minutes and you
know and in between you have 15 people
arguing I mean I watched a panel on CNN
once and I think we counted 10 people
that we're trying to talk during this
five-minute segment I'm like who what
genius thought that it would be a good
idea to get ten people struggling for
air time barking over each other no
one's saying anything that makes any
sense because everybody's talking over
and trying to stand out and trying to
say the most outrageous things and I'm
seeing like some of the resistance to
this when we spend I mean pretty far
you know from Sam and I lean more left
and Ben leans more right and you're what
you would call a classic liberal and
Eric's very difficult to define and
Brett is fiercely progressive I mean
these are Brett in particular is a very
left-wing guy but this desire to label
and to have this diminishing label is
like all right or you know right-wing or
fascist is it's very strange to me well
there's a couple of things going on I
think one of them is that the
technological transformation that I laid
out and then the other is that I do
believe that especially for the radical
leftist types the whole notion of free
speech among individuals is not only
anathema but also something that isn't
possible within their framework of
reference I've been trying to think this
through very carefully because you know
free speech in some sense has become
identified as a right-wing issue and I
thought well how the hell did that
happen and then I thought oh yes well if
you're radically left and you're playing
the identity politics game there's
actually no such thing as free speech
because you're only the mouthpiece of
your group whether you know it or not
so you don't get to talk as Jill Rogen
you get to talk is like Joe Rogan
patriarchal white guy and that's it and
your audiences aren't a reflection of
your own opinions as an individual but
they're an attempt on your part whether
you know it or not to justify your
position in the power hierarchy and so
everything right now and this is where
the technology and the death of the main
stream media and and this and this
political polarization all unite
everything is turned into a political
conversation in the in the mainstream
media and media and it has to be cast as
left versus right and if you're
criticizing the left then all of a
sudden you're right and right-wing and
it has to be about politics it's like
well it doesn't have to be a pulp
politics it could be about philosophy it
doesn't have to be cast in political
terms and and then it's also subject to
a form of well it's made more stupid
than it has to be by these terrible
bandwidth limitations like I mean I've
been on mainstream TV talk shows and
it's very strange experience because
you're definitely content you know
Marshall McLuhan said the medium is the
message right the medium shapes the
dialogue and it doesn't in great and
great in in a tremendous way powerful
way you go on a TV talk show and maybe
it's an hour long something like that
and there's five guests and you've got
your eight minutes something like that
and you have to be bright and chipper
and entertaining and intelligent and
sort of glitzy and it puts that facade
of momentary charisma on you and if you
don't play that out you actually fail
right because you can't start a
long-form discussion when you've got six
minutes and if you're trying to talk
about something that's that's deep and
difficult well you want to talk about it
because you've got the access then and
the opportunity but you've got your six
minutes you can't help but turn into
sort of a glitzy entertainer and so it
cheapens everything and then the other
thing that I think is happening is that
as the mainstream media television in
particular dies the the quality people
are starting to desert like rats leaving
a sinking ship I guess they're good rats
if they're quality people but and then
the the there's evermore enticement to
use clickbait journalism to attract a
diminishing portion of the remaining
audience you know it's like one of the
things that's happened so if you look at
the five major indices of violent crime
in the United States they've declined by
50 percent in 25 years
it's absolutely beyond comprehension
it's so good this includes violent gun
crime by the way and yet the reports of
violence and media have gone up and up
and up and
I think well what's going on it's like
well it's it's its clickbait it's the
it's the equivalent of clickbait and
then to turn everything into a polarized
political discussion takes no real
intellectual energy but it's also driven
by the death spiral of the classic media
I think and I think that's actually why
the polarization seems to be so acute
now some of it is genuine but some of it
is some of it is the consequence of this
underlying technological transformation
and the death throes of the smoke
signals fundamentally what you're
talking about when you're saying people
especially radical leftist have to
concede certain points whenever they
discuss things that this is so true and
so important because you see that play
out over and over again there's very
little variation from the official
narrative when they talk about important
subjects or controversial subjects and
whatever they are whether it's you know
transgender rights or whatever whatever
is in the news that's that's big and and
and you know that it's very popular
right now there's these these certain
things that you're not allowed to
deviate from and that that's an insanely
restrictive perspective and it whose
establishing these norms like who's a
step question man yeah who is well I I
blame I blame the universities in large
part for this the activists disappear
but that's only a partial answer because
the universities are also responding to
legislation like title 9 so and and so
and so they've been driven into they
explain title 9 for people title 9 title
9 originally was just a piece of
legislation that that ensured that women
would have equal access to sports events
and so forth at the universities that's
what it was designed for but it's become
this umbrella legislation that pushes
equality of outcome essentially across
every possible dimension in the
universities and it's been used as a
weapon by the radical left but you know
some of that's driven by legislative
necessity with what's happening what the
reason that I think this is coming from
the universities is because I don't
think that this could well there's all
these activist disciplines that are
essentially subsidized by too high
tuition fees and also by state funding
and they've produced an entire
sub structure of activists and those
activists are doing everything they can
to lay out the theoretical structure for
the radical left and that's a that's a
structure that involves there's
buzzwords right diversity is one but
that means diversity by race and
ethnicity and sexual preference for
example as if those have anything to do
with genuine diversity of ideon and they
don't and there's no evidence that they
do inclusivity I'm never even sure what
that means
equity which is a marker for our what
would you call it it's a code word in
some sense for equality of outcome which
is an absolutely deadly doctrine I think
of all the mistakes that the radical
left are making and the moderate left
for not calling them out on it the
equity doctrine is at the top of the
list and then there's other associated
things like white privilege that's a
good one and systemic bias and which is
a it's an absolute embarrassment from
the perspective of a reasonable academic
psychologist because psychological tests
have been used to prove that there's
this implicit bias that lurks everywhere
and the tests aren't reliable and valid
enough to make that claim that's even
the people who've made the test the
implicit association test have admitted
except for mahzarin banaji who's the
chairman of the department of psychology
at Harvard they've admitted that the
tests aren't reliable and valid enough
to be used for the purposes they're been
using for and there's also no evidence
at all that these unconscious buying
bias retraining seminars have any effect
whatsoever that's positive it's all
nonsense pushed by this ideological what
fulmination zuv the radical left is
there any benefit in having these
conversations talking about implicit
biases and recognizing that there's an
extreme pushback against racism or
sexism and all these different things
and that even though these things these
these these ideas that they're pushing
might not be tested and proven the idea
of putting it out there in the
mainstream that there's a shift in
consciousness in terms of like how
people will or won't accept racism or
sexism or homophobia or whatever else is
being discussed that maybe it's far left
but maybe it's moving the needle towards
where it needs to I think that well that
I think that happens I mean I certainly
believe that there's space and necessity
for a constant dialogue between the left
and the right this is also something
that I've been developing more
particularly during these lectures so so
I'm going to lay out a couple of
propositions so imagine that you have to
move forward in the world you have to do
things and the reason you have to do
things is because well if you just sit
there and don't do anything then you
suffer and die so that isn't an option
you have to move forward you have to
move forward towards valued things so
you have to have a value hierarchy it
has to be hierarchy because one thing
has to be more important than another or
you can't do anything right here you're
to split with your choices so you have
to do things you have to value you have
to value some things more than others
then you have to act out what you value
in the social environment because you're
I try so hard boom and we're live
Hamilton Morris sober as [ __ ] how about
you absolutely say yes this time so we
did a podcast seven years ago and most
people apparently didn't know how [ __ ]
up we were but I figured damn we're here
with Hamilton Morris
we should go deep and we just kept
hitting that joint till I lost most of
my grasp on reality while we're talking
it's just a very slippery conversation I
was just too high to form coherent
thoughts it was just whatever I pieced
together was just you know it was almost
like miming a conversation uh-huh but
now seven years later and you have a new
place yeah it's beautiful
yeah we you were in the early days we
did it at my house yeah that was way way
way back in the day I had no idea really
I knew you were of course but I didn't
know about your podcast entirely I had
seen clips of you on YouTube and it
wasn't until I was driving home from
that recording and my phone just filled
with hundreds of emails that I realized
oh wow this is a serious phenomenon that
I was not aware of and now I see it's
just become huge it's a weird thing dude
it it's it's got the wheel I just sort
of have to show up it's a very strange
and it sounds like false modesty or
something like that but I'm just being
totally honest like this thing does
itself I think a lot of it might have to
do with the long form begins people are
so used to seeing people's opinions
condensed and filtered into these sound
bites and snippets and to hear an
extended conversation with someone where
they can actually tell stories and
articulate their opinions in a nuanced
careful ways so rare I agree it's one of
the reasons why I don't do those shows
anymore like panel shows and things like
that it's just so frustrating oh it's
insane I have very little experience
with that sort of thing but I did dr. oz
[Laughter]
yes and I don't know how any normal
person could function in that sort of
environment I mean I have a TV show so
arguably I'm
well trained for that sort of thing but
unless you're an actor who's prepared a
line to say as soon as they point at you
there's no way that you could function
because it's not a genuine conversation
it's just an opportunity to launch one
sentence sound bites and an audience
applause
yeah and also the audience is such a
strange element to add to a conversation
I mean if you and I were having this
conversation exactly in this this room
but to the left of us is an enormous
group of people we feel weird we would
have to address them we'd have to turn
to them it would be odd the following
illuminated applause and laughter
science God knows the weirdest when
there's always the warm up guys like
okay ready we're coming back from break
coming back from Craig and they hold up
the side and applause applause applause
and everybody goes crazy and they create
the worst environment I was on this
discussion about crow Tom are you
familiar with this I'm on it right now
oh wow yeah I just took some I [ __ ] my
knee up the other day I did something
and it's been stiff and painful so I I
stood before I came here and then I just
took took six of them see what happens
Wow okay 10 once I don't know can you
grab that bag there's a bag that's
sitting right on the sink I'll tell you
exactly what's in it but now I get why
people might think it's a drug what is
the drug yeah for sure but when I took
four I was like well I took two for the
first time I took it I took two and a
couple times I took two him with this
like a mild stimulant but then when you
get into the range of eight to ten pills
it's like oh this this will [ __ ] you up
this stuff the stuff I take is urban ice
organics and see it says it says take
two it doesn't say the amount of
material in the capsule 750 milligrams
okay so not quite a gram not quite a
grandma all right it seems like a
reasonable amount but they always
construct these things in these
ridiculous dramatic opposition's like it
was me versus a woman whose son had died
of some kratom associated
for DOS and you know it turns into a
thing like what do you have to say to
this woman whose son died it's like I
don't know you know there are people
that die from caffeine overdoses as well
it's tragic that this happened have
people died from this yes they haven't
you have to take an enormous amount I
mean I think a lot of people set up
these unrealistic expectations with
these drugs where they if they like a
drug they want to say it's impossible
right to kill anyone it's impossible
there's no possible way if you said that
is your standard you'll always fail
because people will die doing absolutely
everything running having sex defecating
aspirin aspirin absolutely there's
nothing in this world that can't find
its way into a human death so if people
want to say and even you know cannabis
obviously people say you can't overdose
on cannabis and essentially you can't
but if you look in the medical
literature there are a number of these
cannabis associated fatalities you know
you can debate them endlessly but the
point is once a drug enters a large
enough population
there'll be a number of sensitive
individuals and someone will die it
doesn't mean that the drug is dangerous
it means that it's unrealistic to set a
standard where if anything bad happens
to anyone we have to decide that the
drug is dangerous and should be banned
yeah I agree
I mean look water kills people there's a
lot of these hazing things where the
fraternity kids will be asked to drink a
[ __ ] ton of water and oh yeah the people
have died from it a woman died in San
Jose a few years back from a contest to
drink water to get her son like an Xbox
or something like that yeah yeah I mean
there's a lot of things that are lethal
but the ld50 for cannabis I mean you
literally have to smoke your bodyweight
or something right it's something crazy
be very difficult yeah but it doesn't
mean that you couldn't get so high that
you did something really stupid and wind
up dying right yeah especially dependent
upon the person and the the you know
biological variability right right
exactly and it's just I think it's also
just a sort of a bad road to go down
people always want to emphasize the
safety of things that in my opinion
safety isn't the point
it doesn't ultimately matter to me
whether or not something is safe I think
we should have the freedom to do
dangerous things if we choose
we're allowed to ride motorcycles were
allowed to shoot guns you're allowed to
go skydiving and bungee jumping all
those things carry risks but it's
assumed that any adult that does them is
aware of those risks yeah I couldn't
agree more I mean it's it's also who is
if the society that we live in was just
you and I is that we were the only two
people alive who are you to tell me what
I can do or me to tell you what you can
do it's ridiculous and so when you have
grown adults telling a grown adult who's
informed what they can and can't do then
it becomes a question of children well
then it becomes a an education issue and
it becomes a parental issue I mean it's
just you can't lie to your children
about the effects of certain drugs
because then they're not gonna believe
you about the really actual the actual
dangerous ones
Brayan and this is of course reflected
in the the so-called opioid epidemic yes
right now yes there's endless
finger-pointing everyone wants to find a
culprit that's behind all of it and the
easiest person to blame of course are
pharmaceutical companies because
everybody hates pharmaceutical companies
so why not blame them right but you know
and I'm not Pro pharmaceutical by any
stretch of the imagination but I'm also
not anti pharmaceutical either and when
you look at the way for example the New
York Times is covering the opioid
epidemic it's always in this tone of
like documents were uncovered this show
that executives at Purdue Pharma were
aware that morphine was addictive as
early as 1999 it's like well of course
of course they were aware people have
known that morphine is addictive for
hundreds of years this is old news and
this whole idea that doctors were
convinced by some letter in the New
England Journal of Medicine that said
that oxycontin isn't addictive is absurd
these are all morphine derivatives any
adult especially a medically trained
adult should know that no matter what
little variation you make on that
molecule if it's structurally and
pharmacologically and qualitatively
similar to morphine of course it's going
to be addictive and that in and of
itself isn't even a bad thing it should
be okay to give people addictive drugs
as well as long as everyone's aware of
the risks as long as they understand a
protocol to get off of it the you you
know there's so many people that get on
these things and then wind up taking
them far longer than they're supposed to
because it's easy to get
I mean we need to at least have some
sort of responsible direction that these
people need to go to to get off of them
once they're on them because people that
get back operations any anything where
they prescribe you high doses of opiates
it's a huge problem I know many many
people that have gotten hooked because
and in fact I should tell you that my
good friend Justin Ren his wife found
out about kratom because of you because
of your show he had a problem with his
shoulder got shoulder shoulder surgery
they put him on oxycontin's he was
[ __ ] up on them and he was having a
really hard time getting off and having
the shakes really bad and kratom is the
only thing that got him off of it right
and that's not surprising I mean this
has been known for a very long time in
Thailand and that was actually the
reason that it was originally prohibited
I don't know if you're aware of that but
because the government taxed opium and
people started using kratom then they
made Crotona leaves not the right way to
say it because people say kratom yeah
you're the only one I've heard sacred
Tom people in it's a Thai word people in
Thailand call it critic so people in the
US call it kratom it's a it's also they
have you know is maybe it's a quick Tom
something I'm not gonna go that forever
Cree tom is close if you did it would be
weird but I feel as you know yeah
like American people that say Ecuador
hahahaha Argentina but it is Krita yeah
crow Tom okay so we'll try to call Chris
or something close to that it's closer
to that than kratom right and so the
reason why was made it illegal was
because of the fact that it was pinching
some of the profits off of the opium
trade yes Wow
yeah that's [ __ ] up and so this has
been known for a long time that it helps
people get off more addictive opioids
and how does it do that well it's an
opioid itself and a lot of people don't
want to admit or acknowledge that but I
think we need to get beyond this idea
that drugs are inherently bad or opioids
are inherently bad just because the ones
that we're aware of have a lot of
problems you know in some sense
medicinal chemistry and pharmacology and
all this are still in a very primitive
state and there's so much to be learned
so we're mostly giving people these
derivatives of morphine that have been
around for a hundred years
and there are better things we're going
to continuously discover less addictive
treatments for pain and I think that the
alkaloids in kratom are a step in that
direction and which is so tragic that
they're trying to now make it illegal
because this is something that as far as
I can tell has genuinely helped an
enormous number of people reduce their
intake of more addictive and more
dangerous opioids one of the things that
I felt I mean and again my dose was not
extremely high but when I was on it I
was very coherent I was clear it was
clear to me that was affected by
something but it felt kind of good
it didn't feel bad it felt a little a
little uneasy like a little like whoa
this is what the world feels a little
weird right now
but it did not feel like I was impaired
like I know a lot of people who take it
and exercise like I have a friend he'll
take ten pills and exercise it just just
seems kind of [ __ ] crazy yes but he
says he has a great workout right by
taking that stuff before he works out
yeah I mean it seems to lend itself to a
lot of different applications in
Thailand it's used almost exclusively
for that sort of purpose in the south
it's a drug that labourers use so they
can you know collect it the latex from
rubber trees and just get their job done
that's what it's about I mean that's
what opioids are about for a lot of the
world both in the United States and in
Africa and in Thailand is you know
people live hard lives and manual labor
is painful and repetitive and difficult
and anything that makes that a little
bit more manageable is a very important
tool for humans I always felt like
people that did heroin or opiates or
some point that were on a very short
road to death that that was my
perception when I was a kid and then I
had a friend who was a longshoreman they
worked on the docks bringing they would
bring fish in and fillet the fish for
the market and he worked with a guy that
every day at lunch the guy would go cop
he would get his heroin he would shoot
it up in his car and then he'd go back
to work and I was like he'd go back to
work
you know he kept he worked everyday like
every day shot up and every day he
worked like yeah who's never late
nope just did his work all right Wow
well I didn't think you could do that I
thought you did heroin the next thing
you know you just be on the floor in a
fetal position in your own urine and you
just would fall apart and die right yeah
there's this idea that people sometimes
refer to as pharmacological determinism
that a certain drug has to do a certain
thing so alcohol has to sedate and dis
inhibit you heroin has to addictive and
make you a slave to it and kill you
cocaine has to be a euphoric thing
that's done at parties it's also very
addictive PCP has to make you strip nude
and run around fighting Compton fighting
cops and punching holes and wooden
fences but when you look at this you
know anthropologists have looked at
certain drugs that are used
cross-culturally like alcohol and what
you find is this whole idea of
pharmacological determinism is
fundamentally flawed
drugs behave differently in different
cultures depending on the set and
setting of the user and so you find all
sorts of instances that are major
exceptions to these rules that we've set
up for these various drugs for example
PCP which is arguably one of the most
ubiquitous ly maligned drugs in the
world I mean no one can imagine that PCP
is medicinal but even to this day PCP is
in schedule to not Schedule one like
cannabis and LSD schedule two it can
still be prescribed actually and that's
because it had a history of medicinal
use
there was even PCP psychotherapy in the
UK and in the 50s so this is a something
that most people wouldn't believe but to
those patients that were taking it then
there was none of this cultural
association with PCP being a drug that
causes psychosis or makes you strip nude
it was simply another tool for a
psychiatrist to use and help people
release repressed memories or traumas
that they were afraid to talk about when
sober hmm well we're seeing that now
with MDMA right I mean and also ketamine
ketamine you being used as an actual
tool for psychotherapy particularly for
people with depressions having really
good results my my friend hmm
excuse me Neal Brennan who's a hilarious
comedian he's had struggles with
depression yeah he got great relief from
from taking ketamine right and what I
think is really interesting is you know
this is often packaged as a sort of
psychedelic Renaissance but I think in a
larger context it's a drug facilitated
psychotherapy Renaissance because this
was not just limited to psychedelics
people did something called narco
analysis where they would give people
sedatives like propofol the drug that
killed Michael Jackson or various
barbiturates or various other drugs and
the relaxing effect would allow people
to talk more openly to a therapist and
it was considered very effective now
this idea of a psychiatrist injecting
you with a drug in order to help you
talk about your problems is it's unheard
of I don't think anyone does it anymore
but it used to be very common and I
think a return to that is going to be
really beneficial yeah I agree with you
I think the right drugs with the right
cases and the right people and I think
we've got to get past these schedules
that when you have things like marijuana
and psilocybin and and especially DMT
which your own body produces is a
Schedule one drug and the famous Terence
Mckenna line we're all holding you know
when it comes to DMT it's just stupid
it's just it's stupid that these things
are Schedule one when you're saying
there's no medical benefit whatsoever or
medical application for cannabis it's
[ __ ] crazy
when something didn't you want to have
something that really actively promotes
a distrust in law enforcement the
scheduling of drugs is one of the best
ones because when you look at something
like marijuana and you see that that's a
Schedule one drug that that that's
infuriating to people that gain huge
benefits from cannabis I mean people
that have going through chemotherapy
people that have you know inter ocular
pressure from glaucoma you can go down
the list over and over and over again
maybe kids that have epilepsy there's so
many people that have
had great benefit particularly from
edible cannabis from people that have
seizures I mean you could keep going on
and on and on it's just it's an amazing
plant and to have that demonized because
of some ridiculous propaganda from the
1930s that still somehow or another
clung on and 2018 you think about all
the information we have now with the
Internet and the fact that cannabis is
still scheduled one you have [ __ ]
like Jeff Sessions
still saying things like good people
don't smoke marijuana like this is crazy
talk it's crazy but keep in mind it was
just about a hundred years ago that
alcohol was prohibited in United States
and it took 13 years to reverse that and
that was alcohol there's no drug more
integrated into our culture than alcohol
and that took 13 years to reverse what
was that like back then that must have
been madness when alcohol was illegal
when the cops would come in and
jackbooted thugs would knock over gin
mills and bust open kegs of whiskey and
spill it all out like what the [ __ ] was
that like it was it was disastrous but I
think what's interesting about that is
it was a worthwhile experiment to give
them the benefit of the doubt it was
worthwhile to see because on some sense
you could say the prohibition has a
certain logic to it you could say drugs
going to the contender after Freddie
Roach oh really
yeah nice live boom we're live you gonna
wear headphones or no yeah it's better
you where are your cauliflower ears they
keep you from wearing earbuds uh-huh you
know those little feet go in your ear
does I need to it no I don't need it you
don't need it just keep this close to
your face and we're good all right there
we go
what's up man how are you fantastic feel
good I feel good I feel if it would not
be for my like also that I there would
be a I feel better than then I when I
was 25 what did you have your colitis
yeah collide is what is that what causes
that we don't really know what it caused
it but the best the best theory is that
before my last fight with Michael
Bisping I tried to put on weight extra
weight so I followed a diet program that
I was eating every almost every two
hours and I think your system is like a
car you know if you do a lot of mileage
it overuse it and then that's what
happened with the stress and everything
during my training camp a big problem
you know I couldn't sleep at crazy
cramps you know sometimes I had blood
even like when I went to the bathroom at
one point I had to go do some tests
because I was worried that it was
something more like I mean colitis very
serious but that it was I cancer or
something because I had blood so I did
some tests it came out negative and I
said to myself said this fight been
delayed not delayed but postponed so
many time that if I do something if I
say that publicly what is going on I'm
gonna lose the opportunity to fight for
the title yeah at 185 so I I keep it
shot and I told myself said whatever it
is I'll deal with it
after the fight so I did the fight
everything went well then after I went
to do it's called a colonoscopy they put
a camera inside of you yeah and I did I
got diagnosed with also colitis that's
probably the mix of the stress and also
the
fact that I was constantly eating I was
eating and not only eating Joe I was
trying to put on some weight it was very
hard sometimes I was I remember many
time I was having breakfast but I was
really regretting my breakfast I'm
chewing up because you just hidden too
much food yeah but I had to because I
needed to keep my 7 a certain weight and
therefore the crazy thing about it is
first now realize it's a mistake I
should never have done it but when I
made the weight at 185 the day before
the fight I could not go back up to 190
that's a the higher side was going back
up so the day of the fight I I woke up
and I add a little breakfast I drew up
my breakfast again Wow yeah well I was
really messed up then I went to weigh
myself I was like 191 yeah and what do
you think Mike wait he felt very strong
I mean it's not really the weight at
this time because you're the way that
you weigh right now depending what you
eat you have a lot of stuff inside your
your intestine and everything so and
also water retention I felt like I had a
lot of water retention and unnecessary
weight exactly so it's like the other
widest I got back that you carry on your
shoulder so what I should have done I
think is just stay the same way that I
am
my natural weight I think the body has a
way that it's his best way to perform an
athletic performance and that's what I
should have done right but it was a
mistake of my part it was a big mistake
so you were just thinking that because
you're going up to 185 and you're
fighting a guy in Bisping that used to
fight at 205 exactly he's a pretty big
guy exactly that I taught that to
perform better I needed to elevate my
weight but by doing that I created my I
created a big problem of health issues
so and that colitis didn't exist before
that and not that I got diagnosed for no
no and I think that that's what trigger
it and so after the fight now they've
gone back to a normal diet has it
changed so so I've heard a fight what
happened and it's very interesting too I
got in on medication and I I met a
doctor his name is Jason Fong isn't our
motto
people can research his amazing amazing
guy and I met a doctor that treat people
with cancer and diabetes with
intermittent fasting so I started doing
a program of intermittent fasting and
time restricted eating and on my symptom
diminish like every every weeks every
month diminish so he's got it's getting
better it's not 100% now but he's
getting a lot better a lot better and I
feel a lot better we had Ben Greenfield
on yesterday mm-hmm who you know he's a
journalist as a lot of experimenting
with his body not a lot of scientific
stuff and scientific research on diet
and in restricted eating is a big part
of it he does a lot of that it's
interesting because I'm we're a
conditioned to think that I want to when
I gain muscle and when I get you know I
need to eat more to accelerate my
metabolism but but I never felt better
in my life if we would not be for that
particular issue I feel better now I I
sleep better i inflammation and I also
did a test in January I went to McGill
University to do a scan of my my weight
my purse my fat percentage my muscle
density bone density and my in five
month I did it a few days ago like not
not this week the Tuesday of the last
week and my my fat percentage has
decreased my muscle mass has increased
and my weight is at the same hmm then it
wasn't January do you think this is all
from restricted eating my training did
not have change so the only thing has
changed pretty much is the the
restricted restricted time eating and
interpreted fasting yes yeah that
intermittent fasting gives your
digestive system a break and it lets
your body recuperate better I think
that's what helped me uh that mostly I
think it that's what it is a I felt like
I was like okay like I said like a car I
was putting too much for nothing and I
think as human being were over a fad I
I'm very interested about paleontology
and also a history and I know that human
being an ant or gatherer time then that
eat three meals a day no they need eight
maybe a few times a week but when they
eat they eat a lot yes I need to do it
fast so I think it's more natural for a
human being to do so and also I now I
read a lot of stuff and I watch a lot of
stuff on the internet about intermittent
fasting and time restrict the day eating
and I just wish I knew that before for
so many years I I I used to follow the
rules oh we need to eat at least three
time a day and you know I don't really
care of what I eat but I I've you know I
even though in the morning I I was not
hungry I was always my forcing myself to
eat which is bad you know yeah but what
has changed in your diet like what do
you eat like what's what's a normal meal
for you no I don't really I don't really
watch what I eat anymore
I it's more when I eat I try to eat
healthy but I don't have a specific diet
I like for example like Oh Tuesday I'm
gonna eat this this this it's on our
works I just try to eat LT you know like
I I try to eat good and of course I I
don't look at all this is a desert I'm
you know if I want a desert a chocolate
I remember that from one of your old
videos like you were having a glass of
wine during training camp you like
nothing wrong one glass of wine well if
you think about it joy I don't think a
glass of wine or anything let you know
before a fight were some we have the
tendency to be too much like oh what
should i eat what should i do this i
should i do that i think it's and it's a
chance to tense exact met when I went in
Thailand I met some some world champion
Thai boxer and they smoke they get drunk
before the fight I'm like you're
fighting tomorrow man it's like Zygons
like it's no problem but when you think
about it this is an extreme this is to
the other extreme yes but I don't think
it has that much of an effect you know
what I used to eat before like before a
fight my meal of choice before I got
into reading about
eating and stuff like that I was eating
a pasta before before 5:00 most of my
father I eat like fettuccine alfredo I
can that's a lot of carbs I mean it's
not babbling if you eat if you talk to
her for example a nutritionist would be
like oh my god we'll grab his head will
be like you serious oh my - Nikita you
see the steak and pasta before his
fights that was my thing I sweet pass
all the time and there's no problem with
that for me and I felt great but since I
start reading about nutrition and stuff
like that yeah it's like oh you need to
be clean and I'm like they never affect
me I don't think it has that much of a
big big effect you know it's more
psychological I think well it's also you
think about how much energy you're
burning I think for the average person a
bowl of pasta is not a good idea but for
an athlete that's about to fight five
five-minute rounds against a world-class
fighter you have different energy
requirements you know you have different
nutrition requirements you can burn off
way more fuel you know like I was
listening to Chad Mendes on the podcast
the other day and he was talking about
how he's so hungry he eats so much yes -
wakes up in the middle of the night and
he goes and eats sometimes Wow
he just can't he can't go a couple hours
without eating he just has this crazy
metabolism you know what since I
discovered I myristic restricted eating
and intermitted fasting now I feel
better by a training with an empty
stomach
I feel sharper up here mmm I feel more
creative especially in in jiu-jitsu feel
better feel lighter on my feet really
yeah man you do look first you just to
class the morning no no food in your
stomach I never have a food I haven't
eat today this is the coffee you give me
is the first thing I have so when will
you eat it's 12 24 right now after this
I'm gonna I'm gonna go train with
Freddie Roach and then I'm daily and I
and maybe I'll eat another time I'm a
late eater
that's why I'm not too good and I don't
like to eat too much early during the
day yeah I'm not really hungry I used to
eat because everybody eat but now I'm
like I'm not gonna eat since I have I've
discovered this I don't eat when I know
I'm when I'm not hungry and that thing
is why people eat is because they're
spike of insulin you
yeah so when you like when I start doing
intermittent fasting and time restricted
eating it was hard in the beginning
because I was conditioned to eat all the
time
yeah but my buddy acclimate to it and
now it's very easy I can eat once a day
it's no problem
like right now you know I could do it
and I think it's good to be hungry in a
way I remember the doctor who said
something to me said would you rather be
like a lion that just had a full belly
or an angry lion I'm like as a fighter
I'd rather be like an angry lion and it
makes sense to me if you look at nature
it makes sense you know what I mean
it doesn't make sense especially when
you do time restricted eating your your
body gets used to burning off fat - and
using fat as fuel it's true true that's
why I think when I did the test to
compare my my fat percentage diminish
and I didn't have much fat but it
diminished and the doctor I met he says
to him and say yeah I gained a lot of
weight he said you don't you think I'm
gonna lose muscle he says to me he
believed that the way that I put on
because now I'm about 185 pounds and I
when I train for Bisping and went up to
197 when I have to after their way and I
was I couldn't put back that weight up
so I was 190 he believed that the extra
weight that add was more water retention
and residual inside my body
it was not like a solid mass and it
makes sense to me because now I feel
much better and I'm just as strong and
even stronger like when I do Olympic
lifting much stronger gymnastic much
stronger
like I feel sharper yeah and you said it
reduced your information as well it does
have some time elbows you know like
problems yes it was a birthday what's a
birthday that was during my fight of
it's a guavas but I got a get a surgery
to take away the the residual that the
bone chip inside my elbow is not from
landing elbows I think is just use users
use but but now I don't have any problem
anymore
I know what
bill and like it used to be a chronic
thing that I used to fill some once in a
while sometime he came and it goes but
since I started this it didn't came at
all I felt great I can touch my him my
two shoulder like this no you came back
it's very interesting because with a lot
of people they take time off and then
they come back and you wonder what
they're going to look like but one of
the things that I was very hopeful with
you is that you've always been almost a
martial artist first in a fighter second
and in that you're always learning and
you're always practicing like you you
would always take time in between camps
and you would you know do jiu-jitsu in
Brazil or you would be constantly
practicing your muy Thai you're always
trying to learn and improve your game
and I was thinking when you came back it
was like if you were saying that you
were better than ever I'm like man he
might be better than ever like it you
you were the one guy that I believed
because a lot of times guys come back
and like man he's been out of the game a
long time who knows how hard he's been
training because a lot of Fighters when
they're not in camp when they're not
preparing for a fight they don't they
don't like to train that much because
they know the grind of camp
it's almost whereas I'm like you know
how you see a lot of fighters after they
retire they get really fat
yeah like wow how could he get fat like
I was looking at my Donna the other day
is a picture of Madonna's Chino mondop
Maidana
he's got a Instagram page he's fat as
[ __ ] he's got a cigar he's drinking a
whiskey I mean he just fought for him a
with her a couple years ago he was
ripped and this they retired they don't
give a [ __ ] anymore the way I want to do
this anymore but you I knew you were
still training because I would see like
in the hands of Gracie
the guys who were training with you
there and I knew you were training with
Danaher I knew you were constantly
training and you look good so it was
like that when I left off like more than
four years ago III knew I wanted to come
back the guy was not in a nappy place
had a lot of personal problems and I
should have even stopped earlier then
after my fight with Hendrix if if I
would have stopped earlier I would have
maybe come back earlier as well hmm it
was I was I felt like I was like kind of
a filling of a
claustrophobic feeling you know like it
I was I couldn't breathe well I couldn't
sleep well my mind pressure I had too
much pressure personal problems so much
stuff a lot of stuff happened to me that
it's still too early in my life and for
the respect of some people I know I
couldn't talk about it one day I will
all mix together I knew it was a drug
issue in the sport I feel I felt it
added fill well and I was trying to
perform under than those condition and
it was catching up to me yeah and I did
it but the reason why I think I didn't
lose the edge is a lot of people because
we do an extreme sport it's like what we
do is kind of life and death situation
it's not because there's a referee but
the Spirit is the same as a glittery
gladiator or a person in a war that goes
to war he thinks it's gonna die is the
same spirit even though it's not a same
thing we will go there in the same
spirit that we're ready to give it or
give it all it's such an extreme feeling
that once you don't have that in your
life life kind of become boring you feel
like you're not alive anymore so that's
why when people stop they retired and I
try to come back a lot of the people
they fall into drugs because I want to
catch up to that they want to feel alive
again so they want they need that
sensation you know that they had
previously but I couldn't get it back
unless they do drugs or they do
something crazy extravagant the thing
with me is I knew I was going to come
back and also I always like to train and
keep myself in shape and I never did
drugs you know like I never did art
drugs I drink I'm not I drink sometimes
my birthday last Saturday I went out and
I was completely wasted okay it is what
it is I like to date I rate myself
sometime I'm not perfect it's a little
fun exactly and I what's the goal of
doing this if you're not enjoying your
life what's a goal of it right I know
people do fight it's a no I don't like
to fight and that is another thing I'd
like to talk to you about because I why
you do that if you don't like to fight
it's like because I like my lifestyle
you know that it gives me but that's why
people I believe if you come back to
what you say
that's why I think people they have our
time to come back after so many years
because they fall into that trap right
they need to feel alive so then they
find ways to that they in make them feel
alive but it's the it's the Tyrian they
tear your rate themselves yeah
drain idea I didn't do that I did not do
that and I would never will hopefully I
can it's not my thing you know so when
you decided to come back how far out did
you decide like but you you you took
four years off yeah how many years in
were you like I think I'm ready to come
back when I see USA USA DEA and the drug
testing program being implanted and
implemented then I saw a lot of a lot of
late yes a lot of you feel huh like did
you feel vindicated when you saw like
some of these people just I feel a
little bit of a I mean it it feel bad to
wish people bad luck to get some kind of
recognition but that's not what I want I
want to do I don't wish people bad luck
but if you cheat you cheat man and they
a lot of people get cut and finally a
lot of people in the beginning including
my own friend they think like I was
talking some of my own friends they say
oh you're paranoid
you become paranoid you need to take a
break you you're going crazy just retire
get out you know they they you paranoid
because I was talking about it a long
time before Hendricks and they had
everybody was disregarding me but none
when it happened a lot of the champion
fell and a lot of the hero in the sport
they got pointed out with the finger as
AI is a cheater so now it become real so
when I saw that happen it was it was for
me a beginning to start and now it's
time to come back you know because I'm
I'm a guy
if I said something you know that's
become gonna I'm gonna do it I didn't
want to come back when the sport was
dirty that's one of my thing and so when
I when I decided to come back I had a
big talk with one of my trainer John De
Niro and I and for us there's my two
main guy and they're like my friend my
brother with me I mean I'm I'm
undefeated with this with these two guys
you know they're like with
I need them when I fight serious
and we're live what's going on did you
sleep well last night I did
I didn't sleep badly I mean hotels are a
tough thing and we actually know the
science that one half of your brain will
actually not sleep as deeply than the
other when you're sleeping in an unusual
room like a hotel room really that's
what [ __ ] me up when I'm on the road
you know I'll do three different hotels
in a week because I'll do like a
Thursday Friday Saturday like with gigs
and then by the time Sunday rolls around
I'm a mess in rough shape yeah is that
what it is
yeah and it's a you mean it's a threat
detection thing I mean if you look at
other species they can do this much more
impressively than we can
so dolphins or any sort of sea dwelling
mammal can actually sleep with half a
brain so one half of that brain goes
into deep sleep the other half is wide
awake that's how people the DMV do it
those people that work at the Department
of Motor Vehicles they're there they
work half asleep you ever meet them I
haven't no teasing your DMV listening
going [ __ ] you man next time you're
coming to get your license renewed
there's my next NIH grant I think
looking at the DMV and sleep but yeah we
si workers same thing same same type of
human that I've come across yeah damn -
I'm just kidding [ __ ] relax so when
you're in a hotel room what is happening
that you're half your brain is not
really sleeping yes so there's different
stages of sleep there are two principle
types one is non rapid eye movement
sleep or non REM sleep the other is REM
sleep which is also known as dream sleep
right and non-rapid eye movement sleep
is further divided into four separate
stages which are unimaginative Lee
called stages one through four we're a
creative bunch as much as it is true but
I think it's also although IQ but it's
the deep stages of sleep three and four
of that non-rapid eye movement that's
where a lot of sort of body
replenishment takes place brings the
cardiovascular system metabolism all of
those good things but that's the deep
sleep that
half of your brain will resist going
into when you're sleeping in a foreign
environment so it stays in this kind of
lighter stage almost like a threat
detection system and you can imagine why
you know it's an unusual context
evolutionarily it would make a lot of
sense to just have that sort of on guard
one half of the brain that makes so much
sense and that really for me it fills in
the blanks of like why even if I get you
know seven eight hours sleep on the road
I'm still kind of just out of it
yeah and that's in fact probably one of
the I think the most impressive parts of
new research on sleep it's not just
about quantity it's also about quality
and quality can be as detrimental if you
don't get it as a reduction in total
quality I mean both are essential right
but I think it speaks exactly to your
point you just don't feel like it's a
refreshing sort of deep sleep yeah it
feels totally different um it just feels
like I guess I would say it feels like
half asleep yeah it's really kind of
does feel yeah one of the things that I
noticed I did this thing with my friends
called sober October where we didn't
smoke any pot or do any no drinking at
all nothing for a month and when I did
it one of the things I found was that
after about I don't know how many days
but it was noticeable that I would have
these incredibly vivid dreams and then I
had read that marijuana does something
to suppress heavy REM sleep like what
what is happening there yeah so both of
those chemicals both of which it used as
a sleep aid alcohol and marijuana are
actually very good at blocking your
dream sleep your rapid eye movement
sleep and so what happens is that the
brain is quite clever in this regard it
builds up a clock counter of how much
dream sleep you should have had but have
not been getting and it starts to
develop this increasing appetite and
hunger for dream sleep so that finally
when the alcohol actually gets out of
your system sober October over the name
that's all of a sudden where you get
what's called a REM sleep rebound effect
where you not only get the normal amount
of REM sleep that you would normally
have
get that plus the brain tries to get
back some of that dream sleep that it's
been losing over the past maybe 11 11
months so you get this 20 years serum so
you get this REM sleep rebounded effect
and that's where you have these really
intense dream sleep situations yeah the
same reason that people will they'll say
like I had a bit too much to drink last
night maybe it was a Friday or Saturday
they sleep in late they say I just had
these crazy dreams mmm what happens
there is a kind of an acute version
where the alcohol is swirling around in
your system and after about six hours
your liver and your kidneys have finally
excreted all of the alcohol and your
brain has been deprived of dream sleep
for that first six hours so then it
feasts in the last couple of hours and
that's why you have these really bizarre
dreams after you've been drinking a
little bit too much oh wow so but what
is happening with marijuana though
specifically do you know yeah so
marijuana it does help people will help
it it puts people to sleep quicker
although I think that the question is
whether it's really natural istic sleep
or not that they go into certainly with
alcohol it's not that nightcap idea is
is a misnomer alcohol will actually well
it's a form of drugs that we call the
sedatives and sedation is not sleep it's
very different but we often mistake one
for the other marijuana it seems to act
in a physiologically very different way
it doesn't target the same receptors in
the brain so it's unclear whether this
speed with which you fall asleep after
having a session with marijuana is
actually natural sleep let's assume it
is the problem however is that it then
will start to disrupt REM sleep it will
start to block the process we think
perhaps at the level of the brainstem
which is were these two types of sleep
non REM and REM sleep will actually get
sort of worked out that's where
marijuana may actually impact dream
sleep and shut it down and block it have
there been any Studies on chronic
marijuana smokers like those
dawn-to-dusk type characters that just
are constantly high like and what
happens to their brain from not because
they must never hit REM sleep he
so people haven't looked at marijuana
they have looked at alcohol though mmm
exactly that so what happens is if you
look at alcoholics they will have
something often when they come off
alcohol something called delirium
tremens which is where the sort of DT
there what happens is that the alcohol
has been blocking dream sleep for so
long and the pressure for dream sleep is
built up so powerfully in the brain it
actually just spills over into
wakefulness and so the brain just says
look okay if I'm not going to get this
dream sleep whilst you're asleep I'm
just going to take it whilst you're
awake and so you start to essentially
dream while you're awake it's this sort
of collision of two states of
consciousness so you get delirium Wow I
always thought the DTS were detoxing
other when someone said someone's going
through those three T's okay yeah so
it's delirium tremor yeah delirium
tremens yeah I'm sort of mmm so what
like what is going on with them when
this is happening so if they are going
through this delirium during the day
while they're conscious what what's
physiologically happening so it's almost
as though the veil of REM sleep gets
pulled over the waking brain as it were
so you have this mixed state of
consciousness that you can pick up with
brainwave recordings and it just tells
me I mean in some ways how necessary
sleep must be if that's the lengths that
the brain will go to to get that which
it's been missing you know just shows
you why you know it took mother nature's
3.6 million years to put this thing
called any tower sleep necessity in
place and we've come along and within
the space of a hundred years we've
lopped off almost 20% of that if you
look at the data Wow really yeah and so
many people take pride in that too I
don't need a tower sleep
I got three I'm good ready to go kick
ass and dominate the world yeah yeah
it's the sort of like sleep machismo
attitude there's a lot of that right
yeah it's me baby I like sleep well I
mean you'd be glad to know that then you
know men who sleep five to six hours a
night will have a level of testosterone
which is that of someone ten years their
senior
hmm so a less tough sleep will aid you
by a decade in terms of the critical
aspect of wellness virility muscle
strength years that's incredible
Wow we had a woman on the podcast her
name is Courtney de Walter and she's a
ultra marathon runner and she ran she's
a real freak I mean like an incredible
athlete
she ran this thing called the Moab 240
its 238 miles through the the Moab
mountains and she did it 22 miles faster
than the second place man
so she wanted by like a whopping I think
it was ten hours ten hours ahead of the
second place winner and she slept one
minute one minute the entire time she
tried to lie to this over three days I
think it took her less than three days
thing took her like two days she slept
for one minute during the entire time
but she tried to lie down she said she
laid down for a few minutes but she
couldn't fall asleep and then she wound
up actually just taking one minute and
going to sleep and she said that one
minute was like one of the most intense
restful minutes after that minute is
over she was woken up cuz she told her
partner a running partner to wake her up
at a minute and she's like how long did
you let me sleep and he was like one
minute she's like wow I feel great let's
go but she was saying that she
hallucinates and that she starts seeing
like rabbits or talking to her and she
sees things that aren't there and like
mystical beings and stuff she said it's
really freaky but she knows that she's
hallucinating because she's done this
she's done a bunch of ultra marathons so
she just keeps going she just keeps
going and she's like saying hi to
rabbits they're talking orange stuff
yeah I mean and you you see these
reports too I mean there's a there's a
race of cycling race of things bike
across America you just got to go from
East Coast to west coast in a shorter
time as possible and that's exactly what
they do to it's all about managing how
little sleep that you get and they will
explain these wild hallucinogenic
experiences on the bike if you look at
world records for people who have tried
to sort of go without sleep and one of
the most famous examples is a radio disc
jockey called Peter
trip back in the news back in the sort
of 60s 50s 60s and he tried to break the
world record he went eight days straight
and yeah no sleep yeah he was
broadcasting from Times Square
and he would do his show there and you
know the scientists the psychiatrist
said look this is a very bad idea based
on what we know please don't do it and
he said I'm gonna do it anyway and then
the scientists being the good scientists
they said great Jemaine if we study you
could it'd be a great paper to sort of
you know to write up and they tracked
him and by day three he was having
florid delusions and hallucinations he
was seeing spiders in his shoes he
became desperately paranoid he started
to think that people were trying to
poison him in his food one point it was
the middle of winter some guys came in
with sort of these bears in New York
wintertime came in with these big
jackets he thought it was the Secret
Service coming to get him and he ran out
into the road huh you know these are
strangely but so we know that that same
profile of just starting to become you
know psychotic which is essentially what
happens naturally when you dream that
you are I mean all of us here you know
as long as we slept last night we came
flagrantly psychotic when we went into
dream sleep because you start to see
things which are not there so you
hallucinate you believe things that
couldn't possibly be true
so you're delusional you get confused
about time place in person so you're
suffering from disorientation you have
wildly fluctuating emotions something
that psychiatrists call being sort of
effectively labile and then how
wonderful we both woke up this morning
and we forgot most if not all of that
dream experience so we're suffering from
amnesia what is happening when you're
having these hallucinogenic experiences
like what are the chemicals that are
causing it do we know we do it yeah and
we so we've done some of these studies
where we put people into brain scanners
we let them fall asleep and then we see
what happens within the brain which
parts of the brain is switching on which
parts of the brain are switching off
when you go into REM sleep firstly some
parts of your brain become 30% more
active than when you're awake so it's
you know we think of sleep as this sort
of you know static passive
state where everything just kind of
drops down in terms of activity it's
quite the country but what's also
interesting is that not all parts of the
brain ramped up when you go into REM
sleep visual parts of the brain increase
motor parts of the brain increase
emotional centers and memory centers
they all increase but the part of the
brain that bucks the trend and goes in
the opposite direction is the part of
the brain that we call the prefrontal
cortex this sort of CEO of the brain
that's very good at rational logical
thinking that parts of that part of the
brain gets shut off so it's almost as
though you know that the prison guards
are gone and everyone runs amuck
because there's no controller you know
in place and so we know sort of from the
patterns of brain activity why you
become sort of so visual you see things
why you have motor kinesthetic activity
why things feel it's so emotional but
also why things seem utterly illogical
and irrational because your frontal
brain the thing that makes us most human
you can say goodbye to that for the rest
of dream sleep so there's no driver so
there's no driver yeah now why do we
forget why do we forget those dreams
because I I wake up and I am sure that
I'm gonna remember these dreams and
sometimes I do sometimes I remember and
I don't think I really remember them I
think what it is is very much like you
ever hears someone talk about a memory
from a long time ago
I used to think that people actually
remembered things from a long time ago
but now what I think is they remember
remembering it mmm I think they remember
talking about it they remember how they
described it and then they sort of
remember that and repeat it and in their
mind convinced themselves that that's
what happened because I've heard people
tell stories about the past and they're
they vary wildly from what is absolutely
true like like factual you could check
it you could research it you know what
the facts are but in their mind it's
very different and I think that it's
entirely possible that what people are
doing is remembering the recollection of
these memories and how they told them
and then also sort of people
library things that makes themselves
look better or make the situation look
more dramatic but with dreams that
doesn't make any sense so I was I'm
always trying to figure out like what is
it about a dream where sometimes I can
remember the dream and sometimes it's so
vivid when I wake up I'm like holy [ __ ]
that was crazy what a dream and then I
forget 20 minutes later right what is
that
so firstly I mean one theory of dreaming
is that it's just simply a
reconstruction when you wake up so you
have these fragments of activity and
what your cortex does when it wakes up
is what your cortex is designed to do
when you're awake normally which is try
to package everything can make a good
story make logical fit out of the world
that's one theory I don't believe that
though you your point is a very
interesting one do I remember my dreams
that doesn't necessarily mean I forget
my dreams and what I mean by that is
accessibility versus availability so if
you haven't had that experience where
you've woken up you thought I was
definitely dreaming I can't quite grab
it you know it just and it's gone mm-hmm
and then two days later you're in the
shower you said of washing yourself you
see a bottle of shampoo you see the
label and it just triggers the unlocking
of that dream memory and it sort of
comes flooding back or someone says
something to you you think oh that was
the dream yeah what that tells me as a
brain scientist is that the memory is
there it's preserved it's available but
what happens when most of the time when
we wake up is that we lose the IP
address to the memory so it's present
but it's not consciously accessible
available not accessible if that's true
what it means is that this type of
information we know can have
non-conscious impacts on our behavior
all the time there's great brain science
about this non conscious memory
processing it's possible that we store
every one of our dreams we just don't
consciously have accessibility to it but
nevertheless it's changing how we behave
how we feel each and every day no
evidence for it it's a theory I'm still
wanting to test but that's possible too
and it's only that anecdote where I can
think
just don't remember the dream I
forgotten it I don't think that may be
true it may still be there I just need
to find the keys to XOR to access that
memory what's stunning to me is how
quickly the dream evaporates the memory
of the dream in relation to an actual
experience like if we went outside and
we saw some lady walk up to some guy and
kick him in the balls we'd be like whoa
we would remember that and that you
needed to be able to tell your friends
like yeah some lady just randomly walked
us some guy and kicked him the balls
like we would remember that and you
would remember it ten minutes later
you'd remember in an hour you'd remember
it yes next day you'd be telling your
friends yeah she just walked right up to
him I remember it like it was yesterday
cuz it was right yeah but a dream gonna
be ten minutes ago and you wake up and
dude it was King Kong and he was he was
swinging from my ceiling and somehow
another thief it in the room but the
room got bigger and you have these crazy
dreams and then 20 minutes later you
forget all of it like what is happening
there so one-one current explanation is
that the chemistry of the brain when you
go into dream sleep is radically
different yeah so one of the chemicals
called noradrenaline in the brain which
downstairs in the body it's sister
chemical is called adrenaline
noradrenaline actually plummets to the
lowest levels it's actually it's a
stress chemical in the brain it's one of
them that gets shut off during dream
five four three two one
boom and we're live thanks for doing
this man I appreciate it
hey thank you for having me I appreciate
that he's the only guy I've ever had in
the studio where when I showed up you
were working out that's what I do mask
my life that's my life it's pretty crazy
though I mean how much time did you have
when you got here I got here about an
hour early oh yeah okay so I got here
shirt off doing chin up hilarious I
think if I camera out in time for you
song I wanted to take some pictures well
maybe next time
next time well catch you after the show
you are a guide that for a lot of people
you sort of embody the idea of hardening
your mind and figuring out a way to do
things that most people think are
impossible
all right let's you've sort of become
that guy over your life and you've
become that guy for a lot of people
including me online we've talked about
you on the podcast a ton of times so
having you in here has been it's very
exciting to me I appreciate that thank
you how'd you become that guy you know
what I grew up not that guy yeah so a
lot of people put a title on me they
want to they see me now they see me now
as the guy that with his shirt off who
can do 4030 pull-ups in 17 hours you can
run tours in five miles in 39 hours who
can do all this crazy [ __ ] but what they
don't understand is they don't
understand the journey that it took me
to get to this point and what got me to
this point was I was just the opposite
everything the day I was that guy who
ran away from absolutely everything that
I got in front of me but not many people
knew that I had two people at the like
the real me was like this very scared
insecure stuttering got beat up by his
dad all this kind of stuff and I built
this fake person that walked around like
my [ __ ] didn't stink you know you know
that yeah so that was that's kind of how
I did it and I do the process of time I
realized that I was lying to myself and
lying to people but that it's a
fascinating journey though because
you are that guy now Ryan you genuinely
are legit badass right at one point in
time you were a legit terrified person
yes so what was the process like how did
how did you step forth well it's a it's
a long process right um I my dad beat
the [ __ ] I mean was growing up we I was
the first black baby born in this
hospital called Millard Fillmore in
Buffalo New York my dad owned skating
rinks he owned bars he ran prostitutes
from Canada to Buffalo New York my dad
was a big-time pimp big-time anything
bad about a person
big-time hustler he was American you
know that I'm with them Denzel
Washington he was that but not that bad
right yeah he wasn't that big but that's
what it reminds me of he was that kind
of guy and beat the [ __ ] out of me did
she help you no I love my mom there was
an instant one time when my mom got
knocked out on top of stairs and they
drug her down the stairs by her hair at
six years old
I'll never forget this in my mind I was
always afraid my whole life I was afraid
but I had this [ __ ] voice this this
conscience that would always be battling
me said hey you got to get up and do
something I didn't want to do [ __ ] you
know I was just afraid but I would that
that voice would forced me to get up and
my dad you know I try to beat him up
whatever at six and I get my ass kicked
so this went on for several years and I
have a big time learning disability can
my dad didn't believe in us going to
school so my dad it was about the
business the skating rink in the bar so
this game you open about seven o'clock
at night and this is when time I was
able to walk so about five you know four
or five six years old eight nine and I
go to the skating rink it's ten o'clock
at night and I worked the skating rink
until 10:00 at night and then we would
scrape the gum off the floors and we
cleaned the whole skating rink up and
then my dad at the office and my brother
and myself asleep in the office and my
mama go upstairs and worked the bar
until three o'clock in the morning and
then they cleaned the bar up so after
all that [ __ ] was done with going to
school really happened so when I went to
school I was all kind of you know my
learning disability I had social anxiety
I was just a jacked up kid from living
in this tour
at home from the outside looking in we
live in the all-white neighborhood and
then we would travel to the ghetto of
Buffalo New York with the skating rink
was that so we you know we worked around
mostly blacks and I lived around mostly
White's but no one knew what was going
on the house that on 201 Paradise Road
yeah it's crazy but um my mom got
courage to finally leave him when I was
by 8 years old we moved to a small town
in Brazil Indiana and that's when the
real war started for me and Brazilian is
a small town great people a lot of great
people and I say that because like
people get offended and I'm gonna get to
the point where they get offended there
was about maybe 10 black families at
about 10,000 people in the town and in
1995 the KKK marched in the 4th of July
parade so this was a not every bar was
racist there's a lot of good people some
the best people I knew was there but
there's also a lot of racism there so me
being one of the few black kids net you
know in the area you know it kind of
haunts you I had stuff on my notebook
you know [ __ ] we're gonna kill you on
my Spanish notebook they had that on my
car [ __ ] this is early 90s and so even
though I sold it didn't hurt me
it was jacking me up so all the
insecurities I have when I was a kid
with my father I moved into this area
here and it just got worse and worse and
worse and it [ __ ] haunted me and that
voice that talked about it kept talking
louder and louder and louder I was doing
nothing about it and I decided to make
moves and I cheated all through school
and it's kind of humbling to talk with
my stories sometimes in this um it's
also embarrassing but it's real it's who
the [ __ ] I am is what I am is what
created me and copy from the fourth
grade to the to my junior year in high
school on every assignment and I want to
get in the military I'm gonna join the
airforce and the guy gave me an as vapp
test as I could water down SAT and I
couldn't copy on it because the guy
beside me how to test a test B they got
him I write he had test C so I looked
the copy on this test and I couldn't
copy on so I got like a 20 and I wanted
to be an Air Force pararescueman it's
guys that jump out of airplanes and save
down pilots it's a
it's a special operator in the Air Force
and my squirt was so horribly low that
is we take it again
and he said hey I got an 18 the second
time even worse I need to get a 50 out
of a 99 and so a mom and I for a while
we lived in the government subsidized
apartments seven dollars a month and
also food stamps and we slowly moved up
to a $230 a month place but at the time
you know we you know pretty poor but um
my mom afforded enough money for me to
go to see a tutor one one hour a week so
for four hours a month it had six months
to study from our last test I can only
take the best you know the answer to
test three times and I studied my ass
off and passed it I got in the Air Force
and realized there was more things in
front of me I was afraid of water
terrified the water and I've learned how
to swim but what gets everybody in this
training in all special ops training is
the water confidence where they try to
pretty much drowned your ass you know
all of our lives we've been breathing
and they take that from you and they
want to see how comfortable you are in
the water and there's a 1%
african-americans in Special Operations
and I didn't know anything about African
like a lot of them are negative buoyant
which I am because the bone density I
struggled but I'm six weeks into the
program there was about 25 guys left of
about 150 I was there and I was never I
didn't gonna sleep for six weeks of the
program and I wanted to quit so badly
but I quit everything in my life I
copied through school I want to prove
people wrong and so here I am in this
Air Force program start to get a little
more confidence but this water was
kicking my ass
and six weeks in the program the doctor
gave me a blood test and must have
sickle-cell sickle cell trait not the
anemia but I still killed people but so
they pulled me out training for a week
and when you go from being very
uncomfortable in that water situation
and then now you're comfortable and I'm
sitting back watching the guys drown I'm
not you know I'm not part of the
activities anymore for this week I don't
want to get back in that damn water
again so the fear overcame in all my
insecurities for my dad from this small
town from everything started coming back
and even though no one knew how [ __ ]
up I was kind of create this other
person
tough I live with this [ __ ] all time so
mean I wouldn't go back in that water
the doctor called me a backup I thought
to get like a like a medical kick out of
the military so no quitting for me they
kicked me out so I can have some pride
the doctor said no I'm kidding you know
we could put you back in the training
and I was like [ __ ] but after a week I'm
like you know what I missed one week
there's only three weeks left there's a
good chance you know I could tough this
[ __ ] out and go on but I went back to
the CEO and the commanding officer of
the program and the sergeant said hey
you gotta start from day one because you
missed you know that that week of
training and I broke
I broke I couldn't imagine going back
through that again
so I made up a lie and I said man
there's sickle-cell things really
scaring me it was the [ __ ] water it
wasn't sickle cell and and I pretty much
quit even though they gave me a medical
and I quit so um from the age of 19 days
of 22 I went into the job called tack
pee where you control fast movers behind
enemy lines cool job but there's no
water I was afraid of water so I've
avoided it and I gained 125 pounds in
that time frame
I went from 175 to almost 300 to 297 was
my heaviest and I started finding things
that was comfortable and the more things
I found comfortable the more
uncomfortable my mind was because that
voice I was telling you about it always
was there I was trying to avoid that
conscience I wanted to be left alone
from that conscience and it wouldn't
leave me alone so I got out of the Air
Force and I started working for a job
called ecolab respray for cockroaches at
24 and I'm spraying at different staking
sheiks Red Lobster whatever from 11
o'clock at night at 7 o'clock in the
morning and what changed I came home and
watch this Discovery Channel show class
224 I came home from Steak N Shake I
sprayed it down last get a big ol large
42 ounce shake walk across the street
and get a box of mini doughnuts from
7-eleven you never drive home for 45
minutes this big old fat guy who yeah I
worked out but I was fat I didn't run
didn't PT I just hit the gym so I'm
driving
home turn the TV on and what comes on
Discovery Channel so and that's what
everything changed for me I was taking a
shower I walked out heard these guys and
I watched the show and it made me
reflect big-time on the piece of [ __ ]
that I am and I'm exactly what people
said I was going to be so so what was on
this show that really struck home it was
um I saw these guys going into water so
I was terrified of it I can't even
express have you ever had a big fear and
I know a lot of fighters have fears and
stuff like that but they get over them
but all of us have these fears that you
just don't want to [ __ ] face and um I
have a lot of them had a lot of them and
that's what created the person who's in
front of today and we'll get into that
but I'm just a scared [ __ ] is what I
was and but I was watching these guys
going through hell week class 2:24 and
these guys ringing the bell quitting
dropping their helmet down rolling out a
lot of guys is leaving and it made me
reflect on my fears my insecurities and
I saw real men when I thought were real
men who were staying who were overcoming
adversity who were overcoming all these
different things that I had blamed so
many [ __ ] people in my life my dad my
mom for not being there when I was 14
years old my my mama's would get
remarried to this great guy he got
murdered and then I moved back to a
small town in Brazil and and I everybody
was a blame my learned disability my my
skin color you know me being everything
and so I sat there for a while and I was
like man I gotta [ __ ] I got it
no one's gonna [ __ ] come to help me
no one's gonna [ __ ] come to help me
his [ __ ] me against me period and I'm
so I had to man up and I said first
thing I started doing is facing every
[ __ ] fear I have no matter what the
[ __ ] it is man and these things would
keep me up and that no one people who
are here in this [ __ ] day they will
never really understand and grasp when
you face these things and so many things
how they keep you up and haunts you at
night I think there's a lot of people
out there that know what you're talking
about I mean and so that's what it did
and I had two options to either be that
300-pound guy who spray for cockroaches
and
thousand dollars a month and at 24 years
old knowing we're not 50 [ __ ] years
old I can reflect on this and think
about what God never became or I can
totally just sack it up and fail and
fail and fail entire succeed so I
started calling recruiters up I said
we'll be a [ __ ] Navy SEAL and every
recruiter so there's a weight and height
so they weigh weight and height limit to
get in the military and I was 6 foot 1
and to 97 and I had prior service which
was a big deal so I called all these
recruiters up and all of them said hey
how tall are you bla bla they got into
conversation and see if I even qualified
and by the time I got to my weight phone
we were hanging up pretty much like hey
you know what call somebody else you
know try to get in the reserves so I
tried to get in the reserves and I
called this guy named Steven salad your
recruiter up and he said hey come on in
he saw me put me through the weight
standard all the sort of stuff and to
get into the class I had to get into how
to lose 106 pounds in less than 3 months
so I was like [ __ ] that I can't do that
I grabbed my chocolate milkshake and
went back to Ecolab I'm going back to
work man this is my life
so in this job you look you know you're
looking for cockroach she's looking for
rodents and stuff like that and this
next morning or this next night I went
to work and I hit the all-night
cockroaches too much I hit the mother
lode of cockroaches and this restaurant
got full of cockroaches and rodents and
everything else and I sat there and said
this is my life I said this is my life
you are exactly who the [ __ ] that this
is it and I said this ain't gonna be it
for me so in that restaurant I quit my
job left my canister in that restaurant
my spray canister got back in my ecolab
truck and I went home and I started
working out like somebody I was I became
the most obsessed person on the planet
Earth that was basically I had to invent
a guy that didn't exist I had to invent
a guy that can take any pain any
suffering any kind of judgment be called
[ __ ] be called whatever the [ __ ] in
the world and be understanding the
[ __ ] room and said go [ __ ] yourself I
had it built the I had to build this
callous mind and I built it to suffering
I built it to downright [ __ ] just
crushing myself if it was raining
outside three o'clock in the [ __ ]
morning feeling the first instinct is
don't go out there and do [ __ ] my
instinct was we gotta [ __ ] go out
there anything that was [ __ ] horrible
in my life that I would normally say no
that was inhumane that most people I had
to go do it and I started callous in my
mind at this point in my life and I lost
the weight I lost the weight and I went
back to recruiter I got into that class
and I went through three Navy sohail
weeks in one year only God ever be in
three hell weeks in one year after my
knowledge the first one I didn't make it
through the next two I did and that I
just didn't stop anymore from there
and I started realizing through this
through this process that the [ __ ]
mind is what you created and I started
opening different doors that I didn't
think we're even there they didn't think
even existed and the more doors are
opening up the more I start realizing
that my potential is damn near endless
and it changed my whole mindset so I
went from David Goggins and I created
Goggins and that journey is a priceless
journey that is hard for me to explain
to people because it sounds so quick and
easy that guy's lost this weight and I
went through three healthiest I went to
Ranger school went to Delta Force Lexus
whatever it is it was brutal it's a
brutal journey every [ __ ] day and if
ever less what are you happy
if anybody knows my life story and I try
to give you a just a snippet of it where
I'm at two days in front of Joe Rogan
telling you my life to get through what
I became to get to where I'm at now
there's nothing but pride I have for
myself that I can't really I can't
really show people because I have this
face and a space that they see like are
you happy what's wrong with you I'm
driven I'm obsessed and that's what you
see that's it people need to hear this
story
this is a this is an exciting story for
people because there's a lot of people
out there that feel trapped and they
feel stuck and they feel like they can't
do anything this is who they are you're
a guy who felt that exact same way but
figured out how to not be that person
and be a person
you would admire how did you what were
the first steps like you had some slips
before right because you you quit
because of the water thing right but
then when you went back the second time
and you decide you're going to lose all
that weight and you quit that job did
did you was it just straight forward
from there or whether there's some days
where you just failed and then you
picked it back up again so my first run
when I decided to lose the weight I was
like I said 297 I was about thirty two
percent body fat and I went my idea was
to run four miles for my first run I
didn't know how bad it's gonna [ __ ]
hurt me I used to run before I was fat
and I was like [ __ ] it I can do this I
ran a quarter mile and walked home I
walked home and sat on my couch and
cried I miss my mom's house who was
about 40 about maybe 20 minutes down the
road and cried and getting her couch
saying I can't [ __ ] do this I don't
know what I'm gonna do I just got
somebody pregnant my life was this
[ __ ] I was making $1,000 a month my
rent was 8/10 a month and my mind just
kept [ __ ] with me and kept [ __ ]
you're not good enough man this isn't
for you man these guys are best mother
[ __ ] on the planet Earth you not that
and what it was and it's kind of funny I
four
three two one boom and we're live
12 rules for life so without reading
this
so what you're saying is
there's only 12 things you need to know
in life right that's it yeah well
yeah this um this interview that you
just did
with this woman uh kathy newman was that
in the uk it was channel 4
uk um i just went i i felt bad but i was
also laughing i went to her twitter page
to read like and in with each one of her
tweets no matter what she says
someone writes underneath it so what
you're saying is and then some ridicul
but
by the way the your fans
were mocking her but politely
non-aggressively there were i didn't
read any rude
things like there was no there was there
was no insults or
there were well maybe a few insults but
there's no swears it was
just playful mocking of the interview
that she did with you because
the interview was ridiculous it was a
ridiculous interview and i listened to
it
or watched it several times i was like
this is so strange
like her determination to turn it into a
conflict
to it's one of the issues that i have
with television shows
yeah because they have a very limited
amount of time and they're trying to
make things as salacious as possible
they want to have these
sound bites these click bait sound bites
and she just went into it incredibly
confrontational not trying to find your
actual perspective
but trying to force you to defend a non
non-realistic perspective yes well i was
the i was the hypothetical villain of
her imagination essentially
well what happened what was interesting
too the way it it
played itself out because i met her in
the green room beforehand you know she
was being made up and then they put a
little bit of powder on me and
we had a friendly kind of interchange
and then we went and sat in front of the
cameras and for a couple of minutes
you know before before the show got
rolling and we had a pretty pleasant
back and forth and then as soon as the
cameras went on she was a completely
different person
and i thought oh i see
what's going on yeah yeah well so so
that kind of alerted
me to well the fact that there was
something rotten in the state of denmark
let's say
yeah but you know this is also why
youtube is going to kill tv
because television by its nature all of
these narrow broadcast
technologies they re they rely on
forcing the story
right because it has to happen now it
has to happen in like often in five
minutes because
they only broadcast five minutes of that
interview
they did put the whole thing up on
youtube to their credit
it it it hasn't ceased to amaze me yet
i think that they thought that the
interview went fine
that's the scuttlebutt i've got from
sort of behind the scenes because i've
you know i know some people who know
what's going on at channel four and
they're shell-shocked by the response
you know and and then of course there is
the counter response the guardian the
next day
published a paper or published an
article saying that
you know the head of channel 4 had to
call in police security because of
threats
you know well first of all you can call
the police in about anything
and they never did detail out exactly
what the threats were
you know but then about 20 newspapers
picked that up and went for the
well kathy newman is now being harassed
by an army of online trolls for doing
nothing but doing her job
which well i and then there was a
backlash against that in the press
and so it's been a well
well someone took an audit of the the
actual
interchanges that yep between fans and
her and there was way more negative ones
coming your way
yes that were seriously negative yeah
that's right seriously negative
violent harassing just rude
there were way more yeah and no one
picked up on that at all it was all
the narrative was she's a victim even
though
she was highly aggressive on in this but
she's a funny victim it's not like she's
not successful yeah you know it's like
at some point you think you should have
to hand in your victim card
i think like when you go to an ivy
league university it's like right then
and there you go
yeah because you don't get to be
oppressor and oppressed at the same time
that's just too much well one of the
things that you pointed out was when you
were talking about
competition for very lucrative jobs and
you were saying
look what you've done like you you must
have had to work here
and she proudly was saying how how hard
she had to work
yeah to get there i'm like well yes of
course no one's going to hand this to
you
no this is why and this is why you were
saying you are opposed to
equality of outcome i can't imagine
anything we could possibly strive for in
our society that would make it into hell
faster than equality of outcome like the
historical
the historical evidence for the
pathology of that root is so strong
it's like you have to be
historically ignorant beyond belief or
malevolent or
resentful beyond comprehension in order
to think that that's a good idea
i argue for that i agree with you but i
think that even if you came into this
with no knowledge of history but a
complete understanding of human beings
you would say well that doesn't make any
sense and one of the best quotes that
i've ever read about it is that if you
have real true freedom
you're never going to have equality of
outcome because with real true freedom
you have the freedom to not engage
well look if you look at a guy like jeff
bezos for instance that amazon guy is
worth more money than anybody ever
right that guy works all day yeah i mean
he's a maniac oh he's
acquiring all these different companies
and and everything he's doing
is designed to succeed i mean he's just
well that's what gates just said
too in a recent interview and i know
some guys that are you know they're
in approximately the same universe as
those two and
they just work all the time that's all
the time and they don't just work they
work so
efficiently and so effectively and make
use of every second in ways you can't
even imagine unless you're in that sort
of position
so and you know doing that doesn't mean
that you will succeed but
not doing it certainly means that you
will fail well you s
well not doing it certainly means you
will never achieve that level of success
and that's what we're talking about
we're talking about a quality of outcome
i don't want that i don't want to be
that guy i don't want to work like that
i don't want to do what he's doing and i
should have the freedom to not do that
yeah as he should have the freedom to do
that if we're going to play this game
called capitalism which we're all
agreeing is probably at least in
as far as the models that we have right
now is the best one that we have if
we're all going to play this game
if someone decides to be the michael
jordan of capitalism you can't stop them
you can't say no no no you're playing
this game too well you're playing this
team too hard you're too obsessed with
this game
you're going to have that yeah you can
stop them you can try to stop people
from winning crookedly
which is what you should do and yes you
know there's a couple of things that are
really worth delving into with regards
to that too because
there's this sort of marxist notion that
all this inequality is generated as a
consequence
of capitalism and that's actually
technically false
because if you look at there's a there
seems to be something like a law of
nature that's
described by this statistical model
called the pareto distribution
and it basically suggests that in any
creative domain
there's going to be a small number of
people will will do almost all of the
output but it doesn't just apply to
human beings
it implies it applies to the heights of
trees in the amazon rainforest
it applies to the size of cities and it
applies to the mass of stars
which is something like the more you
have the more you get
it's something you can imagine how that
would work with a star as it gets bigger
and bigger and its gravitational mass
increases
it's going to attract more and more
matter and then as the city grows well
more and more people are excited to move
there because of all the opportunities
and so
some cities start to grow tremendously
and others and others don't
but this this this
uh phenomena where a small number of
people end up controlling a tremendous
proportion of the resource
is not only limited to money and it
doesn't only occur in capitalist
societies
it occurs everywhere it's like a natural
law so you see the same thing with
number of
points scored by a you know a
spectacular sports figure
there's always a tiny proportion of
people who are way way
the head way ahead on the curve or
people who make records or people who
sell paintings or people who compose
music
or people who sell music online it's all
the same it's
it's the one percent gets 80 percent and
so
well first we can't blame that on
capitalism and second we should note
that it actually does constitute a
problem which is what the left-wingers
are always jumping up and down about
right like too much inequality
starts to destabilize your society and
it isn't obvious how to shovel
money from the top end maybe the one
tenth of one percent who have almost all
the money
down to the people who have almost
nothing in a way that's effective
so that they don't get thrown out of the
game completely and so that the whole
society doesn't
destabilize we don't exactly know how to
do that it is a problem because
inequality does exist and it does tend
to magnify across time
and then there's another problem too
which we haven't figured out is
imagine that in order to make everyone
rich
you have to tolerate a certain amount of
inequality that seems obvious
we don't know how many units of
inequality you need to tolerate per unit
of wealth generated
but the answer is definitely not zero
it's definitely not zero
so yeah so it goes back to this equality
of outcome yeah
yeah and this this thing has
perplexed me since i've met you and
since
uh you were involved in this original
debate over gender pronouns
and there was an article that was
written recently i forget the exact
title of it
i think it was something along the lines
of why can't people hear what jordan
peterson is saying
yeah you are misrepresented more than
anyone i know
in a weird way you are villainized in a
weird way
where um i can't believe that these
people are honestly
looking at your opinions and coming up
with these conclusions
i i can't help but feel like what is
happening
is people are consciously deciding
to ignore reality and paint you as this
archetypal figure of oppressive white
male
patriarchy ignorance
fill in the blank with all the the rest
of the descriptives that you'd like to
use but
they've decided to paint you in this way
like
as as a target because
they need a target to sort of reinforce
this idea
that transgender people are being
victimized and women are being
victimized and
well even deeper that the right
narrative is the way that we should view
the world is
victim versus oppressor because that's
the basic post-modern neo-marxist
template it's the right way to view the
world is that
it's a power it's a power ground it's a
what it's a
it's a battleground of power interests
competing constantly
the ones that win are oppressors the
ones that lose are oppressed that's the
way you look at the world
and i think that that's wrong that's a
bad way of looking at the world
psychologically sociologically
politically economically ideologically
you name it now it ends in nothing but
catastrophe
i mean first of all because it puts your
group identity as something that's
paramount
and i mean that's just not well that for
that isn't what we do in the west
let's say we put your individual
identity paramount
and then well that's just that's just
for starters fundamentally and then i
guess the other reason that people are
on my case to some degree is because i
have made a strong case
which i think is fully documented by the
scientific literature that there are
intrinsic differences say between men
and women and i think the evidence in
that
this is the thing that staggered me is
that no
serious scientists have debated that for
like four decades
it's that argument was done by the time
i went to graduate school everyone knew
that
human beings were not a blank slate that
biological forces
not parameterized the way that we
thought and and felt and acted and
and and valued everyone knew that the
fact that this has become somehow
debatable again is just
especially because it's being done by
legislative fiat they're forcing it
to me as a scientist it's just it's just
well and in the states too
with tight with title ix for example
because title ix is sort of predicated
on that viewpoint
what is title now oh title ix was
originally just a piece of legislation
that
um mandated that female sports teams
were funded to the same degree that male
sports teams were funded
in american universities but it's been
expanded out so that if there's any
differences
in any areas whatsoever between the
genders then the universities are being
taken to court
and like 200 i mean last i looked about
200 of them were up
and and they can have their funding
revoked if they violate the title ix
provisions
so it's become like a vicious weapon for
social justice warrior
equality of outcome types so it's not
just about
sports no it's got way way beyond that
yeah it's it's it's become an equality
of outcome
issue fundamentally there was an article
that i sent you
um one of them was uh from i think uh
like i thought i got it off of digg.com
but it was um
jordan peterson is having his moment and
we should ignore him and i send this to
you and there was one
probably the last part of that might be
true
[Laughter]
but one of the things in the article was
citing this study that showed very
little difference
oh god it's a pathetic study yeah well i
said it to you because i was like this
this is not right well the thing is like
most things
it's complicated yes you know so are men
and women more
similar or more different well it
depends on how you define the terms
first but they're more similar well why
well they're the same species
so we could start with that like but
the question is what are the differences
and how do they manifest themselves and
are those manifestations important so
here's an example if you took
a random woman out of the population and
a random man and you had to bet on who
was more temperamentally aggressive
if you bet on the man you'd be right 60
percent of the time
but you'd be wrong 40 of the time and
that that's not a walloping difference
right 60 40. it's not 90
10 like so there's quite there's a lot
of overlap between men and women in
terms of their levels of aggression
and you think well they're more the same
yeah
except so then let's say no no let's
play a slightly different game
let's pick the in a hundred most
aggressive person
from the random population well they're
all men
and that's why all the people in prison
are men so even though
on average men and women most well yeah
it's 90
90 90 to 95 right so and often if the
women are in prison it's because they
got tangled up with a really bad guy
you know so so one of the problems is is
that
differences at the extreme are where the
differences really start to manifest
themselves
and so you can have a small difference
at the level of the average
but out at the extremes it starts to
make a massive difference
so let's say to be a google engineer
which is hard right
because you not only have to be an
engineer but you have to be a very good
engineer
say well you have to be interested in
things rather than people
that's that's a huge difference in
and we're live all right Paul first of
all welcome thank you for coming here
and you are probably one of the most
requested people from the internet that
I've ever had so I feel good about that
and I'm honored he the first guy ever to
wear a mushroom hat okay that's really a
hat made out of mushrooms yeah it's made
from this Amadou mushroom
it's called foam nice momentary oh so it
was on birch trees throughout the world
but this is an example of why I think
shamanistic aliy plants mushrooms become
significant there's a plurality of
benefits
so this mushrooms a fire starter
mushroom it allowed for the portability
of fire there's no doubt that we came
from Africa we migrated north we
discover something new called winter
oops this allowed for the portability of
fire you can hollow this mushroom out
put embers of a fire inside and carry
fire for days if your clan could not
rekindle fire in Europe in the
wintertime you would die so when you
this has actually made by some ladies in
Transylvania yeah and it's a hardwood
conk oh well but when you soak it in lye
water you know ashes and water it
delaminates into this fabric whoa let me
feel that it's very soft it's also
called German felt
it's extremely flammable so
revolutionize warfare because during the
Napoleonic Napoleonic times this is the
the Punk that ignited gunpowder
even the Chinese invented you know the
Chinese invented gunpowder the Europeans
and that had the rifle so this loud
Flint's bark guns to ignite the
gunpowder this feels amazing it is as
high get a piece can you get that's a
great question depending on the size of
the conch on beats trees are much bigger
than birch these trees just naturally
get larger so the larger the conch the
more fabric you can tear but this
mushroom is made of mycelium and
basically that fabric is a cellular
fabric called mycelium
and this is I have actually I have one
that caught on fire because I'm gonna be
smoking a joint near me and the and the
embers of the joint got on my hat they
just immediately go up no it burns
really slowly so it's a fuse it's a
fantastic for delayed explosions it's
because you can light this thing and
beekeepers for hundreds of years use
this for smoking the hives of bees
because it's it's just we could we could
light it now I mean the whole thing with
one flick of the BIC and this thing will
smoke entirely in about 10 minutes and
turn nothing to nothing into white ash
Wow your fire alarms may go off though
yeah and so with this thing this larger
piece they would hollow this out put an
ember in there what they have they'll
have to blow on the Ember as they hello
well you could blow on a little bit and
you cap it and then you can put it in
your pocket the famous Iceman that was
found in the border of EA and Austria he
had this tethered to his right side
which is a position of significance you
know things that you need like your
knife you know and things that you want
to make sure you have right handed you
this on the right side so there's a this
one example is we have a threat of
knowledge of use of mushrooms that goes
over millennia and most of those threads
have been frayed or broken and in the
chain of knowledge but this is one of
the threads that was not broken and it's
significant I think it's we were much
more dependent upon mushrooms and when
we were forced people than we are now
seemingly in the cities but this coming
full circle very quickly
well mushrooms are weird in that some of
them are incredibly edible and
nutritious and other ones
I'll kill you and sometimes they look
really similar to each other well this
is with the mystery of mushrooms and I
think it speaks to also Michael phobia
the fear of mushrooms done mmm our
Gordon Watson first coined that term but
but we think about it in your visual
landscape with animals you see them for
months years and plants so you have a
very already factored but mushrooms that
come up and disappear in four or five
days some of them can feed you some can
kill you some can heal you some can send
you on a spiritual journey so to have
something so powerful and yet so
ephemeral it's natural for humans to
avoid that which they don't understand
out of fear because they don't know the
difference well you know 23 primates
consume mushrooms humans being one of
them and so that speaks for a long and
sexual use of mushrooms going back you
know and our primate of evolutionary
tree for a very very long time what how
many species of mushrooms are there you
know that you asked me that question
five years ago I would have said 1.5
million and now we're up to about five
million just being is being estimated
well plant fungi outnumber plants five
to ten to one and I just you know I you
know I speak at Ted and I've gone to
these TED conferences but it's shocking
with the smartest brains in the world
not until just recently did they realize
what us mycologists have known for a
long time thirty percent of the soil
mass when you're walking on soil the
thirty percent of the biological carbon
is fungal and the biggest because whoa
whoa whoa say that again thirty percent
thirty percent of soil is fungal mass
living in dead of healthy soil so and
this is the biggest repository of carbon
in the world in the ground is related to
these fungal networks so there is about
8.3 to about 10 million species on the
planet about right now about half of
those or fungal species the outnumber
plants up to eight to one ten to one by
by some estimates really nice
interesting metric and one meter of a
tree root
for every meter of a tree root there's a
kilometer of mycelium now think of that
three feet versus 2200 feet so that that
the extensiveness of the mycelial
network in our landscapes is vast and
it's a you is I called Earth's natural
Internet this is a these are membranes
that are literally sensitive I think
they're sentient they respond to every
footprint that we take on this planet
and as you walk across landscapes you're
breaking wood and that makes new
nutrition available so the composition
of fungi to find that new new nutrition
is fierce and so first to the menu wins
so this is something that we are now
understanding how essential they are for
preserving biodiversity and for the
health of the ecosystems as well as our
own personal health so when you say you
think they're sentient to what degree I
mean and you're not talking about just
like psilocybin yes we're kind of
intellectually provincial and that we
are using language invented terms and
order to describe concepts that we're
trying to we're struggling with so the
let me describe it this way that we
separated from fungi 650 million years
ago maybe you did dude I know some
people that are probably still well
basically we we are descendants of fungi
yeah
we share more common interests with
fungi than we do with any other kingdom
and fungi are closer to animals and the
art of plants animals came from funshine
you and I are actually fungal bodies I'm
speaking to basically another fungal
body right now so Joe Rogan I mean
whether you know it or not you you're
basically a fungal mass and from a
cellular point of view under the
microscope a human cells animal cells
and fungal cells are very very similar
we exhale carbon dioxide we inhale
oxygen as do fungus as the fungus does
we separated from fungi basically we
chose about to encapsulate our nutrients
in a cellular soccer stomach digesting
our nutrients within the fungal systems
digest their nutrients externally they
exhale oxygen
inhale carbon dioxide and their network
like design allows them to respond to
catastrophe and what I mean by that is
that the my silicone networks they're so
dense in the soil and they have
literally hundreds of billions of tips
and as these tips are growing out they
tend to be poly nuclei at the tips and
it allows them to upregulate new enzymes
acid sequences etc so if there's a new
ecological challenge a new food source a
new toxin or something the these fungal
networks are so a great plasticity and
being able to code for new sequences
from their DNA so all you need is one of
those hundreds of billions of tips to
find a new enzyme to break down a toxin
or a new food source and what happens
then is that information then is
incorporated genetically into the my
silikal network and the micelle immense
surges because it has new food logically
and so when it surges name creates a new
was called a sector of mycelium we now
know there's evidence that that my
silikal network then that it benefits
from that tip exploration and discovery
so these are like massively resilient
adaptive organisms that have a network
based design not dissimilar from that of
our neural networks not dissimilar from
the computer internet and more and more
that I explore this the more I'm
convinced that we will find network
based organisms throughout the cosmos
problem probably fungal systems and
fungal systems ultimately give rise in
our case animals it's more likely we'll
find fungal animal relationships all all
throughout the universe do you think
that there's some unknown way that
animals are connected in some sort of a
similar way as well that if if animals
came from fungus and fungus has this
incredible way of communicating with
each other do you think that there's
something like that within the animal
kingdom that we haven't discovered well
that stimulates my thought into and
talking about the microbiome the
mycelium landscapes networks they don't
live by themselves they select a
microbiome of bacteria and other
organisms that rest upon the mantle
these fungal networks are the foundation
of the food web well similarly we have a
microbiome and it's really interesting
that the the many of the bacterial
diseases that in fact fungi also affect
us our best antibiotics against bacteria
come from fungi penicillin being the
obvious example but we have found now
doing such next-gen sequencing and this
has never been published before that the
mycelial mats growing in the very same
wood chips in our case that had been
fermented we had a thousand full
difference in the relative abundance of
genre of bacteria from the very same
wood chips to different mushroom species
planted on those wood chips and the
micro biomes of that were created and
selected for by the mycelium were vastly
different this really strongly supports
the concept is the hypothesis was
quickly becoming a theory I was
committing the difference in a minute
but this really supports the concept
that I've long believed in a spouse that
these mice in little networks are not
just happenstance
they are just you're creating the
habitats in the flora and then
ultimately the fauna that are resident
within the ecosystem to guarantee the
plurality in the biodiversity of the
ecosystem by creating the plants that
crea that grow up that feed the animals
the insects to create the debris fields
and that feed the mycelium for the
benefit of progeny of the mushrooms out
form thereafter so these are
deterministic organisms that are setting
the stage for ecological evolution and
you think that they're doing this in a
conscious manner well see again we're
victim of our consciousness trying to
define what is conscious and what is
smart and one of the best arguments I've
had my brother bill is a super genius is
far smarter than myself
and he was editing one of my books my
celly I'm running how mushrooms can help
save the world and and he goes Paul you
cannot say that mycelium is intelligent
and you can't say nature is intelligent
I go wait bill I respect you but you
didn't realize that hypocrisy of the
statement that you're giving me you're
telling me nature is not in
and yet you are born of nature using the
mind to conceive the concept that
challenge the idea that nature is not
intelligent when you are part of nature
I rest my case
yeah that's that's in defense so yeah so
we're you know we create language and
words to describe concepts so you feel
like your brother was sort of hampered
by these predetermined categories that
we like to put things into it though you
have a word use that word the word is
very clearly defined in our ID thank you
thank you yes you know we Lent languages
code hmm and we don't have we haven't
elaborated the code yet to elucidate the
concepts that we're trying to articulate
that does not mean just because you
can't prove it's true doesn't mean it
hasn't happened right so as our
vocabulary increases you know as our
lexicon of language increases it got
more robust then I think we can better
better describe tests and and prove that
these concepts are true but we you know
we're biologically provincial when we
think about how limited we are we're
truly new Neanderthals with nuclear
weapons I mean this is when you look at
the how how important natural ecosystems
are try to replicate them they're very
very difficult to replicate due to their
complexity so I think the more that we
study nature most all of us scientists
that subscribe to the adage that the
more we study this subject the more we
realized we didn't know and the hubris
of us thinking that these things cannot
occur did not occur will not occur it
really speaks to our provincial attitude
towards nature the idea that these
fungus fungi are creating their
environment and and almost they're the
architects of this environment they're
they're establishing the landscape for
all these different creatures and and
life-forms to live is unbelievably
fascinating that the idea that the and
also that they're connected right
they're connected in some sort of almost
like a neural network and there's um
what is that thing in the Pacific
Northwest the one fungus group that's it
essentially the largest living organism
on the face of the earth
yeah the largest organism in the world
so far discovered is a mycelial mat 2200
acres in size and that's equivalent to
about 665 football fields and that's one
animal is one my
a little man one my Suleiman is a honey
mushroom that kills trees it's an edible
mushroom but think of this
I mean think so for those listeners out
there if any soil biologist know this
well if you go out and get some nice
rich soil a gram of it and you analyze
it the typically is a million five
million
microbes per gram in that soil then the
mycelium is growing out we have five or
six skin layers that protect us from the
infection the mycelium only has one cell
wall on the other side cell wall or
hundreds of millions of microbes for
ground that are trying to consume it
many of which the mycelium is able to up
regulate and constant biomolecular
communication with this ecosystem be
able to prevent predators from consuming
it thus allowing it to achieve the
largest mass of any organism in the
world this is amazing to me because it
means that is constantly in in
communication with the ecosystem being
challenged accepting alliances so guilds
of micro biomes are being created
selected by the mycelium and these
guilds in communities that cooperate in
order to prevent pathogens parasites
even competing guilds from coming into
the landscape so the dominance of these
fungi are to ensure the ecosystems that
give lives their progeny the rule of
natural selection of life is
reproduction so everything steers
towards reproduction so from an
evolutionary biology point of view what
will that organism do to help survive so
it can reproduce and and reproduction
through creating guilds of communities
the microbiome using the mycelium
network as the structural foundation of
the food web seems to be the name of the
game here
so this honey mushroom is what its camp
and that lives in the Pacific Northwest
how is it killing these trees it's a
root parasite so it comes in and kills
the trees and I spend a lot of time in
the old-growth forests and a lot of
hiking I've always been one wondering
about meadows in the subalpine regions
there's all these subalpine forests and
then you come out and is giant meadows I
suspect that the this honey mushroom is
a meadow maker it climaxes these trees
it kills them
they then die and then they grow
physically but then it clears the canopy
for the grasses but it was a prophetic
music is growing on dead material so
first is a pair of media mushrooms -
mushrooms first as a parasite kills the
tree then I say saprophyte or sap probe
that's another word for it it's a
decomposer it it breaks down that
material but as it decomposes the wood
30% of wood becomes water so the
mycelium generates water as the water
lenses are being created the Goethe now
you have more sunlight grasses and
flourish and so I've suspected that
these mushrooms are actually meadow
makers allowing then the elk and the
deer and marmots and whatnot to exist in
those Crossland environments it's a way
of rebuilding the nitrogen a source in
the soil so I think these are over great
and huge the timescales we have to get
away from the concept of our lifespan or
even 100 200 years we need to think in
millennial terms you know over many many
millennia this is unbelievably
fascinating the idea that they're
they're sort of the architects of their
ecosystem there are the architects of
our existence this is something that
there's some really fantastic research
that's come out in the past two years
I'm I'm a science ambassador for the
Triple A estimates from the vastness
science so I am a little bit out there
but I'm really happy that I have so much
scientific support these days because a
lot of things I've been talking about
for 20 years are now about well rooted
and been proven one of the things that
that has been so fascinating to me and
I'm still wrapping my mind around this
but you know the universe has created
about 13.8 billion years ago from the
Big Bang the earth coalesce autostart us
about 4.5 billion there are the earliest
records of life we have is about 3.8
billion years ago single-celled
single-celled organisms but just
recently and Lava Beds in south africa
they found my psyllium infused to the
lava 2.4 billion years ago now we split
from fungi 650 million years ago and
then in Brazil
last year they found a fully intact
apparently a fossilized mushroom
published in nature which is a very
reputable scientific journal and that
one is 1.4 billion years old so the
oldest multicellular organism in the
fossil record today is this fungus and
lava in South Africa 2.4 billion years
ago a fully formed mushroom who had as
its form
grew was growing 1.4 billion years ago
we were we separated from Funday 650
million years ago mushrooms have had
their form longer than we've had our
form by more than a billion years here
Jamie just pulled it up on the screen
here so we could take a look at the one
I don't want to be a first adopter those
[ __ ] thing's gonna fall apart
boom joke do you guys n-word live oh
[ __ ] oh [ __ ] did you really go out and
buy one of those iPhones last night did
you order no red band called me and he
goes are you gonna get because I asked
him a few weeks ago everybody I want to
get the yacht you know I don't know
anything about computers so I call red
man he's my computer guy so I went to
get the iPad the big one the 99 and I
asked lady because my phone's [ __ ] up
already she's just wait for the 8th so I
called red van about a month ago he goes
wait and last night he called out of the
blue goes you gotta get online at
midnight and I did it like an [ __ ]
I just forgot my code I got through I
got through the second click second
course click boom order I ordered the
silver black Bam Bam Bam and then at the
end I get the [ __ ] cold for I iTunes
a novel I woke my wife up in the middle
of the [ __ ] I did she really did time to
get the [ __ ] I did
so are you [ __ ] crazy waking me up at
12:15 some stupid [ __ ] phone there's
gonna be lines around the block at those
Apple stores it's it's crazy
it's like those sneaker lines when you
see those people they're out to buy
sneakers for the supreme lines now
Supremes got a whole thing I mean kid
they wait in line for three or four days
now and over what almost weekly alright
I'll show you this [ __ ] you're probably
gonna freak out when I show you what
they're waiting please do it shovels
bricks with just the word supreme
written on it shovels and bricks
t-shirts are the main thing what is
supreme exactly it's a brand it's a
streetwear brand and people wait in line
for bricks I'll show you
that's [ __ ] kids today this is what
happens when kids don't go outside they
don't play
they don't play sports and they stay at
home they just play video games Nancy
Reagan's fault with it just say no these
kids smoke dope they see life for what
it is yo Sam I'm gonna wait in line for
an hour for a [ __ ] break look at that
supreme crowbar they sell a crowbar so
the crowbar we just have like the name
supreme on it okay who's using that no
one uses it it's like
that it's real you have to look into the
brand a little bit to understand it but
it's sort of part of the joke almost
there making parody of the craziness of
it all by just throwing their brand name
on stuff and people are buying into it
go back to the page so supremely we're
in top 10 non wearable supreme products
Jesus Christ they have fire
extinguishers yeah new trucks but some
of the clothes are cool diff nunchucks
it's just depend you gotta be really
into it and some people are really into
it like I said they wait in line for
days well I don't know we're making
money off of it cuz they can buy it for
40 or 50 bucks and flip it for 200 well
I don't understand like why is everybody
buying this limited limited quantity
business what's awesome but what is the
big deal about supreme I cut you have to
look into the history up there's some
YouTube videos you can look up
you sound like Eddie Bravo gotta look
into it it's really hard to explain and
I like can't even it'd take me a half an
hour to get into it I don't want to
hijack the show supreme right now so
well I just never I wasn't aware of this
I thought it was just like a t-shirt
it's where it started you so Josh Martin
wears him he spends a lot of money he's
a fool
well he wears those goddamn Yeezys that
you were to I don't spend much money on
I get in for retail then buy him
otherwise yeah Josh Martin is like into
every trendy thing everything that comes
out he's like way ahead of the curve
supreme Jesus Christ Joey I don't give a
[ __ ] I didn't know about this do you buy
a hammer
it's a supreme on it the fact they sell
nunchucks is hilarious supreme nunchucks
did we wait on line we were not for
anything like last night was watching
something the real story about the
Godfather and they showed when they
released the Godfather at New York and
there were lines yeah the movies yeah
I'm sure waited in line you'll see Star
Wars but not three [ __ ] days can't
doubt the night before not for a hammer
what did they camp out for back to him
they kept out for something really I
feel like the first I ever saw it was
iPhones when the first iPhones were out
I remember going to the mall and going
what in the [ __ ] am I seeing and there
was a giant lion outside the Apple store
and this was like when one of the first
iPhones
was coming out and I was like quiet
waiting for a phone you don't have a
phone already like this it's the only
way to get the phone I was it was all so
confusing but it was a thing where
people would wait in mine and then they
would look at each other and I remember
when I remember when they were waiting
in line for Harry Potter when Harry
Potter was coming out and people would
drive him by earlier yell and now
Dumbledore dies at the end
another they're yelling out all these
different spoilers all I typed in was
waiting in line for in Google and the
only things that come up are iPhone
supreme and iPhone 8 or gasps yeah
that's right the seventies with the flag
yeah
red green a yellow flag what was that
there was like in the mid 70s there was
a gas shortage so Green meant that you
got gas if you had an odd-numbered like
if your license plate under the nod
yellow was even and then red was were
shut down [ __ ] oh yeah that's you
remember that they had to fly in 73 to
75 maybe something like I don't know the
exact dates then they had a weird line
studio 54 had a huge line but you got
picked Studio 54 3 or 54 was on fire you
showed up and you didn't guarantee to
get in you got picked right the way they
do now in Hollywood like they pick hot
chicks right so they pick hot chicks
what was the thing we're talking about
one night they won't let a guy in
without a check something yes I'm for me
going to go out in clubs and yeah they
never would let guys in without chicks
so if you walk into a club with three
guys they don't want you they want the
chicks in there first
yeah well the glass thing one is a
sausagefest look at all those dudes try
to get in look at Stewart look at this
that was inside but outside the deal are
the people well that could be it no
that's outside that sound what a zoo I
just try to get in just to try to get it
what was the big deal about studio 54

the beauty of it they have a station but
serious and it's called Studio 54 you
can just put it on on Sunday nights they
do a podcast and what they do is they
interview people that actually used to
go there or work there and I never tell

trust funders you know that's all the
people who could do that type of [ __ ] do
blow till all hours of the night you
could put it out they even had an
interview about when Bob home went to
studio 54 five hope I hope walk through
the studio that know what the [ __ ] he

went out to the middle of the floor and
started dancing and these chicks got
together started tying Bob Hope up just

was a holla bill and that's how I got
saved that's how I got home wow that was
it that's my studio 54 story it is weird
those clothes the nightclub scene the
nightclub scenes a very strange scene
now one club gets hot and then it dies
off and the people that are in that
business like try to figure out what
makes something hot and what doesn't you
got to rename places and redo them and
reopening and grand reopening and get
people to show up like I remember
hearing that they were paying Paris
Hilton like [ __ ] piles of money to just
show up a club that's it
the Kardashians and any of those people
they pay a shitload of money you're
there they take pictures and the club
gets hot now after buddies start taking
partners it yeah
shut because you know what's on the way
down I'm so against you so after a year
some guy comes and I love your place oh
yeah I'll take care of ya and that's how
you get out of it or you do a lot of
people didn't they just like the place
on fire stuff and scratch a little
Jewish lightning the play starts to
scratch you know I knew the guy that
owned the gay clubs in Houston like in
the 70s and he was telling me one time
he was you know once we got our you side
of him you let him on fire like the
insurance and then open up another club

it's a weird scene you know I mean
people that just look forward to just
going out and just drinking and dancing
and snorting coke every night just
looking for like experience just
something different and wild it takes
him out of their everyday grind just do
it over and over and over and over
