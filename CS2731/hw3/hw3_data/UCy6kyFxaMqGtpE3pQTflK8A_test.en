When talking about moving America's Israel embassy to Jerusalem, Bill "surprisingly" agreed with Donald Trump (he's always been pro-zionist, so it's not that surprising). 

Michelle Goldberg then went on to not only disagree with him, but get Bill's own audience to turn on him. And she was completely right.

Bill seemed to be in a bad mood all night, but this was particularly delightful.Without fail, those are more interesting, more serious, richer conversations. I used to watch Real Time from about 2006 until early 2017. Looking through the episode guide I believe the last episode I watched was Ep. 421 aired on April 7, 2017.

I remember the old Real Time where Bill would get interesting guests and talk about a myriad of issues. More importantly, he stuck to his roots as a comedian and the show was funny. Around the time after the election the show took a pretty unfunny and dark turn. Instead of new and interesting guests Bill hauled out recycled mouthpieces, the jokes were stale or just fell flat, and the 50+ minute show seemed to revolve entirely around Trump bashing.

Since that time that I stopped watching I'm wondering if Bill has returned to his old form? Looking up and down the guest list since that time I'm still seeing some of the same uninteresting hacks who always show up to spout the party lines and offer little to nothing new. There also looks like there's some genuinely interesting guests, but I'm afraid that the conversation would revolve entirely around "What did Trump do this week".

If someone can point out a good/great episode to get started back on, I'd like to watch it. I really loved this show but it became mind numbing in 2017 and a chore to watch. I'm really hoping he just goes nuts and says all sorts of crazy shit about staffers like "rancid penis" (reince priebus) or something equally crazy and delightful.**Tonight's guests are:**

Hell he brings Ann Coulter on a few times a year. However there seems to have been an uptick with the likes of Milo, Tomi, and "the Mooch". 

Curious is anyone has a guest that if they were invited, you would be out? Maybe not forever but you would definitely be out for a while.On multiple occasions last Friday Night, Scaramocci just straight up lies to peoples faces.  I don't understand how it could have gotten this bad, that Republicans just straight up lie to people.  Sure, Democrats spin the fuck out of everything, but they don't go to the "bald-faced lie" category very often, if it all.  For Republicans, it seems bald-faced lies are the bulk of their claims and beliefs.  

For example, he claimed that Donald Trump was presiding over a booming economy.  But its the same exact numbers that, under Obama, they insisted were cooked, and that the real unemployment rate was 42%.  All that changed overnight from Trump tax cuts, which don't even take effect until 2019, when you pay for 2018's taxes.  And they say this with a total dearth of self-awareness, as if they had only come into existence as humans on November 9th, 2016, as if their prior selves and what they said never existed.

There are so many examples of this, and they have totally saturated almost every claim in a Gish Gallup, just lies on top of lies on top of lies.  Its so impossible to sort through all the lies, that news anchors just literally give up and let them continue.  

How do you have a conservation, let alone a debate, with people who either lie to your face, or are so reckless in their regard for the truth that they'll lie without even knowing it?**Tonight's guests are:**

Am what just glib and can’t see her value or is Bill just obsessed with people no one gives a fuck about?  I feel like she’s on every 6th show and she adds NOTHING.  Cool, she works for vanity fair.  And?I think Jordan and Bill have similar values with different out looks...Was just watching the show and he stated that the Florida gunman had a MAGA hat on.

For the sake of argument, lets define left as left of Bernie Sanders.On the one hand, the audience wastes a lot time screaming "we love you Bill!" at the beginning of every show. I've also noticed they applaud any sound bite that falls into one of the following categories: (1) liberal guest says something liberal, (2) conservative guest says something liberal, (3) African American guest says pretty much anything, or (4) Bill inserts a joke. Sometimes it even cuts short a discussion when a counterpoint can't be made because the audience is too busy applauding over the guest (and then it's time for New Rules!).

But I also get that it's a live comedy show and there's an element of satisfaction that comes with laughter from a good punchline. Personally, I think the live audience makes the show better despite all the annoyances I mentioned above. I also think the audience is evolving in the age of Trump, adopting slightly more moderate views on issues like political correctness.**Tonight's guests are:**

How do we have a conversation with people who embrace lying as part of their very being?I can’t recall around what point in 2016, but it was definitely before the election, and after Trump got the Republican nomination.

This guest said that Trump’s name calling and low-tactics of lying and such (that he is still doing today) could actually help him win. What this particular guest was talking about was the psychological effects of Trump’s tactics. Said he either engaged in, or studied, these tactics himself (can’t quite remember the name he used to describe them) and that he thought Trump would win because these tactics have proven really effective when used by others.

*The blog suggests that there will be Overtime this week, but given their guest list shenanigans, I wouldn't bet on it.*As some of you might have noticed over the past week (and previous weeks), we (the moderators) have removed several comments in various threads.

Each of these were comments where the comment has been either been significantly aimed at a specific user, or for being part of the chain of comments that followed the original offending comment. 

Some examples include: 

&gt;Shapiro was the #1 target of the Alt-Right in 2016, you moron.

____________

&gt;Fuck face. Not when hillary clinton and barack obama exist.

__________

&gt;Which I why I asked the question, faggot. How does he know this, when did he say that , etc. Calm the fuck down.

__________

&gt;A) Go fuck yourself I'm not uneducated you fucking twat.
B) It's basic psychology so no I'm not going to waste my time finding literature on common sense psychology to an inbred fuck on reddit.

_________________
____________

Unfortunately, albeit unsurprisingly due to our growing userbase, each of the above listed examples (among others) came from a different user. Most warranted a simple removal of said comment with a posted warning, while one or two ended with a temporary or permanent ban.

This isn't what we want to do as moderators. In fact, we specifically created this subreddit to avoid the censorship and dictatorial nature of the moderator at our previous haunt. We want lively conversations, debates and even arguments. Hell, that's what Real Time is all about!

As such, we really only have one rule here regarding comments: **Don't be dicks to each other.**

Or more eloquently stated: **Please keep your comments, responses and statements confined to the discussion at hand, rather than specific groups or specific users.**

__________

*As in any subreddit, this rule is open to moderator interpretation, but you can always appeal a removal through the modmail (in the sidebar).*

__________

Additionally, we'd also like to encourage all users to use the 'report' button for any post or comment that they're even unsure about. Lately every removal or reminder has resulted mostly due to moderators (myself, to be honest) getting bored and trolling through old threads at work. But when someone reports it, it immediately comes to our attention.

_____________

And that's about it. So let's have it. What are your thoughts about our rule, or how it's implemented? Post whatever you want here as a response, and it won't be removed as long as doesn't break site-wide or NSFW rules (porn, basically).Something about "people get what I'm saying" so I don't have to correct myself or be sorry for a typo on a messenger app.**Tonight's guests are:**

What is a collection plate and what did he mean by that? Did Malcolm Nance actually imply that turnout in 2016 was 50 percent cause of Russia meddling? I mean, does he have brain cells?For a someone who’s been in comedy for so long, Maher is horrible at recovering from a bad joke. 

Now, I love his show and, for the most part, agree with his politics - but it absolutely makes me CRINGE when he scolds the audience for not laughing at a joke. It’s like he needs you to react the way he wants you to or he gets pissed.

I’ve been in the entertainment business and I can only imagine how his producers have probably tried to tell him this. 

Bill, if you’re reading this: STOP IT. If a joke bombs or gets a bad reaction, do what other comedians do: move on to the next joke.  Sometimes you have a certain “flow” and when you stop to make a comment like “these people are easily offended” or “I hate liberals” it’s very distracting and highlights your insecurities. 

I know you won’t read this, but it’s therapeutic for me to express myself.

Hey All--I breezed right through a post by Bill--not sure which profile--on facebook where he--or one of h is minions--asked people to post memes about Trumpest, can someone help me locate it? thanks.Last night while talking to Billy Crystal, Maher brought up age shaming as the last group of people you can shit on in America, putting ageism in the same category of slut shaming and fat shaming.
His point was that if someone over a certain age makes a misstep, their individuality is taken away and his or her age becomes what defines them and their mistakes. 
Is Bill vaguely referring to his own controversies about using the N-word with Ben Sasse? I remember the criticism directed toward Maher being centered around him saying that remark as a TV personality and a comedian, not him as a baby boomer or a man over 50.
I can see Mahers point about a lack of sexagenarian panels on TV (although I can't think of a time when this wasn't a factor) but I can't reconcile this with his argument of older people's age being the sole point of criticism when they make a misstep. Bringing up Woody Allen and Clint Eastwood was also a non-sequitur.
Bernie Sanders is arguably the most popular political figure in America. The world is going crazy for Larry David's return to Curb, and Mahers own show is at the peak of its popularity and influence in its 17th season. I don't see a lack of respect for older generations, all I see is Maher complaining about aging in an industry that has (for the better part of a century) always favored the young.   
 Just wanna say I really did like Brand's appearance on the show. Unlike a lot of people who go for his act, he doesn't overblow his ecstatic personality and hit the right balance.

He was funny, witty and smart (was great when he accurately recalled the gerrymandering definition). I didn't know him before this show at all but he really did a great job last night.Yeah Bill, maybe installing sensors in vehicles to remind parents that they left their kids in the car will only prevent "one" or "a few" tragedies (even though it seems to happen almost weekly, which you seemed to ignore), so we shouldn't require vehicle manufacturers to install them. We should just tell every parent to "look around".

But can't you directly apply that logic to seat belts and airbags? "You should have the personal responsibility to never get into a car crash, so why should I have to pay extra for airbags and seat belts and crumple zones?"

What the fuck Bill? You honestly do sound like a whiny little bitch these days. Maybe you should go browse /r/Libertarian for a while and see what your fellow brethren believe and realize how retarded your whole philosophy is.Howdy folks. Back in 2008 I was a super senior at UCLA playing bar trivia when someone asked if I wanted to be on a student panel about politics on RTwBM (Trump’s fav combo) the next day. I said sure and spent the night reading Wikipedia. 

I was so far out of my league! They’d gotten members of the Dem/GOP clubs plus two random schlubs, one of whom was me. Our venue was a glamorous brown cafeteria on the (CBS?) lot. There were about 10 students sitting around a large table. Mostly we talked about Hillary/Obama and the ongoing primaries — plus whatever arcane political trivia my peers were showing off with.

It was a long time ago and I was hungover, but I’ve never seen the segment. I’m not sure it even aired! But you get older, you want these things, and there’s one clip in particular I’m after. 

Bill said something like: “Well, what’s gonna get these kids to vote?”

And I said, “Facebook will tell us to”. 

Would love to find that clip (I think it shows how long FB’s potential influence on elections has been obvious). 

Like I said: not even sure the panel made it to air, or if that soundbite was included. But that’s what I’m after. It would have been early 2008, so Season 6 on the show.

Any ideas on where to look or who to ask?

Thanks!Rewatching the latest "Real Time" which was two weeks ago. Russell sounded more sane than Bill, to the point where Bill had to "joke" his way out of the situation. Bill donated $1 million to Hillary's campaign and he can't stand she lost anyway.**Tonight's guests are:**

Basically Johnny Canuck takes the gun safety course(8 hours) to buy a long gun (or 'restricted' gun course, another 8 hours for handguns) and he passes a couple tests and fills out the paperwork that let's him buy a gun. In that paperwork he has to list if he's had a common law partner, and they need to sign the form or it is considered incomplete and he will be turned down.  
If he had a common law partner in the last two years that he is no longer living with, they need to sign the form.

One week he's saying Democrats should be more like "bad boy" Anthony Weiner, then he's saying that Republicans vote for their sex offenders unlike Democrats who put theirs in jail?

Then he's saying Democrats should be tougher and stop apologizing for doing un-PC things, then Bill apologizes profusely for saying a joke with the N-word in it.

This show is like watching an old man slowly lose his mind.There's a video of Bill commenting on that Trump says shocking stuff and nobody bats an eye while politicians back in the day did it but got ridiculed.

It seemed like an awkward moment on the panel last night, but google doesn’t seem to confirm this is the case.

I normally don’t care about Hollywood relationship crap, but this just seemed odd to me...Seriously, this guy was as on point as any guest Bill ever had on. He outshone Max Brooks, for gods sake!Seems hypocritical that the outrage would come with graduate students but, the equivilent of a high school degree today being ransomed is fine. I'm a college student and I've seen my tuition get raised 3-4 times in the years I've been going to Penn State University. Wheres the outrage on that?

The response by baby boomers to me is: "Life is unfair".

My parents payed like 1/5 of what I pay a semester when they went to University in Pennsylvania in the 1980's.Honestly, RealTime and John Oliver are my Trump pressure release valves. And these guys are missing vast amounts of comedy gold.  The button? C’mon! You guys need to hurry back.He is either 

1. A total liar and bi partisan hack that will always defend party over country

2. totally fucking delusional

I just hate him on AC 360. He will never see logic and constantly defends delusion and it's totally pointless having someone like that on his panel.I suppose you could say I’m more libertarian than anything else. And Bill Maher’s comedy and show definitely spins to the left a little more as he attacks republicans significantly more than democrats. However, I really appreciate how he attacks some of the insanity on the left, the radical feminists and SJWs, pc police, things like that. That’s something I don’t see a lot of other liberal comedians doing and I really appreciate that he can see the crazy on his side too, it adds a lot of credibility to his show. Either way I still appreciate the jokes he makes against both sides regardless of how much I agree with the sentiment (don’t get me wrong I see the crazy on the right as well). Even this past week's been insane. But Roy Moore, Michael Flynn, Fusion GPS, North Korea, Steve Bannon...the list goes on &amp; on.[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On6mkkIHqlk)

Holy shit there's an episode I won't be missing.He interrupted each guest at *least* once last night. I literally shouted “shut the fuck up” at my TV when he continuously interrupted Zooey. What’s the point in inviting guests if you’re going to keep interrupting and cracking corny jokes? It just makes it awkward. 

I enjoy watching Bill, but man last nights episode was hard to sit through. Jordan Peterson is one of the most important intellectuals in the West today. I’d love for Bill to start off the show with a 17 minute segment discussing men’s role in today’s society.Surprisingly, this issue doesn't seem to have received any traction in this forum. everybody seems to be focused on Zooey's interview, and Israel moving their embassy.

What do people think about the interview?

How does the community self-police their use of smartphones, and social media? What choices have you made for your family? Or, what decisions have you encouraged them to take?

Has anyone recognized the personal ill effects of social media, and quit their use as a result?He just seemed a little...off. Stumbling over words in the monologue, more uninhibited about interrupting his guests, not really completing his thoughts when he spoke. Was he on something? Did he smoke a blunt with Zooey before the show?My understanding was that guests are paid a nominal fee to come on the show &amp; I imagine some of the more choice opening interviews (Looking at you, Michael Wolff) can accrue a fairly respectable amount.

Maher:  That's not fair, we have to at least wait for the report to come out before we decide.


Maher every week:  TRUMP COLLUDED WITH RUSSIA!

So when someone says "no collusion" the answer is "wait for the report", but when someone says "there is collusion" the answer is "Yes even though the report isn't out yet".I’ve been a bit disappointed in his one on one interviews lately; but I felt like he really got back into his own with Geraldo, he kept pushing, he actually challenged the guy and he didn’t couch every question in a joke that took longer than the questions.

This felt like a return to form Such a shame Maher has suffered Trump Derangement so badly.

I believe it's a catch 22 for him after defending both Kathy Griffin and Laura Ingraham.

Allman got pressured and resigned. I wonder what will Bill's position on this situation be? What about free speech now? And oh... all the mighty sponsors.

I usually watch it throughout the week.  Staying in tonight and drinking. Was looking forward to watching it and assumed it would be posted on HBO NOW when it aired just like the other HBO shit I watch.

Oh well haha.Sometimes I think Bill is slightly inexperienced on how the younger people are doing, whether they're growing up thinking that they're owed everything while being completely unaware of what's going on in the world or where the real priorities lie. He finds the stories about the overly PC university kid who got adults to listen to him and now we've all been taught to be entitled to the extent that children are all now becoming these entitled ingrates who insult their parents like in the movies? He  says he never interacts with children in the same sentence where he claims that they're just like the kids in the movies? He acts like they're a different species in a different world. Kids don't ask for the participation trophies and they certainly don't walk around with an attitude because they have social services under their belt. Do you think that kids stay quiet about abuse and other confusing acts that adults commit because they think they deserve it all? They're simple, boring, dumb kids. The ones who think this way still have time to grow, and I really wish he could go see how well the rest are doing. I'm ending the rant with my favorite excerpt from East of Eden.

“When a child first catches adults out -- when it first walks into his grave little head that adults do not always have divine intelligence, that their judgments are not always wise, their thinking true, their sentences just -- his world falls into panic desolation. The gods are fallen and all safety gone. And there is one sure thing about the fall of gods: they do not fall a little; they crash and shatter or sink deeply into green muck. It is a tedious job to build them up again; they never quite shine. And the child's world is never quite whole again. It is an aching kind of growing.”

Is anyone else confused about Bill's choice of topics to discuss this week? I'm mainly confused about the attention given to the Starbucks arrests and the ignoring of developments with the Korean peninsula. Perhaps I just don't know enough about the incident at the Philly Starbucks but it seemed odd to me that that story gained so much traction especially over headway towards the Trump-Kim meeting and North Korean moves to stop missile launches and creating nuclear material.

Follow @RealTimers on Instagram or Twitter (links in the sidebar) and submit your questions for Overtime by using **#RTOvertime** in your tweet.What did he mean when he called Brett Kavanaugh "Justice Red Solo Cup"?During his New Rules segment he was talking about politicians going out to eat and people protesting them. He mentioned Ted Cruz and said the protesters were chanting "We believe survivors!". Bill Maher joked that it must have been at a Chipotle. Was he joking that people weren't there protesting Ted Cruz but protesting Chipotle by chanting "We believe survivors!"? Meaning they believe survivors who have survived eating at Chipotle? This guy seem right up Bill's alley - can we get him on as a guest?  


[Here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2018/07/10/democrats-must-consider-court-packing-when-they-regain-power-its-the-only-way-to-save-democracy/?utm_term=.287e7f8576b0) and [here](https://www.vox.com/2018/5/1/17258866/democratic-party-republicans-trump-election) you can read about his suggestions. They include among others:

* court-packing (increasing the number of seats on the supreme courts and appointing liberal judges)
* statehood for Puerto Rico and D.C. (adds four likely Democratic senators)
* splitting up California into at least three separate states (adds another four senators)
* increase the number of representatives in the house (lessens the impact of gerrymandering) - the ratio of population to representatives is one of the highest in the US compared to other democracies

The Republicans have had two presidents who didn't win the public vote and then appoint Supreme Court justices - on top they stole the Merrick Garland seat. They have long-standing plans to transform the constitution which has been [discussed previously on Real Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMHPH96Z3ic).

Really nice to see some clips from the old ABC Politically Incorrect show, and they did an excellent job at showing not only the evolution of Bill from a young guy on Carson to an absolutely unique voice for political humor, but also the evolution of the format of the show that plays so well to Bill's strengths. 

Bill is so unique that he can't be replaced, and this special showed why. Really well done.

Absolutely pathetic and weak. Stormy had nothing interesting to say and hasn't for months. Scaramucci has NEVER had anything worth hearing. Who is Maher pandering to with guests like this? Hey, Bob Oschack! You and I used to pal around together at the Comedy Store back in the day. Do what you can as a senior writer for the show to influence Bill and get him to start booking guests of substance again.In the opening interview with Bill, when talking about sex with Donald Trump, she says 'I got the first package and sadly mine went off'.

What does she mean by this?"(Max is making a point)... I tried to make the point in the White House (which is probably why only lasted 11 days), there was no reason to have a war with the media, the first thing I did in the White House was turn the lights and cameras back on because I believe in the First Amendment and you have to hold people in power accountable."

If that doesn't tell you everything you need to know about this administration I don't know how else to describe it. 
A new press secretary showed up and said, "Don't fight CNN, were going to let people see what we do here because of the constitution" and that man holds the record for fastest guy shown the door.Episode didn't have much to offer anyway and Maher just seemed like a stuck tape recorder.

Mooch was saying something seemingly sensible on the lines that president makes things personal and that's why it has more impact and that every time Maher or MSNBC has an outrage it just energises their base.

What's the point of having one voice of dissent if you are not gonna let.hom complete a sentenceHe’s no wrong.  People don’t want the product of bulldozer parents being in charge of anything.  And by giving them a platform, it gives the right a target against snowflakes. Idk why, I just enjoy Maher more when he was making fun of conservatives/Republicans for freaking out over everything Obama did...

But now when Republicans are actually in power and the Left is the one constantly outraged, it doesn’t seem as good...

Does anyone else feel that way at all?Question. Is the Bill Maher Real Time anniversary available On Demand at HBO?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On6mkkIHqlkI'm just wondering if there was an episode and it got taken down for some reason**Tonight's guests are:**

- **David Hogg &amp; Cameron Kasky:** are students at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, and Co-Founders of the student advocacy group on gun control Never Again MSD.

Holder is a Partner at Covington &amp; Burling LLP. 

- **John Meacham:** is an NBC Contributor and Pulitzer Prize-winning author whose forthcoming book is titled "The Soul of America: The Battle for Our Angels."

- **Amy Chua:** is a Yale Law professor and tiger mother of two daughters. Her latest book is "Political Tribes: Group Instinct and the Fate of Nations".

It's like it puts too much pressure on them for the discussion. With 3 it flows more naturally. It's too calm with 2.

Anyone else have a preference?-The Wall.  Bill calls the wall racist, but he is a 100% defender of Israel and has never called for their wall to come down, nor did he complain during its construction.

-Israel.  Bill has already said he agrees with Trumps decision to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem.

-Fake News.  Just this past show he was talking about how most news is in fact "fake news".

-Islam and terrorism.  Bill's tough on Islam and so is Trump.  Bill rips on liberals for being weak on Islam all the time.

-Being PC.  Bill rips on liberals for being too PC all the time, but he flat out says that people like Trump because he's not PC.It started in 2016 with Xiuhtezcatl Martinez, whose apparent celebrity derives from being a 17 year-old who is able to construct a coherent English sentence in front of a live camera.

Then with the two kids raging against baby boomers last week... sigh. They were clearly so pleased with themselves for appearing on TV as self-proclaimed experts that they forgot they have zero credentials in public policy or any grasp of navigating the complex political realities in which we operate.

No one should endure the horror of their classmates, but I loathe the fact that they are being used as unwitting props in the larger political theater. It's fine to recount these events as witnesses... on Dateline NBC. But let's not hijack Bill's show to hatefuck an entire generation because the world is, and always has been, a shitty place to live.

The question is what to do about it, and teens riddled with angst and hormones don't have any productive answers.

Am I missing something? Was this a one off, or is overtime no more?It feels like people are either brigading from T_D (presumably to “redpill” us) or they are still Bernie Bros. Bernie is obviously less extreme but those guys are weirdly condescending and angry about how nobody understands how great socialism is. 

I know it’s the internet, so people are naturally more confrontational, but every time I come to this sub I get overwhelmed by negativity. It’s getting so toxic that people now only complain about Maher and downvote praise for the show. 

Honestly his show isn’t as good as it was in 2016 but he is trying to adapt to this crazy time. It is still the best late night-style show out there by a mile. Yesterday I saw a comment being badly downvoted for saying Maher was on form that night! What the hell is that?! Can’t we get some enthusiasm going for literally the only thing that unites people on this subreddit? It’s becoming a cesspool.

The podcasts are great but I want to watch it with video, preferably at a high resolution. 

Are there any services out there which provide what I want?I swear he's flipping out more and more at the audience each episode. They're not booing you dude, it's just a natural reaction to groan *before* laughing at the image of a dude being turned into cheese."Thoughts and prayers do nothing, legislation does everything"
(paraphrased).

"Funny how all these pro lifers are o.k. with kids being killed with assault weapons, they're only pro life until they're old enough to be shot at" (paraphrased).

I'm going to an anti gun protest next week and Bill Maher had me thinking about all the inconsistencies with conservative stances regarding so called "Pro Life ness". 

I'm also thinking about it because the protest is coming up this week. [Here is the link to that discussion with Maher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcsKMie6M94).Bill is 61 now and he probably won’t want to do the show forever. 

Should it end when he leaves or should some else step in like The Daily Show?

i love this show since starting in oct 2016. 


watching old vids isn't really that great because it's essentially about the news at the time. having said that, i've seen lots of old clips that are on youtube



is there any other show similar to this?I had a conversation at my university with a local and this is where my conversation went.

He argued that clip size and caliber make no difference but, a combination of factors make a different with how deadly a weapon is i.e. caliber + clip size + muzzle velocity.

So let me get this straight, if the person had 15, 30, or 100 round mags; it wouldn't matter which he used? they seem to think that the economics behind being able to buy these weapons wouldn't make a difference i.e. if they had to purchase 5-10 different clips/magazines instead of 1 drum round of an extended magazine. 

He also seemed to argue that the founders of the US were visionary geniuses that could've had the foresight of weapons more advanced than when they ratified the Constitution + the 2nd Amendment i.e. 1790. 

Like who is he kidding right? they had flint lock riffles at that point in time. it took 2 mins on avg to load 1 bullet. Not 1 minute to load 30-100 rounds.

He also seems to think that the 2nd Amendment is specific to individual gun ownership but, doesn't understand that literally in plain text: "A well regulated militia", the context for this time period was the second amendment was meant to be a deterrent for the British to not try to re-capture the original colonies, that's my understanding anyway.

[If anyone is curious, here's loading a flint lock riffle on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT47W-C4F8Q).

The most amazing part is how most of these regular people don't seem to understand that the ar-15 is a civilian version of the m4 that was developed during the Vietnam War to compete with the Ak-47 that was in use by communists in the many proxy wars the US was conducting around the world at the time.**Tonight's guests are:**

Otherwise I have tuned out all things Hollyweird.I am not an American. Thus I have no access to HBO Go, etc.

I want to find a full episode (specifically, 13.30 (#367, Oct 9, 2015); an absolutely amazing episode, perhaps the best ever, whose short clips on YouTube I savor like fine French cheese, nomnomnom).

Do you know how I could find the full video? I will gladly pay, but it would be necessary to get a file or a DVD or something. (I want to save the episode in my personal archives for generations to come.)

Follow @RealTimers on Instagram or Twitter (links in the sidebar) and submit your questions for Overtime by using **#RTOvertime** in your tweet.Anyone else find it odd that half of the show is released via YouTube prior to HBO Go or HBO Now posting the full episode? It's bizarre. As of this posting, nothing from the episode is on HBO Go/Now but the following clips have been on YouTube for over an hour:

[Monologue: Royally Screwed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHfxcts8dfI)

[New Rule: Trump Is Above the Law](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RYb72FPzzc)     

This honestly just makes me want to cancel HBO's SVOD service. What's the point in having it?I've heard the name but don't know his deal.  Will try to give his podcast a spin though.  I think he contributed well to this episode.  Bill was on point too; more lucid than usual.Last week and this week he said he doesn't think trump will leave the whitehouse even if he loses. He keeps saying the US democracy is dead and he's really pushed up the rhetoric about how "doomed" america is.

The thing is, when Bush was President Maher more or less did the same only then the problems that were going to "end america" were the war in the middle east and defaulting on debt....

Maher just seems to be ramping up the "we're doomed" rhetoric way too much for my taste and it's getting quite tiring watching him for me.First of all, this discussion pissed me off. The constant fallacies from Shapiro was vomit inducing but the thing that really gets me is the comment section. One of Shapiro's goons probably sent all these low IQ conservatives over to this video and this is almost as depressing as the fact that 40% of the population still supports Donald Trump. 

Here's the summary of what happened: 


**0-3:40**    Shapiro said he doesn't support Trump's character but agrees with some of his policies - tax cuts and judge nominations - and can't deny the hypocrisy of the Republican party Maher points out. 


**3:40**  Shapiro said he is willing to vote for a Democrat despite  "some" flaws of conservatives because they are "absolutely insane". His main complaint being one about civility: "... shouting down people at gas stations or kicking people out of restaurants". 

And this is where the shitstorm begins. This is what Maher gets pissed as Shapiro's double standard about civility is ridiculous. The guy who fired the investigator that was investigating him, threatening to lock up journalists, and poop tweeting at 3 am about people's appearances is somehow representing the more "civil" party. His response is "look it's elephant vs elephant. Can't you say civility is bad across the board?". Except (1) this is a false equivalency and (2) it doesn't explain why this is one of the main reasons you support conservatives over the democrats, seeing how this is an 'insane' left-wing flaw. 

**4:45**   Rambles about 600 officers needing to protect him, as if this has anything to do with party civility more than his own polarizing nature. 

**5:10**   "I agree with you". Okay then why did you start this bullshit line about Democrats needing to step up their civility game? Dipshit. 

**6:30**   Now we talk about children having a "voice" in the government. He uses the same description to disqualify children that would disqualify Trump. Shapiro's response is "look I don't see him as a thought leader" pretending as if the president hasn't/ can't enforce actual policy changes or have a voice in the government. This should illustrate to you what kind of fraud Shapiro is. 

**7:45**  What Bill Maher should have said was bringing up sanctions, which is the #1 advantage Trump has given Putin in policy. 

**8:40**  More logical fallacies incoming. Shapiro claims Donald Trump can't collude with his own left foot. Then he makes a nonsensical comparison between a "doofus and an evil genius, you can't be either". Doofus and genius are polar opposite words but you attached an adjective to one and not the other you dumb fuck. You absolutely can be an "evil doofus", a concept which is inconceivable in Shapiro's brain. We have Donald Trump Jr. saying "I love it" in response to damaging information on the Hilary Clinton campaign by a Russian. That's a retard in collusion.﻿

[Source.](https://twitter.com/RealTimers/status/1013452168093810693)So my wife and I drove up from Arlington last night (friday) to Winstar Casinos to see Bill. The show was hilarious as expected, but about halfway through somebody near the front of the stage either collapsed, fainted or possibly even died. We couldn't see what the hell was going on, but Bill had to stop the show for about 30 minutes. He handled it the right way, telling everybody to get back and calling for doctors in the house etc.. Very strange. Was anybody else there or have any information on what the emergency was ?**7/7 (tonight) at 10 ET on HBO (replays at 1 ET/10 Pacific)**or get married? Is Bill’s accent a typical Midwestern one? To my ears, he doesn’t have any weird inflections  and exaggerated intonation when speaking. 

I knew he grew up in New Jersey and I have known people who grew up there and they don’t sound that similar to Bill’s accent. Bill does a bit about the progression of lies the Trump Admin has gone through. It ends up with, yeah there’s collusion but not criminal, then yeah it’s criminal but I can commit crimes because I’m president. Obviously that’s pretty butchered. I just wanted to keep that quote in my pocket for talking to idiot republicans and I didn’t want to rewatch the whole special for just a small clip.Do not recall the date but may be just before 2012 election. In the end of the new rule bit he says " you know whats more frightening, 3 words- President Donald Trump'. The video was on youtube till december 2016 but have never seen after that. If anybody remembers the episode and can point out?Just wanted to share. I've never been before so I'm expecting it to be very interesting. **Tonight's guests are:**

I wanted to see the interaction between them. She didn't look happy at the end. I don't know if it was the rebuke or the content of New Rules. One of a few awkward moments in tonight's episode.

Carrey looked like he was trying to rein himself in, with varying degrees of success. His idea about ignoring Trump for a week was a good one. I want to check out his new show. Michel Gondry!

The "even Indians make money" comment might get some backlash. I think the Friday spot is intentional. Only the most controversial stuff has news legs through Monday.

Good show tonight. Funny.huge fan of both Maher and Goldberg but leaving aside the arguments for and against Franken, Bill was just rude to her last night with that condescending sneer as he admonished her. She was a guest on his show and his level of anger was uncalled for.  He should apologize.First time poster - so be kind with me. 

If i remember correctly, before the summer break Maher said he was going to have Ocasio-Cortez on his show. I’ve been looking online and I don’t see anything regarding her appearance - scheduled or cancelled.

~~*Editor's note: There were no guest bios posted this week, and I don't have time to research non-biased blurbs.*~~

***Fucking interns finally posted the bios and added Sec. Kerry to the guest list. Updated accordingly.***Bill came out optimistic that this week's events could be the last straw. Only the Manafort thing has potential, in my opinion. But I thought that about the Stormy Daniels thing too. 

Honestly, I think it's business as usual. Only a faltering economy could bring this guy down. But then, who knows? He may be able to convince his base that bad is good or, more likely, that the bad is because of someone else.Tells me I need to reactivate, then tells me an error has occurred, then tells me to check my internet connection in an endless loop.

I was really want to see Maher's take on Manafort pleading guilty.Every time she’s on the panel the show is boring.

#### New rule

If S.E. Cupp is scheduled to appear, cut her and do a 2 person panel.Content wise, it has way more diverse topics than what we see now and I just keep watching.

I get it. Trumps dumb and an easy target, and it genuinely is newsworthy every week, but I need a break. 

I miss the in depth conversations about the Middle East, the economy, national non-political news, intricate foreign policy decision, and genuine disagreement that feels legitimately two sided. I could walk away a skeptic and interested myself. It’s so easy and draining to watch the Trump train constantly, and every bit for the past 20 or so episodes has involved Trump in one way or another. 

I love Bill, but please, just one week, don’t say the T word. 

[Source.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz3e0HhwQAo) Unless an intern fucks up again. I have been watching Bill Maher since 1994 and disagree with him on some issues but I am generally a fan. I don't see this smug and condescending criticism as valid. Doesn't it make the left as intoleranct as they claim the right conservative people are, over whom they claim moral superiority?  What is this if he doesn't agree with 100% of what my opinion is then he is a piece of shit coming from? Aren't people allowed to be nuanced in their thinking?

Donna Brazille took over and was discovered to be leaking debate questions to Clinton before the debate, as was found in the leaked emails published by WikiLeaks. I know for a fact Bill Maher is aware of these hacked emails because on every show he rants about how Russia interfered in our election by hacking the DNC emails. But he conveniently leave out the part about how the emails prove Hillary and the DNC colluded to steal the damn election. Bill Maher thinks that "resisting Trump" means supporting corporate Dems, and he believes he is doing the right thing supporting Hillary because it is going towards defeating Trump in 2020, but he is missing the fact that there is an insurgency of populist left candidates I.e. Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez, Ro Khanna and Beto O'rourke. They are the ones energizing the blue wave, and Bill, by continuing to support establishment corporate Dems is doing nothing except proving himself to be an out of touch coastal elite.

Follow @RealTimers on Instagram or Twitter (links in the sidebar) and submit your questions for Overtime by using **#RTOvertime** in your tweet.So... who is the second RINO?Islam, which has hundreds of interpretations, is just as bad as Nazism. Because of a shitty or intentional misinterpretation of a thousand+ year old document.Copied from my posts in the original /r/pics [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/70stki/guy_in_downtown_seattle_wearing_a_swastika_arm/)^1 :

&gt; I would agree with you that Nazis symbols like that guy (the Nazi) is wearing do in some ways threaten violence, and are the symbol for the genocide of millions of people. But does that somehow undo the First Amendment? I would say, based on some recent Supreme Court cases, no -- at least not in the way the Nazi is doing it ...

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; You see, *Brandenburg v. Ohio* (1969) established that you need a "clear and present danger" to limit free speech. The court latter added in *Hess v. Indiana* (1973), that speech that "amounted to nothing more than advocacy of illegal action at some indefinite future time" is still protected and can't be limited. I would then argue that such Nazi symbols, ***taken alone,*** do only amount to the "advocacy of illegal action at some indefinite future time," and are thus protected.

People also brought up concepts like fighting words in that thread, and I believe they don't apply here:

&gt; *Fighting words* do exist, but I do not think they would qualify here. You see, I believe fighting words have to be somewhat of a personal character. So, if I was just yelling for genocide on the street, publicly, I would be fine. But, if I was calling for a genocide of all black people, to a black person, just to incite him, that would "fighting words." See [*Snyder v. Phelps*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snyder_v._Phelps) (2011).

1: Technically, Constitution-wise, the following cases concern the government's relationship with people, not an individual person's relationship with another person. However, a lot of regular people in America seem to think that it is also their duty to uphold the Constitution as freedom-loving Americans. And I would say to those people that, technically, it seems the Constitution would be against punching Nazis, despite their speech.&gt; You can only punch someone if they are an imminent threat.

&gt; &gt; Maybe they're not a threat to you personally. But if you were black and saw a man in a white hood, you'd be stupid not to consider them an imminent threat. And why does it need to be an imminent threat? I'm all for beating someone who threatens to get you in the future.

Here is my response to that from a legal point of view, copied from my posts in the original /r/pics [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/70stki/guy_in_downtown_seattle_wearing_a_swastika_arm/)^1 :

There's really nothing to challenge there in terms of accuracy.

As for the pee tape, obviously Trump did not hire hookers to pee on *him*. (Also obviously, the women's pictures and names in the bit were jokes.) But the Steele dossier, which has otherwise shown itself to be remarkably accurate in its individual points, suggests that Trump may have hired prostitutes to defile a bed in a room he knew Obama would be staying in on an upcoming visit. This is an outlandish claim, but I also believe it's well within Trump's M.O. to do something like this against a guy he *already* hated (and tried to suggest was a foreigner ineligible for the presidency, despite no evidence for his claim and a mountain of it against it) even before Obama roasted the hell out of him in public at the White House Correspondents Dinner.   I believe Trump became hell-bent on revenge, and I think having Russian hookers piss on a bed he knew Obama would sleep on was probably not even at the top of the list of things he wished he could do.

Again, I'm not sure it happened. But it sure as hell isn't *implausible*. Not for this guy.More like: the very concept of "acceptable targets for violence" is 
 exactly the problem when it comes to ideas that your neighbor might have.  Lets hold polite society to higher standardsYes, it's a crime to punch a Nazi. That's not what this argument is about. It's about morality and history and trying not to repeat it. Punching a Nazi is a morally good thing to do.Interesting stuff but I'm not Americani dont really see that as trump's "M.O." but hey whatever... its just when you guys try to make real accusations its discrediting your argument was my point, but hey i am not the brightest fellaWe may just have different reads of Trump's personality. I see him as a petty, racist, egomaniacal, sexually aggressive but intellectually timid bully for whom no act is below him if it can exact some measure of perceived revenge on an "enemy."

The pee tape idea is fucking outlandish. I agree. I'm almost sorry it's part of a litany of completely believable and increasingly backed-by-evidence claims. It's the one I'm least likely to accept as true without direct evidence to back it up. We may never see that evidence, since if it exists, it's probably under Putin's control. But its placement in the Steele dossier gives it more credibility than had it come from 4chan or whatever the left-wing equivalent of Alex Jones might be, and I'm willing to entertain it as plausible. It's also plausible on its face because I believe Donald Trump is that much of an asshole.Additionally I'm also annoyed at how he is following the exact same topics and canned replies as all the other daily late night hosts. I'm seeing so much more real, important, globally interconnected and interesting news on Reddit or The Intercept or The Phileas Club or Foreign Correspondent or Sinica. Instead he seems continually more distracted and actually boosting Trump by getting dragged along in each new nonsense Twitter spat while truly important stuff like the huge military budget increase is only mentioned in passing. Likewise all the Russia stuff will conclude at some point when the investigation is done, but in the mean time he's missing tons of stuff on how Trump is reshaping America and its politics as well as not learning the lessons to adapt to this new age and maintain his edge.Another subject they were ignorant on was when the compared the Charlottesville nazi rally with the Boston free speech rally. The two events were in no way affiliated but in the high adrenaline fuelled days after Charlottesville, Antifa and the left in general were determined to shout down anything right wing

http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/08/the-boston-rally-and-the-lefts-intolerance-of-free-speech.html
Probably the rehearsal show he does the day before So, can I punch morello because he's a self described communist?&gt; Yes, but this is not what this country is about.
&gt; 

Maybe that's the problem and why Trump won, yeah?&gt; I know the piss story at the moscow hotel was a legit fan theory thing from 4chan though

What is your evidence of this? When the Steele dossier was originally dropped, the fine folks at 4chan and the_don were claiming that the ENTIRE Steele dossier was a 4chan fabrication which obviously turned out to be a desperate lie.It wasn't a joke because he didn't stop and smirk and prod people into laughing. He constantly calls any government spending Socialism. But yeah, people can selectively take any of his statements as a joke if they feel like it.Socialism is worker ownership of the means of production. Public purpose spending isn't socialism, it's the purpose or function of government. Some countries spend very little, and some spend a lot. [Here's a good article on the distinction](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/01/democratic-socialism-government-bernie-sanders-primary-president)I think he has backed off hard from those gmo and vaccine positions, and in the context of the conversation, I think Bills outburst was appropriate.

Because homedude wrote something to the tune of "stoners and trippers are more likely to fall for inconsistent delusions akin to what motivates Redcaps to support trump"  and I just don't think that that correlation implies causation. People's education seems much more related to peoples in ability to think critically (and thus reject delusional beliefs)Tom Morello is like that guy I want to like cause he's cool and he makes valid points but then he just keeps going and makes himself look foolish.

But otherwise thought it was a great episode, lots of good discussions, good panel. Maybe I'm biased but I think John Heilemann is one of the most reasonable people on TV. Loved his show on Bloomberg - With all Due Respect shame it got canceled.If only people had tried to *reason* with Fascists in Italy, Spain and Germany... WW2 never would have happened! So you are going to go out and start shooting your neighbors for thinking of the wrong thoughts? Enjoy your murder conviction Just watched the episode, and I'm not sure what exactly you're referring to. Climate certainly affects weather on a fundamental level. They are not the same, but they are very interconnected. Hurricanes, for instance, are *weather events*. With an increasingly volatile climate, such weather events will occur more frequently and be more extreme. That's his point.
Carbon tax &amp; cap and trade are plans designed to reduce the pollution we create going forward, not to reverse all the pollution we've already put in the atmosphere. That's the difference.Her point was pretty strange in general. She was talking about threatening behavior. That's already illegal. Don't need a law change for that.What you're talking about is *social programs*, not *socialist programs* or *socialism*.Socialism is a distinct political ideology. Social Security isn't socialism, it's a social program. A subtle but important difference.I think he said “we’re better at it” and was probably a joke.  Yeah that's true. I guess I would've liked him to mention the policies he advocates to get to downsizing.Weather is the conditions of the atmosphere at a given moment. Climate is the average of weather over a long period of time, roughly defined as at least 30 years. Climate does not affect weather as much as weather affects climate. The increase in frequency of a weather event shows that the climate has changed. For example, it will take years to figure out if the increase in major hurricanes this year was a result of climate change. The oceans have been getting warmer over the past 30 years, which theoretically would lead to more hurricanes, but look at the [amount of hurricanes in the Atlantic from 1944 to 2010.] (https://i.imgur.com/4MJOBwW.gif) It isn't so cut and dry determining how weather events respond to changes in the climate. Especially since the term "climate" is more related to fundamental aspects of the atmosphere like temperature and precipitation than it is to complex events like hurricanes.Science people and effective communicators often don't mix. Him and Fran Lebowitz. Dear lord don't bring them back. have you seen his show on showtime?What if he was verbally harassing one person?How dare you. Your two countries have a lot in common thoigh. Both were created out of  genocide (2 for the us) by a white racist regime.&gt;nothing more than the act of sitting quietly on a bus while wearing a swastika.

Nothing more than that? Just quietly minding his own business? If someone wore a shirt saying "kill all black people", they should expect to be punched.

&gt;If he was physically harassing people, okay then a punch may very well be justified

You're not even committed to the idea of punching a neo-Nazi harassing black people? No wonder these racist pricks are coming back, with all these sympathetic op-eds and this liberal refusal to beat back solely violent idelogies. are you for real right now? If he's sitting on a bus, minding his own business completely ignoring everyone else while wearing a shirt saying "Kill all black people" (or hey better yet, go all the way, let's say it says "Kill all (n-word)", then if someone were to just walk up to him and punch him, yes that person could be subject to an arrest for assault.

Again, THAT'S WHAT FREE SPEECH IS. It even protects, hell it ESPECIALLY protects, even the speech that you find reprehensible. Granted, maybe the bus driver would have the authority to remove him from the bus, depending on the company's rules on hate speech by customers, but a physical altercation that's not provoked in any way but another physical act? Yep, that's WRONG. You can't just walk up to someone and punch them in the face because you don't like what their clothes say. You can be arrested, and rightly so.

See, what you seem to be advocating, that's exactly the worst sort of "alpha male" attitude that's highlighting the worst of us. Hell, that's the sort of thing bully Trump and his followers would do. well, honestly, I'd at least need more information on that one. Like is the person who's verbally harrassing someone, is he like charging up all in their face to yell at them, while technically not "touching" them, but invading what's reasonably considered an area of their personal space... Tough to say unequivocally just from that one sentence.Yea I mean it seems to me, if you're CONSTANTLY going out of your way to make sure everyone around you knows how unbelievably awesome you are and the best of blah blah blah... that's rather kinda telling. Smacks of insecurity, for one thing. He's not physically threatening. He's sitting down and calling a young black man the n word.Love RAGE but his views I can't say I agree with totally.  I liked what they were about 20 years ago but the world has changed.  I will always be a fan though. The Circus? Yes, that is pretty good actually I should catch up.Yeah that's what I'm saying. Australia and America are very very close in a lot of ways, but there are some interesting differences as well. Aussies for example have stayed a lot closer to Britain so we have a lot of that influence in there. well he is not THAT out of it. fran lebowitz can go fuck herselfI agree with your point in general - I thought Bill should have left that alone. After all, what is being "just high" if it's not an altered perception?

But Bill has been a representative of the marijuana movement for a very, very long time now. I have a feeling that he doesn't feel like giving in on the nuanced details of the effect of pot use when a large portion of the country (especially politicians) still doesn't think he should have the right to use it.

This is also the general frustration that comes with being a Bill Maher fan - some issues he just oversimplifies based on his principles, and won't get into the nuances of. I usually try to ignore those comments and hope that maybe a panel guest will educate him a little here and a little there sometime in the future.I'm all for legalizing it but like you, I get tired of the religious zeal for weed, too. I've seen friends so stoned on pot they can barely function.   

When I saw Maher live on stage a few years ago, he was a little too stoned to be 100%.  It was still a good show and I'm glad I went, but it was obviously effecting his performance and he didn't bring his A game.

The vaccines and GMOs things are incredibly disappointing, too.  He should know better. That makes sense. I had a pretty narrow idea of what the term weather encompasses.
I personally liked the "Fuck fees" one. No, you're not advertising your own subreddit here. 

Das ist verboten. 

Removed, locked and banned. Something something Poole n Rosenthal 2D something rightfun fact : Tom Morello is a member of IWWCarbon tax is never happening.i just hope when i buy a home its trendy outdated like thisJohn Heilemenn is the typical hillary shillUm SV is overwhelmingly liberal bill didn't say that at allHe doesn't think vaccines are dangerous he just thinks spacing them out more isn't the worst idea in the world and it isn't.It's corporate socialism via regulatory capture and you know it.Great. I've been wondering what Russell Brands insightful take on the shooting is. Now I don't have to wonder.Russell Brand is insufferable. He’s a prime example of someone who isn’t half as smart as he thinks he is. I’d rather sit through a two person panel consisting of Ken Bone and Anne Coulter before listening to this idiot make an ass of himself Great, Harold Ford Jr to further bullshit the Democrats toward the right-wing. We need to be going left-ward, not toward the crony-corporatists.Why not try working with the Republicans?I’m glad other people also feel this way.Does this show really need the second interview segment?  The first one is usually serious and has led to some decent conversations.  The second one breaks up momentum and most times has guests either uncomfortable to speak during the rest of the show or talk too much with too little knowledge (like I expect from Brand).He will be a welcome addition, lately the panel has been - 1 disaffected republican, obligatory sjw preferable of color and someone on book tour desperately trying to get a word in.  As much as Maher rails against identity politics and the demise of liberalism he gives a venue to some if its proponents.Man, a lot of Brand hate here, but I enjoy the guy and look forward to his appearance.  The guy is of course no genius, but he can certainly articulate a thought.  Yes, I realize there's more to political commentary than that, but given the people out there who do this for a living, you can do a lot worse than Brand.  He certainly seems passionate about politics and learning more (whether it's genuine is anyone's guess, but it seems so).  

Also, doesn't Maher display that exact behavior, thinking he's smarter than he actually is (at least when it comes to certain issues).  Anyway, I remember Maher took a shot at Brand back in November 2014 regarding voting, so I wonder if they'll discuss that...it could be interesting.  Of course, it could also be a mess, we'll see. I like adding the "non-pro" guest in near the end, but I agree that the 5 mins off interview before they become a part of the panel is a momentum killer.Because they don't want to work with the Democrats?Holy shit, you people are angry and hateful. Jesus.I hate how Congressional bipartisanship is harder to come by than purely just being an asshole to the other side.Would you rather it be an echo chamber? Did you see Russell Brand on Colbert?  I expect him to do all that he can to be the center of attention.  I hope Maher keeps him on a short leash.Russell Brand is one of those guys who I agree with 99% of time and actually has some great ideas and is quite well informed and learned, but the way he presents himself just makes himself seem like a self centered douche and so insufferable that the ideas get lost. I think he is getting better though. 

In the days of Trump, somebody like Brand is an ally not an enemy.Meh,  he is fine,  no dumber nor smarter than anyone else but he can be funny.  I don't see why the hate, serious question though... what did he do to you?I know it's fucking weird actually,  like Russel committed felony buggery or something....calm down on the fake rage boys and girls.I found hilarious how for senior or most vip guests they don't even try to make the person sit back down.Once those motherfuckers started landgrabbing they should have been punched in the face.Not sure if you got my point, the panel has been stuck in a rut. The conversation has changed little since the most historic democratic loss in presendential history, it’s time to change the conversation rather than double down on identity politics Olivia Nuzzi was recently shown to have been in a ring of sleazy journalists who would pass on stories to Breitbart and Milo Yiannopolous, so hopefully she gets called out for being full of shit.Definitely will be an interesting episode Billy Crystal was great And Russell Brand has been darkhorse goodThis shilling for the Iran deal is kind of weird.  The IAEA just admitted that military facilities are not allowed to be inspected.  That was the main reason the deal was signed, and without inspectors there is literally no way to know if it's working.  I'm not necessarily saying we need to pull out but people saying "it's working!" have literally no idea if there aren't inspectors.  Even the senate minority leader is against it.Russell Brand is normally verbal diarrhea but he makes some good points.  Kind of funny to see Nuzzi say "I'm not a on a team" in response to Ford.  Everyone complains about tribalism but calling your political party a team is just that.Imo I thought he kind of was verbal diarrhea tonight. Him and Nuzzi almost ruined the show for me.His ramblings were surprisingly cohesive Idk, he uses a lot of words but I knew what he was saying.  As a massive Russell brand fan, I was actually expecting him to choke. On panel shows, he struggles to be in his element. He was better than I expected. His verbose nature is worse when he is nervous and I saw a lot of that tonight. However, he is a quick wit and he was really funny. 

I remember watching him on a UK tv program called "Have I Got News for You" quite a few years ago. He had the same problem but there was one fact another panelist slipped up on and Russell completely destroyed him after Russell had been the running joke all night long.

Link...bit long and old but that moment is toward the end.
 http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xrvz46Nuzzi literally only spoke like twice, both times to shut down that career politicians bs.He still did very well considering his nervous nature on panel shows. He is still sharp in wit and hilariously verbose. Panel shows really aren't his strong suit. However, the man is damned talented. I still pick up his first book now and then to read.can someone explain the boston tea party joke that Brand said in on Overtime? I'm not American sorryHe was referencing the pre-Revolutionary War when America first started to want to be a country to itself separate from England. Basically he was saying doesn't it look like a better idea to have stayed with England considering the mess we are in now.I just really feel bad. You could see Bill was getting pretty annoyed at times. I hope he comes on the show againI think Bill should have known what he was getting. For some reason, Russell tends to shine the most with others around. He is not for everyone but I have always loved Russell. For me, the camera just gravitates to him. I love Bill but he was never going to outshine Russell. And Russell admits whole heartedly in his comedy that he loves attention.More exhaustive complaints at Trump almost solely for being insensitive and rude. But when people criticize Bill for being insensitive and rude? Triggered PC Millennial snowflakes whining for a safe space from "real talk". Either cut down on the respectability politics or stop whining about the PC police.

The most discriminated against people? Old people.

A law to encourage people not to look at the phones while they cross the street, that noone will enforce, is bad. Sure, it'll save a few lives, but millions will be late! As everyone knows, tiny regulations that noone even knows exist are why Democrats lose.

Lastly, I'm convinced the only celebrities he invited on the panel are people he wants to feel up.he needed some downers because he's annoying AF without it. Brand was fucking intolerable during Overtime. He wouldn't let anybody get a sentence in, and kept interrupting everyone when they tried to get a thought out.  

Dude, shut up. The show isn't about you.Really wish Nuzzi got involved more. She said like 2 things all night. Billy crystal 😂😂😂And they were both "I'm not on any team."  
  
Ditzy broad.This was the most tolerable I have ever seen Brand, for me it was a breath of fresh air...because blind allegiance isn't problematic?I'd take it over people who use the word problematic.https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--zHvW4gK3--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/wnfyyiakckla7hs0ptqb.jpgIt annoys the fuck out of me. that being said, it's Russell's schtick and I think they brought him on knowing that.He seemed pretty comfortable to me. maybe too comfortable?Funny I was getting annoyed with Bill during the main show because there were a few times he asked Brand a question and then just either ignored the answer or tried to cut him off with a joke. I haven't missed an episode of Real Time in years, but this episode felt like a lecture. There was no debate between any of the guests. Even the token (sort of) right winger Steve Schmidt was an MSNBC Republican.

Olivia Nuzzi barely said a word all episode, and Russell Brand always sounds like a paranoid twit who does way too much cocaine (despite what he says).

The fun episodes are the ones with people like Ann Coulter or S.E. Cupp who can hold their own in an argument, or at least just start one."Thoughts are the opposite of prayers."
Yeah, Bill. Kind of like, oh, I don't know, War and Peace  The hypocrisy Bill showed during his final "new rule" drove me up the wall. Every argument he made against regulations for the topics he brought up are the near exact same arguments he and other anti-2nd amendment advocates make for regulations of firearms regarding mass shootings. 
Examples: You're not likely to be directly affected by it yet you pay the price to prevent something less likely than being struck by lightning, why should manufacturers be held responsible for the actions of people who misuse their product, how redundant or pointless mitigations ultimately fail to stop the criminally negligent, etc.

"Should reminding you not to forget your baby really be Toyota's problem?" Ok, now replace that with "Should reminding you not to murder innocent people really be Smith and Wesson's problem?"

He throws in a "where does this stop...toilet ice?" slippery slope argument which 2nd amendment advocates are prone to do as well. 

He then throws in sarcastically "but if it saves one life..." and proceeds to ask would it be worth it. Which is exactly what gun folks say when gun regulation comes up. "We're never going to get this down to zero until we get rid of kids altogether." Again, replace kids with guns and have a republican say it and Bill would never stop ripping them a new asshole. 

"Democrats don't want to help people they just want to micromanage." He says this like it's not true when not 40 mins earlier he is talking about gun control. 

And to top it off he starts the whole rant by shitting on parents who have inadvertently been responsible for their child's death like a gigantic unsympathetic asshole. 

This is not a rant for or against gun control but rather the way he was talking out of both sides of his mouth. How can he not hear himself? The bubble is on both sides, Bill.  Brand is a fucking moron going back to the Bernie was screwed well. You can't compare gerrymandering voting districts to a party of diverse voters rejecting someone who was trying to speak to the white working class only. That was a shit stain of a show with those guests but at least Bill showed some anger towards Brand trying to make it seem like Hillary would be just as bad as Trump. Is he ever not? I think he did well, valid points and a few laughs. People are far too harsh on Brand....calling him not clever is just wrong imho.

Whoever that women was she was overly triggered by the use of the term team.Let's be honest,  is his insightful points better than yours though?His schtick is interrupting people?Why do people need to want the same level of regulation on every issue? Not sure who your rant is aimed at...With the flowery over the top language, yepSurprised nobody is talking about Harold Ford in here yet. I found him insufferable.  Bill brought up the interpretation of the 2nd Amendment regarding slavery/slave revolts... and Ford immediately went back into his talking point about a completely different issue.  This isn't a campaign debate, it's a discussion.He really needs to speak at about half his current speed...I do like Brand funny and intelligent and he's experienced a lot He was a great guest on the joe rogan experience. He does better in long form conversations rather than just trying to jump in here and thereI'm not at all sure what op is talking about here because I thought he did really well. He's ridiculously intelligent, verbose and loquacious. He made some good points and somehow was still really funny. Also, despite me being a straight man, the dude just fucks the camera.Problem is, on a panel show with four other people if you take a breath while speaking someone will cut you off.Confused?  
  
Allow me to [enlighten you.](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-daum-the-problem-with-problematic-20160721-snap-story.html)Jesus Russel Brand is intolerableYes. The young factor in Hollywood has always been there but there are a shit ton of biases on the pop culture industry besides just age. But broadly speaking, boomers also have a ridiculous amount of power in America. And not just that, but i probably see older people shitting on young people 10X more than the other way around. Its almost fashionable to shit on millennials. Thats not true the other way around. 

It honestly sounds like Bill is having a hard time accepting his age and wants to play some weird victim card.  What about that cocaine joke? I; kinda hated that one, little cheap and unnecessary for me. It seems like Bill wanted to say: dont listen to this drug addict! But... i think i took it the wrong way

I loved that everytime Bill turned to him to ask: do you know ....; Brand started to explain what it was.

Not counting the Cocaine joke, I loved it. Two sides of the progressive ideology talking fast and talking smart!

Would love more!Him and Bill seemed to work off each other really well. Maybe I need to watch the bit again, but I thought the point he was trying to make is that older people are too often given a free pass for saying and doing shitty things under the guise of 'that's how things were done when I was young'. Look at Harvey weinstein for example.&gt; "Should reminding you not to forget your baby really be Toyota's problem?" Ok, now replace that with "Should reminding you not to murder innocent people really be Smith and Wesson's problem?"

No to both. I'm not sure what the hell you're getting at.
What a weird closing editorial. Toilet ice... wtf?

Toilet ice hasn't been a problem since when, like the 1980s? And even then it wasn't by design. The plane's onboard sewage tanks and pipes would leak fluid out on to the fuselage where it would freeze. At lower altitude it would melt, break off and seriously fuck shit up on the ground which is why the system was overhauled to the waterless thing there is today. No leaking, no toilet ice.Brand is switched on, just wish he was a little more concise.It was aimed at Bill not any specific issue. I just didn't see how he could call for more regs in one issue but dismiss regs for another that is also a life and death topic (child left in carseat). It just didn't seem like it intellectually jived imho.That's my point! What I found hypocritical was why he would make the argument for one but not the other.Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think Bill Maher is advocating for safety features on guns. He's advocating that certain things (like bump stocks) be banned, which is a completely different thing.That's Junior, though. He's still stuck in the same mindset he got himself into after he lost a Senate race in 2006. He's still got his eyes focused on some future campaign he's still hoping will come along. He blew it one good time, learned all the wrong lessons from it, and keeps re-living that moment over and over again in his head. That's why he always comes off like he's auditioning for a job, because he is.

(Before anyone gets on my case about calling him Junior, no joke that's his nickname. He was my congressman. It's to distinguish him from his father, who has the same name and who was also my representative in Congress for 20 years. When he ran for his father's seat, he put up signs all over town that simply said, "Jr.") I've only ever seen him in Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Ger Him to the Greek lol. Needless to say, I was pretty surprised at how well-versed he was on most of the topics that were brought up. 

But as someone else brought up, the drug bit was a little off putting. You don't hear many people say about heroin "it's the most relaxing drug" or something along those lines. Although he did follow it up with "it ends with your life" He'll complain about ageism in one breath and then complain about young people in the next. I just wish he would pick one or the other.Brand really won me over. He was a little over-exposed for a while and now I enjoy him again. And his calling out Bill on Bill's infatuation with Hillary was great. Supporting Bernie Sanders and not falling for Bill's Hillary baiting was my favorite part of the show.I agree, I don't know why everyone on this subreddit is getting their panties in a bunch. Probably his comment though about the DNC rigging the primary for that failed candidate. She who shall not be named. [I loved his segment on the show about this](https://youtu.be/pkFJvHepN2g?t=3m30s).Everyone I've heard describe heroin says something similar to Russell.[Watch this if you like him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFXNzNiA0EM&amp;t)I've seen him a bit and I like him but I can also understand why he's too much for some. His answer about LSD was very detailed (which is not unusual for him) - wonder if he was tripping. His facial expressions, mannerisms, and eye movement were strange even for him...This is him on [BBC Question Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2RSKJC-ugk). At times he comes across as right arrogant prick at others sensible. If he could tone down the right-on left attitude he could almost be like a UK Al Franken?Didn't he try to run in NY too?

edit: Yes in 2010Because those two issues are different? Not sure why you have a problem with it at all.Maher briefly flashing with rage (that's an exaggeration, maybe, but he seemed way too upset) anytime the audience's reaction to a joke didn't meet his expectations was obnoxious and unpleasant. I've actually never seen a comedian get mad at an audience for not finding a joke funny. Laughter is involuntary. Maher saw red throughout the show. It's like...just move on. Roll with it. It's fine. They don't have to laugh. 

This is just a vague hunch, but he also seemed to resent Brand (i.e., Maher started off the interview with such a backhanded compliment). I suspect this is because Maher didn't know how to enter into a repartee with someone whose comedy style is so florid and fast-paced. I agree tbh. I enjoy the show a lot more when there's actually discussion and not just 3 democrats agreeing with Bill on everything.Brand was just on the Rogan podcast too. Very enjoyable. 

Edit: Link: https://youtu.be/iZPH6r_ZDvMI liked some of his takes, but his (and Bill's) comedy seems outdated. Howard Cosell narrating the administration might play well with 50+ year olds I guess.At the heart of those two issues you have 1) personal responsibility and 2) regulations that the public majority will bear the burden and cost of without the likelihood they’ll ever be directly affected by. So, by this metric I think they are very similar. 

I get that one is a sexier, more emotionally inspired issue (guns) and the other is usually argued with an air of moral superiority and indignation almost across the board. But, if you’re for progressive gun control and regulation I just don’t get how you couldn’t be for comparable automotive regulation and vice versa. Maher always does that to the audience when they don’t get his joke.

I always roll my eyes every time he does it.He's a raving dilettante and I thoroughly enjoy him as long as he concedes how little he knows.  

When he starts to act like he has authority on anything, he can get annoying. Then, he starts to turn into a Jenny McCarthy or Victoria Jackson or Dennis Miller and the act fizzles.&gt; I was pretty surprised at how well-versed he was on most of the topics that were brought up. 

It's pretty obvious he's  coached and prepped on all topics that are to be discussed. And not that there's anything wrong with that. But when Brand gives a rote definition of gerrymandering,  he gets points for memorization, nothing more.

Speaking on that topic of prepping (but off-topic as to Brand): **I could not believe how stale the Billy Crystal segment was.**  Jesus Christ.  Usually, when someone has written up and is going through a prepared act, it's not so blatantly obvious. And its usually really funny, because theyve had days and hours to tone it up.  But with Crystal, he might just as well have been overtly reading from a script, a bad script at that. Every joke/riff he recited was such a noticeably artificial response to Bill Maher's layup question. And, he even had to reach all the way back and dust off a riff on Howard Cosell. *Howard Cosell!* Whose heyday was the '70s and who's been dead over 20 years.  Why didn't he throw in a few Nixon or Ike jokes while he was at it?  Oh, Billy....  that segment was mostly dead.&gt; if you’re for progressive gun control and regulation I just don’t get how you couldn’t be for comparable automotive regulation and vice versa.  

Sounds like you have a difficult time "getting" things in general then.Ooh, an op-ed that cites a Gawker article...Really? That’s your argument. No counter-point? You just jump to insulting my intelligence? Fuck off and go troll somebody else. I listen to podcasts at 1.5-1.8 speed....you get used to the speed but that was the first time I had to concentrate in order to understand someone. I don't think Maher gets annoyed if the audience doesn't like his joke because it's lame but my impression is that if their dislike comes from a stance of sensibility, that's when he'll give everyone The Look. He frequently complains that some people get too easily offended. I get where he's coming from though I don't have the same reaction as he does. 

That being said, Maher getting angry with his audience is always amusing to me for some reason. The whole premise of your thinking is flawed. They are 2 different issues and should be treated separate. It would be like claiming someone is a hypocrite for thinking the government should stay out of peoples' sex lives, but at the same time thinking they should play a role in gun regulation. It makes no sense to expect the same regulatory expectations across different issues.50% of the reason I watch is to watch Maher get pissed when his cornier jokes get no reaction. This week's was a beut. I even watched it in slow motion a few times. I loved his comments about his ~~40,000 bees~~, [I stand corrected, 60,000 bees](https://youtu.be/8NaJdHZSPqM?t=6m38s). Very Hilarious.Wtf are you taking about, he's brilliantYeah and she didn't get much talking time.Honestly though, the jokes that struck out this week didn't deserve laughs. Some of them were just straight up bad punch lines. It's more common that he'll say jokes that the audience doesn't understand initially and gets no reaction... this time, it was deserved. Resent Brand? He was hunched over laughing several times when Brand was speaking.I guess I must have focused on his other vibes. Also, to be honest, that bowled over with laughter thing seemed kind of phoney on Maher's part, but what do I know? Im a regular Australian and i know what gerrymandering is. Seems reasonable that Brand would also. I thought that whole rant followed up later on with a really lazy "Alien vs Pensioner" joke was pretty weird. Explaining a concept that seemed to escape you (even though it was pretty clear).  really? I thought he was an extremely annoying clown!

he never contributed anything to the CONVERSATION. he just liked to make statements, like they were pre-written. it's a talk show where you have to talk to other people - not talk at them. I 100% agree. I have never got the appeal of him, he derails conversations as well. I swear he is autistic because he makes people uncomfortable when they are interviewing him and I'm not sure he pics up on it. 

I don't think for one second he is stupid but he ruined the panel at the end &amp; OT was just wasted. would you have the perfect, broadcast-ready definition ready for recitation?  its not a stretch to think that all guests are given  the topics ahead of time.Funny--I thought Brand was ok, but during that specific part of Overtime, I don't think he really responded to Maher's points well at all.  Brand mostly replied with platitudes and gibberish.I thought he was fine. Could have gone more in depth, to be sure, but that's difficult when your points are being actively downplayed, minimized, and accused of cocaine use when you get impassioned. What is "right-on left attitude?"&gt;It's pretty obvious he's  coached and prepped on all topics that are to be discussed. 

This is such bullshit. Baseless assertion. This nonsense comment of yours says more about you than it does Brand, or even Crystal for that matter. 

"Someone concisely articulating points I disagree with must obviously be coached."

Bullshit. https://i.imgur.com/RzvpUgz.gif&gt; right-on left attitude?"

Virtue signally, can't say this or that, criticising without actual solutions, know what they are against but not what they are pro.

[read this](https://life.spectator.co.uk/2016/10/a-handy-guide-to-left-wing-people-for-the-under-10s/)

Yeah, this is a bunch of bullshit. You just don't like what he has to say, so as is typical in modern political discussion, you punch left to lift up the right. The delivery was off so he has no one to blame but himself. He’s a pretty smart guy. People shit in for for various reasons unfortunately.So, you've just demonstrated what an idiot you are. Every talk show you ever watch is "coached".  Do you think that smoothly flowing conversation flows that way by accident? Every talk show guest has a line producer who goes over with the guest how the conversation is supposed to run.  Maher's format is slightly different from Jimmy Kimmel, but the mechanics are still the same. All guests are prepped/coached. And guests who don't want to look stupid undoubtedly do their own "studying" ahead of time.

As for Crystal-- you think he is just making that (ostensibly) comedic reference to Cosell up on the spot?  Its not even a question if Crystal had an entire script ready for his segment. Crystal's entire segment was [INSERT CRYSTAL COMEDY BIT HERE].

But, hey, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say that you are just pretending to be an ignorant idiot.&gt;So, you've just demonstrated what an idiot you are. Every talk show you ever watch is "coached". 

If you think that "true" then why did you single out Brand as if he's the exception to the rule? If everybody on a talk show is coached, why is Brand doing it something to criticize? Other than you simply don't like him and disagree with him. Which is fine, but be honest.  

And you call me an idiot. Fucking please..I certainly wasnt singling him out, you git.   You're somehow trying to defend *and concede* a point at the same time.  You're a demonstrable idiot.&gt;I certainly wasnt singling him out, you git.

Yes, you were. 

&gt;You're somehow trying to defend *and concede* a point at the same time.  You're a demonstrable idiot.

Your inability to wrap your smooth-brain around an argument isn't itself a counter argument. Well, he kept ranting on instead of just stating his points (which were very generic ideas).You say ranting, I say trying not to get cut off by Maher who's simply going to allude to cocaine use to hand wave away the points being made. 

"Generic ideas" is a meaningless nonsense phrase. Just be honest, say you disagree with him. I have no problem saying I disagree with him.






An example of his “generic ideas” is ‘not voting at all if you think all the political parties are bad choices”. This is not a new idea, and his reasoning for doing so was the generic view of ‘they’re all corrupt so I won’t support them’. It’s a little more complex than that.








As for being cut off, Olivia Nuzzi was the one who wasn’t really given the chance to speak.Yeah that's probably true. But it's still funny.The more I concentrate on Jordan Peterson, the more annoying I find him. Like, the way he goes on about things, his voice, and the way he seems so condescending. I thought the cocaine joke was funny because I thought the same thing.  She kept getting talked over.  I think she had more to contribute.A panel of Ken Bone and Ann Coulter would be awkward, infuriating and entertaining at the same time.  &gt; Brand is a fucking moron going back to the Bernie was screwed well.

Why? He was.


&gt; someone who was trying to speak to the white working class only.

You're completely wrong about that.As others have mentioned, he shits on millennials way too much for me to take his complaints seriously. 

He has legitimate concerns: People like to jump the gun and say that someone is too old to do something, and that is wrong.

But, fuck me, Bill is the MASTER at generalizing *anyone* under the age of 30 to a pokemon playing, safe space toting, SJW with a participation trophy and is constantly on their FaceTubes.The overall message was on point. Every week I see my fellow democrats proposing something in the name micromanagement when really they just want attention and for people to think *"Uh, tickle my tits, wow they really care about that issue, look how smart and progressive they are blah, blah, bah"* and I just think "that shit is going to get Trump re-elected."

When the body goes through hypothermia it cuts off a lot of blood flow to the extremities to help keep the internal body temperature at the heart, head and other vital organs up. Democrats had better start doing the same. Sure losing mobility in your hands sucks, but we've got a brain to heat up. Shit is going to be sacrificed.

With that being said . . .

His examples weren't all that great.
Seat belts and airbags protect you from other people's bad driving. Not sure if that's the best analogy. If you don't want an alarm going off every time you leave a box of something on your back seat, because you don't have any children, then you shouldn't be forced to have one. Everyone should have airbags and seat belts. If it were an option to turn the alarm off, like passenger-side airbags were for a while, then it think it's a moot point.Your rant makes no sense. Take a breath dude.Also seat belts and airbags ensure when said individual takes an emergency room visit after an accident, and they do not have health insurance, it promises a less costly trip which can subsequently translate to taxpayer dollars. No seatbelt? No health insurance? More costly to everyone else, the negative externalities economically are to great to sacrifice. Same principle lies with helmetsWhen a person leaves their kid or dog in the car and it dies, the taxpayer has to pay to prosecute and incarcerate that/those parents. What about that externality? If we're talking about economics.&gt; The overall message was on point. Every week I see my fellow democrats proposing something in the name micromanagement when really they just want attention and for people to think

Like? I'm a Democrat and rarely see new proposals from actual Democratic politicians that isn't sensible. Done. Do you care to explain why my rant makes no sense?

By the way, if what I wrote is a rant, then so is Bill's New Rules these days, when he spews it at the audience.

Can you tell me why Bill only hoses liberals in his New Rules and interviews?He'll say Millennials are the worst generation when he's a part of the generation that oversaw the downfall of the greatest and most prosperous middle class of any nation in the world, the waste of life thrown at Vietnam, the invention of supply-side economics and Reagonomics in which the rich trickle-down their piss onto the poor, the various major international fuck-ups when we regularly overthrew governments in order tried to install democrats/authoritarians that liked us, and the Iraq war, to name just a few.

Yeah the Baby Boomers really did a stand-up job Bill, keep shitting on younger people while we try to clean up your mess.He literally helicoptered in for a fundraiser while he was working for Merrill Lynch.Bill has his own form of political correctness, e.g. all politically incorrect jokes must evoke only positive reactions. 
And he was referencing "mad" King George III who was the King of Britain when the Boston Tea Party happened (a reaction to taxation without representation and the generally shitty treatment of the colonists by the King and the Parliament).He'll say Millennials are the worst generation when he's a part of the generation that oversaw the downfall of the greatest and most prosperous middle class of any nation in the world, the waste of life thrown at Vietnam, the invention of supply-side economics and Reagonomics in which the rich trickle-down their piss onto the poor, the various major international fuck-ups when we regularly overthrew governments in order tried to install democrats/authoritarians that liked us, and the clusterfuck that is (and seemingly forever will be) the Iraq war, to name just a few. Oh, and the systematic destruction of the environment, which is in Bill's opinion the biggest danger to human life on Earth (arguable, with nukes floating around).

Yeah the Baby Boomers really did a stand-up job Bill, keep shitting on younger people while we try to clean up your mess.I don't like anyone who monopolizes time with soliloquy.I imagine the frequency of the latter is much higher than that of what OP originally posted aboutOkay, so I just watched Overtime for this episode. One of the questions asked Harold Ford Jr., the final chairman of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council before it died a well-earned death, whether the Democratic Party was moving too far to the left. Whoever selects those questions sucks. Just what in the hell did they expect him to say? That was the softest of softball questions. They may as well have asked, "Who do you think should lead the party in the coming years, and why is it you?"

Then they waste the rest of the segment on the fact that Russell Brand is apparently the only person in the known universe who hasn't heard the story of the time Bill got sued by Trump a hundred times already.

Something seriously stinks with this show these last few episodes, and while I don't know enough about show business to put my finger on exactly what it is, I definitely recognize the familiar stink of executive interference. Either that, or Bill's just getting old and he's lost touch with the direction of the country at exactly the worst possible time. That's a major problem with these types of panels. Sometimes I think they ought to get rid of all the mics on set and just have one handheld microphone that gets passed around the table. Nobody gets to butt in until the person presently speaking is done.&gt;Done. Do you care to explain why my rant makes no sense?  

Because those safety measures are completely different  

&gt;Can you tell me why Bill only hoses liberals in his New Rules and interviews?  

Do you honestly think Bill never goes after Trump/conservatives in New Rules??!! You have to be kidding.

Ya, we really need Bill to remind us every fucking episode that "Hillary would be better than Trump," and that it's Bernie supporters' faults that she didn't get elected. Give me a fucking break. She had everyone on her side (including 3mil more of the electorate, the corrupt DNC, and a VAST majority of the news media, including people like Bill with huge audiences who never even considered voting for a non-corporate supported Democrat). No, of fucking course Hillary wouldn't be as bad as Trump, but that doesn't mean we can't talk about WHY people didn't vote for her and we can't keep acting like everyone who suggests the reasons why she was a shit candidate is somehow a Trump supporter. I don't know what it will take for people like you and Bill to have some political self-awareness of our party, and I'm honestly surprised that a year later that you guys are still spouting the same bullshit.What will it take for people like you to be self aware that calling everyone neo liberal shills and shit all over anyone who dares speak ill of your dear leader Bernie? His movement was a joke, all he did was inspire more leftie conspiracy theorists who cried rigged because too many minorities voted for Hillary. According to you guys, they just didn't know better because Bernie marched once with MLK. Holy shit, you are like a caricature of everything that's wrong with our party. Neo liberal shills? Conspiracy theorists? "they just didn't know better because Bernie march one with MLK..." What in the fuck are you even talking about? Where did I mention any of that? 
I'm perfectly happy criticizing Bernie because I know some of his policies were too idealistic. You can't even defend Clinton, all you can try and do is pin some horse shit talking points on me. Maybe take a step back and try to realize that there's a reason almost half of our party decided to not continue to support centrist Democrats who are more than happy to sell out to corporate interests and perpetuate a state of eternal warfare around the world. Regulating car manufacturers to install another annoying relay that I have to pull is far less important than sensible gun regulations or doing something to combat the irreversible damage we have done to the planets climate. The analogy was spot on; why regulate the odd inattentive idiot when a group of greedy misanthropes are intent on killing every living thing on the planet.

Obviously you think it's important to protect children, but do you really think adding a sensor to new vehicles that most of us can't afford is as important as combating child exploitation, trafficking or pornography?  

The real irony of the situation, if the law is passed to install these sensors in new vehicles, the sensors and relay modules will probably be  assembled by children for sub standard wages.That's because Harold Ford Jr. is always, 100% of the time, full of shit. Never trust that dude, he's done nothing to earn it and he's done a hell of a lot to deserve mistrust. He voted for the bankruptcy bill, he stormed across the House floor to vote for the Terri Schaivo bill, and he literally told George W. Bush that he loved him. I'm embarrassed that he's from my town. He's a bullshit artist down to the core of his soul, if he even has one.He just comes across as a slimey politician who'll do whatever it takes to get elected and then not give a shit about anything else.  It's just really weird to see someone talk about politics the way he does. Then you'd hate me&gt; and perpetuate a state of eternal warfare around the world.

Where is this taking place?By that logic each criminal statute is economic in nature..........He was arguing against a nanny state, as he always does. Yes, that is true.

Imprisoning people for possession of a few grams of weed is indeed an economic matter.Process for replying to this post:

1. Try to think of a dumb Democratic proposal
2. Fail
3. Downvote and leave&gt; Because those safety measures are completely different

That's a fantastic distinction. Very meaningful.

&gt;
Do you honestly think Bill never goes after Trump/conservatives in New Rules??!! You have to be kidding.

Not never, just un-proportionally. He seems to think he does more good shitting on liberals than he does cons. Well he's wrong, and needs to know he's wrong.You are really living in an alternate reality there...Statements like yours are a retreat to an appeal to tradition, instead of an actual legitimate (non-fallacious) argument. I expected no less, but hoped for more.

No problem though."Stupid as fuck" probably not the best way to start trying to form an intelligent argument. Looks like everyone else in the thread disagrees with you as well.His description of LSD was actually quite spot on
Two major points:

First, there's kind of a huge gap in scale.

Automotive accidents are the single leading non-natural cause of death in this country.

We've made enormous strides and while we can't say "this person was saved because of an airbag" or "this person would have been saved 30 years ago if only they had an airbag", we *can* look at statistics as a whole.  And we know that tens of thousands of people are alive today because of lots of incremental improvements to automotive performance and crash survivability.

Contrast that with hot car deaths.  Yes, they're tragic.  But they're super rare.  The number of lives that could be saved is what?  [Tens per year](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS6a-JgebWAhWIdSYKHcvtCHAQFggvMAI&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2016%2F08%2F05%2Fhealth%2Fhot-car-deaths-charts-trnd%2Findex.html&amp;usg=AOvVaw37ZSCmOx-aeGWP9hNOWG0g)?

Contrast that with the 35,000 deaths per year *after* all these advances in safety from accidents.

Secondly, there's also the difference in the kind of threat.  Leaving your kid in a hot car because you forgot about them *is not normal*.

But if you drive enough, statistically you will get into some kind of accident in the U.S. every 160,000 miles.  And there's 1.13 fatalities per 100 Million miles traveled.

That's a lot more likely and a lot more out of your control.  Blowouts, other drivers not paying attention, mechanical malfunction, being blinded by the sun, black ice, flooded roads and hydroplaning, just plain being distracted.  There are a zillion things that contribute to accidents that make them more of a baked-in part of driving a car than forgetting your kid in the back seat.Identity politics of the left has "trumped" the usual politics of working and regular people who live in this country. The "great ignorant masses of Nazis and fascists" who have jobs and pay taxes and fees to these expensive universities; who will not change genders; who use clever language instead of potty-mouth invectives; those scorned by entitled snowflake safespace goofballs. 

Those very same goofballs who rely on privledged, Hollywood and media big mouths to give them their opinons and make sure they don't deviate from the dialogue. 

Expect more rules not less the more these people take power. It's a substitute for doing anything that needs doing. The Democratic Party you once knew no longer exists. 
So you follow up your fallacy with an appeal to the majority. 

Do you even know how to think critically?Your well-reasoned arguments free of ad hominem have persuaded me that the points you are making are rational and correct. Cuz, I mean, c’mon Bill! Lmao. My arguments are well-reasoned, and *ad hominem* fallacies are those in which the ad hominem replaces the initial argument. Please read a little bit about logic before trying to explain to others how to use it.lol

how PC of youI’m not trying to explain to use how to use logic, where did you get that? I’m highlighting that your lack of logic and resort to name-calling isn’t convincing anyone of whatever it is you’re trying to say. &gt; (1) I’m not trying to explain to use how to use logic, where did you get that? (2) I’m highlighting that your lack of logic and resort to name-calling isn’t convincing anyone of whatever it is you’re trying to say.

You realize these two statements are contradictory, right?

(1) =&gt; ~(2)Appeal to majority? Simply asking you to do some introspection. People have explained to you why youre wrong. Theres a reason you are being downvoted... Oh, you're one of them.

You think I give a fuck what some anonymous redditors think about my opinions? Have you noticed how I have held fast to my convictions in spite of those downvotes? I'm not pliable to things like "downvotes," perhaps unlike you...

Maybe you should do some introspection...Well apparently not only do you not know how to use logic, your reading comprehension isn’t all that great either. Stop trying to get points by creating false contradictions. I do not care enough to spend my time educating you about logic, not what I’m here to you. I’m just pointing out to you that you post has no arguments, and obviously no convincing ones,  and therefore isn’t persuasive. Read slowly. Understand?http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/05/health/hot-car-deaths-charts-trnd/index.html

36 a year. Not counting all pets or K-9s that are killed.

Can car manufacturers not walk and chew gun at the same time? Basically all of them are working on self-driving vehicles e.g. artificial intelligence, which will reduce fatalities dramatically. Can they also not reduce the number of hot car deaths dramatically at the same time? Do you think their resources are really that limited?

I think the families of those 36 children would wish that their vehicles had those sensors at minimal extra cost. If you want to factor in the human impact of your and Bill's analysis.

Please have some imagination.You made the post, so you must have wanted to hear what redditors think about your opinions at some point.Yet people will complain that they can't afford a decent new car on a working class salary like the good old days, and then argue in favor of mandating sensors like this and never put two and two together.No, I wanted them to hear my opinions. Their feedback was not my primary goal.You should try replacing emotion with logicThen why are you even on this sub? Just go yell at a wallA little late aren't you?  This is from July. Talk about fake outrage...Jesus Christ Twitter is full to the hilt with delicate flowers...fake outrage.It isn't racist because he is obviously being facetious. Anyone in the right mind would be freaking out, not only the people working in his nail salon.  Yeah of course this is racist&gt; Seat belts and airbags protect you from other people's bad driving. Not sure if that's the best analogy.

Oh come on, even if they only saved you from your own driving they should still be illegal not to have

Moreover, who is the baby-sensor saving, and who from? It's perfectly analogous: it's saving *the baby* from its parents fucking up, which they.

To get shrill for a second, Bill would rather more babies get left in cars and overheat and die rather than pay a little more for a car. I'd be a little more empathetic if he was actually affected by this at all.Abso*lutely* he's a whiny little bitch on this

*Of course* "the last group in America it's okay to shit on" includes him. *Of course*, Bill. Let's pour one out for old people and belittle the real shitting-on that happens to black people, women, gay people, and young people every day.

How can he be so not self-aware? He spends so much time showing how you can get away treating millennials and trans people like punching bags and still be seen as some liberal icon. But yeah, *Bill Maher* is a member of the last oppressed minority over here.Omg lol no that's not what he's saying. He was saying that people make fun of old too much, on a show where he generalizes and shits on all kinds of people..... most poignantly young peopleOmg these people are cancer. Twitter is incurable.The joke is not racist because it would still be funny if it were told by someone of another ethnicity. The joke is that Bill goes to a nail salon, and nail salons in LA are disproportionately owned and staffed by Korean women. This is a cultural distinction that Bill is using as a conceptual basis for the joke.there are more anti Maher, anti Democrat, alt right people on this fucking sub then there are Maher fans. Fucking Republican 4chan kids every time there is a post in this sub. Fuck you guys.Fan checking in. The haters are real. It's not that its outrageous or anything. It's just dumb, lazy, bad comedy.

https://twitter.com/shujaxhaider/status/883449961609822209Not just LA; from Vancouver to Toronto, every nail salon I have seen has been disproportionately owned, operated and staffed by Korean women.I'm a fan of Maher.  And I hate Hillary,  voted for Trump.  I understand the alt-left thinks everything should fit neatly in their feelings bubble,  however that's not the case in the real world. So, the joke is: he sees Asians at his nail salon freaking out, and he assumes that North Korea tensions must be bad? that doesn't even make senseI'm not late. Is there a timestamp on when I can talk about it? And it's literally from just a few months ago, and about an issue that still is in the news todayNo... the funny part is that he goes to a nail salon...So you are here to troll?... How do you sleep at night? Honestly... Maher is probably the most out spoken critic of your orange Messiah. I suggest if you want people in your thought bubble you should head right over to the Donald sub. Alt left? How do you even come up with that? Everyone that doesn't agree with you is alt left... Fuck back off to.You're not late but you are a snowflakeI don't know that I'd call Cracked news. The tweet is not racist as it does not imply superiority over Koreans. Maybe a bit prejudiced about a stereotypical aspect of Korean industriousness in America, but definitely not racist. If you think that joke is racist enough to make a post about it, you better check yourself or ask for a raise from your propaganda chief, ya troll.I am going to bannish you to the shadow realm now.How does that same logic apply to airbags and seat belts? You just said that the point Bill is making is it would prevent only a "few" deaths, so the logic is a cost-benefit analysis. The cost of implementing this new measure is higher than the benefit. On the other hand, seat belts and airbags save thousands of lives a year, if not more, I'd have to look it up. Regardless, it's definitely much more than a "few." That's why it's different. 36 is too small a number to burden all of society. People have to take personal responsibility for some things. But hey, if those 36 families want to pool their money and buy extra backseat censors for their own cars as a special added installation, I'm sure they can. Well then, since you are defending Bill's Libertarian stance, can you defend the idea that the lives of children are not "worth more" since they lack agency?

Someone can never wear a seatbelt in their life and make it through if they are careful and lucky. That's agency. What agency does a kid left in the backseat have? 

Shouldn't regulations exist EXACTLY TO protect the most vulnerable?

You and Bill miss the point of regulation in the interest of some right-wing circlejerk about "only 36 deaths" (that's kind of a lot, assholes).&gt; Well then, since you are defending Bill's Libertarian stance, can you defend the idea that the lives of children are not "worth more" since they lack agency?

You idiots think the point is to save the parents and the taxpayer. No. It's to save the fucking kid. Jesus I swear some of the people on this subreddit are uber-morons.Do you have any idea how impossible it would be to regulate every little thing that might kill 36 kids a year? It would cost more money than the USA has. This is hardly right wing.  I'm a full blown socialist. I think that society's resources need to be used intelligently though. 36 is basically nothing, it's too small a problem to hit with a massive global policy fix. More kids will drown in the bathtub in a year. How do you plan to regulate that? How much would you consider too much to spend to save 36 kids? Do you have a limit? Would it be worth 1 trillion dollars? If not, then you too agree there's a limit. Then take into account that that dollar spent on this can't be spent on something else, and if it's a trillion that's basically food stamps, social security, the EPA, the FDA, and everything else that is good and proper for government to handle. Why do you think liberals are so against the bloated defense budget? It's because that money could be spent on something else, like socialized medicine. Money isn't some infinite resource. When you spend it on one thing you can't spend it on something else that may be saving thousands or millions of lives. Not 36. You're examining this question in total isolation to make us look bad, like it's a binary choice between save the kids and don't save the kids. That isn't how it works. This law is feel-good claptrap that distracts from those problems that the finite resources that should be directed towards that impact far more people. You say I don't care about 36 kids? I ask you why you don't care about the millions of people in the Caribbean affected by global warming and how this legislation distracts from Democrats fighting for real environmental change and reduce wasteful government spending to justifiably spend more on that issue. You know how many kids will  die from the effects of global climate change? Or how about put that money into the FDA, you know how many kids are saved by the FDA's regulations? Do you not care about them? Ok...you sound pretty worked up.

1. No one is saying we should remove airbags and/or seat belts. So, I'm not sure what you're getting at or who said that. I sure as hell did not.

2. Its not analogous in my book. If it is to you, then so be it. The way I see it seatbelts and air bags were made mandatory in order to save lives from shitty drivers (as well as your own shitty driving). That is their purpose by design. These alarms are not saving lives from bad parents. Its reminding the parents that they have children. Who the fuck seriously needs that reminder? They are keeping the lowest common denominator from being an abusive criminal deadbeat parent, for just as long as they are in the car. Once that child is out of the car, the parent simply resumes being a shitty parent. Thus the alarm probably doesn't even fulfill that job of saving the child's life. This alarm is maybe analogous to the alarm that beeps when you don't click you seatbelt, but that's a stretch too.

3. It sounds like you have a very dark opinion of what you think Bill Maher is actually like and believes. Do you have any evidence of him wanting dead babies in hot cars? I mean, are you serious? Sounds like you took one of his jokes about not liking kids to an unreasonable conclusion. I seriously doubt Maher is really concerned with the couple hundred dollars the sensor would cost. I think its more about the government stepping in to save the stupidest among us. Who forgets their kids in a car? Shitty parents. The kind that shouldn't have kids to begin with. &gt;No one is saying we should remove airbags and/or seat belts.

Nor am I saying anyone else was saying that. That's kind of the point: you should be in favor of sensors for the same reasons you are in favor of seatbelts and airbags.

&gt;So, I'm not sure what you're getting at or who said that. I sure as hell did not.

I don't know why you aren't following that I wasn't saying anyone said that. I was making a fairly simple point.

&gt;Its not analogous in my book. If it is to you, then so be it. 

Emptiness

&gt;The way I see it seatbelts and air bags were made mandatory in order to save lives from shitty drivers (as well as your own shitty driving). That is their purpose by design.

Right they are in many cases saving you from yourself. This cuts directly against Bill's point in a fairly straightforward way, seeing as he (while painting himself relevantly as a libertarian) bases his dispute with sensors on the government forcing you to save you from yourself at the expense of the consumer writ large.

&gt;These alarms are not saving lives from bad parents.

If you're saying that the difference hinges on bad parents vs. bad drivers, I'm not seeing why that is a relevant principle.

&gt;Who the fuck seriously needs that reminder? 

Some people, demonstrably. You sound pretty worked up about this.

&gt;They are keeping the lowest common denominator from being an abusive criminal deadbeat parent, for just as long as they are in the car. Once that child is out of the car, the parent simply resumes being a shitty parent. Thus the alarm probably doesn't even fulfill that job of saving the child's life.

This is pretty sketchy reasoning to confidently conclude that they would die anyway, and it is once again analogous to seatbelts: the seatbelt doesn't stop you from continuing to be a bad driver, but it would be silly to oppose them on this basis.

&gt;It sounds like you have a very dark opinion of what you think Bill Maher is actually like and believes.

I'm interested to see why you would say that.

&gt;Do you have any evidence of him wanting dead babies in hot cars? I mean, are you serious?

I didn't say anything about him wanting dead babies in hot cars you nitwit. You are incredibly touchy and bad at reading the actual things I'm saying.

&gt;Sounds like you took one of his jokes about not liking kids to an unreasonable conclusion. 

Oh the irony. 

&gt; I seriously doubt Maher is really concerned with the couple hundred dollars the sensor would cost. 

This, again, is part of my point. He should not care about the money, and yet his argument against them is specifically based on needing to pay more: if it were free, he would not have any opposition at all.

&gt;I think its more about the government stepping in to save the stupidest among us.

When it's free, it is obvious that the government *should* step in and save people, regardless of their stupidity.

&gt;Who forgets their kids in a car? Shitty parents. The kind that shouldn't have kids to begin with.

Yet you are taking it out against the *baby* when you oppose things that save them. Judge the parents all you want, but your moral outrage against the shitty parents is being wielded to stop regulations that help save the babies *from* the parents.&gt; Do you have any idea how impossible it would be to regulate every little thing that might kill 36 kids a year?

Please enlighten me. 

How many things do actually kill 36 kids per year, that haven't been regulated? 

&gt;It would cost more money than the USA has.

Oh okay, good guess.

&gt;More kids will drown in the bathtub in a year. How do you plan to regulate that?

I don't know? So your counter is "how come you can't solve every problem"? &gt; Then take into account that that dollar spent on this can't be spent on something else

Lol worrying about "that dollar" in a fractional reserve banking system. lolol

&gt;More kids will drown in the bathtub in a year. How do you plan to regulate that?

lmao

Saving the whole thing for copypasta later on.

Do you not care about them? -/u/Zauberer-IMDB Except for the one typo in that one sentence in the middle, that's economics 101. No, because you stupidly conflate money with resources. You treat them as if they are interchangeable and they are not. You should really read an introductory econ textbook though, it might help you out.Money is inextricably linked to resources. Resources and money are limited. He's right.go to your roomSnowflakes of every age need to get over themselves. The world does not owe them anything.I don't agree he's acting like any wealthy and privledged person does and there's nothing wrong with it. Most of them were deeply confused before Bill sits down.He's a talented performance artist. Shtick is shtick I don't think it matters what label you put on him or what he's selling. The important thing lies in the delivery. Then the reward. Bill has lots of wealth and resources so I'm certain that the women that chase him look very impressive. He can afford it. You won't find one sloppy, dumb, obese person in his type of black book. 

Obesity's not attractive regardless of how strong a collective media blitz tries to prove that it is. Your feelings don't change reality.  Why is this meschugena on the show bashing poor Bernie.Resources are limited. Money is not. What do you think inflation is? 

You have an *extremely* limited understanding of economics, it seems. It's not even a matter of "getting" the joke. I think the audience simply doesn't find a lot of his jokes to be funny. Myself included.

EDIT: Typos.What do you think inflation is? It's precisely because money isn't infinite more cash printed reduces value.I hope you're a teenager, because if you're an adult walking around, you have little to learn besides how hard life is.It's a good thing Bill Maher is on HBO, given how many people (like OP) are regularly triggered by his rants.

Other networks would crumble under the relentless torrent of tweets that would be sent their way - ultimately, Maher would be fired on any other network."crumble under the relentless torrent of tweets"

Wow, you certainly have a high opinion of your importance don'tcha? 

What makes you think HBO gives a single fuck about any number besides its number of subscribers? Do tweets equal subscribers' dollars?

Moron.&gt; My arguments are well-reasoned

http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/531/987/3b2.gifThat's exactly what I'm saying, dumb-dumb. HBO doesn't care about tweets.

You're not the sharpest tool in the shed, are you...Oh sorry I skim over dumbass posts for keywords. Shhh baby its okay....we all lose sometimes.This was a great interview. I didn't like their second one as much, though.&gt; Shhh baby **its** okayI love hearing Bill whip back at him on catholicism. Colbert comes off as condescending and Bill stuffs it back down his throat. Hilarious interview Funny how Bill was dead wrong about the whole "long election cycles will filter out the Trumps".  And I love the guy, but Christ the comment on microwaves being bad for you?!?  He can't resist indulging in the pseudo science quackery every now and then...
   But it was a hilarious interview, thanks for sharing.I’ve noticed something also. 

Sometimes a joke is so brutal the audience will go “uohhhh...” and Maher thinks they are booing him and he gets upset. He’ll even say stuff like, “You liberals are so touchy.”

It’s so childish.Have you been in a microwave?Colbert was doing a bit. He's very self-deprecating about his faith. He wanted Bill to spar back.This happened almost exactly 3 years ago and Mr. Affleck is in the news lately so I figured it might be worth revisiting. I still think Sam Harris and Bill are holding Muslims to an absurdly high standard. You could get over 50% of Americans, easily, to support nuking the Middle East. Man. Rewatching this, I just get so annoyed with Ben. Even if I agreed with his points (which I don’t), his conduct was terrible and childish.

That aside, this debate to me always boils down to a single question: is the problem with Islamic culture the extremists who supposedly pervert the religion to suit their desires, or is it perhaps the tenets of mainstream Islam itself? I’d argue that the fundamentalists are the more stark adherents to the core religious doctrines and the more reasonable mainstream Muslims simply are more separated from their religion...viewing it as more of a cultural identity than anything else. Which in the end illustrates to me that the core tenets of the faith are fundamentally toxic.

But even if we got to that point collectively, what’s the solution? It’s easy to point out a problem...it’s much harder to resolve a dilemma of this magnitude. People’s identities are so intertwined with their faith that telling them to stop believing is essentially telling them to commit suicide. All we really can do is continue to point out injustices, encourage education in those countries, and hope that the cultural tides adapt to the 21st century.I doubt that.https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/18/republican-voters-bomb-agrabah-disney-aladdin-donald-trumpI was AT this taping. You could hear a pin drop in the room (the actual sound stage and seating area is much smaller than it looks on tv).Thanks for refuting your own assertion?

A brief skim on that article says that 30% of GOP responders are in favor of *bombing* (read: Not nuking) an arbitrary city (in this case a fictional one because they don't know anything about the middle east) and only 19% of dems.

a) That's less than 50% of the us population

b) nuclear weapons are an entirely different proposition.

Good troll tho.Mr. Affleck? Don't you mean Buttman?The point is you're betting against the complicit idiocy of a population that elected a self-described molester who talked about nuclear proliferation like it was racking up a high score in Pacman, and said, literally he was was open to nuking Europe because it’s a “big place.” EUROPE. Never bet against Americans' total apathy to human suffering overseas. Unlikely, but even if you could, we wouldn't. Imagine the blow back by allied countries and enemies we would make. We are simply smarter than that. It's a complete non threat.  
  
Secondly, it's not a belief imposed by the state or any religion. The harmful tenets of Islam aren't unique to Islam but there's not much we can do about them. It's different to combat ideas with reason and logic than it is to combat religious doctrine with reason and logic. Many Muslims may not agree themselves with those ideas but it doesn't matter because it's God's will. We don't have to worry about Meinkempf because no one is commanded by divine power to believe in it.Is that you, Kellyanne Conway?http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/12/hillary-clinton/has-donald-trump-talked-about-using-nukes-against-/He didn't win the popular election and his support is dwindling. Man Affleck acted like such a douchebag and he came off not very bright at all.Well, I'll give you that statistic wouldn't be hard to get, yes, but the question is for what reason?

"We want to bomb those people, because they flew an airplane into our buildings."

OK, disagree or agree with that statement all you want ( I personally don't agree with it) but it is sure as hell a lot more sensible than:

"We want to kill those people because they drew a picture of Muhammad."

or 

"That woman deserves to be lashed, because she let herself get raped."
I agree.  The weird thing is I thought he'd always come off pretty well on the show before that night probably mostly because I usually agreed with him.  That night really shook me and made me rethink my beliefs.  It made me wonder if somehow I was no longer in lockstep with the Democratic party and I've heard others say the same thing.

While I'm sure it over exaggerates the point I've thought that night got people rethinking a lot of things.  You take this along with the Gamergate controversy that was gaining steam at the same time and you get many people rethinking their belief and moving to the right.  It set the stage for a mainstream backlash at PC culture that helped energize Trump's electorate.

If [Hillary takes Sam Harris' advice on her Middle East position](https://www.samharris.org/blog/item/what-hillary-clinton-should-say-about-islam-and-the-war-on-terror) she wins the election.  There's a willingness on the far left to set a low bar for Islam that wouldn't happen with any other religion or group.  

I still consider myself a liberal but when you see Affleck's unwillingness to even listen to the arguments you see the problem the the Dems need to address or they will continue to lose the moderate middle.Totally agreeLooks like noI don't see an airdate anywhere, and there's nothing posted to the Blog. 

I'll check again later, though. Sometimes the RT interns are rubbish.Apparently there is no show tonight but continues next week,  also only 2 shows left this year.Jesus. That's quite a winter break. Nope, back on the 20th.I always find it amazing that my university vacation days line up perfectly with him being on break. I mean, what are the odds?That is his schtick tho.Ya.. I don't get Bill Maher, he has to work like once or twice a week and gets paid millions of dollars. He's also high like 24/7, wouldn't he want to be doing the show with more frequency now that we have the Carrot as president?Holy shit, it's been 3 years already?If you enjoy your job, why would you put brakes on the amount of time you can put into it?Thanks for the tip! Sadly when I go back to the older episodes they say “Currently not available”; the newer ones have a yellow ‘Watch’ button in the same spot. 

(Does it show up for you?) You should write to HBO's corporate offices in NYC. They might send it to you. This isn't a recruitment center. 

Removed and locked. His Trump impression is awful though.James Carville has to be easily one of the best guest. he built the clinton machine, and saw its collapse. weird but amazing times we live inwhy the doubt? i voted for webb in the primary. there still conservative democrats that dont buy into identity politics10 EasternI find it kinda weird he has 'extra content' of like 3-5 mins as a separate podcast. I'm wondering if those are his warm up jokes or something. I think he never saw what Davis (corrected:D) does as a positive thing. He is so militarised against Trump voters etc he sees no point in extending any arm whatsoever.Janice Min low-key blaming the woman who Ben Affleck sexually assaulted. And by the way, Janice, there was more than one. I didn't buy her argument. Yes, we want to survive Trump, and the best way to do that will be to fight to win. There's no contradiction between objecting to what Trump's doing and being willing to do what it takes to win elections. &gt;&gt;Margaret Hoover: President of the American Unity Fund, a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the cause of freedom for LGBTQ Americans.

Shouldn't that position be held by, I dunno, an LGBTQ person?Margaret Hoover said one of the main reasons this show is getting harder to watch. Shit is getting too annoying to listen to for me now, almost a full year after the fucking election and finally someone makes this point as concise as she did..

Bill has to stop acting like he gets to choose the sides, even if it's his show, he's so delusional about what the actual average regular American people think.. he sounds more like a politician than most of the people he criticizes. 

Listen, we get it, you backed Hillary, you liked her, whatever dude. And you're mad about everything Republicans had done over the Obama administration and you want some weird ass personal revenge, yeah we get it. The fact of the matter is it wasn't just Trump supporters or Bernie supporters or Berniebros brats or whatever lame term you want to use on those people that didn't like her. Hillary wasn't liked in 2008, she wasn't liked in 2012 and she wasn't liked in 2016 by many people.. most importantly.. many INDEPENDENT people. Most independent people didn't give a fuck about Benghazi either, or about "Well Republicans did THIS.." and "Democrats said THAT.." most people don't give a fuck about any of those media talking points and Bill's almost unhealthy fixation on them is stupid. He's no different than whatever news network on the right or left you subscribe to by feeding into this obsession of black &amp; white right vs left bullshit going on right now. She put it perfectly when she said Bill is always focused on either trying to unify people or win these small ass pointless battles all the time that nobody actually cares about outside of CNN and FOX talking panels.. you cannot play both sides.

Most American people care about what is best for the individual American person, themselves, plain and simple. The media (on both sides, this is a global issue as well) nowadays capitalizes on inciting people and people often become delusional in this incitement which is how we're seeing populist candidates like Trump rise.. but Maher isn't helping by doing this stupid shit where he pretends everybody who isn't with Trump needs to be a hardline party Democrat.. in fact that's part of the problem.. it really IS the problem.. it's no different than Trump supporters who call anyone who disagrees with them a "Liberal" whatever that shit is supposed to mean. 

As Margaret said, and guests are starting to bring up more and more frequently.. there is a HUGE independent base in America. People are realizing fully now more than ever the bullshit of the 2 party system and nobody wants to hear some old guy bitch about how one day we all need to come together and the next "FUCK being the bigger person! They did this so now we're going to come back stronger! If you don't agree you're a whiny little bitch!" Some people just want shit to be ok again and don't want it to constantly be battle after battle, especially small little personal battles like the one's Bill picks (i.e. getting back at Republicans for some media tirade they had a couple years back.. who fucking cares? People in PR and CA are dying and WW3 could be on the brink of starting) 

Guests are going to keep checking him if he continues on with this bullshit, I can guarantee, cause you can see his reaction when he got checked by Margaret and he knew he was caught up. 

Get over the fact not everybody is a hardline Democrat, or a "Libertarian", or whatever stupid position you want to take that day. To quote that one news clip with the dude going off when are you going to stop acting like a politician and start being an American. It's not all black and white. If you're gonna have a sword at least be ready to fall on it and not move it and blame it on the other side whenever it comes time to own up to your bullshit, believe it or not it's a country behind all these politics regardless of what "side" you think you're on and we all live in it not just you Bill.Daryl is showing us a better part of humanity. It is so easy to just write people off as idiots, believe they will never change and then make them the enemy. Here you have a man going to the Klan members and changing their minds. 

I think there are probably some "lost causes" out there who will never change but many who will. This was an opportunity for Bill to use on how we can change the nation in a positive way. Missed opportunityHe probably spoke a bit too fast for an American audience who are not accustomed to listening to his British accent.

Personally, I thought he delivered the kind of talking points that Maher himself usually do, but in a more amusing and succinct manner.He has had some so so episodes and some really good ones.  he is doing fine.  I would like more discussion time.I see. Thanks for telling me that. 

Regardless, I definitely enjoyed that episode. Maybe, but its not unprecedented for the last guest to take up most of the time. He has extended this privilege to many others who dont hold a candle to him.Ill go further than that: Daryl is showing the only viable way to go forward. It is easy to see others as enemies but the truth is the only enemy is the communication breakdown
He had the ultra christian guy and Leah Remini do solo interviews. Why not do it like that? Daryl has many eyeopeners to share.You seriously believe Hillary Clinton of all people needed a smear campaign? Losing the primary in 2008 and not even being considered hardly over Barack in 2012 wasn't enough? Losing the progressive end of the party for giving Bernie the shaft wasn't enough? Decades of flip flopping on policy, which is something any independent voter is going to see a sign of unreliability wasn't enough? Decades of piss poor community interaction with minorities from both her and her husband weren't enough? Being "shady" and "corrupt" in a time where literally all you had to do was try to cover those qualities a little more than she did but instead she chose to capitalize on her connections and interests in plain sight of the American people wasn't enough? Hillary didn't stand for anything during her time running. That has nothing to do with being out gamed, it has to do with her not playing the game at all. That's why she didn't win. It's time for people to accept that, regardless of where you lie politically. 

"As of late 2013" is an eternity in politics. EDIT: Sike. It does say she was the most popular U.S. politician at the time, misread. 

"Quinnipiac researchers found 68 percent of U.S. voters said they are “somewhat dissatisfied” or “very dissatisfied” with the state of the nation today." is a much more interesting piece of information from your link, and goes further to prove my point that people don't want to like or dislike Hillary anymore.. they want her to go the fuck away, as with as any of the clowns on the right who have over stayed their welcome on American's minds so that we can focus on bringing the country back together again and getting back to being a working country for both ends of the political spectrum. 

Democrats know damn well how to game the American people, they're just fucking bad at it. Refresh my comment, I apologize, I misread and was thinking they were taking about partisan polls 

Also — are you seriously asking me what can change in politics in a year and a half in America? Come on, lol. 

You’re telling me off one poll that Hillary Clinton should be President because at one time in 2013 that poll declared she was the most popular politician in the U.S.? Really? 

And before you link me to other polls saying the same thing, try getting your point across without a poll. What’s a legitimate reason the American people should care about Hillary Clinton anymore? Why should they have cared about her in the first place? Are we really still blaming the American people for this or can we look at the Democratic party FINALLY. Because the Republicans will continue to win if this culture of denial and “Everyone loves Hillary, what happened?” continues.Exactly. 

You can't just do shitty things and then say "Ok well, you pointing them out is pretty shitty!".. Uh.. yeah, sure, but so is actually doing shitty stuff.

American people realized that backwards rhetoric quickly, and when she was tripped up by it she had nothing to stand for when she got back up. 

You don't have to be a Democrat or Republican or "leftist" or "rightist" to appreciate integrity. And in the case of the last election, even fake integrity sells better than nothing at all. Other people foot the bill for your purity. Sorry, but you’re not going to convince me the GOP had some massive smear campaign that without would’ve landed them in 2nd place. Of all places, of course in the U.S. there is sniping across the aisle. As a candidate it is your responsibility to dodge those shots and emerge the better person. She did not. 

Hillary lost because she was a bad candidate. You can blame the GOP, Russia, etc. but the fact is that she had the upper hand over all of these factors, even as you’re trying to portray, the upper hand on history and U.S. politics, and she STILL lost to Donald J. Trump. There’s no excuse for this, no matter how much you want to believe whoever or whatever is responsible besides herself. 

John Kerry isn’t a villain to anyone I know, I’ve barely heard his name since the Obama administration. Even then he may have been a “polarizing figure” to some Republicans, but even most Republicans I know didn’t have a problem with him then or now.

Your talking points won’t work on me, I don’t watch FOX, CNN, MSNBC any of those. I form my own opinion like most Americans do — so again as an Independent who leans Libertarian more than anything, when will the Democratic party and Hillary take responsibility for their own inexcusable loss? Because until they do, they will lose and lose and lose. I’m reading everything you’re saying and it doesn’t make sense, lol.

You’re basically folding to make me happy and admitting she’s a bad candidate, but then saying it’s not her fault she’s a bad candidate.

No it is, Hillary Clinton was a shitty Democratic candidate who couldn’t win a Presidential election against Donald Trump.

Weathering political controversy and navigating through your opposition is part of being a politician and not only did she fail at that she now fails to own up to her lack of even trying. If she can’t “go there” or get through them “going there” then she was the weaker candidate. There’s nothing more to it than that. The Republicans don’t have some mind control ability, they utilized everything she and the Democrats could have but she didn’t. She didn’t stand for anything and rise up above criticisms, she let them hit and then blamed those around her for them. 

It’s nobody’s fault she was a bad candidate but herself. She got herself that loss, now she, and you or anyone else who can’t let it go needs to accept that so we can try to fix what’s happening in the NOW not last November. The Democrats will not be apart of this process if they continue to do exactly what you are doing and pretending the Republicans are the only people who did not like her or the politics she stood for.I am willing to assume that the person he is talking to votes Tory (conservative) based on his accent. Probably shouldn't do that but if thats true its interesting that Bill was invited there. They funded it, it didn't come *from* them. This has also [has been known for 5 months](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/10/qa-what-we-know-about-alleged-links-between-trump-and-russia).This is not the place for this. 

Removed and locked. Well to be fair to the administration, all the juvenile shenenigans are nothing more than a smokescreen. So are feuding and so called GOP wars that are meant to work as a distraction, keeping public's eye from the stuff that actually matters. Real work is being done behind the curtains. 

Just like Corker, Flake etc. acting all tough and serious in front of camera, but still voting along the party lines. https://theintercept.com/2017/10/24/after-day-of-feuding-jeff-flake-and-bob-corker-join-trump-to-upend-a-major-consumer-protection/that samatha bee thing was just complete cringe&gt; conservative's views of the Left being whiny children!

ADMIT IT KING PICKLE!One can only hope that Lord guy will be only a 1 on 1 interview before the panel. Just like Roger Stone was a few months ago.Don't be a jackass. It's one thing to call an idea a lost cause, and another to start going after a specific user. 

Comment removed, as is it's child. Interesting story. If true, it looks like DWS damn near destroyed the DNC, and Clinton ended up rescuing it. 

Doesn't seem illegal, or even unethical though, as even in that piece it doesn't say that Clinton was obstructing Sanders' campaign. More just trying to keep the DNC from destroying itself (again). &gt; This is what raises ethical questions.

Not as far as I can tell. Maybe moral questions, but not ethical. 

A private entity was drowning. Another private entity offered to rescue them. The rescuer requested basic controls to avoid having the previously drowning entity from repeating it's mistakes. 

Seems like simple business to me. Not faith, no. Clinton needed the campaigning resourses of the DNC. It's one thing to have a smattering of PACs throwing out ads, or volunteer groups canvassing, and another to have a dedicated national organization to help campaign. 

Even if Sanders had won, he'd then need the resources of the DNC to help him win the election. Had Clinton not stepped in and bailed them out, those resources might not have been there. 
I've never heard him speak tbh, I am glad I can see what he's like. Or the two (R) that condemned trump recently. Corker and that other guy.I've literally got a schema already from South Park so I don't know what to expect. Regardless of how one might consider them, that is the reality. The are private entities, not public. [What I think about when I think of Rob Reiner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9CYPey1C_w)&gt; You may be right, but, if one of the parties just said "we are ignoring primaries, and are just nominating who ever pays us the most money" (not saying that this is equivalent or comparable to what Hillary did), but if one of the parties just said, "we don't care what the voters say, we are nominating person X" would we really be saying "Well, they are a private organization, they can do what they want"?

Yes, we would. Parties are not required to have primaries. Primaries are a tactical research method, effectively. They want to win the election, so the hold tryouts to find the most likable candidate. They do not need to do this, but it is in their best interests to. 

&gt;I am not closed minded about this either, I have a lot of respect for the rights of a private organization, and they should be able to do what they want. But it sure doesn't seem to sit right, the idea that the political parties that control the rules for the debates and give themselves advantages are actually private organizations with no public over-site.

Then vote in third-party candidates at local and state levels, till they have enough power to make moves on Congress. The DNC and RNC have a system that works, and they're not going to change it, whether it sits right or not. 

&gt;I do think though, if we are willing to let political parties get away with "small" indiscretions that are questionable because we need to "respect that they are a private institution" then we have to defend their right to get away with egregious morally questionable tactics too for the same reason. And maybe that is it, if a political party wants to take steps to shut out voters, and move to a "take what we give you" model, maybe we just need to let that play out... doesn't "feel" right though.

That argument doesn't make sense. As private entities, they can have their own views on anything they like. Voters then pick the person they like most, and *then* that person can actually do something about their views. Republicans want to disenfranchise voters, yes, but they were democratically voted in at the beginning. That's more or less literally what I said to myself when I saw this lineup.  So many recycled guests lately - are they running out of people willing to come on the show?Hopefully only to say they weren't rigged. Thats interesting. if you enjoy disagreeing with facts may I suggest /r/the_donald? It will take some getting used to but you will fit right in!It seems to me that most "serious" politicians rarely, if ever go on Real Time.  Those who do come usually seem like the worst attention whores and blowhards of DC...It's not a fact any more than it's a fact that I'm the Queen of England. 

The DNC is a private party, and can run primaries as they see fit. It is a private party and thus no legal ramifications should arise yet, DNC officials reassured voters multiple times that the primaries were fair. It is a major dishonesty issue. 

You might be surprised but if a party cant be trusted to run primaries, people might not trust them to run a country.&gt; It is a major dishonesty issue.

Maybe so, but not illegal or really unethical. Maybe immoral, but morals are what we apply to ourselves, not private political organizations. It is the definition of unethical. Going against the public affirmed covenant is enough to take other companies down, so why not this private company? People donated tons of money in the campaigns, should they knew that the primary was only for show, they could have made better use of their money. This is the DNC not respecting the dollars of their supposed constituentsHe tends to surprise positively every time Im close to give up on him so who knowsThey didn't go against anything. Both candidates were offered the same deal, and Sanders turned it down. what? when was sanders offered the control of DNC in exchange of money? Do you just throw words together hoping they make an argument?&gt; Kingston

Hey, Jack Kingston is actually fun to have on, at least. He and Bill get along really well. No really. He just has a different view on things. Some I'd argue are objectively wrong, but at least he's open to engaging in discussion. And he's good fun. Unethical - lacking moral principles; unwilling to adhere to proper rules of conduct.

Immoral - violating moral principles; not conforming to the patterns of conduct usually accepted or established as consistent with principles of personal and social ethics.There is a definition that actually differentiates between the two sharply but not this one.The DNC is in charge of the primaries. A contract in 2015 (before HRC or anyone else announced their candidacy) placed DNC's day to day strategic and financing decisions to HRC's headquarters in Brooklyn in exchange for funding which they needed like crazy because Obama and DWS dropped the ball concerning DNC's funding. 




So HRC's headquarters where the only ones responsible for organising an election that they were taking part in. Does this include the Russia investigation, or just some parts of 2016?You dont fix things by covering them, only discussion fixes fracturesNo namecalling please. We have a rule about civility here.there are far more fucking important things to be looking at. HRC isn't the fucking POTUS who has colluded with Russia for one.Theres more important stuff to talk about right now. I think the biggest reason Dems lost is that Hillary rigged the nomination process. She should've never won the nomination process, nominating a candidate that had no appeal to voters is why Dems lost. Look at Donna Brazile, she just came out and said that in effect, Hillary had puppet strings on the DNC, because she and her husband were essentially bankrolling the DNC, because the DNC was in effect broke.Or followed the directive of Russian Trolls: "Save Time, Skip the line, text xyz to vote for Clinton/Kaine". &lt;-- came out that this happened in the Senate Intelligence hearings this week.[Came out of this weeks Senate Intelligence Hearing](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oii8xkze7Bo).Ya and said: "I am taking a stand, so effective immediately, I'm quitting, Goodbye".Good god. Fling poo elsewhere. 

This is a subreddit focused on Bill, RT, PI, his standup and his appearances. Not what you think might happen next. 

Removed and locked. See this? This is more appropriate. 

You're still shooting at ghosts, though. &gt;Still, it clearly allowed the Clinton campaign to influence DNC decisions made during an active primary, even if intended for preparations later.

Read your own first article FFSShould we take Hillary's word for it? 
We do have decisions evidently made to help HRC and we have documentation that her campaigned was more than involved with the DNC. This is a smoking gun.Is Elizabeth Warren a Trump surrogate looking to keep the left fighting amongst themselves? Because she sure thinks this was riggedLol, the DNC is purging the progressives NOW and nothing prevents them from rigging elections again. the allegations are important because they involve the future. How was bernie offered the same deal, bernie was not a nominee when this deal was struck, he announced laterDoing joint fundraising is different from having control over the DNC. Everyone knew HRC victory fund existed, that is not the problem, what was new was the notion that HRC had control over the DNC. Please stop trying to spin this.Okay trump. One is president of the USA the other is some civilian. Yes fuck you. Why are you so hung up on the DNC? A rapist sexual predator is in charge of your country who was colluded with Russia. 

Oh and the "I'm not a trumpist" is basically I'm not racist butLook who the cat dragged in."Papadopoulos says he told Trump about Russia meetings."  Wait, really?!?from CNN

&gt;the document does not give the Clinton campaign outright authority to make staffing decisions for the DNC, but it does give the Clinton campaign a say in who the DNC considers for positions like communications director and senior staff in communications and technology and research departments.

That looks like its before the GE.I don't think he's blind to it. But at some point you have to acknowledge that Bernie just didn't have the votes to become the nominee. It's a fucked up way of choosing candidates &amp; the DNC need to answer for their part in it, but infighting only strengthens Trump's base. There's no 'good' time for THAT conversation to be had, but there will be 'better' times ahead &amp; it WILL be had, but right now, we just need to focus on the bigger danger.
ah whataboutism at its finest my friend.We are going in circles. If you are an HRC fan boy-girl and dont want to understand, I cant help youAre you an idiot? Everything mentioned in the memo shows CLEARLY that the impartiality was compromised, claiming that it shall not be construed to violate the DNC's role does not make up for that fact....Im not the one hurling insults to strangers buddy, id say im the stable one here. Believe what you want. You continue believing that 6 debates on crapnights had nothing to do with the fact that the DNC chair who later became fucking head of Clintons campaign was colluding with her.  


Whatever you say, I got Elizabeth Warren on my side of the argument. Who do you have? No Doubt. He will try to weasel his way out of any and all conversations criticizing the Democratic Establishment. fucking joy reid.... lmaodissent of the DNC isnt trolling lol&gt; like DWS damn near destroyed the DNC, and Clinton ended up rescuing it.

more like she purposely ran it into the ground so the DNC was force to bend their knee for hillary. &gt; A rapist sexual predator is in charge of your country

Bill Clinton isn't president anymore m8
okay bigot bill...i am a bing kinda guyDude you are such a shill 
&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_debates_and_forums,_2008

Over 20 debates almost double the debates and forums in 2008. I am done debating this, even this comment section had more debates than the Democrats in 2016. You like Hillary, have at it. See you 2020.Yes trump is who is also a sexual predator well done, try not to think to hard next timelive your life DNC toolGotta say, I admire your persistence. hahaha, always aiming for the last word aint ya?Whatever buddy.OK he mentioned the rigging. Not in an episode but still, I am satisfiedMaher has said many times on the show the primaries werent rigged, and they wereThis would be great if Lord also acknowledged that Trump himself has called for the silencing of media that is critical of him. Seems pretty relevant to the point he is making.Good line up I think. I like Sarah and Michael. What are the odds that Bill ACTUALLY brings up the DNC corruption that Donna finally admitted to in her new book? 

With Bill constantly bashing progressives, maybe now he should get why we are so angry.Tried to restrict access to the DNC voter database that both campaigns contributed to prior to the major Rhode Island election (Only backed down via court order). Gave Hillary preference over going first or last at debates. Tried to limit the amount of debates because of Hillary being a bad public speaker. The DNC also downplayed her and Bill's private speaking events at all these banks and pharmaceutical cronies that largely contributed to the financial crisis and opioid epidemic. Tried to make Bernie voters look violent by editing protests and making outrageous baseless claims like Bernie supporters threw chairs at a protest in Nevada.

So a TLDR outline would be: 

Restricted campaign database access prior to a major election.
Gave Hillary preference over going first or last at debates (Stacking the deck).
Downplayed taking money from banks and pharmaceutical companies in the midst of several crisises.
Launched baseless character attacks trying to alienate outreach to voters by making Bernie supporters look violent.Wow, talk about choosing battles as Bill likes to say. Getting the one person who's been responsible for disrupting DNC politics lately with all her alleged allegations and providing GOP with some talking points. Hope she admits she did wrong and distances herself from all those conspiracies she at least partially helped to bring to life lately.The DNC violated their contract with the Bernie Campaign i.e. "10 days notice for cutting database access to the campaign" and made that false accusation "That they attempted to hack the Hillary Camp and access data collected by the other side". After an independent audit which was agreed to by the DNC and the Sanders Camp, it was found that accusation was hot air and a purposeful attempt sabotage (among many attempts) Bernie Sanders [(Et al, The Washington Post, Dec 19th 2015)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sanders-threatens-to-sue-dnc-if-access-to-voter-list-isnt-restored/2015/12/18/fa8d6df8-a5a2-11e5-ad3f-991ce3374e23_story.html). " A copy of the lawsuit filed with a federal court in Washington reveals that the agreement to use a shared computer system for voter registration and supporter data included a provision for a 10-day notice period for any changes to access" [(Et al, TheGuardian, December 19th 2015)](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/18/bernie-sanders-set-to-sue-democratic-national-committee-over-data-access). https://www.reddit.com/r/Maher/comments/7b26sp/bill_maher_on_twitter_bernie_ppl_are_rightly/We're not interested in your shenanigans here.

Comment removed and user banned. Additionally, we should make it clear that it isn't as simple as OP sort of implies. 

When you apply for a handgun license, you *must* have solid references (generally a 'respected' professional, like a police officer, lawyer, doctor, etc). And, if the RCMP (our national police force) feel like it, they can call anybody they like to check up on your application. 

For example, I was called by the RCMP for a friend's gun license because her reference (her boss at the time) mentioned that I was a good friend of hers. And this was a license to be able to work in props for a film set, not for ranges or hunting. &gt; It's just poorly moderated.

Comment removed, as are the children from here. &gt; He barely even mentioned Bernie at that time

What? Bernie was a frequent guest around that time, it went far beyond mentioning him. Im sorry but this is some straight up revisionism.

He also endorsed Bernie first, only moving to Clinton after she'd won the primary. Yes, it's not gender specific, a woman would need to go through the same checks[From an episode of Real Time 7 months ago](http://i.imgur.com/j7K7T5k.png)Probably nothing illegal here but sure does destroy a lot of narratives from the Trump Admin. and from Wikileaks as well. If this is getting revealed in the media, I wonder what Mueller has.It was a good episode IMO. How would intel committee Dems know what Mueller has? They are seperate investigations. And previous leaks have never stopped new evidence from flowing but it will now why exactly?

edit: spellingWhy is a Politician's sex life any of our business?  I can see if that involves harm to someone it would be (sexual assault, pedo, ect).

None of our fucking business.&gt; They forget it wasn’t until his THIRD scandal that they finally did away with him.

He was forced to resign from Congress initially and then when he sought elected office again 2 years later he received only 4.9% of the vote in a *Democratic* primary for NYC Mayor. Uh, him making an anti-PC joke is his being anti-PC.  It offended some people, sure.  But everything offends someone.  Bill used to rip on celebrities for apologizing for wearing anti-PC Halloween costumes.  Now he's apologizing for making an anti-PC joke (inb4 "herr derr racism!"
And yes, he wants Dems to be a tougher political party, and he used Anthony Weiner as the poster boy for this toughness.  But now that it's Roy Moore, all of a sudden such behavior is despicable and he belongs in jail.
You can't be serious with post, can you?Don't be such a jackass. Grow up, both of you. 

Comment removed, as are it's children. *Looks at flair, looks back at this comment*

Lol. 

Regardless, you're clearly not interested in being civilized. Enjoy your 7 day ban. Quite the fandrone we got here.?
Bill Maher:  We need a tougher Democratic party with bad boys like Anthony Weiner (a guy who was involved in sexual activity with underage girls)!
Bill Maher:  The Republicans are nominating somebody who was involved with sexual activity with underage girls, how dare they!
It's you who doesn't see the difference.  You're either a Maher fanboy or you're living in a weird bubble.Jesus Christ, you're slow.  Based on that logic Moore should be a hero to Maher because he's being a "bad boy" and not giving in to the media/establishments demands that he drop out of the race.  You're such a snowflake that you can't fathom an opposing view.Wow, you're so narrow in your thinking.  Of course he didn't support Weiner because he was a sexual predator.  But he still put a SEXUAL PREDATOR on the list of "bad boy" liberals whom the Democratic party should follow.  Yet when Roy Moore does such a thing, Moore is not on the list of "bad boy" conservatives, he deserves to be in jail.Ok, I don't get it.  Explain to me what you get, but I don't.  I await your silence.I've seen him.  Still doesn't explain what I'm not getting.  Again, explain to me what I'm not getting when Maher is ok with 1 pedo (who is a Democrat) but wants to put another pedo in jail (who is a Republican).No answer, huh?  Just put into words what I'm not getting.  If you can't explain it in a reddit post, then you obviously have no argument to make.I said that 17 times.  According to you I'm not getting something that you get.  What is it?It's totally relevant.  Nobody would know who Weiner is nationwide without his pedophilia scandal.  He wouldn't be saying "Democrats should be like Weiner" if he wasn't infamous for his scandals, because no one outside of NYC would know who he was talking about.

Again, what am I not getting?  You're still not offering anything to back up the claim that you're seeing something that I'm not.  It's sad at this point.This has run it's course. 

Thread locked. Seems relevant with the DNC getting a lot of discussion here recently.The accuser already accepted Franken's apology and has said that's all she wanted. 

Nice little 6 hour scandal, but it's already over and done with. So if Roy Moore offers an apology to his accusers and they accept it, that makes him totally fit to run for Senate?Apples and oranges. Classic whataboutism. 

Moore is a straight-up paedophile with a growing history of abuse of minors. 

Franken went over the line during a comedy skit once, and made a really stupid attempted joke on the airplane. It is. There'll probably be an ethics investigation, given Franken and Schumer's requests, but as far as the accuser is concerned, the matter is closed. This amount of verbal gymnastics...

None of Harvey Weinstein's victims were underage.  If he apologizes and they accept all is forgotten?  You can't be serious with post.Still apples and oranges. Still with the whataboutism. 

Weinstein was a serial offender who used his power to rape and terrorize numerous women. It's not comparable. &gt; Franken is a sex offender who used his power to rape a woman

This is sad, bro.  You're literally saying it's okay for Franken to conduct himself this way because he apologized and the woman accepted.  You're so blinded by your political beliefs that you're giving this guy a pass.  If this were a Republican Senator from Tennessee in this exact situation you would be throwing him under the bus.  You're pathetic.

You can misquote me if you'd like. Doesn't change facts. 

I didn't say it was okay. It's despicable. But he owned it, apologized, had his apology accepted, and is willing to undergo an investigation. Maybe I'm "pathetic," but I have this funny habit of not considering apples to be oranges. Apples are not oranges, even if they're both fruit. &gt;  But he owned it, apologized, had his apology accepted, and is willing to undergo an investigation.

So let me get this straight.  Anytime a Senator, Congressman, VP, or even President is accused of sexual misconduct, they merely have to "own it", apologize, get a an accepted apology in return and call for some "investigation" and they are off the hook?  Sweet Jesus.Is that what I said, or are you just going to keep making things up?

Did I say "anytime"? Did I say "off the hook"? No, I did not. 

Don't put words in people's mouths. It's unbecoming. You didn't say anytime, but you did say for this time, it's totally ok for Franken to get away with behavior because he apologized and is launching an investigation.  You're so sad, bro.  You're letting your liberalism blind  you to the fact that Franken is just as big of a piece of garbage as all the others but you're willing to let him weasel out of it without any repercussions because he has  a "D" next to his name.Did I say that "it's totally okay for Franken to get away with behaviour"? No, I did not. You're still just making things up to fit your narrative. 

It's also amusing that you just assume I'm a liberal.&gt; Nice little 6 hour scandal, but it's already over and done with. 

Just got home and it's still going strong.  Your radar is way off, just like your insane opinionsLooks like it's pretty much blown over now. There'll hopefully be an ethics investigation, but the scandal itself is pretty much done. 

Interesting how invested you are in this, and how personal you keep choosing to make it. Are you nuts?  It's still all over every news website/twitter/cable news, etc.  As long as Moore is still running for Senator, Franken's name will come up as well.

Are you just trolling at this point?I mean, not really. Do we have to go over how apples and oranges are different again? One is not the same as the other. 

And me? Trolling? Pfft.You're the only person on reddit calling them apples and oranges.  If anyone Franken's is worse because there photographic evidence.  Moore has so far admitted to nothing.

And yeah, you are trolling because you think this huge story ended hours ago when it's still going strong (and will continue to for at least a few weeks).Well, I mean, me and simple logic. Hell, you can see a shadow under Franken's hands in the photo, so it's clear he isn't even touching her at that time. One is not the same as the other, therefore. 

But no matter. It's clear you've no interest in even discussing the matter, but rather prefer to push a specific narrative. So y'all have a good night now. &gt; Hell, you can see a shadow under Franken's hands in the photo, so it's clear he isn't even touching her at that time. One is not the same as the other, therefore. 

If he did nothing wrong, why did he apologize?  You're playing the "herr derr it looks like he's just hovering over her breasts while she sleeps" excuse I've heard from 3 insane sources online.  You being one of them.

&gt;. It's clear you've no interest in even discussing the matter, but rather prefer to push a specific narrative. 

You're the one who doesn't have interest in discussing anything.  You instantly brushed this story off as a dead issue that wasn't a big deal to begin with.  Sad.  Pathetic.  you.[not looking good](https://i.redd.it/33antr6p3eyz.jpg)he found out dropping out of the DNC chair for  someone that will rig your running mate's primary doesn't make you VP it'll be interesting to see what lie she pulls out of her gaped vag on why her show got cancelled. Whats a TLDR on why she is a bad guest?Nope, that's not the one :/ it's really frustrating me that I can't find the one I'm looking for.

It's the one where he shows footage of Bob Dole saying "stop lying about my record" and he screams in shock sarcastically.So shes like a liberal version of Milo Yiannopoulos?It says 10pm on twitter. What time zone is that, how long do i have to stay up in the UK?Eastern. 45 minutes from now.sick, thanks my man  what you're describing is essentially the antithesis to the constitutions purpose. its designed to limit government power. not only do you want to give the state way more power over the individual, but you also want to disarm the people. 

dumb.the people in the middle east are giving the biggest army a run for their money. a guerrilla warfare tactic employed by people who understand their turf has the advantage. and besides, do you think the army would be busting down doors so quickly if they thought there could be a guy with a gun back there? 

disarming the american people is just about the stupidest thing i can think of and i frankly think its short sighted and shows tremendous weakness and submissiveness to voluntarily say 'disarm me'. 

and as for your other points, you're talking about a massive government. that is not what our constitution is supposed to be about, don't you understand that what you're describing is incompatible with liberty?

what gives you the right to healthcare? healthcare needs to be administered by someone, so what gives you the right to their labor?im not a child. we're supposed to be taxed at a bear minimum for defense and let the free market work as it is the most efficient at allocating the highest quality resources to the most people through competition and incentives.

there is no incentive for a public healthcare system to innovate or lower prices as there is no competition. 

i dont care what other countries do, they don't have their free speech and self defense rights protected either, but you've already said you would go that route so its no surprise. 

you're talking about trillions of dollars.you literally dont. you can't arm yourself, you can be punished for saying words the state doesn't like, you are forced to pay into programs even if you do not wish.

explain to me what liberty you have? welfare? that's slavery dawgyah so you don't have true liberty. its okay, you're like a pet, the state takes care of you. some people like that.&gt; And superdelegates are justified with the same reasoning, to make sure people don't get too worked up and do something crazy.

I know we're talking about the Democratic party here, but still, that reasoning took a pretty nasty beating last year...how's that?i agree. although id say the only function of the nation state is to protect from invaders. these things cost so much money because the government made it mandatory for insurance companies to cover all kinds of conditions, among other reasons.

our system is a mess for one reason: government. and you think they're not going to give it to their pharma friends? what on earth makes you think that our government can be trusted to do this. 

do you not understand that centralization is BAD. we need competition.i am fully aware of the us's problems and what im trying to tell you is its because we have a LACK of competition right now. 

you think having even LESS competition and forcing the entire country to buy the same thing will be good. 

you also think that our corrupt broken stupid government should be trusted to seize trillions of dollars to fund this and then CONTROL OUR HEALTH. 

i reject every single one of these premises. Of course we COULD pay for it and make it cheaper. The problem is you think seizing money and growing government and having a monopoly for 320 million people is a good idea. In a system that they have no say over. I want diversity. I want competition. That's the only proven way to lower costs and increase value. Yes the us is the only country where our right to free speech is enshrined and shall not be infringed. Prove me wrong, I'd love to know where else this exists. 

I want competiton in all fields, insurance companies, hospitals, doctors - everything. That's how you lower prices and provide the highest quality goods to the most people. 

Right now our government rules prevent competition and create this perfect storm of shit system. I wouldn't vote for it, but you'd still take my money with force and tax. Don't you get that? You think your stupid vote has any say on anything? When's the last time your vote fixed a problem or ended corruption. Embarrassing really. 

I want diversity because me and you want different things. 

Those systems in other countries are ticking time bombs like social security here. They will not last. Section 1 of the charter permits them to enact laws that restrict that freedom. 

Canada does NOT have free speech rights. Yes you can. The fire example is only applicable if you incite a riot. It's not saying fire. It's inciting a riot. 

And I'm pretty sure I could go say that foul stuff to a black person. It's not illegal to speak. in america we're a republic so it doesnt really work like that. and even if it did, that doesnt matter to me - i still would say it should be as small as possible and involved in as little as possible. 

government is force and violence. that's it. it should be used as little as possible. some of those i can not defend. but in canada there's hate speech laws. you can keep em.Did you download from iTunes or from libsynpro via the XML page? (the latter no longer exists it seems)Which URL are you using? It cannot be the one I am using because it does not even exist (see my edited OP).


Fantastic! Thanks!

The URL pointed to by the old HBO xml file is without the rss suffix. Perhaps someone should be notified?
Rewatching it she honestly reminds me of Kim Kardashin.I've had enough of you. You are no longer welcome here. 

Comment removed, as are several of it's children. OP has gone off the deep end. 

Post locked. Right, but nobody laughed and it got awkward. It sort of seemed like she was serious, which really threw me off.Thank you.Innocent until proven guilty is a legal standard, not the scientifically determined best method for determining the truth of something. I thought "power bottoms" was the funniest thing I've ever heard her say. Maybe we have such ingrained biases we'll never give women the same benefit of the doubt we give men. Heck, Hillary losing to Trump certainly appears to be the result of such implicit biases. And if so, "let the best person win, regardless of gender" may be an inadequate strategy for addressing the flaws in our politics. Al Franken didn't molest a child. He is demonstrably not as bad as Roy Moore.I honestly want to see Russel Brand on the program again. He was hilarious. [When he was talking about honey bees](https://youtu.be/8NaJdHZSPqM?t=6m33s) and he was like strung out, I was lmfao. [I also loved how he made Bill stfu about his Hillary bs](https://youtu.be/pkFJvHepN2g?t=2m56s).That line in his Overtime segment, about the sex party &amp; the hot tub looking like Oatmeal...fucking slayed me. I honestlybelieve I have never laughed more at any line on Real Time.[Exact moment of that happening](https://youtu.be/epAOsfBK3zo?t=7m29s).You've mistaken me for someone who defends other people's straw man version of my views. It's a good thing that Al Franken story died.   Oh wait...This article is from yesterday (6th), and is the specific article Sen. Franken listed in his tweet denying the resignation decision. 

~~The senator is planning to make an announcement today, but this is an unsubstantiated report at this time. Just FYI.~~ 

[Per NPR](https://www.npr.org/2017/12/07/568909860/sen-al-franken-to-make-announcement-amid-calls-for-him-to-resign), Sen. Franken has now announced that he will resign. h/t /u/Da_Funk.Excellent, thank you. Hadn't seen this pop up yet. I'll add it to my stickied comment. You really nailed this story, hankjmoody.  Here are some quotes from you when we argued about this last month:
"The accuser already accepted Franken's apology and has said that's all she wanted.
Nice little 6 hour scandal, but it's already over and done with."
"Looks like it's pretty much blown over now. There'll hopefully be an ethics investigation, but the scandal itself is pretty much done. "
I wonder if you're still in denial.
why does this sub attract t_D users too? It's confusing.&gt; Maybe it's just me, but I find it embarrassing that Bill and his entire dumb*ass audience laughed their butts of when Ann Coulter said Trump was gonna win.

Did Bill really laugh? Care to share the clip? He sure didn't laugh at Michael Moore when Moore said the exact same thing.

edit: Found [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0fA7inVhTs) but maybe you're talking about a more recent appearance. Bill doesn't laugh in this one.

&gt;He should at least swallowed his pride and invited her back on..

Is it confirmed that he didn't? Could be scheduling conflicts or any number of things. She's a 12 time guest so it's not like he's shy about having her on.I think you replied to the wrong person. Just FYI. Yeah, no. This kind of nonsense isn't welcome here. 

Comment removed. Yes. I've watched them all. Chapelle is awesome... But Trump drops a load of crazy daily.Jan 19th

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Real_Time_with_Bill_Maher_episodes#Season_16_(2018)Same with Jason Miller. Really deluded and backwards people that are given to much air time to spread their bile.Ya... : / , as much as I don't like his Hillary coddling; I miss his criticism of Trump and his hilarious sketches. My favorite is the outline of suspects. "The crime begins with fat donny".I meant partisan. In fairness I wrote it while drunk shouting at my stream of cnn while he said some drivel. Apologies. Yeah, that asshole is a gleeful liar who almost can't contain his joy when he utters complete nonsense Everybody hates these pointless paid partisan talking heads. However, Real Time isn't really a news show, so it's understandable people like him are booked to keep the audience entertained. But... the real question here should be is this, why CNN keeps giving him and the rest of the MAGA cultists and reality deniers so much of air time. Same with Don Lemon's show. It really should have gone better after the election, but it sadly has not.Well, technically it's those two new ones that were released on Dec 31. And... only one of them is political, the second is pretty much about the harrasment culture. Which makes me think both are indeed political after all ;) Considering T_D's PP tape and the locker room talk on the BB's bus.Damn, that's a weird, but a good one. A joke that rendered Al Franken irrelevant and made him go away. That's crazy. I hope Billlll doesn't get any backlash over this. Which I'm sure he will and that will in itself make Bill go on rant over PC culture and how dems need to fight the real enemy.Gaslighting from one side and endless stream of jokes from the other. Just like somebody said today, at first it was resistance, then marches, then hats, then tweets, and now people are fed up with it already.I can't wait for Maher to decry Trumps "shithole" comment, and then go on a 5 minute rant about how liberals and college students are "too PC"You can be anti-pc and think that the president shouldn't say retarded things that hurt our standing in the world. Not really a contradiction in my opinion. Huh?  Anytime a politician says something anti-PC, the PC Police will label it as "retarded" or some other attack.  Maher claiming to be some anti-PC warrior whilst ripping on Trump for saying anti-PC things is insane.  There's a reason why this is one of the most unpopulated subreddits around.You can be anti PC and still understand there are lines you shouldn't cross in all or certain settings. It isn't a license to be an asshole without any consequences. I'm curious if there's anything you think crosses the line? 

If someone approaches a person leaving the funeral of a loved one and laughs in their face and says "I'm glad your loved one died" would being offended be justified or would that be just being PC?

edit: I also highly doubt the PC police use the word retarded.How is saying you're glad someone died at a political?  There's negative statements and then there's anti-PC statements.  Maher had said numerous times that there are "protected species" when it comes to PC culture.  Yet he participates in this rule just as much as the people he rails against.
" I'm curious if there's anything you think crosses the line? "
I'm all for anything when it comes to jokes and comedy.  But I guess if I had to choose a few things:
I guess saying nasty things about the Holocaust?  Using the N-word in a negative way.&gt;How is saying you're glad someone died at a political?

Fair point, bad example.

&gt;Yet he participates in this rule just as much as the people he rails against.

Elaborate please.

&gt;I'm all for anything when it comes to jokes and comedy.

I agree but the original topic you introduced was Trump's statement so I figured we were talking outside of comedy.

&gt;But I guess if I had to choose a few things: I guess saying nasty things about the Holocaust? Using the N-word in a negative way

So you do think there is a line but we just disagree on where it is perhaps? I think Trump crossed it but it honestly it has more to do with the context than the statement itself. I feel like it is not something the President of the U.S. should say considering the strategic implications of it more than anything else such as political correctness. 

Edit: So if Bill critiques it from that angle I don't see it as hypocritical. &gt; Elaborate please.
Maher criticizes Trump for saying un-PC things.  Then he criticizes college students when they get mad at him for saying un-PC things.  Maher doesn't like Trump, but he won't admit that they see practically eye to eye on this issue.
&gt;I agree but the original topic you introduced was Trump's statement so I figured we were talking outside of comedy.
We are, but you asked for examples.  Saying a country is a shithole shouldn't be a problem.  Those countries are shitholes.  I get the Haitians being upset about such a statement, but the liberal media is so OUTRAGED over nothing.  Obama called Libya a "shitshow" and they didn't care.
&gt;So you do think there is a line but we just disagree on where it is perhaps? 
I wish there wasn't a line, but there is.  You can say nasty things about anything and everything (without any kind of legal action), but when you get into the n-word, holocaust, slaughter of native americans, you're in some darker territory where most people won't stand for it.  I'm not saying they shouldn't be said, just that most wouldn't approve.
&gt;So if Bill critiques it from that angle I don't see it as hypocritical.
Maher has a strong dislike of Islam.  If a Democratic politician called a Iran a "shithole", Maher would be praising them.  If Trump called Iran a "shithole", he'd tear him apart.  Maher is anti-PC, but doesn't support Trump when he does it (while at the same time attacking liberals who are PC police).  Very hypocritical.
Pretty much. Almost all of them have been co-opted but either extremists or people who have no idea what they are talking about.If he gets rid of him, please get rid of Ann Coulter and Stephen Moore too pleaseThis has nothing to do with PC or anti-PC. People aren't mad that Trump called those nations shithole. They are mad because he used it as a reason to not accept those people into the country. That's the offensive part. Well, Michael Wolff was pretty inevitable. Must have demanded a big fee. I hope Bill doesn't just ingratiate him for 15 minutes.He’s kinda dull no? I’ve never seen him show much emotion over a topic at all. Maybe that’s just when he’s on the news. Might be different on the show. 

Edit: why not have Anderson Cooper on? He’s much more personable. (I do have a bias tho cause cooper is bae) I like Larry Wilmore purely for telling Milo “you can go fuck yourself” 

He’s smart too. Gods, that was a fantastic bit with Wilmore and Nance. They tore Milo down so ruthlessly. &gt; bae

wtf does that mean?  ive seen it a few times but must have missed some meme or some bullshit like that.Lol Wilmore is fucking stupidit was shitwhy's that?he's not funny, and just race baits everything. that smug face could use a hammer as wellwelp everyone but Anfrew Sulivan are deep in the delusional bubble. Larry Wilmore is extremely unoriginal tooLarry Wilmore can fuck off after the way he let Bill Nye be treated on his show.  Are you actually smoking PCP? He was the most delusional cunt on the panel hahahaha. 

Go find help because you’ve clearly had a stroke. Satire and comedy isn’t bullying, otherwise stand up wouldn’t exist. Trumpet cunts love coming to this clearly liberal space and spouting shit. I’m so glad he’s back. 

To all trump traitors, and that is exactly what you are. You are all traitors to your state, fuck off back to your safe spaces. okay than, some examples of his delusion ?do you not realize how much that would take from him in 2020 political election? give him the wall and maybe DACA would actually happen too, and bam no more immigration arguement to get trump re-elected .That was supposed to be comedy...?Go back to r/the_donald What the fuck do you mean and daca? He denied a bipartisan agreement on DACA

He’s not getting re elected. Blue wave 2018 is coming for
That retard in chief&gt; He’s not getting re elected

same people that said he wouldn't get elected

&gt; Blue wave 2018 is coming for That retard in chief

dat bubble of delusion That's a bit uncalled for, isn't it? Should we not tolerate being critical of "our own" without resorting to the same kind of divisive rhetoric as the right?Comparing the state of this sub today with how the environment here was a couple of years ago, I'm gradually starting to realise how much of a real psychological trauma this presidency is to the American people's mentality.  The paranoid-schizoid position seems to engulf you more and more, tearing you apart, day by day.  I genuinely feel for you guys, and I truly hope you get rid of the orange cancer and start healing yourselves - the sooner, the better.I've had enough of your combative attitude. 

Comment removed, and if I see another, you'll be issued a temporary ban. Comment removed, and user banned for 10 days. Where did the "Democrats hate religious people" come from? Last I checked, a lot of Democrats were Christian, Jewish, Muslim and more. Far right Christians have forged a very narrow definition of Christianity (which ironically barely represents what Jesus taught) and because many liberal Christians won't fall in line, they are anti religious.why exactly? I think you're mistaking me for the guy who made the original comment that started this comment chain.  I never questioned anyone's rights to make satire at the expense of a cynical, self-centered, power-hungry (no hunger pun intended) politician like Christie.  That was some other guy who, I just discovered, has deleted his post, which is probably the reason why you think I wrote that one as well.  All *I* did was question the comedic value of Maher's bit, and I really don't see how anyone can argue that it's reasonable to accuse someone of belonging to the Trump camp just because they find some of Maher's comedy unfunny.  I know that the general American discourse has deteriorated since the '16 election, but please tell me it's not gone that far down the drain already?She's kind of below his standard, no?Whether you agree with her or not, this is someone who was imprisoned for acting on her beliefs and is arguably a transformational figure in the trans movement. Whether she can carry on a conversation beyond Twitter cliches remains to be seen, but I find her inspiring. Even so, it's hard to deny that the current "president" has taken it all to a completely new and horrible level, no?What a crap episode.  Bill praising the Wolff book (even though even the most liberal reporters already denounced it as tabloid trash) shows just how out of touch Bill is.  And great job having him on 2 weeks everyone stopped caring about the book.

Larry Wilmore is the worst guest in history.  Dude doesn't make a single good point.  Sullivan was good, very fair.

Maher sounds like a retard when he rips on Trump potentially cheating on Melania when he completely brushed off Bill Clintons White House sexual escapades 20 years ago.whats not legit about her campaign ?saw clips of her speech last week in boston, for someone that tried to kill themself, and was basically mentally tortured in military prison for 7 years seemed very level headed. I think she could hold her own in a debate.&gt;didn't know there were so many military apologists who watched Real Time.

its just "liberals" that dont like her because she made Obama look badFrom what I saw, she was just getting ahead of herself with her stats. Still made sense in the end. Yep. The Religious Right believes that their narrow interpretation of the Bible is the ONLY interpretation of the Bible.Ya it's kind of amazing how due process has been thrown out the window along with anyone unfortunate to have a number of female accusers. You kinda wonder if some garner accusers just because of their fame and notoriety. I know some are guilty but, I don't think all that have been accused are. It almost reminds you of McCarthyism.I started paying attention to Bill Kristol during the No Trump movement.  Was surprised by what a thoughtful, principled, honest thinker he is. Yes, he is frequently, colossally wrong, especially on matters of foreign policy. But he comes by his wrongness in good faith, which is better than 95% of conservatives who are shameful opportunists trying to exploit the bigotries of an uninformed electorate. yea, james franco is a good example. turns out his accuser was bat shit insane but HBO was already floating the idea of taking him off "The Deuce" before that came outits a trying time for liberals, their idea of the world has collapsed in the last year.whats scary? Dems wont allow good candidates till we get rid of the old guard. I cringed hard at that. should have just brought up how 87% of congressional democrats voted against the civil rights actyou're fan of Jeremy Corbyn, aren't you?&gt; I hate the SJW turn the leadership took

i hear that, I am one conflicted dem these days. better than saying MLK would be to religious for the dems was my pointhe still exisited didnt he? has a statue, and a klan member? 

and fuck snopesphoenix would have become a shithole without sherrif joewell i am still a democrat, just the rare conservative oneIsn't there an argument to be made that restaurants don't really have the right to live if it can't pay their employees a living wage without making them depend on tips to get by?  It works in other Western countries, so why shouldn't it work in the US as well?There's a significant difference between restaurants giving their employees a living wage, and a nation-wide, federal health care program though.  I'm not trying to be rude, but I don't really see how the two are related.

&gt; you can't just blindly say well it worked for a country of 45 million vs 320 million.

I see this mentioned all the time in the debate about universal healthcare versus whatever the US is doing.  However, I rarely see anyone giving reasons why.  Instead, it's just taken as a matter of course, as if everyone and everyone should just understand it because it's blatantly obvious.  Again, I'm not trying to be contrary or difficult, but I'd like to hear an explicit and reasoned argument why the concept can't be "scaled up", or at least adapted to a larger scale.Really recommend watching the link for Goldberg's last appearance. It's from 6 years ago, and is a real classic.I know people like to fawn over Rick Wilson because he's a Never Trump "conservative" but literally nobody takes him seriously anymore outside of his resist circles in CNN and MSNBC.  10-20 years ago?  Yea he was a pretty respected Republican political operative. Now?  He's burned literally all of his bridges and only exists to pretend like he's some brave conservative speaking out against president because of his "principles".   He has literally not advocated any conservative policy in 2 years.  He also was a big time mud slinger against the Democrats but everyone seems to not care anymore because resist or something. What bothers me is these so called "conservatives" opposing Trump on issues that they themselves have supported quite recently.  This article about Jennifer Rubin is devastating http://www.nationalreview.com/article/454701/jennifer-rubins-trump-obsession-has-made-her-mindless-opponent

Steve Schmidt was one of the main figures in getting Sarah Palin on the ticket in 2008, now apparently he's the virtuous Republican who knows all.  

Sure, I have no problem with them participating in the debate, but viewers deserve to know their histories and credibility on the matters they are discussing since more often than not they supported those issues until Trump came along.  Richard Painter has gotten so bad that law professors are worried he's damaging their profession's credibility.  http://www.weeklystandard.com/the-medias-favorite-ethicist/article/2010953

Again, I'm not saying every "Republican" has to support everything Trump does, criticize away.  I just find the cult around these people so bizarre since only 2 years ago they would have hated everything they stood for.  It's actually quite funny seeing some usual Never Trump critics compliment something Trump does and their twitter followers losing their fucking minds over it.  Not that I'm aware of. 

I'm temporarily removing this thread, as I think this should be a discussion among the mods. 

Apologies if it takes some time to hash it out, but worst case, you can just repost it.

Most of you under ages don't remember Politically Incorrect (or the earlier seasons of Real Time).  It didn't used to be this way.when he hosted a TMZ was pretty gudI honestly don't know, but it seems like the incentive for Wolff to appear would be to promote his book and increase sales. That's the value he's getting out of the appearance so I don't know why they would have to pay him extra. I know the book was already selling well but every little bit helps. A lot of Bill's audience might not pay much attention to the traditional media sources that had been giving so much publicity to the book so it's not a bad way to try and reach them.Thanks for answering.I prefer two. When it gets to be more, someone always gets edged out.&gt; one of them is anti-weed

He could go to ways, either offer huge insight or be a trumpet. 

One is gold.Yeah. It also prevents dilution of the subject. Many's the time there's been 2 guests, both proficient on the topic at hand, but disagreeing. Then just as we feel like it's coming to a head, person 3 chimes in with something only tangentally related &amp; next thing we know we're off the topic entirely.He wishes. They usually don't laugh because the joke isn't funny, so Bill has to attack them as being PC to feel better. I like 2 as well.Is Ethan or Bill nicer?Thanks for the honest answer, that is what I feared. Yeah That would ruin it.MOOOOOOCH!  this is gonna be great.      
Edit:  I was so wrong.Richard Haas (President of the Council on Foreign Relations President) just agreed that the move to Jerusalem was bad. So, oh boy...He does but he goes off the rails with childish personal attacks on people.  He's very charismatic, I agree.Dude, Haas just sided with Michelle Goldberg over Bill on moving the American embassy to Jerusalem. That was QUICKLY moved on by Bill.Brazille ALSO fucked Bernie. Then, when caught, she claimed "as a Christian, she is used to persecution". Fuck her, except for when she finally admitted, YES, the DNC rigged the primary against Bernie.Remember, folks, David Frum created the term "AXIS OF EVIL" of Iran, North Korea AND Iraq to make us to go to war in Iraq and waste trillions of dollars and millions of lives.It's such a stupid narrative.  Given that she was the one to actually send the questions unsolicited on her own to Clinton's team and the question was "What are you going to do about the water?" in Flint, Fucking, Michigan, she's hardly the best or brightest person.  All sides can dislike her for her rampant stupidity.Maher makes mistakes, I notice.  I guess smoking up before going on air will do that.  Comey did not "throw the election to Hillary".As far as I remember, Scaramucci was progressive before Trump.     
One of his old tweets:    
I am not a partisan. For Gay Marriage, against the death penalty, and Pro Choice. I am for social inclusion, fiscal responsibilityMooch is a fucking liar.  He was in Finance.  He knows exactly where those tax cuts are going and is very likely more informed than Trump was.David Frum REALLY FUCKED UP A CHANCE for a great interview.Good line by David Frum.I didn't realize Mooch was reserved on TV and didn't curse or say crazy shit.OMG talking during new rules.  Da Fuck!I've said this repeatedly.  VISA overstay is the main cause of illegal immigration.It was a total shit show but not for the reasons I wanted.Thank you!  When someone brought out the Harvard thing I forgot what I'd been talking about.  The first one.  That was maximum shade.  The second one is funny too, but not as much as the first.No.  He's a stupid fucking piece of shit with a sense of self worth that I can't understand.  It's gross that Bill would give this piece of shit a platform to spew his bullshit and Bill doesn't ever hold his feet to the fire.  The best I can hope of is "...haha...let's agree to disagree...moving on..."I hate that he's now doing two panelists instead of three.  Usually there is one dipshit from the right, one bad ass from the left, and someone in the middle who is totally inconsequential, but I miss the inconsequential person.The show is complete garbage now.  RT was never great (Politically Incorrect was awesome).
Every episode is the same thing:

-Trump is bad/racist/stupid/orange

-Democrats are weak (but he insists you keep voting for weak, corporate democrats)

-Russia fixed our election, the World Series, Superbowl, and the finale of Game of Thrones

-College campuses and social media are too PC ("but excuse me while I apologize to Ice Cube for not being PC enough")https://i.imgur.com/GJoAPvK.gifvIt wasn't good television.  No one tuned in to watch boring financial discussions about a firm Mooch didn't sell years ago due to government pulling the brakes.  We tuned in to see Mooch go off the rails and make fun of staffers.  You can have different political views and still be friends or at least chummy.I turned it off after 5 minutes of that shit. Mos def is the only person to appear on the show that I turned it off half way through. This time it wasn't one person, it was Bill and the entire panel; the audience has always been barely a step above a laugh track.

Let me tell you, it takes an incredible amount of immaturity to make the mooch look like the rational, calm, collected person in the room. Dude made some good points and all they did was attack him rather than presenting any sort of counterargument or *explaining why he's wrong*, which I think is a primary function of the show: to get information to people who don't have time to research this shit.

Why don't we just cut straight to what this show is evolving into: lets have 1 republican and 1 democrat enter the octagon and whoever wins will be the victor of the argument since winning the argument is all that fucking matters anymore. I think it was entirely possible that Bill didn't want a screaming match between the two,  he also invited Scaramouche on and knew the guy was hesitant, and then did not want him to feel like some ambush was set up.Watch overtime.. the mooch absolutely ruins Frum. Not that any of it matters, but it was fun to watch.I think Frum had it coming from the instant he attacked the mooch on his business dealings out of no where and opened an unnecessary can of worms. The mooch went after him after that lol.Twisting into a pretzel to have your side come out on top. I'm a liberal but Scaramucci got the best of Frum.Calmer n you are. I think Mooch's point was that Trump owes his victory more to understanding working class anxiety than Putin. Did it though?  I'm a gay man and even I was disgusted that he'd show up to the show in fucking pearls.   He's never done that before and he did it to make a mockery of people like me.  Thank God his career is, essentially, over. We've done the wealth transfer dance so many times it's a cliche.  Every time we do it the economy turns to shit and another billionaire buys a yacht, invests in housing foreclosure and normal people lose jobs and their life savings.  It's a sucky outcome for all but the wealthiest.Bill is spelled correctly,  what are you talking about?None. I watch the show because it's a live, uncensored discussion between competing ideologies. Generally speaking, no one makes me want to skip an episode. I saw the milo one which was at best cringeworthy.

However, if he invited say a Richard Spencer type, I would probably skip the episode.I have no issue with opposing views. My problem is views that don't contribute to the conversation. Bill has had some great conservative voices on his show over the years. Yes they disagree with Bill, his audience, and others viewpoints but they can make an intelligent argument. 

When Bill invites people like Milo (for example), they don't contribute to the argument. They exist to either A) repeat standard talking points or B) troll. I was hoping Mooch would bring some kind of knowledge to the table but he didn't really. My problem isn't that he had an opposing opinion, my problem was that he didn't contribute much.I agree. Richard Spencer is where I would draw the line (And David Duke). They would have nothing to contribute to the dialogue. 

Also, seeing how he treated Milo, I feel like he would long softballs at them. Deny &amp; subvert. Throw out as many pointless statistics as possible, to obfuscate the issue &amp;  hope your opponent is more interested in being right, than staying on topic. 90% of the time it works, and the other 10%...when they're still pushing the issue...just plead ignorance, appeal to authority if you can but on NO account, do you admit fault.

But if you mean in a moral sense? Fuck knows.


[Mooch talking about it on TMZ lol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI0xgw6dYhs)It's a curious thing. Some episodes, Bill's like a dog chasing a car, and others he just could not give less of a fuck. Which is a shame, because when he really goes for them, he usually comes out on top. But like this week, with Anthony Scaramucci....he just let him wriggle out. A wasted opportunity, sadly.

Oh for fucks sakes...who cares?I don't disagree. That is why I would be disappointed if say Richard Spencer got on. He is a person with reprehensible ideas. Yes, he has the right to have those ideas, but that doesn't mean we have to give him a platform. Allowing hate speech normalizes it. 

Milo had no interest in debating. He is a professional troll. He gets a rise out of liberals then when they get mad, he turns it on them and goes to his base and says "see what liberals are doing to us" and sells books and tickets. 

Tomi is brainless. She is just a hot body they chose to parrot Alt-right ideologies. I don't think she has ever had an independent thought and can't contribute to a real debate.A) Great name.  It's always nice to meet a fellow Eric

B)  That could be because they are inveterate liars who wouldn't know the truth if it slapped their mother in the cuntNot sure who you are talking about.Like I said,  your problem not mine as I could give two shits.This has become weird..It is Trump heavy. I kind of give it a pass since Trump does dominate the news cycle but it does get tiring.I concur. I am not fully convinced that Milo or Coulter are for real. I think they found a market in selling these really outrageous views.  That is more of what upsets me. Milo is a troll who gets liberals mad by saying outrageous things and then uses that anger against them and the sells books or whatever. 

I would be more interested in someone who is genuine. I do also think some people have ideas that just don't need airtime (David Duke and Richard Spencer come to mind)I voted for Obama twice. You are the one who's clearly losing sense of reality. Hallucinate away.Painter is good, happy to have him back on. Schiffs face creeps me out.I hate Jack Kingston with a passion. Trump could burn his house down and he'd defend it. Pathetic little man.Lol.  Law professors are so sick of his shit they think he's ruining their profession.  http://www.weeklystandard.com/the-medias-favorite-ethicist/article/2010953I know everyone loves Painter's unhinged rants but nobody outside of media liberals take him seriously anymore. http://www.weeklystandard.com/the-medias-favorite-ethicist/article/2010953Not enough times&gt;A single law professor, who respects Painter, thinks he may be too partisan but isn't willing to actually refute anything he says. 

Fixed that for you.Anyone else clueless as to who some of these guests are? I know 1/5.
Yeah... pretty sure Schiff is going to have comments on the memo Trump just denied.I see their point here but they're taking it to an extreme place.  I don't think "courtship" is a dirty word even among the crazy PC people.Why isn't anyone attacking Melania for being cheated on and staying, I wonder....  Not advocating attacking her for it, just pointing out the double standard.I thought she did well.Anyone know why the mods disabled voting here?  u/throneofgames?      
I mean, I know how to get around it like 80% of Redditors but I'm curious.50 shades of grey is what Candy Corn is to vegetables.  Perfect.I loved all the Harry Potter books and love re-reading them.  I think he's just making the point that fantasy book reading, while enjoyable,  doesn't really educate or change your real world views much.I think it's just disabled for people who aren't subscribed.AH!  My fault.  I forgot to do that and will now.  Thanks!     
Edit:  Yup, you were right.  That's attentive modding responding within 10 minutes especially as a head mod.  I'm impressed.  Oh there's plenty of ways around it including just clicking someone's profile or subbing and unsubbing right after. The point is to dissuade downvote brigading because the person actually has to take an extra step. I know you can't actually stop someone if their time is that invaluable that they can spend it on things like that.Pretty mediocre panel.&gt; Unless the person is already using the app or has turned per-sub-css off in their preferences

I understand.

&gt;annoying at worst

That's the intention. 

&gt;not how Reddit was intended to be used.

I actually spent a few minutes thinking about whether I care about that. I settled on no. It was a Trump bashing show. Dems can't win like this..Every word this woman said was like she tapped into my mind and said it on television. I couldn’t agree more with her. As a millenial, there are some aspects about our generation I don't like but that could be said of all generations, really.I definitely notice how I differ from people just out of college.  They seem to hate using the phone for voice calls.  Sure you can email or text, but when it comes to getting shit done efficiently especially when its complex, nothing beats a phone call in my opinion.  &gt; politicians lie

It is NOT spin to say that "the books are cooked" and that "the real number is 42 percent [referring to unemployment]."  Those are very real claims that can't be chalked up to mere opinion.  And then they pretend they never said it on Nov. 9th, suddenly its a booming economy.

There is a difference between a lie and spin, and people like you can't fucking tell what that is.  And that scares the shit out of me.&gt; I really would say Fox had the best coverage of the election. CNN was pure shit airing all of Trump's primary rallies unedited

So you're complaining that they didn't edit Trump?  What?

And constantly airing Trump pieces still didn't stop Republicans from saying CNN covered Hilary too much, calling it the "Clinton News Network."  You're a brainwashed buffoon, and like Bill said, its so pathetically easy to move you from meadow to meadow.How do you people watch this every week?

-RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA

-The MeToo movement is bad.  But Trump is against it, but I still won't agree with Trump on anything.  Hillary and Bill and Al Franken did nothing wrong, but Trump should quit for doing the same thing.

-Americans don't read...oh wait, they do read stuff like Harry Potter and 50 Shades, which I deem unacceptable.  They should read the highly discredited Fire and Fury.  (in all fairness, when was the last time a real author with a real book came on the show?)&gt; You're just conveniently shifting your standard for "bald-faced lie" depending on the source.

Okay, cite a single credible source (nothing from the Enquirer or stormfront.org) that says the "Real" unemployment number was 42%, and then cite (from the SAME SOURCE) that the number changed to 4% on November 9th, 2016, by fucking magic...

"Next, you falsely state that the tax cuts "don't even take effect until 2019," which is provably false."

Okay, so you pay your 2018 tax return in 2019.  Since it isn't 2019 yet, the tax cuts haven't taken effect.  Why why WHY do you have an opinion on taxes when you clearly don't know how they work, but are perfectly confident pretending that you do?  You are a microcosm of everything fucking up with Republicans.

"You keep talking about all these lies, but you can't seem to give an example of a single one"

Was the unemployment number 42% on November 7th and 4% on November 9th, two days later?  BECAUSE THAT'S A FUCKING LIE THAT REPUBLICANS CONSTANTLY AND UNIFORMLY SPOUT.  Among thousands of others.  Constantly.  

"Scaramucci never said that the economy wasn't growing before Trump, so bringing up the economic growth under Obama serves no purpose."

How do I have a conversation with you when you aren't AT ALL interested in the actual truth of the matter?  Republicans have become online trolls.- Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression and the Unexpected Solutions

- April Ryan's anti-Trump book

This is what passes for acceptable Bill Maher literature?
"they're all the same!"

Things idiots say to hide the dearth of knowledge they lack.Could be interesting to have the flexibility to let the panel continue and bump New Rules to Overtime in certain situations. The writers probably wouldn't like that though. It doesn't have to be fresh to be true. I thought he might have been coked up. No judgment. Has Fire and Fury been discredited?  The evidence I've heard against it can't match the condemnation from a media class eager to show their objectivity bona fides with some false equivalence horseshit. Here is where the show can be improved.  Instead of the funny little bits of New Rules,  skip that and just go to Maher's end rant.  I do enjoy the rant. Bill has the beginning of the show for his on crowd bit.  Also get rid of the special guest that joins the panel halfway through,  just have them on the panel to begin with.Keep it civil. Last warning.Can we keep Vicente Fox and deport Fran Lebowitz?Would it blow your mind if I told you that there are white people in Latin America and Fox is one of them? He's of German and Spanish descent.Wow, so basically another echo chamber.Im particularly excited to hear from Former Mexican President Vincente Fox. He has been incredibly upfront about his disdain for the Trump Presidency. YES! She shit on Bernie Sanders for still being active in politics. Meanwhile she takes pictures....yay.Still no Tulsi Gabbard. Why doesn't Bill get progressives on? Nina Turner or Symone Sanders.....someone who isn't a corporate democrat?I dislike religion as a whole. Generally speaking, it puts so much weight on myth that is largely fantasy and  can be used to hold captive a society. 

That being said, I believe he has deep seeded bigotry against Islam. I am 100% against the radical extremism but that isn't Islam as a whole.

Bill will often say he isn't going after all of Islam but his words contradict that. In the US, the most dangerous group are far right, white extremist groups, not Islam. 

The problem is extremist ideology that encourages bloodshed to get their point across. If far right Christians had the right to kill gays, I guarantee they would. 

Trying to blame Islam isn't right. Blame extremism. Jordan Peterson, Ben Shapiro, James DaMore, so many better guests to pick from. Even CNN has more dissenting opinions. Never heard of this woman before but it sounds like she's thoughtful.Everyone who was predicting Lebowitz would drag this down was right.  I didn't recall her from any of her prior shows but she just seems like she takes all the fun out of the room.Lebowitz AGAIN shits on Bernie Sanders....for fucks sake.ALL of this Russia shit to make Hillary's not going to the Rust Belt during the campaign a problem.

Hillary Clinton is the only candidate in US history who was DESTINED to be President and deserved your vote, whether you liked it or not.While the Democrats and Bill are bitching about Russia, the actual American voters are STILL caring about progressive issues like the minimum wage, paying the rent, jobs, all the issues Democrats STILL ignore. Trump gave lip service to that and won, while Hillary called them "deporables", told Coal Miners they would "be out of a job" and never visited Wisconsin. Fran Lebowitz has about as much credibility on politics as my dick does at a lesbian bar.The boomer generation refuses to step aside.  It's a serious problem for the younger generation.It's hard when they have all the power.Absolutely fantastic, probably the best panel ever.
EDIT: /sThis is because almost the entire Mexican holds him in the lowest regard. He was always known as a corrupt leader.- Anna Deavere Smith seems like a smart, progressive person, but boy the preview of that show made it look cringey as fuck. 

- Bill is so blind on the film school issue. If only rich people go to film school, movies wont be able to address the issues average Americans face. 

- the fact that Mueller went out of his way to call the Trump campaign collaborators "unwitting" does not bode well for the idea he'll find evidence of collusion. 

- Jesus Christ is Rushdie snoozeville. He might be a great novelist - I couldn't say - but he just kind of repeats whatever the establishment line of the day. 

- I'm a Bernie supporter but I can't be bothered by what Fran Leibowitz thinks about him. She's a lazy wiseass who's coasting on writing she did 40 years ago and has barely worked since. Of course she can't understand the issues working class Americans are facing. 

I wasn't gonna watch this week, but when I saw that that dingbat elitist Fran Leibowitz was on AGAIN, I couldn't resist.

-Wow, so more RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA.  Maher saying "why hasn't Trump been impeached yet?" is dumber than his views on vaccination.  Even CNN said the Russians started in 2014 (a year before Trump announced his candidacy) and Mueller said no American knew what was going on with the Russian interference.  Bill is officially in the loony bin as even places like Huffington Post and Daily Kos weren't getting this worked up over it.

-Fran Leibowitz again with anti-Bernie Sanders, pro-NYC quips.  This woman is insufferable (but the braindead audience loves her)

-Vicente Fox.  He shows how insane Maher really is.  Fox said that the Florida shooting was because of "muh Trump racism", ignoring the fact that school shootings of this magnitude have happened numerous times since 1999 (even in the Obama terms).  The idea that Bill let this claim go unchallenged shows the sad state of affairs of his hosting performance.

-New Rule:  I'm still pissed that #metoo got Al Franken to quit!I love this argument because it means that Trump fans didn't vote based on their family's future, the country's future, their values, or policies,..they voted based on hurt feelings from something they saw on tv. Sounds about right.Ann is interesting though because of the bullshit she says. As wrong as she is, she always gets put in her place and it makes interesting tv. I see the segment of the show where Bill directly addressed Trump supporters has triggered many of them into coming here to cry.&gt; I see the segment of the show where Bill directly addressed Trump supporters 

He does this every week, nothing new.  It's just that between the crap guests and the off the charts insanity of Bill, the show is becoming unwatchable.&gt;If you want to listen to celebrities, sport stars and Hollywood talking heads hurling childish insults for their political opinions, that's your business.

Haha Trump supporters who clearly watch the show coming here to shame us for watching the same show. And you voted for a celeb who hurls political insults so again, the point you're trying to make applies to you more than anything.This has to be like the fourth week in a row that you've called it unwatchable. Yet you still watch. Hmmmm. Funny old world innit?Oh yes, those words that you may or may not know the meaning of magically cancel out your hypocrisy. That's the way it works right? Well played. I watch lots of "unwatchable" things.  But I have a great fascination with people who enjoy said unwatchable things (like this show).Your time is clearly valuable.

**edit:** Also I have to say that "unwatchable" has lost its meaning if people are using it to describe things that they "watch lots of". Like what the fuck does that even mean?Says a guy who is a moderate or dead subreddit.Yeah, that's 10 minutes a week I'll never get back.I don't get why Maher should only invite people he "gets alone with." He should be inviting more people with differing viewpoints so that it's not just a CJ show.This show is 50 minutes a week I'll never get back.Heh good one. But seriously now, you've got me thinking. And I'm not even shilling for the show anymore, you've got me in a philosophical quandary. If someone watches "lots of" something that they deem "unwatchable", do you think it's possible that maybe the things they deem "unwatchable" are actually maybe kind of somewhat watchable? "The Room" is unwatchable, but I still watch it.  Some things are so bad that you can't believe their being aired for consumption.  This show is one of them.  With "The Room", everyone watches this unwatchable movie because of how bad it is.  No one likes it for the plot or the characters, etc.  With Real Time however, you guys legit like it.  You think it's really stimulating conversation and debate.  You think Maher says insightful things.  It's completely mind blowing to me. Fair enough. I do agree that it is rarely if ever insightful. It's more like a political flavored entertainment comedy show but certainly not where I go for news or insight. And there's nothing wrong with that.  Maher puts on what I believe to be a bad show, and we talk about it.  So he's doing something right I guess.  I watched Politically Incorrect and that Maher and 2018 Real Time Maher are 2 totally different people.  NuMaher is very corporate Democrat and crying "white supremacist" every 5 seconds.&gt; Trump is going to quit

I think the same thing,  he will quit as in not even run next election.I like Barney Frank a lot.  I do, but then your dad gets mad.She’s a nobody in the regard that she adds nothing to the discussion.  I watch the show for the discussions, not for the quips of some cranky old woman that writes for a magazine whose only real relevance is the party they throw after the oscars.  I don’t give a fuck if she gives Bernie shit and the only relevance Vanity Fair has it the party is throws after the Oscars.  She’s a crotchety old woman who adds nothing to the conversation other than stupid quips, then sits there looking smug as fuck because she made a funny. I think it would be interesting, the are both very smart.Agreed...but what a clash! Peterson's knowledge and Maher's wit...comedy ensues! Cringey, but looking at the front page of that site has me wondering if it's even real in the first place.

Edit: seriously go to the front page of that site, it’s fucking cancerous.Nothing he says in those excerpts is wrong.&gt; He's a clinical psychology professor. His research doesn't relate to the things he's become well known for.
&gt; 
&gt; Expertise in one field doesn't transfer to another.

Downvoted for idiocy.Bill should have Jordan Peterson on for sure,  Peterson is very interesting.&gt; I have no interest in watching Bill and Jordan Peterson circlejerk each other about how a handful of pink haired feminist Muslim Marxist militant SJWs on college campuses are destroying America.

Well look at you!  You sound really full of yourself.
&gt; Didn't take you long to call me a bitch...classic

Holy shit,  man did you ever put words in his mouth.  In no fucking way did he call you a bitch.  He said " don't bitch at me".  Meaning do not complain/whine.  Way to be a bitch and turn that around on him.I have a PhD in bullshit detecting.You have a few issues,  one is that you put words in other peoples mouths. I wonder why you would presume to know what I was thinking in my mind or try to portray myself a certain way and not a positive way either. You know nothing about me but I find it interesting that you brought up your PhD,  is that a bell you ring a lot?  :)

Also Jordan Peterson would eat you alive in a discussion.Keep it civil or go elsewhere. Thanks. Comment removed.&gt; Dude, this isn't a contest.

I didn't think so but now that you wrote 4 paragraphs I am thinking it may be a contest to you.    

But honestly I am being a bit of a tool but you also come off as arrogantly PhDy.  You do tend to put thoughts into my head that i don't have.  I am not defending Peterson's honor,  he can defend himself a lot better that I ever could or want to.  He is not my best buddy,  we do not know each other.

Let's start again,  and I will not be an ass.  I am saying your point that "Expertise in one field doesn't transfer to another"  can also be that it can and does transfer sometimes,  can he not read all literature and learn without having a degree in it?

I suspect you have a beef with peterson and that is fine.

Also I just clicked the link regarding the Dunning–Kruger effect,  that was pretty funny actually but I have seen it before years ago.  I could be suffering from that effect I suppose but on the other hand...so could you.  Maybe this is where both of us suffering from that Dunning–Kruger effect realize it.  

Also quit using bold,  it's pretentious. Ok I get what you are saying and agree mostly.  I was joking about the pretentious thing, I blame myself.  

I do have a question though,  have you watched Peterson quite a bit or a little bit?  Here is one I watched recently that I really enjoyed,  what do you make of it?

Jordan Peterson debate on the gender pay gap, campus protests and postmodernism:

Maybe
I don't get it,  how does he figure Bill is a racist?Affleck was a fucking idiot in this case.Thank you!umm sorry for shortening a word. Not sure what that has to do with it.

I don't really like Schumer either but I often find myself defending her just because people get sooo carried away with their hatred of her. This is a situation that just seems silly to get so worked up over. He did announce it. He said "We're off next week" at the end of the last show. They take these short breaks frequently.I'm not going to sit through an entire doc about her when she hasn't said anything of merit during the five times she's been on the show.  She is everything people hate about liberals and I can't stand her.She's had five chances to show her appeal on the show and all she's done is show that she's a crotchity old bitch who thinks the world stops and starts in NYC. I think Maher is supportive but could've done without the masturbation jokes.  These kids are great, though.  They're articulate and thoughtful.  I think these kids are exposed to a lot more as a result of the internet.  They're also exposed to a lot of propaganda and bullshit, too and I think it takes time to sort that shit out into adulthood, but they seem to have their heads on straight to me. She's never shown me that she's an intellectual.  She seems like she's bothered to be on the show, then she comes up with some stupid quip and tries so hard to keep from looking so fucking proud of herself.  I really can't stand her.Damn right she does.  I'm as liberal as they get, but I can't stand that fucking bitch.  There is more to the world than New York City.That's fair.OMFG **ENOUGH** WITH "BOTH SIDES!"  Please!You have to own your shit.  I'm not saying you're responsible for it, but the boomer generation has, arguably, been the worst generation in American history.  When you own your shit, other generations can then accept that you're telling the truth.  At what point do you recognize that your generation's behavior has contributed to an "us vs. them" mentality?  It doesn't have to be warring and opposing sides, but you need to admit to your generation's mistakes which don't necessarily equate to your own mistakes personally.In a word: Listening.  We need to stop with the "us vs. them" mentality and do what's good for the country.There are some clear differences between both sides which is the point I'm trying to make.  Let's stop equating Nazis to people against Nazism.   It's not that complicated when you think about it.Sounds like a good idea to me.  Good on you.I can stop doing that when the party leader of the Republicans simply stops justifying Nazi actions.  I believe it's that simple.  I never considered Republicans to be Nazis.  Their leader has simply been endorsing the platform and that's a serious problem.I'm Swiss (and other Treasonous Statements) Nope. Not a word.I think historians would be able to look at the history and confirm my statements.  If you lead the charge of fucking over your children's children and place them in massive debts for your own benefit while staunchly refusing to take accountabikity for it and pointing your fingers at everyone except those who caused it, you might be the shittiest generation.The responses answered this for me.  You don't get to answer charges or Nazism by saying "good people on both sides" after one side used a car to murder the other side.  No sane person would do that.The Swastikas and "blood and soil" kinda clinched it for me.  You realize the irony in your statement given we need to listen to all classes to solve this problem, yes?  Literally our biggest problem has been not listening to the middle class.Have you adopted Trump's whataboutism by accident or is it intentional?You forgot one: the generation that so self-aggrandizingly deluded it believes it gave humanity the greatest everything.

Come on, man - you have to be able to take a bit of criticism without going full "my dad's stronger than your dad".Don't attack other users. Comment removed.Don't attack other users. Comment removed.Me me me.  I wanted.  I I I.  Your generation's problem summed up eloquently.  No one is saying you couldn't have those things or even that you're directly responsible.  The robber barrons of your generation were goddamned pigs.  We just did another 1.5 trillion in wealth transfer and your generation cheered while sane people cringed.  Was that you?  Probably not.  Admitting that members of your generation were simply horrible is important.Yes, in that they enslaved future generations of **all** Americans to a mountain of debt and a shit sandwich to clean up and continue with the whataboutism and finger pointing Trump taught them.  Slavery was bad, but the number of people affected was subjectively smaller and my ancestors, also a part of that generation's time, rose up to abolish it.Accountability is important and clearly something your generation never learned.  More whataboutism and finger pointing.&gt;  the right to defend myself and my property is indeed deeply important to me as an American

As a genuinely curious foreigner: Why?  I'm really having a hard time understanding the American idea of needing to "defend myself and my property" by owning a gun.  I'd love to understand, though, so I'd be grateful if someone tried to explain it to me.Does it have to be either-or, though?  Is it not possible for a certain generation to give the world a lot of good stuff *and* be responsible for fucking up the world?So is angrily outbursting because you don't like something and can't take on accountability for the shitty behavior of your peers.  I have been clearly drawing a line that not all boomers contributed to the problem and the ones that didn't, should turn on the ones that did and engage in respectful and helpful dialogue with the rest of us.I am glad Bill touched on this particular issue as it always bothered me about society. News outlets desperately looking to remain relevant so they become click-baity or otherwise go for low hanging feet. Someone does something, 50 people on Twitter get outraged, news story..... Profit?

Seriously, let's get back to real news.Totally depends on the guests. Sometimes the two guests can be woefully short on material. But when you have someone as knowledgeable and funny as historian Jon Meachem and someone as relevant and smart as Eric Holder, there is a ton to hear about so a third person is not necessary. I agree that I tend to lean more toward the 3 person format just to be safe, but certainly the quality of guests is more important than the quantity.I don't want you to feel disrespected and I apologize that you do as it wasn't my intent.  I would point out that your first response was swearing at me.Cool it with the namecalling. We don't allow that here. 

&gt;Well, I'm out of this sub.

You said 10 comments ago.12.5 million slaves vs. 141 million Americans.  Obviously the experiences were different and slavery was way worse but the number of people affected are subjectively less than 10% of the number of people who will have to deal with the debt.Wow, this show continues to get worse and worse and worse.

-Softball interview with those kids who survived the shooting.  Bill shows how much of a media shill he is by having these kids on.  The shooting was horrible, I'm glad they survived, but man that doesn't make you experts on gun control.

-RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA.  Funny how he didn't ask Holder why Obama didn't do anything about the Russian meddling/hacking (which was common knowledge in the White House by 2015).  Also funny how Obama once said "the 1980s called they want their foreign policy back" with regards to what Romney saw as a growing Russian threat.

-"Trump is doing nothing about Russia".  What does he want Trump to do exactly?  The Russians did most of this through Facebook. Does he want to shut down Facebook?  Does he want him to invade Russia?  Funny how there wasn't a single "this is what Trump should do" answer (even from Holder, no less).

-Tiger Mom was good, of course Bill was insane. "There's no left wing Fox News".  Bro, have you looked at MSNBC or Huffington Post lately?

-Bill thinks Russia actually hacked the voting machines.  Is he insane?  Even Obama said that didn't happen.

-So Bill rips on the news media?  Yet rips on Trump for calling them "fake news".&gt; No one gives a shit about Israel's tiny (geographically speaking) wall. 

If the UN called for it to come down, do you think Bill would complain?  I say yes.

&gt;TRUMP DID NOT INVENT THE PHRASE "FAKE NEWS".

I never said he did.  But Trump says "most of this news is fake news nonsense" and Bill this week said "most of this news is fake news nonsense."

&gt;Israel - Pretty much every president agrees that the Embassy should move to Jerusalem

Yet none did it until Trump.  Bill flat out said "I hate to agree with Trump, but he's right about the Embassy in Jerusalem".

&gt;Bill hates all religion

He said that one reason Democrats lost the election is Islam.  He said when a terror attack happens Dems look to not place blame on Islam.  He got into a big fight with Ben Affleck about it.  He also said Mike Pence and Islam are both homophobic, but only one wants to throw gays off rooftops.

&gt;Trump isn't anti-PC because he's an everyman, it's because he has no filter on his brain.

Doesn't matter the reasoning.  Every other week Bill is doing a "college kids/hollywood/liberals, etc" are apologizing for offending someone on twitter.

You didn't disprove any of my points.Thanks for your answer. I still have to wonder, though: Everything you're stating as reasons for having a gun is true of a lot of other countries as well.  Why is the US special?This sub is clearly full of T_d shills, bots and Russians. /u/ThroneofGames do something please?i noticed this too hes clearly in a threatening stance.&gt; Trump likes hamburgers. I like hamburgers. See how this shit works?

Hamburgers aren't a political issue.  You sound desperate.I get what you're saying, but it still doesn't explain what it is about guns and the US in particular.  People have a right to defend themselves from harm in every country, but only Americans believe that right extends to everyone having the right to own a gun.  Why do you think it's different in the US?Mr. Mueller has been made aware of our situation.

&gt;A Spokesman for Mueller's Office declined to comment.&gt;Pot

Who cares?

&gt;Gitmo

He did this on his blog, not on the show.

&gt;Spying on Americans

He's ripping on liberals for not criticizing Obama, he's not criticizing Obama himself.  Of course this coming from the guy who never criticizes Hillary.

This is the most delusion subreddit.You do realize that that sanctions vote was for more than just sanctions against Russians election meddling, right?

And one of the people who voted NO was Bernie Sanders.  Is he a Russian operative who was working on the Democratic side to destroy Hillary's chances at the nomination?

And lets say Trump approved these sanctions.  Do you think Maher and Holder would not have had the exact same conversation they had last night?There definitely are a lot of other countries where it takes the police more than 15 minutes to get to a house.  It might be because they live far away from urban centers, or it might be because of topography and bad roads (in mountainous areas, for instance).  Where I come from, the police in certain areas have an expected response time of up to 45 minutes.  To get a gun permit, you still have to prove that it's either for hunting or competition shooting.  "Personal protection" isn't a valid reason.  Since 2008, we've had 36 gun murders in the whole country.  Last year, we had one.This might just be me being dense, but I'm not quite convinced that the amount of people who live like that should be a relevant argument for whether or not there's a good reason for everyone to have the right to own a gun "just in case".  I'm open to hear your arguments, though.They're both intended too keep out the people who are on the other side of it.  The mental gymnastics on this subreddit is insane.Israel says their wall is for security purposes against terrorism.  The US wall would be for security purposes against bad hombres and drugs.  I haven't seen this level of mental gymnastics in a long time.Consult a medical journal if you seriously doubt that people under 20 have an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex or have higher amounts of androgens coursing through their veins.

It's not generational, it's a biological fact.Love Trump or hate him... but terrible guest list. Ana Navarrow is the token republican-apologist, Bari Weiss was just on his show 2 shows ago, Kathy Griffin committed an almost treasonous crime. Dafuq.That's very easy to do. I said 'an almost treasonous act.' Forget for a second that Kathy Griffin was a celebrity. An average person depicting a decapitation of the president could be seen as a threat to the life of the president, regardless of what the doer's intent was when retrospectively evaluating the situation. Threats made against the president, president-elect, vice president or vice president-elect are a class E felony under federal law. That includes any "threat to take the life of, to kidnap, or to inflict bodily harm" upon those officials. If Kathy Griffin wasn't a celebrity, then secret service would have surely taken a harsher stance against her.You know you really ought to educate yourself instead of watching Trevor Noah re-runs before you start "LOL'ing" on reddit.

United States v. Stickrath, 242 F. 151 (D.C. S. D. Ohio 1917). , is a case that was decided by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, in which it was ruled that threatening the President of the United States was akin to treason.

https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/44/592/1875393/But did I say it was treasonous? No. I said it was almost treasonous. And it's not far fetched to think so if there's been at least one or more court cases that have ruled on this issue."Who do you believe? The fake blonde with the huge tits or Stormy Daniels?" Fucking hilarious!I just realised that public discourse has come to the point where I honestly don't know if people who write posts like this are serious, satirical, trolling for fun, or hired by the russians to split people apart. I think we need a Poe's Law 2.0.Not so much refute as take exception to.  Surely there has to be a better way to get a point across than calling someone a stupid bitch and ranting like anyone's drunk uncle?  The reason why we've gotten to this point in the first place is that the discourse has become dominated by those who let their emotions get the better of them, rather than trying to communicate like people.  There might very well be a decent point somewhere in your post, but the way you present it ensures that you'll never convince someone who isn't already on your side.And she's supposed to be the 'republican' lolI agree. I doubt she'd have been on the show last night if she had done something similar towards Obama.I would bet my mortgage his show would become more enjoyable if he would take a shift from Trump bashing and actually have sophisticated conversation instead. For example, there was NO mention of the jobs report from yesterday where we added 313,000 jobs and have the lowest unemployment rate. I get it... we hate Trump... but we should still talk about facts and actual things that are happening.After last night you can add NK to that list.I agree. And people like Ana Navarro always take the bait and can't stop thinking, talking and breathing Trump.So do you deny that Trump has had any positive influence on the economy and stock market (vs. 'not fucking it up')? If you do deny, then how do you explain the clear upward spikes in Dow Jones Index day after Trump's election and inauguration?Who is "you people?" I'm only a viewer interested in watching a fair and balanced show. And did I say **anything** about Obama in my post? Why the comparisons? No I wouldn't "cry" (you're probably crying these days though) if Maher or his guests call out the negative things our president is doing. I'm all for calling out the president for the bad things he does, but also for giving credit for the good things he does. Because if we don't follow that rule, then we are truly invested in a highly divided, tribal state of affairs. Just be fair that's all I'm saying.And what were you right about? The fact that I want a balanced show rather than an hour long cry about how Trump is hurting feelings? Please. Maher used to be so much better now he's catering to the likes of you.LOL. ROFL. LMAO. Pretty obvious the election loss has caused you to reach new heights of comprehension difficulties, cognitive dissonance and clinical depression. As I said, I would be happy for the show to talk about the positives AND negatives about Trump (as well as any other president like Obama). If I wanted to hear about how Trump is"hurting feelings" I would watch a live stream of the Kathy Griffins or Chelsea Handlers of this world... or perhaps a vlog of your daily routine.S.E. Cupp must be overdue for an appearance by now.username checks outWow, another shit episode.  How shocking.

So Maher thinks Stormy Daniels will take down Trump?  I thought Russia was gonna take down Trump?  I thought Trump wouldn't make it to Christmas 2017 as President (yes, Maher said this).  Is this what it's gonna be?  Every episode will have the "that's it, Trump is now done because of &lt;insert scandal of the week here&gt;."  It's literally laughable at this point.  Instead of getting on the Democrats who don't have a message and run pro-corporate candidates, this in the nonsense he's talking about.

Kathy Griffin.  Holy fucking shit, having this unfunny woman on is bad enough, but the fact that he's defending her is insane.  I'm not against what she did, I'm for anything, BUT when you do something like that you have to expect some kind of blowback (freedom of speech goes both ways).  If Larry the Cable Guy took a pic holding Obama's severed head, do you think Maher would have him on to tell his side?  Fuck no.  And Kathy said "that's the administration we have now".  Is she stupid?  If ANY celeb since the history of photography took a pic holding the current presidents bloody head, the DOJ and Secret Service would be all over them (and rightfully so).

Anna Navarro.  Get this woman off the screen.  She's unwatchable.  "TRUMP IS BAD" &lt;thunderous applause&gt;

Liberal Redneck.  I only see this guy on Real Time.  Get this nobody out of here.  Not funny, not informative.

Bill talked about a "fringe on the left that attacks normal liberals like him and Bari Weiss".  He's wrong, those are not fringe liberals, those are MOST liberals nowadays.  Maher thinks everyone is like him (left wing political views but a 100% free speech attitude).  He's the fringe element.  Liberals in college, on twitter, in gov't, etc have all lost their minds on the issue of free speech.

Erick Erickson.  "The Dark Knight should have won Best Picture.  Why don't the movies I watch with my kids win Best Picture."  Jesus Christ.

After watching this panel, I thank God Trump won.  Can you imagine having a psycho like Anna Navarro or "Dark Knight should have won Best Picture" guy in charge?Who's in a frenzy?  Who's triggered?  I just can't believe how bad this show is.  Anyone who has watched my since Politically Incorrect (way back when it was on Comedy Central) knows what I'm talking about.Ana Navarro with the lame conventional wisdom and corny one-liners. I'm giving a review.  I've been a fan of Maher much longer than you have.  Go back to your safe space if you can't take it.Go cry some more.  No, I'll keep watching and bitching about when I see fit.  Based on your logic you should just ignore me.I assure you I'm not being dismissive or condescending here, I might just be a bit out of touch, but I honestly don't understand what you're trying to say.They are old enough to have opinions, but what I heard was understandably charged emotion with no actionable political commentary.Again, go cry some more.  "Wahh, I can't ignore you because this is a small sub!"  You literally sound like an instagrambabby that just can't not look at a controversial pic or tweet.  YOU HAVE to read it and comment on it, instead of just brushing it off.

I'm sorry you like the show so much, it's not very good and says a lot about your tastes.First of threaded tweets [here](https://twitter.com/drvox/status/972915124032888832)

Or, if you prefer to link to the bottom of the thread and scroll up, as I do, click [here](https://twitter.com/drvox/status/972932560568365058)I don't think Bill was singing Trump's praises so much as saying this meeting may as well happen.

North Korea will undoubtedly make Trump eat shit, but there are worse outcomes when dealing with a rogue nuclear state.

Perhaps if the DPRK had been dealt with at any point in the past 20 years, the US wouldn't be over a barrel now.So my two cents on Kathy Griffin. Her joke was absolutely in terrible taste. That being said, Kathy Griffin isn't a threat. if everything she said was true, I think the government went overboard. Should the secret service investigate her? Probably. Just following protocol. But then they would likely see that she was no threat to anyone and let her go. 


She was a D-List comedian who made an awful visual joke with no real priors or reason for anyone to believe she would actually harm the president.

I don't know, I just feel like they took it a bit too far. I think part of it is because there are trolls. Bill Maher is a controversial left leaning figure in the world. He will undoubtedly attract right wing trolls. Now that the president has seemed to bring out some of the worst trolls, you will see it more. 

On the flip side, there are people on the left who are just angry at where the country is at. They hated that Bill supported Hillary and don't see him as left leaning as they are. 

There is also a third group who experiences burn out. The show has become "what has Trump done now" and after a while, it gets old. What about this wasn't constructive criticism?  I'll admit my language can be a little flowery, but I presented a legit case.  Go to a safe space if you can't take it.Because the show and Maher are a pale comparison to what he and his shows used to be.  Watch old Politcally Incorrect episodes and Bill's old HBO standup routines.  You'll see a guy who rarely went with the mainstream media/talking points nonsense of either political party.  But now he's in 100% in with the media and his show is like a program that was crafted by Hillary and the DNC.  The transformation to me is very shocking.Motivation coming from an emotional place is obviously not a problem in and of itself.  Without emotion, there would be no motivation in the first place, nor any reason for disagreement.  So I'm not trying to argue that people being emotionally invested is bad.  There is, however, a difference between being emotionally motivated, and letting emotions get the better of you to the point where the debate is reduced to people rabidly shouting slogans and derogatory statements at each other.  Even if someone's arguments are informed by emotion, they don't have to be flooded by them for the emotions to be a valuable part of the argument.

The problem today is that the emotional involvement has gotten too strong.  We know from social pscyhological research that people are more likely to think in terms of black and white, us and them, when they're highly emotionally activated.  This, in turn, leads to a discursive environment where the way people communicate with each other cement and reinforce those dualistic positions, rather than encourage understanding and honest debate.  This universal, human mechanism is hijacked by populist and totalitarian politicians to create a divide in society, which they then proceed to exploit.  That is what I'm referring to when I say that people letting their emotions get the better of them is the reason why we are where we are now.

I'm obviously not saying that it's the *only* reason.  There are many structural, societal, economic and other factors involved as well.  I do, however, believe that the over-emotionality of the public discourse is an important and problematic ingredient in today's climate.Ok.. fair points.. I disagree... but wages are up.. are they not? unemployment is lowest.. is it not? whatever measure you choose to assess the economy... it's looking pretty good right now... right? Tax reform is enabling companies to invest heavily into their employees and job creation (i.e., like apple). I mean... I get it... Trump is hard to like for anyone... but am I missing something here or is the country isn't exactly in a post-apocalyptic state like most people predicted?I would take your point except for the fact that Trumps presidency has undeniably sky rocketed the rate of growth for economy, jobs, and stock market. The numbers don't lie.The downside is that Ted Cruz will use Beto being on Real Time as how he is a godless liberal. Won't play well in bigger cities in Texas but will work in small town Texas. 

Either way, I want Beto to crush Cruz Probably how Trump destroyed his career, [hilarious segment on Colbert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvcIeSfaB3c).Yes. The problem is Texas does make it difficul for Democrats to vote. The states can hire Robert Mueller and have him continue with the goods.  Anyone who thinks that Mueller doesn't have a doomsday plan in place is crazy.I hope Andrew McCabe files for wrongful termination.Sorkin basically said nothing.  To be fair, toward the end, he has added something about the banks.I see Bill is looking at Pelosi's record, but I really wonder how much Republicans give a single shit about having a good record as a lawmaker.  It's all feelings and instinct, not facts.Must be nice to be rich.      
Billy Bush:  My life was destroyed so I spent a couple of weeks in Japan and have another vacation coming up.The bald guy was entertaining, but his teeth/dentures were distracting as fuck. I could easily live the rest of my life on that money.  Easily.I vote all the time (granted I don't live in Texas anymore). 

When you say you don't have problems in rural Texas, in relation to what?Well keep in mind Texas is gerrymandered as hell and that is by design. Because Republicans know that with the large minority bloc in Texas, they would lose the elections. Take Austin. It doesn't even have it's own voting district. It is divided into five and those are joined with other larger, red districts. 

Also, there has been suppression of voting drives making registration to vote harder. It is possible to turn the state blue but Republicans have made it difficult with our voting laws. Nayyera Haq gives this long lecture throughout the show about men always being the ones to start talking inappropriately about women and making crude sexual jokes in the work place and less than 20 minutes later (on overtime) makes a crude sexual joke (completely unprovoked, i.e. nobody was talking about anything remotely sexual) about Bill's parents paddling him in a sexual way... what a fucking idiot. And the panel tries to move on from her joke several times in an attempt to save her; nope! she won't let it go and tries to deliver the punchline 3 times.Agreed,  Bill keeps misreading the "oohhhs" and its weird that he doesI gasped when Nayyera said "I'm not laughing". Good for her. An incredible bit of intel on Trump, TBH. The media won't give it any play because it's so obvious  BUT IT'S THE SMOKING GUN OF HIS BEING A SLEF-AWARE BULLSHIT ARTIST. BETO O'ROURKE.  Bill seemed to hate talking to this guy.  I thought he was great and EXACTLY what the Democratic Party and America needs.
Bill didn't praise him for not taking any PAC money. But Bill had no trouble with Hillary (or any other corporate democrat) taking unGodly amounts of PAC money.
Bill is such a retard.  Every week he says things like "why do liberals tear down other liberals over minor differences?" only to pretty much blow off Beto because he put Russia and climate change below jobs and healthcare.

RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA.  He even said "I don't want to talk about Russia every week, BUT this week is different!"  There's a reason why no one talks about this show, and this is one of those reasons.  It's literally the same show every week.

"I THINK TRUMP IS GONNA FIRE MUELLER!"  This show is literally just gossip at this point.  All through the Monica Lewinsky investigation right wing radio shows were talking about how Bill Clinton would fire/marginalize Ken Starr, but this never happened.

"THERE'S NO COLLUSION, WHICH IS RIDICULOUS".  ???  No one denies that Russia was doing shady shit, but there's ZERO evidence that Trump was working with them or even knew about it.  That's what COLLUSION means.

"THEY GOT INTO THE VOTING MACHINES.  WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL".  This is an exact quote, is Bill braindead?

BALD GUY:  "THEY'RE GONNA IMPEACH HIM WHEN HE FIRES MUELLER."  &lt;huge cheers&gt;  The audience is even more braindead than Maher.

"PUTIN IS STILL FIGHTING THE COLD WAR".  Implying that the US hasn't been doing shit against Russia since the end of the Cold War.  Has Maher been replaced with a DNC robot?  He used to be the "the USA is no saint nation, so sometimes what goes around comes around."

ANDREW ROSS SORKIN.  Why do the only smart people on the panel not talk enough?  He was very smart.

BILL AND BALD GUY:  "People don't vote with their wallets." &lt;huge cheers&gt;.  Get this guy off the show forever.  Even Bill said to him "very brave of you" sarcastically.

BILLY BUSH.  How current and topical.

FEMINISM AND WHITEKNIGHTING.  Jesus fucking Christ.  Stuff like this is why Trump will continue to win.

NEW RULE:  LEAVE NANCY PELOSI ALONE!  Bill is such a pathetic pro-corporate Democrat supporter that it's sickening.  He praises Republicans that come out against Trump but rips on Democrats for attacking his precious cocktail party buddy Pelosi.  The rest of the New Rule was just a Nancy Pelosi ad.  (and Lamb won no less).  He also wants Democrats to be tough, but gets mad when Democrats act tough like Lamb and Beto.  Bill, you are the problem.What situation is that?  The Russia situation that Obama ignored because he didn't want to disrupt Hillary's impending victory?America has fucked with more elections of other countries (democracy or not) than any other nation on Earth.  Two wrongs don't make a right, but that doesn't mean America is innocent in all of this.Conspiracy nonsense that never happened.  Here's a clip from an NPR article (I guess they're anti-Obama too right?):

So why didn't Obama's administration do more?

That isn't clear. Some former administration officials who have talked about it publicly have reproached themselves for not acting more aggressively. There also was a long-standing criticism of Obama that his foreign-policy making amounted to endless process with no outcomes — hours of meetings that yielded more meetings but no ultimate action. 

https://www.npr.org/2018/02/21/587614043/fact-check-why-didnt-obama-stop-russia-s-election-interference-in-2016I received the podcast version of the show and overtime maybe 2 hours after the show aired on television. Maybe it's your podcast provider? Yeah it seems more on the side of 'he's upset they're not laughing at his joke' rather than 'everyone is offended by everything and free speech is dead'.&gt; I mean atleast we never gave anyone Trump.

Uh, we've given countries horrible murdering dictators that were only their because they were in line with our economic and political needs.  This "herr derr Trump is le evil" nonsense is why no one respects Democrats anymore.He 100% lost an "I'm not PC" card the moment he apologized to Ice Cube and the offended liberals for saying the N word.&gt; Trump may not be evil but he is an idiot

You're an underage that never lived through George W. Bush.  Anyone is better than him.  What you're spouting is nonsense.  People said the same thing about Reagan (he's old and unhinged and will launch nukes), but again that never happened.  The fact that people still fall for these nonsense scare tactics is what really scares me.

&gt;Atleast we were never that dumb.

Yeah, you're right.  It's better that we put in dictators who literally murdered thousands of innocent men, women, and children just to keep daddy USA happy.

&gt;Russians helped 

And anyone who really believes that a few Russian facebook memes turned the tide of the election should fucking kill themselves.Of course.  Russia was doing whatever they could to fuck with out elections.  But the real question is why didn't Obama do anything when he knew back in July of 2016 when it was common knowledge within the White House and the intelligence community?  Why does he get a pass?&gt; It’s been proven to be more than just a few memes

Such as?

&gt; if you really think Trump is worse that George Bush you’re fucking delusional

That's what I said.  People like you and Maher give Trump more criticism than W. Bush, when Bush was probably the worst President ever.

&gt;Yes we have empowered dictators but America has never fucked around when it comes to nukes, 

That's because most countries that have nukes are powerful dictatorships or our allies.  It's amazing how poor your mental gymnastics are.  You're literally rationalizing our evil foreign policy.

&gt;For arguments sake go ahead and list the brutal dictators we have created and I will give you a list of dictators Russia has propped up just as long.

I don't care what Russia does to other countries.  We're supposed to be the good guys out there and after 2016 we're crying that "big bad Russia" messed with our elections when we've been doing it for decades.&gt; Lol we aren’t the good guys as you’ve pointed out but we keep order in the world.

I didn't say we were the good guys, I said "we're supposed to be the good guys", meaning we try to make it seem like other countries should be like us and our values and ethics are above theirs.  And keep order in the world?  Are you high?  The world is a mess partly because of US foreign policy.

&gt;Honestly you sound like one of those Russia trolls working for Putin. 

"herr derr Russia troll"

&gt;You’re defending one of the world’s most powerful dictators attack on this country because “America has made plenty of dictators”.

Your comprehension skills are poor.  Show me where I defended Russia.  They're the bad guys, they do bad things, but it's shocking that the bad things they do are the things we've been doing for decades.

&gt;Did you miss the DNC and RNC getting hacked? 

Of course not, but again, do you really think a few facebook memes and some emails about Clinton aides emailing stupid things was enough to turn an election? (it certainly didn't influence the popular vote that dems love to trot out in their arguments).  It's also to the point where you barely here about the hacks in the media (or ever Real Time) it's all about the facebook nonsense.Thanks a lot, many old seasons are available here. Awesome!Ya. Ted Cruz has always upset me as a Texan. He is probably the most hated man in Congress but he loved the Jesus so the evangelicals in Texas vote for him. He also has an "R" by his name so the Republicans in Texas vote for him. 

He says he is a constitutionalist and people just take him at his word. He doesn't stand for much anything constitutional.

I want Beto to take his place in Texas so badly. We don't need Ted Cruz making us look like a laughing stock anymore. So Biden CLAIMS Obama asked for a bipartisan Bill to be signed, but that McConnell wouldn't sign it.  Since when does a bipartsan Bill need to be signed for the President and the his intelligence community to investigate election fraud?  Obama could have held a press conference in August 2016 to talk about Russian meddling, instead he kept quiet on the issue BECAUSE HILLARY WAS WINNING.  If the polls showed her down by 10 points he would have been talking about in non-stop.
"A representative for McConnell disputed Biden's claim".  So this is just he said/she said.
Even NPR doesn't know why Obama didn't do anything.  And it's not "her derr because McConnell wouldn't sign this piece of paper" nonsense.&gt;"appear partisan"

Yeah, Obama was so partisan when he was trashing Trump constantly and appearing on Jimmy Kimmel and making jokes about how Trump would never be President.  Are you even listening to yourself?  Obama let this go on and on and on and SAID and DID NOTHING.  When Trayvon was killed, he couldn't wait to open his mouth and declare him his son, but Hillary's campaign is under attack by RUSSIA an he stay tightlipped because he doesn't want to APPEAR partisan?  If you really believe this I feel sorry for you.  Hillary was winning handily up until election day 8pm so he didn't want to screw that up (because if he did do the right thing and talk about Russia and Hillary lost, he thought he might get the blame and it might hurt his pristine presidency).You sound like a snowflake pussy.  Using the N word in a joke is fine, and needs no apology.  Of course Maher, like you has no balls.[Mitch Landrieu addresses removal of Confederate statues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csMbjG0-6Ak)Don't go The Daily Show route. Just end it when Bill ends it.Trevor was the opposite for me. I liked him at first but over time I found myself comparing him too much to Jon Stewart and slowly stopped tuning in. Maybe I’m just that much of a Jon Stewart fanboy but I believe Trevor should have just had his own show. It doesn’t feel like The Daily Show without Jon Stewart much like Real Time wouldn’t feel like Real Time without Bill. Just one man’s opinion though.Until recently 47% of US Americans were creationists. It has now fallen to 38%

http://news.gallup.com/poll/210956/belief-creationist-view-humans-new-low.aspxThe guests tonight are pretty underwhelming, tbh.  Not because of their backgrounds but their lack of entertainment value.  When Mona Charen is your best chance at a bold statement, you need to rethink your guest lineup.I don't think anyone will take over his show. There's simply no show like this. Real time is the only show which is a hybrid of comedy and serious political discussion.

All the other political talk shows that I know of are hosted by reporters or journalists. Yes, they are still considered journalists and reporters even though they their shows are heavily sensationalized.

Bill is different. 

He is a bona fide comedian, who doesn't claim to be a journalist. He is highly opinionated and he has the balls to host a live TV show where everything you said cannot be taken back.

P.S: I think Bill can host this show for decades longer. IIRC, he is almost 100% vegan and he takes good care of his health. Larry King is much older and he is still around.Old Carlin bit. He would say to Republicans "if you are pre-born you are fine, if you are pre-school you are fucked"Oh he's great, but he's not really funny in the way some guests are funny.  He's more serious and polished than certain guests are.  I like conflict and argument and the occasional dirty joke or expletive.  Bill Maher does his thing of course, but it's nice to have wilder guests who don't have to maintain a totally professional demeanor.Agreed.  He's definitely sharp.  He's also been in public service for 30 years.  I can see why.Well Mitch is already done.  I'm used to Malcolm Nance on MSNBC so maybe he's different elsewhere, but I don't recall him outside of it.Mona:  "Putin supports liberals, too!"  Fuck off Mona.The bitch who wrote: Useful Idiots: How Liberals Got It Wrong in the Cold War and Still Blame America First.She was Shhed at CPAC and now all of a sudden she's some kind of hero after writing: Useful Idiots: How Liberals Got It Wrong in the Cold War and Still Blame America First and Do-Gooders: How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help (and the Rest of Us).She belongs in a dusty card catalog obscured by a computer server with the rest of the useless items in libraries.&gt;Sure President Bush made mistakes, but he corrected them in time to salvage the sacrifices of more than 4,000 Americans. When he handed off Iraq to Obama in 2009, it was a success.     
&gt;Too hard won? Not worth it? That’s a debate Republicans are still having. But Democrats aren’t engaged in debate. They’re engaged in a deceitful effort to distort history.
       
-Mona Fucking Charen
I am so happy I got rid of Facebook after a week.  Fuck them logging peoples' phone calls.Just because she hates Trump's treatment of women, we can't overlook that she lies like the the Trump slut.Maybe we should censor the F-word too. Wouldn't that be more decent?There's an idea. If only the Democratic establishment didn't hang him out to dry.He's also a great moderator of debate, which is a very overlooked skill.The fact that it's trite doesn't mean it's wrong. He is right. Also, back in the day, you would read the news and get a wider array of opinions and information. Today, you can get information that only you like. Doesn't matter if it is true or not. The business isn't about informing anymore. It is about getting clicks so that you can generate ad revenue.[Last week's 'new rules'.](https://youtu.be/STwSMAeuze8?t=257)You could get a more liberal or conservative slanted news paper but in terms of the mainstream, it was more just reporting. 

Nowadays, some sources and will engage in such disinformation and be treated the same as a legitimate news source. MITCH LANDRIEU.  This guy is great.  Unfortunately Bill kept cutting him off like a moron and pushing his "all cops are bad" liberal schtick.  Mitch had some great lines that got ZERO response from the audience.  They only cheered when they got some "low hanging fruit" quip.  They're so braindead.

RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA.  In a week where so much non-Russia stuff happened, Maher AGAIN makes this his top panel segment.  Maher:  "herr derr democracy is in trouble!"  Christ, he literally sounds like a 16 year old at his first high school party trying to impress a girl with how edgy his thinking is.

MONA CHAREN.  How do these nobodies get on this show?  This woman is an insane Bush defender.  Nuff said.

ENTIRE PANEL.  "TRUMP IS BAD.  HE'S KILLING DEMOCRACY AROUND THE WORLD.  THE KREMLIN OWNS CONSERVATIVES IN EUROPE!"  Holy fucking shit.  How can such a discussion happen? You don't have to like Trump, but this is just nonsense.  NONSENSE.

MALCOLM NANCE.  He brings up how Neo Nazis are out of control in Europe, while ignoring how Islam in Europe has done more murders than any Nazi group in the last 20 years.  Of course Maher won't challenge the black guy on this.  Ben Affleck, yes. Black guy, no.

FOX NEWS IS RUNNING THE COUNTRY.  Fox News DIDN'T want Trump to sign the very liberal Omnibus Bill, but he signed it anyway.  So I guess that theory died very quickly.

HE HIRES FOX NEWS PEOPLE.  A lot of those people worked in government, then got cushy jobs at a news organization while the opposing party was in charge.  Now that they're party is in power, they can work again in government.

KGB HANDBOOK.  Nance is a fucking retard.

CHRIS HAYES.  Smartest panel guy in a long time.  Well done.

I'M NOT FOR WAR WITH IRAN, BUT HOW MANY COUNTRIES DO WE LET THEM TAKE.  So, Bill, how do we stop Iran from taking countries to protect your precious Israel?

TRUMP WOULD BE WORSE THAN BUSH ON 9/11.  Maher is a man gone mad.  Bush was a disaster in handling the response to 9/11.  Trump flat out told John Bolton "promise me you won't start any wars".  Funny how Bill seemed ok with Trump boming Syria...

BILL's GARAGE DOOR.  This was a good little story and it could have led into a good discussion with the EPA lady about too many regulations...but it was skipped over very quickly.

CANCER WAS RARE IN THE ANCIENT WORLD.  WHAT?  Maher has lost his fucking mind.  People have ALWAYS died from cancer, but back then they didn't have autopsies, and X-Ray machines, and CAT scans, etc, etc, etc.  So now he thinks it's gotten worse because of the ENVIRONMENT?  Jesus Christ.  This statement makes ZERO sense and any doctor would tell him he's wrong and to shut up.  This is a guy who advocates smoking weed (a big cause of lung cancer) and wants to blame EVERYTHING ELSE for cancer.

EPA WOMAN.  "A bad water system in Flynt = causing cancer?"  WHAAAA?   "We have to listen to scientists!"  I agree, but Bill just said the opposite..and the audience cheered both of them... "Women ruling the world would cure climate change".  How can this tard work for the EPA?

FACEBOOK.  When Obama uses facebook it's good, when Trump does it it's bad.  Both are bad, but Bill is too much of a pussy to call out Obama on anything.  Hillary had facebook on her side in secret friendhship and she still lost.

PEOPLE DON'T READ ANYMORE.  Again with this nonsense.  People read more than ever.  They read books more now than they did 30 years ago.  Just check Amazon book sales and Kindle sales.  People also read newspapers (well, websites of newspapers).  Bill's arguments don't even make a shred of sense anymore.

RIPPING ON JAMES WOODS.  Holy shit.  Like his views or not, Woods is a legendary actor with a filmography a mile long.  Bill tried his hand at movies and failed horribly (he was in some movie as a pizza man or something and it sucked).  And funny how he didn't bring up Clint Eastwood.

OBAMA HAD MORE CELEBS AT HIS INAUGURATION.  This is a measuring stick now?  SERIOUSLY?  Bill actually used this as a some kind of argument talking point.  "Obama had Garth Brooks, Beyonce and Bruce Springsteen there, so he must be better!"  Unreal.

NEW RULE:  RIPPING ON SUCCESSFUL MEDIA PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN ME.  Wow, what a shitty New Rule.  So because people tried something and failed, and got succesful at something else...this is bad?  Maher is someone who FAILED AT HOLLYWOOD, and had to resort to hosting a weekly TV show that barely anyone watches.  There was even a George Clooney quote about Steve Bannon, that sounds like an unbiased source...this is a news-comedy show?I'm sorry it doesn't fall in line with your "herr derr this show is so perfect and all the arguments on it make total sense" nonsense most people post here.

There are even posts saying things like "this weeks show was soooo much better than the shows of the last few weeks"... of course when I criticized those shows from a few ago I was downvoted into oblivion and told how great they were...In all fairness, my reviews for the last few weeks have been pretty similar.The show has gotten more insane as have my reviews.  Maybe Trump is rotting Bill's brain because he doesn't have one coherent argument on his whole show.-calls me a Russian bot like some braindead millienial moron

-"You need a life, you spend way too much time watching a 1 hour show and taking 10 minutes to write a review"

So sad on your part that you put this post together.-they hate just to berate it every week

When did I say I hate it?  And if I did hate it, why shouldn't I still watch it?  I hate the new Star Wars films, but I still watch them.

-Idk how you expect anyone to have a intelligent convo with you when in the OP you're always calling all the panels idiots, retards etc 

"Waaah, leave my favorite panelists alone!"

-pollution in the air doesn't cause sickness
 
Dummy, air pollution is NOT responsible for cancer in humans (maybe a few people in extremely bad areas on this planet).  It's amazing how you just swallow everything Maher says without questioning it.

-herr derr troll

Underage using internet terms like they mean something in real life.

You're a sad individual, bro. When Bill talks about pussy snowflake college kids he's talking about you.Not sure why Mona's getting so much hate. As far as tv conservative pundits go, she was lucid, calm and reasonable. Does she believe some wack shit?  Baked in the conservative cake. &gt; Cancer was rarer pre-industrial revolution

No it wasn't.  Life expectancy was shorter (a lot of cancers come lets say in yours 60s, but when most people were dying their 50s the cancer new got the chance to show up).  And the tech wasn't available to identify all kinds of cancer.  And bodies weren't autopsied as thoroughly.

&gt;food and air cause cancer

Do you believe every shit Maher says?  You do believe vaccines are bad as well?&gt;  just look at the increase over the 20th Century. 

Jesus Christ.  The reason why there's an increase in the 20th century is because that was when life expectancy started shooting through the room.  The longer you live, the odds increase of you getting some kind of cancer.  It's also when "modern medicine" became "modern medicine".  In the 1700s people would die and the doctor wouldn't know what from.  Then in the 1900s with x-ray machines, cat scans, biopsies, etc they can determine what the cause of death more successfully.

&gt;but fast food and cancer does have a correlation.

Unless you're eating 15 Big Macs a day, I don't think you'll be getting cancer from McDonalds.  You sound like someone who gets all his knowledge from Youtube conspiracy vids.  "DUDE, BURGER KING AND THE GOV'T GIVE YOU CANCER!"And Trump and Russia live in Maher's head rent free.The Wright Show. Again not the same but similarly real and smart.

https://bloggingheads.tv/programs/wrightshow

Pollution is harmful, but unless you're in an extreme situation, it won't cause cancer.  I flat out said " (maybe a few people in extremely bad areas on this planet)"  Los Angeles has some of the worst air pollution in America, but their cancer rates are no different that most other major American cities.Yes because you have your finger on the pulse of what the Dems need better than Maher.Is it that or could your own opinion be wrong?That's right I don't have to defend him but I wanted to,  also my opinion could be dead wrong as well.&gt; Yes because you have your finger on the pulse of what the Dems need better than Maher.

Being this much of a fanboy...

Maher is so pro corporate democrat that it's sickening.yeah and you are such the rebel eh..

Bill wants the Dems to lose AGAIN. Nancy is a total failure, continually losing seats in Congress since 2010. We need the energy of the progressives and Sanders wing of the party, not the stationary, corporate democratic party that no one likes anymore.

Bill is being a fool. (or more likely, looking out for his own pocket)You don't have to be a rebel to be against the current pro corporate BS of the Democratic party.  Dems used to rip on Republicans for being involved with Haliburton.  Now Dems are in with Wall Street firms, big banks, big pharma, media, social media, silicon valley, the list goes on and on.  It didn't used to be this way.You don't have to be a fanboy to like Bill Maher either.When you defend his worst views, yeah, you're a fanboy.I would like to see that defense of his worst views I made.   Can you find even one?  Keep it real for fucks sakes.You're defending him for defending Pelosi.  Pelosi (and Obama, but he's gone) are everything wrong with the modern Democratic party.That's it?  That makes me a fanboy?  When you are over-dramatic like that how in the hell do you have a reasonable discussion with anyone?Fanboys defend their obsessions most insane attributes.  Just like you're doing.r/enoughKulinskiSpamLouis Anderson = probably some crappy talk about trans nonsense

Eliot Spitzer = "we need more tough democrats like you".  I'm sure Bill will gloss over the fact that Spitzer used a prostitute to cheat on his wife, but thinks Trump should be impeached for banging a pornstar.

Max Boot = "herr derr Trump and Putin are lovers"

This is gonna be yet another awful show.&gt; Nobody bitch about general personal feeling towards specific panelists.

I like the cut of your jib.I'm sorry.  You can't put this challenge out there this week when you have fucking Geraldo Rivera on stage.  It's like searching for the treasure in Al Capone's vault.conservative here, i miss GWB era bill maherNow do you mean post or thread?I'll be honest, his Tweets to make him seem like a good option compared to other Fox News personalities, but that's not saying much.  You're known by the company you keep."Needs to" is the wrong perspective. It's about the shared catharsis of hating the evil fuck. Bette Midler's pre-metoo interview, where she said Geraldo and his manager sexually assaulted her, got new life recently and Geraldo offered a weak apology. Somehow he survived that. He did try to in part claim that he had something to do with the fall of Milo. Also, he did throw a bunch of softballs at Milo which was kind of crappy.Geraldo was just awful and dishonest throughout.Default:  Attack Iran.  They've done nothing to us.       
Meanwhile: Russia is okay even though they've attacked us directly for 2 years now.YES, BILL.  IT IS AMERICAN TO PROMOTE CAPITALISTIC BOYCOTTS AGAINST AWFUL PEOPLE.  God I hate his "let's permit any free speech except boycotts" argument.Don't say awful things and you won't be boycotted.  It's literally that easy.He was a great Attorney General and Governor.  The hooker thing took him down yet you look at all the other people who can skate by now for the same thing.I believe the technical term is "spiffy"You equate approval rating to success which is prima facie stupid.  I look at some of the policies and initiatives he supported to rank his performance.      
Ethics in Albany.      
Drivers licenses for illegals (what, you want them driving cars with no system of tracking their driving performance?)       
Going after predatory lenders      
Wall Street reform       
There was a decent amount of good there.  He wasn't governor long enough to actually enact much (a little over a year).

Blames Obama for pulling out which created the power vacuum that ISIS filled Would've been greatBut alBaghdadi didn't splinter off until after we left. Had troops stayed there ISIS wouldn't have gained the territory they didWeren't there in the numbers they later accumulated. Why don't you underdtand AQI and ISIS aren't the exact same entity?No ISIS is more than militant outgrowth of AQ. OBL never commanded actual territory read some political science damnitPretty sure that was a stupid error with no malicious intent.  Ingraham deliberately demeaned the kid for no reason.  It was mean spirited.  If you want to disagree with him on policy, be my guest.  This was just a personal attack.It's hard to say because Spitzer didn't last long enough to do anything much.I love real data.  Thanks for that.That's fine.  Go after his policy positions relating to the actual subject.  Attacking him personally is mean spirited and childish.  If he'd responded by saying "Laura Ingraham is a dried up skeleton on the verge of imminent death", he'd be wrong to do that, but that's not what he did.They're notRIVERA Interview:  Good interview.  I'm always mixed on Geraldo, but he was good.  The worst interviews are when Bill just agrees with someone and doesn't challenge them.  He's comfortable challenging Geraldo.  "MSNBC sticks to the truth"...waaaah, really?  Some weeks Maher rips on the media, then he defends them later.  He barely makes any sense.  And according to him, Fox News saying Mueller is dirty and Trump is clean = BAD.  But MSNBC saying Mueller is clean and Trump is dirty = GOOD.  He's so fucking black and white that it's sad.  And he was ripping on Geraldo for being "with the spin".

TRUMP IS PUTTING SANCTIONS BECAUSE MUELLER IS GETTING CLOSE.  Again RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA.  Is this guy fucking brain dead?  This is the dumbest shit I've ever heard.  No matter what Trump does Maher somehow finds an angle.  This week the Washington Post reported that Mueller told Trump lawyers he won't be part of any criminal investigations.

MAX BOOT.  Maher has this guy on and agrees with everyone he says, but take away the word "Trump" and they are opposite ends of the political spectrum.  So Trump wants to pull out American troops of the Middle East (which is what liberals wanted for years), but now this is bad?  Are liberals fucking retarded?  Bush puts troops in = BAD. Trump pulls troops out = BAD.

LAURA INGRAHAM.  I agree with Maher here.  The panel and audience were insane.  People organize boycotts over nothing nowadays.

MCGEE:  TRUMP IS LE EVIL RACIST!  How is this show still on the air?  Whites voting Republican = racist.  Blacks voting Democrat = not racist.  

MAX BOOT.  What a soyboy pussy.  "I used to be a republican, but now I agree with the black lives matter girl".

SNORTING CONDOMS.  This is the generation that Maher wants to lead the way on gun control.

NEW RULE, TEACHERS SHOULD MAKE MORE MONEY.  I agree, but we're in a country where our money goes to immigration welfare, sanctuary cities, and God knows what else.Whatever.  It's a plus for Trump, of course Maher ignored it.  If it had been "Trump IS a target for Mueller criminal investigations", Maher would have been all over it.US citizens should be fucking ashamed about how teachers are compensated,  it is fucking embarrassing.

SHAME - *DING -SHAME - *DINGSmart take. I want to put a different cast on some of that:

&gt;He publicized some college rejection and she made a mild comment narrating him publicizing it. He wielded the power given to him by the much larger issue to settle a petty personal slight. 

Her comment wasn't mild. It was vile. She engaged in an ad hominem attack against a high schooler WHO JUST HAPPENS TO HAVE SURVIVED A MASS SHOOTING. And why?  So she could impede gun reform.  

Hogg wasn't correcting a petty, personal slight. He was using the tools at his disposal to stop the usual red herrings right wingers use to stop us from having an honest discussion about guns.  Maybe if you critiqued something I said and not just made vague, blanket statements, people would take you more seriously.The story used to mention Louis CK, who's been downgraded to "somebody" in the current retelling. I felt Bill came off terribly. Just uneducated and misspoken. Tried to bully Geraldo

So many people have Trump Derangement Syndrome... Bill has it bad. Keeps spewing un fact checked things.Not hypocritical. First, standing up for a cause in a particular instance doesn't obligate you to stand up for it in *every* instance. Second, Laura Ingraham, who is despicable, wasn't fantasizing about inflicting violence on a minor. Whole different kettle of fish. The best argument for Trump and Jr is that they TRIED to collude, but couldn't pull it off. And that's only if you take this family of congenital liars at face value, which why would you be so stupid?Yes. Everyone who comes to a different conclusion than your baseless, reason-free conclusion, is an idiot. Direct link

http://creatingutopia.podbean.com/mf/feed/xiusg9/Podcast_1_Bill_Maher.mp3Yes. Bill floundered around vs a well spoken Geraldo. Probably best you rarely visit if commentary over a tv show gets you so worked upDon't forget to mention Keith Elison. Too bad it's a slow news day..Comey saying: "He brought up what he called the ‘golden showers thing’ . . . adding that it bothered him if there was ‘even a 1 percent chance’ his wife, Melania, thought it was true. In what kind of marriage, to what kind of man, does a spouse conclude there is only a 99 percent chance her husband didn’t do that?" (Direct Quote, "A Higher Loyalty") I'd say that's not a slow news day. The Pee Pee Tape is out there...I was joking. There's this as well:

[Sources: Mueller has evidence Cohen was in Prague in 2016, confirming part of dossier](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article208870264.html)

edit: Oh, and the whole war thing ya know.About that slow news day.. Trump came on TV as of 9PM Est saying he's launching a massive cruise missile strike on Syria. He says he destroyed 20% of the Syrian Air Force.

[Link](http://abcnews.go.com/International/trump-orders-strike-syria-response-chemical-attack/story?id=54459378).Maher is missing a really important point that came out in the news today: Cohen is now known to have gone to a meeting with a Russian Oligarch (now sanctioned) in Prague which he vehemently denied to assist in a coverup.       
Edit:  He covered it at the table.People really don't get that I was being sarcastic? Bill even made the exact same joke as they went on the air. Twice.But I DO tie being rich to often being out of touch.She's voiced that opinion before.She thinks he stole the election from Hillary, I think.Her own campaign poster "It's HER Time" gave it away.I Would still take her over Neera Tandin or Joy Reid again and again.Stop being so obtuse!
Credits of the show this week said so. I agree alot with the mentality. Really well said

Felt Geraldo has moved on but Maher is stuck... Spot on comment though. Thank youI don't think it's fair to throw ideas or writers away because undesirable people embrace them.  If Peterson and his ideas aren't worth engaging, make the case on the merits. Flies are also attracted to honey. That doesn't make honey bad. If you have an issue with Peterson, make your case. I mean...in context Jordan Peterson has said that women are complicit when they are sexually harassed if they're wearing lipstick.RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA.  "He's starting a war because of collusion!"  Holy fucking shit.  So when Trump does nothing on Russia, to Maher he's guilty of collusion.  When he bombs a Russian ally and calls them out, he's guilty of collusion.
At this point it's kinda sad.  EVERY WEEK he gets 2 or 3 anti-Trump people on and goes on a Russia rant.  This week it was 85% of the panel discussion.

THIS WEEK IS THE SMOKING GUN OF COLLUSION.  He says this every week.  And every week it's nothing.

HE IS GOING TO FIRE MUELLER.  Again with this shit?  This show is literally a shitty political gossip show.  It's the fucking View of politics.

WHO IS GONNA GET RID OF TRUMP WHEN HE IS IMPEACHED?  Maher said this after Chait flat out said "Trump is here until 2021". Maher is legit living in a fantasy land.

AMERICA WILL BE A FACIST DICTATORSHIP!  The show is now called "Russia Time with Bill Maher".  I'm literally falling asleep watching this.

ANDY COHEN.  "How do we get rid of Trump?"  This is an actual question to some reality show nobody.  He trolls Trump on Twitter, like some 14 year old pussy.

RIPPING ON PAUL RYAN.  I agree with this.  Not only because it's not "muh Russia collusion", but Ryan is a legit douchebag.  The audience was mostly silent during this segment because they're dumb anti-Trump millennials and lose interest if he's no in the conversation.

PC POLICE.  This could have been a good conversation, but then that dumb bitch Wiley started talking about God knows what with the Mueller investigation.  "I LOVE SOCIAL MEDIA BECAUSE THEY PRAISE ME!"  Maher should have ripped this bitch to shreds for this, but of course he gave her a pass because she's a black woman.

MILLENNIAL'S FIND FRIENDS AND BREAKFAST CLUB OFFENSIVE.  Right here is the reason why Trump won and will continue to win.  Maher thinks Russia is the main issue, but this is the main issue.&gt; It's not far fetched that Trump himself would try to change the narrative with military action. Especially if you consider the fact that a "humanitarian" bombing is completely at odds with Trump's stated policy, going back years even.

So Trump told Assad to use chemical weapons on kids so he could then bomb them to distract from Mueller?  Is that really what you're saying?  And Trump bombed them last year as well.  It's against what he campaigned on, but that happens a lot.  Obama campaigned on peace and he dropped an ungodly amount of bombs.

&gt; We already have overwhelming evidence that the russian propaganda machine targeted individual people in swing states to sway the election for Trump. That's the reason he won.

Jesus Christ, bro.  If you think 100k spent in facebook posts turned the election and not a decade of the PC police mounting their attack, then I feel sorry for you.  Watch Maher's post election episode (before all the Russia nonsense), he flat out said it was PC nonsense that turned the swing voters.I was on the fence. So let's take "Sixteen Candles". What are we supposed to do? Reshoot it? Of course not. We watch it and acknowledge that it was a different time then and our standards have changed. 

Now as for the Simpsons, that still airs new episodes.They should make changes to address this in today's terms. That doesn't mean rewrite past episodes. Just change moving forward. Also, seems pretty dickish for a middle aged white man to tell Indians how they should feel about a character depicting them.That is a misrepresentation. He's said that he doesn't know if women wearing lipstick is helpful or harmful to harmonious coexistence of the sexes in the workplace, as it is a form of sexual display.

That makes no sense at all,  why?As a middle aged white man I guess he should not have an opinion ehHe can have an opinion, sure. But you can't tell people what offends them and what doesn't.As long as people understand being offended is not going to ruin your life. You will get offended in a democracy,  so people need to get used to it.  The weirdest shit offends people,  I am offended by the easily offended.No, it is not a misrepresentation. The way you say it, it sounds like he's just musing over whether that could be a contributing factor.

What he said and implied is that it makes them *complicit*.  Which is absolutely insane and the definition of (get ready for the buzzword) victim-blaming. He used that word, complicit, and was not vague about his meaning.That's gonna be a no from me dawg.Kind of an immature statement.&gt; We're saying he's using it as an opportunity to change the narrative. He didn't create the situation, but he used it to his personal advantage.

If Trump did nothing, everyone would be saying "TRUMP WON'T ATTACK HIS BUDDY PUTIN'S ALLY!".  Maher was criticizing Trump a few weeks ago for not taking enough action against Russia.  No matter what Trump does he can't win with the media.

&gt;What they did is turning regular americans into propaganda-spreading zombies by targeting them with fake accounts and fake news stories.

Dude, 99.999% of the American public is a zombie based on the fact they watch Fox News or CNN/MSNBC.  They were zombies before Facebook existed.  So the idea that a few Russia bots turned the tide when the population is already zombies is nonsense.  And if it worked so well, how did Trump lose the popular vote?  How did he lose New Hampshire, Virginia and Colorado?  This Russian narrative makes so little sense.&gt; He lost the popular vote because the russians micro-targeted people vulnerable to alt-right propaganda in swing states.

(believing this bullshit).  So why didn't it work in New Hampshire? (Which was an actual swing state. MI, WI, and PA weren't swing states, they were blue firewall states).  You're a borderline retard if you honestly believe this is how it went down.  You know why Trump won MI, WI, and PA?  Because he spent 50x the amount of time campaigning there than Hillary.  Know why he lost Virginia, New Hampshire, Colorado and Nevada?  Because he barely spent any time in those states.I never said people shouldnt disagree with Maher.You are implying that things that don't matter to you therefore shouldn't matter to others and therefore they are easily offended. Just because you don't understand why something like Apu can be damaging to an Indian doesn't mean that they are being too sensitive. It just means it is something you have difficulty sympathizing with.Honestly, this makes it sound like you haven't seen the interview I'm quoting, which makes it seem like you shouldn't be commenting.

It's his VICE interview. I'm always happy to discuss things. But you need to be informed before you make interjections.  Watch the interview if you wish, and I'm happy to discuss after. 

You should have this as a policy always, not just this time.&gt; I know exactly what you are talking about and I have seen the original Vice interview as well as the extended version.

Wait, why pretend you haven't seen it then? That legitimately confuses me.

Here's a timestamp: https://youtu.be/T5ahmzySUB8?t=5m35s

He talks about a lot of things. Most of them pertaining to women. Ever wonder why he's not asking about men wearing shoulder pads, which also increases sexual attraction?

It's up to you to how you want to decide this. But to pretend that he's being fair and equal here is hilarious.

Ultimately, I believe you won't see the flaw in your logic.  But the wonderful (and perhaps sad thing) is that no matter what you think, it doesn't change the situation.

I applaud you for fighting for what you think is right, but you should maybe give the situation a little more thought before you decide your'e definitively on one side.No it doesn't,  it means being offended means fuck-all.  Welcome to a democratic country. I understand fully,  not every joke needs an in-depth autopsy.  You sure got a lot of implications and undertones from the few words I said.  Take a breath dude.Hint: 'Any Audio Converter'....I'm not trying to be shitty. That's the actual name of the audio converter I use to get LWT or Real Time onto my MP3 player. Great for long-ish walks or a fair-length car ride.  

[Link to download.](http://www.any-audio-converter.com/download.php)&gt;Now as for the Simpsons, that still airs new episodes.They should make changes to address this in today's terms. 

You just missed the entire point of his segment. Do we fire Apu because he's Indian and replace him with Moe? Do we put Krusty out of the comedy business because he's Jewish and replace him with Reverend Lovejoy? 

&gt;Also, seems pretty dickish for a middle aged white man to tell Indians how they should feel about a character depicting them.

Bill was again talking about people like you that need to go through a beloved piece of Americana with a fine toothed comb in order to find as much fault as possible. You're a douchebag, get a life, and leave those millions of us who like The Simpsons and other classics alone. I would love to intellectually discuss this with you but looks like you aren't ready for that. r/gatekeeping is leaking No idea what you are talking about. I am just judging from your response. For example, did you see "The Problem with Apu" and hear the other side or did you just get angry at what you thought was happening? Rather than listening to other people, you get angry, call then a douche. You clearly don't want to have a discussion. You just want to get angry because someone said something that you disagree with. nightmare fuelBuckle up for the weekend Civil War in this sub over the Peterson appearance.&gt; So many people easily triggered

Stop saying people are triggered when people think the guy you like is a cunt.I blame Canada.&gt; First, he never explicitly states climate change doesn't exist

He doesn't explicitly state a lot of things. Which is kinda the point/problem.  He makes it very easy to say controversial things and then back out of it because he "never explicitly said it."

Big part of the reason I don't like him.Peterson is absolutely right-winger.  I think you're just finding out you're not as left-leaning as you thought there, bud.&gt; feminists defend Islam because they long for male domination

https://www.resetera.com/threads/jordan-peterson-feminists-support-muslims-because-of-desire-for-brutal-male-domination.18620/

&gt;  Frozen was feminist propaganda because it said women don't need a man to be successful?

https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/615e3z/i_am_dr_jordan_b_peterson_u_of_t_professor/dfbz5p4/People are discussing this with you from an informed perspective. We've watched his material. You don't need to keep telling people to watch him and they'll change their minds.

You asked for proof and received it, and still hold your viewpoints.  There's not much else anyone can do in this situation.Oh no. I've been had!No personal attacks against other users please.A classical liberal. Which is more right-wing nowadays. The name isn't as important as you're trying to make it sound.&gt; I am on tenterhooks.

How many MG?&gt; It's hard to take your criticisms seriously when the same two links are thrown at me multiple times, and both are far removed from talking about Peterson's own philosophy.

...They're literally links to HIM speaking. If you find that "hard to take" then idk how you handle life tbh. That's a crazy thing to say haha.

&gt; NOT that he hates women.

I'm seriously so confused when I see things like this haha. But I think there's a certain subset of people that literally need to see the words "I hate women" to think that someone is misogynistic.  Like, VERY few feminists say "I hate men."  Do you think there's a large portion of them that actually do hate men?  Even if they don't say it? I don't think so, but I'm asking your opinion on it.  My point is is that what we choose to talk about is important.

And he has a lot of things that he talks about when it comes to women. If I call every war movie a propaganda film, but don't call movies that portray America in a negative way propaganda, your natural (and for good reason) response would probably be "wait...does he not like America or something?"

So with Frozen, it's like, "wait, you're picking this movie of all things to say is propaganda?  What about The Pursuit of Happyness where the main character leaves his wife and then becomes successful? Is that propaganda saying men don't need wives? He might answer that yes it is, but you'd have to bring it up for him. He picked Frozen.

I think it's super disingenuous of you to be like "well yeah but he's not saying he HATES women so idk what you guys are talking about."  You're treating each case as if it were in a vacuum, and even if you don't agree, it's crazy to act like you can't even see why people would think it.

&gt; studies have shown women emotionally manipulate men on a higher level than men manipulate women

Source?

Also saying black people are entitled for saying the n-word is hilarious haha. I mean, no offense, I just forget that people actually think stuff like that.&gt; trying to draw all these obscure meanings

You're gonna accuse me of not talking to you any more cause I've run out of rebuttals or whatever, but I really am done haha.  

If I'm arguing with someone that is saying it's unfair to use direct quotes and videos about a person that are not taken out of context, I'm not gonna keep talking with someone like that.Says video removed by user.&gt; I really need more than that to think this dude hates women...

Honestly, I should have said this before, but the whole 'hate women' thing might be what's holding you up.  Most misogynists don't actually *hate* women.  It's just holding them in less regard than men.

And as for the rest of your comment, go around telling people that every war movie is propaganda.  Then when they start asking you about it, tell them what you've told me (that it's just technically correct since the movie has a political message), and see if they just say "oh, ok, makes sense!"

I think Bill and Jordan will actually find a lot of common ground. Well he's a cryptofascist that waves away all our society's problems by saying that they are the result of inevitable natural processes, and that these outcomes are therefore right and just. That's all well and good I don't really care what he has to say but it will suck to see Bill buddy up with him because a trans kid didn't let him speak at an irrelevant university in Northern Ontario or somethingHe doesn't say it explicitly but he comes pretty close. Watch the snippets of his videos where he talks about inequality in particular. I've also heard him say several times that 10% of the population is virtually a burden to society because their IQ is too low, but he doesn't bother proposing a solution, he just throws his hands in the air and lets his alt-right fanboys use their imaginations. All this being said, the fact that he is gonna be on the show is one of the reasons I love Real Time. Part of me hates him getting this kind of platform, but seeing Peterson on the panel with people whom he'd otherwise never be in conversation with will be interesting. There are some pretty serious implications going on if you assert that a problem as massive as inequality is a statistic inevitability (keep in mind, inequality has been getting progressively worse since Reagan - not a coincidence). In other words, there is no use enacting policies or acting collectively in order to remedy the problem. 

Of course it isn't his fault what others say, and I don't believe he harbors the worst of his fan's views. But if I looked at the comments to my own videos and saw rampant racism and anti-Semitism I would be horrified and feel compelled to address it. His stand up specials on HBO have always been good too.This is going to be a great show!I can’t wait to see Dr Peterson on there!!I am excited that Jordan Peterson is a guest!  Great choice.It's pretty crazy to me there's so many fans of Maher and Peterson.  I guess if the anti-PC aspect is a huge reason you love Maher then I can see the Venn diagrams overlapping.

But aside from that, they seem pretty much opposite on a lot of things.I have a lot more respect for Harris than I do for Milo or Peterson.  Sam Harris says some controversial things, but not things I'd qualify as 'way out there'.  Peterson has implied that men and women should perhaps not work together, and that there's a possibility that women are complicit in being sexually harassed (in the workplace) due to wearing makeup.  

He never definitively says these things, which is part of the reason I don't like him.  Sam Harris doesn't seem to do this. For one, the things he says are generally less inflammatory, but for two, when pressed he will explain more about his thought process.  Peterson will bring up the subject, or mention that women may be complicit in their own harassment, and then when pressed, say "I don't know. It's a possibility."  There's nothing wrong with speculation, but the way he does it allows him to say controversial and sometimes inflammatory things, all while getting to say he never said that.

He's also said that Frozen, the Disney movie, is propaganda.I don't consider myself either one, but I am definitely more of a liberal.  The thing is, Bill is too.  Jordan Peterson won't say definitively where he falls, but rejects that he's 'far-right.'   Far-right is kind of hard to describe, but by virtually any metric, he's on the right.  He says he's a classic British Liberal, which nowadays in American politics is considered to be on the right. 

I mean, if you look on his sub, the general sentiment of his fans is definitely right leaning.  I guess my point is that they're both clearly on opposite sides of the line, even if we're not sure exactly how far on each side.

&gt; It's why I think Maher's show is best when the panel isn't 100% in agreement about everything.

Totally agree. It's one of the main reasons I like his show.I honestly don't think I can agree with Peterson qualifying as 'in the middle.'  Not that I'd qualify Maher either.  He makes fun of both sides, but he's definitely on the left.

Maybe this is my own bias and my own dislike of Peterson speaking, but he's definitely further right than some people I'd consider center-right.  I really don't think I can agree that either of these people are near being centrists. I really disagree with you there.

Maher and Peterson both criticize the far-right and the far-left (honestly, most people do).  But just because Maher criticizes both, doesn't mean he's a centrist.  He's still on the left.  I'm not sure why it would be different for Peterson.  He can criticize both far ends of the spectrum and still be on one side as opposed to being a centrist.

&gt; It's just that criticism of the far left gets "bad press" and criticism of the far right get's ignored. 

In some isolated incidents you might be right. But I reject this general premise.  It depends on what you consider to be 'far-left.' I have noticed some people (not saying you do, and not only conservatives) judge things that are not fringe movements to be 'far-left,' even if it's not an apt description. 

&gt; That's why he appears further right to you than he really is.

I would agree to disagree on that. Or at the very least say that your bias has the capacity to affect your judgement as much as my bias does for me.I honestly think it's naive to think that Peterson is liberal in the modern sense of the word (in America at least).  Just because the word liberal is in how he describes himself doesn't mean that he's a modern liberal.

Look at his audience. Here on Reddit or otherwise.  It is overwhelmingly conservative.I feel like I directly responded to explicitly what you said...

You implied that classic liberal is on the modern left wing when you said "Maher is a bit further left" cause that implies that Peterson is left. He's not.I think Jordan Peterson and Bill are going to have a lot of common ground. I love Bill and Jordan and am so excited to see this episode!!Bill just said he was a fan! I knew it This is what I expected. I’m just happy it happened. &gt; He deals in absolutes in principle but regards theories as such, theories. It’s not a foregone conclusion that women wear make up to work on the basis of attracting mates, which is his point.

I disagree.  You're right that he regards theories as theories. But the way he handles it is vastly different than how someone like Harris does it.  He sets it up in a way that he can say some inflammatory things, but never assert it.  It's like me saying "Have you gained weight?" and then when you unsurprisingly ask if I'm asking because I think you have, I say "I'm just asking.  I'm not saying you have." He does this a lot.

And the thing that bothers me most about what you just said is that...most things that people do are to be attractive.  Men wear suits that make their shoulders look more broad. They grow beards to make their face look more defined.  That doesn't mean people who are trying to look attractive are complicit when they're sexually assaulted.  I have no respect for someone that thinks that.

&gt; You’ve got to give him credit that he’s no Milo.

I really don't. That is such a low, low bar.

&gt; He may not be on their level on other things, but all of his words are exceptionally deliberate.

I agree. Which is part of the reason I don't like him.  Harris uses his words to make sure you're understanding his meaning, and then confirming it when asked. He's very articulate and well spoken.  Peterson is also very aware of what he's saying, but is careful not to take ownership of them when they're very controversial and inflammatory.

&gt; Milo will say anything to invoke a response, which led to his downfall.

And because he's an asshole.

&gt; If Peterson falls, it will be due to some under the table way, not anything he says.

I'm not entirely sure what this means.&gt; Here’s the thing with the modern late night comedy: can you say with certainty that there is one person in late night more right wing than Bill Maher? If they have dragged Hillary’s corpse out and ate her out, then they’re by default more left wing than him.

Idk what this means tbh. But no, they're all pretty left wing.

&gt; If you disagree with me

I kinda do tho. I don't really see how Late Night is vastly more liberal than it used to be.  I mean it's basically just more modern liberalism.

&gt; It’s just him on his lonely island.

Kinda always been like that mate.

&gt; because he’s not full of PC shit.

I think people vastly overstate this. When most people, including myself, talk about 'PC' the idea is just essentially "don't be a cunt without reason."  Yeah I know Bill rails against PC and had Politically Incorrect, but he still follows that basic principle.  He's not a dick to people for being LGBT or anything, he's not racist, he's not sexist, and would probably call you an asshole if you were.  He's against the crazy PC, like most people are, but to pretend that he just says what he wants regardless of the reason is weird.&gt; If you don’t see how it’s more radically left wing, please look back to clips in the past.

The past did not include such an interesting and controversial Republican president.

&gt; people in Iowa

"How stupid are the people of Iowa?"

&gt;  Bill is condescending as fuck, but he’s honest on where he stands, which is better than Kimmel and Colbert who are trying to simultaneously hold a national audience and shit on anyone who doesn’t live within sight of an ocean.

I don't even love watching these guys so I feel kind of weird defending them. But how can you say these people are way too unabashedly liberal but then say they're not honest about where they stand?

&gt; Maher is the only late night host who remotely understands the small guy.

Again, I really don't think that's true.  I don't watch much Late Night anymore. But I don't think they're vastly different from Maher in this regard.  Colbert isn't trying to protect rich people.  Kimmel isn't crying on TV for rich people. He cried on TV about babies not having healthcare because their poor parents can't afford it.

I'm not saying you can't dislike these people.  But I find your reasoning inconsistent and in a lot of ways contradictory.The internet said it'd be up saturday morning..Oh cool. Yeah no big deal. I'll just wait.&gt; Peterson is kinda of a deepak Chopra. Kinda sound like he’s saying something substantial but when examined it’s really just fluff.

LOL that is such a bullshit statement it is laughably untrueIve watched many many Peterson interviews and speaking tours,  he is about as centrist as it get I think,  In the US he would be a left of centre.&gt; 's just that criticism of the far left gets "bad press" and criticism of the far right get's ignored. That's why he appears further right to you than he really is.

Totally agree.You obviously do not know much about him at all as your statement clearly shows. I am a Liberal and always have and will be,  Peterson really strikes a clear chord with me.  He is clear and gives excellent examples of what he talks about.You may have watched a lot of Peterson interviews, I won't deny you that. But if you think he's centrist, you haven't watched a lot of other interviews of other people.If you are interested in what Jordan peterson is about,  here is a great interview with a really aggressive news woman that is really good:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcjxSThD54

&gt; I'm pretty center-left and I think Jordan Peterson and his lot are repulsive. I can understand having him on, but this guy is really only a step above Milo (who's a troll who shouldn't be dignified). Bill needs to go rough on him.

No you are not center-left at all and that statement just called out your own bullshit.  I am left of center by a bit,  you are far left. To compare peterson to Milo is such far left bullshit that you should be embarrassed saying it. Go watch some more peterson videos so you can actually see what he is saying and try to pay attention this time. Here is a good one:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcjxSThD54

Idk if I'm necessarily worried. But yeah I don't like it.

I've been called an SJW too many times to count. Cause I side with mostly liberal causes like feminism and BLM and athletes kneeling during a song, etc.

Bill does too.

The reason I like Bill is cause while I side with these groups a lot of the time, I don't care if someone insults me or is 'offensive' or insensitive or whatever.  I think people are frequently asshole-ish, wrong, and cunty, but it doesn't offend me.

That's why I like Bill. Cause no matter what's 'offensive,' he still unabashedly does the right thing. He supports liberal causes cause he thinks it's the right and logical thing.

I am not buying what you are selling.I utterly believe he is center.Well, ironically, Peterson teaches it doesn't matter what you believe. Facts are facts.

You can believe all you want. Doesn't change what is actually occurring.I'm not telling you that I believe something so it must be true.  I'm telling you why I believe it. You're not doing that.Here some counter-points in regards to Robinsons bullshit:

"Robinson is immature, and it shows. One of the mistakes he makes is to assume that the people on the other side are stupid.

Mischaracterizing other's positions is another tactic that Robinson seems content to engage in. This tells me that he is in no way interested in scientific thinking, as he claims. It also tells me that he is not interested in understanding problems or finding solutions. Most importantly, it tells me that he is marketing himself to a particular political echo-chamber.  **His piece on Peterson is designed to appeal to people who are already enemies of Peterson's perceived political positions and not to people who understand or are at all interested in Peterson's work.**

Robinson's attack reminds me more of the hysterical flailing of some of the magical and pretend martial arts than it does of an actual takedown that has been perfected over centuries and tested endlessly in real combat. It might impress devoted believers who are already convinced but ends up failing miserably and embarrassingly when it's really put to the test.

I fucking absolutely hate Trump but you missed Peterson's point.So why do you believe it? You didn't say...you said you did but you actually did not.And a counterpoint:

The main point is the Robinson rant is geared towards those who are already on the Peterson hate train, those that already dislike him and so seek out information that backs that up....be it bullshit or not. That is the main point.This sentence means literally nothing.He has his haters that is for sure doesn't he?  He strikes a chord with many people,  intellectual thinkers can all kiss my ass.  Most of them come off as sanctimonious and self-righteous in their own intelligence.  Maybe Jordan is in that vein too but what he states in some of his talks really hits the vein.  Same reason why I really enjoyed Hitchens and Dawkins I suppose.  Not too hard to understand really.  Many people really dislike when some people are popular for whatever reason.   He is psychologist and yet people cannot understand he can also  be well versed in many other areas and topics.He has his haters that is for sure doesn't he?

We have two different points about what Peterson was saying about Trump supporters.  I believe Jordan was saying was that what might happen when you take a loyal bases President and impeach him.  Not that his loyal base is correct,  but rather what may happen.  There will be an affect,  he is wondering what that might be.  I think he believes it won't be a positive one and perhaps be very negative,  that there will be a large backlash of some sort.  I think he is saying...be prepared for that.Harry Shearer (Dereck Smalls from Spinal Tap, Principal Skinner) has an excellent weekly podcast/broadcast called Le Show. Covers a wide variety of topics not often discussed in mainstream media (microplastics in oceans, corruption in the Olympic International Committee) in a funny sardonic way. Also reads all of the "apologies of the week," which is hilarious, and a number of skits he writes and voices, plus excellent music. Care to elaborate?We have two different points about what Peterson was saying about Trump supporters.

I think he is saying...be prepared for that.Everyone knows that's what he was saying. Idk why you think people don't understand that.

The question raised is that no matter what happens someone will be unhappy. Trump got elected and made liberals unhappy.  Why aren't we telling conservatives to be careful not to offend liberals, only liberals to not offend conservatives?

The thing you just said is something everyone already understands.&gt; This is my tl;dr assessment of Jordan Peterson. Note how this is different from "I don't like him for whatever reason."

Ok yeah fair enough,  I have read something like that before.  When I start to enjoy and be interested in someone the first thing I always do is look at what his distractors are saying and why that may be. The question I would have for you is why do some people really like him?  Warts and all. What is he saying that is making him popular.  A bit of a hard question because he has said and written a metric shit ton.  Of the huge things he has said written, are you focusing on the possibly small amount that you dont like?  I've learned that to have an opinion you need to be able to argue both sides.  This may be hard in this case as we are dealing a lot of information here.

Yeah,  he can be really be abstract sometimes but you seem to be ignoring when he is very clear and concise.I am left and I dont consider him right at all,  weird eh?Thank you man,  I though long and hard about that.Right,  he is saying there will be backlash.  A very strong one.  People do not like to be proven wrong and especially to feel stupid.I hurt me headYeah.  I really don't know what else to say. Choosing to not do the right thing because it will make people mad is insane.Yeah. It's one of the few things I don't like about Bill.  SJW is now just a term people use for people that care about racism and sexism and stuff.

100% for every SJW I've ever met, I know at least 5 vehement anti-SJW's.No personal attacks.No personal attacks.Who was the guest that was controversial (out of curiosity)? He simply said expect some shit to go down.and of course no one said any thing of the sortYou're talking about the backlash as if it should be a deterrent. If that's not what you're saying, you're not articulating yourself well.No that is what you got some how.  I said he expects backlash and wonders how it will act out.  No one mentioned deterrent,  that would be ridiculous,  funny how you jumped there though.Don't be so obtuse man.Yeah I know right?  Fuck me for liking him.  Fuck off.You are not worthyLike I care what some dink on the internet spewsBill is in the old man, establishment, corporate Democrat phase.I mean, sure. When I say I don't care, I just mean I don't get insulted. I'll fight back and tell people how retarded they are tho, if warranted.Jesus Christ,  I enjoy his videos,  that's it.  Settle down lol,  the far left really is fucking crazy aren't they?  It's not whatever though,  you are pissy that people like him.   That's fucking weird.  He is just some dude with a bestselling book,  he doesn't make policy.  Nothing he says makes any sense right?  It's all bad eh?But removal of Trump leaves you with Mike Pence who is truly a conservative and may end up being more distasteful to the left. Also, aren't we doing somewhat okay with economy, stock market, jobs, and North Korea? I'm centrist so I just wanna have discussion. Please discuss, don't downvote.Cool bro, I see you have a lot of time on your hands... but no need to get personal I'm sure you have many things you wouldn't want spilled on a public forum. I thought liberals were nice folk?! Quick questions:
1) OK great so you accept that our country is currently doing rather well. Fantastic. We can both agree on that. However, with all the good things happening... at what point would you start giving Trump credit for anything good that is happening in the country such as economy? 1 year from now? 2 years from? 3 years from now? or never?
2) Do you deny that the US has any hand in the NK situation so far? Such as the heavy economic sanctions one that we have placed with help from China?
3) I'm just trying to have a conversation and get a better sense of the rational of people like you. I'm certainly a centrist... but it's hardly my fault that the democrats have went off far left in recent years... and yeah I do agree with Dr. Peterson when he says that we should be less focussed on self victimization and identity politics. That's not a conservative issue that's just good old American mentality that we should pull up our boot straps and work hard in life.
4) So let me understand this correctly... you're so tribal in this moment of time ... that you would rather see demolition of our current government and absolute chaos to ensue .... than let the economy continue to do well, unemployment continue to dwindle, and foreign affairs looking better than they have in the last 10 to 15 years? So basically, party over country? That's you shtick?Thanks for your response. I'm glad we both agree that the economy is doing well. I agree that the economy was doing well before Trump, but if you look at the DJI the day of election and inauguration, there is a clear upward spike. That's just a fact. Do you deny that Trump has had nothing to do with this surge? At what point do we start giving him any credit.. if ever? So if frogs do rain, does Trump deserve credit then? Also Pence is far from ordinary conservative. He is extremely towards the right and may actually do some damaging change to our social fabric. He might attack gay marriage and marijuana legalization. Neither of us want that.I think it's too early to say anything. Stock market always goes up and then corrects and then goes up again. So it's not fair to use the just the stock market as a measure for economic progress. Other markers look good though.So this is a CNN money article from the day after the election which states that the "Dow soared 257 points" the night of the election: http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/09/investing/dow-jones-trump-wins-election/index.html so this disproves your point about it sinking when Trump was elected. I can't take the remainder of your post seriously because you just lost factual credibility.

What is Trump getting away with?The stock market always undergoes correction from time to time. And it certainly has historically always gone up again which is why DJI in the 1980s was ~2000 points and now is ~25000. The stock market surge under Trump is undeniable but I will give it to you that it shouldn't be the only marker for the current economic success... you can look act the GDP growth, unemployment, and everything points in a good direction. To say that it doesn't is simply a denial of facts.I never denied that it wasn't improving before Trump.. just that Trump has had a further positive influence on the growth. I personally give a lot of credit to Obama, but I'm also consistent will give credit to Trump if after enough time this growth continues. Don't you think that's fair?Yeah I don't know why people have a hate on him either.  I don't think he is a genius,  but I like many of the things he has written and said...but not all things.  Then we have the people who read a few things they don't agree with so then they paint a broad brush and say everything is bad.  Of course these people are no geniuses either.

 I believe Jordan was simply saying was that what might happen when you take a loyal bases President and impeach him. Not that his loyal base is correct, but rather what may happen. There will be an affect, he is wondering what that might be. I think he believes it won't be a positive one and perhaps be very negative, that there will be a large backlash of some sort. I think he is saying be prepared for that.  He is not saying he cares about their feelings ...just what might the reaction might be.

Then you also have the dumbfucks who paint him as a right wing nut when most of his views are left of center.Respect is earned,  not automatically given.I have watched and read many of the things he has spoken about,  I am left but not in any way far left and I consider him left or at the least center..  I do not see that opinion changing.

As soon as he came out against the radical left, the media started to paint him as a right wing and more people from the right started to support him. But I think he is moderate and got the tag only because he is speaking about the radical left. Then again, even left wingers who speak out against the radical left are painted as right wingers.You are clearly talking out of your ass.&gt;Cause he says or implies (then won't confirm or back up) that women are complicit for their own sexual assault when wearing makeup in the workplace.

He never said that at all. Are you talking about the Channel 4 interview?  He asked a question about that.  See that is exactly what I mean...people like to twist words to fit their own agenda.

&gt;This is basically you dismissing contrary things he says before someone brings them up.

Wrong.  I said some people.  That is truth.  If a person you admire can do no wrong and a person you dislike can do not right...that is called being a partisan hack.

&gt;A HUGE piece of evidence for me is that the vast majority of his fans are right wing 

You know why? Because he calls out the far left and they jump on the bandwagon of that and think he is on their side.  He also calls out far right but many of them are to dim to realize that.  JP is more a centrist and when you are that you get hate from both sides.  He is not the fucking devil here.Not what I am saying.  Be polite to everyone is not the same as respecting them.I am left,  always have been.  Many of the things he has said resonates with me. Super simple test,  if you piss off far right and far left,  you are doing something right.&gt;You're telling me you don't respect people you pass on the street?

I don't know them or what theyve done or not done. I will be polite to most people unless they do/say something that may change that.  I do not respect them,  not yet because like I said,  you will earn my respect...I just don't give it to you automatically. Being polite is a social norm, I can do that but respect is something a lot deeper.  I don't know if I explained that properly and it may be confusing to some,  if so it is unintended.

Respect definition:  a feeling of deep admiration for someone or something elicited by their abilities, qualities, or achievements. To admire (someone or something) deeply, as a result of their abilities, qualities, or achievements.Maybe I do need some introspection but I don't believe so.  I align with many of the policies and philosophy of the left.  I would be close to the center though,  a classical liberal perhaps.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism

&gt;they are owed as much respect as they have given others.

Strangers are due respect?  How do I know if they have given respect to others?Also take the test and see where you stand:

https://www.politicalcompass.org/test

I am indeed left of center and leaning Libertarian as well.I don't think he is panting them as blameless,  I did not get that out of it. I think he painted it as how will they react.

I think the right is generally a lot more hypocritical and also under educated.  I think the far left are generally social justice assholes who cannot understand different opinions and freedom of speech.&gt; but he's not calling out snowflakes on the right with nearly as much toughness.

Yeah I can agree with that.  He needs to be more equal in criticism on the right,  he does go after far left more and far right is just as bad if not worse.Hey there buddy... I'm not sure why you're continuing to fight a losing battle.. but I suppose I'll help educate you too. The question is... has Trump had a positive impact on the stock market? And any answer that isn't a resounding yes is just not accepting of the facts. Your "first of all" statement is a clear window into your own biases so anything you say or express simply has no credibility. Next, on Nov 9, 2016, the day after the election... did the Dow Jones not finish 250 points up or not? Yes or no? I will ask again... YES or NO? Because I can continue to provide [articles](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/us-markets.html) from sources you frequently use that will say that news of his presidency gave a boost to the stock market. Obviously the stock market will have fluctuated during the election night given the uncertainty of the outcome.The Dow Jones Index was around 18500 after he got elected. It is now ~25000. To say that he hasn't had a positive impact on the stock market, I repeat, is denying of the facts. If a candidate you supported had won the election and had this kind of impact on the stock market, you wouldn't be experiencing the kind of congnitive dissonance that you are now. I highly suggest you and people on your side grow up in your thinking (and demeanor, to be honest) and start looking at facts and start presenting and interpreting those facts in a way which reflects reality. Else you'll continue to lose centrist folk who believe in gay rights, gun control, and women's right to choose.        Easy, point to legislation he passed with tangible and proven effects towards the economy. Since he's barely passed any legislation so far it can be safely said that he can't take credit for other people's success.

Easy, the tax reform. Look at the list of companies that have opened up their wallets for employee bonuses and investments into manufacturing. Apple is just one example with their large $250 billion investment.

    The USA? Sure, the sanctions have been in the works for decades action against North Korea is hardly new nor innovative.

Oh good, glad we agree. It's just now NK is more willing to talk thanks to increase in those sanctions to a point where NK economy is faltering to a halt. Thank you president Trump? No? Wow. Shocker.

    They're barely center-left at best.


According to you... but then again your role model governments might be the extreme socialist left ones of Cuba and Venezuela... countries that are falling apart.
    
    No, I expect competency in my government. You don't reward idiocy and stupidity with continued control of the government, the man has so far shown himself of even the most basic aspects of government and its only through the badly damaged systems of checks and balances that he hasn't harmed the country too badly.
    
Yes, Trump's presidency is extremely unconventional and unlike anything we've seen before. But I still don't see any of your points made when our country seems to be in a far better place now than it was 2 years ago. Sure, thank you Obama for all his efforts in recovery of our economy, but also thank you to Trump for the continued boost and growth of our economy, the part he's played in stock market surge, continued decline of unemployement, further decimation of ISIS, NK willing to talk (probably his tweets about 'buttons' helped), wages are at their highest, regulations are being cut, companies are pouring back in (i.e., Apple, Chrysler),majority of Americans are receiving a tax cut, he’s removing barriers for space exploration, for a republican.. he’s actually willing to consider some sort of gun reform by increasing age-to-acquire assault weapons from 18 to 21, and again… heard from ISIS lately?

This is all I have to say. Please continue to criticize him for legitimate grievances, but also don't fail to give him credit where its due. I have many criticisms for him... but praise him when things are going well. Just like I did with Obama. Also, please don't make anymore personal attacks like you did in your original post. I haven't done that to you. Thanks.



Oh I am sure the market had a lot of variability during the events of the election night given the uncertainty... many people were concerned what an election means for our country. But as soon Trump, a pro economy candidate, was announced as president and when there was more certainty... the market has been on an upward trend where it has shot up from 18000 points to now almost 25000 points. I mean you can cherry pick my words and be a semantics nazi... but the point is simply this that Trump has been one of the main positive influences on the stock market. Lastly, your cute remarks aside, it would do you a world of good to acquire a more charming demeanor if in the future you feel like you have a disagreement with someone on the internet. Have a lovely day, buddy!Man you are totally biased and it really shows.  It just seems to be the case.  You can be really educated in many fields you don't hold a degree in,  you do not know his reading history and what he may have studied.  

Now do me a favour and argue the case as to why many people like him,  on the left and on the right. Or rather,  argue his side of it.Alright,  thanks man,  good post.  You didn't argue his side though,  it was just more accusations and negativity.So out of all the things he has published and or been interviewed about you really want to focus on cultural marxism/rightwing conspiracy which I could give two fucks about.  Probably because i do not know too much about it.

&gt;He thinks that feminism, civil rights, caring about people of color, lgbt issues, political correctness etc are communist plots to destroy western civilization

Jesus Christ,  talk about drama.   I do not get that at all.  I just am not getting that impression.  Just curious and it doesn't diminish what you are saying but are you a far left-wing sort of person?

Jp has a lot of stuff out there,  is any of it good in your opinion?I'm not felating anyone just discussing facts. Also, how is Trump the "most extreme right wing and divisive president in our lifetime?" Both Bush and Obama waged wars in the mideast and are responsible for 100,000+ deaths in that region. Trump has not done anything close to that. You wanna waste your $10 based on a mis-characterization of me go ahead and waste away. But I was extremely anti-Bush and anti-Iraq war.I will forward this to him so he can respond to you directly,  you cool with that?

Edit - also:

&gt;He is just like Alex Jones only knows how to speak eloquently

You want to compare him to Alex Jones and you think Jones speaks eloquently?  You are pretty dramatic with that one man.  I don't know enough on Marxism to comment on it so I wouldn't know if you are talking out your ass yourself.  I will discount JP's thoughts on all that but I totally get what he is saying on many topics.   Of all the stuff I have read and watched I have never seen him as anti-gay or anti-women or any of that.  I do however see people putting words and meaning into his words that he never said or alluded to.  It's really weird actually.

Edit 2 -  Through-out history haven't all the major political entities been represented in mass murder on a large scale?  It sure looks like they haveJesus Christ dude,  settle down.  I don't spread misinformation on Marxism and I am not a minion.  I am a left wing Atheist from Canada who is trying to figure out why some people hate him so much.  Because your posting really is bordering on hate and I am trying to get why.  You took a few courses in College on Marxism and you come off sounding like this guy (guy with pony tail):

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azM6xSTT2I0

I suppose I could speak to one of the Political Prof's on the Campus I work at to be more enlightened on the subject as I am now curious as to what they might have to offer.  Now quit being an asshole and have some patience.

Hey if it helps you sleep at night then keep believing the faux narrative you want. But the fact is the stock market closed higher on Nov 9 than it did on Nov 8. Overnight the volatility was understandable given the uncertainty and unpredictability of election night. Trump was by far the better candidate for stock market than Hillary Clinton. The only thing that is losing is your belief system that Trump is detrimental for the world which as seen today thanks to NK/SK, he's not. But as the journey song goes, "don't stop believing," .. bud.I'm interested to hear what Farrow says about the developments in Korea.Oh SNAP!!! Bill made the Sinatra joke!The only thing worse than being Woody Allen’s son would be being his daughter. This is why I like Bill. He isn’t scared to go **there** no matter who is on. I feel like Bill is allowing this argument so he can slam it in a one liner as fake.Great piece on Roseanne.  I hope she listens.That would make her Lord of the Trolls.#metoo and feminism. He was a fucking retard. I’m with you. I wish he would have knocked the shit out of him. I'm really glad the panel stayed on point discussing the very important issues of Fox and Friends and rightfully ignored the completely irrelevant news of South Korea and North Korea shaking hands and calling an official end to Korean War and progressing closer to denuclearization.Why was there no mention of crazy Kanye West supporting our racist president? both in the opening monologue and the panel discussions thereafter.Bill sounds like the out of touch old man he is when he talks about Hugh Hefner.  He wants to give Hefner credit for helping progress the sexual revolution, but when it comes to analyzing the negative consequences of that revolution, Hefner is a private citizen beyond reproach.  The fact is Playboy did not just celebrate sex; it objectified women and treated them as prizes to be won in the consumer culture its pages glorified. 

On Aziz, Ronan was totally right. The article led to a controversy, and a very important discussion about consent, and it did not kill his career. His show is still on Netflix and I still see Netflix using it in their promos for romantic comedies. I wish Ronan had said:  Aziz has millions of collars, he'll be just fine. Let's talk instead about the women who were violated, assaulted, or just disrespected, rather than letting the conversation be entirely driven by whether powerful rich men have to face consequences for their actions. I don't know how you can say black people voting for Trump would be voting against their self-interest given the lowest black unemployment in history with rising wages. Other than this, what other policies has Trump proposed so far that would go against the interest of black people? The facts do not add up to support your claims.Hey is it raining frogs yet? Because I think it rained some frogs at the DMZ yesterday.So stupid shit Trump does is more important than discussing a historic meeting of NK and SK leaders?Yep, I agree. But enjoy being downvoted in this sub for making reasonable points.That's cute. I mean it's really gotta be impacting you psychologically to be this wrong on such a consistent basis. The peace talks and progress towards denuclearization is well underway my friend. Why aren't you more optimistic and hoping for a good outcome? I would bet a million that you would rather live in a world where NK doesn't denuclearize so you can continue your brainless Trump bashing than live in one where it does and Trump wins the nobel peace prize (and win on merit than for the colour of his skin).I'm not going to defend Trump's silly antics. But he did impose tougher than before sanctions which has forced NK to at least come to the table and discuss denuclearization and peace talks. Yes there is a history of them doing similar behavior, but have they ever made such symbolic gestures as declaring an end to peace talks? Yesterday was beautiful. It's just the vibe I get from this sub and Trump haters is that he can save an old granny from burning house and people would say that "he didn't do shit" or that "he got lucky." And you may not think I'm a centrist - that's fine. But it's complete and utter opposition and hatred, and using double standards is definitely something that will drive centrists away from the left.You say he's right wing but fail to mention how. How is he any more right wing than the Bushes? And why is he divisive? You're making these claims and making accusations but where is the evidence? Again, are you therefore denying that the recent increase in sanctions on North Korea had anything to do with it? How do you explain how NK changed its stance from testing missiles close to home and just weeks later are not talking peace? Yes South Koreans have visited but there hasn't been a bigger step like this one before.Still no mention of actual policies that Trump has implemented which suggest he is the "most" right wing president ever. China tightened the belt due to US pressure. Do you not know that?*crickets* they won't have a response but they'll happily downvote you because making a decision to click a mouse button is the most their brain will allow for.Good, I'm glad you got the necessary break which I am sure you need more frequently these days.Didn't realize a video from 12 years ago is the same thing as an actual imposed law, restriction or policy. Keep trying. You may not find the right answer, but you just might escape the TDS.Hilarious. The WHCD is not a set for that room...it's for all the Americans NOT in that room. She did great.It's not about appealing to people under 40. It's about discussing current events and the recent infusion of Kanye into politics is both unique and unprecedented. He's not an alcoholic to anyone's knowledge, just a demented looney tune who says 9/11 like he somehow prevented it or did anything to clean it up besides fucking his cousin.  All Giuliani did was clean up porno stores in midtown and wreck nightlife.  The city was getting safer on its own but he takes credit anyway.I hate the use of the word 'snowflake'.  I attribute it to right wing idiots clutching their pearls over people not agreeing with them.I wonder if the issue with miguided SJW leftists is as pronounced as Bill and right wing media make it or it's just a perception people draw based upon a few extreme Twitter posts and some journalists fluffing hollywood readers?           

           
I honestly think the message for some of us gets fucked up and blurred by people who want 100% open borders and immediate amnesty for all illegals vs. people who want tight but compassionate border security (through technology and personnel, not a stupid wall) but a more open and fair immigration process that is expedited by about 90% along with a path to citizenship for people here at present but none on a go-forward save for people who come legally.  I also think we should take more refugees as a direct result of our military interventions which would help the people we hurt and cut down on our addiction to foreign wars.I think he will be rightfully impeached but not forced out due to the high bar in the Senate.        

I also think he will just leave when it's time at the end of 2.5 more years but not before being a little bitch and screaming about the deep state fake media he's now going to take on from Trump TV, his new channel wherein he'll complain until he dies 2 years after that resulting in a massive funeral at Trump Moscow where George Soros will have certainly paid an exhorbitant sum for Putin to dispatch some girls to pee on his grave.Women are judged by a different standard than men.  That doesn't mean women, especially powerful women like Pelosi, are perfect or should not be subject to criticism. I don't much about UBI but I was surprised to see a presumably liberal political leader espouse the idea, as previously I had only heard about it from Charles Murray.Kind of surprised that Bill didn't do more to tie incels to a lot of the things going on. Many of the people.in Charlottesville and even T_D are likely incels. I am not saying all are but I am saying many are. 

The problem here isn't that they are bad people because they are virgins. The problem is that they have a sense of entitlement. They believe that sex is just something that they should hey because they are special and "nice guys". 

This likely goes just beyond sex. They probably think they are entitled to their dream job, good home, lots of money, etc. not because they actually did anything to deserve it but because they are special. 

Trump essentially made them feel special. Made them feel justified in their feelings and aglltelp them that they are absolutely owed all of that stuff. You don't have it because minorities, PC police, feminazis, liberalism, etc. stole it. 

Obviously this is a generalization. But it is true. Idk, seems like Bill would have tried to make the connectionShe didn't say anything what wasn't true for the most part. And that is the problem. The right didn't want to be attacked nor did the left or the media. She shined a light on their issues and now they are madI have only run into a handful in my life but it is the same story. Their life sucks and they enjoy playing the victim. Rather than taking responsibility, they go ok the offense.I think of the Joker who has two ferries rigged with explosives.  On one side you have 26% of the country filled with average people and the other you have the other 24% of people who don't like to abide by society's rules and are generally angry renegades who wanted to blow up the other boat but some guy (Rosenstein) decided to throw the detonator out the window because he wouldn't play Joker's game.        

The nonvoters are safe in Gotham until Joker decides to blow up another hospital.True. I mean the internet is definitely one of those double edged sword. There are tremendous benefits to it but it also allows for bad things. As Bill said, we have all been incels before. Also, not every man who has a had time getting laid or is a virgin is an incel. 

Incels are people who have a hard time getting laid but rather than deal with it, they get angry. The problem with the internet is that now they can find each other and reinforce their delusions.

I think that is what older generations have a hard time with. These people always existed but they were the crazy dude in town. Now they have the ability to create a network
Yep. That is largely it. The incel movement is part of a larger issue and that is entitlement. There is a group of men in this world who were told from a young age that they were special. The reality is, your mommy might think you are special but the rest of the world doesn't give a shit.  No one taught this to these men. 

They believe that women are supposed to find them special too and just follow their lead. They also think that jobs are just supposed to be lining up for them. They should have an amazing house by 25, and so on.

None of this is happening and it manifests in them. Some become White Nationalists, some become incels. Some just have bouts of depression and withdraw.  Once the PWC-audited and Congress-investigated Clinton Foundation came up he should have stood up and walked to the panel leaving the guy sitting there.That's so funny I forgot about the $1.4 trillion tax cut that went to paying dividends to shareholders which had **0** qualifiers attached to it (create jobs/increase wages/pay bonuses) and was just a free giveaway for NOTHING.  Enjoy your $10.00 a week.  I hope you don't live on the coasts because your taxes will go up astronomically.  I also hope you don't live in the middle of the country because if the coasts say fuck you and leave then you have none of our welfare dollars to see you through.You have no idea how the tax code works or is supposed to work.  You want job creation?  Put it in the bill and require it to qualify for the cut.  Instead companies did exactly what they're supposed to do with free money and put it back into the shareholders with dividends and increased their power with stock buybacks which only benefits the wealthiest Americans.           
                     Killer Mike SLAYED Bill over supporting Bernie over Hillary.Thanks Obama who bailed us out of 2008 and Bush's horrible tax/regulatory policies which Trump is just repeating on steroids.  The market contraction we experienced was made thrice as bad due to the actions that preceded it in 2002-2007.           
                       

Only the dumbest people in America think that the effective tax rate is equivalent to the corporate tax rate (Donald Trump among them).  Many corporations pay 0 tax while reaping in 10s of billions in profit.  Lowering taxes without qualifiers just leads to more outsourcing to cheap foreign labor (especially with the GSM factor) and increased automation.

The trade deals are and have been net neutral at worst.            
Anyway, if you want to continue this conversation when you're not high and drunk (if that ever happens), maybe we should.&gt;Why should people especially of colour give up their guns against a militarized police force? I'd say more people should be armed when facing the threats they do in your country. 

The state will always have bigger and better guns. Killer Mike is genuinely dangerous. His spurious arguments linking gun legislation to racism has the potential to be very effective. It's never sustainable in the short term.  When the market does contract, Trump will blame the FBI somehow.  It's astounding how ignorant he is of even basic concepts related to running the country.That was a hilarious moment. Killer Mike keeping it real on Real Time. Bill needs a little humility every now and then and I think that surprised him. Notice he tried to push past it but some in the audience clapped for it.What is the K word?It should’ve never been a big deal to begin with. Like Killer Mike's point. One thing white America doesn't understand is what it is like to be black in America. The reality is that the vast majority of black people are harmless. The hood is as dangerous as a trailer park in rural Alabama. 

That being said, a lot of white America (not all) believe that black people are inherently violent and pose a threat to them. Studies show that they get treated more harshly in schools than white counter parts for similar behavior and what not. 

Black parents have a special conversation with their kids about how to behave around police because they know that if they just move funny, it is a bullet in the back because black people are dangerous and the cop will claim he felt threatened. 

If a black person is killed, people will go out of their way to make it sound like they deserved it. Philando Castille wasn't breaking any laws that deserved a death penalty. He thought he was being safe by letting the cop know that he had a gun. Had the gun just dropped out or the cop seen it,  he may have been shot. However, didn't help. What happens in the media? They go over how many times he was stopped by the police for moving violations in the past. Basically it is to show that black people deserve what they get. 

I am not saying cops are all evil. However, how many of us fuck up at our job on a given day, week, month, year? Cops are human too. The difference is that when they mess up, someone dies. There needs to be better training of cops but also we need a "come to Jesus" moment where we realize that these biases still exist in the collective consciousness of America and we need to rid ourselves of it.I had never heard that word before. Thank you for answering my question. I live in a small town in rural Tennessee and to be honest I have never even met a Jewish person. I had never heard that one. 

I know most people assume the south is racist, and I can’t speak for anywhere but where I live and the people I work with and know, but race relations are great here. Man I loved Patrice. 
Still love Louis CK. 

British? I only ask because of the way you spell favourite?Ya. Oh well. One thing I have noticed is anytime you talk about race, there is a part of society that internalizes it. Basically they feel that they are being blamed. 

What I am saying is that something is wrong with society. Chris Rock used to have a joke about how there was no white man who would trade places with him, and he is rich. 

Largely true, being black in America is no fun. I am half black and i dont quite look it. I always wonder if I should lie about what I am or own it on dating apps or whatever. http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voting-resources/voting-california/who-can-vote-california/

Illegal immigrants can't vote in California. They can apply for a special driver's license that can't be used as ID for voting though. 

My guess is that Duncan Hunter saw a "get out to vote" event of Hispanics and just assumed they were illegal.I disagreed with that part. But I agreed with his sentiment about how blacks are treated. And hey, if white people believe they need guns to protect themselves, they need to extend the same logic to black peopleI agree. A black person abiding by the law and open carrying is signing his own death certificate. It is sad that black people aren't practically allowed the same life white people are in a practical sense.Mmmm maybe. But they show white people have had more leniency with cops. 

And I am also talking about a black man open carrying. Minding his own business, going to the store carrying a gun (legally). He would likely be shot by a cop or more likely Bubba thinking he is a cop. 

Yep. It also shows how racist the Republicans are. I guarantee there are no booths that say "illegals! Vote here" or whatever. Also not like undocumented immigrants wear a special band or tshirt or whatever to identify then on the streets. There is no real way to tell if someone is undocumented by just looking at them. 

Basically they see a bunch of Hispanic people and asshole me they must be illegal because apparently Hispanics don't belong here. California WAS Mexico. There are families that have been there for generations, maybe even longer than white people. 

We do need to call out the fact that Republicans are scared shitless of the demographic change but rather than trying to change their messaging to get minorities to vote Republican, they just want to suppress it.Yep. I have an immigrant friend, been here for maybe 8 years, working, paying taxes, contributing, can't vote.This is a show about ideas, not window dressing. I find there is a beautiful diversity of opinion, ideas and examination of policy. I don’t judge ideas based on what color or gender the mouth was that uttered them- I just judge the idea. Conversely, a great idea is not nullified because it was expressed by someone of a politically inconvenient race or gender.Has any other guest been on 3 times in 4 months before?

More diversity is better... of ideas, gender, race and although Bill hates it; religion I met someone who works at HBO and asked him about this. "Why doesn't Real Time show up until the next day?"

"Well it's up by 7 in the morning."

"Right but why not immediately?  Like YouTube?"

"Well our tech isn't there yet."

Are you shitting me?  You're HBO. You can't compete with the uploading capacities of the Logan Brothers?He’s right. Nothing is going to happen to Trump. Focus on 2020I do too. She is a sad example of how thousands of Americans think and behave. I believe in free speech, but our basic rights are not free- they come with a cost and more importantly, a civic responsibility. Freedom of speech is not freedom to spew hateful vitriol.  At some point it will occur to Roseanne how many millions of dollars this devotion to hate has cost her. It will be interesting to know who she blames then. If she can see then that she can only blame herself, then I will be interested in hearing her out. But until then, I’m happy to not think of her, or see her ever again- because there’s not enough room in this world for her crazy patchwork of hate. We need to be cleansed of this scourge- it is truly poisonous and America has swallowed a fatal dose. To paraphrase Bill a bit "Who cares what 3 jag-offs on Twitter think, who have the combined following power of their moms?"........6 years after.Well Bill Maher was making a dumb joke. Also, calling black people gorillas has been a long standing racial slur. 

This was also well before Trump even ran for President so I wouldn't say that he did this to the President.

Context. Trump was being a bigot (surprise surprise) and offering Obama something like $1M if he can provide his birth certificate. Note, the money wasn't going to be given to Obama but  rather donated to any charity of Obama's choice like "inner city youth" (Trump's  words). 

Obama largely because of he did (I wouldn't give Trump any more attention than needed). Trump then ups the money. Eventually Obama releases it (not on Trump's deadline) and then without missing a beat, Trump makes the same deal this time he wants Obama to release his academic records. You know, cause there is no way a half black man can get to an elite school like a white man can on their grades. No, they have their daddy pay for it like good old Trump. 

Anyway, this was so ridiculous that Bill Maher made a joke that if Trump can prove to Bill Maher that he is not the son of an orangutan, he will give Trump $1M. Something that is obviously a joke because humans and orangutans can't mate. Well the man who would be president actually mails Maher his birth certificate to show that he fathered by Fred Trump and not an orangutan. He then demanded the money. Trump wound up suing Maher. 

In this context, Maher was making fun of Trump for being a dumbass (well before he was president so don't give us this "respect the office" junk) and Trump kind of proved that he was one. 

Roseanne just randomly calls a black woman a jihadist monkey. I think Roseanne knew. Valerie Jarrett from Iran and is African American (despite being lighter skin). Calling her a cross between Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes is pretty on the nose to be a coincidence. 

It is hard to say it changes anything because her comment it too particular.Hard to say. For one, we know he isn't a quarter black.  Context matters. If we discovered today that he was then no, we don't retroactively punish Bill Maher based  on a joke using knowledge available then. 

Also, it isn't just about skin color. Black is a race but it is also a culture. She is a paler black person, they do exist. However it doesn't change the fact that she is black. 

Well also Sweden is different as it doesn't have the history regarding black people that America does. Remember, for the longest time we had the "one drop policy".  While the full extent of that rule is gone, remnants still exist. 

Let's say you are mixed white and whatever. Most people see you as whatever "muddies the waters". Hell even from a legal perspective, we only recently started allowing people to list more than one race on legal forms. 

You could be black, adopted into a white family and never have any exposure to African American culture but still be seen as African American in the USA. You can be mixed like myself, raised in white culture, not connecting to African American culture until adulthood but still be seen as African American. Or you can be an albino black like one I know but still be African American culturally.

Yes race is a social construct but as a society we still out a ton of weight into it. Valerie Jarrett looking white doesn't all of the sudden ease what Roseanne did or give people a pass. He'll Valerie Jarrett didn't even attempt to hide that she was actually African American. She takes pride in some of the things her family has accomplished (look up her lineage, very interesting). 
Very fair point. Black and African American aren't the same. I was speaking specifically in the scope of US views and not the global which was my error.Starts with...

&gt;As an Englishman living in the USA, I am respectful, I hope, of most opinions expressed by Americans because ultimately I am here as a guest.  Not a citizen. I have my views but in the main, I keep them to myself.  Ultimately if I don’t like the politics of the Nation I live in I should just get the hell out of Dodge.

And yet...

He might not be a SJW but he's a self-loathing semblance of a man. The person he describes, "old, white, privileged" is in fact exactly what he is. This is especially ironic because according to what he says, his thoughts and ideas should be immediately considered invalid and inconsequential based on his age, skin color, and size of his bank account. Hillary didn't rig shit. Bernie didn't rig shit. It's politics.

Obama won his first election by keeping the primary opponent incumbent off the ballot on a technicality. Did he rig it? No, he used the system within the rules in a way that not everyone appreciated. It's politics.

edit: And for the record I'm talking about Obama's first election ever as a State rep.I want Mooch V. Sanders + someone to throw shit at Mooch about his shady business dealings and him to flip out.          
It's too bad he didn't have Roseanne and a BLM activist on.  I really like drama, in case you couldn't tell.The shitflinging is what makes the show.  I hate when all the panelists get up there and talk like they're on CNN.  "Well I disagree with your statement but I'll defend to the death your right to say it."  Audience = Flying in the wings of Lunesta waiting for New Rules (can't use Ambien anymore unfortunately).        
          
It's guaranteed Roseanne is going to come up and Bill is going to talk about calling Trump an Orangutan and probably bemoan the sensitivity of everyone under the age of 42.5 Definitely no comparison.  I think Bill will bring up the Sam Bee thing for comparison.  I think if Sam Bee had called her "Bitch" or "Idiot" or "Moron", the White House still would've jumped on it.  It's all they have to avoid calling out Roseanne for a nasty and racist tweet which even Roseanne has called on people not to defend and admitted she was wrong (right before she reposted 500 people excusing her actions and some conspiracy theories for good measure).              
              
That, or Trump complaining like a little bitch that people said mean things about him.  He has to know 100% that he's courting racists and white supremacists/Nazis by refusing to ever question them and deflecting to other things.Can't find it, but here's a synopsis:

Guests: Journalist David Frum, comedian Eddie Izzard, author Gore Vidal, former governor of Vermont Howard Dean, businessman Russell Simmons 

Topics: Madrid bombings, renewal of the Patriot Act, young voters, voting machines
Bill palling up with Roseanne, coupled his dropping the N-bomb recently, would probably force HBO to cancel him. Bret Stephens works for MSNBC and the New York Times?  Are you fucking kidding me?  Why do liberal institutions keep giving a voice to these phonies?  They have no constituency.  Honestly, Roseanne is a much more honest representative of right-wing politics: conspiratorial, crazy, and racist. 

His idea that the way to win vote is through appealing to civility and bipartisanship is so dumb he should be kicked off Pundit Island for the rest of his days. &gt; Hillary didn't rig shit. It's politics

Cheap cynicism masquerading as sophisticated realpolitick. Cheap insult masquerading as a response. "I'm With Her"

Just kidding. Honestly I think Bill missed the point with the slogan thing. What's more important is having a message that resonates, with actual substance, something the Hillary campaign did not have (except "at least she's better than Trump" which we know did not work)

Highlight the actual issues the party wants to stand for:

Universal healthcare
Free College
Raising the Minimum Wage
etc.

That is what Trump was talking about (even though he was lying, of course). You’ve confused diversity of thought with a private business giving a platform to irrelevant jabbering. It depends on why they voted for Trump. If they voted Trump simply because they didn't like Hillary than maybe. If it is because they were worried about money than maybe. 

However, the type like the alt-righr, people who matched at Charlottesville, t_D, then you are right. They likely can't be won to Democratic side because they see this as a fight for white men vs everyone else. This is why immigration and refugees are such a hot topic issue for them. It is code for "let's keep America from getting too brown". 

Looking at pure statistics, illegal immigrants and refugees don't cause any additional safety risks for Americans and don't cost us too much addition. If anything, they are a net positive on society as a whole. The real reason Alt-right is worried is like you said, demographic change. 

Rather than trying to win the Trump voter, worry about what the Democratic party stands for. Those who are in line with the message will follow. Those who are all about demographic changes, fuck em.The climate change denialist talking about “core values”. lol ok. Love Trump's HateI’ve never gone from “nope” to “yes” so fast for someone on a talk show before. He’s got some mad charisma. Interesting guy Restore DemocracyI just want to know what he said about the renewal of the Patriot Act. Do you by chance know what was said about that topic?

I've looked for episodes, clips, and transcripts to no avail. It's like the episode never happened! D;March 19, 2004. Guests: Journalist David Frum, comedian Eddie Izzard, author Gore Vidal, former governor of Vermont Howard Dean, businessman Russell SimmonsSadly not. It's a good 5 years before I started watching Real Time. There aren't any YouTube videos of it, as far as I can tell &amp; it predates a lot of internet file-sharing sites of questionable legality. Sad to say, the only way you'd be able to find it, is if you wrote to HBO.damn. for sure, thank you!Love Bernie, but I remember 2016 differently. I remember the mainstream media latching onto Clinton’s criticisms like they were settled facts and Bernie having to spend a lot of time defending why he was (ostensibly) weak on guns and explaining how he’d pay for his programs. 

We can’t overestimate how deeply the mainstream media wants to suggest Bernie and Trump are mirror images of each other. That will be the overpowering media narrative if Bernie wins: two brash New Yorkers presiding over cults of personality. Whither the civil centrists of an imagined yesteryear?Roseanne needs no defense. She is who she is. Whatever people want to call her, to me she’s just an idiot who can’t keep her mouth shut when it’s in her own best interest and the interests of 200 plus cast and crew- people with families and mortgages. You see, it’s her reckless, selfish narcissism that offends me. She’s no different than Donald Trump, it’s all about her. I don’t give a fuck what she really thinks about anything. I never watched her show and I could care less about it. But I really hate these reckless egomaniacs that believe there’s a public out there that desperately wants to know what they think. Goodbye, Roseanne. Have fun wallowing in the millions of dollars you made as a comedy star. You can fuck off now. Buh-bye!Yeah, everyone probably thinks I'm super-racist, but it was the arrogant-sounding name that turned me off. And since I can cite Gilbert Gottfried [precedent,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a0L1Xx2kMM) Maherians must forgive me.

But man, wow. Brilliant guy, hysterical, very likeable. Not arrogant at all.Honestly they’re all too specific. The genius of Trump’s slogan is that it’s whatever you want it to be. Assumes Americans have a higher recall of history than they actually do. [Longer clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugjzWuBLgic)It depends. Sometimes he makes a good point but you gotta sift through the useless dialog to get to itOntario eh? I'm kayaking across the lake, meet me at Tim Horton's.I can't believe Maher just wished for the recession just so he can see Trump fail. I hate Trump as much as anyone but Bill Maher just wished harm against his own country and the economic livelihood of the millions of its own citizens to satisfy his hatred for Trump... Disgusting.Never even heard of the guy until I checked Reddit. Then again, Reddit hypes every celebrity death.A recession might hurt some people but it helps people with significant savings and no debt. What about those people?We don’t really need to accept this horseshit narrative of Blacks vs. Bernie. As usual, people who make sound decisions are punished.Consider someone who racks up as much debt as possible, and buys a house beyond their means. If the market continues to rally, they can flip the house and turn a nice profit on their gamble. If the market tanks, they are bankrupt. Why should I worry about their "economic livelihood" given that reckless decision?

That example pretty much describes the late 2000s financial crisis.It reminds me of liberals who rip on products like Simply Orange for the crime of using too much "math and engineering" in its supply chain despite being made entirely of oranges.

But because it wasn't squeezed in the cunt of some dirty local farmer, oh those evil corporations!I want it to work, which is more than you can say. Identity politics in a nutshell.A few weeks ago they had Sally Kohn, although she would fall into the category of "recites a laundry list of grievances for applause."I do not see a point in having an audience, its not like there is any interaction going on between them and panel, beyond aforementioned applause and laughter, which I hate, because it feels like a laugh track in a comedy, telling you what to feel in a given moment.Either get a balanced audience or no audience. But Bill's opening monologue may also need to be scraped.Recessions are actually somewhat necessary in the same way Forest fires are necessary. Forest grows too wild with too much underbrush, naturally a forest fire will ignite and burn that underbrush to help maintain the health of the forest. 

The same is with an economy. The problem is when a forest fire goes out of control and burns down the entire forest rather than just handling some underbrush. When a recession goes out of control, then we have an issue (see 2007/8 for reference)Bill is a stand up comedian. An audience is essential for the show to work. The audience also serves to keep the guest panelists honest. I think his point (badly expressed), is that a recession is inevitable, at this point. Bill just hopes that it hits BEFORE Trump has a chance to slip away.I cringed so hard at that moment. It was bad.Fair point. I always thought he DID represent liberalism, albeit with some libertarian tendencies and an unhealthy fixation on Muslims. Liberal or not, those comments are fucking cancer.Unfortunately I don’t remember any other guests, but I do remember that the man had long hair, mostly grey, and glasses. He anywhere from 45-55 years old He and Ann Coulter have a mutual dislike of George Will, I remember from an old show. But George is a pro, so he's unlikely to hang it over Bill. Should be an interesting segment.Disappointed to see there was little to no serious discussion about North Korea in a week that saw a historic summit... even Michael Weiss hinted to it but it was never discussed. Shocking. I guess anything slightly pro-Trump won't be discussed on this show anymore.At the very least, we get the remains of our kias/mias from the Korean war. You may not be personally affected by it, but those of us who lost our family members in the war are pleased with this agreement.It was part of the [signed agreement](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/12/politics/korean-war-pow-mia-agreement-donald-trump-kim-jong-un/index.html) at the summit. Nobody here knows about it because it wasn't discussed at the show!

EDIT: To answer your question, there definitely are remains still there as the US has previously tried to get those remains but those efforts were suspended due to safety concerns... as highlighted in the CNN source I linked.

EDIT 2: No one is disputing the fact that NK may very well renege or act dishonest in all of this... but a discussion is still worth having where we talk about whether this meeting was a move in the right direction or the status quo of NK being a threatening nuclear force was safer and better for the world. A discussion I wish last night's show would have had rather than "Trump is bad and Russia and all that.." and then Bill wonders why his poll numbers keep going up and why pro-Trump republicans keep winning their elections.And that's a lie too.What I'm telling you, is that that is a LIE.  She represents MAYBE 10% of Republicans.  Trump has a ~90% approval rating among them.

They are lying to your face and smiling to the ballot.Glad he talked about cops. Now I believe the orivken is three parts. One, as he mentioned, the wrong people apply for the position. I bet there are some people who do it truly to be positive but many do it because they want to have power. They were great in high school, everyone went to college and they fizzled out b

Second, poor training. Basically, we tell cops anytime they feel threatened, they are justified in taking a life. So basically they can get away with murder if they bitch out. Yes a 12 year old was so scary!

Third, inherrent bias. Society tells us the black people are just naturally more dangerous than others and when you believe that, you are more likely to take someone down. 

The problem with society (especially the right) is that they believe cops are infallible and any who do something wrong to a citizen were justified. Cops are like any other job, some amazing people, many shitty.I doubt the Democrats can come up with someone as his as TrumpIt sounds like you are underinformed and would suggest that you do some self-study about current events.No need to get sassy. Here you go buddy: [US Sanctions against NoKo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_North_Korea). A quick google search will answer most of your questions.

&gt; On 21 September 2017 President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 13810 allowing the United States to cut from its financial system and/or freeze assets of any companies, businesses, organisations and individuals trading in goods, services or technology with North Korea. Also any aircraft or ship upon entering North Korea is banned for 180 days from entering the United States. The same restriction applies to ships which conducted ship to ship transfers with North Korean ships. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated that "Foreign financial institutions are now on notice that going forward they can choose to do business with the United States or North Korea, but not both." A statement from the White House said “Foreign financial institutions must choose between doing business with the United States or facilitating trade with North Korea or its designated supporters.”[17][18] On 25 September 2017, the US Treasury barred the entry of North Korean nationals to the United States.[19]
Following the abduction of a South Korean fishing vessel, additional sanctions were ordered by the US Treasury on 26 October 2017, following a culmination of 'flagrant' rights abuses including executions, torture, and forced labor. Seven individuals and three North Korean entities were affected by the sanctions.[20]Climate-deniers’ argument has now evolved to: “yes climate change is man-made, but we don’t know the effect it will have with precision and therefore we should avoid radical changes to our economy.” Except it somehow never leads them to think IT COULD BE WORSE. Or to prepare for that worst-case scenario, just in case. It’s such a horseshit, bad-faith argument, and they usually get away with it. Bill half-called out Will on it,  but not with the vehemence the situation demands. You realize there is more than one person on the internet, and that not all these replies are from me, right?&gt; The irony of calling someone a liar while misrepresenting what they said is truly beautiful. Well done sir. You've reached peak ignorance.

And now you'll lie about having lied, while accusing the people who caught you in a lie, of having lied themselves.

You just can't help yourself, can you?&gt; No again you're misrepresenting. Do you guys have any desire to take someone's argument in good faith? 

Its kind of hard when none of the arguments you present are ever in good faith.  &gt; They don't have any proof that climate change can be solved.

They don't have any proof that cancer can be solved.  WE STILL WORK TOWARDS A CURE.  Its a magnificent piece of fascistic drivel to say that just because you cannot imagine a solution, none exists, or that just because a problem cannot be 100% mitigated, we should not bother to mitigate it at all.

My biggest problem with people like you is that you think you're a terrific liar, and that you can just bullshit your way through life.  You don't realize what a terrible scam-artist you are.Seemed like horseshit.  If there was any validity to it,Trump would have Rudy Nosferatu wheeled out on the cable shows to make it. Trump is literally TWO South Park characters. Seeing who's President, I think we can dispel with the notion that only candidates taken seriously can go far. Let's see what Minnesota has to say. Also, keep in mind their last Senator was an SNL comedian.&gt; Someone said he sounds like Mr. Garrison which is 100% accurate. 

He has a health condition that affects his facial muscles and speech. 

edit: https://twitter.com/rwpusa/status/969309792299872256?lang=enWas it Dilbert creator Scott Adams?Omg, YES! Thank you so much!!! As soon as I saw your post I pulled up his interview to make sure (though I thought what you suggested sounded right), and yes; it’s him! He is a trained hypnotist and that’s how he got into the subject. 

Thank you so much u/ThroneofGames! I can’t tell you how much I appreciate it!!Well not the rich part. He's black so that's great! I like diverse panels. I'm generally okay with anyone as long as the panel is representative of the wonderful diversity of our nation.Ugh, Neera Tanden is such fraud. The "Center for American Progress" actively fights against Progressive candidates across the nation and totally shit on Bernie Sanders and she continues to now. She'll probably find some way to blame Bernie Sanders tonight for Trump.YES. Exactly. She makes me sick. She should head the "Center for Centrism/Center-Right Democrats".Didn't Portugal legalize all drugs, and the rates of overdose and death dropped dramatically?Absolutely. Finally good to see an actual conservative rather than conservative-apologists. I hope he is either the first interview or on the panel.He stated frequently that he gave Obama’s campaign $1 million- through the DNC, I think. He spoke of it when he was trying to book Obama on his show before he left office.He has mentioned it a few times on the show. In fact, he had Julian Assange as a guest back in 2016 and he tried to "expose" that he was a large donor to Obama and Bill was like "ya, everyone knows I donated that". 

He even did like one of those giant novelty checks at the end of his comedy special to donate to Obama. The right media got so upset saying that Obama should return the money.Wow, completely didn’t believe you but I looked it up and it turns out you’re right. Who would’ve thought? He’s never mentioned it 5 times during every show since! I don't understand how you can be black and support this president.May I respectfully ask (because I don't know) how that comment is misogynistic? Is the fact that he called her 'broad'?What do you mean? Trump is against black people right?Thanks... but if he had said about some male panelist.. "that dude/bloke/guy/[insert other informal male reference] was completely annoying" .... would that be sexist? I just honestly want to know... not trying to pick a fight.

EDIT: I guess I didn't understand that 'broad' is a historically sexist term. My bad.
EDIT 2: I still think there's a double standard though. Many comments in this sub-reddit have referred to men with insulting/derogatory adjectives but sexism is never raised there.Um... Charlottesville... hello!?Ah, thank you. THAT's what we should do. Thank you for the correction.Trump sided with white supremacists therefore he's anti-black.By that logic, calling someone a dick is misandrist.

So let's just admit there's a double standard and move on.We don't want another lecture from Ice Cube, now do we?If you're dumb enough to shoot yourself with a gun, you can probably just file it under natural selection.You guys have a lousy sarcasm detectorIve watched Maher for years and rewatched some interviews over the weekend. Regardless of context, I think Maher brings the donation up a lot and it plays into the smug character most viewers believe him to be. No... I'm just pointing out the double standard. We should be just as cautious when it's sexism towards men as we are when it's sexism towards women.He needs to get her, Tulsi Gabbard, Bernie and Elizabeth Warren on the show at the same time. It would be the most awesome Progressive show ever (which is probably why it wouldnt happen).SAW Michael Moore at a taping a few years ago.....He's always great and gets the crowd going. Bradley Whitford is also awesome. I am curious how this panel works out."Anyone who didn't vote for Hillary..." -Bill Maher   


Maybe the Democrats shouldnt have cheated out Bernie, and then put up the ONE Democrat that could lose against a Con-Man like Trump. Bernie is a FDR Progressive. Hillary's best friend is Henry Kissinger.  This shaming of Progressives started during the primaries of the Democratic party. Why not heal the wound by putting Bernie Sanders on the ticket? Democrats deserved to lose in 2016. My fear is they don't understand the voting base is tired of their shit. Bernie won in the states that mattered. and he was constantly cheated out of votes due to superdelegates.He's had only Democrats or even only Republicans on the panel many of times. I'd love a panel of Progressive  all stars.Yes, it would!No person who is pro-Bernie calls themselves a "Bernie Bro". I call bullshit. It's like you embracing being called an "asshole".
He is in the context of Conservatives. Unfortunately, conservatives have slowly been devolving intellectually. This lowers the bar for intellectualism. You don't have to make an intelligent argument to win over today's conservative. The weird ass double standard Ben Shapiro has upseta me. He will only join the Democratic Party if they stop with their mean rhetoric essentially. The Republicans have been assholes this whole time. The Alt-right essentially endorsing neo-nazi, "lock her up", Trump encouraging violence during the campaign, all the shit said about Obama. 

He needs to be genuine and say he disagrees with the policies of Democrats and not use this civility argument.Supporting a guy like Trump because you like his policy accomplishments is like endorsing chemotherapy as a great way to lose weight.u/hankjmoody [moderating the discussion thread this week.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR8qd4LOwAo)Yeah thanks! I always thought he low-key resented Stewart for stealing his schtick. I think Jon had the bigger platform, at least in the sense of being respected by elite opinion, e.g. the New York Times. Maher never had the same level of respect or recognition.  I miss stuff like this lol [https://youtu.be/AIpdC0o3mdM?t=30s](https://youtu.be/AIpdC0o3mdM?t=30s) &lt;-- The Arab Fashion Show.Damn, that’s crazy. u/aererereiuo says [heart attack in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Maher/comments/8wa2iq/real_time_is_on_hiatus_until_august_3rd_2018/e1y2w6d/)They always end up on YouTube lol. No one wants to pay for HBO.There were two rumors, one was diabetic shock and other was heart attack. I’m glad Bill called out those slow first responders This just might be my favorite simile ever./r/wooooshI agree with you and yet if I had his experience of people literally stopping me from speaking at a college campus, I would probably also think free speech was under assault. This is where I break from Bill. I am an agnostic liberal and am not a fan of religion on a whole but am alright with people practicing it as long as you keep it to yourself. 

There are millions upon millions of Muslims who are just trying to live their lives and have no desire to behead anyone or blow up a building. However Bill acts like Muslims are the biggest threat to America.

He acts like you can't be liberal and like Muslims. I am against gay bashing and violence against women. These are things that are not exclusive to Muslims. Many Christians and even atheists do that. As a liberal, I support an individuals right to practice whatever religion they want as long as they keep it to themselves. I don't see supporting the right of a person to be a Muslim and supporting gay and women's rights as two separate concepts. 

He's always trying to get Gavin Newsom to run but I don't that's who you're talking about. The Ghost of Comedy Never-WasI said the same thing after reading over these guests. I was looking forward to hearing from her.Malcolm Nance actually blamed the low turnout in 2016 on Russian meddling...has he read any history....can he really be that stupid. USA always hangs around 50 percent turnoutExactly! That was completely insane as well, like Trump is the biggest moron on the face of the planet but then him and Putin are convening over a new Yalta. WTF? Maher even wondered aloud if they discuss splitting up the world openly. I feel like I am losing my mind, people are going crazy.Russia definitely did things to change the tide of the election. Now I would not blame everything on them, but they did play their part in stirring dissent.Yes. I say don't blame Islam. The reason being that there are around 1B Muslims. They aren't all terrorists. Yes there are extremist elements but the vast majority of Muslims just want to live their life like anyone else and has no desire to start a holy war.I loved the religious part. I honestly have no idea why Christians love to play this "we are under attack" game. Jon Stewart made some interesting commentary on this a few years back. He essentially pointed out that not getting everything you want is not the second thing as being oppressed. 

Basically, they feel under attack because they aren't allowed to openly discriminate against gay people or non-Christians. They want a world that conforms to their world is and because they are told "live your life how you want but you have to allow people to live their own life" they feel they are under attack.Race absolutely played a role. Now I would never say that all Republicans are racist..... But the party sure has a ton of them in the party. There are some who legitimately fear white people becoming a minority. Years ago Bill O'Reilly did some commentary on them. They also tend to see non-white people as untrustworthy and threatening. 

There are many who believe that brown people are taking good jobs away from white people. They believe that EEO policies, diversity programs, and affirmative action are ruining America. It is taking jobs and school spots from quality white people and giving it to less qualified dark people in the name of "diversity". 

Here are some sources showing it


https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/us/politics/trump-economic-anxiety.html

https://www.theroot.com/how-the-republican-party-became-the-party-of-racism-1827779221Ya. I do think his "Republicans love Russia" argument was pretty weak. I think the run of the mill Republican is indifferent. When Mitt Romney said Russia was our greatest enemy in 2012 a lot of Republicans got behind him. Now Trump says Putin is a really great guy and they back that. They have no strong opinions. Whatever their leaders sayWho makes a reddit account to only post on a Bill Maher sub? And a pretty dead one at that?
Go back to Russia mate I have to ask, with all due respect....are you retarded?
I don’t understand why he can’t fathom some jokes just don’t land. But instead he blames his audience for being religious snowflakes lol.Sometimes I get what he is saying, he will say something that leans a little more libertarian and no one will react. Then he will say something extremely in line with the left and get HUGE applause even if it’s something simple like “let’s ban guns!”(although I know bill doesn’t say this, it’s just an example because I can’t think of anything specific)
I think half of the time he’s right when he calls out his audience but the other half is probably ego. 
I saw criticism of her appearing on Maher on Left Twitter. There’s a lot of anger among some on the left for his comments on Muslims and lack of sympathy towards Palestinians. She listens to those people and might have cancelled her appearance in response. You are reading the room wrong. It is uncomfortable, forced laughter. Correct - but sometimes, even when he has a dead on, biting observation, he gets mad when the audience gasps instead of laughs. 
We gasp because we’re reacting along the lines of  “Man that was good. Dude you went there” - not because the joke sucked. 
I’m shocked that he doesn’t know that a gasp isn’t necessarily a bad thing. But he does it throughout the show too. Doesn’t make sense, but ok. Try the Bugle podcast. That is where Oliver started and Andy Zoltzman even sounds like Oliver. It is UK-centric but it is good to break out of the USA bubble. If you cannot get enough of Oliver because he takes breaks like Maher does, then get your fill of the same humour via The Bugle. OP and others did. 

Edit : I wanted to mention it at some point in this thread and mistakenly chose your comment. I guess Lawrence O'Donnell is a draw but none of the others really pull me in.He’s not a lightweight. He invites the smartest thinkers in the world and he can hang. Such an Imp. haha Ya. It isnt racist. For one. There isn't a historical precedent of people comparing white people to apes. That started in an attempt to make black people seem inferior to whites. 

Second, if anything, Maher is attacking her intelligence saying she is no smarter than an ape. While I am not sure about that, she is definitely an idiot.Maher just can't let the "Trump lost the popular vote" angle rest. Instead of criticizing the electoral college (which could be modified to accommodate demographic shifts rather than abandoned) I wish he would put the same energy into switching to [ranked choice voting](http://www.fairvote.org/).

US, CA, UK are really backward with their electoral systems. AU is better, DE and NZ are best. Scotland has a really interesting but complicated system (I suggest  a YouTube video to understand it).

I first wrongly posted the above in the August 10th thread. Unfortunately the Reddit threadd do not list an episode number and the podcasts are not named sensibly with a date. I thought it was a little glib. We’re many different people, with conflicting intentions and goals. Also, Obama was far from perfect.  When we talk about him as some kind of saint, we’re mostly focused on how telegenic and polished he is rather than his actual policies or skills.  Deutschland aka GermanyYouTube has the episodes within a few hours of airtime. I still pay for HBO regardless, but I hate that HBO doesn’t stream it until the next day. I don’t think that it’s fair that I pay for a service like everyone else, but they get Bill Maher before I do. I’ve had to exercise the YouTube option once or twice, but the quality is compromised a bit.Preet was so weak.  “We don’t win by calling it treason, we win when the guy who says make your bed writes a letter in support of a former intelligence official.” JFC Democrats are lame. That’s how you stop the creep of fascism: nuancing harder. Ya, that really got me. The government didn't ban him from speaking. Private companies did. The internet is big. Create your own platform, sell your male vitality pills on it and create a streaming service and show Facebook what's what. 

Alex Jones is dangerous. To us, he is a clown that it entertaining in an ironic way. To his followers, he is a prophet telling them the secrets of the world and that they need to do something about it. 

That's different. You cannot discriminate based on race gender or sexuality. However, you can discriminate against assholes. If a trans person came into a bakery and was very disrespectful or was talking about killing the staff or whatever, kick their ass out of the restaurant. But if you ban them simply because you don't like gay people, be a decent human being for a chance. 


Alex Jones wasn't banned because he was white or a man or over 40 or straight. He was banned because he violated the terms of service and engaged in hate speech. 

These two issues are completely different. It isn't that liberals are inconsistent, it is just that you don't understand the complexity of the issues.[His most recent appearance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4HqG0wW5E0)The weeknight talk shows are almost all on vacation this week so there's not a lot of places he can go.  what happened to the responses?Wouldn't they look in occasionally and then notice the top Reddit posts? Anyhow I did follow your advice and [tweeted them](https://twitter.com/sqgl/status/1035554474029281280?p=v#).OK, thanks, this is my only contact. Most of what I saw was just vulgar. Can’t run a droll farm on that.Jim Carrey seems to be the only wild card. I wonder if he and Bill will talk about vaccinations. Otherwise not sure why he is there.&gt;  I got what he was saying in both instances, but really not the best choice of words

If you understood what he meant, why the fuck does it matter if he said it inelegantly?  It wasn't her place to talk during New Rules.  This isn't news to anyone.  That's the one part of the show where the panel's opinions aren't welcomed.&gt;  I got what he was saying in both instances, but really not the best choice of words

Al Franken is not Harvey Weinstein or Bill Cosby. There is nuance to sexual harassment just like pretty much every other crime. If Franken was a little grabby, he should say "It was wrong. I was a dunce. I am sorry". He didn't rape them, force them to watch him masturbate, drug them, or hold them against their will. 

Now if he denied it fervently then I would feel different cause I like people to own their mistakes. Say yes it was an error.Most likely not. He is just reflecting on the news.Al Franken was a liberal beast in the Senate though. He wasn't afraid to stand up to Republicans or for what is right. Warren and Sanders are still in the Senate fighting hard and Michelle Obama is doing it in her old way. We do need Franken (or at the very least someone like him) back. Free advertising and being paid by Nike are two different things :-)Has anyone seem **Active Measures**?  I’ve been interested for a while but I read one review that said it was too scatterbrained with MTV-style editing to be cogent. I hate S.E. Cupp as she is super disingenuous. Plays the atheist card when she is religious to some degree and is very wishy washy on her political beliefs. She is intellectually one notch above Tomi Lahren, maybe. 

Steve Ballmer might be interesting. Curious what he is going to talk about. He isn't really all that involved with Microsoft and not sure how relevant he would be with tech but we shall see. 

Richard Clarke is a good booking and I have no formal opinion of Mark LeibovichI saw something on Twitter like “How much candy is Trump going to have to give Michelle Obama to get back in the media’s good graces?”He always does that.  It’s a nice interviewing touch IMO. - Has anyone noticed that they started doing the comedy bit earlier in the show? It basically means I turn the show off earlier. the bits are always lame and when the new guest comes in it breaks up the conversation

&amp;nbsp;

- I was surprised to hear Richard Clarke talk about teaching at Harvard. I honestly thought he didn't do anything besides appearing on the show every few months

&amp;nbsp;


- People think the problem with Trump is his narcissism and other mental health issues. The problem is the Republican agenda 

&amp;nbsp;


- SE Cupp just... Wow

She's trying to clear her name in the wake of Trump. But in reality, she is one of the right wing blowhards who always blasted Obama and pledged allegiance to the most rightward politicians she could find. Now, like so many other Republicans, she regrets being a moron, sort of. Also in reality, she wants to go down on the right side of history.You know, PJ O'Rourke is a conservative that I respect. He tends to stay pretty rational. His humorist mindset comes in and he makes some off comments but overall he is intelligent and rational. Bourdain [did not like Bill or Real Time](https://lastnighton.com/2017/01/06/anthony-bourdain-rips-smug-bill-maher-vows-never-return-real-time/) so that's why. Petty on Bill's part perhaps, but I also doubt Bourdain wanted to be honored by a person he disliked on a show he disliked. What would you have liked to hear from Bill? I don't really disagree with what you're saying so not sure where the hostility is coming from. I was just trying to provide a link and some context. It's fine I probably worded it poorly and should have left out the "perhaps". I honestly don't remember the joke he made weeks later that you're referencing, I may have skipped that episode. That does make it worse than him just not mentioning it.I kind of think Maher is starting to go the Carlin route a tad where he begins to behave like the grouchy old man. 

I have been following Bill since the start of Real Time and I do like what he offers. He does make an attempt to have a diverse array if panelists, even people he may disagree with politically. He is pretty good at that and he is pretty decent at getting his facts straight. 

There have been more than a few times where he has passed his opinion as fact but he does it less than others. My disconnect with him is on some of the pseudoscience he allowed on his show and his disdain towards Muslims. I personally am not a fan of organized religion. I feel that it hinders people and social progress but I also acknowledge ones right to worship if they choose. I also acknowledge that there are (in all religions) extremists that take their doctrine wayyyyy too seriously but tend to be in the minority. 

He seems to do this weird fence game where he says he supports their freedoms but is also very against them. That always bothered me. 

There are some people on the left who are purists and don't like the fact that he isn't that far left. A "corporate Democrat" if you will. I really don't care about that myself. You know, when the New Yorker festival canceled Bannon’s appearance, I just knew he’d show up on Maher’s show. I hate that Maher feels like he needs to give a platform to everyone who has had an appearance canceled elsewhere. Yes, I understand freedom of speech. Yes, I get it that Maher’s Berkeley appearance was unfairly canceled because of protests. 

But Steve Bannon is a different issue. I hate Milo Y (can’t spell that; too lazy to look it up). But at least Milo Y is an asshole who just makes noise. Bannon is actively working as a political operative to stoke division, racial tension, and the collapse of democracies around the world. He has enough political clout and connections on the inside to help usher in the disastrous political changes he wants to see. Why give him another platform? This man is not just a noise-maker, he has connections and is using them. He doesn’t need another outlet. I don’t get the point. “Don’t be afraid to be labeled a racist.” This guy doesn’t need another platform to spew his poisonous agenda. Overall good show but I have to disagree with Bill and Moore on lying to constituents. Don't make promises without a plan. The car analogy was terrible. I don't know, maybe I shop for cars differently but I always made sure that I had a budget for the expenses before I buy. 

I think politicians should have some kind of plan in place (or skeleton of a plan at the very least) before they make promises. I have mixed feelings. On one hand, a lot of his rhetoric is terrible. It is very anti everyone but white Christian males. However, maybe we need to know that these people exist and what they actually believe. Right now I feel like he is a Boogeyman. We all know he is bad but few people know exactly why. Let him speak and dig his own grave. Before 2008, you could see just about every episode on YouTube. Then they began to crackdown.Ah, okay. Should have checked that. Thanks for the correction. :) 

But I still stand by the rest of my comment. We need to stop giving people who have power and use it nefariously an even bigger platform. That was my basic point. 

Thanks again for the correction.  It’s in the movie. They basically turned this neighborhood into a pretend war zone with no advance notice. If you think it’s no big deal, ask yourself how you would feel if it happened to you. Milo and Alex Jones have proved deplatforming works. Debating them does not. I hated his smug little grin he had That’s what I was saying. But I didn’t check first, and was correcting by the first person to respond to me: apparently Bannon was booked on Maher before the NYer cancelation. 

You’re completely right, though. Having your public appearances canceled is almost a guarantee of getting invited onto Maher’s show. 

And, don’t get me wrong, because I do love Maher, but it’s so predictable at this point: he’ll most definitely bring up the venue from which the guest was disinvited or whatever, and start clamoring about freedom of speech (which I do not necessarily disagree with him on). I just see Bannon as a different case from the other guests. 

But, hey, he can have on who he wants. I won’t watch one episode. I’m sure my not tuning in isn’t going to ruin a second of anyone’s life. I’ll watch the week after and going forward as I usually do. To each his own. The Milo episode was the start of Milo's unraveling,  I remember hating the episode but Milo's been pretty quiet ever since. On "Evangelicalism", I grew up in this environment in Texas. Very Christian, very dogmatic, very Christian. In the George W. Bush era, speaking against Bush was akin to saying "I love Satan". 

No political movement has succeeded without some form of indoctrination. Religion has been used for millennia as a means to control society and grow the Empire, Nation, Society. Had the Chinese Emperor not adopted Confucianism, Confucius  would likely have been a lowly philosopher. Now this ideology still lives in the zeitgeist of Asia to this day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Christianity was just an offshoot Jewish sect (one of many) but Emperor Constantine adopting it helped it grow to what it is today. This goes on and on. Religion provides a means of control and creating a structure to society. If an Empires society was a free-for-all, it would likely collapse in just a few generations. Religion is a useful tool in getting people to adopt social norms. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now how does this apply today? Dominionism. The TL,DR of it is that it's a theology that believes that government and society should follow a strict Christian beliefs. All leaders (political and otherwise) should be Christian and everyone should follow Christianity. This ideology isn't new but it really started gaining life in the 60s and 70s. Now, who really liked this idea? It didn't start at the bottom, but rather, started with religious leaders who wanted more power. Think of the Jerry Falwell's of the world. It wasn't enough to have a congregation that took everything he said as gold, he (and people like him) wanted more power. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some of them may have legitimately believed that having everyone be a Christian would be better for society but for others, it was a power grab. The Moral Majority then essentially used Ronald Reagan as their guy on the Presidential scale. Once they were successful then, we saw them gain in other parts of government. Senate, SCOTUS, House, Governorships, etc.   


I remember being a younger Evangelical. What the pastor said was golden. Basically, you assumed that the pastor understood God better than you could because that's what they dedicated their life to do. They were holy. If the pastor told you that good Christians would choose George W. Bush because he was a man of God and the Democrats were anti-god, you would follow what he said. You get stuck in this mindset that the pastor is always right. Religious leaders are always right. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now we have Trump, someone who doesn't exemplify the teachings of Christ at all, who is also a darling of the Evangelicals? Why? The Religious Leaders give less than a fuck about whether or not Trump is following the Bible. He is simply a means to an end. He will definitely help push their Dominionist agenda. He doesn't care. In fact, he probably loves it. His ego is getting pet by Evangelicals everyday. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Religious leaders will then tell their flock how Trump is the best thing for Christians despite not being a great Christian. They may reference King David being a man after God's own heart despite having multiple concubines and wives because he still pushed God's agenda. Evangelicals won't question the authority of their leaders as they have been indoctrinated to believe that they always know more.  And that is how we got where we are now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please note, when I say "Evangelicals" I am not talking about all Christians. I live in Cali now and have seen a lot of liberal Christians who are NOTHING like the Evangelicals. Evangelicals are dogmatic, far right Christians. They are the ones who are anti-gay, anti-muslim, "War on Christmas", type people. Debate doesn't change people's minds. It's just a naive relic of antiquity values. When you're asking how *you* can change someone else, you're asking the wrong question. Any psychologist will tell you that's a doomed quest.- best/worst new guest has to be Andrew Sullivan's mustache

- Doris Kearns Goodwin has been caught plagiarizing multiple times. I don't understand why she still gets this kind of media attention. Are there really not more credible historians? Course, the real answer is that she's booked for her grandmotherly affectations. 

&amp;nbsp;

- I like the newly radicalized Soledad O'Brien

&amp;nbsp;

- I basically stopped watching once they get to the comedy bit, which is inevitably lame. That has always been true. Believe it or not, they actually seem to interrupt less than they did a few years ago. Or at least Bill does. It is weird, the people who try to be self-righteous are always the worst. Bill Cosby is a good recent example. This is really common. There are a lot if white men (mainly in the right) who seem to think they are under attack. The only white men under attack are shitty ones like the ones who marched at Charlottesville. Most of us are fine with white people on an individual level. However we acknowledge that society is stacked in favor of white men and we want to try to level that out.That's usually the case. Many of the right winged white men have never thought about things from another person's perspective. It is not racist at all. I am talking about a subsection of white people (not all white people) who can't empathize with other people (usually on the right). Has less to do with the fact that they are white and more with their ideology. I don’t think it’s about screwing up live. The new left, the twitter left, that AOC is part of, hates Maher (and Ricky Gervais for that matter).  &gt; 1) Why was there no mid-show comedy bit?

They’ve been getting my letters!Woah. You cracked the code. Are you fucking kidding with Omarosa and Steve Bannon back to back? Will you please stop giving a megaphone to sociopaths? There is literally no reason for anyone to ever speak to them.Right. They understood what he was saying.  They just didn’t agree. 

The idea of the show is supposed to be the clash of ideas. But Bill couldn’t stomach any argument that challenges this longstanding belief he’s had that political correctness is about overly sensitive college students trying to censor him.  I think "get back to normal" means that we need to go to a world where respectable adults are running thingsHard question to answer. I personally think it's the Democrats to lose in 2020. But knowing the Dems, they will somehow run someone who will lose I agree. Vote Democrat at this point in time. If you aren't wealthy, you have no business voting Republican. Nowadays, you vote Republican if you hate certain people. Immigrants upsetting you? Vote Republican. Tired of hearing about "the gays" and "the blacks"? Vote Republican. Want to get rid of Muslims? Vote Republican. 

These are clearly the reasons why someone would vote Republican. People say "I don't like handouts and that's all Dems do". Blue states pay the welfare of red States. Can't claim you vote Republican because of the economy. Deficit and debt have gone up. 

At this point, people vote Republican because they want to reverse progress.I dunno, if HBO can’t get this stuff up until THE NEXT MORNING, they kind of deserve to lose their subscriber base. What do you like, if anything? 
I’d argue the party has changed more than Bill’s politics have.
The party is becoming more like “unless you are a gun hating, socialist vegan you are a republican”
I think this kind of partisanship is dangerous. It only adds to people’s uneasiness during these times of escalated worry while  trump is in office. I have 3% Neanderthal DNA and I have never been so insulted. How about #dumboldcracker ?Mooch's strategy of calmly talking over everyone is irritatingly effective. I wish Bill had just cut his mic.I don't understand this tendency on the left to think that good strategic advice comes from Centrist Republicans. They don't have our best interests at heart and they don't have any contingency. Yep. This is a political show. Why get Stormy Daniels this close to the midterm. She is a woman who fucked the president, not a political  analyst who can give us useful information. If this was immediately after the news broke, fine. But the whole story has played out already. Why bring her in now?

And Scaramucci is useless. He exists solely as a source of entertainment. He was garbage when he was on a few months prior.Mooch makes Bill look bad. Bill had a hard time keeping control of the panel with Mooch rudely interrupting every syllable. I thought Bill was going to lose it. It was a great New Rules bit. But I don’t think the Mooch adds anything to any discussion about Trump, because he’s such a Trump suck up.The amount of spelling mistakes in this post and comments tho
