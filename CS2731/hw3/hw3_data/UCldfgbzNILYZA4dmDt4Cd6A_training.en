and we are back Glen's computer just
died on us at the last second there but
he's back it was literally three seconds
after she went off you came back so we
just missed it okay where was I
so my next question is he has said he
seemed open to the idea of if not just
flat out in support of theocracy so do
you think he will implement you know
theocratic policies yeah I mean I think
you know we discussed earlier why I
don't like the comparison to Trump and
one reason is is that he comes from this
kind of old-school cold war
anti-communism ideology whereas the
modern all right is more concerned with
alleged dangers of immigrants from
Muslim countries and African countries
and the like that tends to be their
focus but a second reason is that a
major part of Bal senarios political
appeal and political ideology and
identity is this evangelical fanaticism
that has taken over large parts of
Brazilian politics and political life
and even though Trump kind of nods to
that I mean it's not really a major part
of his worldview where is Boston ro
absolutely has relied upon this very
fanatical religious retrograde political
movement that cares almost entirely
about religious and social issues and so
I think that you know he said things
like in the religious context the
minority has to bow to the majority and
he's obsessed with Israel in part
because of kind of militaristic reasons
but also because of the standard
evangelical religious reasons he went to
Israel and was baptized there so yeah
there's definitely going to be major
social issues that are religious and
moral istic in nature that are gonna be
part of this agenda because that's a
major part of what he featured in this
campaign will he cut economic program
safety net programs for the poor so this
is one of the big question marks is
because and I think this has been part
of some of the misunderstanding about
Boston are aware
getting claimed kind of like it gets
claimed with Trump that this narrative
that people were suffering economically
and voted for him for that reason
doesn't work because it was rich
segments of the country that voted for
wall scenario and it is true the rich
segments of the country voted for both
scenario but in Brazil only a tiny
percentage of the population can be
classified as rich no matter how broadly
you wanted to find that term the vast
majority people are poor by any measure
so there is a serious question mark
about how far you can go in cutting
safety net social programs in a
population where roughly 60 to 70
percent of the people are barely above
the subsistence level and need those
programs in order to survive and maybe
another 10 to 15 percent rely on them to
just stay kind of hovering around the
poverty line to what extent will they
tolerate cutting deeply into social
programs before they're serious social
unrest meaning like real instability I
mean that's the thing is that bowls Naro
has a lot of popular support behind him
but brazil is a huge country of 210
million people it is a country that is
very well armed in terms of the favelas
the slums where ball Cynara wants to go
and unleash the military and the police
to just indiscriminately kill people and
the thing that would probably caused
instability more than anything else is
cutting some of these social programs
that the Workers Party implemented and
kind of got people attached to and
dependent upon so how far his economic
guru Paulo Gettys can actually go how
much the Congress is going to be willing
to risk reelection in order to take away
programs from the poor remains to be
seen the main thing they want to do is
what they call pension reform which is
kind of just like cutting Social
Security you know retired people who no
longer work depend upon these payments
it's I think 25% of the national budget
that's the thing they really have their
eye on first the idea of taking away
what I described earlier is bolsa
família or some of these really and you
know small but necessary and type-r
programs that's gonna take a much bigger
haul to make the population swallow so
the first thing the first big test is
whether Paul Gettys and Wilson REO can
cut pensions that people you know have
worked their whole lives in order to
earn and be vested it I'll be interested
to see if he'll be as brazen as the
right in the US on this front because
one of the things that's fascinated me
is their ability to just flat-out lie
I'm talking about the Republicans in the
US and you know like Trump for example
has been out there saying oh the
Republicans are gonna protect your
pre-existing conditions we're not going
to take away your protection for your
pre-existing conditions and he's saying
that at the exact same time that his
administration is involved in a lawsuit
to try to take away protections for
pre-existing conditions so I'm very
curious yeah he's actually he's actually
been not only hasn't been saying we're
protecting he's saying the Democrats are
trying to take away preconditions and
we're the ones fighting to protect
though it's it's genuinely amazed by his
ability to just say whatever he wants
and just have no connection to reality
and get away with it almost because he
just makes it so that there's always a
counter-narrative
whatever the fact checkers or whatever
you want to call him on on CNN say he
can always say well they have a terrible
track record fake news I'm the one
that's telling you the truth and then
all of a sudden it becomes a 50/50
proposition so I'm curious to see if the
the rise of the right around the world
reflects that or if it's gonna be you
know if maybe Bolton our will take a
hands-off approach when it comes to
social programs for more practical
reasons like you just laid out final
question on bowls tomorrow is he
famously said that he would kill thirty
thousand of his political opponents do
you think that's true and if so I mean
you're in left-wing circles does that
scare you
whoa I mean the entire Bowl scenario
rise is frightening to anybody in public
political life who's not part of his
movement and you know not only I mean
four months ago Bowles nor I went on
Twitter and personally attacked me with
an epithet used for gay people basically
the equivalent of a [ __ ] my husband is
an elected official with the left-wing
socialist party piece all that kind of
broke off from PT when it became too
neoliberal and ran to its left
and the person who stabbed Wilson ro the
month before the election and almost
killed him was a member of peace all up
until 2013 so he blames my husband's
party for his stabbing my husband serves
in the Rio de Janeiro City Council with
Bolton our son who's an elected official
all three of his sons are one of them is
a city council member in Rio de Janeiro
and my husband currently as a petition
pending to remove Carlos Bolton ro from
the city council chamber because he
posted pictures threatening peaceful
protesters against his father using
pictures of torture so sure we've had
very direct personal confrontations with
him there's a evangelical pastor who is
a billionaire who bought and has grown
the second largest media conglomerate in
Brazil that was solidly behind both
scenario called hoards that in the month
leading up to the election began digging
into my past my husband's past people at
the intercept Brazil's past were like
the financial transactions of the
parents of our editors and reporters
because of the anti ball scenario
reporting we've been doing so
yeah when someone gets elected to the
presidency who has been spending the
last thirty years talking about the need
to slaughter political dissidents and
when he specifically praises the very
people who in the 1970s and 80s closed
media outlets arrested journalists
tortured them disappeared them and
killed them that's a risk that I pay
attention to and take seriously at the
same time Brazil now is a country that
has been democratic for 33 years and
there's a whole generation of editors
and journalists and judges and military
members and members of Congress steeped
in the idea that democratic principles
matter and I think that it's not going
to be so easy to just steamroll over
everything the way he might like to do
so I don't want to be you know gullible
and blind and just closed my eyes to
risks that are coming because they're
too unpleasant to face but I also don't
want to be panicky and hysterical and
kind of gloomy you have to calibrate
those risks life is never free of risk
but there's no question that junior Bowl
scenario is a serious menace to the
right of dissent to a free press to
basic democratic principles and to human
rights he's portrayed himself explicitly
as such has a 30-year record of
demonstrating that he means it and I
believe that he does um and so unlike
Trump who says a lot of things sometimes
to be provocative sometimes to get
attention sometimes to be manipulative
sometimes to be trolling
and sometimes because he really is that
poisonous inside gyre Boston ro is a
truly hateful ideology
you know like the real deal who was
already part of a military dictatorship
that he wants to restore with him at the
helm and so yeah I think that those
dangers ought to be taken seriously and
not just dismissed as playful rhetoric
okay last question and that was that's
heavy what you just hit me with they're
terrifying to be honest while I have you
here I have to ask you what's your take
on the Trump presidency to this point I
mean I think that by and large Trump has
proven to be what he said he was gonna
be and what we all saw that he was
during the campaign I don't really think
there's many things that have been
surprising he has presided over an
economy that not really due to him but
nonetheless has been thriving from the
standard metrics that people who talk
about those things used to evaluate the
economic success of presidencies
it's obviously not a good economy to be
a worker in wages are horrible working
conditions are terrible but I'm talking
about things that people who are in
Washington and used to evaluate
presidencies use like the stock market
like inflation like the unemployment
rate
none of the apocalyptic scenarios about
the US economy that people predicted
have happened he hasn't started any new
Wars
and he certainly intensified bombing
campaigns in Iraq and Syria but there's
there new Wars that he started he hasn't
started a war with Iran he hasn't yeah a
war yeah I mean he all you can do is you
know say what has happened up until this
point sure you know in IRA mean a year
ago he was trading nuclear war threats
with Kim Jong gun on Twitter and that's
a bright but he said he's about to bring
us into nuclear war and then the
criticism turn around in became oh he's
soft in North Korea that was it's a one
area where I actually give Trump quite a
bit of credit even if even if he's just
hands-off and he lets the South Korean
president take the lead for peace I'll
take it right and I mean he's also you
know gone after trade imbalances and
trade inequities that people on the left
for a long time have been complaining
about whether it's NAFTA or the TPP or
China's unfair trade practices that have
harmed the American worker these have
been you know causes on the left for
many years so you know everything you
said about him is true he's a
pathological liar I think that his
government is kleptocratic we're
probably gonna find out about incredibly
significant just graft kind of like
basic crude stealing of public resources
and bribes and the like with Jared
Kushner and Trump and the Trump family
that are still likely to come to light
his integration rhetoric and his
immigration policies have been cruel
though I don't regard them as a
fundamental departure from what Obama
did just worse by degrees and in foreign
policy I think he's been worse in some
cases and then veteran and others so
I'll try to North Korea what's better
well I think he's kept the u.s. largely
out of Syria in a way that I don't think
Hillary Clinton would have done I think
she would have involved the u.s. much
more in the conflict in Syria are
permanently there I mean yes but it's a
question of degree right so Hillary
would have done more she would have gone
she said she said she would write she
committing to things like analyzed we
wouldn't get involved at all but he
still allowed us to be put there and I
don't think he's surviving that I think
it's more our generals but he was like
whatever do what you want to do very
well and yeah I just think that Hillary
I mean Hillary was I think that in a lot
of ways Trump's foreign policy is a
continuation of Obama's and I think that
you know if you look at his efforts to
try and reduce tensions with Russia you
know the Doomsday Clock is two minutes
before midnight for two principal
reasons one of which is climate change
that he is severely exacerbated in a
devastating way by pulling out of the
Paris Accords and just refusing to
recognize it as a problem but the other
is the threat of nuclear war primarily
between the US and Russia so anything
that pulls down tensions between the two
countries that considered to be a
positive although he just announced his
intention to pull out of a serious New
Bern arms deal so you know I guess what
I'm saying is there are a lot of
horrible things to his administration
the realignment of the u.s. toward even
further toward the sort of Saudi Emirati
Israeli axis and you can put Russia in
there too and then his linkage to you
know he just recently spoke to ball
scenario we've been talking about in
Boston our worship its Trump and Trump
therefore likes Paulson our oh he's kind
of orienting himself toward these kind
of dangerous nationalistic movements is
also I think really disturbing but if he
but if you ask me for the big picture I
would say that in more or less adheres
to what I think he said he was gonna do
what he presented himself as being and
what if in January 2017 you asked me
what I thought it would be more or less
is what I would lay out I don't think
there have been very many surprises or
very many apocalyptic disasters of a
historic nature it's a pretty low bar
but I guess that's what I could say so
on on the issue of trade that you
mentioned early on there you're I think
you're referencing the NAFTA 2.0 D the
US MCA or whatever they're referring to
it as is that way yes yeah just so just
I think generally about the idea that
there are trade agreements that have
been bad for the American worker which
has been a prong of left-wing orthodoxy
for many decades anti-nafta anti TPP
objecting to World Trade Organization
and practices of China
I actually think questioning the value
of NATO in the wake of the collapse of
the Soviet Union the original threat for
which it was originally constructed and
conceived is a legitimate and positive
and healthy thing to be challenging so
you know I think that it's a very mixed
bag I mean I don't think he's
renegotiating NAFTA in a way that's
positive for the American worker and I
don't mean to suggest at all that that's
true but I do think that a lot of these
international organizations institutions
and conventions that are declared
sacrosanct and unquestionable by
official Washington including the
members of both parties are things that
need to be kicked and questioned and
scrutinized and challenged and open to
at least discussion about whether
they're really serving the needs of the
people whose needs they're supposed to
be serving and I think by opening up
those debates that otherwise would
remain closed he's doing some kind of an
intentional service yeah I agree with
that and I think that he's led me down
in the sense that not that I ever
thought he was gonna be great in the
first place but like when it couldn't
when I look at Obama I think he had an
anti-establishment mandate when he was
elected in 2008 coming off the george w
bush's time in office and we reached as
thomas frank says we reached a turning
point america and we didn't really turn
he wasn't like a new FDR he was more
like a Bill Clinton type character so he
had this anti-establishment mandate and
he kind of blew it now Trump I feel the
same way he also had an
anti-establishment mandate and you
pointed out how he's questioning things
that should be questioned even though
the establishment says you shouldn't
question them like NATO for example like
our trade deals but I feel the same with
Trump that like even with the rhetoric
being positive on trade like the new
NAFTA is very similar to the old NAFTA
with maybe one or two provisions tweaked
and you know then there's a giant
giveaway to Big Pharma in there and it's
it's unfortunately doubling down on many
of the status quo problems that we saw
in the first place but like you
mentioned with Saudi Arabia and Israel
how we're doubling down on our
connection to them and you know look
what I mean is that I think they're kind
of two trumps right when we talk about
the like Donald Trump and the Trump
presidency one Trump is the kind of just
in the daily insanity of the stuffy
tweets Polizzi towels like the totally
reality deprived statements he issues is
just kind of the circus that he
purposely creates and places himself as
its ringmaster so that he can be the
center of media attention which is the
thing he loves most then there's the
kind of policy apparatus and oftentimes
if not in the majority of cases what's
being done on a policy level has very
little to do with and sometimes is
actually the opposite of what's being
said and done in the realm that our eyes
are constantly being diverted to which
is the trunk on Twitter and the Trump
who just constantly draws attention to
himself and in that realm the realm of
policy I think Trump is in many ways a
continuation of what Obama was doing and
more often than not is just a
continuation of what the Reagan and and
the bush one administration's work in
terms of dismantling the system of
regulations putting reactionaries on the
Supreme Court you know even this whole
obsession now and heading towards the
midterm with the caravan and sending the
troops to the border this is classic
Karl Rove you know this is Karl Rove
putting gay marriage amendments on the
ballot to draw all the evangelical
voters out and turning the election into
a cultural war with utterly
inconsequential for the majority of the
population distractions about social
issues that's all he's doing is it's a
political tactic so if you kind of
ignore Trump the two
and Trump the trumpet ear and look at
Trump the Trump administration the
policy apparatus I think it's much more
normal and much more of a continuation
of a combination of Obama and Reagan
Bush than it is some wild deviation
there are some mild some wild deviations
that are isolated some of them are good
most of them are bad but in general I
think the huge US policy apparatus that
kind of operates separate and
hello everybody i'm very excited for the
conversation that i'm about to have
right now
i'm talking to lawyer journalist author
and co-founder of the intercept glenn
greenwald
glenn thanks so much for joining me man
i really appreciate it
it's great to be here i haven't been
called a lawyer at least not first in a
really long time so that's a little
hurtful
um but i'm so excited to be back on
secular talk it's been i think two years
that i've been waiting for an invitation
to come back that i'm going to overlook
that
in my excitement and happiness well i
really appreciate
you coming on and um you know i
i would literally talk to you for like
three or four hours if i could but
let's focus on the really big news that
just happened
um so i'm not i don't know much about
brazilian politics i know pretty much
what i've read in the intercept and
that's it
um i consider you somewhat of an expert
on brazilian politics i mean you live in
brazil
and i always see you tweeting about it
um
it kind of hit me like a ton of bricks
yesterday with the election
uh apparently a guy who some people
are describing as a fascist got elected
so what i want to do is talk to you
about
number one do you really consider him a
fascist and number two
how did we get to this point
so just to put things in context about
why
this whole discussion matters there are
two reasons one is that brazil is
actually the fifth most populous country
on the planet the world's fourth largest
democracy
the seventh largest economy it's the
biggest country
in all latin america and it has major
oil reserves so it has incredible
geopolitical significance and also it's
just a huge and influential country both
regionally and globally
and politics is just generally global
these days and so
very little that happens is confined to
the borders of any one country
i personally use the term fascist very
sparingly
i don't for example use it for donald
trump even though i think he has some
fascist tendencies or
parts of his mentality are inclined
toward a kind of fascist ethos
in terms of his ideology and what he can
what he has done and what he is able to
do
i would be very reluctant to apply that
word to him but i
most certainly apply it to jair
bolsonaro and i think that who's now the
president-elect
of that very large and influential
country i was just describing
and i think part of the problem has been
that the western media is able to
understand especially the american media
other countries especially complicated
ones that they don't spend much time
focusing on like brazil
through a very self-absorbed lens and so
this idea that bolsonaro is brazil's
trump or the trump of the tropics
two cliches that have become popularized
over the past several months to try and
understand him are wildly inaccurate
he's much more like
say the philippines president rodrigo
duterte and probably even more extreme
than him i think the best
model current model would be the
egyptian dictator general [ __ ]
he comes out of this kind of lineage
that trump a marine le pen
nigel farage other like modern alt-right
leaders don't come from
which is the 1960s and 1970s cold war
the idea that you
commit atrocities in the name of
fighting communism that's still
bolsonaro's
view of the world that that's the number
one threat to brazil and he was part of
a military dictatorship that lasted
until 1985 he views that military
dictatorship which
summarily executed critics detained
dissidents closed media outlets used
torture systematically was supported by
the us
in the uk as the superior model of
government
to democracy and has said that
repeatedly that he wants to bring brazil
back
to that period that really dark period
in its recent history of the military
dictatorship
would you say that uh brazilian
institutions are strong enough
to withstand like a total authoritarian
takeover
and i want to refer to a few quotes
of bolsonaro he said in 1993
quote i am in favor of a dictatorship um
when he was asked in 1999 if you were
the president of the republic today
would you close the national congress he
responded there's no doubt about it i do
a coup on the same day
the congress doesn't work and i'm sure
at least 90 percent of the population
would throw a party would applaud
because it does not work
congress today is good for nothing
brother it just votes for what the
president wants
if he is the person who decides who
rules who trumps the congress then let's
have a coup quickly
and go straight to dictatorship so i
guess my question is how much of this
looking back at it do you think that
that's a little bit hyperbolic and that
he'll actually do that
or do you think it's possible that the
brazilian institutions
withstand an authoritarian takeover and
that bolsonaro
even though he'll likely be horrendous
he won't actually become
a dictator so and then just to be clear
that
those series of comments that you read
he's been saying the same thing
you know even throughout the campaign
the last speech that he gave before the
vote on sunday
which he delivered by cell phone because
he was almost fatally stabbed the month
before and so hasn't been able to travel
was one in which he vowed to cleanse the
country of what he called the red
bandits by which he means the brazilian
left and said that
brazil will have a cleansing unlike any
scene in its history and that the only
choice is for
those who refuse to submit to his rule
will be prison death or
exile so he's been very consistent in
his ideology through the years
the question that you asked i think is
the most important one and the one that
everyone here in brazil is asking and
it's the main reason why i really reject
and resist this
comparison to trump because even if you
want to believe that trump deep in his
heart
is like cecilia duterte or bolsonaro or
whatever
the reality is is that american
democracy is 230 years old there's all
kinds of very powerful and established
institutions that have been
much more vibrant than probably ever
before and pushing back against him
whether it be
the media the judiciary that has
repeatedly declared acts of his
unconstitutional and probably most
importantly and impressively of all
citizen protest
in brazil that's the opposite um brazil
is a
democracy that's only 33 years old so
it's
i don't know what how old you are but
it's 30 years yeah
very close to my age too so um you know
it's a very young democracy
um uh roughly half of the public was
actually born into
a military dictatorship and a lot of the
people of wells norris generation
were part of it and so not only are
brazilian institutions very young and
therefore very fragile we don't have
generation upon generation upon
generation being
inculcated with democratic values people
are
remembering 40 years ago and they're
saying i wasn't a dissident i wasn't
tortured i wasn't killed it seems like
that would be better
on top of everything else you have a
convergence of extremely grave crises
an economic crisis that has that
originated from the 2008 financial
collapse and has caused brazil's worst
recession
in history 13 million people unemployed
you have a massive
corruption scandal where almost every
leading party
and members of the billionaire class
have been hauled off to prison or
indicted not for kind of isolated
corruption like i'll give you a hundred
thousand dollars a view for this bill
but systemic corruption you know i have
15 million dollars in a swiss bank
account
because i caused these contracts to go
to these oligarchs
so you have a complete collapse in the
faith of
the institutions to to handle the
economy
and it's destroyed people's economic
future and the
credibility and legitimacy of the
institution because of the corruption
scandal and then you also have a massive
epidemic of violent crime sixty thousand
sixty thousand people
a year or last year were murdered in
brazil and just to give you a statistic
if you're a rio de janeiro city police
officer the chances that you're likely
to die tomorrow
are higher than the chances were that a
u.s soldier would be killed at the peak
of the violence in the iraq war so when
you have a convergence of
crises along those lines those
institutions become decimated
because they're plagued with all kinds
of dysfunction and corruption
the public has completely turned their
backs on them
and so the only institution that has any
kind of popularity which is very
dangerous and actually in the u.s you
see this
starting to happen as well is the
military that's the only institution
that people really trust
for a while the military was kind of
embarrassed by bolsonaro because they
were trying to
shed the stain of the military
dictatorship and be rehabilitated as a
force that defends the constitution and
democracy
but this year the top level of the
military and all of the lower ranks more
or less consolidated in unison behind
him
and so they're really the only
institution the only faction
that has the power to impose limits on
his worst nightmare scenarios
and whether they are sufficiently
instilled with
the idea that their patriotic duty is to
defend the constitution and democracy
still
or whether they've kind of been
converted with a lot of the rest of the
population into the idea that
brazil's society problems are so grave
that you need
military order and rule which is what
led to the first military coup in 1964
remains to be seen nobody knows how the
military with their posture will be and
for now baltimore has a massive
democratic mandate he has
a huge part of the population behind him
his
party or his movement aligned with his
ideology took over
major parts of congress state houses
politics all up and down
the political spectrum so he doesn't
really need at the moment
to abandon the pillars of democracy to
institute a lot of his more extremist
visions because he has so much popular
support for it
because the population has just turned
its back on the ruling class largely
for good reason so let's talk a little
bit about uh
the amazon i've read in the wake of his
victory
that he plans to basically do a lot of
privatization
and basically open up the amazon to
western developers is that true
and how devastating would that be for
say the climate it's absolutely true
bolsonaro did something really shrewd
which is
aside from the military obviously a
faction that wields a lot of power in
brazil is the plutocratic class
and they've always been extremely wary
of bolsonaro because he's kind of like a
donald trump figure but even more on the
fringes of
um the mainstream and so
what he did was about six months ago he
said look i don't know anything about
economic and industrial policy i'm a
captain in the army
i know about public security i know how
to keep on order
i know about foreign policy and i know
about social issues
because i'm a man of god on my third
marriage
with um kids with each of my
increasingly younger wives
so that's what he said he knows he said
i don't know anything about economic or
industrial policy
so he hired an economic guru he said he
would empower to be kind of a super
minister of the economy named paulo
gettys
and paul getty's is this kind of
caricature
from what was called the university of
chicago school or the chicago boys that
privatized all of south america
during the cold war that sold off all
the national resources of chile under
pinochet who
bolsonaro explicitly admires and
the markets ever since have loved
bolsonaro every time a new poll comes
out
showing they were showing bolsonaro
increasing his lead this brazilian stock
market would explode the brazilian real
would get stronger
and in the wake of its victory even like
the cbc the state-owned
um and run media outlet in canada was
running headlines multiple ones saying
things like
well bolsonaro is a homophobic racist
misogynist and many believe he's a
fascist
but what opportunities does this open up
for canadian investors or canadian
mining and logging interests
so one apollo paulo gettys is sort of
like the wet dream
of international capital and the
plutocratic class
he wants to privatize everything and
brazil has
an immense amount of natural resources
and state-owned industries that have
funded
the minimal social programs that they
have and they're going to have a
privatized party a privatization party
where they're going to strip everything
out of the public treasury and sell it
off
to china to u.s oligarchs to
germans to anybody who essentially wants
to buy it there's going to be massive
graft as part of it
and you're absolutely right one of the
main natural resources of
brazil on which climate stability
depends globally is the amazon there has
for a long time brazil was one of the
stalwart protectors of the environment
of its environment of the amazon
but there's been rapid deforestation in
the amazon and that absolutely is going
to accelerate and just today they
announced
that they were going falsenaro announced
that he was going to consolidate the
ministry of
the economy the ministry of agriculture
and the ministry of environment
all into one super ministry which paolo
gettys is going to run
so they're putting the entire industrial
and economic policy under his authority
and he's as much of an extremist as
bolsonaro just not quite as shocking
because he's a
university of chicago trained economist
and therefore has these kind of
mainstream credentials but that's why
fascism is really the right word because
you have the three pillars of it
kind of militaristic law order
evangelical religious fanaticism
and this appeal to patriotism as part of
it in this unified nation
and then the merger of corporate and
industrial
policy with this political agenda it's
kind of the classic
case of academic fascism what you study
in graduate programs that fascism means
but also fascism and it's more
colloquial ethos
okay so i have a lot to say about that
that's uh
all right let's talk a little bit about
um
bolsonaro's opponent haddad and then
also let's touch on the former president
in brazil
lula now i'm going to tell you my
understanding of it which is
unquestionably
incorrect and then you can you know
correct everything for me
now i can knock back you for all of your
errors that's right yes
please i'm more than willing to take the
mockery
all right so my understanding is that
lula so he was the head of the workers
party he was president of brazil
and my understanding is that he was
relatively social democratic
am i good so far
you mean you're trying to place the
workers party on a kind of familiar
ideological spectrum
yes so let me let me just then interject
there because it's a really important
part of whatever you're going to ask
um and i think it's a really important
thing to recognize so the workers party
was created as a real left-wing party
lula himself came from extreme poverty
he was illiterate until he was
10. he was a labor leader he lost a
finger working in a factory because of
terrible labor conditions
so he was kind of the real deal as far
as being a radical left-wing
labor activist he led strikes he went to
prison for a short time under the
military dictatorship
he ran for president three times in that
carnation and lost three times
so in 2002 he said
i'm going to kind of do what bill
clinton did i'm going to remake the
workers party as a more moderate
business friendly party
he hired he chose as his vice
presidential running mate a very kind of
establishment-friendly pro-banker
uh long-time financier to reassure
international capital markets and
brazil's financial class
that pt the workers party was going to
be a business-friendly party
um and then he wrote this famous letter
so there was a giant election in Brazil
yesterday the presidential race was a
guy named Jay herb Olson ro who's a
far-right candidate versus Fernando
Haddad and this guy is from the Workers
Party but my understanding of the
situation is that he's relatively
centrist and bolson ro ended up winning
with 55% of the vote
so people are comparing this guy to
Donald Trump but Glenn Greenwald who
knows Brazilian politics better than
anybody else in in the u.s. certainly
better than any people in the mainstream
of the US who would compare Paulsen ro
to Trump he's saying no he's not really
like Trump he's a lot more like Rodrigo
Duterte of the Philippines and perhaps
even worse than Rodrigo Duterte so for
those you don't know Rodrigo doterra to
do territory in the Philippines is doing
a genocide against drug users that's not
like that's that's literal like I don't
even hesitate for a split second to say
that word there because he's openly
called he said kill them in the street
kill them where you see him I'm allowing
green-lighting the cops to kill them I
would want their families to kill people
in their own family they're uh you know
drug users but it might be too hard for
them so we'll just have the cops do it
the guy's nuts and also by the way there
are there have been articles about how
he's addicted to fentanyl which might be
one of the strongest drugs on the
 planet so as he's taking drugs
he's like let's assassinate drug users
just an outright authoritarian dictator
menace this guy is and again Boston ro
this guy might even be a little bit
worse so I have to give you a little bit
of the backstory as to what happened in
Brazil before we can get into this
election so there was a president in
Brazil by the name of Lula and this guy
was probably the best way to describe
him is kind of a down the line social
democrat moderately left-wing in the
sense that he really did implement
policies that lifted many people out of
poverty at the same time he lifted
people out of poverty though it's been
pointed out that the rich we're still
doing exceptionally well in Brazil but
the ruling class in capital they
despised Social Democrats they just do I
mean look at how Bernie Sanders is
treated even though Bernie Sanders is
not in any serious sense of the word a
radical they look at him and they
despise him same thing happened with
Lula in Brazil so they mocked up these
 corruption charges against Lula
and they locked him up then they
implemented a politician to be like an
interim president and this politician is
the most disliked politician in
Brazilian history which is insane so
then we had the election and it was it's
almost sounds very similar to what
happened in 2016 in the US where you had
like a very centrist not inspiring
candidate versus a far-right candidate
and the results were absolutely
disastrous and and Bolson ro1 so I've
already seen tweets of Lula would've won
hashtag Lula would have won in the same
way that we had Bernie would have won
because obviously you know the all of
the relevant data shows that Bernie
Sanders had a gigantic lead on Donald
Trump way more than Hillary Clinton's
lead on Donald Trump so there's already
these comparisons being made and by the
way Lula is still locked up over these
mucked up anti corruption charges so
that's that's the the groundwork okay
and it goes to a point we've made over
and over the only way you can beat the
fake populist on the right is with real
populist on the left well let me give
you more about gyroball senarios record
so you can see just how disastrous he is
I'm gonna use his own words here this is
was a great article in the intercept
they laid out quotes he's had from the
1990s and on he's been a politician in
Brazil for a long time now
and he's uh he's on the record about the
things he actually believes listen to
this here's here's one of his quotes the
big problem in Brazil is that the
government is at the jugular of
businessmen the worker will have to
decide less rights and employment or all
the rights and unemployment so he is an
absolute Crusader of a privatized ER ok
he believes in you know unregulated
unfettered capitalism an interesting
fact about that The Wall Street Journal
endorsed this guy so big money broke in
the fascist direction big money prefers
fascism and I'm about to show you how
that's literal big money prefers fascism
to social democracy which is why you
know when you have say Bernie Sanders
versus Donald Trump watch what happens
to all those so-called Democratic
billionaires and which way they break
the overwhelming majority of them would
break to trump and against Bernie
Sanders big money prefers fascism to
social democracy ok now we're just
getting started here this is his
economic philosophy he wants to
privatize everything and you know the
Amazon rainforest for example now
there's they're looking to you know
basically take a hatchet to the Amazon
rainforest for big business and let them
exploit the Amazon rainforest
devastating ok if I become president
bolson ro says there won't be any money
for NGOs nongovernmental organizations
these worthless people will have to work
if I get there as far as far as I'm
concerned every citizen will have a
firearm in their home you will not have
a centimeter demarcated for indigenous
reserves so you know hey native people
fuck'em let's have a gun in every home
and no money for non-governmental
organizations so again this speaks to
he's a hardline capitalist he wants to
Dax social programs beyond Brazil
above all since we are a Christian
country God above everyone it is not
this story this little story of a
secular state it is a Christian state
and if a minority is against it then
move let's make a Brazil for the
majorities minorities have to bow to the
majorities the law must exist to defend
the majorities majorities must fit fit
in or simply disappear so he's also a
believer in theocracy
hey listen Christian country God above
everyone forget secularism God above
everyone it's a Christian state and we
should have the tyranny of the majority
take away the rights of the minority
more he says I would not employ a woman
with the same salary of a man but there
are many women who are competent openly
admitting yeah I would never pay any
woman the same salary as a man to which
I would ask him what if they're
producing equal amounts quote I would
not employ a woman with the same salary
of a man all right let me give you more
I would be incapable of loving a
homosexual child I'm not going to act
like a hypocrite here I'd rather have my
son died in an accident than show up
with some mustachioed guy for me he
would have died if your son starts
acting a little gay hit him with some
leather and he'll change his behavior
that's one of endless endless anti-gay
quotes he is a die-hard and proud
homophobe it's gonna keep getting worse
I got more quote torture works I'm in
favor of torture you know that and the
people are in favor as well got a
healthy Dick Cheney streak in him quote
through the vote you will not change
anything in this country nothing
absolutely nothing it will only change
unfortunately when one day we start a
civil war here and do the work that the
military regime did not do alluding to
the dictatorship in the past in Brazil
killing some 30
thousand starting with fhc who was then
president Fernando Henrique Cardoso not
kicking them out killing if some
innocent people are going to die fine in
any war innocents die he's on the record
as saying votes not going to change
anything I'm not for voting let's start
a civil war and kill 30,000 people let's
kill my political enemies and don't even
just kick him out kill him and if some
innocent people die whatever it's fine
that's what a war is he's advocating
civil war and killing 30,000 of his
fellow countrymen because they disagree
with him politically an interviewer
asked him if you were the President of
the Republic today would you close the
National Congress he responds there's no
doubt about it
I do a coup on the same day it the
Congress doesn't work and I'm sure at
least 90% of the population would throw
a party would applaud because it does
not work Congress today is good for
nothing brother
it just votes for what the president
wants if he is the person who decides
who rules who Trump's the Congress then
let's have a coup quickly and go
straight to dictatorship which leads me
to my last quote he once said I am in
favor of a dictatorship a regime of
exception he's an open fascist that's
what he is that's what he is and it's
amazing watching mainstream media tiptoe
around that they would rather I'm not
kidding I've seen more headlines that
calm a populace than a fascist how
populist well on the minds of mainstream
media oh it's his tone you know hey
Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump have a
similar tone in that they sound angry so
their populist the is that
talk about laundering right-wing
ideology and trying to equate it to
social democracy and what did I tell you
The Wall Street Journal endorsed this
guy so big money breaks in favor of
fascism over social democracy they
didn't give a that he's on the
record saying kill 30,000 my political
opponents I'm in favor of torture isn't
dictatorship great I love dictator
ship gay people are in people they're
terrible and I would kill my son if he
was gay and I would never accept that in
any situation this is it's insane what
we're watching happen right now and
what's bothering me to no end is that
the establishment center is so
ill-equipped to deal with it because
they bring a butter knife to a gunfight
again the only way you defeat fascists
the only way you defeat the fake
populace on the right is with the
populace left and they actively kneecap
the populace left and and hold up the
right as preferable as better this guy
is as extreme as it gets and he's being
treated like just any other politician
[Music]
we need to have a serious conversation
about strategy to curtail the rise of
the far right because listen I got news
for you guys what do you think led to
this what do you think led to this now
establishment neoliberal corporatist
types which have you believe that
whenever a bad leader is elected it's
just simply because people are bad . so
vote for us cuz we're the good people
and we're against the bad people oh how
 genius are you what an inspiring
message no the reality is when the
establishment when the status quo has
screwed over regular people for so long
they're gonna throw a brick through your
window they're gonna blow up the
establishment and want to start from
scratch this is what we're seeing in
Brazil with Bolson ro you know this is
what we're seeing with brexit this is
what we saw with Donald Trump now that's
not to say that oh my god that's the
proper solution but it is to say that
when people feel like business as usual
is not working for them and it's hurting
them they will go to extreme answers and
I said it once I probably said it eight
times already in this segment the only
way to beat the fake populace on the
right is with the real populace on the
left but they keep trying to force-feed
us
a centrist garbage candidates again
that's why everybody and hash tag Lula
would have won Lula was overwhelmingly
popular locked up on mucked up
corruption charges and by the way this
is a lesson to the left you got to learn
to circle the wagons when it's time to
circle the wagons you have to learn it
man you have to do that because if you
don't do that they will co-opt the
things that you care about against you
so people on the Left care deeply about
corruption I know because I'm one of
them you know I support Wolfpack the
28th amendment to get money out of
politics I support you know ending the
revolving door and kicking the lobbyists
out of Washington
I'm as anti corruption as it gets it's
one of the main features of my political
ideology but what they're gonna do is
take the non corrupt people and accuse
them of corruption we've already seen it
when they've already tried it with
Bernie Sanders remember with the oh my
god his wife and a college and something
happened at the college where they did
something corrupt are you
kidding me you take somebody who is
literally the least corrupt politician
in America and you try to muck up a
corruption scandal against him why it's
the oldest trick in the book accused
them of what you're guilty of the guy
who they installed to replace Lula had a
way bigger corruption scandal than Lula
it was mucked up charges it was mucked
up charges so understand this is what
they're gonna do they're gonna come at
the populace left with every single
thing that they've got and they're gonna
try to turn you against your own the
left has to learn to unite to actually
fight to fight and win that's the only
way we're gonna win they're gonna try to
divide and conquer us they're gonna do
projection in order to try to defeat us
and accuse us of what they're guilty of
but we have to unite that's the only way
that we win and unfortunately is far too
easy to split up the left so I'm telling
you I'm warning you in advance get ready
because those are the charges that's one
of the first things that they're gonna
do and whether it's Tulsi
Gabbard or Bernie Sanders or ROH Khanna
or any of us we're going to go out there
the corrupt ones what to people who are
taking no corporate back money and who
are running on populist left policies
that help the people there the corrupt
ones and look at who's gonna be making
the charges it's gonna be neoliberal
democrat establishment type types or
it's gonna be you know orrin hatch
far-right lunatic Republican types so I
just need you to know what's coming
because this is the PlayBook that they
used against Lula in Brazil and it
worked so here we are
the rise of the far-right is still
happening and we may have just lost
Brazil two literal fascism and
dictatorship so we need organization on
the left now more than ever and we need
to be unapologetic and we need to fight
for what we believe in and we need to
build a movement based on real populism
left populism based on giving people
health care and education and paid
vacation time by law and a unions and
better wages and the freedom to use
drugs this philosophy you there's a non
philosophy in the center
hey status quo is great keep it as is
I'm gonna serve business that's a non
philosophy a non philosophy cannot beat
a philosophy and the far right love
miranium they have a philosophy so let's
combat that with the proper philosophy
the agenda that I just laid out because
that's the only way that we defeat these
absolute monsters
the establishment media is now trying to
force-feed us Biden 2020 so this is in
Politico take a look Joe Biden's
platform for 2020 ante populism by
criticizing the views of both Bernie
Kratz and Trump bites Biden is
positioning himself as the antidote to
populism in all its forms and flavors so
just I mean I could do an hour talking
about just that headline and Adam
Johnson affair wrote a really
interesting article about the term
populism which mainstream media has you
know absolutely abused and destroyed and
they he says they use it to launder
basically fascists and equate them to
people like Bernie Sanders and you know
I actually used the label populist to
describe myself I say I'm populist left
and the reason I do that is because the
definition of populism is carrying about
the concerns of ordinary people and so I
think I actually agree with the point
that Barack Obama made a while ago
during the 2016 election when he said
Donald Trump is not a populist the real
populist is Bernie Sanders well now you
know that it's clear the way that
mainstream media uses this and what they
try to do is equate the tone of somebody
like Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump and
the fact that they portrayed themselves
as anti-establishment and anti elite and
they try to link them using the
horse-shoe theory of politics like so
the guy you know hey if you go far left
enough those people are exactly like the
far right and if you go far right enough
those people are exactly like the far
left so Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump
are equally unhinged and that's a
complete and utter [ __ ] framing you
know one one of those two rails against
the elites in a literal economic sense
where he says hey wealth and capital
controls everything corporations and
billionaires really do control our
political system
they basically bylaws that screw over
the little guy and help them whereas the
the so-called elites that Donald Trump
rails against they're effectively
cultural elites so you know hey I'm
gonna rail against [ __ ] Hollywood and
I'm gonna rail against whatever black
lives matter and I'm gonna pretend like
there's this giant conspiracy of like
the Muslim Brotherhood and and you know
Jewish people honestly a lot of people
on the right think that Jews secretly
run the world a lot of people on the far
right so there's this like you know
agenda 21 UN conspiracy like thing where
all these disaffected groups are
actually secretly running everything and
that's not like that's not a version of
elite that is actually in control and
running [ __ ] so it's it's a [ __ ]
election strategy where you pretend like
oh my god it's the cultural elites it's
the you know the the Democrats they're
they secretly run everything and we need
to rail against then and it's like no as
you're serving the economic elites and
the establishment you know appointing
Goldman Sachs into your administration
doing the bidding of Wall Street cutting
the taxes of billionaires and
corporations as you're doing their
bidding you're you're trying to pretend
like you're anti elite so you're doing
the bidding of the economic elites while
you rail against elites it's honestly
just a run-of-the-mill conman trick and
unfortunately it works really well with
Donald Trump but now we're even seeing
this and we'll get to this later in the
show with the newly elected president of
Brazil balsan ro he's basically an open
fascist and I've already seen headlines
calling him a populist he's not a
populist stop using populist to describe
you know far-right authoritarians people
who are sympathetic to dictatorship
people who are honestly in many cases
openly fascist so they use this word to
basically launder fascism and equate it
to social democracy
and you know I think Adam Johnson's
answer to that is let's just stop using
the term populist I disagree with him on
that point I agree with him on
everything else but on that point
I would say just use the term properly
so if populism is caring about the
concerns of ordinary people
then the real populist is Bernie Sanders
and it is not these you know like Steve
Bannon and Donald Trump now look at what
they're doing here when it comes to Joe
Biden they're taking the term populist
and they're using it as a pejorative and
they're portraying him as like Ambus if
you're coming in on a white horse to
save you from the people who have a
harsh tone and it's like the tone is
irrelevant look at their actual policy
substance so yes people do need saving
from the far-right fake populist like
Donald Trump and we need better
politicians but they do not bernie is
the solution to that but he's portraying
it as another equally bad and I'm here
to be the I'm just a reasonable centrist
moderate so like yeah trust me because
I'm a corporatist and I love the status
quo and like that's obviously what we
need it's just it's so [ __ ] lazy man
it's so lazy
okay now you might think well perhaps
that headline is a little misleading
what is the substance of the article
saying well let's take a look so there's
in Politico they say on Monday former
Vice President Joe Biden wrote a blog
post that proves two things blogging
isn't dead and neither is Biden's
political career in fact in Biden's
essay and in other little-noticed public
pronouncements you can see him sculpting
a role for the 2020 presidential
campaign that perhaps only he could get
away with away with playing the voice of
anti populism though Biden's essay was
largely ignored amid the constant hum of
Trump related stories it made a bit of
news in wonk circles because Biden used
it to announce his opposition to a
universal basic income what a hero you
are Joe that newly vogue policy proposal
in which
American would receive a periodic check
from the government regardless of their
work status but there's more in the post
to decipher Biden criticized Silicon
Valley executives who have championed
universal basic income for selling
American workers short and undermining
the dignity of work he recoiled at
rhetoric often wielded by senator Bernie
Sanders and his acolytes that demonizes
corporations some want to single out big
corporations for all the blame but
consumers workers and leaders have the
power to hold every corporation to a
higher standard
not simply cast business as the enemy
and he cut against the prevailing
sentiment among Trump friendly
working-class whites that not everyone
should go to college
quote cognitive capacity as opposed to
brint as opposed to brawn continues to
become a sure path to climb that ladder
into the middle class so I need you to
understand something
the whole point of this article is they
didn't learn the lesson of 2016 they're
not going to learn the lesson of 2016
they're always going to take away the
exact wrong conclusion so what we
learned in 2016 is you cannot defeat the
far right you cannot defeat the Trump
like Republicans with the center with
so-called moderates with corporatists
with status quo enthusiasts because
those are the people that actually led
to the rise of Donald Trump the lesson
that they took away was no if anything
Bernie Sanders forced Hillary Clinton
too far to the left so what we need is
somebody to come in on the Democratic
side who's even more moderate even more
centrist even more Pro status quo and
that's the way to defeat Donald Trump
and oh yeah the cherry on top is aren't
Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders
basically the same thing they're never
gonna learn listen they smugly think
that this blog post makes
Biden a hero like Oh finally a
reasonable person stepping up and saying
shouldn't working-class Americans have
to put in more hours and bust their ass
to get nothing in return like he thinks
it's a bold stand like I'm against
universal basic income oh wow what a
[ __ ] hero you are what a hero you are
it really the establishment is beyond
clueless and by the way make no mistake
about it this is top-down the idea that
like you know regular folks are sitting
around and going oh did you read that
Biden blog post where he's against
universal basic income and he's
defending corporations what a reasonable
human being no this is literally the
establishment media sitting down with
people who are in Joe Biden's camp and
Joe Biden's people pitching
establishment media people hey we need
to try to make Joe Biden 20 20th thing
so how about you guys run a puff piece
on them to talk about how awesome he is
and how reasonable he is and we'll sit
over here and pretend like it's all
grassroots it's not grassroots and this
is definitely a concerted effort because
I've already seen polls any time for the
longest time when you the polls showed
Bernie Sanders being the front-runner by
a mile and a half in the 2020 election
on the Democratic side
well what happened recently well
recently there's been a few polls that
had Biden in front and then there was
one that had Biden way in front so I was
like wow that's an anomaly every poll
shows Bernie Sanders what the [ __ ] is
going on here
well come to find out when you dig into
the methodology they way over Samper
oversampled
older people so they left out
Millennials and they way over sampled
registered Democrats and they left out
independence
so who Bernie Sanders base who are they
not only is it the actual left-wing base
it's also Millennials and independence
so there's not yeah I leave out the
young people what why would you do that
there because they're trying to
force-feed you this on purpose they're
trying to force-feed you Joe Biden 2020
and by the way you would think that in
an article about Joe Biden running for
president I don't know maybe they would
add a line or two about the [ __ ]
thousand in one time she already ran for
president and he got his [ __ ] ass
handed to him on a silver platter I mean
the dude ran in when Obama won he ran he
got like [ __ ] 1% of the vote he this
has happened repeatedly oh yeah Oh Joe
Biden yeah Joe Biden look at that he's
definitely gonna do well oh [ __ ] he got
destroyed
he's VP Joe Biden that's the furthest
he's got this the furthest he's gonna
get but they don't even act like they
don't even add that Bernie Sanders did
way better running for president than
Jill Biden did and none of the articles
in establishment meteor-like well
obviously Bernie Sanders is the favorite
in 2020 look at the movement he's
created he won 22 states last time he
got 47% of the vote last time with the
DNC rigging it against him none of the
establishment media articles are saying
that I've seen articles on 2020 that
mention everybody except Bernie Sanders
for 2020 they've mentioned [ __ ] Mark
Cuban and Howard Schultz and Michael
Bloomberg there is ZERO grassroots
support for Michael Bloomberg this is is
a zero [ __ ] so these are all this is
all none of this is organic it is all
Joe Biden's people reaching out to the
establishment media let's try to get his
name out there let's try to make the
20/20 rumblings of thing and then
they're so out of touch they don't even
realize like oh if we were to go down
that path obviously Joe would have to
pretend to be further left than he is
obviously that's where the momentum in
the party is they're too stupid to even
get that guy's [ __ ] Kamala Harris and
Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker even
understand and they're corporatists but
even they understand well obviously I
gotta pretend like I'm further left than
I am in order to get elected duh look
overall the momentum is but Joe Biden is
so goddamn out of touch and his team is
so out of touch the like I got it let's
pretend like it's 1996 and run a
campaign like it's 96 and pretend like
we're so moderate and reasonable and
centrist if only a politician had tried
that a legacy politician who's beloved
by the establishment
tried to be a centrist moderate in a
recent election how did that go that's
right that was Hillary Clinton she got
destroyed oh my god it's so frustrating
guys it really is listen they are gonna
pull out every [ __ ] trick in the book
to try to defeat Bernie Sanders and you
need to know that we need to double and
triple and quadruple our grassroots
effort for Bernie Sanders in the
upcoming election
I think he's going to run and he is
gonna get maligned in mainstream media
they're gonna shame them oh my god
Bernie you're too old you're too radical
you can't do this yada yada
Joe pine is a year younger than Bernie
Sanders not a single [ __ ] article
mentions his age
so what we need to do I'm telling you
man we need to bypass corporate media
establishment media we need to stick
with each other and spread the word
through new media you know through
social media platforms and unfortunately
they're cracking down on these outlets
too but we have to find a way because
the way that Bernie Sanders can win in
in 2020 and in the Democratic primary is
he has to trump the Democratic field I
mean it in both senses of the word the
word Trump in the sense that he has to
he has to be so overwhelming in his
victory that even with them pulling all
the stops to try to prevent him from
winning they can't do it that's what
happened with Donald Trump you have to
remember remember the GOP lined up bite
okay I'll [ __ ] all right Jeb Bush is our
first choice oh my god Jeb Bush got
destroyed in the most embarrassing
fashion I've ever seen in my life okay
Marco Rubio we're gonna go to Marco
Rubio Marco good okay oh but Marco Oh
Josh [ __ ] Marco Rubio is gonna start
John Kasich I mean he's probably not
gonna win but let's try oh my god John
Kasich got destroyed okay fine will
[ __ ] take Cruz Cruz out [ __ ] Ted Cruz
got destroyed
oh god Trump one this is you don't think
the establishments gonna do that on the
Democratic side they'll start with all
backup Biden vines give me a zero okay
Biden got destroyed maybe Michael
Bloomberg gosh ahhhh [ __ ] Bloomberg's
doing even worse than Biden did okay uh
Kamala Harris yes come on Harris oh my
god she didn't do it oh but anybody
anybody but Bernie
so we
have to be the ones to drive home our
narrative because guess what our
narrative is correct the only way to
beat the fake populace on the right is
the populist left and the [ __ ]
mainstream media doesn't even understand
that populism isn't the pejorative they
think it is because they're still trying
to drive home that ya know populism so
that's that's why Bernie Sanders and
Donald Trump are the same thing no
that's not true that they're the same
thing and also Donald Trump is not
actually a populist Bernie Sanders is a
populist and you're maligning it but
what is that show cuz what's the
opposite of populism elitism so the fact
that mainstream media is anti populist
what they're saying is we're Pro elitist
and I don't even think they'd admit that
to you but that's but that's the framing
the framing is populism bad therefore
elitism good like all the ordinary got
isn't what the [ __ ] they're talking
about or what the [ __ ] they're doing so
obviously we need to go to these rich
people who've run everything into the
ground in the first place
we need to rely on them for decision
making you [ __ ] idiots they're never
gonna learn they're never gonna learn
and that's why these outlets are
[ __ ] the bed and that's why outlets
like ours are growing despite the game
being rigged against us so prepare
yourself because there will be so many
maddening articles about how awesome Joe
Biden is and about how awesome corporate
Democrats are that are just an outright
denial of reality and and grassroots
support we all know the real grassroots
support is going to be with the populist
left candidates
what's up [ __ ] I hope all you can see
me this is a little weird and I'll
explain why in a second
so I went to fire up this live stream
from my work PC and that didn't work
didn't work because I'm used to doing my
live stream on my Mac and the Mac is
getting repaired at the moment I see you
guys are in here cuz I could see the
comments but umm so I was gonna do this
live stream on the Mac but the Mac of
course is broken it's getting repaired
so I try to do it on the PC coming to
find out the browser I use doesn't allow
you to livestream so it was a little bit
of a pain in the ass but um anyway here
we are now I fired it up on my phone so
it should work and it looks like it's
working but I'm not sure what the
situation is gonna be exactly with the
live streaming 10 oh wait no that's it
looks like we got that taken care of too
ok yes ok wonderful wonderful wonderful
wonderful the [ __ ] that I gotta do to
make all this flow nicely anyway alright
enough with the personal technological
issues and stuff I got this everybody
was complaining about the shakiness if I
hold it so I got this on the stand
thingy and that appears to be helping so
yeah I can't wait to get the Mac back
man I missed the [ __ ] man already
Jesus Christ return of the Mac not only
is that a good song that's a good thing
that I can't wait to happen I feel like
the cameras all up in my grill too like
I wish I could push it further back but
I actually can't do that because I need
the phone to be close to me alright so
what did I want to talk about today a
lot of stuff going on the next regular
secular talk show will be on Monday so
there's a we're back to the regular
grind on
I'm actually really looking forward to
getting back on air the regular way
because I have a lot of stories that I
want to talk about and I just kind of
missed the routine and the structure of
the way it usually goes I mean the LA
trip was fun and everything but you know
I feel like it's time to just hop back
on that regular schedule because I'm I'm
a guy who's kind of obsessed with
schedule and organization to begin with
so the next actual secular talk show
will be on Monday but I did want to do a
quick livestream today later on I'll
answer your guys Super chats if you have
questions about politican or the LA trip
or Rogan or TYT or whatever and I'll
apologize in advance for when I
inevitably miss like half of the Super
chats because apparently every single
time I've ever done a secular talking
smack livestream I've always missed some
Super chats so my bad on that upfront
it's never on purpose it always just
ends up happening okay weird but anyway
so let's talk a little bit about the big
news over the past few days there's now
been a number of far-right wing attacks
and it's really scary because there's
been so many and such such a short time
frame and this reminds me of that
Department of Homeland Security study
that came out I think it was in 2009
that said look out because there's a
rising threat of violent far-right wing
terrorists and they gave the number that
71% of the attacks or the attacks and
the attempted attacks post 9/11 have
been from far-right wing groups whether
they're white supremacist groups or
sovereign citizens or just
anti-government extremists so now we're
seeing some of that happening and of
course there was the Maggie bomber come
to find out the guy who was doing all
the who sent the the pipe bombs to
Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and
George Soros and Joe Biden and Maxine
Waters and all these people he was a big
Trump supporter now it goes without
saying that doesn't mean that all Trump
voters are all
Trump fans or whatever are our bad
people but this guy in particular was an
extremist and he absolutely positively
loved Trump he had you know Magda bumper
stickers all over his his van and he had
Michael Moore and cross hairs and
apparently he had a history of abuse
abusing people on Twitter and he ended
up becoming a terrorist there was a
gradual slide into radicalization that
was pretty apparent if you look at
everything that was happening on his on
his social media feeds
so that was one instance of that and
then today we have basically a terror
attack slash mass shooting where we have
a lot of casualties there's at least
eight people who were killed in a
synagogue in Pittsburgh and I think they
already identified the guy who did it
the guy who did it is a no violent
neo-nazi basically they have his profile
from gab gab actually scrubbed it and
deleted the evidence but there's of
course all that stuff is archived anyway
so come to find out he was a massive
far-right wing extremist he was a
neo-nazi he apparently as he was in the
process of killing nearly a dozen Jews
and a synagogue he was saying all Jews
must die and it's terrible man this
stuff is terrible this stuff is gross
and it makes no sense it makes no sense
I wanted to talk a little bit about the
ideology that feeds characters like this
because I feel like that's really
important the white supremacist
subculture online is just the swamp and
it's so scummy and it's kind of crazy
that that these ideologies have grown in
recent times and there are so many holes
in their arguments that I'm amazed that
anybody's even attracted to them in the
first place so the most important point
to me is that these are the same people
who say black people are inferior
because they have low IQs
but then they also go on to say that
Jewish people are inferior even though
they have high IQs so these kind of
characters are big into like you know
junk science the [ __ ] eugenics
garbage and they genuinely believe that
you know hey it's a legitimate
conversation to discuss average group
IQs but it's hilarious because they're
accusing black people of having low IQs
and saying that's why they're terrible
and we need to get rid of them but
Jewish people have high IQs and that's
why they're terrible and we need to get
rid of them and it's amazing to me that
they don't catch themselves in that
giant logic fail and they also
hilariously say that well listen Asian
people have high IQs but we don't want
them in our ethnos state and we're gonna
refuse to call them we're gonna refuse
to call ourselves inferior but you're
saying blacks are inferior and you say
blacks have low IQs you say you also
have low IQs compared to Asians but
you're not an Asian supremacist which
seems to make no sense because if you're
actually following your own logic to its
conclusion you would be on the
extermination side of the equation when
it comes to Asians versus whites see
it's just it's it's it's so absurd
because these are also the same kinds of
people who love to bash lefties for
doing identity politics and it's like
why how can you bash them for doing
identity politics and then you buy into
identity politics as well you just buy
into vicious far right-wing white
identity politics so listen I'm a simple
dude and I've always said you should
judge people as individuals you
shouldn't judge people and just lump
them in with a group and draw
conclusions based on that I think the
most rational thing to do is to just
judge people as individuals but these
guys hilariously go out to the left and
say you guys judge people as groups as
they play white identity politics and
they judge people as groups and they're
so caught up in these conversations
about average IQ and [ __ ] who's good
news/bad it's like Jesus Christ what a
giant waste of time man and the
radicalization is now we're now seeing
that destruction unfold in front of our
eyes man is really creepy and I mean
what can you say people were absolutely
massacred people were were murdered in
cold blood and this is a terrorist
attack that is what this is so I've seen
a lot of terrible responses already on
Twitter there's one dude who I just
responded to maybe some of you saw it
he's saying he's blaming the left for
this of course because the left is to
blame for absolutely everything ever
according to these clowns and by the way
the guy who tweeted that is he trains
police officers he trains police
officers and he was doing the typical
tap dance of light did you know that
Hitler was a lift Hitler was a lefty and
he was a socialist and this guy who did
this attack bought into Marxism or
something I mean I'm so sick of the
people who play partisan hack games all
day long like you how is it that you can
never admit ever that there's ever been
a right-winger who's been bad or dunker
has done something evil or wrong it's
just it's so [ __ ] childish but that's
really the point we're at where she's
always you know finger-pointing and and
blaming and Grill the [ __ ] up man
it shouldn't be that hard to say and
we're at the point now where we we
obviously have to fight old battles in
the sense that we have to relitigate the
whole and rehash the whole Nazis or bad
thing you would think that that was that
was decided in the [ __ ] 1940s but no
we're right back to that and the people
who ironically claim to be most American
oftentimes or the people who go down
this slippery slope and fall into
extremism whether it be waving a
confederate flag and they were literal
traitors the United States of America or
sometimes embracing overtly white
nationalist politics if not in this case
the guy was a flat-out neo-nazi so it's
just terrible and my heart breaks when I
see this stuff and I
hope we don't see more of it but you
never [ __ ] know man there's been a
lot of radicalization that's happened
online so my heart goes out to everybody
who was impacted by this terrorist
attack and make no mistake it as a
terrorist attack there's already talk
about oh it's gonna be charged as a hate
there's gonna be hate crime that's what
this is okay fair enough I guess you
could say his hate crime because he
targeted them because they're Jewish
but he's doing political violence
against civilians that's the definition
of terrorism political or religious
violence against civilians so I hope
people call it what it is and recognize
the threat that it is and now you have
you know people on the right scrambling
at least the elected officials I should
say scrambling to say like okay violence
is always wrong don't do this violence
listen man I was tweeting about this
last night all political pundits even if
they're the happiest of all hacks like
people like Sean Hannity we should all
make a point to bring up the violence's
in the answer because I think that often
times pundits just assume that the
audience gets that but no there are
gonna be some people and granted it's a
tiny fringe of any audience but there
are gonna be some people who are like no
I actually think violence is the answer
and we should all make the point that
violence isn't the answer in my mind the
only time violence is justified is for
self-defense for if there's an imminent
threat of attack against you so you have
to respond and I just don't see these
clarifications made by almost anybody in
the political dialogue and it's
maddening but the and you know the thing
is one could make an argument that it's
like well we have a violent culture
anyway and that kind of feeds into stuff
like this and I think that's kind of
true like we casually accept the bombing
of people overseas but then people try
to draw arbitrary lines around like hey
we just shouldn't do violence here
against each other well no you also
shouldn't be doing the violence against
the people overseas you shouldn't be
bombing those eight different countries
Yemen was not about to attack us and
we're defending ourselves that's not
what happened and there's obviously the
various forms of domestic political
violence is accepted on the far right
whether it be police brutality or things
of that
Guantanamo Bay torture and stuff like
that so it's almost like we have a
culture of violence to an extent and I
always avoid those cultural based
arguments but I think there's a degree
of truth in that point so we need a
total realignment of our priorities in
our morality and we're nowhere near
having the proper discussion in this
country and we're nowhere near trying to
foster the proper value system and I
think we're seeing the terrible
situation unfold in front of us right
now okay so like I said I will take your
super chats in a little bit right now I
just want to run through some of the
quick things I wanted to talk to you
guys about but hold your fire on those
super chats I'll let you guys know when
I'll be taking them and should maybe be
I don't know 20 minutes or so from now
all right I just watched the MIT Romney
Netflix documentary which I wanted to
see for a long time and I hadn't been he
and I didn't see it and I'm happy I
watched it because what it showed me is
that Mitt Romney is exactly the guy that
I thought he was and almost the exact
caricature that the left has made him
out to be in fact I think that this kind
of proves that Mitt Romney is that
entitled Thurston Howell robot that you
know we joke about so there's a few
things that struck me in the Netflix
documentary first of all he genuinely
thought he couldn't lose he really
thought he couldn't lose he was
convinced both he and his camp were
convinced no no we got this and I'm
talking about when he ran in 2012 and
when he was against Barack Obama and the
level of delusion man that it takes to
think like oh no I got this dude you're
Mitt Romney everything about you sounds
fake and over-coached
but they were so convinced and this
shows you how deep that right-wing
bubble is they were so convinced that oh
my God look at all this news about Obama
that's negative because he probably
watched his Fox News all day and he was
so deep in there right
we bubble that he thought like no sure
you see seriously it's gonna be easy
because I'm being told in my own bubble
that everybody hates Obama so yeah I'm
just gonna [ __ ] do a cake walk into
the end zone here there's gonna be like
nothing so this goes to show you that
that anti intellectualism is pervasive
on the right it's not like it's just a
you know a tiny fringe of the right it
it's also like the establishment
politicians on the right who are
generally viewed in mainstream media I
was like no no they're acceptable like
ah Mitt Romney's acceptable Trump is
horrible but Romney's acceptable he's up
his own ass and he's in his own world
and he's unable to view reality
objectively cuz the poll showed the
opposite as well I mean that's another
important point is that the polls in the
MIT Romney versus Obama race they had
Obama up the overwhelming majority of
the time but he was still so convinced
there was gonna be a cakewalk even on
the [ __ ] night of the election they
thought he was gonna win so I thought
that was amazing it was seriously is
amazing that he thought I can't lose
this okay the other thing is repeatedly
in the documentary he made the point
that was that big scam remember what he
said all 47% of the country's gonna vote
for Obama no matter what and they're
gonna want their free stuff and they're
gonna take from the producers and all
that he said that repeatedly behind the
scenes of the Netflix documentary where
he basically said oh the path were going
down we're gonna have the rich people
taxed too much and free stuff given
everybody else unbelievable that that's
his framing it's like no [ __ ] we have
as of right now the richest 6 people
have more wealth than the bottom 50% of
the world combined
we have record levels of wealth and
income inequality I mean we're talking
about one family the Walton family six
people they have more than 40% of the
United States combined and we could you
know go through fact after fact half of
workers in America make $30,000 a year
or less and this guy looks at this
current political climate an economic
climate and he's like ah we gotta give
the rich guy another break and all of
these
all these moochers and parasites they
just want free stuff and he said that
over and over behind the scenes like oh
my god look at the path we're going on
he thinks he's some sort of savior by
stepping in and saying I'm gonna defend
the rich people I mean the the level and
degree to which just run-of-the-mill
politicians on the right have bought
into this ridiculous Iran framing of the
situation is comical so it's funny
because when he got caught with the 47%
comment
he basically oh my god I'm gonna clarify
it I'm gonna backpedal - say this I'm
gonna say that but no he really believes
that and in the documentary that's
proven because he kept saying it over
and over he also was obsessing over like
the tax the specific tax rate for rich
people he was citing some you know
article on whatever daily call or
something like that and saying oh when
you account for all the money this um
you guys still see me okay I just got
the low battery thing that's not good
[Music]
okay I just plugged it in hopefully that
will work now um so he was obsessing
over the tax rate like oh my god there's
some people in like New York or
California or whatever all told they
would end up paying sixty five percent
of their money the government again I
find that framing so misleading because
what he doesn't tell you is well how
much money do these people actually
taking home and these are of course big
business owners and big business owners
you know they could you know maybe some
dude makes thirty five million dollars a
year but Mitt Romney's framing of it is
not holy [ __ ] this guy's taking home
thirty five million dollars a year you
know lucky him he can get basically
whatever he wants and he's rich beyond
his wildest imagination and he doesn't
have to worry about money from now until
he dies his framing is but oh my God
look at the [ __ ] rate he paid in
taxes and I'm at the point now where I
feel like any discussion of just the tax
rate without talking about the raw
income that they take home is
fundamentally misleading like that is
fundamentally misleading
to say
you know oh my god a 50% tax rate a 50%
tax rate how unreasonable is that well
guys it [ __ ] depends if somebody has
two billion dollars and you say okay I'm
gonna let you keep 1 billion of it and
I'm gonna go take the other billion and
give people health care and build roads
and give people an education and give
people pay vacation time by law I would
look at that and go that seems perfectly
reasonable to me the idea that just [ __ ]
harping away on that rate as if that's
the whole conversation
I honestly think that's stupid like it's
is it that easy to mislead people we're
all you got to do is focus on the rate
and then they think oh that's that's it
that's the first and last data point I
need in the conversation and then the
the final thing about the Romney
documentary is there's one point where
he [ __ ] repeatedly about being called
out for flip-flopping and I thought that
we have some important updates on Jamal
khashoggi I hope I'm pronouncing that
right although I mess it up every other
day he's of course the Saudi journalist
killed by Saudi Arabia we also have some
load some responses to share with you
but first let's go to the hill they
report the following an individual
suspected of being part of the group of
Saudis involved in the death of
journalist Jamal khashoggi was
reportedly seen around Istanbul wearing
Yogi's clothes a fake beard and glasses
on the day of the killing
CNN citing a senior Turkish official
reported that the man in the video
identified as Mustafa al-madani was
captured by surveillance cameras leaving
the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on the
day khashoggi died there he appears to
be wearing the same clothes Khashoggi
was seen wearing when he entered the
consulate Turkish investigators have
said they have audio and other evidence
that proves Khashoggi was killed and
dismembered by a group of Saudis in the
consulate the Turkish official told CNN
that al-madani was used as a body double
in the operation so what we're looking
at here is and this really you know
really struck me that it's so concerted
and so organized and so planned that it
really seems like like a smoke-filled
back room in a way and I always try to
avoid the smoke-filled back room
conspiracies whenever possible but this
is one of those instances where you're
like the dude wore a fake beard I mean
that is wild so Trump is waffling on
this and he's saying I would love it if
NBS didn't do it and he's basically you
know trying to play both sides and
pretend like he's tough on crime but at
the same time trying to keep the
us-saudi alliance intact and yeah it's
just a mess
so explain why it is that they would use
the body double was it the Saudis
attempts to make it seem as though
Khashoggi had left the consulate yes
yeah so two natural conclusions come out
of that right one part is surprising
though so the natural conclusions are if
you bring a bone saw and an autopsy
expert and a body double it wasn't
something that happened by accident
right over end of this it's not even
close that's super obvious if the bone
saw for some insane reason
not convince you because you watch Fox
News or something well the body Devils
got to do it doesn't it
I mean who brings a body double to an
accidental killing that's a big so
second conclusion which actually haunts
me in some ways more is I I don't think
they could have possibly have known what
Khashoggi was going to wear that and so
I believe that is Khashoggi x' actual
clothes yeah I think they took it off of
them before they kill him because they
obviously doesn't have blood on him and
remember they likely chopped off his
fingers while he was still alive so
likely they stripped him naked tortured
him and it's all on audio apparently so
the Turkish government has that they
keeps threatening to use it and release
it in fact they say they're gonna
release it tomorrow so we'll see and so
naked tortured parts of his body chopped
off and then killed and then beheaded
and dismembered we believe but we're not
positive about the order we don't know
if they beheaded him to kill him
so anyone trying to say that this was
not premeditated is an obvious obvious
liar well thankfully the moral voice of
our generation pat robertson has some
thoughts on this for us so let's take a
look at that now said now and I'll say
it over and over again we've got the
cooler rhetoric and what the president
is trying to do is to give the Saudis
and out and calls for sanctions and
calls for punitive action against the
Saudis is not is ill-advised and Wendy I
just don't think you've got a hundred
billion dollars worth of arm sales which
is you know that's one of those things
but more than that we've got to have
some Arab allies we have to have it we
cannot alienate a biggest player in the
Middle East whose bulwark against Iran
can we have somebody that's killing
journalists that are US residents is the
question yeah you know we've had so many
people killed I mean he had CIA people
eleven and they people have been taking
houses here over the years I know it's
bad but I mean we've had all kinds of
stuff but you don't blow up an
international alliance over one person I
mean I'm sorry oh what a great Christian
thoughts are on reproductive rights
right when it comes to zygotes I'm sure
he's very much concerned about you know
being pro-life but when it comes to
living breathing human beings who happen
to be journalists who get murdered well
you know these things happen what are
you gonna do I mean there was some CIA
people at some time in the past you know
that's that's a great point Anna and I
hadn't thought about it in that context
imagine if the Saudis had committed an
abortion on purpose would Pat Robertson
see it completely differently wait a
minute I didn't know the Saudis were
that terrible
they're killing what they would consider
to be people before they're born after
they're born dismembering them and
beheading them is perfectly fine if you
got an arms deal at stake but before
they're bored that's an outrage before
they're an actual person oh my god we
got to protect him
I I don't know but there actually is no
bounce to Robertson's hypocrisy so he
might even say oh they did an abortion
what's one abortion when we got an arms
deal yeah look
imagine if he applied that logic back in
the day to the guy who started his
religion yeah I mean we got to deal with
the Roman Empire what's one guy compared
to a gigantic deal with we have with the
biggest empire in the world I mean this
one little guy from Nazareth what does
he matter I liked how he ignores all of
the parts of the Bible that are just
pacifist you know and this really shows
that he puts political ideology above
everything else and it shows that he'll
fall in line behind Donald Trump come
hell or high water because he actually
views him kind of as his demigod more
than he used the words of his own Lord
and Savior so I find this it's just
strange to me that you can have
Christians who are really good people
you know like dr. Martin Luther King jr.
for example who use the message of the
Bible for all the right reasons then you
could also get the polar opposite
philosophy to the point where it's
comical mm-hmm
I don't even think pat robertson is
trying to preach anything from the Bible
anymore
and after Trump got elected you're right
he does see Trump as this God figure in
fact he thinks that Donald Trump was
chosen by God to be president he has now
become you know another propaganda arm
of the Trump administration in addition
to Fox News so Jake you know just to
answer the question of whether or not he
would be upset if the Saudis had forced
an abortion I don't think he would be
upset because I do think that politics
go above anything else including his
so-called religious beliefs but Pat
Robertson actually doubled down after
getting criticized for this and he used
the same talking point that Trump uses
which is no but you guys don't
understand the Saudi arms deal is
important because of jobs ok that is a
lie and I wanted to look into that that
claim and actually give you guys some of
the numbers so first off how many jobs
does the US defense industry employ
about 355,000 so Trump claims
oh no this this specific Saudi arms deal
has led to 500,000 jobs in in typical
Trump fashion he keeps changing the
numbers to suit whatever point he's
trying to make so back in January of
this year when MBS was in visiting in
Washington Trump had claimed that this
Saudi arms deal was going to provide
about 40 thousand new jobs fast-forward
to today
with this whole khashoggi controversy
all of a sudden just to justify selling
weapons to Saudi Arabia he's now saying
five hundred thousand there have been
some cases where he's said six hundred
thousand so how many jobs is it it's
certainly not six hundred thousand not
500,000 and again just to emphasize or
re-emphasize the US defense industry
employs three hundred fifty five
thousand five hundred jobs for the
entire industry exactly and by the way
he said on now dozens of occasions it's
a hundred billion dollar deal it's 110
billion dollar deal it's fourteen and a
half billion I mean you could say
fourteen and a half billion that's still
a lot of money right no but he's got an
embellished she has the embellish on the
number
on the jobs and in the amount of money
that would come in and then Pat Roberts
is of the world of course I'm
questioningly unquestioningly have his
bank i was also amused they had
prosperity gospel preacher paula white
on in a different situation in pat
robertson's channel talking about how
well if you look at the bible it appears
that jesus is an immigrant but he's not
he's not he never broke any of the laws
okay and he did he have documents was
undocumented right he's also brown by
the way which you know i don't think
they're very comfortable with that fact
right if he existed at all i should say
he's brown that's the reason in the
world he's from that's right they twist
everything to try to fit their political
agenda and their political agenda has
nothing to do with the teachings of
jesus christ
now speaking of political agenda i have
one more video for you i think you're
gonna like this rush limbaugh also
weighed in on this take a look i
continue to get emails about these the
so-called Washington Post journalist
Jamal khashoggi my question is a really
rather simple one where was this concern
for our ambassador and three other men
brutally murdered in Benghazi and
Hillary Clinton's reaction what
difference does it make now she said the
in frustration this is anybody see a
disparity here in proportion where was
this concern everywhere I don't know
about you guys but I saw Benghazi
absolutely everywhere and it's weird
because he's saying this in service of
the point
okay let's ignore the kesaji thing
because let's not go after Donald Trump
yeah so we had about twenty eight
hearings on Benghazi so that that's one
of your answers second of all there was
no armed steel or other relationship we
had to the people who did the killings
in Benghazi if there was we all would
have been massively in favor of cutting
off that arms deal they killed our
ambassador they killed three other
people that's terror
does anybody think we had a relationship
with those guys no the made up charges
the Republican said at the time is that
somehow the Democrats should have known
about the attack and the terrorists
intentions ahead of time and then
afterwards should have said other words
about it but no one claims that we had a
secret deal with the people who did the
killings in this case we have a giant
the other devil Trump won't shut up
about what the guys who did the killings
that's a massive difference of course
you have to assume if you're Rush
Limbaugh that your audience is not that
bright so you'll be able to escape that
by them including the incredibly
obnoxious beginning to that that's
so-called Washington Post journalist
what's the so called part of it he wrote
for the Washington Post he was a
calmness for them for a year and now you
just want to smear the guy in every
imaginable way and I honestly don't care
who or what he was anyway exactly he was
dismembered by the Saudi government
which seems to be the you know the big
point there so and now finally let's go
to that issue right so these same guys
Pat Robertson Rush Limbaugh Donald Trump
are the ones who told you the Muslims
are the problem we got we got to keep
him out of the country until we figure
out what the hell's going on and I mean
rush limbaugh how many segments that he
knew about the evil Muslims now I would
add fundamentalist Muslims but that's a
distinction we make that's not even a
distinction of Rush Limbaugh or Pat
Robertson makes or Donald Trump but I
mean if you were talking about evil
fundamentalist Muslims it doesn't get
any more so than the Saudi leadership
and so not only it was that the case
before this killing but now Pat
Robertson and Rush Limbaugh are
defending the most extremist Islamic
fundamentalist that just beheaded and
dismembered someone get a load of that
twisted logic and a lot of their
followers are like well of course we're
of course Pro Muslim beheadings haven't
we said that all along yes that amazing
it is amazing and I think that this
whole story further proves that the
right wing only uses Muslims for the
sole purpose of fear-mongering that they
themselves know that the general Muslim
population doesn't really
as a threat to the United States doesn't
serve as a national security threat to
the United States what they do is
exploit people's fear to win elections
to spread propaganda to you know pass
anti-immigration legislation or at least
anti-immigration initiatives and so if
they were really concerned about the
damage that Muslims would do they would
be outraged by this but at the end of
the day it's all about the money it's
all about protecting political interests
it's all about covering up for Trump
helping Trump cover up for the Saudis I
mean it's a really disgusting story
especially when you consider the
precedent it sets for journalists period
I mean this says hey if you're a
journalist the US government will not
look out for you and will not you know
try to get justice on your behalf if you
get murdered by Saudi royals or any
other government especially if there's a
financial interest to keep those ties
yes any government that we profit off of
right and in the case of Donald Trump he
actually has made this clear on several
occasions that to your point about
Muslims in general he said oh the Saudis
why would I be opposed to the Saudis
they pay me forty to fifty million
dollars for apartment of course I'm not
gonna be opposed to the Saudis he
literally said that he and if you don't
know this not only the Saudis switch as
soon as Donald Trump won the presidency
switch all their hotel rooms from other
hotels all the Trump properties I mean
this bribery is not is not veiled very
much I know the Saudis are into veiling
but apparently not bad but in some cases
they literally took out hotel rooms
giant blocks of hotel rooms in Trump
hotels and never went there just Prime's
its bribes out in the open and Trump
says why would I be opposed to the
Saudis they keep paying of course I'm
not opposed to the Saudis oh it's non
rich Muslims that I'd like to fear
monger about while I actually have the
worst of the worst of fundamentalist
Muslims that pay me money so I like them
in fact in this case he said nobody's
told me he's responsible referring to
the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman or
as I'm calling him now bonesaw Salman he
said nobody's told me he's not
responsible we haven't reached that
point I would love if he wasn't
responsible yeah I would love if he
wasn't responsible
now the finally the thing that they're a
little agitated about is that the Saudis
bungled lying so badly that it's hard to
cover up for them they're dying to cover
up for them but it's may mean a really
hard one to the question I raised
originally if you had the body double
why didn't you use it as an alibi
like I don't know why they did the body
bonobo and then they didn't use it maybe
think it's just they're like oh yeah as
soon as it happened like oh that was a
really bad idea he's got an obviously
fake beard they immediately identify who
he is right
so I guess scrapped that plan and in the
beginning of course they said no he
walked out alive and the Saudi officials
officials said that saying no we know
for sure he walked out alive now when
they asked Donald Trump even he had a
tough time justifying that he had to
tell the Washington Post yeah that was
inconsistent you know why they bungled
it and why they didn't use the body
double because the Turks were
eavesdropping on the whole situation
like they had bugged the room and they
have you know based on what we know and
I am taking it at face value they say
they have the audio recordings of the
whole you know murder basically so and
other evidence they're gonna release it
tomorrow so if I were you know with the
Saudis if I were Saudi royalty and I
knew all about that all this I wouldn't
go to the body double because the body
double doesn't matter it's clear that
it's a body double if the Turks have the
evidence that they say they have yeah
now we know not only do they not care
about the genocide happening in Yemen
with our weapons they also don't care
about dead journalists exactly
so Steve Bannon did an interview with
sargon of akkad
and he spoke a little bit about populism
I want to watch this short clip here and
then I'll respond to it it could be the
difference in right-wing populism and
left wing populism is pretty
straightforward the the Corbin and
Bernie Sanders populism once more state
intervention once more state involvement
in every aspect of your life okay
right-wing populism and this is why I
said it's C pact with the first time I
spoke publicly when I said Trump's got
three prongs to his program economic
nationalism American first national
security and the third is the
deconstruction of the administrative
state what Trump and what right-wing
populist are trying to do is deconstruct
the state we do we're not anarchist and
we're not libertarian so we understand
there's got to be some sort of
regulations trade deals armed forces the
police all that we bind to that however
what what brytewave populism is is
basically a piece of the action for the
little guy he gets a better high-paying
job at a better wage it doesn't have to
compete against the world but Steve
Trump hasn't given a piece of the action
to the little guy now if he did I would
give him credit but I can't give him
credit cuz he hasn't done that take for
example his tax bill 83% of the benefits
of that bill go to the top one percent
that bill obliterates the corporate tax
rate it takes the nominal rate from
thirty five percent all the way down to
I think twenty one percent the estate
tax is destroyed in that bill so that
that's a tax on people with estates that
have I think what what does it apply you
over five million or over two million
bottom line is it's like the top less
than one percent of the cons like 0.1%
of the country that's who the estate tax
applies to they cut that so if you pass
a tax bill that guts taxes for the rich
and for corporations now that's a fact
that's what he did then how can you say
he's for the little guy I mean I guess
he could turn around and say well
unemployment is low but Steve wages are
stagnant so
there's a lot of low-wage job creation
now under Obama it was the same thing so
what I'm saying here is not partisan
what I'm saying here is just the reality
of the situation for the unemployment
rate under Obama yes it dropped
massively but it was low wage job
creation Donald Trump is continuing that
trend wage growth is not keeping pace
with inflation so the wages are still
stagnant Steve he's doing the same
policies as george w bush i mean let's
just call it what it is
he brags on Trump brags on a regular
basis about deregulating and he signed
in connected of order that was something
like Oh for everyone new regulation we
got to get two or three off the books
something like that the number may even
be higher than that he is trying to put
in charge of the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau somebody who would
handcuff the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau and not let them
actually you know detect fraud from big
financial institutions against working
people the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau has returned billions of dollars
to working people because they were
defrauded by giant corporations Trump is
handcuffing the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau
they've obliterated dodd-frank the mild
Wall Street regulation which should have
gone much further so Steve he's doing
the same policies as george w bush he's
doing trickle-down now if Steve were to
say to me hey man this is more about you
know what he's doing on the trade deals
even there it's been he's failed there's
been ninety-three thousand jobs
outsourced under Trump's first year as
president under Obama it was
eighty-seven thousand so he's even worse
than Obama and one of trumps main
arguments on the campaign trail was you
know I am um the guy who's gonna keep
your job here I'm against outsourcing
even his new NAFTA deal so I went into
reading that with an open mind I even
gave Trump credit for one or two of the
provisions because some of them were
decent like the dairy farm provision but
let's not kid ourselves the old NAFTA is
almost exactly like the new NAFTA Trump
tweaked a few provisions now he's
pretending it's the best trade deal ever
when the route of NAFTA is still there
so this idea of like I mean look what he
did with carrier mow I saved the jobs of
carrier tremendous unbelievable no end
up happening was he hoes taxpayers gave
gave them a giant corporate welfare
check they move towards automation
anyway and months later when nobody was
looking they outsource the jobs Steve
Madden Donald Trump is a fraud the only
question is now are you a fraud as well
so this idea of like oh it's for the
little guy I'm giving a it's it's to
help the right-wing populism is to give
a little piece to the little guy but
that hasn't happened that hasn't
happened so where's the disconnect here
I'll tell you where the disconnect is
Donald Trump is acting as a standard
Republican president his policies are in
favor of the establishment that's it
he's gone he's his policies fully
protect the elite that's the reality and
that shouldn't be surprised to anybody
when his administration was packed full
of goldman sachs people okay that
shouldn't be a surprise now when he says
there he says all the right-wing
populism is about economic nationalism
and then he said something like
protecting the security of the country
or something like that and he said
deconstructing the administrative state
but there's a problem there cuz two of
those are contradictory if you're an
economic nationalist then you can't be
for deconstructing the administrative
state why because the administrative
state even though you're trying to make
it sound like a boogeyman and evil and
bad and wrong if you're talking about
the administrative straight the state in
the sense of like regulating Wall Street
back when we had glass-steagall and we
had a more stable financial system for
example the administrative state has
positive aspects so for you to say oh
it's about economic nationalism which is
like oh let's care about our own country
first well then how can you also say
deconstructing the administrative state
is a good thing for looking out for the
well-being of our own people in our own
country because that'll actually hurt
our people it'll lead to more crashes
and then also the idea of being an
economic nationalist you would hope that
means all a big infrastructure deal look
I'm in favor that I've been pushing that
like crazy a new New Deal
here's the problem Trump hasn't done a
new New Deal
our infrastructure still gets a grade of
D plus and the only proposal he made was
a [ __ ] privatization scheme where you
privatize large swaths of our
infrastructure which is a terrible idea
so again it's like this bannon's
argument for right-wing populism in
practice ends up just being standard
elitists republic the Republican
politics so it's it's kind of amazing
that he's still maintaining this brand
and still promoting Trump may be one
thing if Bannon was like hey man
Trump has turned his back on my vision
okay well then at least I would take you
seriously and that you have a different
ideology Steve but you don't because
you're still Cheerilee being a
cheerleader for Trump as he's acting
like George W Bush all right final point
and this is the part that really pissed
me off more believe it or not I know
I've been rambling for a while now but
he said left-wing populist and he
references Bernie Sanders and Jeremy
Corbyn he says left-wing populist want
to have more content to have more
control in quote every aspect of your
life that's [ __ ] that's not true so
for example Bernie Sanders was one of
very few politicians in the United
States of America to vote against the
Patriot Act now that's not a little
thing it's not like oh sure in that one
little area you know Bernie's for less
government that's a giant thing that's
Bernie Sanders saying I don't agree with
unconstitutional warrantless spying on
all Americans and I'm going to stand up
against that that is Bernie Sanders
saying in a very crucial and key area I
want significantly less government
I don't want an Orwellian state where
they can spy on you for any reason at
all without a warrant illegally that's a
huge point and he said in quote every
aspect of your life left-wing populist
want government to control you that's
Bernie saying on one of the most
issues I want do not want government to
control you I want less government more
Bernie is for ending the drug war and
legalizing marijuana again that's not a
little thing Steve it's not like wow
there's just his little area he's for
smaller government that's a giant area
though drug Wars cost over a trillion
dollars how many people's lives have
been ruined by the drug war Bernie
Sanders is one of the first politicians
in America
somebody was actual institutional power
to say let's legalize tax and regulate
marijuana for recreational use
so let's legalize that and let's end the
drug war that is less government that's
not more government see he's in order to
paint the populace left as unreasonable
he has to strawman that's the point
because what does he know he knows that
the populace left is for every single
economic provision and and policy that
actually improved the lives of the
little guy he knows that so how does he
distinguish himself from the populist
left if he knows that therefore all the
right policies that will help the little
guy he has to lie about what they did
what their stand is on social issues oh
the populist left wants to increase
government and quote every aspect of
your life
utter nonsense utter [ __ ] Steve and
you know that's [ __ ] he voted
against the Patriot Act he's not in
favor the drug war he's also by the way
for getting the government out of your
life on reproductive choices now I don't
know what Steve Maddens belief is on the
issue of abortion but I can guarantee
you Bernie's for very little government
in that realm so not for more government
for less government in many areas and
you know listen I'm one of I don't even
know if Bernie accepts the label
populist left I think it's a fair way to
describe him but I don't even know if he
accepts it you know who one of the few
people on the left is that does accept
that label in fact who promotes that
label me I'm one of the few people who
who says I am populist left and I'll
tell you right now not only do I agree
with Bernie on the issue of the Patriot
Act and agree with him on the issue of
the drug war and legalizing marijuana
and we mostly agree on the issue of
abortion but also I would add to that
list that I would legalize prostitute
I would legalize gambling I would
legalize Death with Dignity which is
physician assisted suicide so what are
we talking about here we're talking
about one two three four five six seven
I just gave you seven areas seven areas
where the populace left is for less
government in your life in fact on
social issues libertarian hey hey live
and let live so it's not when you say
the populous left wants more government
control in every aspect your life that's
not true and that's I haven't even
gotten into the fact that the framing of
that is nonsense anyway because like so
when I say I'm for a Medicare for All
system does that mean I want the
government to have more control of your
life when it comes to health care no it
just means I want a medicare-for-all
system I want everybody covered I want
to cut the [ __ ] cost in half which we
will do and I want to eliminate medical
bankruptcies there's nothing like
tyrannical about health care so for him
to phrase it as like oh that's the
populace left wants the government to
have control in every aspect of your
life no I want better healthcare and the
way to achieve that is through a
single-payer system so even the framing
is [ __ ] sketchy and weird and wrong
and the final point is this man I
pointed this out before Obama do it
again now listen one of the aspects of
Steve bannon's so-called populism is he
has a hardline stance on immigration and
I remember on his radio show he said he
was in a conversation with Donald Trump
this was when Trump was a candidate and
Trump was saying hey I want a
merit-based immigration system and you
know we want the best people that's what
we want and Steve Bannon even disagreed
with that Steve Madden was basically
saying hey man we're creating a culture
here so it's not even about like maybe
let's stop that he didn't flat-out say
this but it was there
hey we should stop allowing in the brown
people whether they be refugees whether
they be immigrants because we're
creating a culture so even if you have a
merit-based system and let's say we get
a lot of people from India or we get a
lot of people from wherever places where
people are brown or black Steve banning
goes not only am i against illegal
immigration I'm also kind of against
illegal immigration if there are certain
kinds of
legal immigrants now if I'm wrong about
that and Steve Bannon has and I'm being
too harsh on Steve Bannon more than
willing to be corrected if he comes out
and he says that's not true totally fine
with black and brown immigrants no
problem with them whatsoever and I am
for a merit-based immigration system if
Steve Bryan comes don't say that fine
I'll do a correction I have no problem
doing that none at all
but my guess is he won't correct me
because that is what he believes so it's
a form of white nationalism now that is
you're not a populist there's nothing
about that that's populist that's not
the populist position if you talk to the
American people and look at the polls
they don't want to they don't want to
take that position on immigration so you
the funny thing is as he claims to be
populist he's using the oldest trick in
the book that the elites use and what
trick is that don't look at the rich
don't look at the corporation's don't
look at the billionaires don't look at
the rigging of the system don't look at
the money in politics the real problem
mr. working-class white dude is those
poor immigrant brown folks who are
coming in the country and ruining your
life and that's [ __ ] that's nonsense
that's not true it's just simply not
true that those are the people who have
led to the problems in our society now
I'm not saying you can't have a
different opinion from me on immigration
I have a rather moderate position on
immigration but it is not true to say
that there's such a problem focus on
that it's not true so at the very least
you're doing the bidding of the elites
more likely you're actually also serving
the elites and you know that you're
serving the elites as you play this game
of divide and conquer by pitting regular
people against each other while the rich
run out the back door with all the money
you're not a populist
[Applause]
well it seems like you don't mean an
introduction these two do you you're
gonna get a short one anyway
Kyle kolinsky is a left-wing radio host
social democratic political commentator
and the co-founder of the political
organization Justice Democrats when it
can be shorter you get to the
conversation
please welcome Kyle kolinsky
and to his left is the weekday and
weeknight host on Russia I should say RT
America Scottie Nell Hughes say this
kind of put it on to the whole bio but
it doesn't make sense so let's get to it
who is witty is President Trump winning
how should we measure well we're going
to find out in just a second let's start
with the economy if we listen to the
president he says it's the best economy
in the history of this country we can
point to he will point to low
unemployment job grow the stock market
stock market up into maybe a week ago or
so it's the president winning on the
economy I will start with you Kyle first
okay so first of all I just want to say
thank you to Scottie no use for
accepting this
I think the setups a little funny
because I feel like we're making draft
picks or something like this is an NBA
yeah 2030 so she works for Artie and I
feel like Artie's a little unfairly
maligned in today's political climate
and there's some wonderful folks at
Artie the late great ed Schultz was
there Tom Hartman and so that's another
point I wanted to make real quick before
I hop into the substance is that I feel
like there's a lot of the treatment of
Artie has been unfair for many in the
establishment video and the fact that
you work for them I don't find that bad
disqualifying in any way shape or form
and I just wanted to say that as well so
um as far as the economy goes is Donald
Trump winning on the economy well you're
not gonna be surprised to learn that my
answer is no he's not winning on the
economy at all so I was one of very few
people on on the Left who actually gave
Trump a lot of credit when he was
campaigning because I actually think on
many issues he was more populist in his
rhetoric than Hillary Clinton he would
go to the Rust Belt and he would talk
about how NAFTA has been terrible for
working people he would rail against the
TPP and he was a rare Republican who
would say he wasn't going to cut Social
Security and Medicare and I thought that
that really helped him win the fact that
it was about 70,000 votes in the Rust
Belt that really led to his victory I
mean that was even though Hillary won by
a few million votes overall in the
country was really 70,000 votes in the
Rust Belt that made it so that Donald
Trump won and it doesn't help that
Hillary Clinton was like tepidly against
the trade deals after Bernie Sanders
kind of forced her to that position but
when it comes to Trump's record it
doesn't match the rhetoric on the
campaign trail so one fact I always
bring up is that there were 93 thousand
jobs that have been outsourced in his
first year as president that's actually
an increase under Obama there were 87
thousand jobs outsourced and so I don't
defend either one of their records on
that front I think yeah if you run as
the anti outsourcing president you
should implement anti outsourcing
policies and he simply hasn't done that
the
and rate being low it's actually a very
misleading thing when people bring that
up as if it's evidence that oh he's
doing well on the economy because that's
really not a very good economic
indicator wages is a much better
economic indicator and real wages are
falling they're not keeping up with
inflation even when Trump protected to
do good things like I'm going to save
the carrier jobs what ended up happening
was a few months later they shipped the
jobs overseas anyway and they moved
towards automation and on top of that
they got a giant corporate welfare check
so if anything that's worse on trade
policy so I think I'll leave it at that
for now but that's my thoughts on trade
trade in the economy it's good so let me
give my starting off first of all thank
you for being so kind and say the reason
why I accepted this is because your
opinions matter even if you don't I
don't agree with them your opinions
matter for far too long this country the
Republican Party didn't care about it
Nayla didn't care they stopped you in
the face with them and just completely
ignored you and I think the problem
we're at this state in the country today
is because we've stopped talking to each
other
we run separate ways we find ways to
demonize the other side and instead of
trying to figure out how we can work
together what works well for us we would
rather just throw lewd comments and be
vicious against the other side and guess
where that gets us absolutely nowhere
which is where we are today and I think
that's where
this is I supported Trump out of the
gate for one reason and one reason only
he wasn't Hillary Clinton and I could
not imagine this kind of tree underneath
her
I'm sorry whether you're playing there
the woman scared me and that was back in
2014 she was a woman that I think was
going to do extreme detriment because
just like so many elitist across both
sides of the aisle she could care less
about the little man she could care less
about the guy that's worked in three
different jobs the woman that is trying
to speak for kids by herself she didn't
care about it while she cared about was
her fat cats on Wall Street and just
like Kyle pointed out that's what Trump
campaigned against and Ed Schultz was
one of my delayed credentials was what
my mentors Tom Hartman taught me listen
we can disagree I mean both of those are
extremely amazing gentlemen and it's
such an honor to sit in ed Schultz
position every night and I have done
nothing to change his soul for his show
since it passed because he told me in
the reason why you picked me was because
I had no problem at the network that I
was on calling out that Network for
giving Hillary Clinton the debate
questions against Bernie Sanders I had
no problem calling out say that they had
stacked the cards against Bernie Sanders
that it was it I think the truth was
they underestimated how powerful the
Bernie Sanders supporters are and this
does have a lot to do with it kind of
because that's a big group of people at
the same group of people that helped
vote Trump in and it was on one issue a
big issues they just wanted to provide
for their family and they were tired of
seeing their jobs go across seas and go
across the border bad deals that both
Republicans and Democrat fat cats in
Washington had made and I had agreed
with Bernie on that so now we come here
today to
years later I don't say this at least we
did get NAFTA repealed replaced what's
all in it I'm optimistic we saw our
trade imbalance go through there five
hundred billion dollar trade about to go
through the roof for two reasons when we
let China the World Trade Organization
and two we put NAFTA in and that
outsourced our jobs
and we lost jobs and build America which
is where I'm from so you know I have to
say it's Trump winning on the economy
I'll give him more credit in this area
that other areas does you have a lot of
work to do
absolutely I still think that when it
comes to economy guess we're see you
know it I love that Wall Street's doing
well way to go for all the sex with
Avenue and Goldman Sachs people that
work at his administration congratz of
either making money but that doesn't
mean that you and I are feeling any
better on pockets the tax breaks were
good there would they helpfully to super
confidence and optimism that's always
good people always feel better when they
see boring their pipe more money their
paycheck but is it short-lived so he's
doing better on that than he's doing a
lot of others I think of all of the
issues were going to talk today that's
the highest ranking you should get the
rest of them who definitely gonna have a
lot to debate on or what Lodge talk so I
think that Trump governing Trump is very
different from campaigning Trump and
governing Trump I I often say that I
think Donald Trump really wants to be
Hillary Clinton because Hillary Clinton
gets the pat on the back from the
establishment and the elites and Wall
Street and I think that Donald Trump you
know he ran against those factions deep
down he wants to be like Hillary Clinton
so you referenced NAFTA their NAFTA 2.0
is very similar to the original NAFTA
there's maybe one or two decent
provisions in there like for our dairy
farmers but ultimately there's a giant
giveaway to Big Pharma in there so it he
ran against NAFTA and I predicted he
would do this like oh I'm gonna do some
tremendous trade deals they're gonna be
unbelievable
let me just tell you compression thank
you NAFTA 2.0 ended up being very
similar to the original NAFTA and with
Trump
I feel very similar to like I do with
Obama in that both of those presidents
had a uniquely anti-establishment
mandate where they were supposed to
really almost blow up the system and
start from scratch and really fight for
the people but especially under the
truck administration did not happen at
all so I would say he's been in more
than a litter losing beyond those and
let me just do one more fact to back
that up the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau has returned 11 or 12
billion dollars to defrauded Americans
giant financial institutions screwing
people over he picked a former predatory
payday lender to lead the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau so that
tells you everything you need to know
about Donald Trump well and one more
thing it doesn't matter if you think
that the economy is doing right I think
this is something it matters about each
individual person if you don't have a
job if you can't find a job if you can't
cover your electric bill if you can't
get to work because you've had to sell
your car to pay for your doctor's bills
the economy's not doing good for you and
we should live in a country where every
individual matters not just this grand
house or the grand elitist which is
where we've come to focus on you to a
bit very nice and respectful to each
other see a five victories I think
you're gonna be surprised no I think
there's a stark contrast as far as the
perception of this president will be
successful on these issues so let me
piss on your Cheerios real quick let's
go to immigration sure it's the
president succeeding and I guess we need
to define what success is is he winning
on the issue of immigration you can
define that however you want
get out of the way know the one fact
that I'll bring up about immigration
that really really concerns me is that
there's been a giant increase in
deportations of non criminal
undocumented immigrants and I think that
really exposes that you're not
humanitarian you don't care about people
you don't you don't respect the fact
that many people will come to this
country or citizens seriously just
trying to create a better life and you
see oftentimes on the far right this
demagoguery of immigrants and I think
that's totally vacuous and vapid and
they're actually doing the work of the
elites because the oldest trick in the
book
is where elites get working-class white
people to hate poor brown and black
people and they say they're the reason
that you know you're struggling and the
reality is no the rich people are
running out the back door with all the
money and rigging the system against
both of you immigration I think both
parts of me who here actually thinks the
Republicans or the Democrats want to
solve immigration neither party wants us
all because it works really well for
them I mean look at this we had this
caravan of mostly people who are fleeing
for their lives they're scared they're
coming up they're trying to seek asylum
and yet Democrats are saying hey
definitely you know there it's gonna
it's gonna get that base we're three
weeks out from the midterm this is great
because guess what this is gonna make
people say that you know the idea that
families could be separated at the
border that speaks well that gets people
to the polls to vote for me the
Republicans go absolutely please come on
let's have this be headlines because
then for sure the Republicans interpret
I don't want them in my country cuz
there are all just horrible people so
you know if Congress when to solve
immigration it's not hard it takes
common sense there's no reason why the
good countries in central South America
America and Canada could not all work
together so you know we have
prompt these refugees fleeing for their
lives how about we actually send them
proper proper air and proper groups to
the countries that can hold on to them
you know that Costa Rica can you take 50
Canada can you take 200 let's actually
get a solution to this problem and here
in America the fact that you have to pay
hundreds of thousands of dollars
sometimes just to become an American
citizen and it takes 10 years that's
ridiculous that's not what this country
was founded on sure we want to know who
you are that are here and that you
actually want to add to America but we
also want to celebrate diversity and the
reason why I hope we have a lot of these
people being jumping these boards it's
not because they don't want to be here
just because they can't get in here and
so let's make it simplified for those
that really want to be here provide
better for their families let's simplify
if we can simplify our taxes every April
and we can simplify the application to
become an American citizen let me ask
you this to be a father
if all that you say is true and I will
accept it as true
has the president improved or worsened
the situation visa vie immigration I
think the president unfortunately has
not had a shocky not the right verbage I
think across the board he's not enhanced
the conversation that we need to be
having about diversity in this con in
this country do you think he's a white
nationalist deep down they say this I
have a real hard time hate it's horrible
across the board and I haven't real hard
time pointing out somebody that I don't
calling anybody any names that are that
hateful can I say that some of his
policies definitely could have fringes
of it absolutely those are wrong but I
don't you know I wouldn't call someone
but I don't know 24/7 to how what their
actions are that way that see that that
doesn't help the conversation of it and
here here's the other side of it whether
you know his actions are positive or not
it doesn't help the rest of us that's
the prom' we have date we're too busy
pointing out you know what you're
someone that's racist okay how does that
solve the problem that's when we all go
to our separate corners we don't talk to
each other we bloomy
I mean I think every single one of us
here at some point I've been labeled
something that's not nice and it's not
correct I know I have so when we sit
there and put those labels on all that
does make us retreat to our little
places and we never have that
conversation I understand what you're
saying and I largely agree with it but
all I'll say is there is a time in place
for name-calling when it's factually
accurate and oftentimes you see people
kind of I feel like the far right
oftentimes even though they accused the
left of being snowflakes
there ain't no Twinkie on their order on
our side
yeah and I'm not just talking about the
color of the skin mostly that exact
reason is why cowardly Coulter as we now
call there was never a hesitation when
they called me on when they called me an
ass yes I know that and you've been very
and it was because I want to listen I'll
be the persons with my I'm not a truck
administration I'll admit when I'm wrong
and I will apologize when I'm wrong I
don't fit the real trump mold I guess
listen to you and that your opinions
really do matter because guess what it's
telling Kyle the reason why you have
your opinions is because something in
your life shaped it and that was
something very important and that does
not does not need to be ignored anymore
before we drift you for our field still
the question remains as the president
won advance his agenda as it relates to
immigration or immigration reform or has
moved us in the direction where the
country will largely reject what he
wants to do with immigration /
immigration reform the president all he
has to almost you got to give him this
whether you agree with it or not he was
almost completed everything almost
everything he completed on at least to
his satisfaction except for one thing
which is building a wall you build one
chip of that wall and I don't know if
he's running for reelection in 2020
because then you say look I've built a
wall so in his opinion in is he advanced
his agenda sure does that mean that
that's all those pieces of the gin is
best thing for America it's for you guys
to decide oh yeah I mean it's like the
wall issue I just I find it so stupid
because it's not that's not going to
solve any problem the ideally we have to
keep the criminals out of here that's
what we have to do well if you want to
lower the amount of violent crime in the
drug war and the drug war
what happen is because we saw this with
prohibition when alcohol was illegal
there was a giant spike in violent crime
because you have the Mafia underground
selling the product and they get power
and they get money and then right now
it's the same with the drug cartels so
if you legalize tax and regulate
marijuana and decriminalize all drugs
you'll see a giant decrease in the
amount of violent program ok comment on
this this is the one thing I respect
your your choice I get that my husband
is a comma he was diagnosed 228 glaucoma
would help my friend my mother has lung
cancer he would actually you know it
would help relieve a lot of their pain
where my issue comes with what you do in
your own home or your home bedroom that
isn't your call I don't care you know if
it's okay I hate opioid that it is your
choice I am very libertarian get the
government out of as much as I can what
I have a problem with the things and in
marijuana has to fall in this category
but any drugs that might alter my
judgment or your judgment that's gonna
be in a car next to my children when I'm
driving I still want to make sure
alcohol the same way too sir we do we
need to encourage responsible ownership
of everything from a gun to a joint to a
dollar would you ban alcohol of them one
thing we need to encourage responsible
ownership okay but the same with
marijuana right so allow people to make
their own decisions but encourage them
to be responsible I think it's a Tenth
Amendment right I think it's every state
should make the defendant for themselves
and if I live in a state the decides
they want to legalize marijuana and I
is the perfect venue to have a panel
discussion on how the f are we going to
get along in this country and starting
here at Politico so we've got a great
roster of panelists today I want you to
give a big political welcome to all of
our panels just bring them out
[Applause]
all right so some quick introductions
here
first of all to my four right we host a
secular talk on The Young Turks Network
it is the last we have Safari sellers
who is a former state representative in
South Carolina now a CNN contributor to
his left we have the roaming millennial
aka watershed and she is the host of
building millennial uncensored on
YouTube and then to my left we have my
candles place of the Michael Miller show
on
y're and to his left we know Charlie
Parra founder so just to frame this
discussion for a second year we
obviously live in very polarized times
today our political rhetoric is as
divisive as it's been probably in our
lifetimes and just to put a finer point
on the level polarization today studies
have shown that the levels of
partisanship partisan polarization in
Congress are at the widest they have
been since the end of Reconstruction and
you only have to look to the headlines
in this country to see just how divided
this country is and I think in my view
that partisanship has really
metastasized into tribalism today so I
hope with the panel we can talk about
you know how we do bridge the political
divide in a media environment where it's
very difficult to do it and I think all
the panelists here are on the cutting
edge of new media and so it's really
going to be on the folks here to figure
out how we can create a more
constructive political dialogue and so I
actually want to start with Bakari
because you had transitioned from a
governance role having served in the
state legislature of South Carolina you
are the nominee for lieutenant governor
and was a 2014 2014 and so you are in
the business of trying to form
legislation and work with both Democrats
and Republicans in the legislature and
then you transition to a commentating
role at CNN and a number of other
platforms so tell us more about that
transition that process and the change
in incentives that you found in terms of
the type of political dialogue that
would
that would work well first thank you for
the question thank you all for being
here I was very young when I ran for
office and so I know we have some people
in here on the left and the far left I
know we have some people in here on the
right and the far right but I firmly
believe that we are not the generation
of tomorrow with a generation of now and
so I encourage everyone here when I was
21 years old I announced my race for
office I ran against somebody who was 82
years old and had been in office for 26
years and on June 13 2006 I became the
youngest black elected official in the
United States and the youngest state
legislator
the reason that I was able to do that is
because regardless of how someone looked
regardless of where someone came from
whether zip code I always gave people
the benefit of their humanity and I
think if we start there if we meet
people where they are and then we can
find initiatives that all of us can
agree on to have Charlie to my left and
to have my good friends and The Young
Turks to the to my right I can honestly
say that if we were to put forth an idea
like making sure that we take
redistricting which is the reason that
we're so polarized today out of the
hands of elected officials and made them
independent independent commissions
statewide and I can actually get these
two to agree on that and push it in
state legislatures around matter so but
it but it takes those type of bold steps
it takes people not getting caught up in
petty differences and it also takes
people understanding the practical
reality of where we are in this country
I tell people we made a lot of progress
but we still have yet a ways to go yeah
well just to pick up on that issue of
gerrymandering and
ordinance of our generation a lot of
people don't realize this but in the
state of Ohio this year
I run a nonpartisan organization called
the Millennial Action project we work
with young elected officials across the
aisle and it was the young lawmakers in
Ohio who pushed a bipartisan plan to put
in place for additional inform in Ohio
to get rid of partisan gerrymandering
and it passed with wide bipartisan
support the voters approved it with 75%
of the vote and I think that just
underscores the opportunity our
generation has to transcend from the old
divide so than holding our country back
and since you called Oh out Charlie on
it move over to Charlie here you've been
working on college campuses across the
country what's the sense that you're
picking up from college students today
in terms of the type of rhetoric that
they're looking for when I go to college
campuses for example I hear so many
young people who say I'm so tired of the
partisanship I'm so tired of all the
gridlock and I'm curious if you hear a
similar thing and out folks and
turning-point are responding yeah I I
agree at that I think the good news
politically about our generations I
think we agree generally on the problem
to do a lot of different perspectives on
how we would go about solving them the
broad-based consensus amongst college
students and Millennials is that we have
a government that does not represent our
generation that is run by trial lawyers
lobbyists well
people around a 90-mile proximity of
Washington DC our argument has a
conservative libertarians is well if
that government has been bought and is
corrupt why on earth would want to make
that government bigger stronger sent
more money that very same government and
that's obviously where my progressive
French friends would disagree so the the
broad-based question here over the last
3040 years is why has the wealth power
money and influence concentrated around
our nation's capital what do they create
well they create nothing they create
access to power I mean the wealthiest
counties in America used to be around in
Detroit Michigan in Chicago Illinois in
Philadelphia Pennsylvania
now 810 wealthiest counties in America
around Washington DC where you're
literally rewarded of how close you are
to the power center and for us to get
away from that I think there's there are
some solutions that I would actually
tend to agree with it would be very fair
map so on and so forth
but I think our generation is looking
for a series of policies and ideas that
will I think address in a not
necessarily that turn bipartisan because
it almost lends itself to that both
Republicans and Democrats are the answer
I would say the Pope in some way
it's bigger than partisan issues in some
ways and I look if you follow my what I
say closely I think that until the
Republican Party's honest with ourselves
with the failures of our own party over
the last 3040 years such as george w
bush was a big spending liberal that
betrayed all of our principles time and
time again we're not going to be able to
actually appropriate solutions that will
increase freedom and shrink government
and put the same government that's
bought by these corrupt lobbyists and
in Snyder's back to people yeah that's a
great point and Charlie on it now go
over to Kyle here because you made the
point about this widening gap between
you know Washington DC and the rest of
the country not only in terms of power
but also in terms of now income and I've
heard this divided America reframed
particularly after the 2016 election
it's not so much between the left versus
right it's really kinda halves in the
have-nots I know this is an issue that
you know you've talked about what can we
do to bridge that sort of divide well I
want to just take a step back real quick
and say I actually surprisingly agree
with a lot of what Charlie Couric said
and he made a point to bring up you know
the size of government and how perhaps
we have some large disagreements on that
well I actually want to reach out and
say maybe there are many areas where we
totally agree on the size of government
so when it comes to for example you know
warrantless NSA spying if you tell me
hey man listen I hate the government
I don't want an intervening life in my
life in that realm well I say you're
goddamn right and let's work together to
try to get rid of
[Applause]
oh good so I'm happy to do that and
there's other areas too like you know
the drug war for example that's giant
government and it really make those bars
to say like there's a lot of agreement
between what I would call the populist
left and the libertarian right so Rand
Paul for example is relatively
consistent in an anti-war stance and of
course if you're pro war you are
appropriate government by definition
because right so if you're anti-war are
means war - we can agree on that
wonderful or the horrible thing yes okay
so now we just both lose our careers
because we agreed on something we've got
that principle that man the only point
where I disagree is I don't think george
w bush was a liberal i think he was a
war monger and a neoconservative and
[Applause]
context to it Medicare Part D borrowing
a three dollar we're having this
wonderful kumbaya moment so I hate to
ruin it by
government ended cigarette work but but
he did he did grow the size of
government tremendously he created human
agencies departmental I'm security of
which you put more under a traditional
left-wing you know well it's what were
the priorities when he grew government
and when you spend seven trillion
dollars on the war in Iraq that's what
is projected to be by 2050 three that's
not a left-wing priority it was the left
who stands Bernie Sanders who voted
against all right I'm gonna bring Lauren
here so we were talking before this
panel about the incentives involved in
having an online TV show and I
personally struggle with the incentives
on social media generally including
YouTube because the most inflammatory
rhetoric gets the most views the most
retweets you know the most you know
followers and so I'm curious from your
perspective having you know run a very
successful online show how do you have a
constructive conversation when the
incentives seem to be pushing you in the
opposite direction why aren't we talking
more about the big issues here places
where genocide and starvation why don't
these fake news headlines getting so
much
and she gave the very same answers
that's what people are attracted to and
it doesn't matter whether we publish the
other stories or not it's not what's
getting shared and as an independent
creator you're you're very aware of that
fact you know we can spend weeks
researching a video about something like
political philosophy or the public
school system and it'll get a fraction
of the views that some you know rect
feminists ownage videos okay and it's
kind of frustrating but at the same time
I'm trying to look at it in a way that
at least people are getting involved to
these issues and you know my hope is if
they see something that's maybe a little
bit sensationalized and radicalize not
that I agree with doing anything
purposely provocative just to upset
people but you know maybe then they'll
stick around for a little bit of the
deeper conversation maybe then they'll
start to realize all right well why is
that happening and hopefully at the very
least it can lead to a deeper
conversation it's not going to be
everybody some some people just like me
I guess the outrage machine but there
are a lot of people who are going to
stick around maybe for the deeper
conversation right and Michael you have
an online show as well to see more about
the incentives that you've seen from
your experience well what I find is that
people reward authenticity audiences
reward authenticity you cannot pretend
to be something you're not
audiences are not going to turn up and
that's why I hate to break up our
kumbaya feelings here I love the
polarization I love it I love the
partisanship I spent a long time
researching in a book that I wrote
called reasons to vote for Democrats
quite thorough by the way I read the
I love it I'd want a choice not an echo
I don't want mealy-mouthed Mumbai I
don't want any of that I want to know
when I'm voting who I'm voting for in
the 1930s and 40s one of the major
complaints political scientists was that
the parties were indistinguishable
youths you have on issues anything
ranging from life to taxes to death to
whatever people having unclear points of
view now I know all of those issues on
the size of government on the role of
government socialism on life on marriage
on death on everything I know where the
parties stand I that that's the country
that I want to live it it gives me a
choice not an echo the conservative
movement was founded in this how do we
get along I have a simple answer we win
and you lose
and that might seem a little water that
might seem a little part but there is
much to quote Ronald Reagan st.
different there is no choice between
freedom and slavery these are not
morally equivalent when when one party
has elected leaders saying that we
should go to Republicans homes where
their children's sleep we should
physically mob around them though there
is not a moral equivalent to some harsh
rhetoric from a little old me on my
internship those are not the same thing
I'm glad that there is a difference now
and that's that is mine maybe that'll be
the sequel to my to my bestseller all
the reasons to all the reasons to vote
for Democrats part two we win you lose
so I wouldn't just pick up on that real
fast
okay it was just one second so hold you
I think in a democracy meeting choices
yes that's right
and no choice you might say well said
but I think the issue that we're trying
to pick up on here is not that having
diverse views is bad but a zero-sum
politics in which one side wins at the
expense of the other side and that's the
only way that we frame issues that one
side win and not at the expense of the
other side on the question of the life
we've been talking about Roe versus Wade
a lot because of their nomination of
Bret cabin on the question of life how
does one side win without the other side
Liz you're talking about protecting the
life of an unborn baby or snuffing out
the life of an unborn baby I don't see a
compromising I don't see a conciliation
on that issue I agree that the question
of life is probably simply shows that I
mean estimate they have smart to bridge
that no it's a [ __ ] talking point
because of the fact that what we're
doing is we're what we're doing is we're
finding the piper sensationalize metrics
by which to measure how we vote for
people but what we're talking about is
how do we improve individuals lives and
yes you're gonna have individuals like
like Tim Kaine for example who abides by
his belief who was very very much
pro-life who is a Democrat but he votes
in a manner that's reflective of his pro
life Tim Kaine is for election Tim I
support legal oh boy I guess but first
of all that's what I dislike summarily
that's literally what I just said I said
but you votes his constituency in
Virginia but what I'm trying to do is
move the conversation beyond this
conversation of life because that's
where we get bogged down well that's
actually tuple into actually four that's
actually
my point to you is that listen we can
talk about if we want to just sit here
and we want to have a discussion that
goes nowhere we can talk about what we
can talk about issues of life where we
probably will disagree we can talk about
issues of race where we probably will
disagree but let's actually talk about
something stuff in the tip that we can
bomb probably find common ground on
health care in this country how do you
make sure the kids I just want to say
that
so produ process which unfortunately as
a man so so visible and let's get
through let's just cut through a few
points give us life yeah there's no due
process here against keep up guys you
guys try your for do class sizes for
American citizens
[Applause]
all right guys I'm gonna step I'm here
I'm here the Sigma Convention
productions themselves I'm gonna step in
here it's gonna be easy if you walk
right into the trap like that so
[Applause]
apparently I didn't want to do or even
say no I'm enjoying the calm okay at
this moment I'm having my Charlie Curtin
okay so on and so on and go back to the
conciliation I'm gonna go back to the
car here because I think about you if
you want to jump in i we don't want a
man's playing everything and this
applies to most issues it is very easy
to see it as black and white but even
that's what i canta mean we have a
pro-life vs. pro-choice but doesn't even
fully encapsulate the range of political
views for as people you're certainly
right and there are some issues when it
comes to specifically abortion that we
can talk about we can talk about how do
we make sure that if people won't have a
adoption that that is easy and available
for them how do we make sure that people
are aware of different contraceptive
methods so we don't have the unplanned
pregnancies in the first place
[Applause]
I think that's a constructive way to
look at the situation and I mean
abortion if there ever was one
people would think it's black and white
so I'm gonna do this for this moment
let's go guys on cable news you said
when Kanye West enter the Oval Office is
what black people don't read few regrets
not what I said what did you say well
this actually if we want to go back and
not mean the take said this is what
happens when black people don't that's
not what I said what did you say
actually said that this is a discussion
in my major issue with Kanye West is
that he would tends to make anti
intellectualism cool and what I said is
yes this is what happens when black oh
that's not what I said I'll that's what
the transcript actually I said Charlie
be one you ask me questions while I says
he regret oh no I don't regret anything
Charlie so this is the point so I said
that's not what I said if you want to
know what I said I'm attempting to tell
you I said that I have a problem with
Kanye West because he attempts to make
anti intellectualism cool I say there
many people who want to talk about
criminal justice reform oh not seen
Kanye West to the White House to do that
I said Kanye West is what happens when
Negroes don't read you know what that is
that is in fact
you didn't say I said Kanye West is what
happened when Negroes don't read what
hello everyone and welcome to the what
now and liberals panel and now let's
meet the panel here our writer
consultant and TV political analysis
sherman singleton political commentator
and the host of YouTube's for NBC NBC
[Applause]
just as fascinated as you guys so to
start with Marcos I want to just go down
the line to get a response from everyone
so we've all been hearing about the idea
of a blue wave there's a blue wave
coming in November yet when you look at
history according to PolitiFact
according to Forbes the office the
president the party of the president I
should say typically loses around 32
seats there's only been twice with FDR
and George doing
actually gains so a lot of people would
wonder is there really a way or what we
expect to happen Movember is just
keeping in sync with historical
precedent I think you're confusing blue
wait what's the cow station there it's
going to be by all indications of the
waiting we've seen that in the product
selection in these election results if
you extrapolate democratic performance
before the general election through
special election imagine sort of
elections that would put about a hundred
and twenty Republican tell seats in play
now nobody's cleaning it or I may be
able to play but we are at a point where
you're looking at potential 50 60 seats
we have our fundraising the horizontal
symmetry kiss unbelievable double up
Republican fundraising in q3 we just got
the early vote members the first day in
the bottom last night and they literally
have doubled up from 2014 on that first
day they are almost at festival of odd
numbers
this is clerk in watch out Tony very
dumb why I was actually swing timing
could be typical me and Democrats are
out the Republican by clicking points
they never they were all in the case
it's gonna be this math awaiting the
fact that compass president absolutely
is attacking Hillary Clinton was
president right now we'd be facing
apocalypse as Democrats just by history
right of course
so
it's popular but it's also I think
registration there to be able to turn
Apple guaranteed zones and so for
someone like bado I think India within
three or four points of Ted Cruz is
actually a twin that sets up a very well
in the long term so not thinking that it
has to be all or nothing
[Music]
senator can accept or candidate from
Texas the people from Texas what kind of
energy has gone into changing the
electorate change go back building for
instructors so so Serleena
Democrats on the twenty four seats to be
able to take as this is tough the race
of the attack it significantly tight I
think that's why you see the president
travel all over the place really trying
to Jinnah Republican voters to turn on
even though they is along the battle
however there is a very interesting
dynamic that Republicans may lose the
house but gaining a seat or two in the
Senate
just and 2015 and so you know that's not
fun the Democrat to try to save seats in
the state of Missouri or Tennessee tried
to fit a C or save a seat in Florida but
I do think that this is a different I
just feel like this election is a little
bit different than all the other
elections we always say it's the most
important this is the one that feels
like that actually is the truth not just
because of the policies are impacting
communities of color of marginalized
people but also because of try to change
and now we know we have a time limit in
terms of when we can actually do
something don't change the makeup of at
least one branch of government in this
election we're going to head in the
wrong direction for you know the
foreseeable future and that is clean air
clean water so I just think there's
going to the state right now that this
election feels more important than all
the others and it's unfortunate that in
the Senate we have such red terrain to
to challenge and try to at least keep
the balance of power in the Senate you
know parent here and really try to keep
it somewhat difficult but you know the
truth the fact that matter is yes it
comfortable performance in the house I
don't want to certainly know that that
means you know the message the
Democratic Party as as a whole has a
problem it's just now in this cycle
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
because that's way to speak directly to
the people and when you do that it
actually works in the sense then you
know gets the news all day and he's
gonna make these cakes better than
anybody else
so as long as he keeps making his team
it's gonna be interesting to see what
happens because I don't know what's
gonna happen in these midterms I think
that Democrats probably will pick up
seats but not as much as everybody's
predicting
[Applause]
and I asked that question because no
member of 2016 no one is watching the
Republicans try to back justify their
range of Donald Trump see people who
despised
for now embracing people who say I don't
like the way he says it is a lunch break
that I love with the policies he's
giving us act right
and so you have a moment where
conservatives which I ideologically
opposed to but had enough HIPAA so
recent history of our country home to
span from values rights of synonymous
are abandoning morphing and showing how
in flux those values can be and by the
way an interesting wind when a
consistent ways right we saw the Trump
in the election was and and at the same
with there were concerns with some of
the things you're doing it's very
encouraged
behold by dr. Krim separated cameras
reporter it is in and in the scene on
what you're seeing as Democrats so let's
say we make it through midterms not what
any one of you guys just jump into this
question you make it through midterms
Democrats if you guys I would argue as a
Republican should not make the same
mistakes as publicans did by having 15
candidates run for office
what's the message for the Democratic
Party
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
- right now my cover at 22 we may have
more serious candidates a different
story but it's
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
there is something wrong
there is something wrong if we has the
ability of the
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
we have this is a moral issue
[Applause]
there are some differences I think the
audience believes and I happen to agree
with them that the best way
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
they recently changed that support we're
not very happy animos absolutely each
problem for the party it was a probably
2008 Hillary dragged out the primary
with Obama headed the mathematically
actual earn delegates and she hoped that
the super-delegates were gonna we're
gonna fail
Bell Rock same thing happen in 2016
there's some sort of poetic justice in
there I guess but after really it's a
super delegate firm it's stuck in the
race after two mathematically eliminated
because he thought the super-delegates
we're gonna bail
sir from the beginning it but the VDS
only fancy starts and he put in a super
delegate and excuse what the door
members were so I love the fact is
compromised they came up with which
basically says that they don't get a
vote in the first funded having an
organized party these are there ghosts
matters there are you
don't show up to vote the same way that
Republicans show up to go we got to get
it together
register turnout and show up you don't
have to load every single thing about
the candidates
you have to just show Republicans are
wonderful we vote for the candidate
[Music]
but the point is that I actually feel
really deeply about the marginalized
communities that are impacted by those
policies and so yes I will vote for
Bernie Sanders if that means the fact
the person is going to be trouble
because I actually care about the
marginalized people it's not just about
like supporting my guy it's actually
because I care about people's you
actually vote for yourself and let me
tell you that in this country the
biggest Democratic Party has not just
been and I agree I believe that the
Democrat Party because of its historic
elite big bang Wall Street big business
friendly politics has abandoned
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
appealing to women people of color white
supremacy of a sense that we are a less
legitimate party if that is how we which
by the way is racist it's [ __ ] so
that we also say I'm sorry but this is
not those see me working-class white
folks feel like y'all are even
condescended to that right just like
you're being any kind of sitting down
and that's not are nicer to humanity in
general and our policies and our
principle we are and you know what
conservatives can be really nice to
people in particular even though they
are in humanity in general so you know
what actually vote for your candidate
then you know what appeal to them it'll
just be mad at them that they don't see
the world the way you do actually
[Applause]
[Music]
Oh
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
middle-class white women are starting to
abandon the Republican Party as we talk
about how they're working the Democratic
Party to form their message is going to
in terms of beyond is there a room for
disenfranchised and just effective
actions of disaffected Republican voters
that you know what I cannot stick with
the Republican Party under trial is
there a room for those types of Horrors
in the Democratic Party going forward
Marcos might be Cohen you can shoot that
guy you know why would confess given if
you look at the polling is the single
rubycles demographic right now suburban
specifically and is that single women
are 60/40 Democratic married women about
forty five fifty five forty five
Republican and it doesn't matter if
you're never been married divorced or
widowed so when you get married a woman
becomes more conservative
if she it's a widowed or divorced she
reverse it because we're Democrat so
they are movable demographic they didn't
come through for the Democrats in 2016
when I look at that possibility of the
late
if these white can see that the quiet
suburban Republican women is they stick
with the polling anyway Democratic we're
seeing massive massive gains it's not
you see
water exactly that the biggest factors
are some concern so I hope that would
get them there's definitely room for
them I'm talking these aren't people who
they're not the racist from key in the
base
these are educated women who are strong
but if they were to beg the question in
this salad engine is a few moments ago
there are some things about the
Democratic message that I like but I
don't feel except I do feel that that
message is sort of me to people who
don't sort of follow this strip of what
it means to be a progressive or a
democratic socialist or that by and
large what you say to those people
I know actually I think it's about when
you look at the polls you find that a
lot of these issues we would typically
consider like far-left issues they're
actually very mainstream issues so
raising the minimum wage for example
eighty percent of the American people
want to raise the minimum wage and I
think that populism cuts across party
lines and it makes it so that you can
really build bridges
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
try to get them on our side policy and
argumentation to persuade them why do we
actually scientists that aren't you if
you would receive leaving less you
probably would not have would you think
about those
as to just bring those people back to
their side yeah in 2016 are 92 million
eligible voting eligible Americans who
did not turn out to vote I would
probably get about 65% of those are
Democratic into it's easy we have this
enormous pool of people that 35 percent
of Latinos are trauma over the Barca
story block the largest block with our
dock company van I was still surprised
because we've changed the back-right you
change them them and that's not
something that gives you just an
election day you have to have those
investments years out to be turning out
your base reaching your base but also
bringing me more people look without me
if I can mobilize your bases in
targeting mobilize new voters when every
single day the news is Trump Trump Trump
people say you know what I'm just sick
of politics you ignore the news the news
cycle is actually just the ecosystem
that we are all participants and and we
you know talk about whatever tweet
happen in the morning people are living
their lives day today people are dealing
with the issues day to day and they're
dealing with health care crises and
medical bills and you know poor
education and housing and so there are
issues that are in people's faces every
day when you wake up and that's what
this is about I mean fundamentally this
moment it's so hard for me because I
feel like politics has become a
spectacle and this is about policy and
people and I think that we've lost that
and we're at worst we're so into like a
bob lines and cheering and booing and
like
part of the team and having a color and
we're in Jersey and then I don't like is
you have to speak directly to them and
their needs and I feel like the way if
you let people know hey I'm not corrupt
and I'm against the establishment and
I'm for you that's the thing that really
motivates people and it really you again
you can cross ideological lines in that
sense and appeal to a very broad base of
people if they feel like you're speaking
directly to them and not to
[Applause]
have that binary choice of turnout the
voters vote for their alternative so
certainly nobody asked me this question
so I do Democrats however there have
been a lingering 40 for quite some time
that African Americans continue to go
over the wall only for the Democratic
Party and a lot of Americans believe
there are issues that are not fully
address criminal justice reform police
brutality
how can or what do Democrats need to do
to address those concerns so that after
burns can say toward not only am I going
to vote Democratic but I'm going to go
out and make sure those the validity
issues are systemic and you know
cultivated over decades and so you have
Democratic politicians you have for your
eight-year terms who don't have an
incentive to implement policies that
won't be an accident
you know for 10 to 12 years or changes
won't happen far beyond when they're out
of the pockets you see this in Chicago
Rahm Emanuel boy do not support anyway
have a lot of problems with because you
know there are problems that were is
basically caused by policy of the policy
tearing down the project's we knew gang
members within the same neighborhood so
you hear about violence in Chicago which
you don't necessarily know why it's the
way it is right now and so that that is
because the political choices made in
the short term and not removable long
term memory because those people don't
care about those communities those
people don't really care but the people
who live there they care about their
reelection and so I think in terms of
holding Democratic
absolutely true that you know democratic
colleges that need a lot of promise is
not necessarily deliver doctors on the
local level but all the way up you know
I have my issues I work with who I work
for
mm many but I do think that the bottom
line is that you know we have to get any
much you have to put skin in the game so
if you see the Democratic Party and you
see problems within the party get
involved with the party you infiltrate
and change from it and that's what I
believe and so you know I couldn't sit
back and you watch ordinary Clinton's
campaign and see that there were issues
are ways in which I could add value and
sit back and not do anything so I
decided to jump into the campaign and
then in either perspective talking about
criminal justice be the perspective
chalking of our reproductive justice in
the Hyde Amendment which actually did
push Britain to the left on the Hyde
Amendment specifically in the finer if
that's something that I care about a
wonderful color those women of color
camp don't have a portable access to
reproductive health health care in many
instances it's because of the vitamin
and that matters so I think that you
know in terms of what the Democratic
Party to do and how black people can
actually feel like they're they're being
listened to and her part of that is that
you have to get in it we can't just be
on the outside yelling or booing you
have to get involved and it have to be
as citizens it doesn't
you're gonna be the only one question
Kanye is talking about running for
Senate from California
[Applause]
[Music]
I read tsunami is coming if you guys
continue this

[Applause]
everybody introduce themselves let us
bury Margo's and just tell us who you
are why you're here and where you from
and then if you want one fun fact about
yourself
my name is Marcos malicious I am the
founder of d-glucose which is online
actually and I'm here because we have a
lot of work to dinner this whatever
you're interested so that's what hearing
 that cut myself I when I was in
high school in suburban Chicago I
[Applause]
[Music]
did Mark South Carolina where we have
three stoplights in a blinking light so
very nice to be here today I was in the
South Carolina State House of
Representatives for nearly a decade are
transferred to the governor in 2014 and
the reason I'm here with you guys today
is because I didn't like that race one
fun fact about myself is I went to law
school because they outside of the only
exam that doesn't have
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
alright let me just start by addressing
forgive upon the elephant in the room
this is a panel asking the question
should we be socialists there are no to
my knowledge socialists on this panel
and and I think I think to a certain
extent people up here are interested in
some socialistic policies about 7 degree
or another for the sake of this panel I
think the the idea of socialism is
different
and speak too but for the sake of this
panel socialism will meet the total
Democratic control of the means of
production small T not the Democratic
Party means control of production and I
should just say a lot of minds of my
point about socialism changing if you
look at the Socialist Party platform
from 1912 which listener sent me many of
the proposals that were proposed at that
time we now see already implemented in
the country a five-day workweek an
eight-hour workday no child labor
something to along the lines of Social
Security minimum wage
freedom of the press was already there
progressive income tax and so what I'd
like this panel to look at is to what
extent should we embrace socialistic
policies and to what extent as those of
us on the web as within the context of
electoral politics were you know a month
away less from 2018 midterms to what
extent should we embrace the labels of
socialism and the policies from an
electoral standpoint but where the
houses are like to do now starting
identities just give us a sense without
justifying it where you are on that
spectrum from the left to the idea of
total democratic control the means of
production which would be basically the
major industries controlled by workers
perhaps the student so just give us a
sense so that we get a sense of where
everybody is over the spectrum sure I I
don't know exactly where I fall on that
spectrum but what I do know is that I'm
a proponent of a mixed economy so I do
believe that there are certain programs
that should be socialized whereas other
things should be left to private
industry so just to give you a quick
example I want to yeah I think that
prisons of course education
[Music]
so for me having actually served and
been an elected official I find myself
someone who understands and believes
that government should play a role when
we're promoting equality and fairness
and justice right and just like you and
I think everyone on this panel there is
no role for a for-profit prison system
not absolutely none right but they're
there for example it coming from the
poor rules out there are there are rules
with private industry there are roles
for a banana tree to come in supplement
what government is not doing well for
example and our public school systems in
the south many times we don't have the
opportunities one of the things I voted
for which I'm very proud of was with
some people we call corporate welfare
but it was a 750 million dollar package
we probably could have spend it
elsewhere but to bring Boeing to South
Carolina why was that important because
in the South you can't improve your
schools unless you bring an industry but
you can't bring industry in unless you
improve your schools and so here we are
attempting to kind of find that balance
but government should play a role when
we're talking about equality when we
talk
justice so I would say I'm largely in
agreement with what Anna said and what
David said I my personal politics or
more social democratic than anything
else but at the same time I think that
what needs to happen in this country we
need to shift the over to the window and
wave back to the left because as of
right now that over to the window is
pretty full right we have Democratic
politicians like Joe Manchin for example
the time that's an actual number that's
you know they track everything when you
have a democratic politician voting with
Trump 61% of time and you've had the
so-called moderate Republicans who vote
the Republicans eighty nine percent of
the time it's a rigged game so even
though I personally don't believe in the
social ownership of all of the means of
production I think there's actually a
space for that in the conversation where
people can drag that over to you go back
to the left because I think the only
blame actually dead social democratic
reform is if you have actual socialists
in the conversation because you're going
to find that middle ground you're going
to find that you know that's the
compromise point and I want the
compromise point to be Medicare football
free college living wage ending the wars
[Applause]
that point is to have people who are to
the left
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Applause]
absolutely sure can opener I really
liked that point because I think that
the left can actually use that framing
in that language car advantage because
oftentimes people say about the left oh
you guys just believe in big government
when in reality it depends what the
question is it depends what the issue is
so I actually wanted much smaller
government when it comes to the NSA for
example who's doing the world of spying
on everybody
I won't much smaller government when it
comes to the drug war and the fact that
we have people locked up when they
really shouldn't be locked up so I think
it's very anybody comes to something
like abortion most people on the Left
would say I've got about three more out
than the way that some regulations so I
feel like we can take that frame name of
freedom that we could use to our
advantage and the left never does that
they deceived the ground to the right
and let Danny define you know what isn't
isn't freedom and they get to pretend
like they're the only ones freedom I'll
argue exactly the opposite all right so
let's start with you because I think to
a certain extent the you know from your
perspective someone has run for office
to what extent should there be
socialistic message like how much it's
certainly I mean you know
talking for 15 years at a time we're
coming out using the word liberal was
completely derided by the way people
would run with the word liberal on the
left because of their fear of being
labeled right now to the extent that
there's any hesitation it usually at
work is because concerns from the left
[Music]
so I actually think it's it's vastly
different because I think that
individuals have to run their own races
in their particular space like you have
to run your own races wherever you are
whether or not it's school board or your
local elected office you have to be able
to fit the community that you're running
in that that's part because in order to
get to the values and policy points that
we want you have to be elected
so I differ slightly because
[Music]
because for me for me it's a practical
reality that if I want to Supreme Court
justice I have to have 51 United States
senators Brett and for me to give you
one United States senators I have that I
have to be a party of not just Bernie
Sanders and a little Elizabeth Warren
but also have to be a party of doug
jones of joe Manchin right and for me
that's a very practical reality because
we just went through an entire because
of you give you if for example when joe
Manchin leaves the United States Senate
you're not going to have anyone there
who espouses your beliefs or my beliefs
or anyone believes close to I think to
win in West Virginia I think dimension
is a big point of that is that the
reason that we have a cabin on the
reason that we are we do not have a
justice Merrick garland is because we do
not have the majority of the United
States Senate because you come on like
if we fight will get machardie yes that
sounds amazing
I mean to sidetrack you but what would
be the primary data
[Applause]
[Music]
by 49 points there's now a Democrat
leading by five points and the reason is
I'm in a district under
[Music]
[Applause]
the strategies that these witness the
strategy is that litmus test right
though strategy the strategy is that
litmus test no way
and the reason that they suck is that
because then if you were to have a
litmus test you would not have a United
States Senator that's a Democrat from
Alabama correct you would not have you
would not have a you would not have a
Stacey Abrams you would not have a
engine feeling you would not have these
individuals for able to be progressive
for their particular state and manage
their own values if we want to have a
litmus test then we then you can have a
litmus test all you want however you
will not be able to effectuate the
change that we want to stay
[Music]
so I think that the important thing to
focus on is not left versus right but
more importantly the issues that both
sides seem to care a lot about and those
are the populist issues so let me do an
example when Donald Trump was running
one of the things that he said over and
over again was that he was going to
protect Medicare then we do not want to
cut Medicare now that we've passed these
insane tax cuts for the wealthy there's
talk about cutting Medicare admitted
we're gonna have to cut these very
popular programs politicians don't want
to do it because it's popular that is
not a right versus left district that is
a populist issue so I think the issue
that we're having with some of the more
moderate Democrats is not that they're
trying to cater to their constituents
[Applause]
because Joe mentioned within the
Democratic Party the Challenger was from
the left eye
Joe Manchin I think I would say is
anything possible in terms of like this
panel we could separate to the left we
have two separate I think it's important
for the links to the sickness
conversation ideology from
I agree I will go further than any of
this panel
[Applause]
[Music]
you walk out in the hallway you're
concerned way to the left that's fine I
mean you know politics is movements
waves but this is this is when we talk
about messaging just from pure messaging
when you make swipes based on ideology
someone like brocco bomb right
that is when there is a large population
in this country that then says that we
don't want to hear the rest of the
message right and so and I thought was
just to your point when you were talking
about the politics of Nancy Pelosi and
Barack Obama and that's the reason we
have down tonight
you know I understand what you're saying
but from a messaging perspective I mean
if you want to have issues with whatever
the policy is that's fine but it's very
hard for people to what's that once that
swipe is Levin is very hard for people
who want to listen to the rest of the
message
that's all I'm saying and just I'm not
sure there's a data point for that one I
don't believe there is just name so the
thing that I'm concerned about it is I
don't want to ultimately leave
defeatists for left-wing populist Falls
that are overwhelmingly popular I want
people to acknowledge and recognize that
a lot of these left ideas are actually
really popular and oftentimes we'll just
kind of run away from them and act like
well obviously the right is correct and
their framing and we need to pretend
like they're not for Medicare for all
because we don't want to lose an
election but the reality is we look at
the polling data seventy percent of the
American people are for Medicare for all
[Applause]
[Music]
it's not the Democratic Party it seems
now I would say this is the the the
average Democrat running for Congress I
think that's embraced at least nominally
medicare-for-all let's say joe Manchin
for example just to use his keep using
his example let's say you came out
tomorrow for Medicare for all and as you
guys know me he would consider it okay
so let's say he actually gives a hard
yes on it do you think that will help
them in what's going to do the politics
necessary for there to be a difference
between the difference between 50 and 49
is exponential when we're talking about
the policies that all of us up here are
advocating the difference between 50
United States senators and 40 million
United States senators is huge and so my
only point is that whatever politics
mobily joe Manchin has to do to come
back we need Joe Manchin right there
because we need that deep from West
Virginia
we want to move towards you know a
socialistic policy why focus on the joe
Manchin's as opposed to let's say the
chuck schumer's and i would be reliably
safe blue state should there be you know
and there's there's two things that
separate leaders which actually one is
the argument is do politics very with
all this money would seem in terms of
the past thirty Republican judges which
is skated through chuck Grassley
bulldozer the facile versus versus the
the question of like is he for somebody
with money makes of a blue stain
sufficiently to the left to pull that
over to the window or the center of the
dinner party to the left reliably
again
that's when we fight these battles the
general election once known as a
nomination so for instance you have to
keep in mind that one of the most
important one of the most important
factors in being a competitor in
politics is may recognition and media
attention and it's incredible the type
of block game that new candidates have
to deal with when it comes to the media
didn't word out about what you know what
they advocate for what they stand for
what they're running on so that was an
issue that
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
example a perfect example of this and I
think that citizens united is like one
of the worst things to ever happen into
the United States of America however we
were talking about good candidates
winning races being able to achieve that
level of media attention good candidates
being able to win in those primaries
when I say I'm not a fan of unilateral
disarmament I don't want to take away
resources from them right I want to make
sure that Bernie did it I heard somebody
that cover Bernie did it correct but we
can count on one hand or two hands how
many candidates have been able to
actually do that and so while we well
democracy we also here are advocating
for very similar positions on the left
and I think the only difference we have
on that we have on stages I want to
actually make sure that individual get
elected to implement that change and
it's not just the platform that people
are running on I want them to have the
resources necessary it's actually get to
the finish line and win because then
they can get them at the platform that
we're talking about by team ASE one in a
blue district with 25,000 votes right
and that is very important replicated
across the country but it's obviously
possible in certain areas for anything
they build upon if we build upon our
successes let me ask this
I got one fact I got a drop on everybody
first directly it directly relates to
this so there was a great honor on
intercept that came out last week there
are four Congress people right now who
don't take corporate equity after the
next election there's going to be over
40 saying we're not going to take your
BS anymore that's what's moving the
party and I think this shows that you
when you tell the people
I'm not disagreeing with that I am I am
saying though that if you are in a poor
rural area right now you're running to
give somebody who's been established and
been there for 20 years right and it's
taking money from advance American name
all the bad actors that you could
possibly make right from payday lending
to private prisons etc etc and you're in
this poor area yes
you tell your constituency then did you
tell them that you have these grassroots
activists that believe in it right and
people are giving you all they hat I'm
just telling you that there are certain
parts in this country where all they
have will still not be enough to we're
all set we're also living in a fairly
energized tongue and the Russ Feingold
and if there was ever a a poster senator
for not taking it was so so the idea is
it is definitely possible the fact that
40 members of the house theoretically
could be in Congress come November
January we're not taking that we see
money where you know it's going to state
Senate races as well as hopefully it's
both sustainable and not that's because
they don't report we don't know they
don't abort theoretically could become a
senator from Texas and not only be
concerned you know the issues not just
how he raised money to get that sleep
but how his opponent six years from now
how much money they're able and how much
money's going to be spent during that
time
you can talk to any senator right
Paul Ryan gave a speech last week and he
lied relentlessly about medicare-for-all
you know what as you sort of mentioned
it I'm more of a policy guy ideas are
what brought me into this line of work
I love taking an idea putting it on
paper going through the debate tweaking
it improving it adjusting it and then
seeing it come to fruition and most
important of all watching it actually
improve people's lives they are
proposing to abolish our health care
system as we know it
and it is in the best representation of
how far the Democratic Party has gone
off the rails in my opinion they now
call it Medicare for all because it
sounds good but in reality it actually
ends Medicare in its current form it
ends private insurance altogether
including for the roughly 180 million
people who count on health insurance
coverage through their employer everyone
no matter how much you like your plan
would have their plan take it away
instead you will be put into a
government-run plan where you have no
say in the cost or in the coverage
Obamacare meant fewer choices Medicare
for all means no choices no competition
how much do you get charged for this
that's a good question a nonpartisan
study found that a single-payer program
like this would cost the government a
whopping thirty two point six trillion
dollars over the next ten years just to
put the price tag of this idea in
perspective we could double all federal
taxes yours mine families businesses
everyone's taxes and still not be able
to pay for this the only way you could
control costs would be to ration care
and restrict access to doctors and
treatments all of these decisions would
be made in Washington of course so even
after the failures of Obamacare this is
the direction that the left wants to
take our country taxpayers paying more
to get less fewer choices if any choices
at all
poor quality of care all while having
the government control this huge part of
our lives such as personal intimate
thing for us a single-payer system is a
singularly bad idea
it all brings to mind what Margaret
Thatcher once said as she described the
problem with socialism eventually you
run out of other people's money and it
just shows how today's Democratic Party
has gone further left to the fringes
further back to discredited ideas the
fringes discredited ideas like you know
every other developed country on Earth
already has in place I was tweeting
about this yesterday because I really am
I'm impressed at how brazenly they'll I
listen
they act like at best Medicare for all
is this pie in the sky
unicorn fairy dust idea and they act
like at worst it's a dangerous hellscape
of a failed system when the reality is
it's not untested its tested and it's
not a dangerous hellscape it's actually
the opposite it kicks our ass and they
he talks as if like people in France and
the UK and Canada and Australia and
Norway and Denmark and Iceland the
Sweden can't like can't hear him because
when they hear this they laugh
hysterically
they think you're a dumbass Paul or
you're a liar both probably they think
you're both because you're just so wrong
everything you're saying is so wrong
problem with socialism is that you
eventually run out of other people's
money they think that's like witty and
that that's like a really good point
well people pay taxes every developed
country has taxes taxes go to fun
certain things in the United States we
have taxes taxes go to fund the roads
the bridges the cops the the fire
department the military you name it can
you look at any of those things and say
you know the problem with socialism and
taxes is that you eventually run out of
other people's money No
because it's grandfathered into the
system because you go well I mean come
on certain things the government is
gonna have certain functions just
question what are those priorities and
what should they be and most reasonable
people put health care in the same
category as like hey maybe we should
have roads but he's just such a [ __ ]
smear merchant all right let's go
through this I like how I put in that
first part for you because I find the
juxtaposition hilarious he started up
the speech by saying me you know
whatever bro not a big deal but like I'm
a policy guy I'm just like an ideas guy
I'm all about debating ideas and helping
people who are you dave rubin i'm all
about these ideas bro i got these ideas
i'm out i'm an ideas guy i want to have
the battle of ideas that's what I'm all
about ideas they always say that but
then they don't tell you what their
ideas are it's just like they like to
talk about talking about [ __ ] but they
don't actually just talk about the [ __ ]
it's just like I'm gonna ideas brah what
are the ideas to say the ideas free
speech and stuff bro yes I agree with
free speech also easy next moving
forward but see Paul Ryan's doing the
I'm a policy guy I'm all about ideas and
then what does he go on to do viciously
smear and strawman the other side when
they present an honest coherent idea so
he goes from that to I'm a policy guy
I'm an ideas guy I'm such a policy guy
that these Democrats are off the rails
for proposing Medicare for all what if
you're a policy guy and you're an ideas
guy you would immediately look at for
example the Commonwealth Fund study that
came out a few years ago which found
very clearly the United States is the
worst in the industrialized world in
terms of our healthcare we leave
millions of people 29 million people
without health insurance medical bills
are one of the top causes of bankruptcy
we paid about double what other
developed countries pay and we have
worse health outcomes
so mr. policy guy ideas guy didn't even
look at the [ __ ] Commonwealth Fund
study didn't look at the United Nations
World Health Organization ranking
policy guy I'm all about ideas bro ideas
like [ __ ] lying about
medicare-for-all and smearing the other
side he says with the Democrats are off
the rails for proposing it and then he
says it ends Medicare as we know it I am
[ __ ] stunned absolutely stunned that
the Republicans the the elected
Republican officials all got in a room
and they said all right what talking
points are we going with for Medicare
for all and they agreed to go with hmm
how about we say Medicare for all
is anti Medicare you're gonna say
Medicare for all is anti Medicare
Medicare for all let's say that ends
Medicare that's like saying I want to I
want to create a program Universal shoes
shoes for all and they say well why
don't we counter that by saying you guys
hate shoes but we said shoes for all so
you guys like hate shoes bro you're so
stupid
I'm not kidding how I'm in awe of how
stupid that is because guys you have to
understand that clear to rule full of
top Republican officials how about we
say that Medicare for all like ends
Medicare how about we say that shoes for
all like ends shoes and then he says
they want to end private insurance and
not true the [ __ ] Medicare for all
bill the Democrats proposed Bernie
Sanders bill specifically says this does
not ban private health insurance if you
want to get Supplemental private care
you can get it guys notice something
they don't have a real response so they
have to lie that's what's happening and
again Medicare for all is expanding
Medicare not ending Medicare
you know who really wants to end
Medicare you do Republicans and Paul
Ryan why do I say that because on a
regular basis you guys proposed
privatizing Medicare which is ending
Medicare oh my god they're so
disingenuous and then he goes on to say
no matter how much you like your plan
you lose it there are no choices he says
why don't you please go one layer deeper
Paul one layer deeper you fo
intellectual prick one layer deeper
there are no choices because everything
is already covered he leaves that part
out I never I never own even when I was
a [ __ ] kid and I first learned about
health care and health insurance I never
understood like what do you mean a
choice of a plan so like some plans are
gonna say hey man if you break your arm
will cover it and other plans are gonna
be like nah not on the arm breaking one
will leave that one off I never got it I
was like why would you have it just
struck me as absurd that's something
like health insurance and health care
that there would be like plans or
choices my idea
I think it's expressed very well in the
movie John Q I think it's called with
Denzel Washington where he's like sick
help sick help that's it
either sick you get help and you don't
go bankrupt and all have to pay out of
pocket
that's it sick help that's it but he's
like it get rid of choices by by
covering everything and actually
improving upon under in Bernie's bill
they even pay they even cover like
dental and eye care which is not in the
overwhelming majority of private health
insurance plans again liar liar liar
lyin Ryan that's all he's got and then
finally we get to again here's how you
know somebody's just lying if they if
they bother to talk about health care
and they tell you the price tag of
Medicare for all
without telling you
we currently spend there a liar
full-stop medicare-for-all would cost
thirty two point six trillion dollars so
that's designed to make you go oh thirty
two point six trillion well that sounds
like a lot you know what it would cost
if we didn't do Medicare for all
thirty-four point six trillion so the
real question is how can we afford not
to do it how can we afford to keep our
current shitty system where we pay
double what the rest of the developed
world pays and we leave twenty nine
million people uncovered and we have
medical bankruptcies as a top cause of
bankruptcy how can we afford to keep
doing what we're doing but he doesn't
say that he doesn't even tell you what
the current system would cost so think
about it they never tell you this that
yes your taxes would go up but you
wouldn't have a private premium anymore
so you would actually net save money and
even when Bernie Sanders made that point
CNN took it out of context and they just
played him saying your taxes will go up
they didn't play the rest of the
sentence but you'll no longer have a
private premium and you'll save money
they didn't say there because what is
with our current health care system
what's your insurer insurance payment
that you have to pay every month what is
that what is that private taxes you're
paying taxes to a private company have
to have health insurance have to have it
so you're paying a private tax so you're
you would you're paying more as a
private tax than you would if we had
Medicare for all where it comes out of
your taxes but you actually save money
so he's a liar he's not telling you the
truth and finally he brings up the
ration care point you know I've
responded to this point so many times
and it hurts me that other people have
not picked up on this and started using
it because it is vitally important when
they say medic Medicare for all we would
have to ration care into Medicare for
All system you say we already ration
care we have anywhere from thirty two
thousand to forty five thousand people
that die every year in the US because
they don't have access to basic care so
we already ration care and
a result of it up to 45,000 people die
every year because they don't have
access to basic care in this country the
way we ration care with our private
system is by how rich are you how much
money do you have
are you well-off because then you'll get
care pretty quickly are you not that
well-off middle-class sorry
you're not gonna get help that quickly
now are you whereas in single-payer
countries they go by okay who needs to
help the most that's what we're gonna
help immediately
imagine having to actually structure an
argument against that position the
position of okay in our healthcare
system whoever needs help the most gets
it the quickest imagine having to
actually argue against that position
like no I think that's a bad way to do
it excuse you please I'd love to hear
this what's your argument but see Paul
Ryan doesn't bother to do that because
he can't argue answers we just lies
that's the whole point of what he's
doing here so Paul Ryan just come back I
just want everybody to know that he's
not an intellectual
he's a phone intellectual he read Ayn
Rand we was a [ __ ] teenager and that
helped shaped his life and shape his
life and it it's amazing that this guy
has people dude like this really using
this guy's like intelligent it's I get
this feeling about many of the elected
Republican officials they're just as bad
as Trump
it's just that they pretend better you
know like Trump he has got the whole
unfiltered thing Paul Ryan's totally
filtered but you look at his voting
record and I haven't checked it out on
538 but they have the tracking you know
politicians in the age of Trump thing
my guess is Paul Ryan votes with Trump
over 90% of the time so the idea that
like oh he's intellectual but Trump's a
dumb ass as many in the mainstream would
have you believe silly
absolutely silly
so kanye west had an utterly bizarre
meeting with donald trump in the white
house
now i wanted to show you guys just like
a short
two-minute clip and then you know
discuss it and give you like the best
two minutes of their
roughly 20 minute meeting but when i was
prepping the show and i was checking
everything out and i was editing it down
the reality is i couldn't i couldn't
make that 20 minute clip
a two minute clip there was just too
much in there
that i wanted to share with you that i
have to share with you
so uh basically i chop this down as much
as humanly possible
and what i mean by that is i took out
like
if kanye or trump repeated themselves a
few times
on uh different issues i i chopped out
that and i chopped out things that
you know are are irrelevant but even
doing that
the 20-minute clip is down to i don't
know it's still over 10 minutes it's
still like 12 minutes or maybe even more
than that
but i feel like it's important to watch
every second of this
uh i know you have probably already seen
like little two-minute clips from this
entire um
discussion in the oval office but you
really got to see this whole thing
because goodness gracious is this
something
so without further ado here's kanye west
and donald trump in the oval office with
a bunch of reporters around them
chatting and i'm gonna have a lot to say
about this
really the reason why they imprisoned
him is because he started doing
positive for the community he started
showing that he actually had
power that he wasn't just one of a
monolithic voice but he could
wrap people around so there's theories
that there's infinite amounts of
universe and there's alternate universe
so it's very important for me to get
hoover out because in an alternate
universe i am him
and i have to go and get him free
because he was doing
positive inside of chicago just like how
i'm moving back to chicago and it's not
just about
you know getting on stage and being an
entertainer and having a monolithic
voice that's for
forced to be a specific party you know
people expect that if you're black you
have to be democrat
i have a i've i've have conversations
that basically
said that welfare is the reason why a
lot of black
so the peop lose the jobs and they say
we'll give you more money for having
more kids
in your home and then we got rid of the
mental health
institutes in the 80s and the 90s and
the prison rates
just shot up and now you have chiraq
what people call shot rack which is
actually
our murder rate is going down by 20
percent every uh just talked to the
superintendent
met with michael sacks that's ron rom's
uh right hand man
so uh i think it's the bravery
that helps you beat this game called
life you know they tried to scare me
to not wear this hat my own friends but
this hat
it gives me it gives me power in a way
you know
my dad and my mom separated
so i didn't have a lot of male energy in
my home
and also uh i'm married to a family that
um
you know not a lot of male energy going
on it's beautiful though
but there's times where you know it's
something about
you know i love hillary i love everyone
right
but the campaign i'm with her just
didn't make me feel as a guy
that didn't get to see my dad all the
time like a guy
that could play catch with his son it
was something about when i put this hat
on
it made me feel like superman you made a
superman that was that's my favorite
superhero
and you made a superman cape for me also
as a guy that looks up to you looks up
to raffler and looks up to
american industry guys non-political
no [ __ ] put the beep on it however
you want to do it five seconds delay and
just goes in
and gets it done right now you gave me
the heart to go to adidas because at
adidas
when i went in in 2015 we were a 14
billion dollar company
losing 2 billion a year now we have a 38
billion dollar
market cap it's called the yeezy effect
and i went to casper we had a meeting in
chicago
and i said you have to bring
manufacturing on shore
not even sure into the core it's not
about the borders the core of adidas
and chicago is the core of middle
america we have to make middle america
strong
so i had the balls because i had enough
balls to put on this hat
i mean this adidas thing made me a
billionaire and i could have lost 200
million dollars
walking away from that deal but even
with that i knew
it was more important for me to take the
chance of walking away from that deal
than to have no fathers in chicago with
no homes
and when we do have prison reformation
for no because it's
uh uh it's habilitation not
rehabilitation because we didn't have
the abilities in the first place
we never had anyone that taught us we
didn't teach us exactly we had no one to
tout us
right so um uh it's more important than
any specific deal any anything
that we bring jobs into america and that
we
provide a transition with mental health
and the american
education curriculum that a gym is
worked on
larry hoover also has a curriculum that
he's worked on we have montessori
curriculums that we worked on weworks
has a beautiful curriculum the waldolf
um establishment has a curriculum uh we
have meditation
there's a lot of things affecting our
mental health that makes us do crazy
things that puts us back into that trap
door called the 13th amendment
i did say abolish with the hat on
because why would you keep something
around that's a trapdoor
if you're building a floor the
constitution is the base of our of our
industry right of of our cu
of our country of our company would you
build a trapdoor that if you mess up and
you accidentally something happens you
fall
and you end up next to the unit bomber
you end up you got to remove
all that trapdoor out of the
relationship the four gentlemen that
wrote the 13th amendment
um and i think the way the universe
works it's perfect we don't have 13
floors do we
we need to talk to people uh i was
diagnosed with bipolar disorder
i was connected with a neuropsychology
that works with the athletes in the nba
and the nfl
and he he looked at my brain it's equal
on three parts i'm gonna go ahead
drop some bombs for you 98 percentile iq
test
i had a 75 percentile of all human
beings but it was counting
eight numbers backwards after his
repeating so i'm gonna work on that one
the other one's 98 tesla
freud you know so um
he said that i actually wasn't
bipolar i had sleep deprivation which
could cause dementia
10 to 20 years from now where i wouldn't
even remember my son's name
so all this power that i get and i'm
taking my son to the sox game and all
that
i wouldn't be able to remember his name
from a misdiagnosis
and what we need is we can empower the
pharmaceuticals
and and make more money that's one thing
i've never stepped into a situation
where i didn't make
people more money so we can empower
pharmaceuticals we can empower our
industries we can empower our factories
we can bring not only adidas on shore we
can bring
foxconn to set up a factory and i think
minnesota 53
000 wisconsin then wisconsin they have 4
000 jobs people making 53
000 a year and one of the things we got
to set
is ford to have the highest design the
dopest cars the most amazing i don't
really say dope i don't say negative
words and try to flip them we just say
positive lovely
divine universal words so the
flyest freshest most amazing car and
what we want to start with
is uh i i i brought up i brought a gift
with me right here
um this right here
is the iplane one
it's a hydrogen powered uh airplane
and this is what our president should be
flying in look at this jerk
work on this playing with but you know
what i don't like about
it's not that i don't like what i what i
need saturday night live to improve on
or what i need the liberals to improve
on is
if he don't look good we don't look good
this is our president he has to be the
freshest
the flyers the flyest planes the best
factories
and we have to make our core be
empowered we have to bring
jobs into america because our best
export
is entertainment ideas but when we make
everything in china and not in america
then we're cheating on our country and
we're putting people in positions
to have to do illegal things to end up
in a cheapest factory ever
the uh the prison system
i'll tell you what that was pretty
impressive
that was quite something that was quite
simple
[Music]
really very interesting please so you
you had said of
president bush that he doesn't care
about black people and you've heard some
people say that about this president
how do you respond to that what do you
make of that
i think we need to care about
all people and i believe that
when i went on to nbc i was very
emotional and i was programmed to think
from a
victimized mentality a welfare
mentality i think that with with blacks
and african americans
we really get caught up in the idea of
racism
over the idea of industry we say if
people don't have
land they settle for brands we want
uh polo sporting obama again we want a
brand
more than we want land because we
haven't known how it feels
to actually have our own land and have
ownership of our own blocks
so when you don't have ownership then
it's all about how something looks
it's about the patina it's not about the
soil it's not about the core
so we focus more on just somebody
wearing something to someone disrespect
me so i gotta i gotta shoot him
or the idea of someone being racist you
know we talk about
uh police uh uh murders which we
definitely have to
discuss and we have to uh bring nobility
to the to the police officers and make
them because police officers are just
like us
but this is this whole hate building
right and that's a major thing about
racial
tension and we also as black people we
have to take a responsibility for what
we're doing
we kill each other more than uh
police officers and that's not saying
that the police officer
is not a issue because they are in a
place a position of power
uh but sometimes their emplacement of
law enforcement they need to be law
power it's force
versus power when you have you shouldn't
have to force people to do that
so a lot of times the police officer is
sitting there they're being forced to do
this and forced to do that block and
then they force somebody into something
enforcing something we
have to release the love throughout the
entire
country and give opportunities a lot of
times
it's just the overall lack of
reparations
that we at any given point we say oh
this is racist this is racist this is
racist this is racist
so we don't have a reparation but we
have the 13th amendment we got to open
up
the whole conversation so and uh that's
a move one of the moves that i love that
liberals tried to do
the liberal will try to control a black
person through the concept of racism
because they know that we are very proud
emotional people
so when i said i like trump to like
someone that's liberal they'll say
oh but he's racist you think racism
could control me
oh that don't stop me that's an
invisible wall
but you don't think you're rejoicing you
have one question we're gonna go to
another question
okay i answered your question i don't
answer questions in simple
sound bites you you are tasting a fine
wine it has multiple notes to it
you better play 4d chess with me like
it's minority report
because it ain't that simple it's
complex mr president
i'm from chicago sometimes so i would
like to know what you would like to ask
president trump
to do for chicago you're here to talk
about crime in chicago
the thing that um that the head of the
police
and um mike sachs met with me last night
at the soho house about
was we feel that stop and frisk uh
does not help the relationships in the
city and everyone that knew i was coming
here
said ask about stop and frisk that's
that's
that's uh the number one thing that
we're uh having this conversation about
like
sometimes people say this kid has add
this kid has a cd he don't have add
school is boring it was boring it's not
as exciting as this
we have to make it more exciting we have
to mix curriculums you play basketball
while you're doing math you you learn
about music
while you meditate in the morning we
have to instate mental health
and art programs uh back into the uh
back to the city so those are uh and
also
larry hoover is an example of a man that
was turning his life around
as soon as he tried to turn his life
around they hit him with six life
sentences
so i believe he's wit you say don't tear
down the statues
larry hoover is a living statue what
about gun violence with all the debate
about second amendment going on
the problem is illegal guns illegal guns
is the problem
not not not legal guns we have the right
to bear arms
president trump said that he favors
stomp and frisk are you going to be
discussing that do you think he can
change
we're gonna discuss i didn't mean to put
you on blast like that bro but
it's definitely uh come here yeah
mr president would you like him to speak
at one of your rallies he can speak for
me anytime he wants
great he's a smart cookie smart he gets
it
trump is on his hero's journey right now
and
he might not have expected to have a
crazy [ __ ] like kanye west run
up
and uh support but best believe
we are going to make america great now
the thing is my another thing is black
people have an issue with the word
again and i believe my feeling from that
is because
i'm going to throw i'm go all the way
stigma with it because time is a myth
all we have is now all we have is today
so the word again this doesn't
hurt us because of the idea of racism
and slavery the
different things it it it hurts us
because we need to focus on who we are
now today i i believe so i actually
brought some hats in that have a bit of
a transition i'm not
that trying to put you up through your
spot a little bit i made a hat uh that
says make america great
just that but i would love to see at the
super bowl
trump wearing the make america great hat
colin making wearing the make of america
great and showing that
we can bend a bit on this side we can
bend a bit on this side
and we can learn how to be malleable in
the infinite universe that we are and
the loving beings that we are
that we don't have to stick to all
traditions and we aren't aside we are
one unit we are one country we are one
moment in history and time we might have
been here before but right now
we're here together in our greatest
value that people have are other people
and we need to stop working on red and
blue it's like a gang again
uh honestly from our standpoint this was
just set up to be a lunch
and two people that i like and i guess
they like me

and that's from the heart i didn't want

i keep thinking what if
i told you in the year i don't know pick
a year
2011 that in the future
there will be a president donald trump
the guy who was you know the celebrity
apprentice guy
ladies and gentlemen I believe we
finally have my finalized politican
schedule and I say that because now
everything is website official so that's
a very good indication that this is what
set in stone
obviously politican is very soon anyway
so you would expect for them to really
come up with the final decisions at some
point soon so let's go through it I want
everybody to know where I'll be
and what I'll be discussing and
hopefully you guys turnout and show up I
can't wait to meet you if you end up
coming to politican so it's gonna be on
Saturday and Sunday I will be there and
I will be participating on both days one
of the days as you're about to see is um
I have much more to do on one day than I
do the other day but that doesn't mean I
won't you know be around on the day
where my schedule is lighter because I
will probably be there so if you see me
come say hi we'll chat a little bit you
take some pictures if you want I say
that like I'm a zoo animal or something
oh come take a picture with the giraffes
but anyway so here's what we got on
Saturday I will be on this panel
it's called should we be socialists it's
from 3:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. this is
Pacific time and as you can see here the
panel has Sam cedar ana kasparian Bakari
sellers David Pakman and Marcos Meletis
this should be a fun and interesting
panel I'm actually very curious to see
what a lot of these people have to say
about this question should we be
socialists I believe you know there's
gonna be an overarching theme about what
direction the Democratic Party should be
moving in as most of you already know I
have very strong opinions on that so
we'll see and I'm sure there will be you
know some amount of disagreement on that
panel where we might end up getting in
some back-and-forth but either way it'll
be fun and I'm looking forward to
now this is the only thing I'm scheduled
to be in on Saturday okay so there's a
lot of other stuff happening oh and I
can also tell you it's going to be in
3:30 to 4:30 p.m. in Independence Hall
so the way that this works there's a lot
of stuff going on at once so um I mean
if I'm not mistaken there could be like
four different things going on at once
that you get to choose you know which
area you want to go in which room you
want to go in and which thing you want
to watch but I hope you guys turnout for
this again it's in Independence Hall
3:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. the first day of
politican on the Saturday and I think
this panel will be a lot of fun now
let's go to Sunday don't worry guys I'll
get to the debate shortly and you'll
know who I'm debating and I'll also give
you the background story as to what was
going on behind the scenes
okay so first and foremost actually this
is not my first panel of the day this
will be my second panel of the day but
in civic Hall from 1:30 p.m. to 2:30
p.m. there's a panel called how the [ __ ]
are we going to get along I think you
guys will be very interested in this one
because on this panel with me
there's Steven Ola Cara Bakari sellers
again Michael no Noel's roaming
millennial who some of you may know
because she's a youtuber right-leaning
youtuber but then you also have Charlie
Kirk so again this is the panel that
there was that we were told at one point
that it would probably be me and David
Pakman versus Charlie Kirk and Candice
Owens
it turns out Candice Owens will not be
on that panel but at least as of right
now charlie kirk will be on this panel
again it's called how the [ __ ] are we
going to get along 1:30 p.m. to 2:30
p.m. and civic call and that should be
interesting because I'm assuming there's
going to be some fireworks now this
isn't technically a debate it's a panel
but that doesn't mean it won't end
being a debate to one extent or another
and obviously you know I expect that
there will be significant disagreements
with the likes of roaming millennial and
Charlie Kirk so if you were looking
forward to a Kyle kolinsky david pakman
verse charlie kirk candice owens panel
that will not be happening but you get a
little bit of a substitute for that in
the sense that kyle kolinsky and charlie
Kirk will be on the same panel and just
for the record I know the panels called
how the [ __ ] are we going to get along
but I have a suspicion that many of the
people on the panel will have the answer
we're not going to get along and that's
fine so that should be interesting I'm
looking forward to that just so you know
there's a Ben Shapiro keynote speech
from 12:00 to 1:00 p.m. happening in
civic Hall if some of you if a lot of
you guys are there I'm sure that you
might check this out and then you just
get to hang out for another 30 minutes
and then you'll see that panel that
includes myself and Charlie Kirk so
again that should be that should be
interesting now there here's another
thing that's happening that day this is
earlier in the day
11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. in Independence
Hall there's a panel called what now
liberals and you can see the people
participating here this is the extra
power member I told you guys that since
Ann Coulter backed out I felt terrible
about that because I know a lot of you
guys wanted to see that specifically so
I said you have to ameliorate this in
some way and add me on an extra panel so
they did this is the extra panel that
they put me on it's called what now
liberals 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. on
Sunday and Independence Hall it's gonna
be sure Michael singleton Marcos Meletis
na era packs sorry if I'm mispronouncing
somebody's name Sally Kohn is or Leena
Maxwell again this strikes me is one of
those conversations that's like okay
what direction should the Democratic
Party go in which would be the dominant
policies and the dominant ideology
reflected on the left and obviously
again you guys know I have very strong
opinions on that and so that should be
an interesting conversation again
Independence Hall 11:30 a.m. to 12:30
p.m. now drum
please who will be the person I end up
debating the answer is nobody who's been
floated so far Scottie Nell Hughes is
the answer that's at 4:00 p.m. to 5:00
p.m. in the K Street lobby which is
funny
so Scottie Nell Hughes versus Kyl
kolinsky 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on
Sunday that should be very interesting
so ad I'm officially scheduled for one
panel on Saturday three on Sunday now
there may also be I may also end up
doing a Cameron Cass Keys podcast I'm
not sure I have to see what his schedule
is like and if he can squeeze me in or
not but I'm supposed to potentially do
that so if that's the case I'll have to
add that on Saturday so it might be two
things on Saturday three three things on
Sunday but either way you guys now know
the where these things are taking place
and the time that these are taking place
so who is Scottie Nell Hughes I'm sure
most of you already know Scottie Nell
Hughes because you're political junkies
but Scottie Nell Hughes ooh look at that
there she is with Donald Trump
she's a big-time Donald Trump defender
and she rose to prominence during the
2016 election see she was like I think
parodied on SNL here that's obviously
not her that's somebody pretending to be
her but she rose to prominence in the
2016 election here she is on CNN because
she was a very strong Donald Trump
defender and I believe a lot of the
segments she was in I feel like a lot of
them went viral because I had known
about her prior to her name being
floated again I'm sure many of you guys
knew know about her because your
political junkies but yeah she was
during the 2016 election she was one of
the strongest defenders of Donald Trump
so our debate will be about Donald Trump
and about you know his various policies
and how he's doing as president and here
she is at a previous politican now I
need to give Scott email Hughes honestly
a tremendous amount of credit and here's
why
when I tell you we ran through virtually
every single conservative going to look
at this oh boy Roger stone when I tell
you we ran through virtually every
single conservative at Politico I'm not
kidding
so I floated every name that all of you
guys wanted me to float you know hey I
hear you guys I hear you I see your
stuff on Twitter I see your stuff in the
comment section from time to time and I
I know what you want to see I know you
want to see Kyle kolinsky versus ben
shapiro honestly and i'm not joking
about this i think at this point kyle
kolinsky versus ben shapiro could
[ __ ] sell out Madison Square Garden
I'm not joking about that so I know
that's what you want to see so I floated
that I said hey what about ben shapiro
news came back
no he's passing okay now again I don't
want to jump to conclusions so I feel
like I always need to add this caveat
yes there is a chance that a lot of
these people know exactly who I am and
therefore they're like yeah kind of
don't want to get destroyed by a
youtuber so not gonna do it that's
possible but it is also possible that a
lot of the people who I floated
genuinely don't know who I am so they're
just like I don't want to debate
somebody who I feel like isn't nobody
you know and again even with ann coulter
who my understanding was she had agreed
to it and then backed out of it even
with her I genuinely don't know if she
came across my videos and was like whoa
not debating him because he seems like
he's gonna eat me alive um or if she
really just didn't know who the hell I
am and so she's like okay I'm in a pass
because I don't know who he is but
here's what I could tell you of all the
names that I floated you bet your ass at
least some of them at least maybe half
of them know who I am and they passed so
for example one of the names I floated
Tommy Lauren
Tommy Lauren passed okay now there are
names I floated that I'm not sure they
know who I am like I floated hey Adam
Carolla he's gonna be there I'll debate
him
or Chris Christie he's gonna be there
all debate him the three I mentioned who
were in the running recently Michael
Steele David Frum I thought I'll debate
them now again I don't know if they know
who I am and passed because they know
who I am or if they pass because they
just have no clue who I am but I know
that Jesse Lee Peterson who I also
floated relatively certain he knows who
I am and he passed so I floated all the
names that you guys wanted me to float
after Colter backed out I basically said
okay well I need somebody of relatively
equal stature to Coulter because I've
been promoting Colter and all you guys
want to see it I certainly want to do it
and I feel like it's only the right
thing to do
to get somebody of similar stature and
all of them past ben shapiro passed
tommy lauren passed i floated a
one-on-one with candice Owens and she
passed so anyway the point is guys I
give Scottie Nell Hughes a tremendous
amount of credit because honestly she
might be the only one who stepped up to
the plate I just need everybody to know
that I was asking for what you wanted me
to ask for and in the end honestly I
think the schedule works out very nicely
because like I said you get an awesome
panel on Saturday you get two awesome
panels on Sunday including one that has
me with Charlie Kirk on it at least as
of right now that's how it's scheduled
and then you get me versus Scottie Nell
Hughes on Sunday as well so it should be
fun I'm looking forward to it
by the way when I'm on this trip the day
after politican I will be doing both
hours of The Young Turks and then the
day after that on Tuesday I will be on
Joe Rogan's podcast at 1:00 p.m. Pacific
time oh and one more thing real quick
tickets they will be in the video
description box of this video if you
haven't picked up your tickets yet
please do so really want to see you guys
there I hope that the
entire place is packed with secular talk
listeners and we overwhelm them so the
tickets will be below TYT reached out to
me and they told me that hey if you want
you could have your people use the TYT
promo code and that'll save them some
money I don't know exactly how much it's
anywhere from like 10% to 25% but I was
like hell yeah I'll tell my people that
so for people who are looking for
tickets you could save a little bit if
you put in the promo code code tyt so
please do that tickets again right below
in the video description box and just
the very last thing I want to say real
quick I even floated two on ones I said
you could take any two conservatives
from this giant list that I gave you and
have both of them against me and I'll do
it when I heard that the response was
still no I said okay three on one I'll
do a three on one debate you could take
any three conservatives and put him up
against me the political people got a
kick out of that and they were laughing
and they were like okay that sounds good
I mean you're easy to work with and the
response was still no so you know for
all the people out there who actually
care about the hashtag battle of ideas
well just know that some people are
willing to have that battle of ideas and
other people even when they have a
tremendous advantage are still passing I
wonder what that says about their
ideology
so Donald Trump decided to write what
might literally be the single worst
op-ed of all time I don't think I'm
exaggerating it from beginning to end
it's just packed full of lies so he
wrote it in USA today and it's about
Medicare for all he wrote an op-ed
specifically on the issue of Medicare
for all
by the way shame on USA Today for
running that now some people might say
oh come on Kyle that's crazy he's the
president he couldn't you know he could
write not bad wherever the [ __ ] he wants
to write it but if your USA Today and
USA Today for the record is not known as
like a right wing outlet it's known as
almost like a very wishy-washy neutral
centrist outlet if you will your job in
the media is supposed to be to
fact-check those in power and to give
people news and information and what
they're doing here is abdicating that
responsibility and they're just letting
the President of the United States do
rank propaganda factually untrue
[ __ ] riddled throughout that article
and they just present it as if it's like
oh yeah this is one side of the debate
yeah but if you're doing your job you
would say hey here's the 17 different
areas where he's just flat-out incorrect
and to be fair like NPR for example did
an article where they fact checked
Trump's op-ed and they go no he's wrong
here here here and here and here's the
reality of the situation yeah that's
what the job of the media is supposed to
be you're not supposed to be a
stenographer to people in power and
that's what USA Today did they acted as
a stenographer to Donald Trump they just
wrote hey here here's what he says I
mean honestly it's it's comically dumb I
mean if you stop and think about this in
the context of imagine an official state
enemy of ours so you know take for
example the Grand Ayatollah in Iran if
he wanted to spread his propaganda and a
news outlet in Iran goes okay here just
just write whatever you want and we'll
show it to the people what would we say
about that we go oh so you're doing
state propaganda that's what that is
you're not doing your job in the media
you're not fat checking you're not
giving information you're not
trying to be objective you're just doing
propaganda for the government that's
what that is so if they do it that's
what we'd say when it sucks it's like
what do you know it's normal that's not
normal
that's not [ __ ] normal so if you run
it and check his ass that's one thing
but they ran and they're not checking
his ass and it's just I think how bad
the op-ed really is is leading to this
reaction for me because it is I mean
seriously
probably the worst I've ever read so
here's what he titled it Democrats
Medicare for all plan will demolish
promises to seniors that's already wrong
that they have this new talking point on
the far right and I'm amazed that this
is the point that they all sat around
and said okay we're we agree to do this
one yeah let's do that talking point
because at face value it's absurd
they're talking point is oh yeah if you
do Medicare for all then you're actually
hurting Medicare for seniors no Medicare
for all by definition is an expansion of
Medicare so that everybody else can get
the wonderful care that seniors get but
they they actively chose to go with the
talking point Medicare for all is bad
for Medicare you guys don't really
believe in Medicare we want Medicare for
all not only does that mean we like
Medicare we like it so much we want
everybody to have it yeah but that would
be bad for seniors how why are you
asking questions bro it's so bad okay so
here's what he says throughout the year
we have seen Democrats across the
country uniting around a new legislative
proposal that would end Medicare as we
know it it would expand it you jackass
and take away benefits that seniors have
paid for their entire lives
pause nobody's talking about taking away
benefits we're talking about expanding
Medicare so dishonest and
can USA Today went yeah go ahead you
could write this it's cool well no
problem whatever it is what it is you
want to lie brazenly to the American
people
fine go right ahead dishonestly called
Medicare for all the Democratic proposal
would establish a government-run
single-payer health care system that
eliminates all private and
employer-based health care plans and
would cost an astonishing thirty-two
point six trillion dollars during its
first ten years the idea that the
Democrats Medicare for all plan
abolishes eliminates he says all private
and employer-based health care plans
that's just not true
in fact in Bernie Sanders Medicare for
all bill one of the provisions is 100%
explicit and clear oh just so you know
this doesn't ban private insurance so if
you want to get your own private
insurance you go right ahead and do it
this has nothing to do we're
establishing a medicare-for-all system
if you want to get supplemental private
care free country by all means go right
ahead so when he says oh this is this
eliminates all private and
employer-based health care plans that is
just wrong it's not a question all it
took was just the tiniest amount of
research to go okay well that's just not
true the bill does not do that I mean
again shameless shameless lies and then
he said he says oh it would cost an
astonishing 32.6 trillion during its
first ten years listen to me
anybody who cites that without giving
you what the cost would be if we didn't
do Medicare for all he's lying to you I
need you to understand that it's not
like like oops sorry they just they just
kind of messed up and it slipped their
mind to give you that number the cost of
what it would be without Medicare for
all the cost if we just kept going the
exact same way we're going if they just
tell you the thirty six point thirty two
point six trillion number and I don't
give you the other information they're
lying to you and misleading on purpose
that's not conjecture that's the reality
of it so even according to a Koch
brothers funded study it would save
Medicare for all would
save two trillion dollars now my guess
is it would actually save more than two
trillion dollars but even according to a
Koch stunted fuddy is stunted funny nice
words funded study it would save two
trillion dollars so in other words if
thirty two point six trillion is the
cost of Medicare for all over ten years
it would be thirty four point six
trillion if we just kept going exactly
as is weird how he's not fear-mongering
over that weird how nobody says how can
we afford to continue doing a healthcare
exactly as we're doing it which by the
way that's the real concern how can we
afford it we paid at least double what
other developed countries pay and they
cover everybody and they have better
health outcomes so the real question is
how that how can we afford our
disastrous system that we have right now
well what does he do lies mislead you it
would cost thirty two point six trillion
hey Don what would it cost so we just
kept doing what we're doing now Shh new
phone who it is he says as a candidate I
promised that we would protect coverage
for patients with pre-existing
conditions and create new health care
insurance options that would lower
premiums I have kept that promise and we
are now seeing health insurance premiums
coming down alright I promised that we
would protect coverage for patients with
pre-existing conditions the Trump
administration right now is involved in
a lawsuit to eliminate the protections
for pre-existing conditions and it's
actually honestly it's worse than that
too because as his administration is in
court trying to slap down the
protections for pre-existing conditions
he's doing rallies all across the
country going I'm gonna protect your
pre-existing conditions
well then drop the [ __ ] lawsuit but
he's not doing that why because he has
he doesn't it doesn't bother him when he
lies it doesn't bother him at all he's
like yeah I'll just say this and we'll
do that he says oh we've created new
health care insurance options what are
you talking about under Trump you know
how many people lost their health
insurance in the first year as a direct
result of his executive orders that went
after Obamacare so he's basically you
know
shivved Obamacare in the side and and
acted like what what do you mean this is
what everybody wants raising this a
wonderful thing 8 million people have
lost health insurance under Trump's
first year in as president and when he
says oh we created new low-cost plans
Obamacare got rid of catastrophic
coverage because it was they were scams
so in other words they would say oh look
we a health insurance company we say oh
we offer really cheap insurance here
we're gonna charge you like 120 bucks or
a hundred fifty bucks a month and then
what would happen is if you read the
fine print of the plan you get no
coverage like they take money from you
and then they give you nothing and the
only time they pay out anything at all
and even if they pay out it's a tiny
percentage of what the cost would
actually be it's when you're like gonna
die
so the catastrophic insurance plans were
eliminated because it's a scam that's
what it is
so Trump comes along and goes oh well
let's allow the health insurance
companies to scam people and then what
happens he brags about it I've created a
new health care insurance options that
would lower premiums yeah cuz you're not
giving anybody coverage these notes
don't give coverage that's why they were
eliminated they were it was basically
fraud and he's bragging about bringing
back the plans that have fraud so
misleading this entire op-ed is
disgusting he says I also made a solemn
promise to our great seniors to protect
Medicare you do know that his tax bill
actually cut Medicare right he continues
that is why I am fighting so hard
against the Democrats plan that would
eviscerate Medicare Democrats have
already harm seniors by slashing
Medicare by more than eight hundred
billion dollars over ten years to pay
for Obama care
pause pay for Obama care [ __ ] you
talking about pay for Obama care
the majority of Obama care is the
individual mandate which makes it so the
people have to buy from private health
insurance so it cut the deficit the idea
that like oh it's cost so much I had to
pay for Obama care
again I don't think he understands the
most basic things about our health care
system he really doesn't okay more
likewise Democrats would gut Medicare
with their planned government takeover
of America
health care the Democrats plan threatens
America's seniors the Democrats plan
means that after a life of hard work and
sacrifice seniors would no longer be
able to depend on the benefits they were
promised by eliminating Medicare as a
program for seniors and outlawing the
ability of Americans to enroll in
private and employer based plans the
Democratic plan would inevitably lead to
massive rationing of health care and
wrong again so again we already
established it's just not true that all
this bans private health insurance the
Medicare for all bill specifically says
we are not banning private insurance
he's I don't care just lie better anyway
and the point on rationing this is the
point that you run into the most when
you talk about Medicare for all and
ironically it's one of the most
misleading points - but it's powered it
over and over and over and over
the reality is literally every country
on earth rations care it's just a matter
of how you decide to do it now in
single-payer countries what they do is
they do it based on care so whoever
needs care the most gets it immediately
that's the way it works so in other
words if you have an elective procedure
so in other words a seed you don't
necessarily need right away then yeah
you might have to wait a little bit you
want to know why because the the health
insurance the health care system is busy
helping people who need the care right
this second it's kind of an important
point don't you think now in the u.s. we
ration care based on size of your wallet
so don't get me wrong if you are you
know in the elite if you're in the top
1% if you're a [ __ ] Saudi prince oh
yeah you're gonna get health care in
America because we got the best for the
very top for everybody else it's the
worst in the developed world again not
an opinion a fact not an opinion
a fact our health care system for
regular people the worst in the
developed world this has been studied
over and over and every report comes to
the exact same conclusion so we do
ration care but we ration care based on
how rich are you other countries ration
care based on oh do you need do you need
help now then of course you're gonna get
it right now and then furthermore they
love to come up with these like
individual stories
there was a guy named Ted who lived in
the UK and he had a bad experience with
the NHS obviously single-payer health
care dum tell them to take their
anecdotes and shove them right up their
ass why there's a reason it's an
anecdote it actually doesn't tell the
whole story the reality is in the United
States of America
depending on the year anywhere between
30 2014 5 thousand people die every
single year because they don't have
access to basic health care between 30
2014 5 thousand Harvard study came to
that conclusion that's how many people
die because they don't have access to
basic health care you know what that
numbers in Canada zero
you know what that number is in
Australia zero you know what that number
is in France or the UK 0 0 Norway
Denmark Iceland Sweden zero zero zero
zero so you have to understand that in
order to say the things he's saying you
have to be working backwards from your
conclusion or you have to be just
massively corrupt because you're just
doing the bidding of the for-profit
health insurance companies so you're
like I don't care I'll just say whatever
that's the only way you can come to the
conclusions that he's coming to you know
and let's face it like I said a thousand
times ready this is just the whole thing
is alive from beginning to end
he's just lie lie lie lie lie one after
the other from Donald Trump all right
more doctors and hospitals would be put
out of business and wrong seniors would
lose access to their favorite doctors
and wrong there would be long wait lines
for appointments and procedures and
wrong previously covered care would be
effectively denied aren't wrong in
practice the Democratic Party's
so-called Medicare for all would really
be Medicare for none how non witty did
you come up with that yourself you
[ __ ] buffoon under the Democrats plan
today's Medicare would be forced to die
it would be forced to expand the
Democrats plan also would mean the end
of choice for seniors over their own
health care decisions and it wrong
instead Democrats would give total
and control over seniors healthcare
decisions to the bureaucrats in
Washington DC wrong and by the way you
guys are so concerned with death panels
or so you say you do know we have death
panels right the [ __ ] now right
they're called for-profit health
insurance companies and they can just
willy-nilly decide yeah we don't want to
cover your your surgery so either die or
go bankrupt by the way how many medical
bankruptcies are there in other
developed countries none how many are
there in the US it's one of the top it's
one of the leading causes of
bankruptcies neon states of america
medical bankruptcies that's a thing that
exists here doesn't exist there doesn't
exist in other developed countries
endless lies the first thing the
Democratic plan would do to end choice
for seniors is eliminate Medicare
Advantage plans for about 20 million
seniors as well as eliminate other
private health plans that seniors
currently use to supplement their
Medicare coverage all eyes next the
Democrats would eliminate every
American's private and employer-based
health plans notice how he's just
repeating the same lies over and over it
is right there in their proposed
legislation no it's not the opposite is
in the legislation Democrats outlaw
private health plans that offer the same
benefits as the government plan
Americans might think that such an
extreme anti senior anti choice and anti
consumer proposal for government-run
health care would find little support
among Democrats in Congress
unfortunately they would be wrong 123
Democrats in the House of
Representatives 64% of House Democrats
as well as 15 Democrats have already
formed a code and have already formally
co-sponsored this legislation Democratic
nominees for governor in Florida
California Maryland are all campaigning
in support of it as are many Democratic
congressional candidates yeah it should
be more and by the way if the Democrats
shy away from pushing Medicare for all
now as a result of this Trump op-ed they
are the dumbest people politically on
the planet because this is I mean he's
giving you a gift the gift is hey I'm
arguing against health care for
everybody that's cheaper and better and
my guess is especially among like Nancy
Pelosi Chuck Schumer's they already
don't support Medicare for all
all they're gonna behind-the-scenes
they're like you have to stop talking
about Medicare for all we're gonna get
clobbered by the Republicans or Chuck
you can I don't know what's that word
I'm looking for respond like you have
the ability to fight back and you have a
political winner here
100 percent 70 percent of the country
now supports Medicare 70% of the
country's ports Medicare for all did you
know even a majority of Republicans
support Medicare for all it is wildly
politically popular and that's only with
a handful of elected officials
Democratic politicians actually making
the case so Bernie Sanders is making the
case Rokon is making the case you know
Alexandria Ocasio Cortes who's not even
in Congress yet is making the case so
honestly stop and think about that
there's only a handful of people even
making the right points on Medicare for
all and it's already 70 percent popular
imagine if the entire Democratic Party
got on the same page and all push the
proper arguments and all said the things
that I tell you guys on a regular basis
like oh yeah would save two trillion
dollars and you cover everybody and we
cut our health care costs in half just
imagine for a second if every Democrat
was like you do know we're the only
developed country that doesn't have a
one version or another of a single-payer
system right you do understand that that
we ranked last in the developed world
you do get that right if every Democrat
make this point I swear the polls would
be like 95 percent in favor of Medicare
attempt numero dos yeah on the podcast
it's just we don't have good luck with
this [ __ ] no no we were talking for like
five minutes and then I randomly could
not hear a goddamn word corn was saying
and it was registering like you guys
probably could hear it but I couldn't
hear it so you how can you continue a
podcast when I can't hear you should be
able to write to Skype and [ __ ] get
like a free membership even though this
[ __ ] is free anyway I um I sent a note
to Chipotle because I had these this kid
in my office actually had to pass down
buy-one-get-one cards January from March
so he was like all there expired
whatever I was like oh give him to me so
I wrote to Chipotle and some lady hit me
back and she's gonna send me to two new
ones with like new or expiration dates
on them that's a lot you deserve
whatever the discount is that you got
you deserve it for doing that work
because that work I was mad nice to her
because um I was just like nice I was
like oh I go to this Chipotle I love you
guys bah blah I sent her a picture of
the two coupons and I circled the
expired date on them I was like let me
know if you want me to send them back
and she hit me back I was like yeah send
them back so I'm hoping because I was
nice that she looked me up with like
here 20 free [ __ ] burrito coupons
damn do they give out free burrito
coupons because that was the best thing
ever
yeah Molly once wrote to them because
the Chipotle we go to was they were out
of forks uh-huh
so she wrote them an old was like you
know how you guys had a Forks blah blah
and they sent her to free like bowl
burrito or quesadilla joint if you if
you got like a hundred of those that's
like literally a hundred separate meals
dude people do that I mean like it's
very underrated reaching out to a
company and they'll like they're gonna
take care of you because one they want
your business and to like if you do it
on Twitter like if you had a problem
with some [ __ ] and you tweeted it they
would [ __ ] give you everything
because the amount of file
good people with like six followers and
no picture like and write some [ __ ] like
yo Nike what the [ __ ] you like my shoes
a little too tight they're like hey man
please reach out to us via here send
back this and we'll send you some free
[ __ ] you know if someone with some juice
said something it's a rap like if you
really had a problem at Chipotle and
tweeted that [ __ ] it's over it's [ __ ]
over I was this close to doing that with
health insurance when my health
insurance company was [ __ ] me over oh
they don't give a [ __ ] because yeah
exactly because you know how much I hate
our healthcare system yeah and like they
had there was like a lapse in my
insurance like cuz they [ __ ] up mm-hmm
and because they didn't transfer over
from the the the new way to take the
money out of my account versus the old
way when I had updated it yeah and I
nearly pulled the telling the secular
talk audience like pester the [ __ ] like
tell this company that they [ __ ] up I
feel like that would be the only [ __ ]
that they'd be they would not give a
[ __ ] cuz its captive cuz its yeah
what am I Who am I gonna go - there's
like [ __ ] that for those companies you
know and they're all they all suck and
there's no there's no like face of that
company like whereas coca-cola is huge
but if you tweeted at them or did some
[ __ ] they'd still want to get in front
of it because there's a like there's a
face to coca-cola you know like there's
a identity that they want to uphold
Malik the amount for each thing like
health insurance is [ __ ] expensive
whereas with you know if if McDonald's
let's say yeah they could send me like
five free burgers and it's like wow like
how much does that cost to actually
produce yeah looking five dollars like
he's giving me free five dollars yeah I
bet against all for you because I went
to White Castle and I tweeted a photo
that you retweeted and they hit me up
like hey man send us your address or
some [ __ ] and we like we want to send
you a couple coupons I was like that's
what's up
they sent me there's only like two
burgers and a drink I was a little tight
that they didn't like bless me with more
I love how you got free White Castle out
of the show meanwhile it's like I want
free White Castle White Castle we'll
hook you up there
one of those brains that like they take
care of their people they know it's up
it's so funny cuz I've been doing these
like videos like the pet for the past
few shows I haven't had enough time to
eat anything before the show but like I
had to eat so I was starving before the
show so I ended up taking like one of
those microwavable burritos on air with
me in the first segment I would just
kind of eat in the burrito and I was
just telling people like I'm eating a
burrito right now so shits are back into
they are pretty good and I ended up
posting this segment and then I was
joking around and saying like I sold out
to big burrito along with big seltzer
and so now we got a list going Kyle's a
sellout too big Seltzer big burrito you
can only do things with like big in
front of it
well well that's the cuz like if you
sell out to you know big oil that's the
whole you know like it's like big
Seltzer big burrito another one was big
red cup cuz I was drinking water I was
out of seltzer so I was drinking water
out of a big red cup that looks like you
know the ones you used to play beer pong
with or some [ __ ] Red Solo cups yeah so
I was like sell out to hashtag big red
cup and then there was one more it was
hashtag big cracker because I was eating
saltine crackers one day on there and
then I was saying how big cracker sounds
like a rapper name yeah that would
probably be like a racist rapper with
like swastika tattoos on his face and
all that stuff it just took a dark turn
no I'm saying like big cracker wouldn't
be like like a nice like a nice white
guy boom private place oh you too what
did I send you the photo of the other
brand
Lucroy or whatever oh yeah you told me
that Lacroix has that poisoning rat it's
like insecticide or something was in it
not insects yeah it was something not
good well supposedly a lot of these
companies like it's not like it's not an
uncommon ingredient yeah it's like
sometimes yeah that's see that's the
thing sometimes those headlines are
misleading because it doesn't really
tell you the whole story like you read
on and you're like the thing used in
insecticide is lemon yeah like oh this
isn't a big deal I still don't want that
[ __ ] tied to my like shelter you know
like it still does yeah no I agree just
for you know my own [ __ ] dumb flake
knee-jerk reaction reasons but this
should because we're both drinking
polder and by the way I checked you were
right the company that actually hooked
me up back in the day was vintage it was
not polar yeah a [ __ ] so vintage cuz
that was a good look by them yeah so we
I don't even know why I [ __ ] this
polar I should be drinking vintage right
now yeah true people at vintage are
probably like what the far like you know
we blessed you that's okay I think the
last time we did the podcast I was
wearing a vintage shirt yeah so people
hopefully hashtag vintage is better it's
only smarter these [ __ ] companies to
like partner with like people you know
that like you know relate to their
audience and [ __ ] because like your
audience trust you you're not lying to
them so you really [ __ ] with vintage
seltzer all right well I my audience
don't [ __ ] with all Seltzer like ice
except the funny thing is the one I
haven't had is the one that everybody
says is the hot [ __ ] which is Lacroix
which is the one that you were like
don't know [ __ ] get it so it just
goes to show that you know your [ __ ]
flavorful right aren't they more
flavorful like they're they're more
flavorful the more expensive yeah I
don't when I drink seltzer I don't want
anything crazy flavorful I just want
like water with bubbles I could be like
the pitchman for seltzer like the Dos
Equis man like the world's most
interesting Seltzer drinker well not the
world's most interesting the world's
most boring the world's most vanilla
something something basic the world
needs basic there holds most basics out
sorry it's just me sitting there -
drinking seltzer like just doing that
regular [ __ ] yeah you see me like
brushing my teeth and just sipping cells
or taking a [ __ ] and sipping seltzer I
don't know what that's genius - like so
I reached out to Chipotle I'm gonna
[ __ ] but I tell me what they've given
you because if they give you something
like five that'd be crazy imagine they
give you five well I spent so much money
at Chipotle like it's only like it would
only be right that they hooked me up
with some [ __ ] by the way that's a good
move I think that's a good move and you
can I mean you could get what do you get
what's your go-to order because there's
ways to eat super healthy at Chipotle
well I get a bowl that's already
healthier than the burrito for sure yeah
I get white
and I get extra white rice I tell them
to just load that [ __ ] up like you think
it brown rice brown rice supposed to be
a little better than white rice but why
rice isn't bad yeah that's what they say
but like white rice is whatever it's not
gonna kill me you know no it's not gonna
kill you I get on black beans bangin
chicken sometimes I do like the chicken
steak combo bangin bangin you're like
you want double I'm like nah just to
mute the regular ship would be heavy on
the hand the only thing is you can't you
can't go nuts on the sauces though
that's the thing because that's where
the calories starts stacking up and
that's what hits the toilet bowl is the
sauces well yeah you said that what is
it the green sauce that [ __ ] green
[ __ ] yeah and you get it anyway well
like this time it'll be okay and then
like an hour and a half later you're
like it's probably a combo of like that
and the corn or something like that it's
got to be a combo with something you
think had well was last time you had an
order from Chipotle without without the
green yeah I think I've gotten it every
time damn really you like to do that
much I don't know I should stop getting
it I think it's just like without it
yeah it's so routine to just say like
boom boom boom boom boom boom boom for
me I [ __ ] with sour cream but then match
it adds a hell of a lot of calories so I
was like let me just not get it and it
still tasted pretty good yeah sour cream
is good
Chipotle in general is just off the
chains and that's why they should have a
punch card every spot should have a
frequent buyer card because it's like a
loyalty it's like hey man I've kid I'm
like I'm been here ten times yeah
I'm spending mad money here hook me up
one time like yeah yeah a lot of greedy
and [ __ ] up when they don't have a
punch card yeah because they're gonna
make money off you even if they give you
one free meal for every ten that you eat
I'm saying and it's sort of like if some
were to think like I'm thinking right
now I [ __ ] been there so much and
they're never once like yo this one's on
me it's like look you guys are mad
greedy it scares me how quickly I can
house one of their burritos like I could
eat a whole like cuz I know every time I
talk to somebody their reaction is
always like holy - Chipotle huh yeah
well those burritos can't finish that
and they say it like so matter-of-factly
like Oh obviously nobody can finish the
burrito I mean come on look how big it
is and every time I get a
you know I could easily finish it yeah
you know you got a good burrito when
they can't fold that [ __ ] you know yes
and no like I like that I can't eat more
[ __ ] that way but at the same time you
pause you can't get it all in your mouth
you don't fight the hype you got to go
step by step in this [ __ ] anyway it's a
process I'm a monster when I have that
when I had the fat ass burrito I pick it
up and just a yeah also do that with
burgers I've never been that type like
there's people there's people that dive
right into the burger but then there's
also people that just bite into their
burger you know what I'm saying like
there's like like when Guy Fieri eats a
burger on any of his like diner driving
Drive show big bite it's like one of
those like Monica's mouth like I don't
stretch my mouth out that much yeah I I
house like a house whatever the [ __ ] I
eat yeah see I can't do that big of a
bite because I don't want to get like
[ __ ] on my face I think that's my pro I
don't that I think that's my issue do I
get [ __ ] on my face when I eat the
burger you have to there's no like
there's no possible way to take that big
of a bite and not get some ketchup some
mayonnaise some like but it's all you
can get on you [ __ ] take it off right
away you grab a napkin and yeah but I
just feel like you still have a whole
rest of your meal or some bout afters
can't help it you have to open your
mouth that much like because some of
them are thick like thick there are
thick burgers out there that burrito the
right way to do it though without
getting [ __ ] I like how you eat that
burrito without opening your mouth wide
because that burrito from Chipotle is
there's no way to not know you do it in
sections that's why you start with like
the top right corner or something then
you work your way to the middle it's
like just like a nibble and slowly work
your way not a nibble but you could take
a big bite out of the right corner the
left corner but like you can't dive
right into the middle because then you
can but nobody can't Racing has anybody
in the history of Chipotle ever tried to
take a bite right out of that middle cuz
you can't like you have to start at the
corner that's a given but even when you
bite the corner I'm saying you have to
open your mouth really big that burritos
thick son
someone might bite right into the middle
because they might have a theory like oh
there's more juicy myth like you want
your first bite to be like Oh
yeah you know like you don't want to
bite sometimes you bite into the right
or left corner and you get all the like
the bread from the like burrito
yeah that's upsetting someone might want
to just chop right into the middle of
this [ __ ] and get like all the gushy
stuff you know yeah
damn I want you pull it when you stop
talking about Chipotle there's dirt
Strad like there's strategies to eat
like when I used to eat my Eggo waffles
I would chop the left corner I would
chop the right corner I would do the
middle and then you have like the whole
middle juice of like butter syrup that
is just like compiled into that middle
area of your egg oh and then you you
slice that into one bite and the rest of
the meal is not as good after that bite
but that middle so it takes 1 2 3
your fourth bite of eating an egg Oh
should be your best should be your best
bite damn when I eat Eggo waffles I'm a
savage first of all I eat them with your
hand yeah how'd you know that you've
seen me do it haven't I think I have
yeah I think you just picked it up just
like I was like you're like sometimes
all straight up put the butter and the
[ __ ] syrup right on it and still you
eat it with my hand and still magically
find a way to not get that on my hand
but eat the waffles that way I'm a
savage I'm a savage the way I eat is
ridiculous you would think like I weigh
right now I weigh 175 mmm the way I eat
people would think like you should be
230 yeah you know one said that's pretty
good I thought you'd be more than that I
think I'm not like 180 right now yeah we
were talking about this the last time
when we were in LA how you weighed more
than me and that was the first time in
the history of us knowing each other
were you had more than me yeah yeah I'm
gonna be on point now I know you were
just telling me before the podcast say
you're you oh I'm gonna go for a run
oh yes did you go for a run or no oh
yeah I went for a run sorry I was
watching the Yankees they're down
[ __ ] for nothing right now
you know what I had on before this I had
on I turned on the American Music Awards
because I hate myself
oh and all that [ __ ] two things I took
away from it number one John Stamos does
not age number 2 Jennifer Lopez doesn't
age
neither one she doesn't age but stayin
liked it gets ya he didn't age if it was
work done and [ __ ] make sure we get work
done but whoever the [ __ ] is surgeon is
he needs to pay him double what he's
paying him cuz [ __ ] he looks like he did
when he was on [ __ ] Full House in
1996 yeah but he's got a [ __ ] up belly
button you know about that [ __ ] right no
I'm gonna look it up now Bing John
Stamos belly button no are you serious
he's got like a weird looking belly
button John Stamos he's like Aging in
Reverse yeah but I just I hate when
people like I don't like Hollywood
people should not know he does have a
weird belly button it's like weird right
it's like saggy and [ __ ] no like
something's going on with it like what
the [ __ ] is going on here hopefully he
didn't have like some [ __ ] because that
would be [ __ ] up then we're [ __ ]
yeah I think he just has a [ __ ] up
belly button it almost looks like
there's a little the little head of a
dick above his belly button and it's
engulfed his belly buttons there's like
a little dick there's like a man with a
dick inside of him trying to push his
dick out of the belly button from inside
of him you know what's weird is just
like being born with some [ __ ] and have
like if you're born with an Audi it's
just you're I mean there's nothing wrong
with it but you're you just different
from what everyone even when a majority
of people have in a me you know I'm
gonna ask the world's dumbest question
now but I feel like I now Dee was only a
thing when we were kids like I feel like
there's no adults who still have outies
what they like eventually right back in
hell yeah that motherfucker's definitely
have outies I feel like when we when
when we were kids that was a thing like
all you have an inny or an outy
like that was a thing my god and then
now I feel like adults nobody's like
yeah I have an Audi you don't really
like you don't talk about that with talk
about that why were you talking about
that nobody's at work like hey Dave show
me your belly button
he's like 46 he's like I have kids I'm
sending some to college it's weird
that's weird how only a tiny percentage
of the population are lefties isn't that
weird that's it
tiny percentage yeah wouldn't you think
only like [ __ ] what you think it'd be
like 50/50 it should be more closer to
50 I'm saying and it's not let me let me
look this up percentage I'm like not as
big on the lefty thing because my mom's
a lefty my wife's a lefty my sister's a
lefty so I know 10% teats
that's it what that's what I'm saying
and you know how I knew there was a tiny
percentage gone huh because you look at
golf the overwhelming majority got
literally 90% of golfers are
right-handed so we were like if you're
Brett Kavanaugh is now officially
justice Brett Kavanaugh
he's been approved to sit on the Supreme
Court the final vote was 52 48
here are the interesting votes that
merit comment it almost goes without
saying that virtually every Republican
voted in favor of him
that's except Lisa Murkowski she was the
one who voted against him senator from
Alaska but Jeff Flake for example voted
for him now what did I tell you don't
fall for his shtick never fall for his
shtick he's a bullshitter his whole
thing is I'm the more reasonable
moderate centrist Republican so you guys
can all like me I'm not like big bad
Trump but as we've explained on this
show before I forget the exact number
but within a pointer to a flake votes
with Trump 86% of the time so that's an
act
he just has I have a different demeanor
than Donald Trump
I don't do mean tweets I pretend to
listen to people and be concerned about
them in their lives and then I end up
voting in a standard douchebag
Republican way so don't fall for his
shtick never fall for his shtick it's
nonsense
Susan Collins also gave a long
meandering 45-minute speech where and
where she ultimately announced I'm gonna
vote for Brett Kavanaugh so those are
the interesting ones on the Republican
side and how they voted every single
Democrat except Joe Manchin voted
against Brett Kavanaugh joe Manchin is
pathetic he thinks they're like oh maybe
if I support Brett Kavanaugh then I'll
get Mike Pence and Donald Trump off my
ass in this upcoming election
no you idiot they've been doing they've
been doing rallies against you Manchin
votes with Trump 61% of the time that's
an actual number 61% and Mike Pence and
Trump have gone to West Virginia to give
rallies against Joe
Inchon they're never gonna support you
which then you know leads to the
conclusion it's not only just a
political calculation on mansions part
maybe he actually agrees with Brett
Kavanaugh maybe he actually likes his
right-wing judicial philosophy now going
back to flake for a second I've warned
you guys not to fall for it and I also
warned the Democrats not to take this
strategy because what did the Democrats
do they only focused on the sexual
assault allegations now I'm of the
mindset that you can talk about that and
that can be part of your resistance so
to speak but it cannot be the only thing
you talk about because if you only talk
about sexual assault allegations then
what happens you're making it so that if
you give the Republicans a little
inkling of oh maybe it didn't happen or
you know whatever then you're allowing
them you're getting letting them off the
hook and saying well obviously we all
agree if he didn't do sexual assault or
attempted rape well then he should sit
on the court because he's uh he's
perfectly qualified and I warned them
from the beginning don't do that because
what's gonna happen they said oh all we
want is an FBI investigation and then if
we get our FBI investigation and it
clears him okay well what happened they
did a very limited one-week FBI
investigation Donald Trump limited the
number of people the FBI could talk to
further modern you think the FBI wanted
to know the truth or really wanted to
look into it so it lasted what four days
maybe the FBI investigation where they
didn't even talk to people who were
screaming at them and saying I have
stories of Brett Kavanaugh they're
really important come talk to me they
didn't talk to them
the FBI goes oh yeah nothing to see here
totally fine and then that allowed Jeff
Flake to come out and go see I told you
I was fair and reasonable I heard out
the FBI I said all I'd support an
investigation but now his name is
cleared so now obviously I'm gonna vote
in favor of them you dumb asses on the
Democratic side what the [ __ ] is wrong
with you I told you you have to
diversify your attacks against him
you can't only talk about the sexual
assault allegations you also need
talk about for example all the
Republicans say that you guys love small
government well guess what Brett
Kavanaugh ruled in favor of warrantless
unconstitutional illegal NSA spying you
say you like small government well Brett
Kavanaugh wants the government to spy on
everything and everybody so okay you're
in favor of Brett Kavanaugh why do you
despise the Fourth Amendment why do you
despise the Constitution of the United
States of America Brett Kavanaugh thinks
that Donald Trump might be able to
pardon himself that's that's insanity
that means that rule of law does not
apply and we have an emperor dictator
running the country because he can get
away with whatever he wants to get away
with at any time because he has the
ability pardoned himself so oh I didn't
know you supported the end of Western
civilization and the Enlightenment in
Magna Carta and the Constitution as we
know it these are some of the arguments
you could use against and the list goes
on and on guys I mean I've gone through
his wreck unlike unfortunately many on
the Left I have gone through his record
with a fine-tooth comb and there's
virtually nothing redeeming in his
record at all I mean this guy he sides
with corporations 87 percent of the time
they didn't bring that up once in their
resistance against him not once and so
what happens when the FBI goes or just
there's nothing to see here
then they're like oh [ __ ] I guess we
don't have anything to try to say in
order to fight back and the other thing
is they didn't even try to deal with
yuta mines the process Merrick garland
they even have a [ __ ] hearing for
over a year
this [ __ ] gets a hearing right away
perjures himself a zillion times and
then they just Jam them through and
nothing from the Democrats about you do
know that this process is totally
illegitimate right you do know that
according to your own standard you said
you can't even have a hearing on a
Supreme Court nominee in an election
year well guess what [ __ ] it's an
election year so what are you doing by
your own standard we can't even have
hearings on him hey he after you had
theories he just [ __ ] committed
perjury 13 times here's the list of how
we committed perjury I guess you guys
are in favor for having a liar on the
court I
guess that's what you're in favor of
you're in favor of rampant disgusting
brazen Liars who are pathological liars
and you want these people on the court I
thought you guys said that you know this
is a neutral objective non apolitical
court and we need to keep it that way
well this guy was out there rambling on
top of committing perjury he was blaming
the Clintons for the sexual assault
allegations against him he'd made
crystal clear I'm gonna be a hothead far
right-wing justice and you guys
supported him there were so many things
they could have said and by the way the
fact that Schumer couldn't even hold his
[ __ ] caucus and he couldn't chip away
at mansion to keep mansion on his side
that's beyond embarrassing Schumer
should have been able to keep mansion on
his side and he should have been able to
not only get Murkowski but also get
Collins and get flake and maybe chip
away at one or two others it is
unbelievable how badly the Democrats
failed here and don't worry I'll get to
the Republicans in just a little bit now
there's another person who we need to
talk about because he's a shameless
conman and an [ __ ] and a charlatan
and a grifter and him interjecting
himself into this made it so that the
Republicans had a better counter
argument than they would have had
otherwise I'm talking about Michael
avenatti Michael avenatti came forward
with some new allegations against
Kavanagh and it turns out that there
were gigantic holes in the story of his
client now Michael avenatti knew that
there were holes in the story of his
client he knew that that she wasn't the
most credible person but he came forward
with the allegations anyway why because
grifters gonna grift because he's a Fame
[ __ ] all he wants is that spotlight
that's all he cares about
so by any means necessary he's gonna get
his name out there even if it means
coming forward with allegations that
very well may be false that then
undercut the counter-attack against
Kavanagh because then Republicans get to
say are you kidding me look at these
allegations look at all the
inconsistencies look at all the holes in
the story I guess all of the allegations
are [ __ ]
because the allegations from her might
indeed be [ __ ]
so you [ __ ] jackass I warned you guys
man I warned you guys about this clown
ever you should have known he was gonna
[ __ ] [ __ ] up look you come out of
nowhere you're the attorney for stormy
Daniels and then now all of a sudden
you're on every single [ __ ] news show
and every single 24-hour cable news
network and in you know [ __ ] 25% of
the headlines I now see on a daily basis
when I scroll through my Twitter feed
among all the news sites are you [ __ ]
kidding me and shame on the mainstream
media for making Michael have an audio
thing how do you not see through this
clown and this fraud and now he very
well may have impacted it so that
Cavanaugh was able to get on the Supreme
Court congratulations Michael but you
did get your name in a few more
headlines now didn't you and then now
okay here here's the talk about the
Republicans I've seen many Republicans
celebrating this now of course the
politicians themselves are gonna
celebrate it they're gonna they're
tweeting you know pictures of them
drinking beer like I like beer - it's
great Cavanaugh got approved whether
there's John Cornyn or Cornyn or whoever
the [ __ ] else there's a bunch of them
and they think it's all fun and games
and it's all ha ha ha hee hee the thing
is they look like the insular frat boy
[ __ ] that they are but the main
point is not even I'm not even pointing
this at the elected Republicans because
honestly it's it so it's expected of
those horrendous elected Republicans am
I really gonna like Oh what chuck
grassley he's gonna [ __ ] randomly be
reasonable when he hasn't been for
[ __ ] decades never gonna happen okay
so I knew they were gonna be the
[ __ ] that they were or that they are
but the thing that got me man holy [ __ ]
is looking at the mega holes on Twitter
now listen I'm the guy who has always
said you can't paint them all with a
broad brush when it comes to Trump
supporters
yeah some of them are bigoted [ __ ]
like [ __ ] David Duke and Richard
Spencer and they like him because of his
bigotry
there but there's also there's a
plethora of reasons why one could have
supported Trump and many of the people
particularly in the Rust Belt were
people who liked his economic populism
hey I'm never gonna cut Medicare and
Social Security hey I want to keep your
jobs here no more outsourcing NAFTA was
terrible TPP is terrible I'm for the
working man this is some of the stuff
that Trump talked about the thing that
makes absolutely no sense and it's
embarrassingly so is that there were
people in the magic route who were part
of the you know working-class coalition
if you will the people who actually
support a Trump against his economic
populism the people who love drain the
swamp were now cheering for Brett
Kavanaugh to be on the Supreme Court
that makes absolutely no sense you've
been duped Brett Kavanaugh is the swamp
he was in the Bush administration
he's a pampered prep-school prick who's
always had a silver spoon in his mouth
he's a lawyer he lied non-stop even
about things like getting into college
you know his dad his granddaddy went to
Yale and then he got in as a result of
that he was a legacy and he said I made
it myself I never had any help this guy
is an establishment elitist insider
through and through he's the epitome of
the establishment not just in his
upbringing but also in ideology this is
a guy who thinks all of Obamacare is
unconstitutional this is a guy who says
the EPA does not have the ability to
regulate greenhouse gas emissions this
is a guy who through and through in
every imaginable way rules against the
will of the people and in favor of
corporate power and the oligarchy and
people who are part of the make America
great again drain the swamp crowd are
cheering this [ __ ] on so listen
here's my question for them which is it
do you agree with campaign Trump or do
you agree with governing Trump
because it's not you can't have both you
have to pick one do you agree with the
drain the swamp I'm an economic populist
rhetoric Trump or do you agree with the
I'm an establishment insider Trump who
picks other establishment insiders who
were Bush administration alumni picks
them to go to the Supreme Court you do
agree with that Trump because again you
can't have it both ways it's one or the
other either you support the economic
populism drain the swamp or you support
the swamp which is what which is who
Brett Kavanaugh is through and through
so you have to pick again it's not you
don't have the option of saying I
support both because both of them are
Donald Trump yeah but those are
fundamentally opposite so you have to
pick one or the other and that's the
thing is I don't here's the main point
guys they just don't care about all of
that the fundamental underpinnings of
their ideology it's this ready I'm gonna
boil it down for you trigger the lips
that's it that's all these clowns care
about trigger the lips just trigger the
lips whatever gets them mad I'm in favor
so it doesn't matter that I just
contradicted myself and then am a giant
hypocrite and then I make no sense and I
don't have a coherent philosophy or
ideology I just I just want to make you
upset on the left so here goes well
congratulations you got what you wanted
however there is a downside and there's
a side effectiveness your giant [ __ ]
idiot like I want to be kind you and I
want to try to interpret your actions in
the most positive light possible but
there is no other interpretation your
[ __ ] idiot is that simple again I'm
trying to be nice but you can't be is
what you gonna do you have to look at
the facts as they are and judge it
accordingly and the reality is you have
no ideology you have you're a vapid
vacuous empty vessel who's playing for a
team you're tribalist [ __ ] and you're
too dumb to realize it that you're
you're playing for the red team and your
whole philosophy is just I want to
trigger the other side well you did get
that accomplished so congratulations but
I I hate to inform you that you're also
just
giant dumbass and now you're you know
actively cheering on a far-right wing
super elitist ideology that's terrible
for workers terrible for the country and
honestly terrible for the world because
there are implications far beyond just
the US when you have a solid
conservative majority on the Supreme
Court I mean oh my god do you guys have
any idea how much damage is gonna be
done over the next 30 years now by this
court this Court is now solidly
conservative solidly conservative so now
anytime we get a win for the left say
for example we had a president Bernie
Sanders or a president Elizabeth Warren
and then we get a democratic
supermajority and then they somehow get
Medicare for all now all of that can
just be stonewalled by the court they
could here case on somebody's gonna sue
over it some right-wing group is going
to sue over Medicare for all it's gonna
go to the court and then they're gonna
come up with some [ __ ]
rationalization to say no this is
unconstitutional for reasons XYZ and
sorry we're striking down Medicare for
all this is what we have to deal with
now and listen guys the way that this
process unfolded with Kavanagh the
Supreme Court is has almost totally lost
legitimacy like that's it you're not the
whole charade of the hardcore
institutionalist of like American
institutions are about politics
NASA lacks know that that charade is
over with you can no longer pretend like
it's a neutral corridor it's an
objective corridor the institution
overrides politics no it's a ranked
partisan endeavor and that's dead and so
now you're at a point where I feel like
there's this sense in the country of I
don't even even if they rule something
now [ __ ] them because it's a it's a
ranked partisan organization of this
[ __ ] [ __ ] this prep school jock
prick [ __ ] is now on the court the the
perjuring liar a alleged attempted
rapist this guy's on the court and we
see how full of [ __ ] he is and we see
how elitist he is and we're gonna let
make decisions affect all of our lives
the court is losing legitimacy so that's
the state of affairs as it is right now
final point is people are saying the GOP
is energized maybe but I think the left
is gonna be more energized now I mean I
love this idea of like oh now we're
energized you guys got exactly what you
wanted congratulations you got this
douche bag on the court you got exactly
what you want we mean you're energized
you just want does that people usually
get energized after a crushing loss so I
think of anything it's more that the
left is going to be energized that may
have implications for the upcoming
midterms but I love how I've seen so
many things on Twitter of like
congratulations the way you treated
Cavanaugh has now energized the right
[ __ ] are you talking about the guy got
on the Supreme Court he's on the Supreme
Court what do you mean the way you
treated him is so unfair unfair The
Dude's on the [ __ ] court he got
exactly what he wanted you got exactly
what you wanted
Oh was his legacy her I Got News for you
the guy's a [ __ ] douche bag anyway I
said this a million times put aside the
sexual assault allegations for a second
he's still a prick he's a pampered prep
school prick anybody with a brain can
see through it so goddamn it man we'll
see what happens but I think this
energizes the left a lot more than the
right but now you have justice Brett
Kavanaugh the Supreme Court is lost and
there is no silver lining there is no
silver lining in this story and anybody
who tells you otherwise is wrong
so Bernie Sanders and ro Cana seriously
can't stop winning they're winning so
much it's making my head spin this story
is absolutely incredible and it brings a
smile to my face
I don't think Rokon is getting as much
credit as he deserves on this he
deserves a hell of a lot more credit
than he's gotten so far in mainstream
media in fact very few mainstream media
outlets have even mentioned ROH Khanna
proposing this in the house as Bernie
you know proposes in the Senate but
let's take a look here with Business
Insider says senator Bernie Sanders
recently introduced the stop Bezos Act a
bill targeting major corporations like
Amazon whose workers receive government
aid Amazon on Tuesday announced plans to
increase the minimum wage for its
workers to $15 an hour
Amazon's shift means the stop be so
sacked did what it was designed to do
even if it never becomes law okay so let
me explain how this is a giant win there
are caveats and I'm gonna get to the
caveats I'm gonna give you every aspect
of this every angle of this because I
think it's all important to share but
here's why this is a major win Roe
Khanna and Bernie Sanders got a
tremendous amount of [ __ ] over this bill
and they got [ __ ] from every direction
so of course you had the you know the
establishment minded folks politicians
journalists reporters economists they
scoffed at and they're like trying to
help backers how naive insane why would
you do such a thing and listen we don't
even need to get into the arguments made
by the establishment folks because as
usual they're incredibly hacky and
they're for the most part disingenuous
and they're just bad but this bill they
also got [ __ ] from the left
I know because a lot of people I follow
pointed out like this ain't it
and they wrote these articles about how
listen man here's the problem with the
way you crafted this bill is that it
stigmatizes people who are on the social
programs and you shouldn't want to
stigmatize them so it's portraying them
in a negative light and that's
unacceptable so you should have framed
this bill in a different way and
proposed it in a different way now when
I covered this I was one of the first
people to cover this piece of
legislation that Bernie and ro Cana
brought up and my commentary was the
exact opposite so what does this bill do
yeah let's run through that again for
those you who don't remember Amazon and
other giant mega corporations they game
the system so what they do is they pay
their workers poverty wages and then
what happens is those workers are then
forced to go use the social safety net
to go get welfare in order to make ends
meet if you don't get paid a living wage
at your job well in order to continue to
live you have to make up the difference
somehow in steps the government with all
of these social programs and then what
happens is it it ends up being the case
the taxpayers pay billions of dollars to
people who are working full-time jobs
for mega profitable corporations so what
this bill did is I said it was brilliant
because of the framing of it the framing
of it is truly bipartisan for left-wing
ends so the framing of it is well hello
Lefty's what we're doing here is we're
organic is we're trying to get people a
living wage it would tax Amazon 100% for
all of the money that their workers get
from social programs so you understand
that framing it's this [ __ ] you
shouldn't hose the taxpayers you should
just pay them a living wage so what
we're gonna do is tax you 100% for all
of the money that your workers end up
getting from social programs
the brilliance of that framing is I
think most left-wingers will go okay
well then the end result is getting
these people a living wage so great idea
but even the right-wingers you've now
cornered them with their own argument so
you now you say to the right-wingers
you're against this bill why do you love
big government why do you love welfare I
thought you wanted to shrink government
I thought you wanted small government
well we're giving you an opportunity to
get small government here this gets
those workers off of those social safety
net programs off the welfare programs
why wouldn't you want that I thought you
were against welfare I guess you're for
welfare so that's the brilliance of the
framing most on the left oh go oh that
makes sense you're getting these people
living wage and then most people on the
right will go makes sense you're
shrinking government you're saying hey
amazon can no longer leech off the
system and force their workers to get
get help from the social safety net that
was the brilliance of the framing but
again so he got they got Bernie and ro
got [ __ ] from even the left who were
saying no no no the way you frame this
is all wrong because you're stigmatizing
people on the social safety net there's
nothing wrong with using the social
safety net in order to win political
victories sometimes your framing has to
be such that you maintain your base and
you also chip away and get support from
the other side that doesn't mean you
compromise your core values your core
values I I'm probably the most
uncompromising voice when it comes to
you know my policy priorities but I
understand how important it is to frame
an issue where you're not just preaching
to the choir you want to sit around all
day and get nothing [ __ ] accomplished
and talk about how great of people you
are and how great your ideas are while
not actually getting people to agree
with those ideas have fun that's like
[ __ ] masturbation it's like all right
yeah we're great aren't we great oh yeah
we're great everybody else disagrees but
aren't we great here we're great the
brilliance of this frame
was it forces the hand of people on the
right to go mmm it does shrink
government I guess that's a good idea um
so what happened well listen my my guess
is Jeff Bezos looked at this bill was
called to stop be so sacked for [ __ ]
sake which is again awesome framing cuz
it's directly calling him out and
getting his attention so Jeff Bezos my
guess is he read through the bill or
looked over you know the the big parts
of the bill and I think he was scared I
think he was scared that this piece of
legislation was going to gain momentum
and before he was forced to do the right
thing with the law what ended up
happening was he was ashamed to do the
right thing because the media actually
picked up this bill to their credit and
wrote about it and like I said it got
they got a lot of people who were
arguing against it from an establishment
perspective and from the left-wing base
perspective but it got enough coverage
where it got B's OSes attention he
looked it over and my guess is that he
really thought this thing is going to
gain traction and it's gonna gain
traction because of the framing of it
because you can get Republican votes and
you're gonna have Democratic support as
well now reality is Beezus was wrong the
bill was going nowhere because listen
when you propose positive things
unfortunately most of them are dead on
arrival
especially in this government that we
have now but again the fact that it got
massive media attention the fact that it
was framed in a way that it could give
somebody the impression it might go
somewhere it shamed Jeff Bezos into
doing the right thing that's what
happened he got shamed into doing the
right thing it worked and then the point
is listen this may have been the whole
idea behind it in the first place if you
talk to ROH Khanna if you talk to Bernie
Sanders in an honest moment they might
tell you I don't know this for sure but
my guess is this is true they'll tell
you yeah that was pretty much all we
were trying to do
was like shame him into doing the right
thing cuz we knew was gonna patch got a
[ __ ] Republican Congress got Donald
Trump as president what are you talking
about
of course we're not gonna get this
[ __ ] pass you kidding me but it
shamed him to do the right thing which
is awesome and guys you know how many
people this affects I'm not kidding
about this 350,000 people 350 I saw a
video of when this was announced to
Amazon workers at one of their factories
they all started cheering they all
started cheering and they were so happy
I'm tearing up now too
this is such a positive step man I mean
ROH Khanna and Bernie Sanders should
seriously number one pat themselves on
the back and number two brag about this
at every opportunity possible because
they just materially improve the lives
of 350,000 people okay it doesn't get
any better than that
it really doesn't I mean that is that's
impressive now a hundred thousand of
those people I think are part-time like
seasonal workers but 250,000 are the
Amazon workers and I this also applies
to Whole Foods now - because Whole Foods
Amazon I think bought Whole Foods so now
it applies to them too so now they have
a living wage and I that's awesome now
while oh that's great and again a giant
step in the right direction we do need
to keep this in mind know take a look
there are 170 thousand fewer retail jobs
in 2017 and seventy five thousand more
Amazon robots so some people are arguing
that hey man I'm skeptical of everything
that happened here because Bezos is
going to move towards automation anyway
so this is like window dressing to try
to make himself look like a good person
well yes and no I mean the reality is
not only be Zoe's but the entire economy
is moving towards automation regardless
of what happens with wages I mean that's
just a fact of reality so if it's gonna
happen no matter what
it would be better and it is better as a
matter of principle
to pay people a living wage in the mean
time now this does show that you do need
obviously other ways to address what's
happening in our economy when it comes
to the proper policies but I'm gonna get
to that in a second but it is important
I wanted to share with you that yes we
are not just B's O's but the entire
economy is moving towards automation so
we're gonna have other you know
roadblocks ahead that we're gonna have
to deal with but then there's also this
from Axios here's what they say some of
Amazon some Amazon employees may make
less money despite the company's
decision to raise its u.s. minimum wage
to $15 an hour Yahoo Finance reports the
details although Amazon employees may
make more per hour warehouse workers
told Yahoo Finance that the company is
removing perks and incentives such as
stock such as stock and bonus options
which will result in some employees
ultimately losing money so okay now
here's the solution to all of these
caveats that I just gave you to the good
news that we have this is why you need
$15 an hour living wage and a union
remember that's what fight 4:15 is
asking for $15 an hour and the Union not
just living wage living wage and a union
so you need $15 an hour a union and to
deal with the coming crisis of
automation universal basic income you
know I was I was so so and universal
basic income for a while but I've been
flipped and I've been flipped because
number one before I wasn't convinced it
was economically feasible now I am
convinced it's economically feasible and
also the way to view it is just honestly
a Social Security check for everybody is
what it is like you know how we have
Medicare for all if if you framed
universal basic income as Social
Security for all well then again you
everybody would be for it it's the same
the brilliance that happen with the
framing of Medicare for all was when you
called it single-payer it was like 50
percent favorability rating but when you
call it medicare for all now it's 70
percent favorability rating
so when you call universal basic income
universal basic income I think a lot of
people go hmm I don't know if that's
workable but if you just call it social
security for all I think people will go
hmm that probably is workable and I like
Social Security so I think that because
of automation you're gonna have to move
to universal basic income system at some
point and I do think it's economically
feasible and you also need a union along
with the $15 an hour because if you
don't have a union that's when you get
these tricky moves from B's O's now
again I don't want to be too don't be
too cynical don't let your skepticism
scepticism is a good thing I support
skepticism hundred percent but don't let
your skepticism become cynicism by
saying hey because of the two downsides
of what happened here it wasn't a step
in the right direction there's a reason
why the Axios article kept writing some
Amazon employees may make less money
despite the company's decision to raise
to $15 an hour the reality is the
overwhelming majority of them are going
to make more money and now nobody is
going to be making less than a living
wage so if you look at it in totality
it's definitely a step in the right
direction I think the math will prove
that out that more people are making
more money everybody's now making a
living wage that's positive even though
it's screwed up that they took away some
of the incentives and they remove some
of the perks but again the answer the
solution that part is $15 and a union if
you had a union you wouldn't lose those
perks so they're they're always as a
catch because you're dealing with a
corporation here and there a moral
machines but I don't think the cash
outweighs the net benefit where the $50
an hour again if you think this is not
net a good thing go talk to those
workers who were cheering in the [ __ ]
you know warehouse when they learned
what was happening this is
unquestionably a step in the right
direction and don't let these articles
because I feel like what these articles
are they're trying to co-opt left wing
populism against itself that's what I
think that is when they say when they're
like oh maybe some people are gonna make
us well maybe this isn't a good idea I
think it's a way to try to attempt
left-wing populist to go
yeah maybe $15 an hour isn't a good
thing and it's like now they're tricking
you that's what that is that's corporate
media going how could we flip this back
on them somehow so you have to be aware
of all that but again the solution
living wage plus a union plus universal
basic income and then you have all your
bases you know taking care of here but
this is definitely a giant step in the
right direction
Rokon a-- bernie sanders brag about this
every single opportunity you get and
then now the fight goes on and also by
the way now you do have an ally in terms
of trying to pressure other corporations
to do $15 an hour as well because vsauce
is not gonna want to have a competitive
disadvantage so he's gonna he's gonna
you now use this as something to brag
about and to shame others about like
what do you mean I pay $15 an hour
well I can't this other company do it
well I can't that other company do it so
I think overall this is definitely a
step in the right direction but you have
to add a union you have to add universal
basic income or social security for all
and we're getting there man we're
getting there but this is how you win
and by the way credit not just to row
Cana and Bernie Sanders who deserve a
tremendous amount of the credit but
credit to the fight for 15 people credit
to all the working people who are
organizing and fighting back and really
raising hell about issues like this it's
the fact that you're uncompromising that
allows you to win if you don't ask for
everything you don't get anything you
have to ask for everything to get
anything okay you have to remember that
and that's why the establishment
Democrats the corporate Democrats are
100% wrong in their strategy of
concede upfront compromise up front
because then you're starting with the
middle position and then when you cave
you're caving to a right wing position
it's all the hard work of all the people
who are organizing in favor of a living
wage and a union and universal basic
income and all these different ideas
it's the uncompromising nature of these
people the uncompromising nature of the
stop Bezos Act which directly target
a billionaire and said you're the
[ __ ] problem it is shooting for the
stars that allows you to reach the moon
that's what we're seeing here so keep
fighting keep fighting because there's
always gonna be there's always gonna be
a pull and push in these situations it's
then Jeff Bezos is certainly not gonna
always do the right thing by the way
also Jeff pay your [ __ ] taxes [ __ ]
you know oh I did a good thing on paying
people photography and pay your [ __ ]
taxes while you're at it cuz you're
screwing the taxpayers and robbing from
the American people by not doing that so
giant step in the right direction I'm
incredibly happy about it but let's keep
going let's get a union as well and
let's get Social Security for all
Donald Trump reached a deal with Canada
and Mexico for the new NAFTA so they're
changing the name because you know Trump
if there's anything that he's somewhat
good at its marketing it's okay we know
NAFTA is tainted people don't like NAFTA
it really helped in destroying the
working class in this country so they're
rebranding it and now they're calling it
the United States Mexico Canada
agreement it's the same thing as NAFTA
North American Free Trade Agreement
versus the United States and Mexico
Canada agreement or it's called u.s. MCA
[Music]
which kind of reminds me a little bit of
the YMCA but u.s. MCA is what they're
calling it so let's break it down what
do I think of the deal well I'll lay it
out for you in detail here but it's
basically NAFTA with two what I'd call
mediocre changes one positive change and
then two terrible changes that actually
steal from provisions of the TPP what
happened I thought you were against TPP
no it turns out that those powerful
corporate and billionaire forces behind
the scene got President Trump to do his
bidding and that's not surprising
because does the exact same thing happen
with his tax cut wall street's wet dream
corporate america's wet dream Donald
Trump's tax cut for the rich 83 percent
of the benefits go to the top one
percent so as he pretends like all me no
I'm for the working man the forgotten
man and woman will never be forgotten
again they're Jack you're full of [ __ ]
you're just full of [ __ ] so let's take a
look here country of origin rules here
the biggest changes country of origin
rules automobiles must have 75 percent
of their components manufactured in
Mexico the US or Canada to qualify for
zero tariffs up from sixty two point
five percent under NAFTA this is one
that I file under
a mediocre change because listen if you
if you really wanted to reinvigorate
bring back American manufacturing you
would have to be more aggressive in
bringing back American manufacturing
when I look at a a change like this to
me this strikes me as it's just like a
minor tweak to NAFTA and it doesn't
really get at the heart of what Trump
claimed he was gonna do which is to
bring back American manufacturing in in
a strong way so I just file this one
under like a mediocre change I don't see
I don't think this is that big of a deal
it's just like slightly tweaking NAFTA
but the heart of it is still NAFTA and
you have people who are the free traders
who are actually taking a victory lap
over this who are like see we told
Donald Trump that free trade is a good
thing he didn't believe us well this new
agreement that he put together kind of
has that at the core of it that free
trade is good and we should all be in
favor of free trade and it's acceptable
and and there is no going back okay so
let's go to the next part labor
provisions 40 to 45 percent of
automobile parts have to be made by
workers who were in at least 16 dollars
an hour by 2020 30 Mexico has also
agreed to pass laws giving workers the
right to union representation extend
labor protections to migrant workers and
protect women from discrimination the
countries can also sanction one another
for labor violations so this is another
change that I class as a mediocre change
and here's why the overwhelming majority
the jobs in NAFTA apparently this was
already the case now I didn't know that
at first so when I read that provision I
went oh that's a good change I like that
one but then when you read more about it
you see it's just like again it's kind
of a mask to allow Trump to brag about
being Pro worker when the effective
change is nearly non-existent because
this is already the
faced with the overwhelming majority of
the jobs so now here we get to the part
where they're bragging the most about it
and I think it's fair that they brag
about it because this is a positive
change u.s. farmers get more access to
the Canadian dairy market so the u.s.
got Canada to open up its dairy market
to US farmers which was a big issue for
Trump okay that's definitely a positive
change that's good for us industry and
when you're the President of the United
States you should be a ruthless advocate
for US industry not not just the
business owners you know the the elite
class but for the workers so any step
that's a that goes in the right
direction
that helps us industry I'll take it and
I'll give you credit for it so I do I
give them credit for that one I think
that's a definitely a positive step now
here's where it all goes to [ __ ]
intellectual property and digital trade
the deal extends the terms of copyright
270 years beyond the life of the author
up from 50 it also extends the period
that a pharmaceutical drug can be
protected from generic competition so do
you understand what that is I know that
sounds really wonky but what that is in
practice is a gigantic giveaway to Big
Pharma that's what that is and this is
going to be the impact of this one of
the impacts of this is Canada just got
shafted for the cost of prescription
drugs so you know how we get price gouge
to no end in this country with our
prescription drugs
well now Trump just made it so that
Canadians get screwed over much more
with the cost of their prescription
drugs so that's a giant giveaway to the
pharmaceutical companies that was the
whole point of that but it gets even
worse this is from the Washington Post
count the oil and gas industry among the
winners of the new NAFTA or as Trump is
rebranding at the United States Mexico
Canada agreement or us MCA
the oil business convinced the White
House to keep a number of features of
the
old nafta deal in the new agreement
including provisions that help protect
US oil companies investments abroad and
allowed for tax-free transport of raw
and refined products across borders
quote were mostly happy that it's been
preserved that many of the provisions in
the original NAFTA that had supported
the integrated North American energy
markets are still in place said Aaron
Padilla senior advisor for international
policy at the American American
Petroleum Institute the nation's biggest
oil and gas lobbying group among their
biggest concerns was the preservation of
a system of resolving international
trade disputes called the investor state
dispute settlement or isds under isds
multinationals can sue the governments
of nations in which they work when those
states issue new regulations the system
has attracted critics both on the left
for the railing anti-pollution efforts
and on the right for eroding us
sovereignty Trump's trade negotiators
looked at the legal system with
skepticism to the final deal does limit
isds but with a few key exceptions oil
and gas is one of the only five economic
sectors including telecommunications and
transportation to keep isds in the
crucial Mexican market so do you
understand what what's going on here
that is and this is the heart of what so
many people objected to about TPP as
well is because it expands this notion
the idea that hey if there are foreign
governments that are screwing up your
your profits well if you're a
corporation a mega corporation just sue
the foreign government and then there'll
be this international tribunal this
board that determines who's in the right
and the corporation's would get to pick
who's on that tribunal so think about
that corporations get to override
government's when governments say hey
you're part poisoning our water system
with your shitty practices you're gonna
have to stop that we just passed a new
law that makes you stop that so it
changes
how society functions and makes it so
that the corporation can basically be
above governments on the hierarchy here
and of course if you actually have a
democracy and you believe in
enlightenment values the people have to
have a say and what happens with their
live so the government overrides
corporate rule because the government
needs to pass regulations to make sure
the corporations don't go too far and
they don't poison your water and they
don't you know hire kids and they don't
have all these labor failures and they
don't pay less than minimum wage for
example under TPP they said no we're
basically scrapping that and governments
respective governments lose their
sovereignty and these corporate
tribunals get to override loss well in
the new NAFTA they go oh yeah don't
worry if you're if you're in big oil if
you are in the telecommunications
industry if you're in five economic
sectors in total and transportation is
another one well don't worry because you
basically get to override the will of
sovereign governments you get to sue for
a loss of expected profits there was
another provision of TPP everybody's
like that's crazy
you're gonna sue a government because
you expect it to make X amount and
profit and you didn't make X amount in
profit you're gonna blame the government
for it and Sue it and then try to hose
the taxpayers to make up the difference
this is this is bending the knee to
corporate overlords this is the
corporate ah cracy coming full circle
now it's here and Trump in the
renegotiation of NAFTA put this in their
that five industries let's get to
override governments oh come on son come
on and again this is one of those issues
where the right objects to this just as
much as the left does why because when
you're putting corporations above
sovereign governments then you're
literally taking away sovereignty and
they don't want
like you know all those conspiracies
about the UN is gonna come in here and
dictate everything about our life well
what if it's not the UN but what if it's
the World Trade Organization
what if it's these giant corporate
tribunals they get to override your
democratic will because that's what
we're looking at with this new NAFTA so
you have a gigantic big pharma giveaway
you have five different industries being
able to override national sovereignty
and Donald Trump is acting like now this
is the best trade deal that's ever been
made ever now listen I'm fair I think
some of these changes we're positive
changes yes some of them were some of
them were basically fake positive
changes that were just codifying
something there already was the case so
that Trump could turn around and take
credit but ultimately you know what this
deal and by the way everything else
about the deal exactly like NAFTA so
that's another point that like the
overwhelming majority of the deal is
just hey this was called NAFTA now we're
gonna call it the United States Mexico
Canada agreement u.s. MCA and I'm gonna
pretend like it's an awesome deal now
but most of the deal is the same as it
was before so what do you mean which
gets to the main point Trump did exactly
what I told you he was going to do
whether whether it's NAFTA or TPP or you
know any of these different trade
agreements what did I tell you Donald
Trump it was a brilliant move
politically to rail against him on the
campaign trail because again these you
know so-called free trade agreements are
really outsourcing deals and they
screwed over the working class in
America so running against him was a
brilliant idea but now he's not gonna
actually buck the establishment and go
against the people who really run the
country he wants establishment approval
more than anything he wants that pat on
the head from other elitist pricks so
what do you do oh I'm a I made a new
deal it's an unbelievable deal it's a
tremendous deal here I changed like four
or five provisions of the old deal and
now I'm gonna say it's the best deal
ever when before it was the worst deal
ever very little changed
and then now I'm amazing please Pat me
on the back and tell me I'm so great I
did an unbelievable job no you didn't
meet the new boss same as the old boss
meet the new NAFTA similar to the old
NAFTA the saddest part of all this it
reminds me of a Matt Taibbi tweet from
the other day he said Donald Trump is
the kind of character that does have
that from the Republican base the
cult-like loyalty
so Trump really had a mandate to let's
say he actually got in there and he
really went full bore kind of like in an
FDR way where he said no we're gonna do
Medicare for all because remember he's
had five or six times before he was
president and even once on the campaign
trail he's running for president we're
gonna cover for everybody else what
we're gonna do we're gonna cover
everybody they say it's not a Republican
thing to say I said I don't care so any
praise the Canadian health care system
the Australian health care system the
Scottish health care system so what if
because he has this mandate from his own
base where they're never gonna turn on
him what if he went in there Andy
actually said Medicare for all no
seriously we're gonna rip up NAFTA in
we're gonna have a massively Pro worker
trade agreement we're good we are gonna
bring back manufacturing jobs we are
gonna do a new New Deal and I'm gonna
I'm gonna jam it through I don't care
well what would happen
Trump would get the Republicans cuz they
have to bend the knee to him because
he's the most popular figure among the
Republicans you know he's the one that
has that incredible devotion from his
base so the Republicans have to bend the
knee and vote for his agenda or they
know that they're they're done and they
don't have a political future and then
also if you actually did you know these
proposals like Medicare for all in a new
New Deal and and all that stuff the
Democratic base again would vote in
favor of your agenda now the
establishment Democrats wouldn't but
that would basically be the only group
of people who did not vote for it so you
had a mandate you really could have
gotten done some revolutionary
anti-establishment [ __ ] but instead what
are we doing here
we're blowing it the anti-establishment
pick is now yet again proving to be
totally pro-establishment and this is a
ruse so again Bhama had an
anti-establishment mandate he didn't
really use it
Trump had an anti-establishment mandate
he didn't really use it they all just
did tweaks around the edges and when
push came to shove either kept the
status quo going exactly like it is or
even maybe moved it in the wrong
direction
so Donald Trump always talks about how
he's a self-made billionaire he brags
about it all the time and one of his
favorite things to say and he said
there's all the time on the campaign
trail is that his dad started an amount
by giving him quote a small loan of a
million dollars that's already funny at
face value because I mean come on whose
parents kid like if your parents gave
you a loan of a million dollars
first of all whoa but second of all
would you have the nerve to say is a
small loan why give me a small loan it's
just there's no there's no sense of
scale he's just like the definition of
somebody born with a silver spoon in his
mouth except in his case it's a silver
spoon a gold spoon and a platinum spoon
he's just got spoons all up in his
orifices so I mean it's already crazy
but that that was a complete lie it's a
complete lie oh I only gave you a
million dollars only it's only a small
loan of a million dollars you're gonna
hear the details of how that's [ __ ]
there was a New York Times investigation
and it turns out that the real number in
today's dollars that he got from his dad
413 million now I think in the dollars
at the time it was like somewhere
between 200 and 280 million but in today
that's equal to 413 million but I mean
the fact that matter is the guy got over
200 million dollars from his daddy and
he had the nerve to go out there has the
nerve to go out there and brag about how
he's a self-made man and then another
thing that Trump does is he always talks
about how oh my dad you know he was he
was a small fish I was I'm the real big
fish because my dad always used to tell
me son don't go building in Manhattan
because that's where the players are and
Trump ended up going to Manhattan to
build in Manhattan but he would always
downplay how successful and wealthy his
father was in an attempt to play up how
brilliant of a businessman he is but
you're about to see again
how that is utter nonsense because he
was trying to downplay his dad's wealth
on purpose there's a very clear reason
why he did it and it's not just for his
ego although I do think his ego plays a
role in it there was a very clear
criminal reason why he kept downplaying
his father's wealth so Trump's parents
and okay so you're gonna see here tax
dodging schemes that's what that's what
this all was that's how he was able to
get the wealth from his dad it was
through tax dodging schemes that
enriched him it because they're evading
taxes in a criminal fashion Trump and
his siblings so Trump's parents
transferred more than 1 billion dollars
to all of their children combined and
get this they paid about fifty two point
two million dollars in taxes so when you
transfer over a billion dollars and
you're paying fifty two point two
million dollars you are dodging the
relevant taxes that you have to pay so
given the relevant tax rates on gifts
and inheritance at the time they should
have paid five hundred and fifty million
dollars but they paid fifty two point
two million so they were supposed to pay
ten times more than what they paid okay
quote all told the Times documented 295
streams of revenue that Fred Trump
created over five decades to enrich his
son in most cases his four other
children benefited equally but over time
as Donald Trump careened from one
financial disaster to the next his
father found ways to give him
substantially more money records show
even so in 1990 according to previously
secret depositions mr. Trump tried to
have his father's will rewritten in a
way that Fred Trump alarmed and angered
feared could result in his empires being
used to bail out his sons failing
businesses that's an unbelievable fact
so there's this story that's famous that
David Cay Johnston I believe report
originally and I don't think other
mainstream outlets had like verified it
yet and said yeah it turns out that's
true but through their own investigation
they found this out as well there was a
time when Trump's casinos were just
about to go belly-up in in I think the
early 1990s and his dad in order to bail
out his son what he did is he went into
one of trumps casinos bought over three
million dollars in chips and then just
left didn't play any games nothing
bought through over three million
dollars in chips and then just left that
was the money the Trump needed in order
to make a payment so it he didn't get
absolutely obliterated and his casinos
go belly-up so his daddy ran in and
saved him but it turns out according to
the New York Times investigation and
they did extensive interviews and had
you know did endless documents including
Fred Trump's own financial statements
and tax returns and things of that
nature it turns out Trump's daddy set up
295 revenue streams for him and Trump
still thought that's not enough I have
to get control of his will so when his
dad was you know he getting dementia he
tries to gain control of his will and
then in doing that Trump wants to shaft
his siblings and give himself even more
money to try to bail out his failing
empire and remember it is a known fact
that Trump's businesses went bankrupt
six times six times so again this guy is
the definition of a pampered little prep
school prick being born with a silver
spoon in his mouth along with the
platinum spoon and a gold spoon I mean
this guy he's like the poster boy of
entitlement and privilege and he has the
nerve to go around and pretend like who
me
no I'm tremendous I'm unbelievable I'm
the best businessman that's ever been
okay now I'm gonna get to
my favorite part of this story oh man is
this gonna get you mad in 1997 for
example about a year and a half before
Fred Trump's death Donald and his
siblings gained control of most of their
father's Empire they undervalued the
properties significantly claiming they
were worth 40 1 point 4 million and
selling them off over the next 10 years
for 16 times that amount the transfer of
wealth between Fred Trump and Donald
Trump as well as his other siblings was
a lifetime affair all right let me just
pause that's actually not my favorite
part I'll get to my favorite part but
this was one of the tricks that they
used they take the property from their
dad and they drastically drastically
undervalue the properties and then they
sell them later on for 16 times the
amount now they didn't actually
appreciate that much in value again it's
a tax dodging scam where you say what do
you mean this piece of property is only
worth $100,000 not 1.5 million dollars
so I'm paying that lower you know that
lower amount in taxes because I'm under
valuing my property on purpose now we
know today for example Donald Trump
still does this with his golf courses
and some of his other properties and
this is guys I mean this is one example
of many where it's not even like oh it's
a legal tax evasion scheme this is
illegal
like he's committed fraud repeatedly
that's clear and you could you get the
sense of it when you read the entire New
York Times article you walk away and
your jaw's on the floor and you're going
what the [ __ ] and it's a clear example
of how when you're rich and connected
and you pay off politicians through
campaign contributions that are
legalized bribes you basically get away
with what I thought you want to get away
with and that's kind of what happened so
again he's the poster boy of entitlement
and in many ways - poster boy the
establishment because and you get the
sense about his dad that his dad
actually was crafty not
he's a good person he's not because
there were all the issues him and Donald
Trump with you know basically not
renting to black people on their
properties on purpose so they were you
know racially discriminating and there's
been lawsuits over that and things of
that nature that he wasn't a good guy
but he was definitely clever from a
business perspective where he worked
overtime to try to find out okay how can
we dodge our taxes and how can we like
I'm sure that he and his lawyers were
trying to find ways where they had a leg
to stand on where they would argue hey
what do you mean this is totally legal
you'd left a loophole in there and I'm
just using that loophole if you want to
if you want to stop this practice close
the loophole but there were instances of
where they go way too far under valuing
the properties on purpose and getting
away with it that's one of those
instances where no you actually are
committing a crime but there was no
punishment there was no punishment okay
now here's the best part by age three
mr. Trump was earning $200,000 a year in
today's dollars from his father's Empire
he was a millionaire by age eight by the
time he was 17 his father had given him
part ownership of a 52 unit apartment
building soon after mr. Trump graduated
from college he was receiving the
equivalent of $1,000,000 a year from his
father the money increased with the
years to more than five million dollars
annually in his 40s and 50s I'm gonna
say this again Donald Trump is a giant
fraud he painted this picture of himself
as a brilliant businessman and he tried
to equate his name with success through
you know sheer force of will and
marketing but the reality is he's one of
the most entitled people in the country
I mean he $200,000 a year by age three
millionaire by age eight he did nothing
and again his own businesses went
bankrupt six times he couldn't find a
way to make a [ __ ] casino profitable
listen if Donald Trump didn't have his
rich daddy Donald Trump would be lucky
to be a bartender
and I'm not I don't want to I hesitate
saying that because I feel like that's
unfair to bartenders bartenders
there are many brilliant bartenders who
are really intelligent people who have
that you know and they have a hard time
finding other work and they say hey [ __ ]
it all you like being a bartender or
else be a bartender but the point is
it's not like this guy if yeah if it was
actually an even playing field and we
actually lived in here's the point a
meritocracy
there's no way Donald Trump would have
won the race of life he's the best
evidence I've ever seen that we don't
live in a meritocracy guys he is a
welfare case and again that's unfair to
to people who are on real welfare I
genuinely think that's unfair to them
because this guy's just handed hundreds
of millions of dollars gets to go
bankrupt six times gets to be a joke of
a person who's really not that
intelligent but he gets to sell this
image and he did of being a success and
then he got elected president we don't
live in a meritocracy this guy had
everything handed to him from when he
was a kid and he's too selfish to
acknowledge it you know it'd be one
thing if he was humble about it and he
said you know what I'm lucky enough I
came from a wealthy family and my my
father passed on to myself and my
siblings passed on to us a decent amount
of money and I understand that that
gives me a leg up on everybody else and
so what I want to do is give everybody
equal opportunity and give everybody the
chances that I had in this wonderful
country if that was his take on it I
don't think anybody would begrudge him
you know being inherited a lot of money
I mean we'd still go after him if he
committed crimes like they did and they
committed fraud we'd still have to go
after him for that but nobody would
begrudge him on a personal level like
okay well at least he's honest about the
fact that he got some of the money and
that
now he has that privilege so he wants to
try to build a bridge for everybody
behind him to get the same shot at being
a success story but he's not like that
he's not like that at all and it's the
exact opposite like I said he always
talked about how and you're gonna have
to I remember back in the day I was
reading an article about Trump's father
and the reports were oh no Trump's
father was only worth like only by the
way hilarious to say that but in the
context of what Trump says he's worth
now it is important
four hundred million dollars his dad was
worth well now we know that's actually
not true his dad was a billionaire and
transferred a lot of that money by
committing crimes to his siblings I mean
you know to his his kids and trumpet his
siblings got away with it and the the
scams get so intricate that there's no
doubt that they knew what they were
doing I mean one of them is they opened
up this Center for this business for all
of like you know the services that they
would need for within their properties
so you know you have this thing okay we
do plumbing and we do [ __ ] we're
electricians and we you know buy the
furniture and all that and what they do
is they mark up on the books they mark
up massively the cost of of the goods so
let's say whatever a ladder or a [ __ ]
couch furniture and then what happens is
you take the difference in the massive
markup and you're just funneling that
tax-free to your pampered prick kids so
let's say the desk for argument's sake
costs $100 well you mark it down in the
books as no it's three hundred dollars
and two hundred of those dollars just
gets funneled tax-free to Silverspoon
Donny here so that I mean that's one of
the ways but again the the Times article
goes into massive detail for all the
different ways because not for all of
them because there's 295
five different revenue streams the point
is these were schemes these were tax
avoidance scams some of them may be
legal in the sense that they're going
through a legal loophole but others are
not and fraud is clearly something they
committed now I don't know the statute
of limitations may be up on stuff like
this but just keep in mind who this guy
is
and this dovetails interestingly with a
story that we covered factor in the end
of the campaign where we learned that
Trump repeatedly shaft shafted his uh
the people who actually did the work
inside his hotels people who were
electricians were plumbers were and did
work for him there was this long article
I forget who originally did it but they
went and spoke to the people like I was
Trump's electrician he shafted me
$60,000 worth and that that's a long
list of people he shafted and again
another thing is he hires oftentimes
undocumented immigrants to work on his
you know on his buildings and then he
turns around and rails against other
companies for hiring undocumented
immigrants and he acts like I'm mr. hard
line on immigration so massive hypocrisy
on top of outsourcing I mean he's got
businesses around the world too so as he
claims he's against outsourcing he does
that so listen he's a pathological liar
and he's a fraud in every sense of the
word and I think that's important and
what I'll do is I'll leave the the New
York Times article below me here you can
go through it yourself it's in the video
description box you can go through
yourself and really get all the details
of it because even my segment here
doesn't do it full justice you've got a
lot of the important information like
how much money he was making when he was
a child but there's even more in there
you should definitely check it out the
guy's a fraud and the reason why he
screams fake news is because oftentimes
all he does is scream fake news whenever
stories paint him in a negative light
that's his trick when he screams fake
news sometimes I scream fake news at the
media but I do that when they're
actually doing fake news like when they
push for the war in Iraq for example
when they were cheering on the war in
Syria or when Jake Tapper did a non fact
check fact check of Medicare for all
Trump - screams fake news for
self-preservation because oftentimes
they accurately check his ass and then
the only way he has to get out of it is
I don't know fake no something anything
that's ever bad about me ever is fake
news well the amount of detail that went
into this piece and this is true
investigative journalism and this is
something that really should be talked
about and I do think it's relevant to
the kind of man that we have in office
and to his character
hello everybody you know I'm here with
Corrin we're gonna do a quick little
podcast for y'all and I do mean quick
today because Koren just got walloped
over the head with the anvil of a long
ass update yeah so it's one of those
things where like my computer is working
right now but it's almost like I want to
fight I want to fight my computer right
now yeah it's like literally the worst
time it hit you with Oh we're gonna
update your [ __ ] and how long would you
say went up like an hour all right about
right
was it an hour I think so I mean I could
see yeah yep probably like an hour in it
look at the timestamp on your original
text about it hi st. you ready for no
reason
I just called I am mad because like it's
working right now but an hour of my life
it was not working so it's like now it's
like yeah you can use me now
but I see no improvements to my [ __ ] at
my shits not going faster it doesn't do
backflips isn't doing nothing special
flips right the first one you sent me
mm-hmm
about it were you showed the screen and
the screen said about 23 minutes
remaining mm-hmm
that [ __ ] was over an hour ago it was
absurd it was an hour 15 minutes ago and
that's why I'm skeptical of every update
with iPhone because when they tell you
to update there's no like some people
lost pictures with the latest update you
heard about that that's what I'm saying
I think oh I want those airheads all
those are the sour joints that are like
in the little square shape oh I'm sorry
that's the problem though we should be
able to pass stuff through a computer at
this point technology that's a good
place yeah I know put it here and press
a button and then you get some yeah like
I should be able to smell your breath
through a phone call I don't want to but
there should be technology like and if
you're talking like Stephen a Smith or
something like that I should feel if
you're spitting on me and be like you'll
back up from the phone well they have
don't they have like really shitty like
sex things now
where you call like trying to simulate
having long-distance sex but it's just
not the same but you like you put some
some machine thing on your dick really
yeah I don't even know with this what is
this it's a phone call through your do
it like yeah it's like a Skype where you
could actually have sex but it's like
fake sex from long distance we're like
you know you can move in a certain way
and the person will feel you moving that
way yep I feel like that might exist now
I don't even know what that is that
that's like some beyond virtual reality
[ __ ] word yeah like I like augmented
reality Typekit I'm like going like this
and you can feel me like grabbing your
boobs
mm-hmm yeah what and now they just
opened up like a robot brothel you see
that like a sex doll brothel were the
dolls of mad real I think they did want
to Amsterdam what and then they want us
to do one in was it like Houston or
something it was someplace in Texas but
then I think politicians are trying to
get a shutdown even though they're
secretly like going to that [ __ ] yeah
it's all [ __ ] grandstanding like
what about the kids we need to not
embrace this as a society so you're
kidding me you can go online and see any
kind of porn ever made ever and like
you're concerned about having a place
where people go to I thought robots like
it's yeah that's I'm still mad at my
computer I'm tight that this [ __ ] is
allowing me to work right now because
like there should be something different
like I should see like my like a
document should look different or Skype
should look different or my desktop
should look different this [ __ ] looks
the same it feels the same and actual
towers updates but it's like little
glitch fixes and security updates and
[ __ ] but I'm skeptical the iPhone ones
because if you talk to anybody with an
old iPhone like the old old old ones
like the small brick ones that have
never updated they say they're good
they're don't have any problems their
battery's fine it still does everything
it needs but then you ask anybody with
the new ones who are always updating
they always have problem
or their photos get deleted like for
that well sometimes they update and then
they're glitchy at first and then they
have to release update to the update
there's a dog in here should show your
dog this [ __ ] was bugging out but they
say they say they're making updates but
I think they're just secretly ruining
your phone so you gotta keep buying the
new [ __ ] that's just interesting
conspiracy but I mean they'll do update
and then sometimes is glitchy and then
they release update to the update yeah
that's from saying what are you updating
you've had four years to create this
phone now you find it some [ __ ] wrong
with like I'm just skeptical that I
think they're ruining your phone so you
keep got a but you gotta keep buying a
new one which it doesn't surprise me
because like we've said this before they
could come out with some technology to
create like a endless battery but
instead they create a battery that dies
eventually and you got to keep buying a
new one dude these phones come out so
fast it's amazing how quick they come
out right well would it like every year
or something like that
yeah but time [ __ ] flies does I got
so I have gotten an iPhone 7 mm-hmm just
close to when it came out like kind of
close to when he came out but what
happened was I bought it the battery was
always just trashed son to to to to to
to trash and then I I think in
conversation with you you kind of relate
to me like yo your [ __ ] is actually
defective it's not there was a big
problem with batteries or people were
going back and then they were testing
them at the store and finding they were
wrong like oh that's just that it's a
bad battery like it is literally
defective like there's a problem with it
I dealt with it I said [ __ ] it I don't
care I'm the type of dude when I get a
phone I'll keep that [ __ ] for five six
years I don't give up yeah I've always
been like that so the battery is a big
[ __ ] problem especially when you're
using your phone all the time if you
can't leave your house in the morning
and like May
when you're in the car or something like
that to a car charger and you know bring
it back up a little bit to like 60 64
like you can't get through your whole
day with 65 percent which is a lot of
battery no way I could gotten through a
day with 65 percent I told you I would
go to sleep with my [ __ ] on 80 percent
you wake in the morning look at it it's
like 45 percent yeah see that to me
makes absolutely no sense not using it
in a sleep mode yeah so then what
happened was the screen cracked and it
cracked hard to the point where one time
I was rub rolling my finger broke
scrubbing one out and I got the glass
stuck in my finger like a little piece
of glass like came out and I was like ow
and I had to [ __ ] like get tweezers
and get the little thing out well it and
then put like peroxide on my finger and
stuff and yeah it was a problem and then
even after all of that [ __ ] I was like
I'm not getting a new phone it was like
it was almost on principle it was like
I'm not I just ate iPhone 7 iPhone Jurek
spensive I'm like I'm on yeah it's just
a lot of money on this phone I'm not
getting another [ __ ] phone and then
finally the battery like got even worse
and I was like I don't have a choice now
yeah that's what I did is when the
iPhone X came out that's the new [ __ ]
right well no now I think they have
something beyond X right now well the
iPhone 8 plus went on sale I was like
I'm gonna get the A+ because the A+ has
it has a home button and [ __ ] yep not
like X absolutely plus I got to eat plus
so isn't it weird like the that an
iPhone now is like the new like piece of
wood for people back in the day like
we're getting splinters from iPhones
like nobody [ __ ] does handcrafting
[ __ ] anymore we all like like hurt our
hands from from an iPhone like I've got
cracks in my screen and if I put my hand
over a certain spot it'll like scratch
it a little bit or some [ __ ] it's
[ __ ] how many cracks do you have is
your [ __ ] [ __ ] out mine was super
[ __ ] up I've got a good like if you
get the screen protector privacy thing
it doesn't really it sort of is like a
blocker for your phone if you drop it
but I always get it on the new one up
I gotta get a new one no one I never did
I didn't have a case on the old one I
mean I take the train to work and I like
I used to sit on the train in New York
and I would like be one of those people
that like just look at people's phones
and if you could see people's whole
shits I don't want someone like sitting
next to me just reading my whole thing
or like watching like I'm watching Ozark
right now there's a couple scenes where
they go into the strip club in there
like showing cities and stuff so if
someone randomly looks at my phone at
that point and see some titties on my
phone they're gonna think I'm the
biggest creep ever so what do you mean
the screen protector blocks him from
seeing it yeah oh hell yeah if you're
sitting next to me or standing over me
like my whole screen looks grey like
you'd have to look get on directly for
it to be oh really it's a wonder that
doesn't look like it does that so I have
a white iPhone and it turns like my
screen protector looks like gray hmm
press the button so I could die so you
see like the background but now turn it
sideways oh [ __ ] yes well that's crazy
mine is not like that mine is not like
that yeah this is this is a good one
it's like a security privacy [ __ ] I
think it was like 16 dollars or
something like that it's not just the
regular Oh like like scream plasticky
thing that's what's up that's pretty
cool yeah I like it a lot and you could
still see your phone good you got to put
your brightness up a little bit more
which hurts the battery a little bit but
if you if you got a new phone with good
battery it'll still last a while I'm a
high brightness dude I love high
brightness I can't like I get mad if I
look at a phone and it's just it's a
little too dim the only [ __ ] I don't
like is in in my car you can dim like
your dashboard lights and stuff like
that mm-hmm
I don't like those so bright okay I said
I think I like those bright too but we
think we spoke about this those like
neon colors are so like just beautiful
inside of a brand new car I'm like a I'm
like a [ __ ] fruit fly deep down
because I just get attracted to a light
like if it's like bright and neon and
people can tell that's why secular talk
colors are like that bright ass green
[ __ ]
that's why we're so attracted to Vegas
cuz it's just like all them yeah like
it's just so I'm fascinated by some
people's iPhone screens because
[ __ ] [ __ ] will be cracked as
[ __ ] you ever seen people with like
how's my [ __ ] no but like some people's
[ __ ] is like there's cracks all over
that was yours that bad it was bad
really it was really bad everybody will
comment on you if it's the first time
somebody saw it there's like a 100
percent chance they're gonna comment on
it that's how bad it was damn cuz like a
little bit just read someone's tweet
what's that you can miss read someone's
tweet because of a crackers there were
some there lines going over in it's more
like a straight down direction but it
did kind of distort not whole words but
letters for sure damn it was bad that
would have gotten me pissed right away I
like big cracks my scream would I
couldn't have dealt with that [ __ ] I
need to see what's going on in my screen
well I'm just the type of person that
likes to keep a phone for a long time
and feel like I got use out of it yeah
so I was like I fought it for so long
and then I was like but anyway I was
gonna say felt like I got that iPhone 7
yesterday but it wasn't it was like
[ __ ] 2 years ago probably I know I
think back of all the other shit's like
the arm would they have the iPod like
minis and like the diesel iPods and then
they had the mini was like the little
square ones on it yeah just to play
music which is like that that's just a
little function of your phone now yeah
and you can't even see who's what song
it is and you can do what like 200 songs
or something like that it's one like the
Apple watch is gonna be like
non-existent there's gonna be like a
Apple well they said Google Glasses was
a big old flop right that's it was
terrible nobody even wanted it
hell no I well why would you want to
wear some like put all that energy
you're putting in glasses for like like
a contact lens or some [ __ ] like that
you know
yes I'm augmented-reality [ __ ] with the
contact lens we're like you could like I
could this this phone
Plus has augmented reality it has like a
game where it's like you can you know
how when you go to take a picture go to
do a video mm-hmm you see what's in
front of you and like on the floor in
front of you you can like do building
blocks or some [ __ ]
it's kind of cool it's kind of quits but
if they do that with like a contact then
you could literally be walking around
and adding like [ __ ] Pokemon
characters and people just think you see
only them but it's like no I see you and
I see Pokemon characters yeah they think
[ __ ] sexual harassment is bad now
you've got some like Google contact
lenses and you were just grabbing that
[ __ ] you be like what what I wear the
Google contact lenses yeah you could
like be at their events picture somebody
groping somebody or something in public
yeah and that's I mean that that's a
weird that's like a weird middle ground
right when it comes to privacy versus
freedom like does the person who's
standing there let's say on the subway
let's say there's a creepy dude who's
got that this contact that allows
reality to him to [ __ ] with reality and
like he's picturing through his contact
some dude like [ __ ] this person who's
on the subway you know like he's just
picturing it and he can see it in the
contact like just added some dude like a
big old dick just [ __ ] this person
right like does that person have a right
to not have some dude like put an
augmented reality fake person there
[ __ ] them you know I'm saying like or
does or does that dude have the ability
to say yo listen it's not real number
one number two this person doesn't even
know I'm doing it you know yeah I don't
know it's a weird I mean that's a weird
middle ground isn't it I think that's a
interesting clever weird middle ground
yeah I feel like also in like the Jersey
like judicial system all there's always
a weird they can find a weird like way
to fight something you know like some
defense they can pull it together like
well yeah because and actually the it's
a brilliant part of our legal system but
you have to prove beyond
reasonable doubt so it's like the burden
of proof it's innocent until proven
guilty so it's like you have to come
correct if you're trying to prove
somebody guilty you can't just come with
circumstantial [ __ ] you can't but
sometimes like the [ __ ] is just obvious
you know and it's just like a no-brainer
but I guess yeah if sometimes like
finding so much evidence is hard to do
sometimes it's yes like the theory is
we'd rather have a hundred guilty people
walk free then have one innocent person
be locked up well it's better to [ __ ] up
on that side of it than the other side
of it where you just lock people up who
are innocent because Locke which we do
anyway which does happen yeah that does
happen for sure
well yeah that's weird I mean I think
people were saying that that actually is
the next thing like the next thing is
the augmented reality [ __ ] where you
could like like I could have let's say
this laptop that I'm talking to you on
mm-hmm I could it could just not even be
there and it could be a [ __ ] contact
where it's there just through the
contact but it's not there in real life
you know I'm saying yeah I mean I don't
know it's it's well they're coming
really when they plant chips in us I
think so like new babies I think so or
like not even not even forced by the
government but like parents will say oh
I have to get my baby the new whatever
chip the new Apple chip and then they
put the chip in their [ __ ] brain and
that chip allows them to do augmented
reality and stuff and allows them to
learn faster and [ __ ] like that I think
so I think there's got to be some weird
[ __ ] coming right because nobody could
have foreseen the internet in [ __ ]
1975 I mean look at LASIK eye surgery
just as a thing you know like if someone
told you you're gonna you're gonna do
surgery to your eyes so you don't have
to wear contacts or glasses anymore like
that concept seems so crazy like almost
seems twenty years ago it seems fake
yeah cuz if they use a laser right don't
they use a laser yeah they'd appeal
Becca's skin of your eyes like so the
skin papillary or the focal area but I
think I don't know there was that
episode of black mirror where
put the chip inside the girl did you see
that one trying to remember she was like
a young girl and they programmed her
with this chip so she can like so the
mom can spy on her the mom could spy on
all that like an iPad and walk by the
dog it like poured out the dog so she
never saw it fear or anything like that
that was a good episode that sure was a
mad good episode but like at the end
she's beating up her mom but she doesn't
see the like pain she's like inflicting
in her because it's all getting bored
out yeah because that's all she learned
yeah which is we sort of do that in a
way anyway I mean if you're walking on
the street and you know there's a bomb
or something up on the on the on the
street you're gonna you know walk on the
other side if you have some kids or
something like that whereas if they're
younger I mean if I like my daughter
I'll walk her past them like a bomb or
some weird [ __ ] so she's exposed to it
because if not so never Beeks but you
know as if she is the bomb look at him
cuz I think when the girl she took she
had her mom take the censor [ __ ] off
yeah and they just walked past the dog
and was like all scared and like didn't
know what to do and [ __ ] so it's like
you got to put yourself in these weird
awkward situations or have some weird
[ __ ] happen to get some real life
lessons when the mom was watching her
[ __ ] that was so creepy
yeah that was oh it's like yeah you're
seriously invading her privacy like on a
level that should be like illegal mm-hm
yeah that's crazy
but I mean that seemed realistic she put
the chip at her too young it seemed Khan
realistic it also seemed realistic that
episode again I think we spoke about
this but when the dudes when the this
woman's boyfriend dies and then there's
this company that just gives you like a
real-life doll that's super lifelike and
they also it also has AI so it took all
of his social media posts and created
his personality based off of everything
he's ever said in social media yeah it
Brett Kavanaugh had a hearing what was
it three or four days ago now and it
went on pretty much all day and it was
the biggest news story of the day by far
every outlet was talking nonstop about
it well I had to chime in I know this is
after the fact but I had to chime in on
a particular part of it I'm gonna play
this for you and then we'll discuss it
but this is Lindsey Graham absolutely
losing his mind during the hearing and
he's gonna go over the top in his
defense of Brett Kavanaugh take a look
are you aware that at 9:23 on the night
of July the 9th the day you were
nominated to the Supreme Court by
President Trump Senator Schumer said 23
minutes after your nomination I will
oppose judge Cavanaugh his nomination
with everything I have I have a
bipartisan and I hope a bipartisan
majority will do the same the stakes are
simply too high for anything less well
if you weren't aware of it you are now
did you meet with Senator Dianne
Feinstein on August 20th I did meet with
Sarah fines did you know that her staff
had already recommended a lawyer to dr.
Ford I did not know that did you know
that her and her staff had this
allergies allegations for over 20 days I
did not know that at the time if you
wanted an FBI investigation you could
have come to us what you want to do is
destroy this guy's life hold this seat
open and hope you win in 2020 you said
that not me you've got nothing to
apologize for when you see Sotomayor and
Kagan tell them it Lindsey said all
because I voted for them I would never
do to them what you've done to this guy
this is the most unethical sham since
I've been in politics and if you really
wanted to know the truth you sure as
hell wouldn't have done what you've done
to this guy are you a gang rapist
No
I cannot imagine what you and your
family were going through boy y'all want
power god I hope you never get it I hope
the American people can see through this
sham that you knew about it and you held
it you had no intention of protecting
dr. fort none she's as much of a victim
as you are god I hate to say it cuz
these have been my friends but let me
tell you when it comes to this you're
looking for a fair process you came to
the wrong town at the wrong time my
friend do you consider this a job
interview
the advise and consent role is like a
job consider that you've been through a
job interview I've been through a
process of advice and consent under the
Constitution would you say you've been
through hell I've been through hell and
then some this is not a job interview
yeah this is hell this this is going to
destroy the ability of good people to
come forward because of this crap your
high school yearbook you have interacted
with professional women all your life
not one accusation you're supposed to be
Bill Cosby when you're a junior and
senior and high school and all of a
sudden you got over it
spend my understanding that if you drug
women and rape them for two years in
high school you probably don't stop
here's my understanding if you lived a
good life people would recognize it like
the American Bar Association has the
gold standard his integrity is
absolutely unquestioned he is the very
circumspect in his personal conduct
harbors no biases or prejudices he's
entirely ethical is a really decent
person
he has warm friendly unassuming he's the
nicest person the ABA one thing I can
tell you you should be proud of Ashley
you should be proud of this that you've
raised a daughter
who had the good character to pray for
dr. Ford to my Republican colleagues if
you vote no you're legitimizing the most
despicable thing I have seen in my time
in politics you want this seat I hope
you never get it I hope you're on the
Supreme Court that's exactly where you
should be and I hope that the American
people will see through this charade and
I wish you well and I intend to vote for
you and I hope everybody who's
fair-minded will Oh pipe down you
melodramatic prick Jesus Christ I mean
you want to talk about turning the
theatrics up to 11 for no goddamn reason
so let's let's break this down here I
want to go through a bunch of his points
because I think responding to it is
important so at the beginning he says
before he gets all flustered and starts
yelling if you wanted an FBI
investigation you could have come to us
well that's exactly what the Democrats
have been calling for for an extended
period of time now I actually have
disagreements with them on that I would
prefer a criminal investigation because
if these charges are true well then have
a criminal investigation look into it
because now there's not even just one
allegation there's you know four or five
and if anybody wants to get to the to
the truth and wants to hold somebody
accountable like any other person would
be held accountable well then you should
have some sort of a criminal
investigation now to be fair I'm not
sure what the statute of limitations is
but the allegations at least in the case
of dr. Christine Blasi Ford it's it's
attempted rape
so that strikes me as an incredibly
serious charge and crime and listen if
you're somebody who's as well I don't
believe it well then you have nothing to
fear from a criminal investigation
because it will clear his name so I have
a different approach than the Democrats
but when Lindsey Graham says oh you know
hey you should have been reasonable and
called for an FBI investigate
well that's exactly what they're doing
that's all I heard from every Democrat
was let's have an FBI investigation so
for you to now pretend like well you
should have done this thing that you're
doing it's like that makes no sense
that's exactly what they're calling for
right now and then there's another part
in the hearing where they said to
Cavanaugh like oh because Cavanaugh said
repeatedly throughout the hearing like
I'm in favor of clearing my name with an
investigation but then when asked
directly like okay so will you will you
recommend right now an FBI investigation
into it he would always kind of dodged
the question and tap-dance around it so
it's so weird that like what you're
getting all worked up and you're getting
angry when the Democrats are calling for
exactly what you said they should call
for just incredibly weird then he says
ah the Democrats are trying to hold this
seat open
listen Neal Gorsuch skated by and got
right in the court with barely a whimper
okay so clearly the Democrats and this
is to my dismay I wish they would fight
hard and I wish wish they would obstruct
on issues where they should obstruct
because you are the opposition party but
Gorsuch there wasn't a sexual assault
allegation against him there wasn't much
of a resistance to him and he flew by
and he got on the court so this idea of
like oh this is all mucked up that's
what this is well if it's mucked up why
wouldn't they have tried it with the
first pick in the ogor such I mean again
your arguments that they're making just
don't make sense or the arguments that
Lindsey Graham is making it just doesn't
make sense
and then the other point is you're gonna
now be concerned about holding a seat up
what about Merrick garland there well
what they broke the record of not even
holding a hearing for the guy Bhama had
like something like over a year left in
his presidency like I see what happened
was you can't have it's a new a new rule
we just came up with it's you can't the
year the last year of a presidency you
can't
before the election you can't you know
what what are you gonna do you you can't
put somebody on the Supreme Court
because it's a year before the next
election well by that logic it's not a
year until the midterms it's a less than
a year until the elections in fact the
elections are very close the midterm so
by your own logic sorry that you set the
standard and now the Democrats are doing
something similar but you set the
standard now didn't you okay then
classic Lindsey Graham nonsense this is
the most unethical sham since I've been
in politics now I'm gonna get in other
stories I'm gonna get to how that's just
literally not true and that Cavanaugh
lied repeatedly and there are there's
merit and there's evidence to back up
the allegations now you could say oh
this shouldn't be brought up anyway okay
that that's that's a position that you
could take but the idea that oh it's an
unethical sham and there's nothing to
this no but there is something to it and
it's actually been it's it's fairly
provable in my opinion based on the
evidence that we already have again I'll
get to that later stories and I'll lay
that out for you in detail because
Cavanaugh repeatedly committed perjury
it's not even close it's just obvious
how many times he lied and and the
evidence that dr. Bazzi fort has for her
so to call it an unethical sham is just
not true and then also here's a guy
who's been for every single offensive
war since he's been in politics that's
not an exaggeration when he ran for
president by the way lol he ran for
president this is the guy who said
openly I think it was an interview with
CNBC he's like he was asked hey so how
do we you get out of Iraq he says you
don't leave you stay there so a guy who
voted for an offensive war illegal war
under international law against a
country that didn't attack us and then
we occupied that country then we ordered
torture to cover it up a guy who voted
for the Patriot Act which of course you
know legalized warrantless
unconstitutional NSA spying that guy is
now saying this is the most unethical
sham since I've been in politics what I
mean come on man that's
an insane thing to say it's an insane
thing to say and how angry he gets
pisses me off more than anything because
it's like dude some of these Wars killed
literally hundreds of thousands of
innocent people not only did he not
raise his voice in opposition to it he
didn't have any opposition to it and in
fact he actively supported these wars so
spare me I mean it's it's when another
entitled pampered prep school prick gets
called out on his garbage that Lindsey
Graham melts down I mean that's what
this is by the way these allegations
before Trump even picked Kavanagh these
allegations were out when there was the
list that said oh here the potential
Supreme Court picks dr. Christine Blasi
for said Brett Kavanaugh did this to me
so even before he was picked this was
out there and dr. Christine Blasi
foretold her a therapist in 2012 hey I
was sexually assaulted somebody
attempted to rape me it was Brett
Kavanaugh and you know the other guy was
in the room whatever his name is he put
his hand over her mouth and tried to
force himself on her but it's one other
elitists who have the proper pedigree
yes are called out on their [ __ ]
that they that they saved their anger
for those moments and it's all my
reputation has been harmed by
unbelievable terrible things you've kind
of aback a lot about my reputation I
think your reputation is ruined enough
by your own actions and by your own
judicial philosophy by the way which is
another thing the Democrats should be
resisting on unfortunately they're only
resisting in regards to his personal
conduct and then he goes on to say well
if there was one allegation what the
hell there's usually many allegations so
obviously you didn't do it cuz there's
only one allegation first of all that's
hilarious that what it is impossible for
there to be one allegation against
somebody that's just not true of course
it's possible for that happen that's
happened many times sure you could say
there's a pattern of if there's one
there's many but to say like oh if
there's not many therefore it's [ __ ]
I mean what a flimsy [ __ ] argument
and then furthermore there are multiple
allegations so he's just ignoring it or
lying about it and then finally he says
if you vote no you're legitimizing
something despicable here and this is
the heart of the pathetic charade that
is Lindsey Graham's faux anger here now
he's made it so that oh if you vote no
you're you're legitimizing the charade
so in other words on judicial philosophy
you cannot oppose capital because
obviously on that front
well we he's perfect for their job and
that is the heart of what I hate about
what Lindsey Graham is doing here
because that implication is utter
garbage even if you frame it from the
Republican perspective like oh if you're
a Republican obviously you would support
this guy and don't give in to this
charade no but if you're a Republican
for example there are some conservatives
in the house who would say you know what
I genuinely don't like big government
Brett Kavanaugh in his decisions has
come out in favor of warrantless
unconstitutional NSA spying on everybody
collecting everybody's metadata so from
a principled conservative perspective
his ideology is wrong and I don't agree
with that so I'm not gonna vote for him
but again Lindsey Graham frames that
like no that's not a thing it's not a
thing to reasonably disagree with
Kavanagh even putting the allegations
aside it's not a thing to reasonably
disagree with Cavanaugh on his judicial
philosophy so you have to vote for him
now because you don't want to legitimize
something despicable it's just that's
garbage Lindsey that's not our argument
that's not a point that's a dumb
preposterous silly thing to say but you
said it anyway because you save all your
anger and all your outrage for defending
this [ __ ] jack jackass jackoff
probably shouldn't say jackoff in this
context but that's that's what you're
gonna do this is the hill you want to
die on the hill you want to die on pick
another paper prep school prick pick
another one
CNN did a panel talk with female Trump
voters to see what they think of the
upcoming midterms so let's see what they
had to say and then we'll talk about it
how many of you feel that you want to
send a message of some kind with the
midterm vote tell me more I feel at age
44 when I am living paycheck to paycheck
and concerned about my future but more
importantly my daughter's I feel like
there's a lot riding on the elections
coming up because you're from Wisconsin
I am and so that was a state that handed
president Trump a victory that was
unexpected let's just say I voted for
Obama in eighth and I ended up voting
for Trump it was very difficult for me
but I knew at that moment that I wanted
change and for me he represented that
change what is your plan for how you
plan to vote now for the midterms at
this I plan to vote Republican I am very
confident in the economic status of
where we're at now what Trump has done
and hopefully what he can continue to do
in the future if he has the support
behind him he is a very flawed human
being but aren't we all I kind of am a
split person my children say I'm a very
confused Democrat because I vote
Republican but now I find that the I
like at the local level the Democrats
the ones who are affecting my life every
day why do the Democrats speak to you
more now I think that they're more into
social justice and the social programs
we want to make a difference in the
lives of these people that are not
seeing what everyone else is seeing is
any part of your vote in the midterm
going to send a message you hope to
President Trump do you feel differently
about your vote today for him oh I
definitely feel different about my vote
for him you know he voted my Christian
values I was hoping he would probably be
more of the candidate that would deliver
that for me
and I still maintain hope that his
Supreme Court pics are gonna have made
voting for him worth it for me I'm
standing behind Donald Trump because of
his conservative values you know having
the faith-based community with him is
very important to the Latino community
so yes I am voting Republican and I did
not register ever until 2015 is that
right so yeah you had never voted
until this a presidential no I felt that
you know our faith-based community
needed support and what was it about
President Trump that made you think that
he had those Christian values he was
actually talking to faith-based
communities for me for the midterm my
message is more to Democrats than
Republicans my local elected officials
are the reason for and have are the
reason for the deterioration of our
community
it is Democrat decision making that has
widened the divide between the haves and
the have-nots your basic sending a
message to your local exactly because
the local politics are why I am
Republican today the latest poll numbers
show that only 36 percent of the country
approves of the job that he's doing with
women it's lower only 29 percent of
women approved 65 percent disapprove why
do you think that is Ally
well it starts with talking about
women's face lifts I think it's it's
disrespectful I think the majority of
women I don't think that they see him as
a respectful Pro woman kind of man
especially people my age in my age
demographic it's a huge deal that he's
not supportive of easily accessible
women's health care um in terms of
planned parenthood they feel like
they're losing the right to birth
control pap smears abortions so Ali
you're not happy that you voted is it
fair is that fair characterization yeah
yeah I part of the reason I voted for
him was because I thought he was gonna
be the one of the two candidates to make
our national security a high priority
and make us safer on our own grounds in
our own territory but when you're making
fun of foreign leaders and being coming
buddy-buddy with Vladimir Putin it it
shakes me up a little bit my fear with
President Trump is that his extra
marital affairs will make it more of a
norm that the children will think this
is acceptable behavior and it's not it's
hurtful behavior the whole stormy
Daniels thing I don't agree obviously
well with what has gone on in the past
if I could only vote for a candidate who
has been perfect his or her entire life
I could only vote for Jesus Christ well
yeah that was hard to watch all of that
was hard to watch if you could only vote
for a perfect candidate you could only
vote for Jesus Christ you know I think
that there's quite a gap between a guy
like Donald Trump and your perception of
the perfect man / God Jesus Christ if
you wanted to get as close to that
philosophy as you could you know the
philosophy of a kind loving open-hearted
person who cares about people and cares
about the poor and wants to give
everybody health care and better wages
and stuff Bernie Sanders was probably
your bet
but no what a stupid excuse for voting
for Trump Hey look like a vote for
perfect like only person I could vote
for is Jesus so instead you went with
the guy who said we have to take out
their families talking about killing
civilians on purpose which would be the
definition of terrorism you went with
the guy who you know was caught talking
about I grabbed him by the [ __ ] I don't
even wait wait for what that would mean
consent I don't wait for consent I just
grabbed him by the [ __ ] doesn't
sound very Jesus like to me doesn't
sound very Jesus like when he said wages
are too high as he did in one of the
debates so I'm just saying okay so that
was this one of the silliest parts let's
go through it because some of them I'm
slightly sympathetic to some of the
points that some of them made but to
most of it I'm not at all sympathetic so
one of the ones I'm sympathetic towards
is she said well look I want to change
so she said I voted for Obama and I
guess apparently under Obama her life
didn't get necessarily better her
economic situation whatever may be so I
want to change okay I get that and I
think that that's one of the one of the
driving reasons why a lot of people
voted for Trump is they think oh he's
gonna shake stuff up and really bring
change and make it he's not gonna listen
to the establishment look at him he's
off he's off his rocker
but that could actually have some
positive effects so I actually
sympathize with at all it's change okay
fair enough but then she goes on to say
when I asked oh how you gonna vote now
she says omen vote Republicans in the in
the midterms what well you didn't get
the change that you thought you wanted
and now you say oh I'm gonna double down
on not getting that change by voting
Republican again but then she goes on to
say well look I trust the economic
situation that we're in so in other
words Trump's endless marketing about
his economy has worked on her and she
thinks like oh yeah the economy's doing
fantastic but that's just not true
wages are still stagnant they've been
that way since the 1980s half a working
people in this country make thirty
thousand dollars a year or less seventy
six percent of Americans are living
paycheck to paycheck twenty nine million
Americans don't have health insurance we
are in a giant bubble the tax cuts
overwhelmingly went to the rich 83% of
the benefits went to the top one percent
it was a giant corporate tax cut the
stock market is soaring because there
were a lot of stock buybacks as a result
of the tax cut for the rich so it is all
a house of cards and apparently she
doesn't know that and Trump's marketing
has worked on her then somebody said oh
I voted for Donald Trump because of my
faith
okay that's sad that's sad I don't know
what else to say about that because I
honestly don't even know what that means
because as we've spoken about on this
show before you can drop that excuse out
under any circumstance like I just said
you could look at somebody who's a very
kind hearted open-hearted politician who
means well who does good things like
Bernie Sanders and you say well he's the
most christ-like so I voted for him
because I'm a Christian somebody could
say that okay that would make sense but
then you also have people who are
Republicans you know people like Mike
Huckabee and and Rick Santorum and their
right-wing fundamentalist Christians who
go oh that I support them because of my
faith so you could use your faith to
back up any [ __ ] political ideology
you want so it's almost like you're just
super imposing your own political
beliefs onto your faith and saying God
agrees with me on all these things and
then you're rationalizing it and that's
what that is I voted for Trump because
of my faith I mean listen other people
have pointed this out I don't know the
reality of the situation but let's just
say it's likely that his he's doing a
tap-dance
you know like oh yes I am so religious
really Donald Trump is super religious
he just strikes me as a super
narcissistic and selfish dude and the
fact that you can't see through that
means I question your judgment so all he
had to do is go out there and make mouth
noises in favor of you and your
community and and that's it you decide
it all he's my man and I'll vote for him
how silly is that I mean that really
does not speak well of your intelligence
if all he has to do is go out there and
say you know Christians unbelievable
people tremendous people let me tell you
and you're like oh I must vote for him
like what the [ __ ] is that it's like
when he said to 2corinthians over here
remember that is they are there 2
Corinthians 2 Corinthians walk into a
bar oh it's so sad then we get somebody
saying well you know hey I wanted to
support him for national security and
safety I don't know what that means but
my guess is what you're saying is I like
the fact that he was talking about
bringing back torture that's my guess
maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm being unfair
but when you say oh I supported him for
national security in
safety my guess is you like the we're
gonna do we're gonna do a total and
complete shutdown of Muslims into the
United States my guess is you like that
my guess is you like the wall rhetoric
my guess is you like the torture [ __ ]
that that's my guess when you say oh I
voted for him for national security and
safety but then she throws a twist at
you and says oh but I don't I I think
I'm not gonna vote in that direction
again because it's really scary to me
that he's buddies with Vladimir Putin
well that's a silly statement in my
opinion in the other direction because I
would rather have even with kim
jeong-hoon who's a monster I would
rather have our government have a
positive relationship with these people
so that we avoid war so that it you know
the more Vladimir Putin
excuse me the more Trump and Kim Jong
hoon suck each other off on on Twitter
well actually kim jeong-hoon doesn't
have twitter so we can't do that but the
more of a positive relationship they
have where they give each other
compliments the better for everybody
except means we're not going to war
honestly same thing with Vladimir Putin
I know people oh my god it's a collusion
in Russia I'm blah blah blah blah I
don't want to go to war I don't want to
have World War 3 I know people who might
not be well-versed on the geopolitical
situation think that wasn't gonna happen
anyway I don't know about that look at
Crimea in the situation that happened in
Crimea look at the escalation on
Russia's border with NATO troops all
this stuff is serious with our fighter
jets in and our ships in the Black Sea
right on Russia's border that's all
serious I'd rather have a line of
communication open there so to be all
he's too buddy-buddy with Latimer Putin
if he's if they're an [ __ ] if they're
[ __ ] to each other that puts us on a
in a much scarier situation and then
finally one of them said oh you know my
problem with him is the extramarital
affair and I think that you know kids'll
might start to think that's normal and
that's not okay listen Trump's an
[ __ ] I got it you got it it's the
clearest thing in the world did he have
an extramarital affair or multiple
extramarital affair affairs yes there's
so much evidence there whether stormy
Daniels or Karen McDougal which was
actually a relationship stormy Daniels
was more of like a one-night stand where
he promised oh you get on the apprentice
and then he didn't fall
through with Karen McDougal it was like
a relationship so is he an [ __ ] and
did he have these extramarital affairs
yes does that impact his ability to do
his job no it just doesn't it just
doesn't so in other words if Bernie
Sanders was president and come to find
out and not to not to besmirch his name
cuz this probably is not true but I'll
throw it out there anyway if we
hypothetically learn Bernie was cheating
on his wife but he's president that
doesn't mean medicare-for-all is any
less valid that doesn't mean $15 minimum
wage is any less valid that doesn't mean
free college is any less valid I mean
I'm just saying that's the reality of
the situation so and then she says oh
well my problem with that is the kids
will think it's normal I guarantee you
children are wholly unconcerned with
what Donald Trump is doing with his
little orange mushroom so really just be
honest that's you saying oh I don't like
it because I don't like it and that's
fine but just admit that that is you
okay so you got nothing do with the kids
kids don't know about that there are
other reasons I'm concerned about kids
watching seeing what Trump happened to
do whether it's the endless wars or
whatever it might be but the extra
mounter marital affair that just exposes
what we already knew he was anyway which
is a [ __ ] scumbag so a personal
scumbag so yeah overall that segment was
kind of hard to watch because you don't
they're just not very good reasons in
either direction even the people who are
like oh I'm not gonna support him again
even their reasons were not good reasons
even when I agree with them on the
outcome you know I used to say on your
tests like Oh show your work when they
show their work their work is dead wrong
even though they got to the right
conclusion that's what I saw there and
then never mind all the people who are
like I know I'm still gonna I still
support them let's just say in summation
those are shitty reasons across the
board
hello everybody I'll let you boy
I know it's early it it's early for me
too
got a lot of stuff to talk about today I
wanted to do a secular talk secular
talking smack live stream I haven't done
one of these in a while um goddamn I
woke up today in my right eye it looks
like I have pinkeye or something and I'm
looking at it now in the live stream
holy [ __ ] does that look bad Wow I mean
look at that Jesus that's why I'm
wearing my glasses because my contacts
you know sometimes I get I get a little
too ambitious with my contacts I uh I
wear the night and day ones and what
happens is I I go I go nuts I'll wear my
night-and-day contacts for like
sometimes two months straight and it
never really bothers my eyes I know some
people like cor and he wears contacts
from time to time and for him like he
has to take him out every night and if
he doesn't take him out every night
he'll like wake up from a nap or
something or from one night sleep and
his eyes will be black really red and
they'll be in pain for me I get the
night and day ones and I could just
sleep even if I didn't have the night
and day once back when I had the ones
you're supposed to take out every night
I would still sleep with them for like a
week or two weeks and I'd be fine
I feel no problem with it at all I
wouldn't be in pain that my eyes
wouldn't be read this I don't think this
is because of the contacts I think it's
actually because of maybe pinkeye
maybe I got pinkeye it looks like
pinkeye and it's like watery and stuff
it's gross its disgusting
but anyway on that lovely note to start
like I said there's a bunch of stuff
that I want to get to I'll take some
super chats a little bit later so if you
just popped into this live stream you
could hold off on the super chats for
now because if you send a super chat now
I'm not really gonna see it I'll
announce when I'm ready to start taking
some some super chats let me get into
the live control
so I put in the title some of the stuff
that I wanted to talk about oh the
political debate I'm so terrible at um
promoting [ __ ] that involves me I really
I'm the worst
but I'm trying to I'm trying to get
better at it and I'm trying to talk
about it more often like i retweeted my
announcement that i'm going to be at
politican yesterday and there were
people who were like oh [ __ ] you're
gonna be a politican and then that's
just a reminder to me that's like oh
just cuz i said it once doesn't mean
that everybody caught on to it that
first time in fact it's probably the
exact opposite is true people had no
idea most people probably had no idea
and unless you saw that one particular
video of me discussing it then you
wouldn't know so I try to remind myself
to talk about this stuff more often I'm
gonna be debating Ann Coulter at
politican it should be fun I'm starting
to get more of the details now a lot of
people have been asking me okay what
what day are you gonna do it and and do
you know what time and all that stuff I
do not know the time I know that as of
right now it's supposed to be I think on
Saturday that I debate and Coulter now
I'm also gonna be for the other days I
will also be involved in other ways and
politic on I think I'm gonna be I have
the one debate with Ann Coulter then I
have I think two more panels that I'm
supposed to be on and I'm not the
details are still being ironed out for
for the panel's but my understanding is
that at least one of the panel's the
conversation is going to be what should
the Democratic Party do moving forwards
like reforming the Democratic Party and
how we move forward from here and you
know I
some people would frame it as repairing
the Democratic Party bringing back unity
after what happened in the 2016 election
you know I don't even know if that's
necessarily a good thing to be unified
if you're unifying with a you know one
half
of the picture and that half is just
corrupt I don't want to unify with
corrupt people so it'll it should be an
interesting discussion I know I'm gonna
be there we're gonna have Anna kasparian
from TYT is gonna be there I think she's
supposed to be on one of the panels with
me David Pakman will be there Sam cedar
these are people whose names I've seen
floated as to potentially be in on
certain panels with me so there's a lot
of stuff to look forward to I'm
certainly looking forward to it
I know that the probably the debate is
the thing that's gonna get most of most
of the attention at least in terms of
the stuff that I'll be involved in but
honestly I think even the panel
discussion should be interesting
so I left the tickets in the description
to the live stream if you wanna you know
join us please I want to pack that place
full of secular talk listeners and that
will certainly make me feel more to use
that's for damn sure
and yeah we'll be able to interact and
have some fun and again I think the Ann
Coulter debate is supposed to be on that
Saturday so because you know it's like a
two-day thing so people were asking hey
which which one should I get I go in two
days is a little excessive you know I
think the N Coulter one Saturday but the
thing is like I said all the details are
still being ironed out so I'm not even
sure if that's gonna maintain maybe that
all change and if it does change
obviously I'll tell you guys and I'll
update you on that but I thought hey
it's probably good idea if I let
everybody know that I'm gonna be a
polite akan because so far I've only
mentioned it like two times so I should
probably continue to do that and try to
do that almost every show from now until
Politico and I probably be a good idea
so get some tickets and we'll have some
fun it's in LA it's actually a good
segue talking about the Democratic Party
and how that might be one of the panels
to the first topic should I dive into
what do I put in the title of video did
I put Ted Cruz first or did I put
Hillary Clinton first I don't even know
I'll talk about whichever one I put
first Ted Cruz
I put me
truths people are debating which which
impression is better my Ted Cruz
impression or my Pat Robertson here I'll
do my Pat Robertson that's my Pat
Robertson my Ted Cruz just involves the
word me that's my whole Ted Cruz
impression I'm take with me so Ted Cruz
is in serious trouble and I think I
think he realizes that because now he's
sending out fake summons to to try to
get money to try to raise campaign funds
and listen that's a sign that he's in
trouble and he knows he's in trouble
because he's pulling out all these
sleazy dirty tricks and remember we've
done some segments recently where Ted
Cruz is just his ads are like comically
bad I mean really but there's one ad
where like the whole thing is like I
stand for the anthem me it's like it's
right-wing virtue signaling that's what
he's doing he's doing virtue signaling
to the right I like the anthem and I
enjoy America I think America is good me
so he did that and I always whenever I
think about Ted Cruz now I think about
the video of him during the election
where he's sitting next to his uh his
mom and he's trying to you know make it
seem like he's got the perfect Leave It
to Beaver family and because he feels
like that's what he needs to portray in
order to win and he's like you know my
mother she prays for me every day four
hours a day and his mom is like
what he's so bad he's so awkward and
then what was the other one that he did
recent oh he went after bait O'Rourke
for cursing there was an ant Ted Cruz ad
that went after beta O'Rourke for
cursing and it's like hey dude and were
one you support Donald Trump and he
curses more than any politician number
two you're making him look like a badass
and this is the same thing I said when
Republicans ran an ad back here in the
primary when they were going after Trump
for cursing
I said you're doing his work for him
because you're making oh he's a rough
around the edges he's not like the other
fake politicians that's how you're
that's what the message people are gonna
take away from that and if you do the
same thing for beta O'Rourke you're
helping him and also you're blowing up
this myth of like but you know you
portray left eases the stereotypical you
know in their feelings and mushy and
snowflakes and then now what you're
doing is you're saying oh he's not that
he's he's like a cool dude who's not
afraid to break convention so he's so
bad but the fact that you have to send
out like I'm not sure that might even be
illegal so as a campaign you're gonna
send out fundraising appeals and it's
gonna have some ins on it you can't
impersonate a summons that's crazy
you shouldn't be allowed to do I don't I
don't honestly they might not be allowed
to do that that may be a violation of
the law so again I think that shows that
he's in trouble
and he knows he's in trouble and boy is
that amazing I mean we're talking about
Texas and it's supposed to be like a
layup election for Ted Cruz but he's
just such a bad politician that it's not
and you know I actually I have many
issues with how bado is running his
campaign but um as I've said before I
think he might even be able to pull it
off because Ted is so bad so even though
I think bado is running a flawed
campaign that might not even matter
because he's better than Ted Cruz so
it'll be interesting to see what happens
Ben I'm very interested to see what
happens in that race um but I will say
this if if bado happens to lose that's
what I'm gonna remind if
of all the things that I thought he did
wrong I already mentioned it in one in
one segment we don't need to get into it
now but I'll just say that if he doesn't
win it'll be because he wasn't populist
enough again he might pull it out
because apparently he's going all over
Texas and he's he's really like I think
he's been to every county in Texas so
he's really like putting in the legwork
which is great which I support so he
might pull it out for that reason and
because Ted Cruz is Ted Cruz me and he's
so terrible but if he doesn't pull it
out I'll think it's because he wasn't
populist enough and honestly I think
that was a little bit of what happened
with Cynthia Nixon well we won't talk
about that now I'm sure you guys might
have some questions about that and which
I'll be happy to answer when we get to
the Super chats but I think that was one
of the things with Cynthia okay Hillary
Clinton so this you know I was thinking
okay maybe I'll save it for a regular
show but now I'll just talk about it now
because I really don't want to give her
any more official attention on the
regular show we'll do it in a secular
talking smack
she got downgraded now she's in the
secular talking's it's like the kids
table debate remember the kids table
debate you're in the Republican primary
where they had all the shittier
candidates they had like [ __ ] Bobby
Jindal and Lindsey Graham debate each
other like earlier as what Hillary
Clinton's been downgraded so now we're
talking about her here and not on the
regular show but she tweeted something
she did this long tweet storm ago my god
Donald Trump was terrible Wow fresh
material you got there Hillary and
here's one of the things she said that
really blew up on lefty Twitter she said
Donald Trump refuses to be subject to
the law the legitimacy of our elections
is in doubt okay let's pause right there
that's only half the tweet but let's
pause right there the legitimacy of our
elections is in doubt almost like the
legitimacy of the 2016 Democratic
primary was in doubt because of you and
Debbie wasserman-schultz
and the DNC and your agreement with them
where they were basically in
arm of the Hillary Clinton campaign and
you know how WikiLeaks proved that you
guys fundamentally rigged the primary
against Bernie Sanders who was the
candidate who could have beaten Donald
Trump you mean that kind of endowed
Hillary the kind of in doubt where you
rigged a primary and then screw over the
country and screw over the Democratic
Party from getting the proper nominee
who can beat Donald Trump you mean that
kind of in doubt is that the kind of in
doubt you're talking about you mean the
kind of in doubt we're donna Brazile
sneaks you questions to a debate before
the debate actually happens that kind of
in doubt you mean the the voting times
in pro bernie districts being fiddled
with you mean that kind of in doubt you
mean the kind of in doubt where you hide
debates on purpose in order to try to
maintain your lead and run out the clock
you mean that kind of in doubt is that
the kind of in doubt you mean our
elections are in doubt is that the kind
of in doubt i mean that's her hypocrisy
is the thing I can't get over but it
gets worse she says the administration
is undermining the national unity that
makes democracy possible okay I'll pause
again that's not the whole tweet but
I'll pause again this is the same kind
of mealy-mouthed corporate democrat
[ __ ] that doesn't appeal to anybody
I care about national down today right
what does that mean what does that mean
it means oh I want Democrats and
Republicans to hold hands and sing
Kumbaya and act like everything is great
and we love each other that's not an a
winning message I mean Adam Johnson
affair says it best he says nobody
nobody shows up to a pep rally to root
for a tie and when that's what you're
talking about national unity that's what
you're doing like why can't we all just
get along and hold hands why don't [ __ ]
would you want to get along with people
who want to wage endless war and want to
take health care away from everybody and
who are speeding up the next crash by
deregulating and cutting taxes for the
rich why don't you want to get along
with them I don't want a tional unity
with those people the elected
Republicans I don't want that so that's
[ __ ] mealy-mouthed corporate
democrat nonsense and then here's the
line that is really the cherry on top
and it's the worst part and then there's
the breathtaking corruption Hillary
Clinton says of Donald Trump now let me
be crystal clear for those of you who
try to take this out of context is
Donald Trump corrupt
you bet your ass cheeks he's corrupt
it's not even a question I mean it they
have in emoluments case against him that
has proceeded through two court's so
emoluments means he's taking money from
foreign governments and that that is the
Constitution doesn't allow that because
then you have a president who's
compromised who will do the bidding of
the governments that are paying him
money and he has there's legitimacy to
the emoluments case nevermind the
private donations and doing the bidding
of Wall Street packing his
administration full of goldman sachs and
so on and so forth he is insanely
corrupt
however hillary clinton is - you do not
get to say talk about breathtaking
corruption when it was the clinton
foundation that was directly involved in
the looting of Haiti after the
earthquake you don't get to talk about
corruption when it's the Clinton
Foundation that has a thousand
corruption scandals with legitimacy
don't take my word for it
David Sirota of the International
Business Times wrote an amazing article
that details all of the corruption
scandals with the Clinton Foundation in
particular and it is mind-boggling it's
an endless list of corruption scandals
and most importantly you don't get to
talk about corruption when Hillary and
Bill together for their respective
careers you know how much money they
raise from private donors and it's for
all of their endeavors for their for
their respective campaigns for the
Clinton Foundation for everything put
together three billion dollars now if
you tell me they raise three billion
dollars in private donations and they
did not turn around and do favors for
the big-money interests that gave them
that money I'm gonna tell you to go [ __ ]
yourself and you're being willfully
blind to the reality of the situation
and look it's reflected in the voting
record again don't take my word for it
why do you think Hillary Clinton has to
say like she did in the debate before
the crash on Wall Street I went down
there and I told them you guys better
cut it out cut it out why did she say
that because she had nothing stronger to
say to point to her record because she
she was in favor of the deregulation of
Wall Street so now it's oh sure my
policies role on the
side but I went down there and told him
and wag my finger and said you better
cut it out see corporate Democrats are
the downfall of the Democratic Party and
whenever Hillary Clinton goes out there
and she tries to lead this charge
against Donald Trump all its gonna do is
set us back because now instead of
having the conversation that we should
be having what we're doing is we have to
pick apart Hillary Clinton in our own
side because of the breathtaking
hypocrisy and the breathtaking
corruption that we have to deal with and
she even had the nerve to go on and say
here I'll read this one for you David
Sirota on Twitter pointed this out
Hillary goes there is a tendency when
talking about these things to wring our
hands about both sides but the truth is
that this is not a symmetrical problem
when it comes to the issue of corruption
you bet your ass it's a symmetrical
problem it's not a symmetrical problem
when it comes to say social issues
Republicans are just flat-out worse you
can point to maybe six or seven
different issues where it is not a
symmetrical problem and the Republicans
are just way way WAY WAY worse but when
it comes to buying into the premise of
we're gonna take corporate money we're
gonna take billionaire money yeah it is
a symmetrical problem it 100% is a
symmetrical problem and she is the queen
of corruption so for her to say that is
like here's what that means
she knows she's being a hypocrite and so
she has to go above and beyond to try to
hide her hypocrisy and then also what
David Schroeder puts next to that which
really just proves his point and proves
Hilary dead wrong is that at the same
time she was tweeting this you know what
was going on the Senate voted ninety
three to seven to approve a six hundred
and seven billion dollar military budget
which is a seventeen billion dollar
increase and it's the biggest military
budget outside of the height of the Iraq
war and you know who the no votes were I
hope you're sitting down Paul to me SAS
Lee flake Perdue and Bernie Sanders so
in other words six of the no votes on
the giant increase in military spending
we're Republicans the only person who's
on the left who was against it Bernie
Sanders so when Hillary says oh this
isn't a this isn't a symmetrical problem
they're the problem every single
Democrat in the Senate voted to give
thin-skinned lunatic maniac crazy person
Donald Trump a six hundred and seven
hello everybody what's up
how y'all doing welcome to another show
dude i was uh i was excited for today
because
and i was texting you about this like
two or three days ago yeah i really
wanted to talk about
mgk versus eminem yeah and and
usually like i would say the rap game
now
is just totally not my realm like i'm
i'm just like
there's a radio station out by me 104.3
shout out like they were like new
sort of recently and they just played
bangers but it was bangers from like
1999's type of [ __ ] like 2000.
so it's not the rock station that we
have here where it's q1043. you're
talking about a totally different q104
yeah probably okay because if they're
playing 90 [ __ ] that's not the cue 104
that we have around here here q104
is like a straight rock classic rock
[ __ ]
and i know you're not that's not our
[ __ ] classic
i mean occasionally we could get down on
some smashing pumpkins or like
you know like something like classic
rock classic rock is like [ __ ]
rolling stones pink floyd that gold's
[ __ ]
don't get me wrong some of those some of
those like i appreciate music if they
make a banger
yeah i'm gonna for me it's a single song
like they could there could be a single
song from one of them where i'm like oh
this is kind of hot
but it's never like the genre itself is
way behind in my mind
because that's not so for me and this is
a good way to start this conversation
too
about um the the beef the rappy
so for me it goes like r b is probably
number one on my list of [ __ ] i like
and then i'd say it's a tie between rap
and pop
you know what i mean so it's like that
that's how i'd rank it and then
everything is kind of significantly
then i probably get like 90s alternative
rock is right underneath that
and then underneath that is like
everything's tied because i don't
i just can't appreciate all everything
because it wasn't the generation i grew
up with and all that stuff
so so i've been out of the rap game too
like i haven't been
following it a lot well to pre what's it
to preface it to preface this
um there's too many [ __ ] rappers now
like the reason i don't follow this [ __ ]
is because one i'm
i'm not interested all i want to do is
just put on like the radio
and hear some [ __ ] i don't care about
beef i don't care about
nicki minaj versus cardi b i don't care
about any of the [ __ ] because i got
enough [ __ ] in my life
that i don't care about little dick face
fighting little [ __ ] vagina face
there could actually be a rapper at some
point in the future named little dick
face
well yeah there definitely is somebody
out there right now like yo they just
shouted me out
like little dick face i'm right here
so that's so i hate all that beef [ __ ] i
hate all the like
fighting because these guys are
millionaires there's real [ __ ]
problems there's real [ __ ] going on and
that [ __ ]
is just annoying it's like some
kardashian [ __ ] for me so i have so
i have a different perspective god
finish what you're gonna say no no so i
was gonna get into the beef but what's
what's your take on it you're like
no so i have a different perspective so
like i'm not even
i wouldn't even describe myself as a big
music guy like i think i'm not even a
big music guy it never
i mean it speaks to me a little bit i
disagree with that i think
i think you like music because we used
to have times where we would put [ __ ] on
in the car and really just [ __ ] jam
the [ __ ] out
that's true but number one that's the
only time i ever like every time i've
ever really jammed out to music i think
you were probably there
whether it's us doing karaoke or just
chilling
in in the car or whatever like yeah so i
guess it's what qualifies it because i
would say i'm sort of the same
but i've never i've been to one concert
in my life it's not like i'm actively
pursuing going to concerts yeah so
i i would say then on the scale wherever
you are
on that appreciation of music scale i
think i'm a little bit below you
because i like i'm not even big on
like i will now actively choose if i'm
driving i have siriusxm in the car when
i'm driving i'll
throw on like pga tour radio or some
talk [ __ ]
and that takes precedence over music now
like i'd say maybe
20 of the rides i'll throw on some music
so that's and i'm not the type of person
i know people who like need to listen to
music every day
right now i could easily go three or
four days five days without listening to
any music
and it's just not it was never the thing
that that speaks to me like it doesn't
speak to me but
you know you're right that maybe i'm
overstating it because yeah if i'm
if i'm in the right mood and all that
and then i get hit with the right song
at the right time sure but i think
that's anybody really
yeah you're working out and you need
some music or some [ __ ] but especially
when it comes to rap
i've been really not paying that much
attention to rap
you know we're the era of jadakiss
fabulous
um eminem when he started g-unit around
that
yeah yeah so that we were we had master
p
we had juvenile dmx yeah yeah lil wayne
old school
old school little wayne yeah boys yeah
like we knew
lil wayne [ __ ] before lil wayne was
little wayne when nobody else knew him
when he was before he had a tattoo
wrapping the block is hot and [ __ ]
yeah so so yeah
so i have been kind of out of the music
[ __ ] for a while and
now i think it was the beef thing that
actually pulled me back in a little bit
because i needed something other than
just the music
to make me care or pay attention at all
and so
i saw i stumbled across this from um
on twitter i saw the trending topics and
i think one day it was eminem and one
day it said machine gun kelly
now this is how much i've been out of
the music game i didn't even know who
the [ __ ] machine gun kelly was
neither i've heard the name never saw
him i guess i'd heard the name maybe
once or twice but i'd never [ __ ]
saw him you could have showed me him i'd
have been like who the [ __ ] is that i
don't know who the [ __ ] that is
yep so anyway for people who are also in
my boat and they're not music people let
me break down for you what happened
eminem so and this kid machine gun kelly
who's 28 years old and he's a rapper
he's a white rapper
and there's not that many of those
so he and automatically when you think
white rapper everybody just
eminem is a statement yeah yeah yeah so
he tweeted in like 2012
he tweeted um no disrespect to eminem
because he's the goat but
uh his daughter haley's fine as [ __ ]
so eminem saw that and he was pissed
about it but apparently he he didn't
actually see it until like a year after
it but when he saw it he was pissed
about it
but then and eminem i guess is the owner
of shade 45 the sirius xm radio station
so he said to to sway who hosts a show
there
don't allow this kid mgk on because [ __ ]
him because of what he said about
haley my daughter or whatever yeah and
then so
mgk does all these interviews and [ __ ]
and and he makes like a very
like he keeps repeating over and over
that like oh [ __ ] eminem he's my
favorite bapper until he it rapper until
he ban me from shade 45
yeah like he just keeps bringing it up
over and over this this got resurfaced
because
eminem randomly dropped a cd and that's
the next part of it
okay is eminem randomly dropped a a cd
a cd it's not cd it's an album cd we're
from the 90s son that's
old as [ __ ] we're so old but best we saw
best buy
start selling singles and cds and then
just recently they said they're not
selling cds anymore
we saw the whole life cycle of [ __ ]
cds
like we saw something we used to make
them and then [ __ ] die
we used to make cds you could burn it on
to the ship
yeah cause kazam and napster and kazam
and naps are exactly
on top of the [ __ ] and limewire
remember limewire
all that [ __ ] so anyway uh he he
he dr eminem dropped a new album and
said in it
like mentioned mgk or whatever so mgk
goes
and like i guess disses him or whatever
so mgk goes
bet and it's almost like people were
pointing this out it's almost like
he had already made that [ __ ] and he was
just waiting for an opportunity
to tell this [ __ ] was years later it was
like 12 years later or some [ __ ]
exactly so it i mean no not 12 years or
2012
and now it's 2018 so do the whole time
so six years later
but it is a while that's a long time oh
yeah so anyway machine gun kelly does an
uh a whole eminem song and when i say a
song
like he did a diss track like a diss
track i've never even heard before
because usually diss tracks don't have
a [ __ ] chorus like this [ __ ] had a
hook this is part of my argument
as to i'll tell you who i side with me
okay
so so i saw that [ __ ] trending i i guess
i i looked it up and i was like oh [ __ ]
because it was it's well known you don't
need to know that much about rap to know
that there's a general rule for
everybody in the rap game
which is don't go at eminem because he's
gonna [ __ ] you up
because he's known as like one of the
best battle rappers of all time like
yeah and i think a lot of that comes
from obviously eight mile
you know and it's like not just that
because you know he he
buried [ __ ] ja rule he buried benzino
he buried like a bunch of people
and like they were the game was talking
about this the game was like when i was
beefing with 50
i may i went out of my way to not
mention eminem because
i knew everybody knows in the rap game
don't mess with the white boy
leave the white boy alone leave the
white boy along he's gonna [ __ ] you up
so so anyway this kid
goes after eminem and coming to find out
yeah he's he's
famous but he's not that famous machine
gun kelly no
yeah he's not that famous no so
everybody's like yo
what are you doing like you can't like
that's crazy why'd you do that
anyway cut to i listened to his [ __ ]
i was expecting to be like this [ __ ] is
buns i was like
i mean because he's got some valid
points like so he to your point he makes
more of a song which
in a battle if you're going at somebody
you you just either do a freestyle
or you drop some track that is like
doesn't have catchy beats to it or some
[ __ ] like that
so he came out with a song that was sort
of catchy hell yeah it was catchy it was
super catchy
it was catchy so my problem with it was
it was a little long
i think he went a little long with it
and
you don't make a song you don't make a
catchy song when you're trying to get it
somewhere oh so you didn't like that i
thought you're gonna say you like that
about it no i mean i like the song i
like i liked it but as a strategy you
didn't like
that no because i see that more as like
he's going against what we what
he wants people to think you know like
so he wants people to think i'm not
doing this for the attention i'm not
doing this because it's eminem and i
need to get famous
so basically he comes out with a song
and you know
is now promoting that as like this is my
song that i'm gonna sing at concerts and
[ __ ] like that
and basically says in the song yeah i am
broke
and i don't have as much money as with
like as you but
i'm still gonna come at you you know so
it's like i wasn't a fan of that like
out
if he's gonna come at eminem just hit
him with some [ __ ] say it once and
that's it don't start
singing it at concerts don't start you
know bumping that [ __ ]
because that's not well yeah that's
risky that's risky like oh i'm gonna do
it at a concert
like because it's backfiring on him i
just saw right just saw too that he got
booted off stage when he tried to do it
at a concert
and also he did some grimy [ __ ] where he
he's opening for fallout boy so people
in the audience are fall out boy
fans and then what he did is he he was
wearing a hoodie
he took off his hoodie turned around and
told his boy to take a picture of him in
the audience and he told the audience
put your middle fingers up
and when he took off his hoodie the
audience didn't even see but he had the
picture of the of eminem's
response to him the kill shot album [ __ ]
picture it on him
going like this and everyone the
audience giving the [ __ ] you too
but he didn't even tell the audience
like the audience didn't even know he
was wearing that shirt
so he made it seem like these are all my
fans and they're all with me but it's
like son those are fall out boy fans
yeah yeah so so anyway now let me get
into
i want to give the lines that i liked
okay
so we'll start with machine gun kelly
because again i was expecting it to be
kind of whack but i listened to it i was
like damn he did have some like really
good
lines in there yeah so the the first
really great line it started out cheesy
as [ __ ] i thought because he starts out
with um
uh somebody get him some clippers his
[ __ ] beard's weird
like yeah you talk about like it's not
even
like that's child that's petty it
doesn't even in a rap battle and i know
you get
extra leeway like you can be petty in a
d in a diss track but that's so petty
that it was like
yeah don't lead with that [ __ ] true um
but the the first really good line was i
know you can't stand yourself
trying to be the old you so bad you
stand yourself
so hit him with this eminem song stan
like he's saying
you're standing yourself because you're
trying to be the old you so i was like
that's a good line but also another
point is
people don't think he wrote that [ __ ]
people think
he had writers for that really yeah
that's like something going around i
don't know
when eminem mentioned that that he was
talking about
drake that he was getting a drake when
he said that oh no i heard that he had
like two writers for this
for his like rap [ __ ] well that's funny
because it's not even
like i was going to say i was going to
make this point about machine gun kelly
there's some people probably listening
like who the [ __ ] is machine gun
well i didn't know i thought this [ __ ]
was interesting that's why i'm talking
about it no it is
it is and that's why i looked into it
also but
yeah so i thought that the writing
wasn't even that good it was almost
too straightforward like there are some
good lines in there but it's almost too
straightforward
but that's what got eminem his claim to
fame because you remember when like
mariah carey tried to call
him out on this [ __ ] i do remember
like because they had sex and supposedly
he came real quick but eminem's a
wordsmith son like he knows how to
like eminem will always wrap some [ __ ]
and then he'll hit you with like
there's like two or three meanings to
the [ __ ] he said which is what makes it
so clever
whereas machine gun kelly there's not a
hint of that it's just all
yeah like your beard is weird yeah and
then okay another good line he said
yeah yeah i'll acknowledge you're the
goat but i'm the gunner [ __ ] i got you
in the scope
so it's like okay you're the goat you're
the greatest of all time but i'm a
hunter
and i got you in my scope it's like
that's a good line i like that line
um yeah but you're still throwing the
dude a compliment like it's okay so
that's another thing i was gonna do
people were getting adam over that and
saying like oh yo you can't compliment
him at the same time
that you're doing a diss track but i
don't actually agree with that because
you ha he's acknowledging listen i'm
coming at one of the greatest rappers of
all time
so you can't pretend like you're not
doing that because if he pretended like
he wasn't doing that people would have
been like
yo why are you not even acknowledging
you're going to eminem
that's true that's a good point yeah so
he he he was like okay i'm going to give
you your props where you deserve it but
i'm going to come after you where i
think you're wrong
so i think that was a good idea but
you're right that eminem flipped that
back on him
yeah he flipped that right back on him
and almost was like
he said in his song did you just diss me
on perplexed
you know but he's like yeah you gave me
a compliment or whatever and then
like compliment me on the next something
like that yeah yeah
Jake Tapper decided to go after the left
and he's gonna use some recent recent
election results in New York to make
that point and he's going to give a very
pointed line of questioning here to
Alexandria Ocasio Cortez but before we
dive into the clip let me just tell
everybody exactly what happened in the
New York election so you did have three
big losses for the left that is fair to
say Cynthia Nixon lost to Andrew Cuomo
you had
Jumaane Williams lose you had Zephyr
Teachout lose now there is a genuine
question about a a purposeful attempt at
vote splitting when it came to his
effort each out which then turned it
over to the more establishment candidate
but you know I digress we don't need to
dive into the details of that at the
moment there are allegations of you know
some voter [ __ ] going on in New York
as there's almost always is the case in
New York I mean you know I'm a New
Yorker and every election there's talk
of that and I've even seen some of the
firsthand in the 2016 primary when an
independent was turned away he was a kid
who was there to vote for Bernie Sanders
and sorry you're not registered as a
Democrat and the Democratic primary
we're gonna turn you away and this is
the effect of having closed primaries
but there's other kinds of [ __ ] too
it was widely reported but again I
digress from that we don't need to dive
into it now Jake Tapper is gonna miss
half the picture here though because
while it is true there were three big
Democratic losses there were also about
five big Democratic wins
and when I say democratic I mean
left-wing populist left wins so I'll
give you more on that after the clip
it'll be touched on in this clip as well
but let's take a look and then I have a
lot to say about tappers line of
questioning you endorsed progressive
candidate Cynthia Nixon and the
Democratic primary for governor of New
York she lost on Thursday to Governor
Andrew Cuomo by a whopping 31 points now
I know progressive candidates have had
plenty of other victories including
yours but Governor Cuomo said that your
progressive wave was quote not even a
ripple he called your primary win a
quote fluke and he asked on Friday quote
where was that effect yesterday what's
your response to Governor Cuomo well I
mean I
you know I'm always down to go
toe-to-toe sometimes but I think what's
what when you actually look at the
numbers that we focused on every single
down-ballot progressive candidate in my
district new york 14 1 new york had a
profound tide tidal change really in the
Democratic Party 1 out of every 5
Democratic senators got replaced on
Thursday night and the path to
eliminating the IDC was through New York
14 in my district so I'm proud to say
that every single locally endorsed
candidate that we mobilize for won our
election Cynthia Nixon did a phenomenal
job
she lost your district by 30 points
right right but we focused on our local
Kansas and we focused on the legislators
but you know I think that what she did
was that she censored a lot of
phenomenal issues she centered racial
justice she centered criminal justice
reform she centered the legalization of
marijuana single-payer health care and a
lot of down ballot candidates benefited
from that and what I also look forward
to moving forward is us rallying behind
all Democratic nominees including the
governor to make sure that he wins in
November your platform has called for
various new programs including Medicare
for all housing as a federal right a
federal jobs guarantee tuition free
public college canceling all student
loan debt according to a nonpartisan and
left-leaning studies friendly to your
cause including the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities or the Tax Policy
Center the overall price tag is more
than 40 trillion dollars in the next
decade you recently said in an interview
that increasing taxes on the very
wealthy plus an increased corporate tax
rate would make 2 trillion dollars over
the next ten years so where's the other
38 trillion dollars going to come from
well one of the things that we need to
realize when we look at something like
Medicare for all Medicare for all would
save the American people a very large
amount of money and what we see as well
is that these systems are not just pie
in the sky they are many of them are
accomplished by every modern civilized
democracy in the Western world the
United the United Kingdom has a form of
single-payer Healthcare Canada France
Germany what we need to realize is that
these investments are better and they
are
good for our future these are
generational investments so that not
just they're not short-term band-aids
but they are really profound decisions
about who we want to be as a nation and
as and how we want to act as the
wealthiest nation in the history of the
world right now I get that but the price
tag for everything that you've laid out
in your campaign is 40 trillion dollars
over the next 10 years I understand that
Medicare for all would cost more to some
wealthier people and to the government
and to taxpayers while also reducing
individual health care expenditures but
I'm talking about the overall package
you say it's not pie in the sky but 40
trillion dollars is quite a bit of money
and the the taxes that you talked about
raising to pay for this to pay for your
agenda only count for two and I'm we're
going by left-leaning analysts right
well when you look again at again how
our health care works currently we pay
much of these costs go into the private
sector so what we see is for example you
know a year ago I was working downtown
in a restaurant I I went around and I
asked how many of you folks have health
insurance not a single person did
because these were they were paying they
would have had to pay $200 a month for
for a payment for insurance that had an
eight thousand dollar deductible I'm
assuming I'm not gonna get an answer for
the other 38 trillion dollars but we'll
have you back and maybe we can go over
that but I do want to ask you about some
breaking news here because okay so I'm
gonna get to the Jake Tapper questions
in a second but first let me just touch
on the New York point so yes it is true
that there were three big left-wing
losses but the winds are as follows
working families party candidates
Alessandra Biaggi Jessica Ramos Rachel
Mei Zellner miry John Liu and Robert
Jackson won their races for state Senate
in New York virtually sweeping the
turncoat IDC caucus so for those of you
who don't know and I don't blame you if
you don't know because this is just a
New York thing the IDC is the
independent democratic conference and
they're basically Democrats who vote
with Republicans I mean that's the best
way to describe it the most simple way
to describe it
and you know this is the group that
Cuomo made a deal to basically turn
control of the Senate over to this group
and they get to stonewall whatever
progressive legislation he brings up so
he's parading around the state going yes
free college for everybody and then when
it doesn't get through he turns around
and gets to go the Democrats caucus with
the Republicans and that's why it's not
me it's them when why did you help turn
power and the Senate over to them but so
while we had the three big losses the
IDC was wiped out so that is a huge
piece of evidence when talking about the
impact of this election it's simply not
accurate to say all the left had all
losses no the left had three big losses
but we also had what one two three four
five six big wins so no you don't get to
just give one you no side of the picture
and then go ah they say there's no real
left-wing revolution here and if you
notice in in the mind of mainstream
media and the establishment whenever a
left-wing candidate wins it's a fluke
whenever a so-called centrist slash
corporatist Democrat wins it's because
they're better candidates and that's
what people want that's the way they
think when in reality it's actually the
opposite any time an establishment
candidate wins it's a fluke and it's a
fluke because they raise a tremendous
amount more money so they can get their
name out there more so they're more
likely to win the election simply by
word of mouth because they're out
spending their opponent so it's more
likely the case that the establishment
candidates are a fluke and the left-wing
candidate those are the real wins where
the people really want those people
based on their message based on their
policy substance and that's what the
polls show as well so they invert
reality he flips reality right on its
head
okay now putting the New York election
aside look at the line of questioning
from Jake Tapper this is not something
he does - you know Republican candidates
- establishment Democrats when they
decide to spend out the wazoo for
different priorities because those
different prior
these are things that Jake Tapper and
everybody else in the establishment they
just grandfather in Oh
tremendous tax cuts for the rich and for
corporations grandfathered in oh bombing
you know three or four new countries and
spending billions of dollar dollars in
the process grandfather that in Oh
endless corporate welfare to Walmart
next on mobile grandfather that in so
the question of how do we pay for it is
never asked when it's things that the
Empire has already deemed these are
Givens but whenever it's spending for
you that's why we gonna pay for it what
are we gonna take care of our fellow
citizens disgusting we need to find the
money to pay for that now there's a few
answers to that question there are
people who know about modern monetary
theory mmt school of economics and they
say well listen the real response to
that is you tell Jake Tapper hey [ __ ]
we control our own currency so of course
we could pay for it by definition we can
pay for it and it doesn't even need to
be deficit-neutral so that's the
response from mmt people now while I
agree with them on the substance I don't
think that as a messaging scheme as a
marketing aspect I don't think that
works because from what I've seen people
tend to scoff at the idea that we really
do control our own currency and that you
know it won't lead to runaway inflation
the reality is you also need political
instability to lead to a gigantic
inflation and bottom line is if you go
back and look at the the trillion-dollar
coin debate this was when there was the
debt ceiling standoff and then one of
the ideas that was proposed was we could
just mint two trillion dollar coin then
the deficit ceiling is taken care of
because we control our own currency so
if you mint one trillion-dollar coin
that solves the problem you don't even
need to worry about the debt ceiling and
that actually is a solution that would
work but it just doesn't sell well
because people tend to scoff at that
idea like oh really a trillion dollar
coin that like something about that just
feels off and people who don't know the
details of modern monetary theory would
look at that and go [ __ ] you guys
talking about that seems like really
irresponsible so even though you it is a
our response to Jake Tapper to say dude
it doesn't have to be deficit-neutral
like that's a fair response and that's
correct I would like to give them a
better answer than that to really shut
them up because that's a long-term
marketing goal is to get people to buy
into the framework of mmt but that's not
short term short term when he goes how
you gonna pay for it you have to have a
better answer so point number one is and
this is something that now is has
permeated and everybody saying well some
of the things you're mentioning don't
actually cost more money they call it
cost less money when you talk about
medicare-for-all yes it saves two
trillion dollars it saves the American
people two trillion dollars so right off
the bat I disagree with your premise
your premise is not correct how are we
gonna pay for the thing that would
actually cost less no the real question
should be how are we gonna pay for the
current system we have right now that's
the real question but beyond that okay
are you worried about the cost of you
know various programs that help the
American people like paid family leave
and and free college and wiping the
student loan debt slate clean well
here's the answer
we're gonna stop all offensive Wars
immediately bring the troops home we're
gonna cut our nine hundred military
bases at least 50% we're gonna end all
welfare - already profitable
mega-corporations we're gonna stop the
80 billion dollars in quantitative
easing that we give per year to big
banks we're gonna do a Wall Street
transaction tax which would raise a
tremendous amount of money we're gonna
increase the capital gains rate and in
fact we're gonna take the capital gains
rate which is tax on the money you make
through investments we're gonna chain
the capital gains rate to the income tax
rate so that if you make 5 million
dollars through investments some rich
person does that well instead of paying
15% or 20% the capital gains rate you're
gonna pay what the rate would be on the
top marginal rate as if it's regular
incomes you're gonna pay like 40 percent
and then also we could just increase the
top marginal rate and you could also add
new brackets right now if I'm not
mistaken I think the top bracket kicks
in it like over five hundred thousand or
over a million dollars why not add
another bracket for five million why not
another bracket for 10 million why not
add another bracket for [ __ ] 100
million
you should you should do that and then
we have a better progressive tax system
where you know you make it so that you
don't tax working people like crazy the
higher they go up the economic ladder
you tax them more and you make us a lot
more like Scandinavia in that respect
another thing you could do is close the
offshore tax havens where you know a
hundred billion dollars in government
revenue per year is hidden overseas from
these offshore tax havens in the Cayman
Islands and places like that and the
government just sits by and lets rich
people get away with it well how about
no you don't let the rich people get
away with that how about that so these
are all answers oh how do you pay for it
you do all the things I just mentioned
and then you probably do have enough to
pay for it just by doing that but even
if you don't that's when you can bring
up the point doesn't have to be deficit
neutral just like the Republicans did a
massive tax cut for the rich added it to
the deficit and then turn around to go
what do you mean this is fine we're
allowed to do this we prioritize the tax
cuts we're allowed to do it so why can't
we do the same thing and then turn
around and go yeah it's called Medicare
for all or it's called free college and
even if it does add to the deficit
whoopee free can do it's a moral
priority we are saying we are
grandfathering this in because it's
spending for the American people it was
the government doing what the government
should be doing but having said all that
given what I just said to pay for it I
think that'll be more than enough to pay
for it
never mind realigning current priorities
that we already have where we spend you
know too much money on certain things so
it's uh that's how you answer that
question but the thing is Jake Tapper's
line of questioning says everything
listen guys when it comes to to
messaging oftentimes it's not in the
answer it's in the question and the
question is let me repeatedly and
viciously you know go pedal-to-the-metal
full speed ahead trying to frame it as
if you agree with these priorities
Europe you know a dumb pie in the sky
unicorn fairy dust not realistic
lefty that's the framework that's the
underlying message now he might try to
you know say oh that's not the case I'm
just trying to do my job but again I
submit to you
look at how he frames questions against
corporate Democrats look at how he
frames questions against Republicans
look at their spending priorities and
his lack of questioning and then look at
how he frames it when it's the left and
you'll see exactly where his priorities
lie and we already know this cuz he did
that he's the guy who did the non fact
check fact check the [ __ ] fact check
that got ripped on Medicare for all and
uh everyone's like this is totally
inaccurate so he does like a little
tweak to it but then they repost it and
it's still largely [ __ ] and by the
way the heart of that so-called fact
check was Bernie says this would save
the government money and it doesn't save
the government money talking about
Medicare for all but Bernie didn't say
that Bernie said it would save the
American people money which is true so
it wasn't even a fact check it was just
[ __ ] propaganda done behalf of the
for-profit health insurance companies
and he went to the to the coke funded
so-called researchers and asked them hey
do you agree with Bernie Sanders that's
not a fact check Jake you're supposed to
be a fact check
not just Bernie but you're also supposed
to fact check the people who did the
research because maybe they have a
conflict of interest and they got say I
don't know coke brother [ __ ] money
you dumbass and that's what happened so
he's just a tool he's just a tool of the
establishment he's supposed to put on a
suit and look smug and sit up there and
pretend like he's calling balls and
strikes when the reality is he is deeply
ideological and he's embedded in the ass
of the establishment and that's why he's
gotten as far as he's got because he's
willing to do those talking points that
bolster the establishment narrative
while pretending he's not doing that
well he is and I'm here to call it out
hello boys and girls welcome to our show
you saw hurricanes about to [ __ ] up
North Carolina in South Carolina I was
just thinking about that [ __ ] man it's
[ __ ] really really scary like the
scariest part about it is like with all
the storms the Puerto Rico [ __ ] they're
like just the Hurricanes that always hit
Florida the fact that like you know
there's a reporter like standing where
the shit's about to be diesel and like
you just know it's coming but like the
weather's still fine man like people are
still on the beach and you just know in
a day or however many hours it's gonna
be like straight anarchy I thought that
was crazy too how like you can see them
on the beach and at like right then and
there the sun is shining and it looks
beautiful and there's just like a few
clouds in the sky you know and it's like
yes we know as a matter of fact that
that's all about to change
and imagine if you brought that
technology back to like 1820 and you
were like yo Liz and I'm gonna tell you
right now get the [ __ ] out get out
you're about to get destroyed in two
days time to be 150 mile an hour wind
right where you're standing they'd be
like no way get the phone here they
think you're a [ __ ] lunatic they
really got it no one you can't you don't
know what's gonna happen in two days
like this is weather you know like yeah
it's kind of crazy how we could predict
all that but it look it does it looks
crazy on the on like whatever the radar
thing is it's it's [ __ ] scary
it looks strong man that thing is huge
and it looks strong and they were saying
how usually the paths that hurricanes
would take this time of year it would
start it would start coming towards like
Florida / Georgia and then it would kind
of make an abrupt turn when it's
thousands of miles out in the sea and
just kind of taper off before it even
hits land but they said because of the
the conditions now whether it's they
said something about the pressure which
I don't know enough about to really
comment on but because of the way the
pressure is right now there's nothing
preventing it from just got walloping
North Carolina and South Carolina and
just going like making landfall at like
category 4 which is goddamn devastating
yeah yeah the fact that we can talk
about this and predict what's going to
happen
like shops like board up their walls
yeah and and know that their stuffs
gonna get completely demolished like
people that have stores right on the
black coast right there it's a rap like
don't even like I saw some lady like she
had a bakery she was like oh we're gonna
put stuff up all three feet in the air
and like [ __ ] I'm sorry but your shit's
not gonna be good money after this storm
yeah like it like it depends how like
what it's like when it hits because I
remember we got hit with Sandy and they
said that technically it was a really
really big category three mm-hmm so it
was like really long but the winds were
not that we're not a four or a five but
if you get hit with the four or five
that [ __ ] is no joke not just because of
the wind and the wind is crazy but also
because of the storm surge that like if
you're talking about like a ten foot
storm surge then whole areas are just
basically destroyed everything that's
like you know whatever ten feet above
sea level or less so yeah the the radar
is a ridiculous the fact that like you
can see the whole like just outline of
the storm imagine being in like a boat
right now in the middle of the water
there while that [ __ ] is just [ __ ]
going berserk in the water like I can't
imagine that and then there was a storm
that happened recently that completely
demolished like one of those like Saint
Martins or Saint whatever and they had
like a video camera on the island and it
was like that Island got hit like the
worst it was like when the storm was at
like it was it's Michael Jordan peak of
the [ __ ] storm yeah yeah I remember
that the whole island was just
obliterated and it's it's just madness
and scary and scary and scary that like
this stuff is just happening and
happening and we're just becoming like
sort of numb to it but it's on some and
I keep saying this [ __ ] they keep
putting day-after-tomorrow on TV because
this [ __ ] is happening like newscasters
are like there's gonna be the worst
storm and evacuate and all this [ __ ]
never
just like all it's gonna be a really bad
storm and then they get like some drunk
guy from North Carolina on TV like I'm
just gonna go buy some whiskey and like
everybody's like oh that's cute
you know but this is the beginning of
the [ __ ] world ending like like
people try to deny that [ __ ] but they
did the same [ __ ] in day after tomorrow
it was crazy
[ __ ] like storm patterns that
everybody was just like oh no this just
happens but it's like this stuff doesn't
happen like to evacuate people from like
where they live and like just straight
you know like have a whole like state
have to leave and go other places it's
like that's not normal like that's scary
well the thing that concerns me so for
all the science geeks out there let's
just get this out there because it is a
fact that you can't pin any individual
weather event to climate change but what
you can do is you can look at the
patterns over time because weather is
what happens on any given day climate is
the accumulation of weather events and
the pattern over an extended period of
time and what they say is there has been
an increase in extreme weather events
and you know that that does strike me as
pretty obvious I mean I remember when I
was a kid seeing a few example I think
it was like 1992 and there was Hurricane
Andrew which [ __ ] walloped Florida
but they I don't remember there being
this many that in a short time span
that's like oh it's gonna make landfall
and it's gonna like because it just
happened in Houston right and then it
happened Maria obliterated were Toriko I
mean it just absolutely destroyed Porto
Rico diploma they're still reeling
they're not recovered dude look in 3,000
people died in here came Maria and
Puerto Rico wild so it really is insane
but but I have your point fashioned it
was God if there was like Twitter and
news and all that [ __ ] back when we were
growing up to your point maybe you know
we would have thought it was a little
worse - yeah you know glamorizes gonna
say my bad
it's all good I forget [ __ ] all the time
anyway I have a weird fascination with
like I really like watching The Weather
Channel or AccuWeather or whatever when
there's an extreme event
happening bad for those [ __ ] people
no no I feel terrible for them I feel
her end I feel really bad for them but I
have a weird like I feel like I have to
watch it when there's an extreme weather
event happening and I'm like yeah what's
going on over here
mm-hmm and then and I just can't take my
eyes off it but what's funny is I
started I started doing that before and
I'm like the [ __ ] am I doing this thing
is thing is too like over a thousand
miles out in the ocean like it's not
even close to making landfall like it's
gonna make landfall I'm like [ __ ]
Thursday night or Friday morning or some
[ __ ] mm-hmm and I'm like oh what's it
doing now which is just silly I mean
it's it's it's fascinating to follow
though because it's like the that whole
the whole storyline behind it the fact
that like we know it's coming and we
sort of just have to just watch it
happen and there's nothing we can do
about it you know so you sort of become
invested in tracking this whole storm
you know our friend Bobby he now lives
in I think it's South Carolina might be
north [ __ ] but I was like yo there's a
mandatory evacuation dude
like where are you how closer to the
coast he's like oh no I'm like five
hours from the coast I was like oh
you're good you're good if you're five
hours from the coast I mean you might
get hit but your storm surge is not a
problem when you're five hours from the
coast and also if you live on the coast
you sort of have to know when you're
buying some [ __ ] yeah this is a
possibility that's I've said that a
million times like I would never buy
some [ __ ] on the water the only kind of
body of water where I'd be like okay
maybe is a lake I would never do a
[ __ ] ocean no are you kidding me like
that thing is a mother nature any given
second can swallow your punk ass up yeah
like that then you have to respect the
[ __ ] ocean the ocean is no joke now a
pond that's fine a lake that's fine but
actually the great lakes are no joke
either the great lakes are insane they
have like a current on the lake as they
are so big it's almost like it's almost
like a mini ocean like that's how big
the great lakes are yeah that's while
the scariest site is one like before the
storm hits you could see the ocean like
the water go off oh yeah there's a
tsunami well there's a tsunami you see
the water go although have you ever seen
the movie San Andreas with the rock
rakh no I enjoy that everything that
movies dumb because it's so hyperbolic
and like yeah but it's made that's the
whole point of it it's supposed to be
over-the-top but I really like well that
main type of [ __ ] what's that it's like
the world ending yeah kind of like a
world ending type of thing it's kind of
about the big earthquake that's
eventually going to hit California with
the San Andreas Fault but it's like it
really takes it like to the next level
you know it makes it like Oh imagine if
an earthquake could hit that's not even
as possible because it's so large yeah
yeah but I really like that week I was
just reminded that when you mentioned
the tsunami thing because yeah that that
[ __ ] is crazy you see and the crazy
thing is back in the day people didn't
know so all that water would recede and
people would walk out and then what
happens with the tsunami is not what a
lot of people think it's not like you
see in the movies with a giant 50-foot
wave that comes and takes over what
happens is it's like a small you know
whatever it is five feet ten feet
whatever it is but it goes in and it
just keeps going in and so it'll go
inland so I [ __ ] miles probably and
then it kills you like we you can't have
giant rushing water what I'm saying like
it's not it's not one tall wave it's
more just like us a smaller wave that
just keeps going inland
yeah well it's like it's probably like
that pinball pull [ __ ] like you pull it
back so far and then when you let go
it's just [ __ ] yeah washes at you and
you just can't even escape that [ __ ] I
think that tsunamis are tied to
earthquakes that like whenever there's
an earthquake like they could calculate
oh [ __ ] there's an earthquake at this
fault which is however belong into the
ocean
but that's when there'll be like oh [ __ ]
tsunami warning because that can trigger
a tsunami yeah it's got to be a little
scary like living in California one with
like forest fire shits well dude there's
not there are very few places that are
actually safe safe I actually looked
this up I'm really interested in this
question like what's the safest place
from natural disasters in the US I
looked up and they said some of it is
actually upstate New York believe it or
not so like Syracuse was on the list I
think Buffalo was on the list and then a
lot of it was in Ohio
there was like Akron Ohio because it's
flat well no because the thing is so if
you go to like to Oklahoma you're in
tornado alley you go to Texas you're in
tornado alley you go to California like
you said you have wildfires in Northern
California you have earthquakes there's
loads if you're anywhere on the East
Coast
like even even where I am in New York
it's still there still you know the
chance of a hurricane from time to time
nothing like the Florida hurricanes we
can still get hurricanes yeah so
anything on the East Coast you have to
worry about hurricanes and and the South
obviously anything you know on the west
coast wildfires earthquakes anything in
the middle tornadoes so then where is it
that you can that you're most likely to
get away from all of it and there are a
few pockets so like upstate New York is
safe statistically from it Ohio it
doesn't get much and I think there was
some in Illinois um actually Chicago was
on the list - they said Chicago is one
of the scenario place yeah cuz there's
nobody gonna get there I don't think we
have Lake Michigan that can [ __ ]
Walton they give caveat on all of them
cuz no place is totally safe but they do
say that some of them like Oh flooding
is the worst that could happen here yada
yada I mean there's no place that's safe
safe you know I mean like I remember I
was looking a while back I think we
spoke about this on the podcast I was
like what place has like 70 degree
weather all the time and it just doesn't
exist that's not a thing that exists
anywhere like San Diego is pretty
[ __ ] gorgeous all year round san
Diego's a lot warmer than that I think
like it can be really pretty warm San
Francisco I think is close to that 70
degree level but I think yeah like there
it's just there's no place where it's
like cuz obviously you have different
seasons and everything - I mean who are
we kidding but that was a question I was
interested in because that I was like
damn I wish I could there was a place
that was just 65 or 70 degrees all year
round sun shining that's just not saying
it's funny when something bizarre
happens you know in like a state that
isn't expected so I've kept like family
in Atlanta and it doesn't really like
snow there I mean like it snow so it all
chaos breaks loose when there is snowing
in the south you know is there not
prepared for it they're not prepared
it's like the little tiniest bit of
sauce it all down shuts everything down
[ __ ] don't know how to drive
they forget like how to shop they forget
how to talk it's like it's so weird
because it's like I don't know how far
is New York from Atlanta I don't like
912 hours now or something like that but
it's like people if it snows in New York
it's it's nothing like like it's nothing
we've got to go to work scope Owen yep
it has been a tremendous for for things
to shut down like it has to be a super
Blizzard like conditions for it to
happen but that's the thing like we eat
like if you look at our state
governments for example obviously in New
York they have to budget a lot for like
salt for example for the roads and the
other the [ __ ] plow the streets and
everybody has like a plan laid out and
like oh when this happens I pay this guy
80 bucks and he comes and he hits it
with the [ __ ] but you know a plow and
then I got my neighbor three doors down
helps me shovel and so everything is alt
like scheduled when you get some [ __ ]
like that in Georgia people like we we
weren't [ __ ] which snows once every
[ __ ] 40 years here we're not ready
for this [ __ ] yep
actually there's written how often it is
like is it once every like five years it
snows there something like that I mean
it does snow down there but every now
and then every now and then but it's
just they're not even though York man
like I've looked this up one day I
forget what the exact number was but I
want to say it was probably like
something like eleven days on average of
the year it snows in New York mm-hmm
which is not that much cuz so if
somebody is listening to me now and they
live in Alaska those [ __ ] are
laughing at us no oh you think you know
snow [ __ ] you want to see snow
[ __ ] and they'll show you like
son it is just twelve feet of snow on a
regular basis but even rain like
California the fact that they get no
rain when it rains a little bit they're
like it's it's it's like all hell breaks
loose but it mean they're so dependent
on rain yeah the fact that someone can
just go like in the [ __ ] forest start
a fire and that [ __ ] just spreads to
like even the water like we've spoken
about before how there are signs when
you when we went to LA were there signs
that said you know you should limit
or I don't I don't think that when we
were there because they had just had
rain before we went but I think if you
live there it's a gnome thing yes like
oh you're a dick if you're sprinkling
your grass or some [ __ ] you know like
you're that [ __ ]
if like your sprinklers are on yeah it's
like why are you doing that meanwhile
here it's been raining for the past like
three or four days man it's been I
haven't seen the Sun in like four days
it's starting to drive me crazy like I
uh yeah it's been raining for the past
so we got the the remnants of a tropical
storm like that they had the golf
tournament in Pennsylvania and it got
rained out on Sunday and they had to
finish on Monday but it was raining like
crazy and then we got the remnants of
that so it was like little it was like I
feel like Sunday it was like just kind
of overcast but not raining and then
Saturday arraigned wait I'm sorry
Saturday was when it was overcast but
not raining then Sunday it rained Monday
it rained and then Tuesday it rained and
was overcast mm-hmm so it's just been
like I want to see the Sun I don't think
about how much I love it until it's gone
and then I'm like oh just give me and I
don't mind the Cape don't get me wrong I
actually kind of like the occasional
like gray day where it rains a little
bit yeah actually kind of like that but
it's got to be every now and then and
you can't hit me with it like four days
in a row cuz then I start crazy and then
i ask people like send me your picture
of the sun or whatever like and people
were sending me all these pictures from
around the world through like all these
are so beautiful like every picture
looks so gorgeous i was like oh that
looks i wish i was right there right now
each one better than the next just like
i got pictures from turkey i got
pictures from you know [ __ ]
california just it was awesome i really
like looking at those those picture i
mean sometimes it's nice to just [ __ ]
see the sun it makes you it makes you
happier i know i like have a tendency to
want to like work out more when it's
nice around like when it's dreary and
gray you don't want to do [ __ ] yeah
that's true mean and that's people in
[ __ ] seattle look at that [ __ ] all
the time
speaking of a dreary this is the
opposite of that but did you see um so I
was gonna ask you will talk about 9/11
in a second so I want to remember what
you were doing when 9/11 happened but
there was a picket there was the 9/11
memorial today and
Trump was there and there's a picture
him when he gets off I guess Air Force
One or whatever and he's walking with
Melania behind him and some Secret
Service guys and he's doing a double
like fist pump and he's like yeah like
he's doing this yes thing and it's like
what the [ __ ] everybody's like what is
he doing and then I tweeted that's when
the adderall hits because I think that
actually might be like that like that is
how somebody who's high as [ __ ] on
adderall or something would react cuz
they're not like he's not tuned into the
so there's a really interesting article
in the opinion section of the New York
Times this article went viral you're
about to see why it went viral basically
the gist of it is there's a top
administration official that says hey
I'm part of their resistance also I'm
trying to block what Donald Trump is
doing and don't worry
there are adults in the room we know
that the entire country thinks he's an
unhinged lunatic we agree that he's an
unhinged lunatic and so we're basically
blocking parts of his agenda that we
disagree with and dislike so that's the
gist of the story I'm gonna give you I'm
gonna give you some hefty chunks of the
story here so you get a sense of exactly
where this person falls but it's titled
I am part of the resistance inside the
Trump administration I work for the
president this is the subtitle I work
for the president but like-minded
colleagues and I have vowed to thwart
parts of his agenda and his worse
inclinations President Trump is facing a
test to his presidency unlike any faced
by a modern American leader so here's
what this anonymous person says they
asked the New York Times for anonymity
they granted it and that of course is
another huge aspect to the story Twitter
was blowing up over that with rampant
speculation as to who could have written
it but it they say or he or she says the
dilemma which he does not fully grasp is
that many of the senior officials in his
own administration are working
diligently from within to frustrate
parts of his agenda and his worst
inclinations I would know I am one of
them to be clear ours is not the Popular
Resistance of the left we want the
administration to succeed and think that
many of its policies have already made
America safer and more prosperous but we
believe our first duty is to this
country and the president continues to
act in a matter in a manner that is
detrimental to the health of our
Republic that is why many Trump
appointees have vowed to do what we can
to preserve our democratic institutions
while thwarting mr. Trump's more
misguided impulses until he is out of
office the root of the problem is the
president's immorality anyone who works
with him knows he is not more to any
discernable first principles that guide
his decision-making although he was
elected as a Republican the president
shows little affinity for ideals long
espoused by conservatives free minds
free markets and free people at best he
has invoked these ideals in scripted
settings at worst he has attacked them
outright in addition to his mass
marketing of the notion that the press
is the enemy of the people
president Trump's impulses are generally
anti trade and anti-democratic don't get
me wrong there are bright spots that the
the near ceaseless negative coverage of
of the administration fails to capture
effective deregulation a historic tax
reform a more robust military and more
alright let me pause on that note ok
just based off of that one little part
right there the don't get me wrong there
are bright spots historic tax reform
deregulation a more robust military I
already know I despise whoever wrote
this because this is exactly the kind of
stuff that I've warned you about that
establishment Republicans love
everything about Donald Trump - the mean
tweets so in other words their
disagreement with him is on civility and
tone but everything in terms of his
policies they're like oh I pretty much
agree with that wholesale and the few
instances where they disagree with him
are instances where Trump isn't even
necessarily wrong where I think his
instinct is right even though the
details of how he's implementing that
instinct are not right and what I'm
referring to more specifically his trade
see this is the kind of Republican that
listens to Trump when he was on the
campaign trail railing against NAFTA
railing against the TPP railing against
outsourcing deals and this kind of
Republican goes oh he's wrong about
those things I disagree with him on
those things obviously we have to do the
bidding of the capitalists and
corporatists
billionaires and corporations and
outsource all the good-paying US jobs to
third world countries and pay them slave
wages so I'm already annoyed by the
people who would like fawn over whoever
wrote this article because on that alone
they're letting you know oh I kind of
agree with most of him policy wise and
in the areas where I disagree with him
he's probably better on those issues so
but I'm part of the resistance no you're
not part of the resistance that's not
part of the resistance that's you know
you're an accomplice to every single
thing that he's doing and also as Chris
Hayes pointed out this is a good point
this is this is more or less an
insurance policy so that this might be
people in the administration going oh
[ __ ] we actually think something might
happen with this Muller investigation
and we don't know how certain Donald
Trump's future is in the White House so
now we're all gonna hedge and I'm gonna
write an article like this and then if /
when the [ __ ] hits the fan they get to
turn around afterwards and say no no the
problem isn't the Republican Party the
problem is just that one rogue actor
donald trump and you know outside of him
we're all totally good and we're we you
know we're not classless and we weren't
part of the trump agenda he was an
aberration he's the single only bad guy
here and the rest of us are still
perfectly fine so it's a last-ditch
attempt to save the Republican brand I
mean that that's a certainly a strong
possibility but let me continue I want
to give you some more stuff that they
say here or I should say he or she says
here but these successes have come
despite not because of the president's
leadership style which is adversarial
petty and ineffective meetings with him
veer off topic and off the rails he
engages in repetitive rants and his
impulsiveness results in half-baked
ill-informed and occasionally reckless
decisions that have to be walked back
and maybe cold comfort in this chaotic
era but Americans should know that there
are adults in the room we fully
recognize what is happening and we are
and we are trying to do what's right
even when Donald Trump won't all right
pause one more time
listen if you're for deregulation as
this person says they are if you're for
the the tax cuts for the rich and this
person says they are if you're for a
more robust military and this person
says they are you're not an adult
you're not the adults in the room you're
the kid in the class who's arguing with
the teacher who thinks he's a genius and
he's right about everything but actually
he's calmly getting schooled by the
teacher that's what you are and by the
way in this analogy the teacher I'm
talking about is not Donald Trump the
teacher would be the left so for them to
say oh there are adults in the room but
anyway we did more deregulation which is
gonna guarantee the next crash and in
fact is gonna speed it up
you're not an adult you're an idiot if
you're going by the same economic
policies that we had in the 19-teens in
the 1920s that led to the Great
Depression you're implementing the same
economic policies that Ronald Reagan did
which led to a crash right when he got
out of office you're implementing the
same economic policies of Bill Clinton
with getting rid of glass-steagall
george w bush with put doing more
deregulation more tax cuts for the rich
you're doing these same policies that
blew a giant hole in the deficit and
absolutely destroyed the economy led to
the subprime mortgage crisis in the
Great Recession if you backed those
policies you're not an adult in the room
so let's just be clear about that you're
not an adult I know you're trying to
suck yourself off here and say ah Trump
is bad boss other Republicans are good
but you're not good
Trump sucks and you suck okay more it
may be cold comfort in this chaotic era
but Americans should know that there are
adults in the room I already said that
we fully recognize what is happening and
we are trying to do what's right even
when Donald Trump won't the result is a
two-track presidency take foreign policy
in public and in private president Trump
shows a preference for autocrats and
dictators such as Vladimir Putin and
North Korea's leader Kim Jong hoon and
displays little genuine appreciation for
the ties that bind us two allied
like-minded nations astute observers
have noted though that the rest of the
administration is operating on another
track one where countries like Russia
are called out for meddling and punished
accordingly and we're allies around the
world are engaged as peers rather than
ridiculed as rivals let me pause there
also seventy-three percent of the
world's dictatorships are backed by the
u.s. we give them
weapons we give them money 73% that
that's not like Oh Donald Trump came in
there and he started that policy no he
went in there and he continued that
policy the same policy that was the case
under Barack Obama the same policies
that was the case under george w bush so
I did this actually pisses me off more
maybe than even the other part and the
reason is Donald Trump is a crude
jackass and he's an idiot okay but he
doesn't bother trying to like mask US
imperialism and war mongering whereas
Obama and George W Bush they pretended
like we aren't war mongers we aren't an
imperialist nation as we acted that way
so for this person in the administration
to act like oh I can't believe this
President is fond of dictators other
presidents aren't fond of dictators what
are you talking about all the other
presidents were fond of dictators Trump
is just open and honest about that fact
which by the way I don't want to act
like that's me giving Trump credit it's
not I think he's too stupid to do the
tap dance that the other presidents do
to mask it but it is me saying they are
substantively no different Sally if we
got rid of Trump and Pence was president
all the sudden tomorrow boom we cut off
the relationship with a 73% of the
world's dictators we wouldn't do that
which is why this is [ __ ] frustrating
more given the instability many
witnessed there were early whispers
within the cabinet of invoking the 25th
amendment which would start a complex
process for removing the president but
no one wanted to precipitate a
constitutional crisis so we will do what
we can to steer the administration in
the right direction until one way or
another it's over this isn't the work of
the so-called deep state it's the work
of the steady state okay
now let's let me give them credit in one
sense okay and then I have salt I have a
lot of mixed feelings about this as you
could probably already tell are there
some instances we
you yes any reasonable pragmatic person
all other points aside about process and
about the way the system should work and
all that stuff can any reasonable person
say that in certain scenarios you do
want somebody to basically tame the
toddler Donald Trump and take matters
into their own hands
yeah and in fact I'm gonna get to a
story a little bit later in this show
that dives into that there were
instances where Trump all he has to do
is see one like a negative news report
about what's happening in Syria and he
literally is like okay let's go kill the
sod and do it now why are we waiting
let's go do it
so in a situation like that it's so he
like they pointed out he does he has no
principles and he's deeply amoral and
he's a buffoon who can put his finger in
the Windigo which way is it blowing I'm
gonna go in that direction and there's
no deep analysis there's no thought it's
and it's so funny for a guy who
ironically screams fake news all the
time when he saw the report on Syria his
initial instinct was not to scream fake
news it was to say everything he's
exactly correct and now we're I'm gonna
act in accordance with that and I'm just
gonna go topple him and I want to go
take out Bashar al-assad so are there
some instances where you want an adult
to go hmm pipe down [ __ ] that's not
happening we're gonna handle this like
adults yes there are some instances like
that so in a sense I get why everybody's
like oh okay
it's good that there are people who are
like winking and nodding and going yeah
we know he's an idiot and we're
basically placating him and finding a
way to manage him while we try to do
more reasonable things so on the one
hand I get that but there are also like
when they say this isn't the work of the
so-called deep state is the work of the
steady state you know no no you don't
get to say that you don't get to say
we're undermining the person who is
democratically elected and then also say
oh but don't worry it's not like there's
this big conspiracy to work against him
no that's literally what it is now you
can make an argument as tono does here's
why that is a good thing but don't don't
give me that [ __ ]
speak out of both sides of your mouth
crap because that's what that is
like oh sure we're undermining him and
it is a conspiracy but just don't call
it the deep state it's because it's the
steady state no no no no no no it is the
deep state it is the deep state now you
could say well traditionally deep state
really means more CIA than anything else
and this is not CIA this is from within
his own cabinet fair enough but the fact
remains there are establishment figures
who are aligned to undermine him
sometimes for better sometimes for worse
but that is 100% the dynamic of what's
happening and you don't get to say oh
it's but don't call it a conspiracy you
don't call it the deep state [ __ ] off at
least be open and honest about what
you're really doing here don't try to
pretend like we're all noble heroes and
then another important point is dude
what about the precedent this sets so
imagine for a second Bernie Sanders gets
elected president and you have some
establishment minded Democrats who are
in his administration and you know maybe
they played the role well of pretending
to be progressive so everybody thinks
they're really progressive but no if you
scratch beneath the surface you look
beneath the surface I think I mixed two
analogies there you can tell very
quickly their establishment Democrats
well how would we feel if an
establishment Democrat was undermining
Bernie Sanders and at the same time
acting like no we're a hero because
crazy Bernie doesn't understand the
nuances of our health care system and he
thinks he's somehow gonna give us
Medicare for all which would catch us up
to the rest of the developed world but
Bernie that's too big of a change we
can't start from scratch let's be
realistic with me pragmatic we can't do
those things
so we're I'm part of the resistance from
within Bernie Sanders White House and
I'm actively undermining what he's doing
I think that not only would I disagree
with that person substantively I think
it would be fair to make an argument on
principle as to why that shouldn't be
allowed because Bernie Sanders agree or
disagree with him in this hypothetical
scenario he was democratically elected
you were not democratically elected or
maybe we're democratically elected but
you weren't on the top of the ballot so
I don't it's a little weird to me that
people would just cheer this and not
think about the implications of it and
not think about the precedent that this
sets because it's almost like with the
Alex Jones thing Oh
it talks about how you know the media's
against me and the establishments
against me and then they kind of take
this crackpot who's wrong about 96% of
the [ __ ] he says but they proved him
right in that instance that there
actually was a big tech conspiracy 2d
platform him because he got pulled down
from all these different platforms all
at the same time so the way you you know
debunked the conspiracy theorist is not
to have a smoke-filled back room with
all the billionaire tech CEOs that then
act on him and censor him so you see
what I'm saying so with Trump it's a
similar thing it's like all the fake
news media's against me and the [ __ ]
the establishments against me and it's
me versus the system and I'm for the
little guy and then people you know
basically do something like this and
they act as if they're heroes when this
is not going to be viewed among people
who even just lean in support of Trump
this is not going to be viewed as oh
these people are heroes it's gonna be
viewed as oh my god the deep state
subverting the Democratic will of the
people with our elected leader so it's a
difficult situation man it's a difficult
situation I have there I have mixed
feelings about this for sure and then
like I pointed out before this is also
an attempt where if / when it goes wrong
people will go oh that was Trump was bad
but all the other Republicans are good
even though our policies are like 90%
aligned with Trump
we're like they'll pretend like the
polar opposite of Trump but you're not
just because you're not like him in tone
does not mean you're you're dislike him
substantively in fact you are very like
him substantively and then the final
thing I'll bring up is this there was a
word used in the article the word is
lodestar ello de st AR don't feel bad if
you don't know what that word means I
didn't know what it meant what it meant
in fact I don't think I've ever heard
that word before it's a weird word to
use it's just not a word that's commonly
used and that word was in the article
well a reasonable thing to do if you're
trying to figure out hey who wrote this
article who's the anonymous source from
within the Trump White House a
reasonable thing to do is to try to find
hey is there
do people in the White House has anybody
have a record of using that word well
come to find out Mike Pence uses that
word all the time so a lot of people are
saying oh it's 100% Mike Pence who wrote
this article I wouldn't say a hundred
percent that certainly is evidence that
perhaps he wrote the article but there's
another possibility that possibility is
somebody's framing Mike Pence
it's either pence wrote it in which case
holy [ __ ] the vice president is actively
undermining the president and he dropped
a [ __ ] word on that only he uses and a
holy [ __ ] there's gonna be fireworks
coming or somebody's purposely trying to
undermine pence and make it look like
it's pets to sow discord from within the
White House and make it even more
chaotic than it already is either way
that's wild either way that's wild and
again I don't know what's gonna happen
moving forward it seems to me like
they're laying the groundwork for
plausible deniability
if slash wind the Muller situation goes
after Trump in a way that he might not
be able to recover from so it's kind of
like an insurance policy let's distance
ourselves a little bit so that if slash
when the [ __ ] hits the fan whoever wrote
this piece is gonna come out say it was
me and I wasn't just representing me I
was representing every other Republican
so john mccain passed away from brain
cancer i want to give everybody a
breakdown of his record this includes
the good and the bad now I have to say I
don't I actually don't like talking ill
of the recently deceased and the reason
for that is I don't wish anybody harm
even people who I despise even people
who you could say are criminals I don't
wish them harm I have a principled
stance against death I guess you could
say I hate hate hate the idea of
rejoicing and somebody's demise because
something about that strikes me as like
I don't know fundamentally not leftist
if that makes sense if we really do care
about improving everybody's life well I
find it a weird carve out to say unless
I hate the person disagree with the
person you know unless the person has
done terrible things because then it's
like okay well then you don't really
wish well on people you just kind of say
you do
but then when at the drop of a hat
whenever it's convenient you're like
yeah [ __ ] that [ __ ] my principles I'm
done with it so and also of course cuz
the family thing and yada yada I mean I
just it's just a weird thing I have
where I don't like the idea of speaking
ill of the recently deceased now at the
same time I value truth above all else
so it's like how do you balance the
first thing with the second thing the
second thing being if you take an
objective look at his record it's not
that good and the thing that makes it
more annoying is that the over-the-top
worship of McCain which is happening
right now that's inherently political so
when people say oh you're not allowed to
you know talk
about John McCain I mean the response to
that is well then nobody should really
be able to talk good about him and have
this overwhelming you know feeling of
gratitude and call him an American Hero
and act like this is a statesman I've
seen so many over-the-top tweets I mean
one Anna Navarro was like the idea of
John McCain and Aretha Franklin and the
freshmen section of heaven together kind
of makes me smile it's like what the
[ __ ] are you guys talking about so it is
inherently political if you're gonna
take somebody like John McCain and then
after his death act like Oh his record
is tremendous it's amazing he's an
American Hero and this is the kind of
person that all the politicians should
aspire to act like you don't get to say
that and then turn around and go but you
can't disagree with him and bash him
because then what you're saying is his
politics are being held up and you
cannot say that they shouldn't be held
up or you know your tasteless you're an
[ __ ] well no because if you're gonna
say good things then people need to be
allowed to say bad things as well and
try to point out things that are just
not good in his record so I try to
always balance those two things valuing
truth above all else but at the same
time it's just a weird thing I have
where I don't I don't like the idea of
speaking ill of the recently deceased
but so so we can balance it and my whole
thing is like I feel terrible for
McCain's family I wish that this didn't
happen I wish she didn't have cancer I
wish she didn't die all of that's true
but at the same time I'm gonna tell you
the truth about his record and on that
front hmm you should probably buckle up
so first I'll let's be kind here and
I'll go to the good stuff first cuz it's
not like there's no good stuff there is
some good stuff so what the most recent
example of course is he saved Obamacare
now you guys know my whole take on
Obamacare it's a it's a mealy-mouthed
centrist corporatist largely garbage
piece of legislation but having said
that it's better than what we had before
so it's a giant step
the right direction even though
ultimately it's a piece of legislation
that's [ __ ] terrible so he stepped in
and saved it at the last moment they
were trying to do an official repeal of
Obamacare and if he went the other way
they would have repealed Obamacare fully
now don't get me wrong Donald Trump has
done countless executive orders that
have basically destroyed Obamacare
without officially repealing it so it's
already on the ropes it's already
destroyed because of Trump's actions but
this would have been official through
Congress it would have gone even further
and John McCain saved it now I do I
think John McCain saved it because of
principle as everybody will tell you now
when you hear everybody fawning over him
in mainstream media no I don't think so
I think he actually saved it probably
because of petty personal reasons
because Donald Trump had been an [ __ ]
to McCain you know I like people who
weren't captured he's a hero because
he's captured all like people who
weren't captured so since Trump was an
[ __ ] to McCain McCain stepped in at
the last minute and said okay do you
think I'm not gonna get you back for
that [ __ ] off now I'm gonna save
Obamacare and it said that you know
millions of people's health care is tied
into some petty personal politics some
[ __ ] that's happening in Washington
DC but I think that's the case that
because what actually happened and he
did end up on the proper side of that so
I'm not saying he did it for ideological
reasons because I don't think he did but
either way the effect of what he did was
oh you're actually helping a lot of
people so that's the most recent example
of him being a maverick overall he's I
don't think he's a maverick overall but
there were little examples here and
there where you go okay at least he's
different than the total run-of-the-mill
Republicans who are basically down the
line horrendous and I mean of course the
Republicans in DC the politicians okay
the the second positive thing is he was
in favor of campaign finance reform some
of you may remember this others may not
mccain feingold well that i mean that
don't get me wrong that's another one of
its kind of like obamacare and then it's
a mealy-mouthed centrist [ __ ] piece
of legislation but again it's better
than what we had before so at least you
can give him credit for at least
acknowledging that hey yeah money in
politics is probably a problem
now at the same time you don't give him
that much credit because it's not like
he didn't serve his donors he served his
donors dutifully so you know you're only
given half credit here but again at
least he was in favor of some kind of
reform for campaign finance reform the
bare minimum let's say and then there's
one personal aspect of him and one
policy aspect defendant deserves the
most credit the personal aspect is that
when he was captured in Vietnam and
tortured he was offered hey man his dad
was a powerful person and so as a as a
token gesture his Vietnamese captors
said okay well we're gonna release you
and McCain basically said no you're not
releasing me unless you release
everybody that you have in custody and
so he ended up staying there for I think
it was over five years so on a for a
personal story yeah that's that's crazy
and that takes a lot of courage and I
don't know I don't know how many people
would have done that I mean my guess is
less than 5% of people in that situation
would have said yes I'm going to do
self-sacrifice for everybody else who is
also in this terrible situation and I'm
going to stay with them and I'm choosing
to do that so that's the personal angle
where everybody said so that's you know
when people got really mad because Trump
was like he's not he's not a war hero
he's Wario because he's captured and
then everybody was mad at Trump when he
said that it's I think that's the reason
why because anybody who knows that
particular story is like really being
mad over you're gonna you're gonna say
he's not a war hero when that story on
its own merits this would kind of be
like the definition of being a war hero
like no I'm not gonna be released even
though you want to at least make someone
to stay with my fellow soldiers now
don't get me wrong I also need to
mention because it's totally pertinent
to the situation here the war in Vietnam
was a crime it was a crime I mean the US
was responsible for massacring
innocent Vietnamese I mean what do we
kill over a million people including you
know like carpet bombing civilian
centers on purpose so it's a little
weird in the context of the u.s.
basically committing a genocide against
landless third-world peasants it's kind
of weird to say well credit to this guy
for being heroic in the midst of us
doing a genocide which is but that's why
I'm bringing up the second part of the
story here which is I think you can make
both those points at the same time which
is from on a personal level yes it did
take courage to say I'm going to stay
and continue to be tortured regardless
of the other facts of that situation
yeah that takes a lot of [ __ ] courage
there's no doubt about it but it also is
true that yeah what the US was doing or
crimes out-and-out you know napalm Agent
Orange all innocent villagers just
getting obliterated there's no amount of
historical revisionism that can make
what the US did in Vietnam okay there's
no amount and if you're somebody who's
inclined to still defend the war in
Vietnam at this point I think that's
almost comically stupid given what we
know I mean it was an offensive war of
course against a country that didn't
attack us the whole idea was oh my god
we have to fight there because we're in
this giant you know this larger war it's
a proxy war for the US versus the Soviet
Union and we have to stop we have to
fight the spread of communism because if
we don't fight it in Vietnam next thing
you know it's gonna be on our doorstep
in South Dakota and that wasn't true and
in the process we massacred innocent
people all over the place so I think
that you have to weigh that in
consideration and you have to point that
out you also point out the thing about
him being captured but you I mean you
can't overlook what Vietnam was and by
the way I'm getting more and more angry
at this idea of just calling it a
mistake like oh it's a mistake
yeah what are you gonna do we [ __ ] up
you know like oh I slipped on a banana
peel
it's a mistake no it is a war crime and
it is a massacre of innocent people on
purpose and that is terrorism that's
what that is just because we do it just
because we do it does not mean is by
definition okay or or by definition
better than when the the official bad
guys do it that tactic and those actions
on their own merits are immoral
there is no hedging because it's us that
carried it out so I want to be clear
about that as well but I think the best
part of his legacy of course is the
torture stance now there is a tinge of I
don't know the right word for it but
there's a tinge of something bad about
it because it's it's the classic
situation of a Republican not believing
in something and then when they have
direct experience with it then they flip
and they have the proper position
reminded of like Dick Cheney and gay
marriage finding out his daughters gay
like Oh was I against gay marriage I'm
totally for it now and it's happened
time and time again on a variety of
different issues
chris Christie with FEMA spending being
against a big federal government and we
don't need the stinkin Fed let's leave
it up to the states and then the second
that are hurricane Wallops New Jersey
begging FEMA for reimbursement funds so
it's the classic story of oh yeah I have
a strong principled stance oh [ __ ] this
affects me now now I'm gonna flip and
with McCain it is beyond personal
because he was tortured so he knows how
terrible it is how bad it is how immoral
it is how wrong it is how it doesn't
work and all of that and so at a time
when virtually every elected Republican
in Washington DC was like oh we're now
for torture and not only that we're
gonna be weasels about it and lie about
it and say it's enhanced interrogation
and it doesn't count as torture even
though we literally got our techniques
from a Communist Chinese manifesto on
how to torture McCain was the only voice
of reason on that side that said no I'm
against that so now again this is like
it's almost like what a low bar like oh
you're against one of the most vicious
things anybody could ever do
I guess you're you know you're a voice
of reason it's like damn what look at
how far we've come or you have to praise
somebody because they're Against Torture
I mean that's like praising somebody
because it's like oh they took a
principled anti-rape stance it's like
but you that's the default you should be
on that on that page I mean what the
[ __ ] are we talking about here but still
it has to be said that at a time when
the entire Republican Party went full
fascist and by the way there's still
Trump himself signed a pro torturer
executive order when he gave his on the
same day he gave his State of the Union
address so at a time when they've all
gone nuts he's like no I disagree with
that that's wrong and here's why that's
wrong and he's given countless speeches
in the Senate on this exact issue and
he's crystal clear about it so that he
deserves credit for now that's the good
eye I think I've been very kind and
laying out the good now it's time to get
to the bed so first of all he picks our
Palin for his VP this is an easy one
this is what everybody's pointing out
and the reason why this is so egregious
is because for a guy who is held up as
like oh he's a maverick he's the
ultimate non-political actor he's a
principled man you don't get to hold
that guy up and give that argument when
he did the ultimate in political
maneuvering by picking Sarah Palin to be
his VP you think he didn't know that
she's not all that bright you think he
didn't understand that she wouldn't make
a good president and by the way he's old
as hell even back in 2008 so there was a
chance he would die in his time in
office if you were to win the election
and he would be handing the country over
to Sarah Palin so the thing that's so
amazing about that is it basically
immediately blows up all of the
mythology surrounding McCain he's above
politics he's a maverick which is why he
did the ultimate political move and pick
Sarah Palin and the reason he picks our
Palin is he understood okay well I'm an
old white man so I mean and I'm running
against the black guy so ooh
to try to be hip and cool and young and
with it and and how do we do that well
we we have to balance it out so he was
playing identity politics effectively
and said I need oh I need a woman and so
he picks our Palin and of course that
was the ultimate political pick and it
would have been a disaster for the
country and then he also made Sarah
Palin this important national figure so
he gave her that platform gave her that
voice where she continues to this day to
spew idiocy all over the country so
really important point that he is the
opposite of the mythology that's been
created about him Oh Hayes above
politics no he's not he plays it like
yet all the other politicians in
Washington DC and it's even worse
because he screams through a megaphone
that he is above politics and then he
does the ultimate political maneuver
okay that's the first thing second thing
is and this is one that's not brought up
nearly enough and I haven't seen a
single person in corporate media pointed
out since John McCain passed away he
voted against Martin Luther King Day he
and it wasn't like oh it was like a
50/50 thing no the overwhelming majority
was in favor of it he was one of the few
that voted against it now you could say
oh it's symbolic that's this that's that
but again that strikes me as a very
political thing to do you know if you're
a Republican politician and you know the
record of conservatives on the issue of
race in the US and how the Republican
Party ever since the signing of the
Civil Rights Act in the Voting Rights
Act they've been running the southern
strategy to appeal to you know Southern
whites you're a Republican if you vote
against Martin Luther King Day knowing
what we know about the moral legacy of
Martin Luther King well that tells me
you're just a ranked partisan actor in
many respects which leads me to my next
point
Jake Tapper pointed out oh he's polar
opposite quote polar opposite of Donald
Trump and that's why he's getting so
much praise these days but he voted with
Donald Trump eighty-three percent of the
time
that's that's a real number 83% 538
tracks in the age of Trump what
percentage a given politician votes were
shrunk 83% is tremendously high and by
the way some of those votes where he
disagrees with Trump I would say Trump
is right
like I think McCain was for TPP Trump of
course pulled out of TPP and by the way
he's still slipping in provisions of TPP
into the renegotiation of NAFTA which
they're actually announcing right now
the renegotiation a NAFTA as I speak
right now to you but so it's not even
like where he disagrees with Trump he's
being a real maverick and that he's
taking a moral stand know sometimes he's
actually on the wrong side of it so it's
mixed sometimes he's right sometimes
Trump's right in the areas where they
disagree but when you agree with him
over 83% of the time you're not polar
opposite now some people pointed out to
me on Twitter and I knew I was gonna get
this response yes but you have to
understand that when we say he's polar
opposite we mean in temperament we mean
and we mean in civility we mean in
decorum and my response that is then
you're a sucker because that's not
politics is not about if you're a mean
tweeter or a nice tweeter politics is
not about if you can give a wonderful
soaring rhetorical flowery speech in
fact the whole point of those speeches
is to divert you from the substance
which is how they're actually voting so
if you're willing to weigh you know in
an equal basis their policies versus how
they sound when they talk well you're
asking you're begging to be misled
because of course you know George W Bush
gave lovely speeches while he was
bombing babies in Iraq does that mean oh
well the bombing was wrong but the
speech was nice so we give him a grade
of like a C no that's not you don't
balance those two things and then
furthermore it's actually not even true
that oh you know hey he shows he has
decorum because McCain is was is known
for her
a very short fuse and a shitty temper so
it's not even true even if I grant you
the argument that we should care as much
about decorum and civility versus
policies but I don't even grant that
because you shouldn't evo2 you're the
voting record is all it really matters
and it drives me crazy that some people
are willing to overlook that for the
[ __ ] angle of politics which is the
diversionary tactics of what they say I
mean the whole point you should never
trust what a politician says ever ever
go to their voting record that's how you
know what they're really about then now
we get into the worst of the worst that
was just the appetizer for the bad stuff
but he voted for the Patriot Act
unacceptable
UI nobody gets to say they love the
TYT reporter eric Beiler spoke to some
people at a trump rally they turned out
to be alex jones fans as well so they
had it interesting back and forth let's
watch and then we'll discuss life's
blood for this state is cold the more
liberal politicians tend to want to shut
down the coal plants and that you know
that's gonna bankrupt the state what
else is at stake for you as you look at
President Trump battling to keep control
of Congress
facing the investigations and all of
that freedom of speech number one
absolutely one of my one of my favorite
newscasters has just recently been
banned from you know YouTube and
Facebook platforms why do you think Alex
Jones was banned a lot of people don't
like his message I enjoy his message I'm
not one of those people that believes
everything he says however he puts an
interesting spin on turning the frogs
gay for example it really makes you uh
it really makes you look at the white
papers I don't know a single thing that
he says except for the Newtown massacre
not having happened but what is the
frogs being gay chemicals in the water
basically you've got male frogs you know
no longer inclined to breed with females
so it's like or talk I mean there's son
this stuff is done in labs there are
scientific facts there's things that
people do that aren't covered or that
they just mock at or laugh at but it
saying that there's something in the
water that turns frogs gate chemicals
that are put in certain places and when
they do these labs or they do these
studies and they find out hey this is
what's causing this and then it's just
thrown under the table like it's nothing
or that you know well we don't even
agree or we don't listen to you because
you support Trump that's what's
aggravating for our side is that when
you have general facts or you're like
well here we just want to understand
this or explain to us why this happens
and then they shut you down and scream
at you and call you names and call you
racist and call you everything else and
before this election I was never called
any of those things protesters actually
right out here we shouted some facts and
they did they didn't have much else to
say the ranked white supremacist and all
this they just scream at you when you
try to talk to them they don't want
anything to do with you so nice to have
some intellectual debate but there was
none of that
so we smile we wave when we go I mean I
asked them do you think it makes it any
more likely that they're going to
reconsider their support of Donald Trump
if you call them affections well if you
want to debate like an adult or have an
adult conversation that's one thing but
if you want to scream at me when you
don't know me and tell me all these
things that you think about me what
makes that any better
facts are inherently not racist not
misogynistic facts just are so if facts
hurts your feelings you know you can do
something to try to try to maybe change
those facts but just you know calling
people names and shouting people down
because you don't agree with the facts
that's that's not intellectual it's not
a form of debate either make someone see
your point
either that just makes them not like the
other side even more okay let me just
make sure I understand the frog thing in
a laboratory they turn frogs gay right
not in the streams and rivers you don't
have to take the frogs gay so literally
but it was there was just a bit that he
did on the show and it was like water
where these frogs had had chemicals put
in there and they chose not to mate with
the female frogs they didn't need to
make a stop they stopped obeying their
biology did they mate with each other
the male frogs meet with each other now
that I'm not sure of like I said it was
he said it's making the frogs gay it
drew my attention to the study so it's
just one of those things it's like a
headliner and it's like a headline
that's how it's how he gets your
attention and then you can actually look
into the issue but like I said I don't
necessarily believe that frogs were
turning gay maybe they were just not
interested in the emails going on that
was changing their their their biology
to do this to do this to do this and it
completely flipped when the chemicals
got introduced and instead of anyone
looking into that it was just shot down
immediately because Alex Jones said it
or because it was on Infowars and I
think a lot of things there he
overreacts don't get me wrong because he
likes it a lot more than I do I think he
is sarcastic yeah it's an entertainment
thing mostly but effects are facts on
something certain things and if you can
debate those with me then that's great
but if you're just gonna scream because
it's not what you want to hear that
doesn't get anyone's message across that
doesn't do anything you know there's a
lot to say about that um I think that
there are some people as I mentioned
before who are TFG too far gone but I
don't I think that that percentage let's
say we go way over the top with it it's
25% or 30% of the country at most that
you can put in that category where you
can relatively safely say I don't think
I'm ever gonna change their mind no
matter how much I try to let them know
hey I'm for you I want you to thrive I
want you to be happy I wanted to have
the right policies in place that are
conducive to a quality life for you and
those people you know whatever you can
say some of them are uber fundamentalist
religious folks some of them are like
genuine open white supremacist and
things of that nature but I do think
that you know at the very least half
probably more than half of Trump
supporters are people that can be
reached if the if you do if you actually
care and you do an effective job to try
to sway them to your side and when you
look at these people it almost strikes
me as they
actually do want to be engaged and I
think it is fair to say that mainstream
media when it comes to somebody like
Alex Jones they put the cart before the
horse and so they start they do the
mocking first and then in the case of
CNN specifically they have like one
reporter whose whole purpose is trying
to get Infowars banned for more and more
platforms so when you put the mockery
first and then also one of your main
points is I'm just going my whole point
is gonna try to try to censor you and D
platform you I don't think people
realize that that comes across as very
weaselly like that comes across as like
oh you're almost like the schoolyard
bully now don't get me wrong um the
biggest opponent of Alex Jones that
there is and if you type in Alex Jones
secular talk to YouTube you're gonna get
a thousand videos with me basically
mocking Alex Jones but there's a
difference and I think it's a very key
difference what I try to do is play a
specific clip of Jones breakdown exactly
why what he's saying makes no sense so
there's the explanation first and then
the mockery and I think that if you go
about it that way people like Hootie
whitey is talking to here I think that
they're reasonable enough to go yeah you
know what on this particular one I'm not
sure I agree with Alex Jones what he
said is wrong for the reasons that were
just laid out so I think that that's
important I really do and I don't think
that that's something that's done nearly
enough I've always said not to toot my
own horn but just to show how I don't
think platform D platforming and Center
ship is effective I think that I've D
converted more Alex Jones fans than CNN
or any mainstream media outlet has in
their crusade to get info war censored
from all these different platforms
because I'm engaging with what they're
saying even when it happens to be super
ridiculous
I will debunk it and then I will go on
to mock them so I'm not above mocking
but I do think that engaging is more
important to deconstruct it to debunk it
to dissect it to explain why it's wrong
and then you could go and have your fun
macht and things of that nature now the
other thing is listen they bring up the
facts over feelings thing and of course
they got that from Ben Shapiro now dude
the whole point that people like me are
making is that not that we're saying Oh
facts you know your feelings are more
important than the facts no that's not
what we're saying
our counter-argument to Ben Shapiro is
oh you say facts / feelings but you
actually don't put facts / feelings so
that's our counterpoint I mean they make
it seem like the counterpoint is people
are saying no Ben Shapiro and other
right-wingers we want to put feelings
over the facts no what we're saying is
it actually is the case that he does not
put facts / feelings and indeed he does
put feelings over facts I mean the best
example of that is he said something on
Twitter the other day like Oh God exists
I'm gonna paraphrase here I'm not gonna
get it exactly right but something akin
to God exists outside of this dimension
outside of space and time and he's
always there on omnipotent yada yada and
I responded to and said what happened to
fax over feelings because you can't he
tries to have it both ways on that one
religion now that's about belief and
that's you know a it's I it logic God
something has to exist no it doesn't
that's not true that's not true and
that's just one example I mean we can go
into you know a belief in trickle-down
economics and how that just objectively
does not work and actually leads to it
hurts the middle class and it hurts the
poor and it the whole point is to you
know basically turn the economy over to
the rich let them do whatever the [ __ ]
they want let them get richer at the
expense of everybody else so you know we
can go issue for issue he was writing
articles about how the Iraq war is great
and it's a wonderful idea and what what
about that is fact so her feeling she's
all about facts over feelings there
that's an offensive war against a
country that didn't attack us that's a
fact
that's me putting facts over feelings or
the war in Iraq was an illegal war
according to the UN according the
international law it was an offensive
war against a country that didn't attack
us he's writing article
saying the Iraq war is great but he's
putting facts over but he's not putting
facts over her feelings he wrote
articles talking about the gay agenda
but the [ __ ] you mean the gay agenda and
again these are people who I don't think
these are bad people because they go on
later on and when they the issue of
homosexuality gets brought up in the
context of people they're kind of like I
live and let live it's whatever
yeah but then to do that you're looking
at and you're idolizing you know like
ben shapiro with the facts or her
feelings thing he's he's deeply opposed
to gay marriage he you know again wrote
these articles about oh the nefarious
gay agenda is taking over and it's like
so listen i think that ultimately
there's a lot of blame to go around here
because I do think that like people like
these counter protesters at this Trump
event where they're they're screaming no
Trump no KKK no fascist USA and they're
like just shouting down the people going
into the Trump rally don't get me wrong
I think there is a place in time for
protest and but I think the whole idea
of protest is you go after the people in
the government or you go after people
the people on Wall Street who rigged the
economy or the military industrial
complex so you go to them and you talk
about specific things
hey we're protesting for a $15 minimum
wage we're protesting for Medicare for
all we're protesting to end the wars
we're protesting to close Guantanamo Bay
or whatever it may be those I think are
protests that are totally legitimate and
I'll lead those protests but what well
if you're just lining up outside of a
trump rally and you're just screaming at
the people who are going to the Trump
rally not only is does that not make
sense you're actively hurting the causes
you claim to care about because what's
gonna happen is exactly what happens
with these people where they'll get out
there and they'll give these interviews
and they're like hey listen man I'm
waiting to engage with people I'm
waiting to have a conversation with
people let's have a conversation but
they don't want to have a conversation I
want to shout at me and call me racist
when I'm walking into this rally so I
actually think there's a important point
there of there is a place in time for
protest but I think if you're gonna go
protest the same people who you're gonna
turn around in the next election and say
oh by the way can you maybe vote for the
candidate that I support they're not
gonna support your candidate if you
[ __ ] screaming at them calling them a
racist outside of a rally so you know in
my mind you have to engage and there are
many instances where you can actually
get the vote of somebody for your
preferred candidate if you're willing to
be honest and have an open discussion
and and tell the truth and not
immediately judge them as a bad person
per se that's not me saying there aren't
bad people at Trump rallies I just told
you there are some too far-gone people
who might actually [ __ ] legit be in
the KKK or what-have-you
totally Zuri that happens but most of
them are not that and you could probably
reach many of them but step one is you
don't just scream in their faces they're
walking into the rally you try to engage
with them so I don't know maybe um I
think some people might watch this
segment call me naive I don't know maybe
but I think that the fact that there's
what was it tens of thousands of people
who voted for Obama twice and then voted
for Trump and all you needed was tent up
whatever 70,000 people maybe more to
vote for Hillary in the last election to
win because the Rust Belt was really
where she lost it and it was just
because she lost the Rust Belt she lost
the election so I think that if you
focus on the people that are get Abul I
think you can win and you could win
pretty easily so maybe I'm naive and
maybe whoever dissents on this video is
right but that's my sense of it and I
think that when I see an interview like
that I don't walk away from that saying
that these people are in that too
far-gone camp I don't I walk away from
it and I think like if only you know
they saw effective debunking of the
people who they watch like alex jones
and ben shapiro if only they had
stumbled across a secular talk video
where i break that down if only they had
somebody who's on the Left who was
willing to kind of walk them through
certain things I think they could very
easily have been on the left and not on
the right and maybe there's still hope
for them now so that's my take on it and
I'm curious what everybody else thinks
hello [ __ ] yeah
holla at you boys I was just telling you
I upgraded my skype and knock on wood
everything went [ __ ] perfect like
they asked me for an administrative name
and password and I tried a couple times
like I got rejected but then after maybe
like the fourth try got it
it [ __ ] like updated it was like you
want to update this I was like sure
didn't ask me another password and now
this [ __ ] looks like a brand new pair of
Jordans you used to have to like ask to
be somebody's friend or something before
you could call them and now they got rid
of that yeah I saw a weird message it
was like from like core Anita or some
[ __ ] and it was like are you interested
in doing this and I was like how did you
even send me a message yeah used to be
you had to like reach out to the person
and get accepted and now they decided
like oh no just make it like you could
call whoever you want I'm always
skeptical of like how these accounts so
I mainly use Instagram and for some
reason if I'm like watching porn or
something like that I'll get all these
random accounts like friending me so I
mean like how is it just like a bot that
has like these like weird algorithms
that will somehow just friend me or
something because they can't be real
accounts of course it could be real
accounts people probably know you
through the through this podcast and
then they try to Mel but it's like it's
like weird accounts it's like some are
fake some are like a name with mad
numbers at the end of it like [ __ ] day I
could tell if someone's real from the
show trying to like maybe friend me on
Instagram or something so you're like a
hundred percent sure it's all fake one
thousand yeah for sure
well that happens sometimes on Twitter
that happens to where like when I
started getting a bunch of followers
sprinkled in with the bunch of real new
followers would always be some obviously
fake [ __ ] mm-hmm so I think maybe that
happens like if you get let's say you
get like three or four genuine new
followers in a day that then you might
get some BOTS or something too but what
is the there
only be bad things associated with that
right like there's no I have no idea to
be honest with you like what goes on I
know that there are like there were
scandals of like Mitt Romney and Newt
Gingrich and a bunch of these
politicians like buying followers on
Twitter like that was a scandal and like
I think there are companies that do that
but you could always track it because
what happened was and this is how they
figured it out and when they tracked
like Newt Gingrich's followers he got a
giant spike in followers they all came
from like the same place and like India
or some [ __ ] yeah so yeah you buy from a
company and that's what happens but in
terms of outside of that like I don't
know why there are BOTS and what they're
doing but they're they're out there I
could see the reasoning behind I know
there's a lot of them I like I know this
clothing company in New York that they
make hot clothing like it's dope mom but
when you go into a meeting with someone
now like social media is huge so like
you can be like we have you know 6,000
followers on Instagram and like our
photos are getting thousands of likes
when in reality I mean I know people
that on genuine photos um it'll have
like seven likes or something like that
but then you know a couple hours later
you'll see like 670 and I'm just like
huh and then you click on the thing
because you could see who likes photos
and it's all these weird accounts like
also they're buying it they're probably
buying buying likes and - my point is I
spoke to someone who was in a position
of like having a meeting with one of
these companies like the clothing
companies and she was an older lady but
she had no idea she was like oh their
photos get like 700 likes and you know
they have this amount of followers we
weren't in reality and you broke it down
yeah no one's looking at their [ __ ] and
she was like wow I didn't even realize
that like they have Fayette thing so
it's like I could see a startup company
doing that so people are like wow
they're pretty popular but yeah like one
company I don't get it well I have like
a hundred and a hundred and twenty some
odd thousand Twitter followers and
there's a certain number of like
guaranteed retweets and likes when you
have that many legit followers you know
what I mean so I've seen people that
have more followers than me but they
have much less activity
their account like they'll get two
retweets for a tweet and they have like
double the number of followers I have
and that's how you know that they bought
followers but then also there are people
who get legit like deals for just for
being popular online like all these
makeup girls on YouTube yeah they get
free makeup and then all day that you
know that there's a word for them that
all influencers or some [ __ ] what
they're called now it's like a new
profession yeah so it's weird because I
feel like every single like so there are
some Gulf youtubers who I I watched some
of their stuff and they ended up getting
like legit clothing deals and I think
maybe even a club deal with one of them
where like they're golfers if you're a
golfer on the PGA Tour like a golf
company like Callaway or Titleist or
Nike from back in the day even though
they stopped making clubs like a golf
tailor-made like they'll reach out to
these people they'll pay them a certain
amount of money and they have to play
their golf clubs play their golf ball
and then wear their clothes if it's a
clothing company to and like these golf
youtubers now they're getting deals too
so that tells me that the golf industry
is actually like a little bit they're
like kind of forward-looking in that
sense where they see all social media
stars can have a decent amount of
influence and then like I said with the
makeup girls same thing they'll get free
makeup and then but it also makes you
skeptical of their opinion out yeah
their opinion because that's your old
point it's just like all right like he's
given them gear and [ __ ] and clubs or
whatever mother should yeah if they do a
review they're biased gonna be biased in
favor logs like it will say [ __ ] you
we're not sending you any more [ __ ] all
right
that actually happened with one of them
one of them this guy had a Chloe with I
think it was Titleist The Golf Company
and then one of the other companies were
like we're not sending you our clubs to
review anymore because he used to get
free clubs from everybody to review he's
like we're not gonna send it to you
because you have a deal with Titleist so
you're gonna be biased against us right
up front so I think all that stuff is so
interesting and what's funny is like so
for what I do
I'm not above like if I like a certain
clothing company and I don't see any
ethical problems with that clothing
company like if I think like everything
they're doing is ethical and they're a
good company I wouldn't I wouldn't be
above wearing a shirt if a company
wanted me to wear it you know what I
mean so if you genuinely liked it though
but I have to genuinely like it and I
would have to be convinced that there's
no ethical problems with the company and
the funny thing is Dane would never it's
funny because even though I have a legit
like you know my my listeners are
awesome you guys are awesome like so I
think it would actually be a good thing
for a cart company to do but they're not
even interested they're they they're
interested they're just dumb as [ __ ]
like that celtic company that sent you
seltzer
that was juice it's one thing I got yes
so let me for let me tell the story for
everybody doesn't know because there are
people who probably have just come to
this show later on and they don't know
about hashtag big Seltzer but so what
happened was there was a segment I was
doing one day and in the middle of a
segment I legitimately like had
something either stuck in my throat or I
was coughing like something legit where
it was bad and so I said like hold on
and then I reached and picked up my
drink and drank it and then put it back
down and then I noticed oh I'm drinking
seltzer cuz that's pretty much all I
drink and then I held it up and I was
like this isn't a paid ad but and
whatever shelter was polar or vintage
whatever was I was like but he was
vintage right yeah vintage seltzer yeah
selling now and now I can remember the
[ __ ] that they sent you well yeah you're
right I really shouldn't know that but
anyway so I like smiled and held the
thing and put it down and a listener to
the show on Twitter took that clip sent
it to the the the Seltzer company on
Twitter and was like hey have you guys
seen this you should probably hook him
up with a deal and then that company
responded and was like you're right
we're gonna do that and I was like wait
what the [ __ ] going on here and then
it was dead legit reached out to me and
they were like hey we want to send you
like a thank-you package I was like what
the [ __ ] and so they sent me I honestly
I don't know if it was vintage or polar
I don't know which one it was I think it
was vintage
for I think it was Vincent you have a
shirt - yeah they sent a shirt and they
sent um like had the flavors that were
discontinued even so I mean the
discontinued shit's which is sort of
official they were like it was like
pineapple something and scenario right
they were they were super bangin to
taste something so d even though it
wasn't soda
but anyway so but that was the only
thing anybody's ever sent me and then
what's funny is that still stuck because
I did a segment after and I was like I
sold out guys hashtag big Seltzer
sellout and then that took over on its
own and now it calls me the Seltzer
sellout and there's something to it I
mean I'm [ __ ] drinking seltzer right
now [ __ ] yeah but but you genuinely like
sell to like I mean I drink it all the
time yeah regarde before that happened I
would drink it all it's all I drink I'm
not gonna knock um
cui tee but I'm gonna knock their [ __ ] a
little bit if that's allowed on this
channel
no bad you're not allowed to say
anything negative about them please god
but when we were out there it was like
you guys did a segment and in the middle
of the segment they realized that like a
mug for some [ __ ] law firm or some
weird bank wasn't on the set and I was
almost like what the [ __ ] like you know
like did that really happen I don't
remember yeah yeah they like they
brushed a mug on to the set midway
through or something like that and then
after the segment I think genk like
plugged it or something like that and I
sort of was like I just remember him
doing an ad I don't remember all it was
for mm-hmm it was like some Bank or
something like that but in the middle of
this segment he realized or one of the
producers realized that the mug wasn't
sitting in front of his notes or some
[ __ ] like that and it was just like
it was too much and you start to see
that like you know it's unnecessary if
you had a weird you know thing over your
shoulder or something it would just be
unnecessary like like people like you
just cuz it's raw it's like there's
nobody that is is like [ __ ]
contaminating your waters and it's just
like once you see that [ __ ] or you get a
like you know you get a plug after is
his show and you're just like no I
didn't need that you know well they do
that they have an ad team now and
they'll do like like they'll play a
little recorded ad that they do before
video whether it's like 15 seconds or
whatever and I think you know for me I
would have to love that product so much
that I honestly couldn't wait to share
it with everybody in order for me to do
something like that because I'm not a
fan of like putting it in every segment
I think that's like that's asking a lot
like you want a 50
excuse me a 15 second thing before a
video is like damn you're robbing 15
seconds from the people you know and
especially if you are putting your stamp
on it if you're the one who's promoting
it hardcore you have to fully believe in
that product now to be fair to TYT I
think I know the thing you're talking
about the the bank thing you're talking
about and actually the whole point of
that bank is like they divested from all
fossil fuels they dive out so like it's
supposed to be like a very left-wing
bank so that's not it to be fair to them
to give them credit but yeah I agree
with you that yeah that's not like to
interrupt in the middle of something to
do up an ad or to have product placement
yeah that feels weird but then again
like I said if I really like like a
clothing company and and they were
ethical or whatever and they wanted to
do to have some sort of deal I'm not
above that I would consider but then
again I mean I see all these sports
athletes and you hear other athletes
critiquing them on TV and they'll talk
about like hey well you can get it get
it
so like you'll see like a rod when he
was young was doing weird commercials or
magazine shoots like kissing a mirror
with his shirt off and dude just doing
weird [ __ ] so it's like if you could if
you can get that money like or you can
get that at at what point again it
depends what company I think that Matt
like if it's one of the if like [ __ ]
a big bank comes up to me and ask me to
do something like for like a rifle
company or some [ __ ] like you're the
reason the economy crashed it [ __ ]
like I've seen you know whatever Capital
One commercials and Jennifer Garner or
whoever is in it and it's like yo don't
like your that these are that's not a
good company they haven't done like
they're really [ __ ] up it's really
[ __ ] up to like push them you know
what I mean so there's varying degrees
of what is reasonable and what
not reasonable in terms of unbelievable
- like when shacks [ __ ] and trying to
fit his ass in a Buick or some [ __ ]
you're just like this [ __ ] just
trying to get money he is on every
single [ __ ] atom ya know Shaq I like
Shaq on a personal level but the thing
that annoys me about him is I remember
back he was doing literally like land
deals or some creepy [ __ ] some sketchy
[ __ ] with Chris Christie Governor Chris
Christie Shaq was yes he was in some
sort of real estate deal or something
and I was like yo yeah Shaq is like I
mean when somebody says sold out that
like his pictures in the dictionary
under sell out like he will promote
anything for any reason at all just
unscrupulous and how he does it you know
I miss [ __ ] in commercials with
the general like do you really [ __ ]
needs car insurance like he's probably
got personal drivers and all this [ __ ]
like and the general [ __ ] the general
man I want him to come after me if he's
a real dude out there because they're a
[ __ ] fake company because I needed
car insurance and I called the general I
was like they were like wolf [ __ ] give
car insurance to anybody and this was
when I was a team and I just gotten in a
car accident or something like that and
I was like no car insurance would give
me company State Farm whatever else is
out there
state farms the only one I could think
of or L um what's the orbits or some
[ __ ] I don't know the girl well long
story short I call progressive general
aggressive progressive I called the
general and all it does is tell you
every single car insurance company like
it's not an actual car so it's it's a
consolidation site where they give you
the prices of all the other ones yeah
but like on the commercial it makes like
their own [ __ ] yeah for the West has the
jingle go for the best low rate you
could go to the say sometime yeah
there's so many who's just singing
jingles the other day I'm so pissed off
Koren listening to like there are there
are commercials where the music I hear
the commercial so much and so I hear the
music from the commercial so much that I
want to [ __ ] break [ __ ] almost to the
point where I would consider if I was
president I would consider a ban on
jingles music in
commercials like did you know they
actually had a law that said you can't
for the commercial make it go louder
than what the show is yeah I heard that
yeah the FCC had some sort of rule like
you can't do that because what they do
is the companies were like what if they
woke up go to the bathroom I want to
hear it and so they made a make it's
like double the [ __ ] volume and
that's [ __ ] up and I don't think they
should do that and I feel like that
about [ __ ] songs now like there's
that there's that commercial for I
forget what car it is but they mix that
Havana song the yeah Havana they mix
that with oh don't I don't know what
it's like more commercial but I hear it
all the [ __ ] time and I'm like yo
stop with the first time I heard this
commercial I was like oh that's kind of
hot that they mix those two songs and
I've heard that [ __ ] commercial three
thousand times and I'm mute it every
time it comes on there's that there used
to be a I think pitbull was in some like
Verizon commercial wrapping to like and
there was some catchy number of this
other of the phone number to call or
something Selena won Barnes been at the
game for a minute there [ __ ] with the
Cellino and Barnes and I like Robeson
oil that jingle is [ __ ] classic which
one is that
Oh Oh son are you kidding me I'm gonna
play this [ __ ] right now hard body but
like I mean they've done their job that
they've like gotten their [ __ ] jingle
out there and I've heard some Cellino
and Barnes so many times but I know that
their injury attorneys and I would never
call them but God forbid I needed an
injury attorney I [ __ ] know Selena and
Barnes only people in the Northeast are
gonna know this commercial when I play
it okay this is okay I got to find the
right one there's so many [ __ ] weird
commercials out there you'll know this
when you hear
this jingles hot it gets better that's
like the Michael Jackson beat right I
don't know about that you got a friend
in Robeson all you that's it's a banger
though got a friend of all time I never
got tired of that jingle that's the one
I was like hot on that's a good one the
1-800 cars for kids the ones for kids
I want cars for kids the [ __ ] that
pisses me off the most and it happens
every [ __ ] morning when I'm home is
the lady
it's those like um she smoked cigarettes
and she's like I never lost anything
before except this and she [ __ ] moves
her thing and there's a big-ass hole in
her throat and I'm like eating my eggs
and I'm like oh yeah all those channel
every single time yeah it's [ __ ] up
cuz they work to like work how would
that not work that's like someone like a
mint don't [ __ ] have sex we're all
look at my dick and like his dick is
just all like like disgusting you'd be
like oh my god I'm never doing what you
did ever again like those commercials
are powerful man oh it's like I've been
Jake Tapper did the most grossly
misleading so-called fact check
inaccurate fact check of all time so
let's watch this and then I'll break it
down for you hey everybody its Jake
Tapper from CNN's State of the Union and
factcheck.org and this week we're gonna
take a look at a claim made by two
self-identified Democratic socialists
Vermont independent senator Bernie
Sanders and New York congressional
candidate Alexandria Acacio Cortez they
say that a study funded by the
billionaire Koch brothers who are
generally I think it's fair to say
libertarians and conservatives that the
medicare-for-all proposal would actually
save the government money let me thank
the Koch brothers of all people for
sponsoring a study that shows that
Medicare for all would save the American
people two trillion dollars of lakenya
it shows that Medicare for all is
actually much more it is actually much
cheaper than the current system that we
pay right now is that true did a study
funded by the Koch brothers indicate
that Medicare for all would actually
save the US government trillions of
dollars no it's not true at least not
according to the author of the study the
study in question is a working paper
from the Mercatus Center at George Mason
University that looked at the ten-year
impact of senator Sanders proposed
Medicare for all plans now while it's
true that the Koch brothers have given
millions of dollars to the Mercatus
Center at George Mason University and an
AP investigation earlier this year
suggested that the Koch brothers do have
control and influence over the hiring
and firing of professors we should know
for whatever it's worth the authors of
the study said the Koch brothers did not
influence them in any way we asked
senator Sanders spokesperson he told us
that while the study says Medicare for
all would increase the federal budget by
roughly 32 trillion dollars it also says
that the projected cost of all
healthcare expenditures in the u.s.
would drop by two trillion dollars the
study's author says that that two
trillion dollar drop is not actually his
conclusion he said that's based on
assumptions made by senator
sandurz fact he wrote quote it is likely
that the actual cost of Medicare for all
would be substantially greater than
these estimates which assumes
significant administrative and drug cost
savings under the plan and also assumed
that health care providers operating
under Medicare for all will be
reimbursed it rates more than 40 percent
lower than those currently paid by
private health insurance in fact he lays
out an alternate scenario that does not
include savings from provider payment
cuts and in that scenario the report
says that there would be a net increase
in healthcare spending
now we're not here to make a judgement
on the viability of Medicare for all and
we have no idea if the Koch brothers
influenced the writing of this Merc a
dissenter study but it does seem pretty
clear that the presentation being made
by senator bernie sanders and alexandria
Acacio cortez about this study lacks a
lot of context and the author of the
study says they are not being accurate a
reminder to all you politicians out
there you're perfectly entitled to your
own opinions not to your own facts I'm
Jake Tapper from CNN's State of the
Union and fact check that or what a
perfectly smug way to end such an
incredibly misleading and wrong segment
so let's break this down because there
are from what I can take away from this
there are two giant issues here and Jake
Tapper is either misleading you on
purpose which is possible or he's just
so much of a nuance and and technicality
troll that he actually thinks he's
correct here which is actually a hard
thing to digest because once I tell you
his points here and the crux of the
disagreement you're gonna go oh really
that's how he interpreted this so the
first thing is the claim that he's
fact-checking that Alexandria Ocasio
Cortes and Bernie Sanders allegedly made
they didn't make this claim is that Oh
it will save Medicare for all will save
the government two trillion dollars
that is not what they said that's not
what they said at all you added the word
government if you go back go back and
listen to exactly what Bernie Sanders
said he played the [ __ ] clip of what
Bernie Sanders said Bernie said Medicare
for all will quote save the American
people two trillion dollars see Jake
there's a reason why he said the
American people and not the government
he said the American people because he
means the American people will save two
trillion dollars so in other words if
you take your private premium and you
say oh I'm not going to pay I don't need
to pay my private premium anymore
because now I do we have universal
health care in this country and it comes
out of my tax dollars well yes your
taxes might go up to get that health
care from the government but your net
saving money because your your private
premium now no longer exists you don't
have to pay it and you were paying more
in the private premium so do you
understand that that's very important
Bernie's argument is Oh take your
private premium throw it out the window
you ought to pay it anymore there's no
unnecessary rapacious for-profit
middleman there that's [ __ ] you and
price gouging you get rid of your
private premium yes pay more in taxes
but get your health care through the
government but you're still not going to
be paying as much as you were before
because your private premium was way
more expensive than whatever the
increase in your taxes is gonna be but
Jake Tapper takes Bernie Sanders saying
Oh Medicare for all will save the
American people two trillion dollars he
pretends like Bernie Sanders said
Medicare for all will save the
government two trillion dollars and then
he goes well that's incorrect Bernie
you're entitled to your own opinions
you're not entitled to your own facts
of course Medicare fraud would not save
the government two trillion dollars guys
this video has about 75% of the people
that watched it disliked it I mean that
is it is a stunning ratio it is like
whoa nobody likes this video because
even people who aren't like big Bernie
supporters were like yeah you're not
fact-checking this properly you're being
incredibly misleading he didn't say what
you think he said or
what you say he said and you're wrong
and then people on Twitter we're calling
him out over this and being respectful
to and saying oh I think you made a
mistake and they went back and they
changed like one or two things but they
kept the segment up and and the general
idea that that Oh Bernie is wrong but
he's not wrong
now the other thing is they're assuming
in this fact-check like oh we what if we
keep the private rates and have the
government like basically have the
funding flip instead of private funding
but it will be public funding of the
private rates that's the other trick
he's doing so when you put it like that
of course you're gonna say the
government is not gonna save money and
even the people under that scenario
wouldn't save money but why would you
have under a medicare-for-all system the
private rates being paid that makes
absolutely no sense because the private
rates include the profit margin include
the grossly higher administrative costs
which would not exist anymore or it
would be way more efficient when you go
to switch to a Medicare for All system
because we already know the Medicare
administrative costs are significantly
lower than the private health insurance
company administrative costs that's a
fact we already know that so for you to
act like oh we are gonna have tax money
so public money paying the private rates
Jake it's hard for me to think that you
didn't do this on purpose
because that is such a disgusting Mis
reading of a situation that it's almost
laughably stupid that you would even
think for a second that that's how the
system would work this reminds me of I
think it was the Washington Post they
did this to Bernie
during the election in the primary when
it was him versus Hillary they ran an
article about how oh my god it's so
unworkable and it's so stupid
now you're talking about Medicare for
all now how did they come back
conclusion get this guys they added on
top of our current health care spending
what a medicare-for-all system would
cost so they say
the private system it would still be the
private system would still exist as it
does right now there would still be the
price gouging in that system there would
still be the sky-high administrative
costs and we're gonna add on top of our
private spending the cost of a
medicare-for-all system and pretend like
Bernie's proposal is we have both of
those systems existing simultaneously
and then we're gonna take that total
number and lambaste Bernie for it and
say oh you're so stupid so many
trillions of dollars your system and
again anybody who read that and isn't
just a casual observer would go that
makes no [ __ ] sense he's not saying
keep our private system exactly the way
it is and then add on top of it to
Medicare for All system of course not
he's saying you reform the system you
get rid of the private system as it
currently exists you have a Medicare for
All system and you have supplemental
private care which is different so it is
it's so misleading and by the way again
here's why I think he might be
purposefully misleading people does Jake
Tapper unaware that in other every other
developed country they have one version
or another of a single-payer system and
those countries cover everybody and pay
significantly less than we do are you is
he unaware of that does Jake Tapper not
know about the Canadian system or the UK
system or the Australian system or the
system in any of the Scandinavian
countries is he unaware is Jake Tapper
that ignorant of what other developed
countries are doing no of course he
knows so then how can you make this
segment it's it's a matter of objective
fact we already know they pay
significantly less in some instances
half of what we pay and they cover
everybody and they have better health
outcomes so how do you do this segment
with a straight face somehow the United
States is unable to do exactly what
other developed countries have done for
decades get the [ __ ] out here this is
disgusting corporate propaganda it's so
it's so grossly off-base and by the way
even that murkiness study I think is
[ __ ] I think it's [ __ ] because
even though he mentions like oh they say
they weren't impacted by where the money
came from right sure in the same way
that if there's a [ __ ] tobacco funded
study on whether or not people get lung
cancer from tobacco
yeah there's no impact sure they're
being funded by the big tobacco people
they're not going to skew it in that
direction but that's the point is it
it's obviously [ __ ]
I read you guys the analysis before on
the show I've covered the article if you
extrapolate over the next ten years the
private system that we have it would
cost 49 trillion dollars for our health
care 49 trillion if you scrap that
system and do Medicare for all that
would cost 32 trillion and change so
we're talking about a saving of savings
of 17 trillion dollars I think that that
number is way more accurate I think
that's closer to reality than the two
trillion over a decade but see how the
how they they change the debate and the
conversation and they shift the
goalposts way to the right this is the
old Overton Window trick let's shift the
goalposts of the discussion so far to
the right that we're no longer having a
conversation about what's real anymore
so let's pretend like oh the two sides
of the ward debate are hey we should go
bomb and invade even more countries on
top of the eight countries we're already
bombing and open more military bases on
top of our nine hundred military bases
and the left-wing position is oh no I
don't like that idea
why don't we only bomb seven countries
and do it more with drones than fighter
jets so they set that up is like oh
that's that's the spectrum of debate
that's acceptable and reasonable and
anybody who's saying hey I think we
should pull out of all those countries
that were bombing oh you crazy far left
the idiot [ __ ] so then when I step up
and ice point out the thing that I think
is closer to reality based on the
numbers that we've seen in previous
analyses that oh I think Medicare for
all over a decade would save seventeen
trillion dollars they go oh legend
[ __ ] crazy [ __ ] idiot you
communist pinko loser
[ __ ] [ __ ] are you talking you know math
your letter to mouth nor do you even
understand basic economics bro so but
that's that's the reality of the
situation because now you get the people
on CNN oh I get paid millions of dollars
a year to do fake fact checks and we're
tie yes that's what I do
but he's effectively changed the debate
and the conversation now too
Berni a liar or is he not a liar when he
says medicare-for-all saves money cuz it
doesn't that's now the conversation
we're having when that is so far away
from the truth that it's mind-boggling
so [ __ ] you Jake Tapper you're pathetic
you're terrible at your [ __ ] job man
that's what you are the other day he did
this thing you know Donald Trump signed
a gross and obscene defense bill that's
717 billion dollars it's an increase of
over a hundred billion dollars in our
defense spending Jake Tapper goes out
there and does the segment does he go
after Trump and and the the Democrats
and say why are you adding I think it's
like thirteen new warships why why would
you do that when our infrastructure gets
a grade of D plus and it's crumbling why
would you send 8 billion dollars to
create a [ __ ] space force are you
kidding me we have people we have
homeless people in this country or is
gonna spend money on a space force we
already spend more than the next 10
biggest countries combined what are you
doing
what a stupid I thought the Democrats
said that Trump is beholden to Putin
he's a Manchurian Candidate and now
you're gonna give that guy a hundred
billion dollars more for his own army
are you [ __ ] crazy instead of going
out there and saying that what did he do
mr. president at the signing of this
defense bill named after John McCain you
didn't show due deference to John McCain
how dare you sir so we're gonna take
time out on this wonderful show to tell
you how great John McCain is thank you
for your service John McCain yes that's
what Jake Tapper does he serves
corporate power he serves the
establishment and he he puts on a
serious face and wears the ties you're
supposed to think
he's a straight shooter he's not a
straight shooter this is the opposite of
straight shooting this is [ __ ]
propaganda that serves the interests of
for-profit health insurance companies
and I think he's smart enough to know
that which makes it even worse
Elizabeth Warren went on Seth Meyers
show and she showed her weaknesses here
since she plans on she overwhelmingly
likely plans on running for president in
2020 you're gonna see how there are some
instances where substantively she's not
as strong as she should be but also not
as strong as she should be when it comes
to messaging let's take a look
it does seem as though one of the things
when you talk about how the rich are
being taken care of money is obviously
playing a huge role in politics and I
feels that the Democratic Party also has
to answer for the large amounts of
corporate money they've taken over the
years you don't take corporate PAC money
but do you think that the Democratic
Party has to take a stronger stand
against taking corporate money or is
that just the price of doing business
so look I've been worried for a very
long time about the impact of money in
Washington you know money just doesn't
talk in Washington it shouts it screams
it commands but let's never lose sight
of the fact that the Trump
administration is the most corrupt
administration in our lifetime and think
about example after example that right
now the Saudis can funnel money directly
indirectly into Trump's pockets through
the Trump Hotel that the head of the
Environmental Protection Agency is a
coal lobbyist and can I tell you about
Gary Koch sure go for it yeah so here's
the deal so Trump is setting up Trump is
setting up his administration this year
and a half ago he's setting up his
administration he brings all these
goldman sachs guys i swear to you they
could have opened a branch office of
goldman sachs right there in the white
house it should be noted this is the
same goldman sachs that donald trump
railed against hillary clinton for
giving paid speeches - exactly that one
okay so he brings in these goldman sachs
people but one of them was very special
Gary Cohn is was a major executive at
goldman sachs and he is going to be the
special adviser to the president
economic advisor to help get the tax
laws
change so goldman-sachs gives Gary cone
a little gift on the way out a third of
a billion dollars I think of it as a
sort of pre bribe and then Gary cone
goes off and writes the tax laws helps
Ram them through Congress and goldman
sachs makes billions of dollars off the
change in the tax laws let's call this
out for what it is
corruption pure and simple mention you
mentioned the saudis i also want to ask
this because i feel like we are so we
tend to get so focused on what's
happening in DC and what specifically
happening with this presidency you wrote
a letter today i believe to the
commander Central Command about this
horrific bombing in Yemen a bombing that
killed civilians killed children this is
Saudi this is the UAE but it is US
backed in that munitions in that
refueling and intelligence can you
explain a little about what you asked
for in that letter sure so this is an
unfolding humanitarian crisis and the
United States is not dropping bombs but
it is helping the Saudis with arms it's
helping the Saudis with refueling and it
now appears it's helping the Saudis
target and pennpoint I think that if the
United States is going to be that
directly involved in a humanitarian
crisis then the American people have a
right to know exactly what's going on so
as I've talked about before
I think it's relatively clear that
Elizabeth Warren is the second best
senator that we have and obviously
Bernie's number one and I don't want to
act like she's like the you know the
cadre of corporate Democrats because she
is better and we should give credit
where credit is due I don't think any of
the the hardcore corporate Democrats
would have ever come up with the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and
prodded Obama
to add that to dodd-frank that's exactly
what Elizabeth Warren did so she does
deserve credit too you know for being
better than the stable of corporate
Democrats that pretty much run the show
in Washington DC now having said that
this clip really does demonstrate the
the good side and the bad side of
Elizabeth Warren
so her answer on the corruption part
money in politics was actually very good
if you just subtract one part so she
talks about okay she doesn't take
corporate PAC money great that's
wonderful hundred percent support that
that's the way it should be
um and she gives a great detailed
breakdown of just how corrupt Donald
Trump is taking the Saudi money for
example talking about how he brought
Goldman Sachs into the administration
even though you know he was railing
against Goldman Sachs on the campaign
trail totally support that kind of
argument because that's not something
you hear other Democrats say but it's
totally true because other Democrats
want that Goldman Sachs money so they're
not gonna bring that up because they
know that if they're in ever in a
position where they're running for
president they gladly take that money so
that's all fine and dandy
the part that I object to is and this is
distinctly anti Bernie in the framework
here because what would Bernie say
Bernie would say everything Elizabeth
Warren just said and he would take out
the part about oh but we have to
remember this is the worst
Administration when it comes to
corruption now why am i against that
it's actually true I think that's true
when you look at the numbers but at the
same time
Bernie makes a point of saying no as a
matter of principle I'm against the
corrupting influence of big money in
politics so it's the Democrats and it's
the Republicans so he doesn't do this
thing where it's like oh yeah I'm
against the money but obviously they're
worse he doesn't do that he takes a
principled stand against money in
politics he's you know he'll take the
small dollar donations he won't take
corporate PAC money but he also Bernie
rails against the Democratic Party and
says hey they're failing and they're not
what they should be and you know they
need to
their own house in order to win in the
next election razzle is Elizabeth Warren
you get a sense that there's a little
bit more of a deflection and there's a
little bit more obfuscation there where
she talks about money in politics but
she does want to take the spotlight off
of the corruption when the Democrats do
it so it's that answer was not terrible
I want to be clear because she did hit
many important talking points that I
always say the Democrats should bring up
about exactly how Donald Trump is
corrupt with Goldman Sachs and she
brings up the Saudi money and all that
stuff that's all fine and dandy
but I think that her approval rating
would skyrocket if she instead of doing
the okay yeah it's bad but they're worse
if she didn't do that because I don't
Bernie everything I've seen of Bernie he
doesn't really do that he just says like
yeah no I'm against the big money and
the Democrats need to stop taking it and
obviously the Republicans are bad but
the Democrats need to stop taking it and
we're bad too and remember the question
from Seth Meyers was hey should the
Democrats stop taking corporate money
you know should that be a bigger thing
among Democrats and her answer was to
say I'm against all the money but the
Republicans are worse no that's it
that's a situation where okay if you ask
Bernie that question or if you ask me
that question
my response is yes the Democrats should
stop taking less money
excuse me the Democrats should stop
taking corporate money and they should
go you know only take small dollar
donations and then if you still want to
go on to give you know the specifics
about how corrupt Trump is that's great
but you know if you're really being open
and honest you also throw in examples
like okay debbie Wasserman Schultz
here's how corrupt she is she took X
amount of money from the predatory
payday loan industry or Hillary Clinton
obviously she's not going to do that
because she ended up backing Hillary
Clinton but that's the thing is I don't
like it we're like she's right on the
overall point but she's playing hide the
ball with the details where it's like
okay yeah no totally
stop taking corporate money but they're
worse so let's focus more on them no
let's focus on everybody and have like
let's just as a matter of principle say
no corporate PAC money and every
Democrat
on board with that but she would never
say every Democrat should get on board
with that because she wants to hold
hands and sing Kumbaya with the
Democratic establishment which of course
is the exact wrong thing for her to do
if she really wants to you know do well
in 2020 I've always said about Elizabeth
Warren I think she has wonderful
instincts but the instincts are beaten
out of her by shitty corporate
Democratic strategists and my the best
example of that I think is when she came
out she flat-out said after we got after
you know I think it was the Donna
Brazile revelation and she was like oh
yeah the Bernie people were right in the
primary was kind of rigged and then
Elizabeth Warren went on TV and she was
asked hey what do you think about this
and she said yeah the primary was ranked
and then the host was shocked it was
like really you're gonna use that word
she's like yeah rigged but then within a
week she was out a backpedaling and
saying oh no did I say rigged maybe
that's a little bit too strong of a word
I think what I should have said is and
you know that my whole point was no you
were right I I know what happened in
that situation she got behind closed
doors with a bunch of democratic
strategist after she did that interview
and it blew up and they were like you
can't say that go back out there and
change it because if that sticks then
then you're not gonna have a chance in
2020 and it's like no you had it exactly
backwards she was right the first time
which is why it made news and why it was
important and then when you backpedaled
it came across as weak and also
sniveling lying because you were clearly
doing a Machiavellian political
calculation which you shouldn't have
done okay putting all that aside now
let's get to the other portion of the
answer so Elizabeth Warren um one of
very few Democrats is probably her and
Bernie and maybe just a handful of
others who are like oh [ __ ] what's
happening in Yemen is [ __ ] up son this
should stop so she wrote you know a
meanly worded letter to whoever saying
oh come on with this this is bad I'm
against this this is but don't massacre
children thank you very much but instead
of outright saying we should cease all
arms and funding to Saudi Arabia
we should sanction them we should kick
them off the the UN Human Rights
instead of saying any of that stuff what
does she say I think the American people
have a right to know exactly what their
tax dollars are going towards in terms
of who it's arming and how this is all
happening
what kind of weaselly mealy-mouthed
[ __ ] is that Liz and you know that's
weaselly in mealy-mouthed you know cuz
elizabeth warren is very smart you're
very smart so we know that this isn't
that's not how you respond to what
fundamentally is it's allegations of
genocide happening us-backed genocide so
Saudi Arabia is blockading Yemen they're
not allowing in food and necessary
medicine there's now a cholera outbreak
where millions of people have cholera
and they're not allowing in treatment
for it they've bombed hospitals they've
bombed schools they've bombed open-air
markets the civilian death count is what
over 10,000 at this point there abouts
they just bombed a school bus with
children on it and your responses I sent
a mean letter and told them the American
people have a right to know what's going
on here no you're supposed to take an
anti-war stand a principled anti-war
stand I am against backing Saudi Arabia
and doing this and furthermore we need
to apply international pressure to get
them to immediately stop doing this but
obviously step number one is immediately
cut off all arms to Saudi Arabia since
they are a terrorist regime but no and
see this is what I mean when I say there
are upsides and downsides of Elizabeth
Warren the upside is she's talking about
money in politics there she's making
really good points about corruption the
upside is she's talking she's shining
the spotlight on what's happening in
Yemen the downside is it's woefully
inadequate and pathetically short of
where she should go and again um what
I'm telling you guys is her instincts
are correct she's demonstrated time and
time again that in inside of Elizabeth
Bor and there's a real lefty waiting to
get out but she's been in Washington DC
too long now and they've beaten those
instincts out of her and every time she
has a meeting with some high paid
consultant they 100 percent of the time
give her the wrong advice and then she
ends up going out there and frankly
looking a little ridiculous because the
real lefties we're gonna look at this
and go how shameful is that you're gonna
shine a spotlight on Yemen but not call
for ending it ending the slaughter of
innocent children stopping arming Saudi
Arabia
that's not then you're not taking a
moral stand you're doing [ __ ] virtue
signaling and posturing to try to appear
like you're on the left but you're not
really advocating that left wing
position and is it really that hard to
say hey genocide should be we shouldn't
actively facilitate a genocide I mean
that would seem to be like thing one on
a list of what moral people would do but
no she brings up Yemen and then she she
slams on the brakes before the logical
conclusion come on Liz come on you think
I wouldn't prefer Elizabeth Warren being
president to Donald frickin Trump of
course I would but she needs to start
advocating the proper position on these
issues and she needs to stop listening
to those DC lobbyists because or excuse
me the consultants because they're gonna
[ __ ] her up man they really are they're
gonna ruin whatever chance she has so
you know take it for what it's worth I
hope that somehow she sees this because
she should recognize that this is not I
don't put Elizabeth Warren in the same
category as Hillary Clinton Hillary
Clinton I think was so immensely corrupt
and she's just the epitome of a
corporatist neoliberal war monger that
she was too far gone and that I don't
think there is
you could prod Hillary from the left and
she would be more receptive than then
probably Donald Trump if you try to prod
him from the left but she was still
there was like it was hopeless because
her whole career was every time there
was a very important and vital decision
she was reliably on the wrong side
whether it be the Iraq war or the
Patriot Act or whatever it may be you
name it the bankruptcy bill is another
great example of it so even gay marriage
she didn't support until 2013 so there
was no hope for Hillary Clinton
Elizabeth Warren there's hope for but
she keeps [ __ ] doing the doggy paddle
in the wrong direction for lack of a
better way
to describe that and I really hope that
she stops
so laura ingraham stepped up her
propaganda this week let's watch that
now in the midst of this massive
economic boom under President Trump it's
stunning how Democrats simply refuse to
learn if Trump's for it they're against
it even on issues they used to be for
like look at how they've refused for
instance to work with Trump on
legalizing the dreamers or even maybe on
prison reform they won't work with them
well we now see that anti Trump delirium
is pushing Democrats further out of the
American mainstream right to socialism a
new Gallup poll confirms that more
Democrats prefer socialism to capitalism
57% view socialism favorably while just
47% have a favorable view of capitalism
just two years ago those numbers were
flipped 50 cent 6% then favored
capitalism of course it could be that
socialism's attractive new poster gal is
changing minds do you think that the
future of the Democratic Party is
socialism well first of all there's a
huge difference between socialism and
democratic socialism democratic
socialism and really what what that
boils down to me is the basic belief
that I believe that in a moral and and
wealthy America in a moral and modern
America no person should be too poor to
live in this case Trump believes that -
that's why he's growing the economy so
fast
well or maybe it's the indoctrination
against capitalism on college campuses
for instance at Middlebury College
juniors can take a class called beyond
intersectionality developing anti-racist
and anti-capitalist feminism's a
University of Michigan textbook used for
activism class teaches that capitalism
should be overthrown and according to
data from open syllabus project Karl
Marx is the most assigned economist in
u.s. college classes today
great what college students this would
benefit from is a little less rage and a
little more reality like this
devastating exchange
now this goes back to the 70s one of my
favorites between Nobel prize-winning
economist Milton Friedman and old lefty
Phil Donahue it should be required
viewing when you when you see the greed
and the concentration of power with it
daren't you ever did you ever have a
moment of doubt about capitalism and
whether Greed's a good idea to run on
well first of all tell me is there some
society you know that doesn't run on
greed you think Russia doesn't run on
greed you think China doesn't run on
greed
what is greed of course none of us are
greedy it's only the other fellow who's
crazy
this the world runs on individuals
pursuing their separate enters the great
achievements of civilization have not
come from government bureaus Einstein
didn't construct his theory under order
from a from a bureaucrat Henry Ford
didn't revolutionize the automobile
industry that way in the only cases in
which the masses have escaped from the
kind of grinding poverty you're talking
about the only cases in recorded history
or weather where they have had
capitalism and largely free trade if you
want to know where the masses are worse
than worse off worst off it's exactly in
the kinds of societies that depart from
that now let's face it without a solid
grounding in real fact-based economics
and history our young people are sitting
ducks for any huckster promising
freebies free health care free college
free housing and the list goes on and on
free scooters here's an indisputable
historical fact that alludes most
college professors these days there has
never been a successful socialist
government not ever a hundred million
people were killed in socialist regimes
in 20th century the USSR China Cuba
Vietnam North Korea Nicaragua ISM Bob
way etc etc but we don't have to reach
into the annals of history to tell us
this just look at Venezuela today a
country rich in oil where the middle
class once prospered no more and there
we have it time how long was it little
over four
and we finally got to Venezuela it
really is it's it's hilarious at this
point like we've mocked it it's become
like a meme online the rule you're not
listening to us like we'll say something
and their response is just I didn't hear
anything you said Venezuela
okay so earlier we did a segment about
Tucker Carlson and how I think his
framing it was actually a master class
it was a clinic in how to do propaganda
because the points where he needed to
kind of round off those rough edges he
did it successfully like he found a way
to not just come out and save the things
that were utterly ridiculous but he
would just like hint at it and then it
was very sly and clever framing where
you could actually convince people who
aren't already agreeing with you Laura
Ingraham is not as artful I don't think
she's as smart as Tucker Carlson so she
just comes out and says this stuff that
you're supposed to hint at and she makes
it so easy to rebut her because the
entire thing is just a [ __ ] one giant
straw man where she's talking to herself
and sniffing her own farts and not
listening to the counter points that are
being made okay so let's go from the top
here she talks about the Democrats still
don't get it there's a massive economic
boom in Trump's economy right off the
bat there that's such a bad point that
even there are even right-wingers who
will look at what you just said there
and go you're an idiot you have no idea
who you're talking about in fact I'm
gonna get to a segment later about this
exactly about how there are libertarian
economists who are like look out [ __ ]
this economy's fake now Trump and
Republicans love to all great amazing
economy it's ours it's mine I get credit
for everything that's happening right
now in the economy you're gonna wish you
didn't say that when this thing [ __ ]
tanks and it's gonna tank because this
is the most obvious bubble in human
history but Laura Ingraham is too stupid
to realize it
so yeah this amazing economy it's so
wonderful so perfect sure wages are down
and your average person is hurting and
half of workers in America make
thirty thousand dollars a year or less
and the minimum wage isn't even a living
wage but uh there's a massive economic
boom and the Democrats don't even learn
no you don't learn you've learned
nothing we're in a [ __ ] bubble what
happened in the 19-teens and 1920s when
they did tax cuts for the rich and
massive deregulation the Great
Depression what happened after Ronald
Reagan did tax cuts for the rich and
deregulation a giant recession what
happened when Bill Clinton and George W
Bush did tax cuts for the rich and
deregulation and actually to be fair to
Clinton he didn't do the tax cuts for
the rich he just did the deregulation
Bush did the tax cuts for the rich and
further deregulation what happened it is
always a boom-bust cycle you ignorant
buffoon and the thing that's so
frustrating is she's so smug in her
wrongness like ha the Democrats don't
get it this economy's awesome it's
awesome
like she didn't even occur to her that
maybe that's not true at all didn't
occur to her for a second okay that's
the first point second point is she just
lies what these Democrats are so crazy
they don't even want to do a deal for
the dreamers the Republicans have a
majority you say Trump wants to do a
deal for the dreamers the Republicans
have a majority they could do it and
they don't even need the Democrats they
can do it themselves what they want to
do it what do you mean it's they don't
want to do it Trump says every now and
then oh yeah sure I'll make a deal but
then he never does it why cuz he's lying
cuz he's on both sides of every single
issue so we can get away with everything
oh here I'll give you both sides of
everything so that you could just read
into it what you want to read into it
and think that I believe whatever you
want me to believe it's it's an old
trick and he's brilliant at it he was
doing it during the campaign and I was
only one pointing out
okay so dreamers [ __ ] you talking about
of course the Democrats will make it
Iran the dreamers will do it like that
but they don't actually want to do with
the Republicans oh um then he said then
she said well they're their argument
Ocasio cortes says no person should be
too poor to live so she she portrays
that like it's a stupid thing to say
like oh look at these pie-in-the-sky Pro
socialism for lefties by the way yet
again for the
9,000 time we're really not talking
about social ownership of the means of
production socialism socialism we're
talking about social democracy within a
capitalist framework you do a welfare
state you have the bare minimums the
bare necessities meant like Scandinavia
like the Nordic region okay so she
portrays it as like oh no person should
be poor to live isn't that so stupid
then when she cuts back from that clip
she goes Oh Trump agrees with that
so then why were you just mocking it as
if it's stupid if you agree with it why
were you mocking it they can't see that
this is why she's not nearly as good as
Tucker Carlson at this and this is why
he's got probably a significantly better
rating is that he's at least somewhat
artful in his [ __ ] Laura Ingraham
has just fallen all over herself
oh he's stupid lefties they believe in
things like no person should be too poor
to live and Trump believes that too but
I agree with Trump when he believes that
but when the left believes it I attack
them for it see here's the thing that
you're not getting Laura when you play
that clip of Ocasio Cortes people are
gonna agree with it and they're not
ranked partisan hacks like you are a lot
of people aren't so what they'll do is
they'll say well that seemed perfectly
reasonable to me so I don't why are you
attacking her when she says that but you
defend Trump when you say he believes it
okay then she goes on to say oh these
the left is so out of control look at
these Klout classes that they're
teaching on college campuses and ones
like anti-racist class anti-capitalist
class whatever the [ __ ] it was now I
thought that you guys were the against
censorship people on college campuses
that's why you tell me now I happen to
agree with you guys on that issue to the
extent you actually believe it I'm an
actual free speech warrior and my record
speaks for itself I'm the most
consistent [ __ ] free speech warrior
probably that there is in modern
politics I'm I actually will stand up
for left wingers and right wingers if
their free speech is being surprised so
for you two guys to claim over free
speech warriors but then you you're
showing these classes as if I can't
believe these classes exist in anti
capitalist class and anti-racist class
yeah that should exist in the same way
that there should be classes that teach
the history of [ __ ] fascism that
should exist too why is that I thought
the free marketplace of ideas on the
college campus unless
their left-wing ideas in which case I'm
gonna point it out and say I can't
believe these classes exist and then she
goes on to no context whatsoever said
Marx is the most cited economist in
class she acts like the implication is
oh all these colleges are teaching Marx
and there's their Pro Marx you do know
that Marx can be taught in class and
they people are not necessarily Pro Marx
right like you do know that it's
important to know what he said even if
you massively disagree with him right I
hope you know that are you really that
stupid do you don't know that and by the
way I'm sure that that's the case it's
not like Marx is being taught and it's
all nothing but Pro Marx coverage now
and by the way as I've pointed out
repeatedly I don't agree with Marx's
solutions but you cannot deny that his
critiques of capitalism are stunningly
brilliant they are they just are even
people who are massively anti marks can
admit that just because you don't agree
with his solutions doesn't mean that his
critique of capitalism isn't merited and
isn't worth knowing it certainly is but
she again she makes it seem like we're
the free-speech people but marks being
cited on college campuses I don't like
that get rid of the mark stuff well then
you're not the free-speech people okay
then she plays that Milton Friedman clip
now it's a curious clip to pick because
Milton Friedman it you know at times he
has said brilliant stuff I don't agree
with him overall but at times he said
brilliant stuff that was not one of the
examples because one of the things he
says oh great achievement didn't come
from government didn't we go to the moon
because of the government and also this
idea it'll it always comes from probably
the private market that's where all the
innovation comes from that's so
stunningly naive and ignorant because
the reality is yes even when it comes to
the Internet the initial funding that
led to the development and creation of
the Internet internet yes that came from
the government Al Gore got a bunch of
[ __ ] because he said oh I you know he
said something along the lines of like I
I did some of the initial funding that
led to the creation of the Internet and
people were mocking because it's like he
was taking credit for creating the
Internet
which is obviously an extreme thing to
say but the general idea of government
funding leading to the development
creation of the internet that's true it
was government funding cuz there's no
immediate Ness there's no immediately
obvious profit margin in creating
something like the Internet so private
companies gonna look at it and say you
want me to invest how much money for no
guaranteed payoff they're not gonna say
yes to that and they didn't say yes to
that they needed government investment
so it's just ignorant and wrong to say
oh there's nothing good ever comes from
the government then Laura Ingraham again
totally drops all the nuance and says
things that are flat-out stupid she says
she mocks the idea of free health care
and free college and she equates it to
free scooters how do you not see how
stupid that is who compares free health
care and college necessities education
necessity health care necessity who
compares that to free scooters you do
cuz you're a jackass and then of course
the final cherry on top
no socialist government anywhere has
worked she cites a bunch by the way
notice she slipped in North Korea but
you're not even trying
you're not even trying with your
propaganda everything that I don't like
that's bad is socialism everything that
I don't like that's bad Stalin socialism
Hitler socialism North Korea socialism I
stubbed my toe in the morning socialism
you have to at least be somewhat nuanced
in your criticism instead of just
flinging your feces against the wall and
hoping it sticks so that's obviously
wrong and when you say there's never
been a successful socialist government
you totally omit an entire category of
social democracy which has been my point
all along it's been the point of many
people in this insurgent left-wing
movement all along that they keep
telling you that we can't create a
better future and that's not correct and
we have it's like we have all the
empirical evidence on our side if you
just point to Scandinavia in the Nordic
countries all of the evidence but the
only way they could counter argue is to
just ignore our
entire point and pretend were making a
point that we're not making they really
their whole argument is to pretend like
we're saying we want Venezuela that's
their whole argument but we're not
saying that none of us are saying that
most of us are saying we want
Scandinavia but they don't even
acknowledge that I don't know socialism
people died it was bad I thought
Arianism something something stupid kids
you want free health care in college
that's not workable even though it works
in every other developed country
perfectly so it's just as clever as
Tucker was in his propaganda Laura
Ingraham was the exact opposite and was
embarrassingly pathetic and sad with it
and that's probably why her ratings are
worse than Tucker Carlson because she
doesn't know how to massage the point
she only she only she's a bull in a
china shop and the only people who are
gonna watch that are people who are
already massively inclined to agree with
her so that's not an audience that's
gonna grow with Tucker on the other hand
he was just clever enough and smooth
enough with his propaganda where he
could win over some new people because
they'll say oh it seems like he might be
making sense Laura they're not gonna do
that if they're thinking even even a
little bit as they watch Laura Ingraham
segment
Tucker Carlson did a segment going after
the left here I want to watch it with
everyone and then grade his commentary
good evening and welcome to Tucker
Carlson tonight midterm elections are
just months away and no matter what you
hear the truth is Democrats do have a
strong chance of taking over the House
of Representatives of history is any
guide what does that mean well the short
term it means that Nancy Pelosi will get
unfettered subpoena power Maxine Waters
is likely to be chairman of the
Financial Services Committee it will be
a big deal but more broadly it means an
ascendant Democratic Party and not the
party you grew up with but a new and far
more radical and far more intolerant
version of that party how radical well
last night we showed you the violence
tonight we have exclusive new material
the product of our reporting just two
weeks ago progressive activists held the
convention in New Orleans called
Netroots nation happens every year
virtually every major Democrat running
for president went by the fast evolving
standards of the Left Netroots nation is
a mainstream gathering it's not a fringe
event well this show sent an
investigative team to Netroots nation to
find out what the Democratic Party is
becoming the very first thing we noticed
is that socialism long discredited by
nearly a century of murder and suffering
is really and moving toward the center
of democratic politics what I see is not
a time for moderation it's a time for
progressives to double down on what we
believe in the establishment is
terrified of that word socialism but if
we learned one thing from the Obama
years if the Republicans are going to
call us socialists no matter what we do
so we might as well give them the real
thing
[Applause]
might as well give them real socialism
the crowd cheers just 10 years ago
Democrats nodded to the idea of border
security they said they were for it now
the very idea of immigration enforcement
of any kind of borders themselves is
considered repugnant on the left I
happen to believe that an agency that
has repeatedly systematically and
violent and violently committed human
rights abuses cannot be reformed just
imagine no wall no wall in southern
Arizona disagree with that think open
borders are a bad idea you're not simply
wrong in the eyes of the new left you're
immoral the Republicans will continue to
practice the politics of division they
will keep right on attacking anyone who
dares to stand up to the rich and the
powerful do you need to wait for robert
muller to tell you trump is wildly
corrupt we must defeat a republican
party which has sold its soul to a
republican a republican president
without one president has no soul
republicans are in the pocket of the
rich says the hedge fund private equity
party the president of course denounced
as a racist while actual race baiters
like Maxine Waters who once encouraged
race riot were lauded as heroes
President Trump and do your race bathing
and make your racial statements whether
it's LeBron James or Maxine Waters or
anybody else that a plan anymore
President Trump well ironically for a
gathering they said was designed to
empower the marginalized voters of color
as they say attendees at this event
tended to skew much older paler and more
affluent well a group of aggressive
activists noticed this and a group of
them stormed the stage during Saturday's
keynote speeches they demanded more
black representation and they promised
to drink the crowds quote white tears
that white fragility is sowing
those white tears are sewing but guess
what I'm ready to drink them because we
are going to be on the board you're
going to let us on the board and you're
going to fight for us to be on the board
of networks ready to drink white tier so
on an effort to atone for their skin
color organizers did what they could to
attack white America among the books
distributing the event was one called
brown is the new white how demographic
revolution has created a new American
majority one poster we found said that
one of the quote challenges for American
democracy is that white voters are able
to vote and elect officials in any other
venue that would of course be described
as racism but it was normal ad net roots
and then there were the bizarre portions
of the program and there were a lot of
those one well-attended panel dealt with
a matter of quote menstrual equity this
is the latest frontier in the civil
rights movement in case you've been on
vacation one elected Democrat from
Virginia we spoke to said mail access to
tampons is a vital and important
emerging issue we're not sure how many
men who are menstruating based on that
transgender surgeries or other ways that
they're transforming we're not sure how
many men are menstruating happily the
Democratic Party is trying to find out
even as you sleep it went on like this
this is what the Democratic Party is
running on in 2018 the end of free
enterprise vicious attacks on a huge
portion of the American population
solely because of their skin color
tampons in men's bathrooms this is a
movement that seeks to end borders and
create a world where there are only two
kinds of people the 320 million American
citizens who live here you and me and
the 7 billion US citizens who haven't
gotten around to moving here yet but if
every right to move here when they feel
like it that would be the rest of the
world I want to break this down because
it really was a masterclass in straw
Manning in an effective way that's going
to 100% feed the audience exactly what
they're looking for so let's break this
down from the top so he starts with Oh
what's gonna happen in the midterm
elections in 2018 well the left can win
Democrats can win
and their whole thing is now socialism
so socialism is reemerging now notice he
does in a masterful conflation there
because he goes from oh the democrats
are running on socialism which by the
way LOL along with me
unfortunately the establishment wing of
the democratic party is still the
predominant wing and their neoliberal
corporatist war mongers now the left
flank of the party certainly they're not
actual socialists they're social
democrats but okay we'll get back to
that later
because what tucker does is this he goes
oh socialism is taking over the
democratic party and it's not like we
haven't had experiments where that's
failed every time it's been implemented
and it's led to countless deaths so look
at the amazing sorry i had a bug on me
think of the look at the amazing
inflation that he just did right there
it's oh the modern-day democratic party
is equal to some of the worst communist
dictatorships throughout history and
he's a little more subtle with it
because i think he's he's smart enough
to realize that if he actually comes out
and says it that everybody will mock him
and say it's stupid so he plays more
subtle with it there are other hosts on
fox who are not as intelligent as tucker
so they don't know how to be how to take
off the rough edges and they'll just
come out and say like all the democrats
are like Josef Stalin or Mao that's who
they're like and you know that's where
everybody can mock and laugh that one
and and you're only preaching to the
furthest fringe of your choir if you
come out and say it but he's smarter and
he couches it so that he had gives
himself deniability so that once he's
called out and he's out I didn't say
that
so but that's that's the implication
there oh the Democrats are running on
socialism and look at what happen it's
been a failure throughout history in the
led to countless deaths so what he's
trying to do is is basically make the
argument that these Democrats
if they win they're gonna they'll be
authoritarian because that was the
operative factor that
was the the downfall of all of those you
know communist attempts is that they
were effectively authoritarian so when
your authoritarian you take away all
social freedoms and you try to maintain
absolute totalitarian control and that's
the problem the problem isn't that like
oh we gave people equal opportunity the
problem is that they're effectively
authoritarian systems so he does a great
an amazing conflation they're like all
the Democrats are gonna run on socialism
and oh it's always been a failure
throughout history so why would we want
to try this again
so that's the trick number one and it's
impressive then he goes on to just the
flat-out straw man of his opponents
where he says ah this this new movement
on the Left totally wants to abolish
borders now what is he referring to I'm
sure if I bring this up to him this is
exactly what he'd do he'd say oh but
look at that Democratic Socialist tweet
from New York City DSA that mentioned
that they want to abolish borders Tucker
do a poll of people on the left do a
poll of people in the Democratic Party
and outside of the Democratic Party on
the Left the percentage of people who
are actually four totally opening the
borders I submit to you is absolutely
marginal and here's how many people are
running on that which is Tucker central
claim that ah they're all they're all
running on that policy here's how many
you're running on that zero certainly
nobody I've seen now maybe I'm wrong and
maybe you guys could point me to one or
two people perhaps they exist I don't
know but it is certainly not uh you know
a main policy point of the insurgent
left you want to know how I know I
founded one of the one of the most
important insurgent left groups justice
Democrats that is not in our platform
okay so what does he played a buttresses
point he shows Alexandria Ocasio Cortes
attacking ice but you're conflating
abolishing ice with abolishing borders
Alexander he didn't say that and
Alexandria doesn't believe that she
didn't say abolish Customs and Border
Protection Customs and Border Protection
already protects the border ice was
created in 2003 so you're not you are
strong
that's what you're doing I don't know if
he's doing it and he knows he's doing it
or I don't know if he just doesn't know
and he thinks like no she she really is
for abolishing borders but then the
other point he makes which leads me to
think he's being disingenuous because
the evidence he cites for oh they're
running on no borders the evidence he
cites for that Ocasio Cortez who didn't
say that and then there was another guy
there who says oh imagine no wall to say
I'm not in favor of a wall does not mean
I want zero borders so again it's a
straw man now here's why that's
brilliant because people who are
listening to him who already agree with
him and people who might not totally
agree with him but they might watch a
show if you every now and then they
could walk away from that that portion
going oh [ __ ]
they really are running on abolishing
borders now again not true not true
Alexander Ocasio Cortez had abolished
ice not abolish customs and border
protection ice was created in 2003 their
allegations that they're doing a literal
slavery and that's going through the
court proceedings right now and the 10th
Circuit Court of Appeals says that has
merit it looks like they're doing forced
labor slavery at in a private prison
camp that ice is running seems kind of
important doesn't it but no he pretends
like the argument was abolished borders
not no wall and abolished ice totally
misleading but if you're somebody who's
on the bubble and you watch this you're
gonna go damn maybe Tucker's right these
guys are crazy then he plays a video of
them going after the rich and it's
saying oh we're against corruption and
Trump is corrupt ok well that just helps
people on the Left because that's gonna
be a portion of what you're attacking
we're even the people on the left even
people on the right will go yeah I kind
of agree with that one yeah
Wall Street did kind of [ __ ] us and they
did give out bonuses when they weren't
deserved and the rich do get away with
hiding their [ __ ] you know using tax
havens overseas and getting away with it
and paying the capital gains rate which
is lower than the income tax rate so
people though say yeah no that was
correct they're corrupt but what does
Tucker do we flip sin he goes oh no
they're the party of a hedge fund
managers dude right now Donald Trump is
trying to get rid of the consumer
Financial Protection Bureau which
protects defrauded Americans he put
somebody in charge of it who's against
it who's a puppet of the payday loan
industry okay he's trying he's
obliterated glass-steagall through
various deregulatory executive orders or
I'm sorry dodd-frank glass-steagall has
already not been implemented um he's
doing deregulation he's cutting taxes
for the rich the idea that like oh it's
the Democrats who are really the party
of Wall Street and hedge fund managers
while the Republicans are not know the
reality is Tucker Republicans are
definitely the party of Wall Street
hedge fund managers and Democrats are
too but to a slightly lesser extent now
I'm not giving the Democrats to pass on
their on how beholden they are to Wall
Street because that's not acceptable but
which side has an insurgent movement
that says we're not taking any corporate
PAC money or any big donor money oh
that's right is the left and in fact
it's the same people that Tucker
slamming because Netroots nation is
supposed to be gathering of the actual
left not just establishment people so I
mean think about that the one side that
has an insurgent movement that says no
Wall Street money no corporate PAC money
we're gonna represent the people that's
the side that he's claiming oh you guys
are the party of hedge funds again
totally misleading totally wrong but if
you're watching this and you already
agree with him or you're just lean in
his direction you might walk away from
that calling damn I guess Tucker's right
then and this is the cherry on top and
this is the brilliant part in my opinion
and this is why I think he's
significantly better than Hannity in
terms of getting an audience like
Kennedy is only gonna get the die-hard
people who don't think who are like oh I
don't care the Hannity's a hypocrite I
don't care when that these Republicans
are hypocrites I will overlook that
because I'm simply playing for a team I
think Tucker is a lot more knew Austin
how he massages these points and it's
not as obvious that he's a bullshitter
even though he is a bullshitter he gets
to the part about racial politics and he
plays the person who stormed the stage
and Massaro I'm gonna drink your white
tears now hold on
they storm the stage so that would be by
definition they are Outsiders from the
event they weren't there they storm the
stage so how you're painting this
gathering as ah the crazy fringe when it
appears like this crazy fringe that
you're maligning storm the stage to get
on that doesn't make much sense to me
Tucker yeah I agree with you that guy
was goofy talking about drinking white
tears perhaps that's why he wasn't
initially invited now he goes from that
to the worst example of the silliness uh
that that we need to genuinely deal with
if we're on the Left uh some guy who's
like oh we need menstrual equity and
male access to tampons is very important
so in other words trans people who
transition to female who are
menstruating but how would the
administrator if they transition to
female I don't know exactly what's going
on in that guy's mind it's ridiculous
but that's the point is so what happened
there I my guess is Tucker's crew
searched for the most fringe wacky kooky
example to put front and center and say
oh this is what the left is and that's
what he goes on to say this is what
they're running on in 2018 he plays the
clip of the dude talking about male
menstruation and then he goes
immediately to this is what they're
running on in 2018 with that framing
nobody's gonna disagree everybody's
gonna go oh obviously yeah they're we're
against that cuz that guy's silly me
speaking to somebody on the left I look
at that guy I go he's silly so that was
a brilliant move where you take the most
radical fringe example of somebody on
the left and then you say you you imply
this is the entire movement and this is
what they're running on in 2018 and then
you go uh see that's why you got a vote
with the Republicans and go right wing
because look at this male menstruation
crazy people over here now it's easy you
want to go to a right-wing conference
and find the people who say that you
know Obama is a Kenyan Muslim
marxists you can find that you want to
go to a right-wing conference and find
the people who've gone full conspiracy
to the point where they say lizard
people run the world you can find that
if I did a segment where I played that
and then I said quote this is what
they're running on in 2018 that would be
disingenuous now I would attack those
people but I would attack them on their
own merits and I would say hey you guys
are an issue I wouldn't say this is what
they're running on 20 teen because
that's not true as much as I despise the
Republican candidates they're not
running on lizard people run the world
so here's here's the the heart of that
trick the crux of that trick he didn't
grapple with any of the real points
being made by this insurgent left-wing
movement what are the real points that
were making well the most important one
is like I said taking no corporate PAC
money no Wall Street money no
billionaire money and running candidates
on small dollar donations that's the
most important thing remember he said oh
these people is the party of hedge funds
we have a movement to run candidates
taking know big donor money you guys
don't on the right we do okay so you're
not grappling with that that we're an
anti-corruption there's a giant
anti-corruption movement now surging on
the left you're not grappling with that
you're not grappling with any of our top
policy platforms that were actually
pushing for Medicare for all free
college living wage and the wars new New
Deal legalized marijuana and the drug
war now to the extent he does address it
what does he do socialism just take it
put it in a basket push it off to the
side that's it that's socialism so
there's no acknowledgment that actually
no we're not talking about the social
ownership of the means of production
that's actual socialism we're talking
about social democracy within a
capitalist framework having bare
minimums met that's what every other
developed country has that's what the
Nordic model does so brilliantly so he
doesn't even grapple with what we're
really saying what the movement is
really about and in his segment going
after the left for the midterms he
doesn't even mention Medicare for all
free college living wage and the wars
new New Deal legalized marijuana
tax Wall Street he brings up none of our
most important issues these are the
issues by the way that it is universal
among the candidates on the left that
Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey spoke to Lester
Holt of NBC about their current policy
in regards to free speech I want to
watch this here and I want you to notice
something as you watch this look at how
the standards gradually change and the
goalposts gradually move and then look
at at the end what the implication from
Lester Holt is to Jack because this is
very very very important and I feel like
it's precisely what I've been warning
about the entire time and it's a
genuinely dangerous path that we're
going down here but let's take a look
and then we'll discuss well Alex Jones
on Twitter posted this week what
essentially is a video calling for
people to get their battle rifles ready
against the media saying it's time to
act it's got to be done now people need
to have their battle rifles everything
ready their bedsides
and you got to be ready send a chill up
my spine how about yours
it did I mean there's a number of
actions that we believe help a call to
incitement to violence and those are the
things that we need to make sure that we
are taking action on you've taken action
against him in this instance what can
you tell us what it is
I believe we put him in a timeout
removing his ability to tweet for a time
period that period just seven days and
presumably after that Jones will be back
a timeout seems minor compared to the
implications of someone suggesting a
call to arms against a particular group
in this case the media how do you
respond to that well I feel any
suspension whether it be a permanent one
or a temporary one make someone think
about their actions and their behaviors
and just behavior based on a time that I
don't know I'm speaking more broadly as
to why we utilize this particular tool
we we have found that it does have the
potential to change impact and change
behavior it's Twitter's first move to
mute Joe and since the company's major
social media appears restricted or
removed him from their platforms
exposing dorsey to broad criticisms
while winning him conditional praise
from jones are you comfortable with the
idea that to some and on the far right
the extreme that your hero i'm not i
don't agree with the the actions that
that are employed and the behaviors that
are employed so an attaboy from alex
jones isn't that something that you wish
they have no it's not something I was
expecting or need Jones has become a
symbol for the dehumanizing speech that
has invaded social media something
Dorsey has vowed to better police do you
have regrets about how you acted in
terms of some of the Sandy Hook
allegations that it was a hoax
I do feel terrible at what the parents
had to go through and you know I think
we we have felt behind and we have felt
that we have moved too slow and a lot of
our actions Dorsey says the aim is
consistency and how they enforce the
rules do you make exceptions for
high-profile individuals in terms of
your your rules of service
no we hold every account to the same
standard to the same rules President of
the United States yesterday called a
woman Omarosa that dog would that
violate your Terms of Service so we do
have a clause within our Terms of
Service around public interest and
around news news worthiness we believe
it's important for the world to hear
directly from global leaders how they
think and how they treat the people
around them you don't make it a thing to
make exception you don't make a
distinction however you know what we're
policy talking about taxes or tariffs
versus calling a person that dog we make
an understanding of who is actually
saying that and whether they are a
global leader or whether they are a
public figure and whether this is
something that should be reported on and
should be talked about in addition to
improving the health of conversations on
Twitter the companies also in a war
against bots the fake users that were
employed to artificially steer opinions
during the 2016 election we started with
you know a real focus on one core
fundamental human right
of freedom of expression but over time
we have realized that that right has
been weaponized Jack Dorsey tells me
Twitter now challenges 10 million
accounts a week to determine if they are
real people or simply BOTS so that
segment is just its importance is
gargantuan so let me explain exactly why
that is you see the logical progression
so they start out with an issue that I
think everybody can acknowledge is a
borderline issue is like there is a
question there so Alex Jones saying Oh
get your battle rifles ready now I saw
the full context of that they did not
show you the full context of that there
in my estimation based on how we framed
it he gave himself enough wiggle room
and used enough weasel words to get out
of it by the way he did the same thing
with the robert muller thing he does
like he was playing the you know the
wild wild west music like there's a
shootout at the OK Corral and he's and
he keeps saying like oh yeah me and
Muller are gonna stand there and I'm
gonna I'm gonna and he does like the
mimicking [ __ ] draw on a gun and
shooting but he kept keep saying in the
segment politically so politically it's
gonna be me and me and Robert Muller and
it's just I'm gonna get him and so
people who dislike Alex Jones by the way
for totally understandable reasons
they're gonna look at that segment and
what they do is they just disregard the
weasel words and disregard the caveats
that he uses to get out of it but the
caveats are important they're there you
can't just ignore it because you don't
like Alex Jones now by the same token in
the full context of that clip where he's
talking about the Oh get your battle
rifles ready he he basically says
they're gonna come for us
so get your battle rifles ready now is
it true that there are people coming for
him in his supporters no nobody's coming
for you that's obvious to anybody with a
functioning brain but he left himself
enough wiggle room to say I didn't I
didn't say what you're saying I said and
I've noticed this time and time and time
again every time somebody sends me a
video oh here's Alex Jones doing a
direct threat of violence or something I
watch the video and there's always some
weasel
and wriggle room that allows him to get
out of it so I know some people want to
say hey disregard the weasel words and
the wiggle room but once you do that
then there are no standards and they can
just block anybody D sensor and D
platform anybody for any reason
whatsoever because if if the wiggle room
doesn't matter and the caveats don't
matter then it's up to the benevolent
interpretations of your loyal tech
overlords to do it properly and you
should not trust them is the point I
keep trying to get across to you they're
always gonna come after the left and
independent outlets and they're always
gonna come after powerless people okay
so that's the first point but listen I'm
willing to admit up front they start
with an issue that's a borderline issue
where there is a discussion to be had
with Alex Jones oh my god get your
battle rifles ready so they start with
that Lester Holt does oh isn't you have
a problem on your platform look what are
you gonna do about it
so immediately notice the framework of
of the questions the framework isn't hey
here's thousands of accounts that were
wrongly censored or deep platformed
because of your shitty policies the
framework is hey here's one example of
maybe you should have done more to stop
it but you didn't so it said the
framework is duh the obvious answer is
you have to censor and e-platform more
people so it oftentimes in these kinds
of discussions everything is in the
question not the answer and the question
is hey why don't you do more to stop
this not hey look at all these examples
where you've done too much and maybe you
shouldn't be banning all these people
because if you take everything in
totality I submit to you there are way
more [ __ ] bands than there are ones
that made sense
okay so then they go to notice how they
move the goalposts this is so sly and
this is exactly what we've been warning
about so it starts with hey maybe here's
something where there's a genuine threat
of violence so maybe this is
to pull this down that's where they
start where did they end up Donald Trump
called Omarosa a dog should this be
allowed on your platform yes yes yes
not even close yes now does that mean
that Donald Trump is a good person no
does that mean that I support Donald
Trump no he's a [ __ ] terrible person
his policies are horrendous and he's
loathsome but should you be allowed to
call somebody a dog on Twitter yes I was
in a Twitter argument two days ago and I
called somebody a [ __ ] if Lester
Holt shows on the screen my tweet
totally out of context and it says I
said yes [ __ ] to somebody he could
easily go to Jack check should such
dehumanizing and harassing language be
allowed on your platform yes of course
it should people talk [ __ ] that's a
thing that happens now it's the
President of the United States you could
say oh that's below the dignity of the
office fine but that doesn't mean he
should be banned what I find amazing is
it's not like there aren't examples that
are borderline with Trump there are you
want to talk about threats of violence
he literally threatened to bomb North
Korea and Iran on Twitter that is a
violation of Terms of Service but on
those issues and I mean closer like oh
yeah he's allowed to do that one but you
called somebody a dog sir and she was a
woman and black come on man yes you
should be able to call somebody a dog
you should be able to call it you should
be able to talk [ __ ] and call people
names see this is I warned you about the
slippery slope it all you can see it in
that segment oh hey maybe this was a
threat to violence not really but maybe
hey you should do more oh and also
people call other people bad names are
you [ __ ] kidding me so now you want
to take the platform that was originally
you know created for free speech reasons
and ban people because they call people
mean words oh come on man the entire
establishment media has been begging
Twitter to do more censoring and deep
platforming CNN has a guy who that's his
whole beat Oliver Darcy his whole
[ __ ] for I go read this guy's Twitter
feed it is
stop like prodding social media Facebook
Twitter YouTube hey you should ban more
people and and crackdown more oh thank
you for your service Oliver how [ __ ]
brave of you to find wrong feint and say
please ban this what a [ __ ] joke this
is cuz you called somebody a dog you
want it are you [ __ ] kidding me and
then finally and I told you the
goalposts keep moving and then they move
it even beyond that so it goes from hey
maybe Alex Jones incited violence you
should get rid of him too hey Donald
Trump called somebody a dog maybe you
should get rid of people that call other
people bad names sheer lunacy and then
it becomes oh you're pert I see you're
purging the bots and the people who
meddled in the election in 2016
oh here we go here we go so I know
people who were accused of being BOTS
that influenced the election they're not
BOTS they're people who had a twitter
account who read the DNC email leaks and
said oh [ __ ] the primary was rigged look
at all this evidence now I'm going to
tweet about that well according to the
establishment media if you meddled in
the 2016 election you're a bot so people
who have who don't have the cookie
cutter pre-approved establishment
opinions are going to be considered bots
and they're gonna be deleted
again I'm not speaking out of my ass
here I know people who have had their
accounts pulled down and they've been
accused of being BOTS in the 2016
election so think about that man this is
this is how far we've slipped oh hey
maybe incitement pulled him down oh but
also pulled down people who say mean
words about other people too oh why
don't you just take down all the bots
who are meddling in the election well by
definition they're gonna say that
anything that is reporting on the
Russian propaganda that are factual
leaks from the DNC that proved an
election was being Reagan that there was
corruption at the highest levels but hey
if they're talking about that we could
just say they're by definition Russian
propaganda and their BOTS so take
all of those accounts in one [ __ ]
segment every point I made was proven
correct it starts with the cases where
there's a genuine question hey maybe you
should or shouldn't take him down and
maybe incitement maybe defamation in
some cases goalpost moves - you call
people mean words we don't like that
we're gonna pull you down and then the
goalpost moves to just take down all the
bots that are influencing the election
they're never gonna do that objectively
they're gonna go after anybody who
doesn't have the pre approved
establishment opinions I warned you I
warned you and now you have the
establishment media begging for more
censorship indie platforming by the way
why why is the establishment media so
strongly on one side of this issue why
it's almost like they want to maintain
power control and they want to stay on
the top of that media hierarchy and have
a captive audience
now I'm not arguing that Alex Jones is
competition to mainstream media he's not
he's full of [ __ ] and he does fake news
way more than the mainstream media does
even though the mainstream media does a
lot of fake news but it sure is easy to
control the flow of information and
control the outlets they can see if you
try to censor indie platform and shut
down all the independent outlets we've
already seen this happening on YouTube
the algorithm totally buries my stuff
Jimmy Dore stuff David Pakman stuff
humanist report it totally buries it why
because this is what they want this is
what they're begging for hey tech
overlords we know that when we ask you
to crack down you're never gonna come
after us even though there's more of an
argument that they violated Terms of
Service and call they all cheered the
bombing in Syria
oh yes bomb a country that didn't attack
us yes yes is that a violet is that an
incitement to violence when you beg the
government to do more bombings of
countries that didn't attack us is it an
incitement to violence when you get us
into the [ __ ] war in Iraq based on
false pretences should you be taken down
as a result of that no cuz they're
grandfathered in establishment media no
consequences everybody else it's not
even legitimate consequences it's just
take them down if they're close enough
to stuff we don't like this is this is
1984 and it's it's unfolding right in
front of our eyes
this is what's happening we're now
begging totally unaccountable Silicon
Valley tech billionaire oligarchs to
censor and the platform and determine
what you should and shouldn't see if you
really think they're gonna use that
power in a way that's fair and objective
and intelligent you're a rube
you're a dunce you've been fooled
completely hundred percent not even
close
you really are you can't wait to give
these unaccountable people who are mega
wealthy and have their own biases more
power to control what you're able to see
you don't see a problem with that it's
almost too stupid to comment on I mean
obviously obviously obviously these
outlets should be regulated as public
utilities and they should have to have a
giant bias towards free speech if
there's an actual case of defamation or
libel or slander or whatever the [ __ ]
and it goes through a a proceeding and
there's a direct threat of violence or
daxing or whatever it yes you could go
after those outlets but you have to have
to be process can't just rely on [ __ ]
Jack Dorsey or Mark Zuckerberg feelings
what a joke and they're being prodded in
every which direction they're not I
can't warn you enough about this it's
beyond clear to me and you see it all in
one segment you went all the way down
that slippery slope in one segment hey
maybe incitement hey maybe bad words hey
the bots are bad banned all the people
with the wrong think here we go
hello everybody.welcome what's up
welcome to the Kyle and Koren Show
podcast see I got a new overhead light
in this room oh do you yeah I usually
have that little gangster light in the
background that is my light but we had
this handyman come to our crib we got a
new roof
first off wait y-you got a new roof yeah
we had to get a new roof because that
[ __ ] was leaking like a [ __ ]
oh [ __ ] how bad was it was a leaking
everywhere
it wasn't bad but I think I think this
isn't like the house we bought was built
in like 93 so it's not bad at all no
it's not bad but I don't think they've
had a new roof since then oh okay
and we had like a bad rainstorm one time
and in our bedroom there was like a spot
on the [ __ ] and I think it was just time
for a new roof anyway it was just one
spot that was leaking yeah that we saw
other [ __ ] could have been on some like
[ __ ] up [ __ ] and we just didn't know
and it's about to like explode in my
place there's an area where I still
don't know what causes it but like it's
almost like condensation comes out of
the wall because there's a skylight in
one part oh yeah and then so it's like
like 90 degrees 95 degrees outside in
the summer and then it's cool it's like
65 66 degrees inside and then for
whatever reason I don't know if whoever
lived there before me was a smoker and
then it comes like so when the wall like
the water comes out of the wall a little
bit it's like dirty and I was like
looking at it like oh that might be like
[ __ ] mold and I'm gonna die in eight
seconds yeah there's plenty of [ __ ] that
like when they paint like we painted the
railings in our house mm-hmm I don't
have a [ __ ] mask on for like the
whole month we're doing it like there's
definitely like when you hit when you
tap a wall in an old building and like
that little dust particle [ __ ] comes off
like there's like asbestos [ __ ] in there
like whatever it is it's not good it's
oakley's [ __ ] because it has all the
time and so there are like streaks of
like dirty water in a certain area and I
can't keep up with it because like every
day it'll it'll
we little bit oh no bugs me out is that
so we got a roof done and like when you
get your roof done it's like a whole
project like it's like it's dumb
expensive yeah it's insane so it's a
whole [ __ ] thing
it took them one day to do that whole
[ __ ] and it's like that's bad money
but it's like they're just normal people
also like they just like pretty much
have the authority and like so like just
rip off your whole roof where if I
wasn't like scared of heights and just
figured out how to rip up a roof like
they had to do research on this [ __ ]
like they probably didn't go to college
now you're thinking like our age you're
like oh how can I save some money by
trying to figure this out myself but
then if you start doing it you'll
immediately be like [ __ ] this I want
somebody else to do it it's just so
expensive for them to do in a day like
at least take a [ __ ] week or two to
do that [ __ ] make me be like all right
it was worth $6,000 or some [ __ ] like
don't do that is that how much it like
it was like five thousand six thousand
dollars some [ __ ] I mean and it looks
the same like it's funny cuz like why is
that something that needs to be updated
like wouldn't you think like when you
buy a place
whatever the roof is like it's just
gonna be good in the same way that like
it's not like you need a new floor after
a certain amount of time but you can
keep your floor forever so it's not like
but with the roof it's different it's
like oh yeah well the way they make it
it's like they make it so that it'll
[ __ ] up eventually no and then you're
like batteries like we've talked about
this [ __ ] just make a [ __ ] like
undying you're building a [ __ ] house
why don't you think like why don't the
the [ __ ] sidewalls on a house like
have to be replaced yeah like they get
just as much rain on that [ __ ] like when
a rainstorm comes through then the
[ __ ] roof does yeah it should be the
most powerful [ __ ] thinking about all
that stuff is like it's like a full-time
thing to like think about okay
everything needs to be updated
what did like it's just a pain in the
ass to think about it cuz if you're
somebody like me you never that doesn't
cross your mind you don't want to think
about that [ __ ] well and it's [ __ ] you
don't think about when you're growing up
like Oh in a house with your parents
like but until you own a house there's
so much [ __ ] that is just like you don't
[ __ ] think about like our windows
there was a little leak in our window
and we had to like put these plastic
shits over our window because like the
ice will get in and you like freeze your
window and that's real bad and like all
the stupid [ __ ] [ __ ] that like when you
go to look at a house you can't you
can't see half of that stuff you know
yeah and you definitely don't think
about it you don't know you're naive to
it all but listen [ __ ] who's
selling you this [ __ ] isn't gonna be
like oh yeah you're gonna have to get
all that [ __ ] face but like that's the
[ __ ] I don't even want to know about it
so it's kind of annoys me it's like I
don't want like there's not enough room
in my head for all that [ __ ] I don't
want to know it like I don't want I've
never been like a handy dude I don't but
I don't want to be I don't like it it
would be good for reasons like you
stated like okay I'll save some money by
doing this thing myself but I'm lazy as
[ __ ] and I already feel like there's not
enough room in my brain to remember all
the [ __ ] that I got to remember that
like you're gonna add on top of it and
you're sacrificing something else so
like my [ __ ] wife her her boss her
boss's husband is like one of those
dudes and she always says she's like oh
well this lady's what a husband can do
this and that and fixes this I was like
yeah but he probably can't make her
[ __ ] laugh yeah there's it's there's
ups and downs man there's ups and downs
like yeah everybody's everybody's got
pluses everybody's got minuses
everybody's like a package deal like
okay this person is a good provider but
they have no personality or this person
has a bangin personality but they're not
gonna provide for like there's something
there's there's a trade-off at some
point you know I mean it's that's with
everything like Shaquille O'Neal like
you he's one of the best [ __ ] like
centers of all time but he couldn't
shoot a jump shot like everyone has the
floor you just have to fly it like find
that [ __ ] so if someone's over there
like raving about someone now go all
that person is great he probably has a
little dick or some [ __ ] or probably
something wrong with it
no perfect [ __ ] person out there yeah
that's so funny I mean there's people
always there a lot of people do
overcompensation like
there will be somebody who was fat and
then because they were self-conscious
about being fat they become a gym rat
and then they get really healthy you
know like that's something that happens
seen that happen a million times
I was super since I was so skinny at one
point that I went through a phase of
like I'm gonna I'm gonna be a gym rat
yeah but even I mean like but there's
always someone that's gonna be [ __ ]
way bigger or some [ __ ] and you're just
gonna look at them and be like I'll
never be like that [ __ ] I never
I always thought the bodybuilder look
was a little silly when it got too big
you know what I mean some of them dudes
like you [ __ ] look at them and it's
just like that doesn't look natural it's
not that it's not not just that it
doesn't look natural it looks like
ridiculous it looks like you're not
there's a certain point there's like a
tipping point like okay here's as big as
you can get and then if you go above
this it's like what are you doing bro
yeah but they don't think that way they
think like no it's like like just push
it as far as you can go and then that's
like people with [ __ ] plastic surgery
too it's like my point they just stop
realizing what they just want a perfect
look in their mind little Kim was like
sexy yeah yeah yeah yeah did you see how
much plastic yeah it's not pretty
yes or even like a Michael Jackson or
some [ __ ] like dude you know just
getting more [ __ ] up and more [ __ ]
up like these big people in Hollywood
are just addicted to plastic surgery and
like Botox and all this you've got to
set a hard rule you got to be like okay
I'm limiting myself to a grand total of
like two or three surgeries and that's
it and that's it can't go past it
because there's little like a little nip
and tuck like okay you can get it and it
might even look natural if you get one
or two things if you go beyond that who
you're rolling the dice man even Kim
Kardashian now starting to look like
really bizarre
well they I think the younger one got
her lips injected and then got them like
out and ejected or some [ __ ] like they
took two shits out well that's what she
said she was like oh I got it rid of it
and people are probably like no you're
just saying that but just like a [ __ ]
bartender can go to jail for like
serving someone that that drink that
puts them over a limit till I get them
in a car crash or some [ __ ] like you
know how bartenders are responsible like
for being the ones that serve the drink
yeah there's some level of culpability I
guess yeah
why not why can't we find like a little
Kim's doctor [ __ ] and Jaylyn be
like that doesn't look normal when she
came in to you the ninth time well
that's interesting cuz I said that's
unfair men I feel like that's on her cuz
like the dude who's doing and he's just
trying to make money so he's not gonna
he's gonna do whatever she wants you
know yeah but to app I mean like so a
drunk guy going up to the bar just wants
a drink yeah I mean listen I I don't
know how I feel about that bartender
thing to to be honest you don't think
the boy yeah I'm sort of against that
one also because there's always that
thing where they could have gotten
[ __ ] up at a house party or some [ __ ]
and then they go to a bar and order one
drink like stealing from someone don't
get me wrong it's the bartender should
at a certain point and honestly in to my
recollection I think most of them do
this where they do hit a point where
they're like you're good like I'm not
gonna ever seen that I've never seen I
don't think I've seen a bartender like
no you cannot you can't serve your buddy
maybe like someone who's like flopped on
the bar that's what I'm saying like at
that point it'd be like okay man you're
good but like so they should act
responsibly but I'm saying
legally holding them responsible because
somebody was a total [ __ ] idiot and
and tried to drive a car when they were
[ __ ] up I don't it's hard for me to
think of the bartenders being
responsible for that you know yeah I
guess that I mean that goes to that
whole like I listen to Jimmy door on
Rogaine and they were having a
discussion about what's the name Alex
Jones or whatever mm-hmm
about how they should have it should or
should not abandon from YouTube it's
almost like he got into the bar he's not
driving yet he's in a bar where you
serve alcohol can you not serve him you
know like do you have to remove him from
the bar like do you remove someone from
YouTube because they're being a being
you know basically drunk you know yeah I
mean I don't think I think YouTube is
insulated from any lawsuits that might
come Alex Jones way so like they're just
a platform if somebody has a problem
with that they have to sue Alex Jones
and there are laws
going on with Alex Jones right now but
this is something I was talking about -
I mean I'm the king of dunking on Alex
Jones but I didn't like the idea either
of banning him like I get the idea of if
you want to pull down specific very
specific things that were like okay so
let's say when he spoke about he said
Sandy Hook the shooting at Sandy Hook
was a conspiracy like if you want to
pull that it definitely if he if he ever
doxxed people like oh here the families
and their son didn't really die and
here's their address and here's their
name if he did that pull down that
segment immediately yeah sure yeah
anytime your daxing or actually
threatening violence I get pulling down
those segments but outside of those of
that I can't I can't agree to banning
him completely because it's just it's
beyond a slippery slope cuz we already
know that they're terrible at like
enforcing stuff like this objectively so
if we're gonna use it to come after
independent voices who have outsider
opinions I mean that's already the case
look what happened with ad pocalypse so
it's like you nobody should be begging
YouTube to [ __ ] censor more you know
indeed platform or any social media
apparently Alex Jones just just got
banned for seven days now on Twitter
Twitter was the last social media
platform that was like no he could still
use our platform it's you know but then
now they just for seven days I don't
know the exact reason they gave but for
seven days he's been suspended it's
almost like like those seven days are
gonna make him [ __ ] like realize what
a bad man he is anything to come back
and be like everything I said was wrong
and those seven days changed my life
well you know the other [ __ ] up thing
is what really happens in these
situations are reported on the fact that
his app became like the third or fourth
most popular app in all of Apple after
this that shows that it's almost like
now he gets more press because he's been
banned as a result of getting more press
more people know about him
I think people call this the Streisand
effect because they spoke about that in
that podcast would you mean or that
you're talking about how Barbara
Streisand sued some photographer for
taking a picture of her house
you can [ __ ] take picture of my house
and then that became national news and
then everybody knew where the [ __ ] her
house was when if she just let that dude
take the pictures and not sue him then
not as many people would have known so
there's kind of the same thing happening
with Alex Jones I mean he lost a giant
platform with YouTube but yeah it looks
like they might make it up in other ways
so I mean sense it just doesn't you know
when you ban something people want it
more it becomes exclusive it becomes
like you can't get it look at what
happened with the unite the right thing
so the last year there was the unite the
right rally and it was all these [ __ ]
crazy neo-nazi type people and that was
where Heather hire got ran over with the
car there was an act of terror or white
supremacist did that [ __ ] and then shows
the Charlottesville thing yeah and then
this year they had been the second one
the unite the right rally 2.0 or
whatever one of the guys who create it
was like no this isn't for neo-nazis we
don't want neo-nazis yah-yah-yah
whatever anyway long story short they
didn't ban it because we have free
speech in this country what happened
only 20 or 25 people showed up and then
there were thousands of counter
protesters and that's my point is that
if you just let it out they're usually
usually the reaction will be much
stronger than the initial negative stuff
you know mm-hmm
so did I think that's the best way to
address these things yeah I agree
son how big did I fail earlier with my
candy choice yeah you sent me a picture
of what do they even call the fries
jujyfruits those shits were made in 1917
all of them were made all of them were
they had excess stock like maybe 20
years ago someone found an abandoned
warehouse with those shits in them and
they're like [ __ ] it let's just sell
these shits again and they just have
been still ever since 1917 here's how I
would describe it imagine the taste of
Mike and Ikes
except significantly worse and then
imagine the Mike and Ikes being like 30
times harder than they are that's what
that's what you G for it is what the
[ __ ] was I thinking when I bought that
I'll tell you I'll tell you what was
going on in my mind first of all I saw
the picture of the box and I was like
that [ __ ] looks bangin okay but then I
knew on some level I knew like Kyle
every single time you've had those
shifts they've been so hard that it was
not a good idea to get those shits but I
was like but I remember them tasting
good even though they were hard and then
I thought well maybe when I got him the
last time like [ __ ] 10 years ago they
were just like worn some stale [ __ ] and
like but and then so I bought it and it
is this they were even more stale and
more hard than the last ones
and then the crazy thing is it didn't
even taste as good as I remember it
tasting like there's some that are good
but like there's a grape one and that
[ __ ] tastes like straight-up medicine
making ass cheeks mm-hmm it's just
[ __ ] it's so gross I'm like why did I
get this that is supposed to just be the
candy that you get on Halloween as like
a throwing yeah it comes in that little
[ __ ] yellow box your housing business
growing how was that company still in
business making they've got to be owned
by so like Mars company or some bigger
[ __ ] and that's just like their ass
cheeks candy that they just pawn off
what all this [ __ ] all the extra syrups
I'm the only person that bought that
since like 1999 yeah like I might get
something to mail from them like some
Willy Wonka [ __ ] [ __ ] like come to
our factory because you bought our candy
like you're mad well I'll tell you what
I tried though for the first time that
was really banging Heath bars
have you read heath bar I've been on
Heath bars since 88 that's my [ __ ]
unbelievably delicious and unbelievably
underrated Heath bars Bane and then have
you had peanut chews yes they're good
too peanut chews are [ __ ] I think
it's only an East Coast thing because
they don't know about it in Chicago and
every time I go back to New York my
friends like did you bring me a peanut
chew I'm like well let me ask you this
do you have you tried and do you like
Charleston shoes I'm torn on Charleston
shoes I'm like try it again son you'll
love them they're so like 67% on them
now they're good I remember my friend
first told me about it he was like
listen it's like a delicious chocolate
bar but it's got like marshmallow inside
and I was like I don't really [ __ ] with
marshmallows that much so this [ __ ] is
probably not gonna be that good and I
ate it and I was like this is the most
delicious [ __ ] I ever had in my life you
know are banging
frozen they're pretty good too but
peanut chews on my goat like I could
house a box of peanut like a like a
seven thousand box of peanut chews I'm
I love peanuts use I try his folks
person for peanuts I mean I wanted to
try new like candies that's why I tried
to Keith bar and bar so good i Lauren
dude I doubt this was one of those
things where I was like on the way to
checkout at the CVS and I just grabbed
Alexandria Ocasio Cortez did an
interview with Chris Cuomo on CNN and he
decided to Pelt her with right-wing and
establishment talking points the issue
here as you're about to see but I'll
explain after the clip it's all in the
framing take a look look beyond gender
we're talking about getting ahead of
ourselves we should be focusing on
gender very much but they want and if
you look at why the women won almost to
a person they were much closer to the
center and the traditional democratic
views than what we're seeing with some
of the other new crops you included do
you think that that is a reflection
about how much change your party can
take and how soon that more of those
candidates are winning because they're
healing more closely to traditional
democratic standards well I think you
have to take a look at two things where
the American people are at and then also
what wins campaigns and it's no secret
that while grassroots campaigns
absolutely are have have their place and
are very strong in voter turnout when
they are able to turn out voters money
does win elections and so when you have
you know PAC groups that are able to
pour in half a million to a million
dollars per race that absolutely makes
makes an impact however nothing changes
the fact that the majority of Americans
believe an approve of Medicare for All
single-payer health care seventy-four
percent of Democrats believe in Medicare
for all so I think that the electorate
and the American people are very clear
about what they value and what they want
but at the same time we do live in an
environment where money and unlimited
money wins a lot of elections and so
when you have organizations that are
able to you know write a blank cheque
that absolutely has an impact in races
but I think what we do know is that the
we are winning really hearts and minds
and we are winning an American consensus
on on where we are going for our future
you know there's that expression of
journalism that the truth you know that
democracy dies in darkness you need the
light of truth dies and dark money also
if you could get dark money out and you
can't yeah because the Supreme Court was
really clear on it and I'll have to see
if
Court sees it any differently I'm not
sure that it would dark money 100% that
is a nonpartisan issue then you get into
the partisan issue of money which is man
do you want to spend a lot of my tax
money on these proposals that you and
Bernie and others have Medicare for all
college tuition maybe even housing that
the green new deal that you have it is
all very expensive especially on the
single-payer side and that it gives
people sticker shock even in Bernie's
home state they got sticker shock they
couldn't get it done in his state
because of how expensive it is and that
was an eleven percent increase in taxes
nine to eleven percent even that was too
much for people how do you pay how do
you sell it so first of all the thing
that we need to realize is people talk
about the sticker shock of Medicare for
all they do not talk about the sticker
shock of our of the cost of our existing
system you know in a Koch brothers
funded store uh you know study if any
study is going to try to be a little bit
slanted it would be one funded by the
Koch brothers it shows that Medicare for
all is actually much more is actually
much cheaper than the current system
that we pay right now and let's not
forget that the reason that the Supreme
Court upheld the Affordable Care Act is
because they ruled that each of these
monthly payments that every day
Americans make is a tax and so while it
may not seem like we pay that tax on
April 15th we pay it every single month
or we do pay a tax season if we don't
buy you know these plans off of the
exchange so we're paying for this system
we Americans have the sticker shock of
health care as it is and we're also not
talking about is why aren't we
incorporating the cost of all the
funeral expenses of those who died
because they can't afford access to
health care that is part of the cost of
our system why don't we talk about the
cost of reduced productivity because of
people who need to go on disability
because of people who are not able to
participate in our economy because they
have accident because they are having
issues like diabetes or or they don't
have access to the health care that they
need I think at the end of the day we
see that this is not a pipe dream every
other developed nation in the world does
this why can't America and that is the
question that we need to ask we have
done these things before we write
unlimited blank cheques for war we
right a to Trent we just wrote a two
trillion dollar check for that tax cut
the GOP tax cut and nobody asks those
folks how are they gonna pay for it so
my question is why is it that our
pockets are only empty when it comes to
education and health care for our kids
why our pockets only empty when we
talked about a 100% renewable energy
that is going to save this planet and
allow our children to thrive we only
have empty pockets when it comes to the
morally right things to do but when it
comes to tax cuts for billionaires and
when it comes to unlimited war we seem
to be able to be to invent that numb
that money very easily and to me it
belies a lack of moral priorities that
people have right now especially a
Republican Party yeah she did very well
there and Chris Cuomo should be ashamed
of himself because he just put on a
master class in establishment [ __ ]
and listen it's not if I don't think he
did it on purpose I think that he has he
has adopted that framework as his actual
framework of reference I think that the
way he asked those questions it's
already embedded in his mind that these
what do you mean these are just a given
like my framing here's just a given
this isn't biased this isn't
pro-establishment this isn't a
right-wing framing but as I'm about to
explain to you and break down for you it
is exactly that and infuriating Lee so
so from the beginning notice that very
first question there he says well gender
aside and we shouldn't put gender aside
because it was all women who won he says
well the reason why these women won is
because they were more moderate
establishment candidates so he see what
he did there he hit to establishment
talking points in in one one of them was
ah we are us the establishment we are
actually so progressive in fact we're
maybe even more progressive than you
Alexandria Ocasio Cortes why because i
back women
I'm in favor of the women so in other
words mix feminism yet again
Micke feminism it's the bastardization
of identity politics for cynical ends
those ends being serving the status quo
and moderation which by the way the
status quo is actually not moderate so
it's extreme it's extreme in a
right-wing direction it's it's extreme
extremely biased in favor of the moneyed
interests but it's a way that they get
to say hey I'm lefty ER than now even
though I am literally not when you look
at the policies but I'm gonna Pat myself
on the back and Pat the establishment on
the back by saying oh we're so
enlightened because we have more women
candidates see so isn't isn't shouldn't
we all only care about identity and
shouldn't we care you know just about
surface [ __ ] because that's that's
the way you're more liberal even though
we want to serve the establishment with
those diverse faces so and then the
second part of that is establishment
candidates he's like flat-out saying it
like oh yeah they're more establishment
so that isn't that the way to go because
so many establishment candidates won now
notice something anytime establishment
candidates lose they never say it is
because they are establishment
candidates and that philosophy that
ideology doesn't sell never whenever an
establishment candidate loses to them
it's a fluke it's a one-off it's not
indicative of a larger trend now flip
the script whenever it's the opposite
it's because of their ideology that they
want an establishment candidate one it's
obviously because they love people of
the establishment it's got to be because
they love the establishment so in other
words it didn't even occur to Chris
Cuomo the obviously correct point that
Alexandria Ocasio Court has made which
is it's the money [ __ ] every time an
establishment candidate wins it's
because they flooded the airwaves with
ads they had more money they got their
name out there more so people probably
even know about the left-wing candidate
and the other instances in which the
and candidate wins it's because there
could be some genuine vote splitting on
the left like what happened with Abdul
el Syed and what's-his-face I forget his
name already founded are in in Michigan
so there was genuine vote splitting
because there were two left-wing
candidates and one establishment
candidate so the left-wing vote was
split and in the stash one candidate won
and thany dar by the way it was a
[ __ ] liar and that's the problem with
him not that he was in the race it's
that he's a [ __ ] liar and he was in
the race because he's not actually
left-wing he wanted he was a Republican
but he ran is like a Bernie Sanders
style Democrat so I mean look at that
it's always if the establishment wins
it's always because they're brilliant
and because that's what people want when
the left wins it's a fluke it's a
one-off it doesn't count that's
effectively what he's saying now he's
also just wrong on the facts here why
there were 12 our revolution candidates
that one and at least six justice
Democrats that one including female
justice Democrat candidates Talib is one
example Sarah Smith is another example
so there you go two female candidates
who are Justice Democrats and he's got
nothing to say about them nothing to say
about them in fact they don't count I
you did I mean you didn't do well did
you Alexandria Ocasio Cortes sure your
side is all grassroots funded is that a
giant money disadvantage it's harder to
get the name out there but I unit you
didn't do well because you're not as
popular as the establishment there were
over a thousand seats that were lost
under Barack Obama Chuck Schumer and
Nancy Pelosi and they never acknowledge
that and say hey maybe people hate the
establishment Donald Trump one running
an anti-establishment message against
the most establishment candidate ever
he never said hey maybe people hate the
establishment never happened Jesus
Christ and then okay then we get to she
talked about money in politics and
what's his response well okay well you
get dark money out I guess that's a good
thing but you can't get it out because
that's what the supreme court said and
then it's an even more contentious issue
to say we should get all money out
contentious among who Chris yes among
your circle that you run in with other
rich [ __ ] that make too much money
on TV it's contentious in your circles
it
not at all contentious among the
American people in fact depending on
what poll you look at it's over 80
percent or over 90 percent of the
American people that want money out of
politics not just dark money dark money
means people who donate but in
corporations and and billionaires who
donate but they get to hide their name
and just give the money so you don't
know who's given who but dark money's
not the problem see this was the Hillary
Clinton Hillary Clinton's old trick it
was like we need to make sure we get
dark unaccountable money out of politics
and everybody every gullible person we
go oh oh yes that's so true so great why
did you add the words dark and
unaccountable because what Hillary
saying is we need more transparency so
our politicians should be bought off but
we should know who's buying them off
that was her position money in politics
is fine just let me know who's buying
who off that's supposed to be the
position that supposed to be on the left
oh please the real left-wing position is
clean elections publicly financed
elections get all the private money out
of the system not the dark unaccountable
money the private money the money period
so it look at that framing the framing
is that naive pie in the sky you're
talking about getting dark money out
that's sure that might be a good idea
but the Supreme Court said no so I mean
what are we gonna do and then getting
money out all come on that's extreme no
what's extreme is the current system our
elections are bought in this country
that's why we have an oligarchy Chris
it's because billionaires and
corporations buy our politicians then
get favorable policy why do you think it
is that for example 63% of Americans
want Medicare for all and we don't get
it why is that over 90% of Americans
want a universal background check on
guns and we don't get it 58% of
Americans want free college and we don't
get it only 17% of Americans still want
to be in Afghanistan but we're still in
Afghanistan why do you think that is
Chris because the moneyed interests
they're doing what the moneyed interests
wants 80% of Americans want to raise the
minimum wage and the politicians haven't
raised the minimum wage why is that
Chris because the money in the system
the extreme system is what we have right
now but she looks at he looks at
Alexandria Ocasio Cortes like oh so
naive why don't you understand that the
status quo is what it is why are you
trying to make the system better Oh
gross
and then finally
the classic he does this all the time he
did it in an interview recently with
Bernie Sanders oh you sure do want to
spend a lot of my tax money now don't
you is expensive how do we pay for it
Donald Trump and Mike Pence just
announced a [ __ ] space force a
new branch of the military in space
did anybody say oh yeah you can't afford
this this is stupid pie in the sky
[ __ ] toddler like thinking nobody
said it and by the way there was it's
not like they brought it up and they
were like ok now let's debate it they
brought it up and they were like we are
doing the space force and the dumbasses
in a stylish media were like yeah I
guess we're doing the space force anyway
it sounds like good idea wasn't that
gonna be awesome guys as can be awesome
so like Alexandria points out giant tax
cuts for the rich that blow a
trillion-dollar hole in the deficit no
talk about deficit spending at all none
no talk about oh my god can we afford
this I don't understand corporate
welfare every year 80 billion dollars a
year go to the big banks as corporate
welfare trillion-dollar bailout of Wall
Street that just happened not that long
ago endless war seven trillion dollars
when all is said and done in Iraq seven
trillion all what does he have to say
we're trained to not bring up the cost
when it's stuff like that because we're
just supposed to grandfather that into
the way our system works you can't
question defense spending cost we love
the traps the traps I support are true
this is the ideology this is the mindset
he was trained to be a good little
establishment [ __ ] boy and that's what
he's doing and so whenever it's for you
education health care you can't afford
it you so naive [ __ ] unicorn fairy
dust so idealistic grow up grow up and
accept the status quo exactly as it is
Jesus come on they paid me well and
that's all it matters this is what's
going on inside his mind man it's
subconscious it's not on purpose
but he's totally drunk the establishment
kool-aid and he's clueless about it even
to the point where he brings up like Oh
Vermont tried to do single pay
Aaron they couldn't even get it done
there why Chris why do you think that is
because of a concerted establishment
effort to get them to not do it because
the private health insurance companies
we're gonna [ __ ] them over if they did
it that's why because it hurts their
bottom line the funny thing is as he
accuses Alexandria Ocasio Cortez the
subtext of everything he's saying is
you're so naive but you're the naive one
you don't even understand how giant
organized moneyed interests organized
capital how they can impact elections
and impact government for favorable
outcomes for their own pockets you don't
even understand that you're bringing up
that Vermont couldn't get a
medicare-for-all in their state a
single-payer system in their state
you're using that as evidence that
although single-payer systems can't work
every other developed country as a
single-payer system every other one
every other we have Medicare in this
country that ranks way more popular than
our private system why cuz it's better
cuz it's better even the VA which
everybody loves to shriek about the
problems of the VA even that ranks
better than our private system but he's
just all of the evidence third he backs
up his establishment position that's
what he just believes you know he
doesn't even understand that there's
counter evidence to it and then again as
she points out even according to a coke
funded study this saves what about a
trillion dollars over a decade I
originally said 300 billion it turns out
it's more than that so even according to
a right-wing funded study Medicare for
all saves a trillion dollars and he
still framed it as you sure do want to
spend a lot of my tax money don't you
well you sure want to spend a lot more
of your own money on health care don't
you because if you're saying I don't
wanna do Medicare for all I want to do
the system we currently have you're
spending more money and you're getting
worse health outcomes and 30,000 America
30 million Americans are uninsured and
up to forty five thousand don't have
basic health care and we pay double so
he doesn't he doesn't understand
anything but he just casually buys into
a right-wing framing and he's not even
correct when he says all you want to
spend a lot of my money no
she's actually proposing that we save
money and cover everybody and if you
gave a [ __ ] to do even a little bit of
homework you would [ __ ] know that
but you don't but that's okay cuz that's
why you're in the position you're in
because of what your last name is
nepotism that's why Cuomo's there Mario
Cuomo was the governor in New York
obviously andrew Cuomo is the governor
of New York right now
Cuomo Nate last name is big in politics
especially in New York that's why you
are where you are cuz your last name and
because you're willing to serve the
establishment shame on you
so Twitter decided to uptick their D
platforming and censorship campaign I
wish that was hyperbole but it's really
not so the other day
TJ Kirk also known as the amazing
atheist he's a youtuber with over a
million subscribers he had over a
hundred thousand Twitter followers um he
tweeted something that is without
question not even close
satirizing racism so there was the
recent case of Sarah Jean I think her
name is she was hired by the New York
Times and a bunch of right-wing
snow-flakes dug up her past tweets and
some of them were either very offensive
jokes some people would say offensive
jokes I don't give a [ __ ] about jokes oh
I don't know what I'd categorize them as
I would just say she's a silly person
but she said some stuff about how it
brings me pleasure to see old white men
in pain or something of that effect and
you know there were tweets that were
either jokes or you could say are
reflections of how she really feels and
she legitimately is uh not too fond of
white people well either way
TJ Kirk saw this high profile case it
was big news and he decided okay I'm
gonna satirize that so what did he say
white people are diseased they are aids
they are a pox upon the earth and
everything and every stinking cracker
one of them should die of every disease
at once so New York Times has about a
lucrative job at your paper I think I
have demonstrated the qualifications so
it's hard I can't even wrap my mind
around the idea that somebody might read
that and think it's serious I mean he
says every stinking cracker one of them
should die of every disease at once all
white people should die of every disease
at once even if you don't think it's
funny he is clearly being satirical and
poking fun at the tweet where Sarah
Zhang was
either seriously or semi seriously
expressing that notion it's not even
close it's not remotely close it is
beyond obvious you would have to pull a
totally out of context hack job and
misinterpret on purpose to not get that
like if you see white people are a
disease full-stop well then maybe I
could say okay perhaps you thought it
was serious cuz all you saw was white
people are diseased if you read the
whole tweet there's no again it's not
even close it's obviously satirical in
nature so where's the problem you're so
get this
Sarah Zhang who did the you know those
tweets some a similar tweet to this but
maybe was serious I don't know again
maybe she's joking maybe she's serious I
don't know again I don't care
but either way she was not pulled and
she didn't lose her job at the New York
Times now let me be clear I don't want
her to get pulled from Twitter and I
wouldn't even want her to lose her job
in the New York Times why because I
don't care I'm not
I hate call our culture and outrage
culture just everybody let it go let it
go you could say hey this is stupid or
this is wrong and here's why butts call
for people to lose their job or anything
like that it's just it's just stupid and
your priorities are misaligned and you
care about things that are just stupid
culture war sideshows as we have real
issues going on like wars and [ __ ]
corruption at the highest levels of
government with money in politics and
people don't have health care no less F
so let it go
but she is allowed to stay on Twitter
she's allowed to keep her job at the New
York Times TJ who was making fun of her
potential racism pulled from the
platform he appealed it he appealed the
decision guess what they were like nope
you're in violation of our Terms of
Service sorry you're spreading hateful
content you're banned
now again let me let me make another
parallel for you Alex Jones who has
recently pulled from YouTube and Spotify
and all that now I don't agree with that
I would have left Alex Jones up I've
explained you know reasons why I think
that is
but Alex Jones Twitter is standing by
Alex Jones
now if you're from my school of thought
you go okay credit to them on that one
you know even though there were
instances of him violating the Terms of
Service the question is hey doesn't
merit the the internet death penalty the
Twitter death penalty so they're
standing by him but they axe TJ when
again
TJ is doing satire here is making fun of
somebody who was maybe racist okay this
makes no sense
this makes no sense but this is what
happens we've now opened the door
we've now opened the door to censorship
and des platforming so just as I told
you from the beginning it's never gonna
be used in an objective way ever ever
ever because behind this all are human
beings human beings that have their own
personal biases human beings that are
not you know a perfect logic machines
and listen I don't want to muddy the
issue here because I really do think TJ
this example with TJ is a particularly
egregious example from Twitter and they
should reverse it immediately
immediately by the way this video at
Twitter support at Twitter support on
Twitter and tell them that say hey you
guys messed up with TJ you're gonna
you're gonna have to bring them back
this isn't a question I mean you
obviously [ __ ] up now be nice about it
but tell them hey you gotta put him back
on the platform what are you doing here
now again I don't want to muddy the
waters but I do want to give other
examples here because this is again you
we open the door to the censorship and
now there's no ending there's no
stopping it it's not a hey maybe this is
a slippery slope we're in the midst of
the slippage we're already like more
than halfway down that slope so this
also happened Twitter suspends proud
boys accounts ahead of the unite the
right rally now let me be clear about
something
proud boys they're this stupid goofy
dumb group that Gavin McGinnis has Gavin
McGinnis is a right-wing hipster douche
bag he's not cool he's not edgy I think
these are the biggest losers in the
world
I mean proud boys what it even sounds
like really stupid and pathetic so these
are the guys who were like yeah well
we're right wing and we're white and
we're proud about it we're not gonna
hide it what do you care brown white
whatever bro cool I'm cool with it relax
you're not a pressed [ __ ] chill out
but so I don't like this group I think
they're really stupid I've ripped Gavin
McGinnis a new [ __ ] like 14 times
before he went after MLK one time and it
was the dumbest thing I've ever seen but
putting all that aside what was the
reason that they gave for getting rid of
Gavin McInnes well here's what a Twitter
spokesperson said quote we can confirm
that these accounts have been suspended
from Twitter and periscope for violating
our policy prohibiting violent extremist
groups so just because they're a group
that has been deemed hateful now they
have they're not allowed to say anything
on Twitter and they are pulled down from
social media now again I don't like the
proud boys and I actually do think
there's a semi-legit angle to this claim
because as part of their induction
ceremony to be a proud boy it you have
to I think beat somebody up who's like a
leftist or something like that now I
don't know the details of it maybe
that's not true I don't know you have to
get their side of it also but from what
I've read that might be true that that's
part of the induction ceremony into
being a proud boy but they say because
of that their account is gonna be pulled
down Gavin McInnes his account is gonna
be pulled down nothing on the account
called for a direct threat of violence
nothing was liable libel nothing was
slander nothing was defamation
nobody even is arguing or saying that
that's the case they just say you're a
group we consider hateful by definition
so we're gonna pull you down well you do
know what's gonna happen don't you
all the groups that are antiva that are
against these people who are counted
protesting them what's gonna happen is
the right now gonna sit back and go it's
cool ban all of our accounts but then
you don't there will be no parity and
we're not gonna come after you in kind
so what'll happen is they'll you know
take three or four examples of anti feh
going too far potentially being violent
and they'll say well what happened
obviously Twitter has a left-wing bias
because they ban the proud boys so if
you guys want to be fair about this and
active about this well you're gonna have
to get rid of the left-wing violent
groups too so ante fuh forget it ban
them there's gonna be a campaign to try
to get ante fab and there's gonna be you
know black lives matter there are some
examples of some black lives matter
protesters marching and chanting what do
we want dead cops when do we want it now
so the right will point to that and say
hey you just banned the proud boys you
just ban these right-wing groups and you
said their group is violent by
definition because some people in the
group may be more violent so that's the
same thing with an Tifa that's the same
thing with black lives matter pigs in a
in a blanket fry em like bacon that's
another thing that some black lives
matter protesters said now is this
reflective of the entire group I would
argue no but that's not gonna matter
because once you start pulling people
down and you say by definition you are
violent there is no end to that it will
continue ad nauseam ad infinitum so
you're gonna have they're gonna come
after an Tifa they're gonna come after
black lives matter and maybe you don't
like antiva maybe you don't like black
lives matter so you go hey you know what
that's fine but it never ends the
censorship keeps going so that's why i
always try to point out to you guys that
while you must a fight it's fine to take
down alex jones he actually does hate
speech what the [ __ ] do you think a Ted
Cruz voter thinks when he's watching a
video of mine and I'm a ripping
fundamentalist Christians a new [ __ ]
what do they think oh that's lovely
speech and that's just a different
opinion from mine no they go this guy is
spreading hate speech he just called
fundamentalist Christians idiots he's
offending over a billion people on this
planet who are Christians and I will not
stand for that sir
there's no end to this and then by the
way even if let's say hypothetically
right now Jack who's the head of Twitter
says I don't buy your false equivalence
I don't think an Tifa and BLM are equal
- proud boys so I'm gonna leave aunt Eva
and BLM up how long is Jack gonna be the
head of Twitter what happens when the
next person who's not Jack becomes the
head of Twitter and then that person
might not have the same political
leanings as Jack
and they might lean more to the right or
they might be genuinely in the center
they might just for the sake of trying
to appear non biased they might say ban
every BLM account banned every ant Aoife
account guys it never ends once you open
this door to censorship ever and by the
way again I'm giving hypotheticals like
oh maybe it'll do this to an Tifa maybe
they'll do this to BLM it's not even
about a maybe they already did it to TJ
when he was clearly joking you don't
even have to like TJ Kirk you had but
you have to acknowledge that was a joke
and it was [ __ ] that he got pulled
down you have to acknowledge that and
the list goes on and on guys we've
already spoken about it remember the
height of ad pocalypse on YouTube well
there was a an article in The Washington
Post from a shady group called proper
knot and they said oh we made a list of
all of the outlets spreading fake news
during the 2016 election and guess what
those outlets Google deprioritized those
outlets that's why alternate for example
had a drop of about 70% in their traffic
same with truth out same with truth dig
same with counterpunch so there are all
these whenever they start censoring and
deep platforming they will always come
for independent media first now
sometimes people will like that because
they'll go oh well Alex Jones really is
an [ __ ] Alex Jones really is a fringe
character Alex Jones really is dangerous
but that's not about Alex Jones it's
about the principle of it it's about the
principle of it so we're already seeing
it we're in the middle of it right now
you know I don't know how else I can
warn you guys I keep trying to point out
that even if you agree with one of the
targets of this it never stops there
once you open the door that door is now
open so the answer in my mind is all of
these platforms they have to be
regulated as public utilities why
because number one they're too big and
number two the whole point of these
different social media
let's is speech so you don't get to say
like oh it's just it's just a private
company so they get to make their own
decision easier at forms Twitter and
Facebook YouTube is speech that's the
whole point of it
speech so on that alone I think there's
a good reason to have regulation to say
they should have to abide by free speech
laws and the Constitution the way that
the government has to so again regulate
them as public utilities on that alone I
think that's a good reason but never
mind once you bring in the angle of
they're too big they're [ __ ]
effectively monopolies now if you break
them up they don't function the same way
and it would become a different story I
know some people say hey break them up I
don't want to go down that road I'd
rather go down the road of just treat it
like it's the public square' regulated
as a public utility should be totally
free and open now don't get me wrong if
there are genuine examples of libel or
defamation which is written word libel
or slander whatever doesn't matter you
get the point if there are examples of
defamation or direct threats of violence
then yes if they violate the law of
course you could pull down those
particular videos those specific videos
sure absolutely
but outside of those clear-cut examples
we have to have rules that say hey
anything goes on the platform because if
not what are we doing what are we doing
here this is digital authoritarianism
that's what this is this is [ __ ]
internet tyranny
now again you might laugh and you muhaha
whatever is not affecting me right now
it's gonna [ __ ] affect you it is
gonna affect you 100% and remember
whenever you give either corporate
overlords or the government this kind of
power the logical ends of that it will
be them using it in order to maintain
their own power and silence dissent
that's always how it's used
always always always always always so
they're gonna say everything that's
[ __ ] oh my god if you're reporting on
the DNC emails that prove that the
primary was rigged hey we can
that fake news because that maybe came
from Russia and and that is unacceptable
that's information that shouldn't have
been leaked so that's fake news we're
gonna have to [ __ ] push you to the
corners of the internet D platform you
deprioritize you censor you
oh you're reporting on the wars well the
establishment agrees the wars are good
let me ask you a question when the
entire mainstream media was pushing for
the war in Iraq when the entire
mainstream media was calling torture
enhanced interrogation because Bush
wanted them to isn't that fake news are
they gonna see any consequences will
mainstream media see any consequences no
because the way this is used is it will
always be biased in favor of the
establishment and against independent
outlets and people sometimes who are
reporting the truth sometimes the people
are genuinely [ __ ] crazy but again
there's a price you pay to have the
truth tellers there and that price is
the freedom enough to have the crazy
people spew their nonsense to that's
what freedom is and freedom is better
than any kind of authoritarianism or
tyranny or censorship or D platforming
and listen now you see it's just a clear
example of oh well they sure [ __ ] this
one up of course they're gonna [ __ ] up
so many of them because you shouldn't be
begging Silicon Valley oligarch
billionaires to filter [ __ ] for you
Alex Jones was booted from YouTube and
iTunes and Spotify and I think a few
other platforms now I I did a segment on
this when it initially happened and you
know you guys know my thoughts on this
kind of stuff I don't I don't need to
rehash everything I said in that video
but I do have some updates for you and
then I do want to try to dig a little
bit deeper into this issue although I do
think it's gonna be difficult for me to
do that and really hit all the points I
want to hit I've been debating this
quite a bit on social media and there
are people that I genuinely like and
respect who disagree with me
so what that tells me is I didn't really
hit all the points that I should have
hit in the original segment I did and I
didn't really address all the concerns
of people who might disagree with me on
this issue now I I think I genuinely do
have an answer for every counterpoint on
this and I'm not just saying that I
really it's not like it's like I thought
about this issue a lot and I try to look
at all the evidence and so I think I've
thought through this as much as possible
and I try my best to be fair to the
other position um but I'm gonna try to
dig a little bit deeper into it now but
first let's start with what I think is a
very important update to the story take
a look
Infowars app surges in popularity on
Apple and Google Play stores
now we don't have data for his own
website but my guess is his own website
probably surged in you know traffic as
well so this gets to a point that I
think I left out of my other segment on
this but I'll make it now I don't even
think that the move that YouTube did and
iTunes did and Spotify and the rest of
them I don't even think that they're
even getting their desired result by
doing what they did so their whole thing
was okay well he's a menace and he's a
bad dude and he's spreading all these
terrible lies and slander and libel and
whatever
and defamation and so that's why we got
to do what we got to do here but okay if
your ultimate goal was to make it so
that fewer people see Alex Jones I don't
even know if that's what ends up
happening in fact it's it's very
possible although you'd have to do a
direct apples to apples comparison here
and get the exact numbers but I do think
it's very possible that it might make it
so even more people end up listening to
him and watching him because there's
this unintended effect where okay you do
a move like this and then rightly or
wrongly people are gonna go oh well if
you're censoring him he must be doing
something right there's a there's an
outsider edge to him and so you've made
it the it's the taboo effect you know
it's like when you tell kids like oh you
shouldn't never drink alcohol when
you're under 21 and then most of them
end up drinking alcohol or a lot of them
end up drinking alcohol because you've
made it this now this outsider thing
that's like oh it's rebellious to do
this and then people they tell you to go
[ __ ] yourself and it may end up that
more people end up watching his show now
again I want to be clear I'm not I don't
I'm not totally convinced of that
because you'd have to do a direct
apples-to-apples comparison I mean you
did have 2.4 million subscribers on
YouTube and so that's a huge thing to
just take away but the question is in
the long run because of what's been done
here will they basically rush to other
outlets where they can get his stuff and
listen that way and watch that way and I
think there's a decent chance that does
happen you know this is something that
Glenn Greenwald tweeted a video about
this Noam Chomsky effectively made the
same point where he said they've
criminalize a criminalized Holocaust
denial in Europe and so there's actually
more Holocaust denial in Europe in the
u.s. it's perfectly legal to deny the
Holocaust and it's almost like the
actual marketplace of ideas I know that
term has played out and it's goofy to
even say it but since it's totally legal
to deny the Holocaust here people end up
kind of naturally getting pushed to the
to the fringes and mocked ruthlessly and
defeated because we've allowed it to to
be 'men
you know it so you can have an honest
discussion it's not pushed to corners
where it's not rebutted and then it
attracts more people so when you just
allow people to do it there's this kind
of natural defeat that happens of those
fringe ideas so that's one point I want
to make and I didn't make that in the
previous segment I don't think that I
did about Alex Jones now let me enjoy I
just want to address a few more of the
points that were brought up to me in the
wake of what happened so again people I
respect have disagreed with me strongly
on this issue so and it seems to me like
probably the biggest point that's made
is they say hey listen man I'm all for
free speech but you just have to
understand what we're talking about here
is like genuine defamation and slander
and if there is genuine defamation and
slander well of course you know YouTube
can and all these private companies yeah
they could act because they don't want
I'm on their platform there there's some
liability going on here as well so
that's why they're acting on it now let
me be clear I'm not saying that you know
YouTube and and iTunes and whoever a
hell's kicked them off their platform
that they don't have a right to do what
they did with Alex Jones because there
they are a private company and they can
do what they want but my whole point was
number one is still the principle of
free speech at play so even though it's
not a literal First Amendment issue I
still think it's the principle of it at
play here but then also I think these
platforms are so giant and have so much
power that I think they should be
regulated as public utilities now other
people are saying oh well you should
break them up and you know that's the
other thing that happens when basically
you get monopolies you you know the idea
is we have any trust laws you should
break them up I'm more of a fan of just
regulate them like public utilities so
in other words treat Twitter and
Facebook like and YouTube as if it is a
government issue and to censor somebody
would effectively be the government
censoring it treat it like it's a public
utility that's my answer now again I
know people don't agree with me on that
but just understand that I am
acknowledging that right now it is not
the case that their public utilities
and they do have the right to do it I
just don't think they should do it and I
think they should be regulated as public
utilities but they do have the right to
do it now to directly address the
defamation and slander and libel point
okay my understanding was that and they
always point to all the Sandy Hook is is
the worst example of it now nobody has
been harder on Alex Jones over his Sandy
Hook denialism than I have in fact
nobody's been harder on Alex Jones
period on any issue that I have I mean I
I debunk him and mock him and it's
ruthless like at least once a week my
understanding though based on all the
videos I've seen of him and in fact a
compilation that I had played on the
show not that long ago of everything
Alex Jones said about Sandy Hook because
he now he does this tap - I never said
that no me no I never said that I never
said that well no we actually have the
video [ __ ] and you did say it and so
I played the clip of him
you know denying Sandy Hook happened
over and over and over and over and over
now again the points made well that's
you can't do that because what happened
is there were the families of these dead
kids have been harassed viciously by
Alex Jones fans and that's not so that's
breaking the law and by the way there is
a defamation case over this right now
it's happening right now
so we'll see what ends up happening in
that case but my understanding was he
never brought up anybody's name so in
other words he kept denying Sandy Hook
happened but he never mentioned the
families so by definition that cannot be
defamation because if all he's doing is
and again I know it's grotesquely
incorrect and wrong and he's a liar but
if all he's doing is denying Sandy Hook
well then to say that that equals
defamation because some of his fringe
listeners ended up then digging up and
getting the information and then going
after these people if it equals
defamation what he did then you would
effectively be banning discussing Sandy
Hook conspiracies because the argument
is hey just discussing these
is enough to get fringe people to then
dig up the information and then harass
these people what really should happen
is the people who dug up the information
and then harass them they should be
prosecuted for harassment and by the way
some of them were and that's the right
thing so in other words the people who
listened to Alex Jones and then decided
to take action and dig up those people's
information they're the ones who really
committed the crime
they have agency so it's not saying that
Alex Jones bears no responsibility for
it cuz on a personal level and an
ethical level he should feel
responsibility for it because it may
have been his segments that sparked
those people's interest to then go dig
up their information and go after them
but you can't legally there's no way you
could hold him responsible because he
didn't mention them by name so
effectively what we would be saying is
even discussing this conspiracy at all
is basically illegal which I think
honestly is a crazy precedent to set
because then okay there's also 9/11
conspiracies and you know what happens
if because of the 9/11 conspiracies you
have family members the people who died
9/11 who were harassed and again what if
they didn't bring up names would they
just spoke about the conspiracy and then
people took action and went after you
can't hold him liable because he didn't
mention anybody by name you have to hold
the people accountable who have agency
and then dug up the information and you
can go down the rabbit hole there what
about when it you know Bill O'Reilly
said on Fox News tiller the baby killer
over and over talking about George
Taylor the abortion doctor and then
somebody murdered George Tiller
now again he could be ethically
responsible on some level because that
may have sparked that person to then go
take action on their own and do it but
you can't you can't govern speech in a
way that tries to regulate what people
might do if they maybe are inspired by
what you said because then it's just you
can regulate so much stuff man you have
to hold those individuals responsible
now let me be clear I saw somebody sent
me an hour
that said that was it was in about the
court proceeding with Alex Jones in this
defamation case and it is claimed in
that suit that Alex Jones indeed did
give away some of their personal
information now again I've never seen
that and I cover Alex Jones very
extensively and I've seen the
compilation of him talking about Sandy
Hook being a hoax over and over and over
and over and over and over and over so
but so I don't know if that's actually
true or not that he gave away the
personal information
I thought it was not at all true it
turns out it might be true because there
are allegations of that again I haven't
seen the evidence but if he did do that
well then 100% without a doubt you take
down those videos so that that's the
other angle to this which is even if I
submit even if I even if I give
everybody on the other side of this
argument if I say okay I'm gonna grant
you all your points what I don't
understand is how you can justify
pulling down a library with thousands of
videos when it's obviously not the case
that every single one of those videos
violated Terms of Service and was
potential defamation or libel or slander
you could pull down those individual
videos but again it's like it's almost
like he got the internet death penalty
for what he did here and I'm willing to
make this prediction now and I'll by the
way I'll be very happy to eat my words
if and when time wrong so the defamation
case going on with Alex Jones and the
Sandy Hook parents I think Alex Jones is
gonna win that case because I don't
think people really understand how hard
it is to prove defamation or libel or
slander we have the most lenient free
speech laws anywhere in the world we
lean so heavily on the side of free
speech and again I think that's the
proper standard so on other things
people have pointed out to me is hey
look at this video it's like he's
threatening Robert Muller Hey look at
this video it's like he's threatening
Adam Schiff and every time I watch the
video I walk away going not only is that
not you know like direct threats of
violence as people are claiming in those
instances it's not even close
because he's the master of giving
himself wiggle room Alex Jones is now
again it's not to say he's not ethically
wrong in those videos cuz I think it
that is true but he can't legally be
held responsible as I think we're about
to see and he's clearly going to the
borderline but then reeling it in a
direct threat of violence would be I
Alex Jones I'm going to physically
assault Adam Schiff and I'm gonna do it
on Wednesday at seven o'clock when he
gets out of his meeting and his meeting
is being held at this address in
Washington DC like that's what we really
when they say no direct threats of
violence that's what it means it's not
like a vague like hey man I'm gonna
maybe kick your ass or if I were to see
him and he were to get in my face I
would tell him X Y & Z so every my point
is guys every video I've seen of Alex
Jones and I've covered so many and I
know you know that it's always
borderline it's always like okay I'm
gonna say things that are clearly
unethical but it's not gonna cross the
line into illegal and it's gonna always
give me enough wiggle room to be able to
get out of it later so and by the way he
did he settled out of court for the
pizza gate conspiracy um so they struck
some sort of a deal there that might
happen also in the Sandy Hook case I'll
be curious to see what happens there
but the way I see it I've just never
seen any evidence of him actually
breaking the law and again we could say
ethically he's gone too far in many of
these instances but I don't think it's
enough to hold him responsible and I do
think that and here's the main point
once you open this door it's not like oh
hey maybe it's not like a slippery slope
argument like oh it maybe will hit the
left and will hit us hard no it's
already happening we've already seen
examples of it so for example 75% of the
crackdown on free speech on college
campuses is a crackdown against the left
and let me be clear that's not the left
centering the left that's the left being
Center censored because in the study
that I was citing they give the examples
if you go to the direct source they give
the examples of who's being censored and
they go on to explain a lot of it is
people who have said critical things of
Trump
either being fired or not being allowed
to speak at school so either being deep
platformed or being fired a lot of it is
people who promote BDS and their
pro-palestine they get you know D
platform or they get fired or censored
so it's the right censoring the left
when it comes to Facebook we've already
seen examples of it there was a counter
protest to the unite the right rally
which is a gathering of far-right
figures and the counter protest was
pulled down and Facebook said oh we
think it's aiding and abetting like
Russian propaganda or something they're
like we're not Russian propaganda
we're left-wing counter protesters so
you have to understand I'm not giving a
slippery slope argument like oh maybe if
they go after Alex Jones it may be kind
of sort of might at some point affect
the left I'm saying it already is
affecting the left and the only way to
fight back against this is to not say if
I like the target of the censorship then
I'm okay with the censorship it's to say
hey maybe this whole premise of
censorship is not okay so for me here's
what I'm comfortable with
whatever the law is is where we actually
draw the line so if it turns out Alex
Jones actually did violate you know
actually did defamation for example and
has proven in the court of law and we're
gonna know at some point whether or not
that's true then I get it and I would at
the very least I would understand
pulling down those specific videos where
he does that of course but outside of
things that are actually illegal I hate
the idea of let's pull down his entire
channel because that is censoring that
is de platforming that may actually
attract more people to Infowars in the
long run and it's open the door in a
very clear-cut way to go after people
you like and you appreciate remember
jimmy dore has already been labeled a
conspiracy theorist people are saying oh
it's unfair to compare jimmy dore and in
kyle kolinsky to alex jones well yes and
no it's unfair from a substantive
perspective of course but it is totally
fair from an outsider perspective to do
that because we've already been compared
to him
specifically Jimmy was referenced in a
CNN article alongside Alex Jones as a
conspiracy theorist because of what he
said about Syria
hey we should wait for an investigation
before the bombings ah conspiracy
theorists what so it's not that like
people they think that's a counterpoint
like oh you're nothing like Alex Jones
so it's okay I know we're nothing like
Alex Jones of course I do
but the question is does it outsider
know and they don't if Jimmy's put right
alongside Alex Jones in a [ __ ] CNN
article and he's called a conspiracy
theorist they're directly comparing him
and this is this the same algorithm
algorithm that totally demonetised me
and David Pakman and Jimmy Dore what is
it about half a year ago now a year ago
over ad pocalypse so one craft ad gets
on a [ __ ] Nazi Channel and then me
and David Pakman and Jimmy Dore lose all
of our funding for two weeks because the
dumbass algorithm on YouTube
can't differentiate between pro-nazi
[ __ ] and people like me who are
debunking Nazis and mocking Nazis this
is the algorithm we're talking about
these are the tech overlords we're
talking about and you want to give them
the authority to just willy-nilly delete
channels because they're feeling public
pressure I mean come on man come on this
is never going to be used in the way it
will always here's the main point the
censorship will always be used more
often than not to target people with no
power people who are part of
marginalized communities and people who
might be genuine outsider truth tellers
now in the case of Alex Jones he of
course is not a truth teller I shouldn't
even have to say this because you know
my record on Alex Jones but I think the
broader point stands
so election results are in from Tuesday
at least most of them are we have losses
for the left and we have victory
victories for the left this is not
something that's being reported on in
the media in fact all of the headlines
on this are totally misleading when
people say and you'll see this all over
the place now
Alexandria Ocasio Cortez's movement
fizzles no wins for the Ocasio Cortes
endorsed candidates that is not true and
it's not even close so it is true that
there are some of the candidates that
she endorsed and campaigned for
high-profile ones that did not win but
because these mainstream media
organizations are insanely lazy they
don't look up whether or not that
broader statement is correct the broader
statement being oh all of her candidates
lost but you know you would think you
would think that maybe if you are a
so-called journalist or reporter in a
mainstream media organization you know
you would see how our revolution did see
how justice Democrats did but no I'm
convinced that their people today still
reporting on Alexandria Ocasio Cortez
who don't even know she's justice
Democrat and don't even know what
justice Democrats are so you know it
they suck at their job and they're also
lazy the mainstream media
okay so first let's discuss the downside
I'll give you guys the losses Cori Bush
lost in Missouri against lacy clay that
was a long shot race from the beginning
and and you know we knew that going into
it we have Abdul el Sayid lost for
Michigan Governor now I'm gonna come
back to that one in a second because
it's it's disheartening what happened
and how it happened and there is
somewhere to place the blame and it's
not on Abdul okay and then also we had
Brent welder lost in Kansas
now that was a little bit of a
questionable situation that went on over
there so they have new voting machines
the new voting machines
apparently malfunctioned [ __ ] the bed
when Brent welder was up in the race and
growing his lead and then when the
malfunctioning machines started you know
recalibrating and and calculating the
votes
shocker Brent welder ended up losing so
you know people look at that and they're
like wow that's mighty convenient the
anti-establishment candidate was winning
and growing his lead and then all of a
sudden there was a problem with the
machines and Brent welder ended up
losing now you know am I out here making
declarative and definitive statements
like this was obviously some sort of you
know rigging or some sort of conspiracy
I can't make that claim because I don't
have evidence all I'm saying is that at
face value when you look at it
circumstantially yeah it doesn't it
doesn't look good that looks weird
that's not cool
so if that one was a little bit of a
heartbreaker because it looked like he
was gonna pull it out there was a
tremendous amount of momentum behind him
coming into the election I mean a
tremendous amount of momentum so that
one hurts now back to Abdul el Saeed for
a second there's a guy named Sharif a
Nadar now I think it is a completely
fair statement to make to say he spoiled
it for Abdul Sayid and in fact turned
the election over to Gretchen Whitmer
the more establishment candidate who
ended up winning now people have pointed
out online they said well hold on now
how is this how can you say that when
that's the claim that the corporatist
make and the centrist make against Jill
Stein like Oh Jill Stein spoiled the
election for Hillary Clinton well
there's a very very big difference
Shariff a nadar is a liar so I've never
ever ever
gone after honest actors in elections
even if you know those honest actors may
have happened to split the vote on the
left and then ended up hurting the left
and helping Republicans I you you will
be hard-pressed to ever find a situation
where I've gone after an honest actor
because I believe in democracy so that
means you know you can run a campaign
that's a center-left candidate and
you're open and honest about that and
you can run a campaign that's populist
left and there could even be another
candidate that's populist left as long
as both of them are telling the truth
about what they believe and they're
genuine I'm not going to attack them
even if the fact that there are two
populist left candidates ended up
splitting the populist left vote and
turning it over to the right or turning
it over to a corporate Democrat you can
never be mad at any of the candidates
because they're genuine and so democracy
means hey you want to run and try to
represent the people and put your
philosophy out there by all means I
can't attack you and say oh you spoiled
the election for them if you're an
honest actor the reason why I'm very
comfortable attacking Shri Thanatos and
saying he spoiled the election for Abdul
is very simple he's he ran on this
platform of I'm the candidate that's
most like Bernie Sanders he even said in
an ad I'm the furthest left candidate
well the intercept did some fantastic
reporting and it turns out this guy but
behind the scenes was like I'm not sure
I run as a Republican or should I run as
somebody as a Democrat and you know I
mean I've donated to Republicans in the
past I lean right so why shouldn't maybe
I should run as a Republican oh no all
the energy is on the burning wing of the
Democratic Party so now I'm gonna I'm
gonna try to run as a Bernie Kratt and
I'm gonna say I'm the furthest left
candidate in this race now you might
know that he's a liar because you've
seen that intercept article before or
you've heard me talk about him before I
guarantee you the overwhelming majority
of the people who voted for him had no
idea that he was a Republican
he had donated to Republicans in this
race he was considering running his
Republican before he decided to make a
political calculation and lied to people
and say I'm a Bernie sander style
Democrat so that's how this is different
it's different because he spoiled the
race and he lied that's why I can say
he's spoiling the race it's not spoiling
the race if you're running is another
left-wing candidate and you're honest
because then that's just called
democracy you get to run because you're
being honest even if that does happen to
split the vote on the left this is he's
splitting the vote on the left but he's
lying so the problem is that he's lying
that's the problem is that he's a
[ __ ] liar he's a fraud that's the
problem so I'm very comfortable blaming
tree for Abdul's loss because you know
like I said the overwhelming majority
people who voted for him they were
thinking they probably saw that ad where
he said I'm the furthest left candidate
in the race and they're like okay I
guess that's the furthest left candidate
in the race I'm gonna vote for him when
Abdul was the real Bernie Sanders style
candidate he was a justice Democrat and
of course he would have been fantastic
by the way he ran a tremendous race and
it's a shame that you know sure he did
what he did here okay now so those are
the losses now those are the ones that
the media's gonna focus on say ah see
the left the left obviously is not going
to be you know they're not gonna win
that's not the direction the Democratic
Party should go in so before I even tell
you the victories of the Justice
Democrats let me point this out Baldr
sin versus O'Connor that was a very
high-profile race it was getting a lot
of attention now none of them are
justice Democrats you had ball derson
who's the Trump endorsed Republican
O'Connor who's a corporate Democrat a
centrist Democrat and O'Connor like
openly ran on that he's like I'm not a
socialist I don't believe in Medicare
for all I'm a centrist I believe in
compromise so that's O'Connor the media
was saying Oh obviously O'Connor is
gonna win because there's this anti
backlash guess what happened
Boulder's in 1 now it is a Republican
plus 11 district and in the end it looks
like ball erson wins by about a point or
less than a point so they're the
hilarious thing is when corporate
Democrats lose as O'Connor did this is
still somehow going to be evidence of
corporate Democrats or the way to beat
the right okay but they didn't do that
they didn't be the Trump endorsed
Republican the Trump endorsed Republican
beat the corporate Democrat so how can
your takeaway be Oh corporate Democrats
are better to take on the right then the
left is but they didn't win
yeah but they they surged back it was a
Republican plus 11 district and now it's
just a Republican plus one district okay
so then be comfortable with losing every
race by one I mean so in other words the
most high-profile case of you know a
corporate centrist Democrat the
neoliberals the most high-profile case
that dude lost but this election is
somehow being spun as a lost for the
populist left hilarious now let's get to
the victories for the Justice Democrats
so we have justice Democrat Robert
Davidson he won in Missouri second
District you probably haven't heard
anything about this guy in the media at
all you have of course from illage aya
Paul who won her primary she's an
incumbent justice Democrat along with of
course Rokon and Raul Grijalva you have
Jamie Schoolcraft who won in Missouri
7th district again sure you haven't
heard any anything about this guy you
have James Thompson James Thompson who
won in Kansas his fourth district this
is another high-profile Justice Democrat
you know in terms of how much he was out
there
his name was honestly out there just as
much if not more than Cory Bush so Cory
Bush lost but they're focusing on the
Cory Bush lost but you know James
Thompson's win you don't see anything
about it in fact they they say oh
there's no no Alexandria Ocasio Cortes
movement candidates ended up winning
what are you talking about it
five and there's one other that's a
potential win we still don't know
because there's voting machine issues
weird how that works again but at least
five justice Democrats won James
Thompson one of the more high-profile
ones and then there's a Rasheeda Talib
who's in Michigan's 13th district she's
a justice Democrat and she won as well
now this one's getting a little more
press because the press can use it for
identity politics reasons and they're
like oh the first female Muslim
candidate that's gonna be elected to
Congress okay that's wonderful I care
more about her policy positions and the
substance and it turns out on the
substance she's wonderful and she's a
justice Democrat so they're focusing on
almost none of our victories and in fact
they're they flat out factually wrong
when they say oh there were no victories
for the left that's not true and on top
of all that how many candidates did our
revolution have that one about twelve so
you have five justice Democrats winning
potentially six in the end twelve are
revolution candidates winning some of
them very high-profile of course we had
some losses too but it's being spun as
oh obviously the left can't take on
Donald Trump and the corporate centrist
or the way to go even though in those
high-profile case of a corporate
centrist versus a Trump endorsed
Republican the corporate centrist lost
so it's this is being spun in a thousand
ways it's so hilariously sad how many
people have fallen for that argument the
the all the headlines Oh Alexandria
Ocasio cortezes candidates lose that's
not true it's not true
stop saying it stop believing it do your
[ __ ] research and you know listen I'm
upset about Brent welder and Abdulle
else I even but you win some you lose
some man you win some you lose some and
remember we are at a permanent
disadvantage in terms of the money
situation you have to keep that in mind
that's
not a little thing that's a really big
thing in the case of in the case of
Alexandria Ocasio cortez she was able to
override that difference through just
boots on the ground and hard work but
that's not that's not the norm that's
not the general rule in fact that's an
exception to the rule
so just keep that in mind that you know
other cases for example Paula Jean
Swearengen she was drowned out by the
money others were drowned out by the
money so it's always gonna require it's
unfair because it's a it's a hundred
yard dash and the corporate Democrats
start on the 70 yard line and we start
on the at the beginning so it's unfair
but we have to play the hand that we're
dealt and that means we have to work
even harder that means we have to get
the name out there even more that means
we have to raise more small dollar
donations for these candidates that
means we need to have more boots on the
ground and knocking on doors and making
phone calls and all that stuff but I
just want everybody to know don't let it
take the wind out of your sails there
were some cases here that were losses
but you're never gonna win every one and
you just have to keep fighting and what
the thing is guys the establishment is
relying on you to throw your hands up
and say [ __ ] it ah we didn't win Bren
welders won [ __ ] it so we're done with
this I'm not gonna be involved in this
nah we didn't wind up doing else I even
once [ __ ] it you know whatever
no they're relying on that that's what
they want and you're actually
unwittingly doing the establishments
bidding if you end up giving in to that
urge that sensation we all get it it
happens all the time everybody gets it
it's an initial gut reaction of like
really really all this [ __ ] work and
we know we have the right candidate and
it didn't pan out
well [ __ ] this then that's exactly what
they want so we have to have to have to
have to keep fighting and then
eventually we'll keep winning
don't believe the lies don't believe the
[ __ ] it's not as bad as they're
making it seem so we fight on let's
continue
so I was on Fox News again yesterday I
was honestly very surprised that they
invited me back on and given that the
first time I was on I was screaming for
the war in Afghanistan to be ended among
other things these are not opinions that
you know they're very open to on Fox
News but nonetheless they let me in the
lion's den and I unleashed the first
time somehow got invited back on I have
this conspiracy theory that the
producers are secretly leftists at Fox
News and in fact there are some evidence
for that conspiracy theory because you
know every time they've done a graphic
on Alexandria Ocasio Cortez like they
did on Hannity show they put up for
policy platform and all the things look
wonderful because they are and then
Hannity reads it and goes oh isn't this
scary Medicare for all free college
supporting LGBTQ people and it's just
all things that are like duh those are
good ideas so I think the producers
might be secret leftists and that's why
they're inviting me on but either way I
digress I had more fun this time than I
did the last time because this time I
think there were more fireworks now
having said that there are also more
points of clarification that I have to
give um after this most recent interview
so if you haven't seen it you know you
could check it out in the other clip or
here I'm gonna show you the whole clip
again now it's about five or six minutes
so let's watch and then we'll come back
and I'll give you my breakdown
look if the Democrats get in they're
gonna raise your taxes you could have
crime all over the place you're gonna
have people pouring across the border so
why would that be a blue wave I think it
could be a red wave I tell you what
there's the prediction president Trump
last night in Ohio campaigning a special
election for the House of
Representatives that takes place on
Tuesday ahead of the midterms the
president says he will be on the trail
almost every day here to discuss talk
radio panel Chris Stigall on the Left
Kyle kolinsky on the right you will soon
learn that that is not where their
political positions are but that is
where they are on the television screen
all right Chris to you the president
seems to feel as though he's got a
winning strategy here in saying that
Democrats are too far to the left to be
part of the mainstream for traditional
crossover voters winning strategy I
don't think he has to say it I think we
just have to listen to them I mean this
chaos that you've been reporting on this
weekend that went on in Portland with
the ice facility there with candidates
in New York calling ice agents Nazis and
calling for the shutdown of ice the
Sarah Jang woman who's now an editorial
board member of the New York Times
calling out you know whites and white
men particularly and making some really
despicable comments I mean they're
they're truly unhinged in a way we've
never seen I don't think Trump has to do
much heavy lifting frankly let them do
all the talking Kyle should moderate
Democrats worry about this far left push
no I think that the far left is actually
the way for Democrats to win believe
they're not so when you look at the
polls and you look at all the
substantive policy issues the American
people overwhelmingly support Medicare
for all for example they overwhelmingly
support free College they overwhelmingly
want to end the wars so when you go
issue for issue the American people are
actually with the far left and in fact
President Trump when he ran in 2016
stole some of those issues he ran
against the wars he ran against the
trade deal and anything Kylie might you
a point he also said he wasn't going to
touch any of the entitlement Social
Security right or Medicare you make a
good point in terms of where the
Democratic Party is headed there's a lot
of Democratic socialists beginning in
New York that have started to knock
folks off longtime Democrats
Tuesday's primary in Missouri Cory Bush
Democratic Socialist taking on lacy clay
longtime Democratic congressman if there
comes a question though in terms of how
palatable across the board these folks
are not just in primaries interview with
cory bush from about two weeks ago and
then we'll get your guys reaction
roll it the wealthy should pay their
fair share yes what is a fair share what
percentage so you're saying that forty
you're you're saying that they're paying
their fair share is what you're saying
no I'm asking what percentage is a fair
share their fair the same if I'm paying
if a third if my money is going to taxes
then I think a third of their money
should be going it does well it does I'm
trying to understand because you realize
the effective tax rate on the poor is
less than it is on the rich right okay
so first of all I'm not the poor I'm
very close to their line but I'm not the
police the effective tax rate the
effective tax rate on the middle class
okay is less than it is on the rich
correct what fair share would you like
to change the tax rate to on the
wealthiest what percentage of Americans
so it's a fair share so let's say the
wealthy one percent could pay let's say
if they pay less is given 45% child is
that the future of the Democratic Party
I hope it's the future of the Democratic
okay Jeff Jeff Bezos has over 100
billion dollars at the same time now we
have 60,000 homeless veterans in this
country and 400,000 homeless Americans
and the American people again to go to
the polls overwhelmingly want to raise
taxes on the rich overwhelmingly want to
raise taxes on Wall Street corporations
I'm talking about 58% of Americans isn't
so if your strategies to defend the rich
by all means go right ahead Chris
I'm guessing you just really hope that
Cory bushes the future of the Democratic
Party
oh these mathematicians are brilliant
this is this Alicia acaso Cortez before
her there these are wonderful
spokespeople as I said in the open let
them keep talking by the way it's not
like we're talking math and economics
with the most of the time although when
they do that's pretty golden we're still
talking about radical French stuff
abolishing ice abolishing law
enforcement you know polishing lawns
listen why are you making things up
that's made up you just made that up
who says abolish it yes you just made
about horsemen nobody you did is i
excuse me
is ice not law enforcement Customs and
Border Protection already protects the
border ice was created in 2003 and by
the way their allegation one second in
Kyle you made it you made a point about
polling ending ice or abolishing ice
does not play well in polls in the
Heartland that is not a popular thing in
Michigan in Ohio and in Missouri that's
correct but that's because we need to
make the argument and for example like I
just referenced before I was being
talked over there are allegations of
literal slavery happening at private
prisons run by acts you're laughing it
was in The Washington Post it's been
proven for guns it was proven court of
law there's merit I'm trying to figure
I'm still trying to figure out how we
got from there to here
we will dissect that in the postmortem
meantime fellas we got to run it was
great having you both on here Wow break
it up I'm correct great conversation
Rick all right Chris Kyle thank you
appreciate it fellas yeah so like I said
I I I had more fun this time around the
last time around there were fireworks
but I actually enjoyed the fireworks it
makes you feel like alive and focused
and and sharp and ready to respond so
let's break this down
the elephant in the room is obviously
the cory bush clip so when they played
that clip let me let me be clear up
front yeah it's obvious that she fumbled
that question like it's not the point is
so
obvious that I didn't even feel the need
to give a nod to that point because the
clip fix speaks for itself
and honestly I think if you talk to Cory
Bush in a moment of sheer honesty she'll
tell you yeah I fumbled that question I
didn't answer that question well now
there perhaps may have been a little bit
of misleading Fox News editing in there
there was a cut at a peculiar point I
don't know if you guys caught that but
if you go back and check it out you can
see it and I don't want to throw cory
bush under the bus overall because I
think the point to stress was the point
that I did stress there which is her
overarching point is undeniably true see
if I had if I if they came back from
that clip and asked me about it and my
immediate reaction was yeah you're right
she fumbled that question now what I
would be saying is stylistically she
fumbled it but the main point is
substantively she's actually correct but
if they come back from that clip and I
say yeah she fumbled that question
that's it everybody in in the Fox News
audience shuts their brain off and goes
aha see so Cory Bush is a bad candidate
her message is obviously wrong in other
words there's a lot that that goes
hand-in-hand with making that point up
front and it's actually a brilliant
propaganda trick a clever propaganda
trick the way that they presented that
because it's not like they steal man
their opponent's argument it's not like
they play a clip of Noam Chomsky
dissecting why a progressive tax system
is obviously superior and better for the
people compared to a you know a flat tax
or any other kind of tax system so they
don't lead with a strong argument from
the other side they lead with something
that's obviously comical and something
that's supposed to portray the entire
left-wing position as goofy and silly
and stupid so I was at it as I'm
watching that Cory Bush clip I'm at a
crossroads in my mind I go okay there's
a myth there's many ways I can respond
to this what's the best way to respond
to this and the first thing that came
across my line was of course to just
admit up front like yeah she didn't
she answered that question poorly that's
a given but I didn't want to say that
because by the end of the clip she
actually gave a reasonable answer they
were like hey what's the what should the
the tax rate be on the top one percent
she goes I don't know forty five percent
if that whole if the clip was shown and
it was just that and it wasn't all the
pauses and the awkward thinking in
between again that would be a perfectly
reasonable answer I mean the top tax
rate on the rich is thirty five percent
right now it was thirty nine percent
under Obama it was forty percent under
Bill Clinton forty five percent
honestly just goes back to what it was
through most of the golden age of
economic expansion in the u.s. under
Eisenhower the top tax rate was ninety
one percent now that was just the
nominal rate that wasn't the effective
rate the effective rate was actually
about forty five percent that was the
actual amount and again we're talking
marginal rates here not overall rates
that's another important point but I was
at a crossroads I had to think okay
what's the best way to respond to this
and again her fumbling that question was
so [ __ ] obvious I didn't even feel
the need to be like hoho you guys got
her cuz that's so like it's like does
she didn't answer that question well me
being a policy guy being a substance guy
what did I do
I decided you know what I'm gonna do
here I'm gonna go over the top on them
and I'm gonna go over the top on them
for a very simple reason the overarching
point is correct they're trying to
portray it they're trying to to make
this subtle argument the subtext of this
argument is oh obviously all the people
who want to raise taxes on the rich
they're just these hordes of irrational
and lazy lefties who don't know what
they're doing don't know how to manage
an economy don't know their ass from
their elbow and they're all dumb that's
the point they're trying to make so the
best way to counteract that is a little
bit of a shock to the system well oh is
this the future of the Democratic Party
Kyle yeah I hope it's the future I hope
it's the future and then I tried to give
an example that really is gonna burst
through so that even though everybody's
shocked when I say that at first that if
they just hang on with me for the next
ten seconds of my point that they're
gonna go oh actually
a very reasonable thing that Kyle just
said so admittedly I went over the top
and I said yeah I hope that that's the
future and the very next point was Jeff
Bezos has over a hundred billion dollars
at the same time we have 60,000 homeless
veterans and 400,000 homeless Americans
so yeah you know what we need a little
bit of redistribution [ __ ] and I think
that's actually a very common-sense
position and a very straightforward
position so that was my my line of
thinking there if I had come out and
stated the obvious number one it's
obvious already that she fumbled in that
clip but number two that's it after I
say that they already win because of how
they framed the argument how they
presented it how they strut it they
didn't steal man their opponent's
argument they took the worst example
their opponent's argument and put that
forth so if I were to say yeah she
answered that question poorly what
people are gonna hear even though it's
not what I'm saying what they're gonna
hear is the idea of raising taxes on the
rich is stupid that's what they're gonna
hear and I was not gonna give them that
so I tried to basically go over the top
of them swap that aside and say listen
yes she's right on the overall point
raise taxes on the rich oh and another
thing that was bouncing around in my
head as I'm watching the cory bush clip
is leland the host who was questioning
her in that clip he's not even correct
but this was a point that unfortunately
was too complex for me to make on air
because there's no way i would have been
able to get all of it out before i got
cut off but I can make the point here
which is the benefit of having my own
platform he said oh the rich are already
paying more than the poor and the
reality is sometimes yes sometimes no
not at all so for example many rich
people pay the capital gains tax they're
not paying the income tax and this is
what happened I always use this example
because it's a perfect example this is
why Mitt Romney was so hesitant to
release his tax returns because this
[ __ ] was making fifteen million
dollars a year sitting on his Mormon ass
while his money makes money in the
market and and he was paying a fifteen
percent tax rate because that was the
capital gains rate so Mitt Romney's
paying fifteen percent on fifteen
million dollars may
and then you have a construction worker
who makes maybe 80 grand and they're
paying like 25% so working people
effectively end up paying more than rich
people in many instances so when he
frames it as well you do know that the
rich pay more than the middle class
right that's actually very misleading
because what he's saying is the the tax
rate cuz we have a progressive tax
system in the US the nominal rate on
paper the income tax rate is already
more for the rich than it is for the
middle class or for the poor what he
doesn't tell you is a lot of the rich
are only paying the capital gains tax
they're not paying the income tax so
they are paying less in taxes as a
percentage so that's incredibly
misleading also they have armies of
attorneys to try to find ways to get
loopholes where even if they're paying
the income tax they find so many ways to
deduct so much money that they end up
paying less their percentage their tax
rate is less this is why Warren Buffett
years ago issued a challenge and he said
any CEO that pays a higher tax rate
higher percentage tax rate than their
secretaries I'll give you it was either
a million dollars or a hundred thousand
I think was a million dollars of my own
money and none of the CEOs were able to
collect because none of them did all of
them paid a lower percentage than their
secretaries and their secretaries were
making like 80 grand and they were
making millions so that's misleading now
again listen this is know I'm not making
excuses for Cory Bush because the
reality is she did answer that question
poorly she did fumble around but I do
think that she's right on the overall
point it's just she didn't back it up
properly and she didn't have the answers
ready to go now me on the other hand I
wanted to give all of this context and
say all of this stuff about how
misleading that is but you can't like
you can't squeeze that in in the Fox
News clip the segment six minutes long
I'm supposed to talk at best for two
minutes and 30 seconds you can only get
so much out so what did I do I decided
okay let me burst everybody's bubble and
go over the top here and say yeah Jeff
Bezos has over a hundred billion dollars
we have 60,000 homeless vets 400,000
homeless Americans we could use a little
redistribution I should have also
mentioned that half of workers in
America make $30,000 a year or less and
you're concerned about playing the old
pitty the oppressed rich game which is
stupid and
but see that's the thing the way they
presented it was actually it was clever
and it was brilliant and it was genius
now of course it's massively misleading
but what made it so clever and so genius
is that they're gonna play the worst
example of somebody arguing for hey
maybe we should raise taxes on the rich
and then they want me to respond and
they put me in a position where no
matter what I say if I agree with what's
being said there I end up looking silly
because then the reaction from the Fox
News viewers gonna be look at this dumb
liberal he won't even admit that she
didn't look good answering that question
when the reality is no that's not what
I'm saying I figured that was so [ __ ]
obvious I didn't even need to bring it
up number one and number two since she's
right on the overarching point I'm gonna
buttress that overarching point okay so
that's the first thing then let's go to
the the portion that I think people are
most are giving me most credit for which
is when he tries to slightly get away
with and I'm talking about the radio
host now not the not the TV host Leland
but he tries to get away with saying all
these Democrats are crazy by the way I
like his fake announcer voice it's so
silly these Democrats are you know
they're all you need to do is let them
speak okay let us speak world [ __ ]
beat you that's what you really want he
goes all they want to abolish ice
abolish law enforcement now I called him
out I said you just made that up nobody
said that you said that nobody said that
nobody argued abolish law enforcement
and then what does he do classic moving
in the goal posts he's like oh yeah
what's ice hey [ __ ] you said they
want to abolish ice comma abolish law
enforcement so you already said abolish
ice now I didn't object to the abolish
ice part because that's true what I did
object to is the abolish law enforcement
part because that implies it's beyond
just ice and it's not beyond just ice so
they try it's like it's these little
things that they'll get away with when
they're in their own bubble because the
so here I am ready to do the show kind
of excited for today's show because we
had a bunch of great stories to cover
have a bunch of great stories to cover I
don't know why I'm talking in the past
tense and a vital laptop for the show
that has all the clips that are gonna be
needed for today's show
crapped out so this has happened before
no big deal obviously had to go to get
it fixed you know I try to put a rush on
it let the person know hey I'll pay
extra if we if we get this done today
long story short looks like we are gonna
get it done today so the show will be
happening later today yes I do look like
a cop right now Jimmy Dore would be very
very saddened by my attire at the moment
with my cop glasses so we are gonna do
the show later today should be a great
show but obviously this was a pain in
the ass and this was unexpected the
first segment I was gonna do was the
breakdown of my Fox appearance that's
still gonna be the first segment I do in
the show I have a lot to say about my
Fox appearance personally I had a lot
more fun this time around than I did
last time around but there are moments
in the Fox interview that I need to
address in detail because you know
you're so limited in the format when
you're on Fox that it doesn't really
give you the leeway to say everything
you want to say so you know specifically
the quarry Bush interview is the thing I
want to pontificate more about we'll do
that but figured I'd shoot a little
video now people in the amount of red
white and people makes me are gonna look
at me like I'm [ __ ] crazy talking to
myself let's try to make it look a
little less awkward here move the camera
down well one thing I wanted to talk
about this wasn't scheduled for today's
show
but I just saw it this morning and I
figured I'll do a separate
video on this right now is that I think
it was Apple iTunes they decided to pull
Alex Jones Show and then Facebook
decided to pull some of Alex Jones shows
and then I think Spotify didn't pull his
entire show but they pulled certain
episodes and there's a little bit of
contradictory information on that I've
seen like a few different headlines some
of them saying that Alex Jones entire
show was pulled from Apple some of them
saying that it was only some of them
again I think Spotify only pulled some
of his shows but I'm a little
disheartened by the reaction to this I
see a lot of you know not-so-subtle
celebrations over this fact and I don't
think it's something to celebrate
now listen put put my record up against
anybody else's record when it comes to
calling out Alex Jones [ __ ] I mean I
honestly think I'm number one in that
category
I am the Tiger Woods I'm the Michael
Jordan of calling out Alex Jones
[ __ ] I make a habit of doing it I do
it at least once a week and again that's
bare minimum
so I'm second to nobody in fact checking
that [ __ ] and I'm second and
nobody in calling him out when he's
spewing his conspiracy theories and you
know peddling to the far right so
pretty much as anti Alex Jones as
humanly possible but having said that
this is a matter of principle
now I get it it's not that you know this
is a literal First Amendment issue
because Alex Jones Alex Jones is not
having a speech suppressed by the
government so this isn't a literal First
Amendment issue however this is the
principle of the First Amendment even
though it's even though these are
private corporations and they get to
determine who does and doesn't come on
their website I think that this is the
principle of the First Amendment is at
play here and this is a terrible
precedent so if you pull Alex Jones down
and they give specific reasons okay it's
not because he does fake news fake news
is technically permissible but this is
what they say they say oh it's because
of specific segments you know doing hate
speech and you know there was a segment
recently where he threatened robert
muller and did this weird simulating
shooting him online now is that
incitement maybe I mean it's borderline
don't get me wrong there are definitely
segments he's done we called out
doofus b-team boy harrison when he did
that segment and he was calling
alexandria Ocasio cortez and bernie
sanders parasites and talking about how
they're leeches and they need to be
eradicated so don't get me wrong there's
been a bunch of stuff that's like
borderline incitement but in my mind you
need to basically say anything goes
except the clear cases of it now I'm not
saying Alex Jones isn't an odious force
in this world in fact I think he is
which is why I call him out all the time
but to
to take down his show from these
prominent outlets I mean that is a
terrible precedent because what now what
now
Oh Alex Jones he's a fringe conspiracy
theorist we really got to pull down his
show okay well what about you know hey
Kyle kolinsky and jimmy dore i mean
these guys they they've really been
pushing back against russia gate and it
sure looks like seventeen intelligence
agencies as the talking point goes which
is [ __ ] because that includes like
the coast guard and they did the old
dick cheney trick of go to anybody at
that agency and get them to tell you
what you want to hear and then say the
entire agency said so you know i push
back on russia gate jimmy door pushes
back on russia gate you know you think
that somebody with my position on the
DNC email hacks how it was good that we
saw it no matter who the source was even
if russia was the one that released the
DNC emails okay we still learned about
primary rigging who in their right mind
can say I'm against knowing that the
primary was rigged and that there was
corruption at the highest levels of the
DNC because of the source of that
information partisan hacks say that but
guess what that's the mainstream media
position in this country that's the
mainstream media position so people look
at me and they think oh well he's the
conspiracy theorist he's the crazy one
and to give that take on things is not
OK you know look at it look at it in
Syria with the fact that we are
literally arming jihadists now it can be
indirectly or it could be directly I
really don't know frankly I really don't
care all that I want to point out is the
objective fact that indeed we are arming
jihadists I mean we just covered the
story from the independent the other day
they found us serial numbers on the
weapons the stockpiles of weapons that
Isis had now people are gonna look at me
talking about these things that are
objectively true and they're gonna say
you're conspiracy theorists you're on
the fringes it's not okay that you say
that hey maybe we should look at pulling
down him
because it always happens oh you start
by going after the guy on the right and
then they're gonna say well look we need
to be equal we need to be neutral we
need to show that we're equally against
fake news on both sides fake news on
both sides so I don't know you know Alex
Jones kind of a conspiracy theorist okay
to pull him down well you know Jimmy
Dore kind of a conspiracy theorist we
think he is - we'll pull him down Kyle
kolinsky I don't know kind of a
conspiracy theorist pull him down - so
once you set the precedent basically
what's happening now is people are
begging
Oleg arks from Silicon Valley to be the
ultimate arbiters of what is real news
and what is fake news and you don't want
that to happen because they're never
gonna do it in a fair way they're never
gonna do it in a in an objective way
they're gonna do it in a way that
coddles people who are in power who are
begging them to take these actions and
what do you know the people who most
want to censor and D platform and
regulate free speech online it happens
to be the establishment so this is a
terrible idea and in fact another story
that we're going to cover in the show
later today is 75% of cases where
there's a crackdown on free speech on
college campuses 75% are actually
against the left so that's not the way
the narrative is covered the narrative
is framed as if oh it's only the right
wingers and it's mildly innopolis and
it's been Shapiro and you know these
guys are the ones who are being censored
and D platformed know when you go to the
data yes let me be clear they actually
are being censored sometimes in D
platform and I'm against that I think
they should be allowed to speak but 75%
of the cases it's people with left-wing
views who are censored or D platformed
and it just doesn't get covered and a
lot of that by the way is pro-palestine
activism they you get censored and D
platform if you're in favor of BDS for
example so listen man it's just a bad
road to go down you don't want to go
down the road of let's have very
powerful Silicon Valley oligarchs
regulate and filter and censor the
content that we want to see and again I
don't even know like why are people
afraid of Alex Jones like he's he's
probably the easiest person on the
internet to debunk and I'm not just
saying that it's so easy to take one of
his claims and just hold up against the
facts and then laugh at him and mock him
and take him down using words you want
to talk about a you know a free exchange
of ideas well here you go there's that's
a free exchange of ideas let me show you
what Alex Jones that says and then let
me explain to you how he's factually
wrong so I don't know there's nothing to
be afraid of there's nothing to be
afraid of sure some people who watch him
are gonna you know they're on the
they're on the fringes and who knows
what the [ __ ] bill do and maybe he
planned some bad seeds in their mind but
same thing with [ __ ] Fox News
honestly same thing with MSNBC we throw
Reilly [ __ ] on they're talking about
Jorge kill tiller the baby killer and
then you know eventually somebody went
and shot george tiller so should that
have been like okay now foxnews needs to
be censored and pulled off the air I
mean I just I don't understand this
logic I mean let's not kid ourselves not
like MSNBC isn't doing anti Donald Trump
stuff 24/7 so somebody does and takes
action and tries to harm President Trump
should MSNBC be censored Indy platform I
mean it just there's no logic it's
people with power taking independent
outlets whether you agree or disagree
with them or think they're spewing fake
news and liars or aren't but as people
with power wielding that power is a
wielding or yielding whatever the [ __ ]
the word is taking that power and using
it to crush
people without power people who are
independent outlets and independent
voices and again this is not a defensive
Alex Jones I don't agree with Alex Jones
I would hold my record up against
anybody's in terms of going after him
and you know holding him accountable
calling out his [ __ ] fact-checking
him I've converted more people away from
Alex Jones than any of these [ __ ]
calling him to be censored ever will and
now you've just given him this outsider
edge who he must be saying something
true because they just cracked down on
him no wrong that's not correct but now
they've given everybody that
misimpression and that's a goddamn shame
so I just I think this is terrible I
think this is terrible I really do and
now the door is open and there will be
censorship the right wing is gonna cry
and scream and [ __ ] and moan leggo it
is only right-wingers who you know get
cracked down on really talk to me talk
to David Pakman who got hit worse by ad
pocalypse it was me and David Pakman so
and Jimmy Doris well actually
so the idea oh the crackdown only
affects the right no it doesn't that's
not true
so you could take your victim narrative
and shove it up your ass this is bigger
than a partisan issue this is a
principal issue this is look my solution
honestly and some people might disagree
with this but my solution is we really
should take Twitter Facebook all these
social media platforms they should be
regulated as public utilities so back in
the day there was the public square and
you know people could talk in a public
square you couldn't censor somebody in
the public square because it's the
public square what's gonna happen the
government's gonna come and drag you out
of there no you can't do that you can't
send your somebody in public square that
would be an actual violation of the
First Amendment in free speech
well now the world is digital and
technological so the public square is
Twitter is Facebook
so and are all these social media
platforms so I think it should be
regulated as a public utility I think
you should leave Alex Jones show up and
I think CNN and MSNBC and any outlet you
want to point out I think every single
one of these outlets should dedicate
time and energy into taking specific
claims of Alex Jones and debunking them
that's a coil here here's what he said
here are the facts here's what he said
here are the facts
here's what he said here are the facts
and then guess what you will have
succeeded in making people de convert
from Alex Jones cult it's not that
difficult it's not that difficult but
when you try to cut corners and you go
about it in a genuinely authoritarian
way where you try to get him pulled off
of various platforms you somehow come
away looking even shittier than he does
which is amazing because I thought that
would be impossible but apparently it's
not so anyway that's enough for my
driving rant like I said I think there
will be a show later today if everything
goes swimmingly and if what I was told
is correct by the people who are gonna
fix the vital laptop so anyway
I'll talk to you guys soon love you and
hang tight stay tuned
hopefully shows come in later today
professor stephen cohen went on CNN to
discuss russia gate he was up against
Anderson Cooper and the neocon max boot
let's see how that went
professor emerges of Russian studies and
politics at nyu and princeton max let's
start with you i mean the president
saying he had a great meeting with
Vladimir Putin the fact is it's been two
weeks now we still don't know what went
on behind closed doors between these two
that's exactly right Anderson and Trump
is aggrieved that he's not getting the
credit that he thinks he deserves but we
have no idea what the heck happened and
if you listen to Mike Pompeo s testimony
last week even Secretary of Pompeo
doesn't have a clear idea of what
happened this is not normal this is not
what normally happens when two leaders
meet you're seeing Trump continuing to
praise Putin and we don't know the
substance of what they discussed
that's a scary scenario Stephen I mean
do you think it's problematic though
that we don't know what was said in that
two plus hour meeting between these two
world leaders and and you know as Mac
said it didn't seem like Mike Pompeo or
other maybe even have a firm grasp on
what was said I don't think it's unusual
we do have a pretty good sense of what
was discussed both from what Trump's
people have said but equally from two or
three speeches Putin has given let me
just rattle them off because I was
looking at him today
they discussed trying to avoid a new
nuclear arms race by keeping alive two
treaties that exist they talked about
peace in Syria including securing
Israeli borders from Iranian forces that
would be very important to Americans I
think they talked about the possibility
of a joint alliance against terrorists
who are in pursuit of weapons of mass
destruction they talked about doing more
business which doesn't make much sense
because of the sanctions and they talked
in some way about the United States
becoming more involved in the Minsk
agreement which is the only agreement we
have to resolve the Ukrainian crisis but
how do you know that's when they
actually talk about those are good
things you have to take food well this
is what they talk the Russian side has
said right
so do you you're going on the
the thought there you're believing
Vladimir Putin on this the one well I
don't want to shock you but I believe in
letting their Putin on several things
but the point is is this has been
confirmed by a number of trumps people
Trump himself made some statements we
discussed this it hasn't really been
confirmed I mean what he doesn't talk
like a normal diplomat what President
Trump actually said to Vladimir Putin is
only known to Vladimir Putin and to
President Trump even if Putin comes
forward and says oh I said this or even
if the president Trump comes forward and
says well I said this we don't know for
sure the only thing we know for sure is
what happened in that press conference
did what happened that press conference
concern Udall Stephen well let me let me
give you an example but I being older
than both of you maybe you don't
remember in early 1986 President Ronald
Reagan met alone within Soviet leader
Gorbachev for I think about two and a
half hours and everybody was a very
upset about it because Reagan was
getting old in the year oh during years
and people were worried when the guys
came out Reagan and Gorbachev they said
we've decided to abolish nuclear weapons
and aides on both sides said you can't
do that just like that so they backed
off but what happened one year later
Reagan and Gorbachev abolished a whole
category of nuclear weapons the
intermediate-range so good things got
done you know nobody else knew except
the two translators what was said in
there
okay so there's president president from
today talked about meeting with the
Iranian president rouhani with with no
preconditions does that surprise you
would that be was it's not surprising to
me at all
Anderson I in fact I predicted it a week
ago when Trump came out with that semi
deranged tweet and all capital letters
threatening it consequences the likes of
which you've never seen before to Iran
based on his pattern you can pretty
easily predict that after threatening
these horrible consequences Trump will
then try to set up a meeting
glad had and you know before long he'll
probably be praising rouhani for being
incredibly intelligent smart witty warm
and reaching a deal that has no
substance to it whatsoever that's his
pattern the striking thing to me is that
although he's willing to threaten North
Korea he's willing to threaten Iran he
never threatens Russia and that's why a
lot of intelligence officials think that
there is something highly suspect in the
relationship between Putin and Trump I
have no idea what mr. booth is talking
about he wants Trump to threaten Russia
why would we threaten Russia you've got
two nucleons they're attacking us and
Russia is attacking us right now
according the trunk no one felt like
Russia
I've been studying Russia for 45 years
I've lived in Russia and I lived here
and you but surely wasn't Russia hasn't
it right
it's excuse me what did you say to me I
said you've been consistent apologist
for Russia in those last 45 years all
right
I don't do defamation to people I do
serious analysis of serious national
security problems when people like you
call people like me and not only me but
people more eminently
apologists for Russia because we don't
agree with your analysis you are
criminalizing diplomacy in daytime and
you are the threat to American national
security in this story why do you have
to defame somebody you don't agree with
it they used to do that in the old
Soviet Union we don't do that here where
we used to but we need to stop it so
you're just finally Steven you're saying
Russia was not attacking the United
States I know what you're talking about
that and during the 2016 election Russia
attacked the United States yes I don't
think they attacked the United okay and
yet you're just an art being apologies
to Russia you're analogizing for
reflection as we speak well you haven't
let me finish you don't know what I'm
gonna say please please nothing began
mr. Cooper and the meddling began right
after the Russian Revolution when
Woodrow Wilson sent American troops to
fight the Russian Civil War please the
meddling began on the Soviet and Russian
let me finish on the Midland side when
the Communists formed the Communist
international
1919 ever since then Moscow's meddled in
our politics
we have meddled in theirs this is
low-level stuff what went on it is not
an attack
it is not nine of
it is not Pearl Harbor it is not Russian
paratroopers descending on washing this
kind of hyperbole an attack on America
suggests we need to attack Russia so
you've got mr. boot saying that Trump
should threaten Russia with what does he
want to attack but that's the thing max
he's already increased sanctions and
it's never enough you always want more
sanctions and listen I do not agree with
Professor Steven Cohen on everything in
fact IV manely disagreed with him on
some things that I've seen him say we
don't need to go into too many specifics
about that because that's immaterial to
the broader conversation here
point is is I'm not co-signing
everything he says or everything he
believes but in this back and forth yeah
he's correct and max boot is wrong the
fact that it's controversial when he
points out what happened in the 2016
election is not akin to Pearl Harbor
what happened in the 2016 election is
not akin to 9/11 the fact that he has to
point that out and that's considered
controversial is insanity and it shows
you how far the Russia hysteria has gone
now listen as I've pointed out before
let's say in this hypothetical world I'm
a senator senator kolinsky proposes
today a bill that number one increases
cyber security and number two moves to
paper ballots to ensure our elections
don't get meddled with that's what I do
so again here's what I find absolutely
mind-blowing all of the people who
scream the most about Russia and about
meddling in our elections and all these
problems there are also the people who
talk the least about potential policy
solutions to fix that problem
it's almost like they don't view it as a
real problem that they really want to
solve they're using it as a political
football they're using it to try to
score brownie points with the electorate
and make it look like they're resisting
Trump without actually resisting now
furthermore max boot is a neo-cons
neocon and what really makes me sad is
that most people who would watch this
back and forth between stephen cohen and
max boot
if they're on the Democratic side I
think at this point most of them would
agree with max boot and not with Stephen
Cohen in other words the guy who's
arguing for date on the guy who wants
peace and negotiations between the US
and Russia that now is the guy who
people on the right would be more
sympathetic to and people allegedly on
the Left Democratic apologists would
look at max boot and say yeah that's my
guy when again max boot is a neo-cons
neocon he's an Iraq war apologist so
look at even the framing of the
questions there and this speaks to how
shitty Anderson Cooper has gotten he
says what went on behind closed doors
what went on behind closed doors
in other words Putin and Trump had a
meeting and they spoke behind closed
doors for a certain period of time
what Anderson Cooper's doing is he's
trying to make assumptions he's trying
to insinuate like oh they're probably up
to some sort of foul play aren't they I
mean obviously Trump is Putin's puppet
this is all the implication this is the
this is the undertone of the
conversation ooh I mean where is all
this talk about Trump being Putin's
puppet so he's in a closed-door meeting
with him for two hours what do you think
went on in that meeting isn't it weird
that we're not learning every little
thing that went on than that meeting and
then Stephen Cohen says well actually
here's the what we've heard so far may
have gone on in that meeting does a
discussion about trying to avoid avoid
an arms race talks about Syria talks
about trade between the countries talk
about Ukraine so he brings up hey here
the things that were discussed behind
closed doors and then they go did you
just take Putin's word for that he's
like well yeah that's we that's what he
says happened in the meeting believe it
or not but that's what he said happened
in the meeting and by the way that seems
perfectly reasonable two presidents of
two countries meet and they discuss the
policy issues relevant to those
countries seems like it's exactly what
would happen like what do you think they
get behind closed doors and flat and
Vladimir Putin's like is our plan and
place Donald and Donald like yes you can
have Alaska like know what's
unbelievable like that the whole thing
is innuendo that's everything on max
boot side and Anderson Cooper's
it's just innuendo and then I like when
he says Stephen Cohen did that press
conference concern you here we go again
when the internet melted down over a
press conference and then and this is
how you know they've lost the plot they
start talking about Iran and cuz Trump
earlier in that day mentioned I'll me
meet with Iran without preconditions now
I have my criticisms of Trump on that
front but my criticism of Trump is that
he pulled out of the Iran deal in the
first place you shouldn't have pulled
out of the Iran deal in the first place
because now what you're doing is you're
creating a problem and then you're
stepping in and saying I will solve the
problem I just created by doing probably
what would be almost an exact same deal
as the Iran deal but the problem is not
that he wants to meet with Iran without
preconditions the problem is that he
blew up the [ __ ] Iran deal in the
first place but look at how Anderson
Cooper frames that is it a bad thing
that he says he meet with Iran without
preconditions and what does max boot -
knocks it right out of that neocon Park
he says well I mean look you can predict
from his behavior of course is what's
gonna happen he's verbally attacked
North Korea on Twitter before and then
he spoke to them and in other words he's
like uh it's gonna be if Trump does some
sort of a deal with Ronnie and he starts
praising Ronnie's being a strong leader
that's what's probably coming next and
he phrasing frames this as if it's like
a bad thing as if like the talking to
the other countries is a bad thing that
may be making a deal with other
countries is a bad thing now if you
think I'm reading too far into it you're
wrong because max boot is a [ __ ]
neo-cons neocon and all he wants is
military invasions everywhere I didn't
make him have his neocon record he has
his neocon record so that to me that
seems pretty [ __ ] important that the
guy who's in favor of invasions
everywhere is on CNN and Anderson Cooper
is throwing softballs at him and he's
like yeah isn't it meeting without
preconditions what a terrible idea
that's the shitty argument that the
Republicans used to use against Obama
don't use that argument the meeting is
not a bad thing the bad thing was
pulling out of the Iran deal in the
first place by the way what was max
boots position on the Iran deal
and then Stephen Cohen is right because
max boot lets the cat out of the bag
there for a second
you know Donald Trump he threatens North
Korea and he threatens Iran
he never threatens Russia you jackass
the way that that criticism is supposed
to go is as follows hey lunatic stop
threatening Iran and stop threatening
North Korea why are you threatening them
stop it that's crazy that's crazier
threatening war on Twitter you [ __ ]
douchebag that's how that criticism goes
the criticism is not he threatens Iran
in North Korea
he never threatens Russia no that's a
dumbest criticism I've ever heard
because your implication is you should
really threaten Russia this is exactly
the [ __ ] I've been worrying about from
day one and I've taken countless [ __ ]
for it online but I've said the main
problem is Democrats resisting without
resisting because they just make mouth
noises about Trump and Russia but they
actually go along with Trump's policies
that's one problem an even bigger
problem is that whenever they actually
tie it into policy they end up resisting
from the right people I know and respect
have done this and they don't even
realize they're doing it and it's
[ __ ] mind-blowing
he never even threatens Russia do you
not realize what your implication is do
you not realize that your implication is
he should threaten this other [ __ ]
nuclear power again you want to
criticize this this is how you criticize
it
Donald Trump is a maniac he's an
authoritarian lunatic he should not be
threatening Iran or North Korea that's
how you make that criticism the
criticism is not he threatens Iran in
North Korea why doesn't he threaten
Russia because then your implication is
he should threaten Russia its own I have
to point out these things it's so crazy
to me that I have to point out these
things and I guarantee you there will be
people and including in this comment
section who are like Kyle doesn't get it
he's an idiot
[Music]
listen don't take my word for it take
Noam Chomsky's word for it there's been
two videos recently released online Noam
Chomsky on Russia Gate one of them we
covered here he was on Democracy Now
another was on a different show you
could check it out he breaks it down in
a better way than I ever could okay he
says first of all if you care about
meddling in elections and that's your
main concern Russia is not even the
worst offender Israel would be the worst
offender Saudi Arabia is a worst
offender than Russia is so the fact that
you care about meddling a lot in
elections but you go to like not even
the strongest case of meddling shows you
don't really care that much about
meddling it's not about that it's about
using this issue for political brownie
points that's what it's about and then
of course there's the angle of we metal
way worse and the same people who scream
like crazy about meddling in our
elections either don't talk about or
actively support us meddling in other
elections that's another giant problem
and then again to me the most important
point is even let's I'm gonna be super
kind to the people who are on the other
side here for a second if you are taking
that position I implore you I urge you
make it crystal clear here are my
solutions to this problem and of course
again the solutions would be a massive
cybersecurity bill and paper ballots to
protect the integrity of our elections I
mean again if you're really concerned
about it fine I don't agree with you but
fine but I do agree on those policies
and you should be pushing for them more
than anybody if this is an issue you're
really concerned about but again they
don't talk about the issues to fix it
which proves my point that perhaps it's
not really about the issue here it's
about using this for political brownie
points and unfortunately this has done
nothing but embolden the intelligence
agencies that are not the friend of the
left and embolden neo-cons and
rehabilitated them at a time when they
should be in [ __ ] prison for what
they did in Iraq
so noam chomsky went on Democracy Now
and he weighed in on Russia gate this is
awesome let's watch there's a focus on
what but I believe our marginalia so it
takes a the huge issue of the
interference and our pristine elections
did the Russians interfere in our
elections an issue of overwhelming
concern that the media I mean in most of
the world that's almost a joke first of
all if you're interested in foreign
interference in our elections
whatever the Russians may have done
barely counts ways in the balance as
compared with what another state does
openly brazenly and with enormous
support Israeli intervention in us enter
elections vastly overwhelms anything the
Russians may have done I mean the even
to the point where the Prime Minister of
Israel Netanyahu goes directly to
Congress without even informing the
president that speaks to Congress with
overwhelming applause to try to
undermine the president's policies what
happened with Obama and Netanyahu in
2015 that Putin come to give an address
to the joint sessions of Congress trying
to calling on them to reverse US policy
without even informing the president and
that's just a tiny bit of this
overwhelming influence so if you happen
to be interested in influence of foreign
influence and elections there are places
to look but that even that is a joke I
mean one of the most elementary
principles of functioning democracy is
that elected representatives should be
responsive to those who elected them
there's nothing more elementary than the
now we we know very well that that is
simply not the case in the United States
there's ample literature and mainstream
academic political science simply
comparing voters attitudes with policies
pursued by their representatives and it
shows that for a large majority of the
population that basically
disenfranchised their own
representatives pay no attention to
their voices they listen to the voices
of the famous 1% the rich and the
powerful of the corporate sector the
elections Tom Ferguson's stellar work
has demonstrated very conclusively that
for a long period way back u.s.
elections have been pretty much bought
you can predict the outcome of a
presidential or congressional election
with remarkable precision that simply be
looking at campaign spending that's only
one part of it lobbyists practically
write legislation and congressional
offices in massive ways the concentrated
private capital corporate sector super
wealth intervene in our elections
massively overwhelmingly to the extent
that the most elementary principles of
democracy are undermined now of course
all that is technically legal but that
tells you something about the way the
society functions so if you want if
you're in terrific concerned with our
elections and how they operate and how
they relate to what would happen in
democratic society taking a look at
Russian hacking is absolutely the wrong
place to look well you see occasionally
some attention to these matters in the
media but very minor
as compared with the extremely marginal
question of Russian hockey and I think
we find this on issue after issue also
on issues on which what Trump says for
whatever reason is not unreasonable
so he's perfectly right when he says we
should have better relations with Russia
being dragged through the mud for that
is outlandish makes Russia shouldn't
refuse to deal with the United States
because the u.s. carried out the worst
crime of the century and the invasion of
Iraq that much worse than anything
Russia's done but they shouldn't refuse
to deal with us for that reason and we
shouldn't refused to deal with them for
whatever infractions they may have
carried out which certainly exists this
is just observed we have to move towards
better there are a right at the Russian
border there are very extreme tensions
that could blow up any time and lead to
what would in fact be a terminal nuclear
war terminal for the species and life on
Earth we're very close to that and we
could ask why first of all we should do
things to ameliorate it secondly we
should ask why well suppose NATO
expanded after the collapse of the
Soviet Union in violation of the verbal
promises to me fall Gorbachev mostly
under Clinton partly under both first
Bush then Clinton expanded right to the
Russian border you know for the past few
weeks actually probably more than that
but definitely more so in the past few
weeks I've been looking at the national
conversation i've been looking at the
meltdown that everybody seemed to be
having on twitter over that press
conference with Putin and Trump and it
really felt to me like there was some
sort of collective psychosis going on
almost like all of political Twitter was
having a psychological breakdown in
real-time and you know we were
watching it happen and it was really
strange to me because even people that I
I respect I was watching them go down
this rabbit hole of what I think is
genuine conspiracy theory and it's tough
because you feel after a while you you
know just just by asking for evidence
and not swallowing the mainstream media
narrative whole you you feel
marginalized and you feel lonely and
you're like damn am I the one that's
lost my mind or is it that I'm looking
at how everybody's reacting and I really
think they're unhinged which is it am I
the one with the problem here because
again all I feel like is I'm asking for
a coherent explanation of Russia gate
from the biggest proponents of it and
I've just never been convinced by their
explanations and I I don't see the
evidence now again this isn't me saying
like I'm against Muller's investigation
completely I'm not in fact I look at
what happened with mana for I look at
what happened with Flynn and I think a
Muller did a good job and I think the
money laundering and you know Flynn
representing the Turkish government
without registering as a foreign
lobbyist I think those are those are
totally real stories real crimes and I
support mullah going after them so I'm
not saying Trump isn't involved in
corruption I'm not saying that there
aren't aspects of his administration
factions of his administration that are
doing the bidding of foreign governments
I just have never been convinced of it
on the issue of Russia and when
everybody else seems so convinced I'm
like I don't know how they're that
convinced number one but number two I
don't know how this has become so
goddamn pervasive that it's like I'm one
of like three or four voices that's
going yep still not convinced but now
Noam Chomsky comes along he he talks
about this on Democracy Now and it's
almost like he just reminded me that I'm
not crazy and I watched this I was like
oh okay good thank God so somebody else
who I really respect and look up up to
and he was big influence on me even
getting started in doing what I do
and he soberly analyze it I go oh okay
good
thank you because that's similar to my
breakdown so first he says okay so the
issue is interference in elections
that's the issue that's the thing that
everybody's like Oh Russia's interfering
are let's stop he goes even if you
accept that as this is something that's
like really important that we should all
be focusing on ad nauseam now even if
you do accept that I think it's still
fair to say there's been way too much
coverage to this compared to other
issues like the fact that we're
participating in a genocide and Yemen
gets no coverage but putting that aside
for a second except that this is okay
this should be covered extensively and
it's really important well Chomsky
points out the interference from Israel
is worse and happens more than the
interference from Russia so again even
if you accept that premise that we
should really all go nuts of
interference in our elections even
though we interfere and everybody else's
elections and it's a given that they're
gonna try to interfere in our elections
and this should just par for the course
in international politics but even
putting that aside again being as kind
as we can to the opposing point of view
Chomsky points out but the interference
from Israel is just way worse so I know
that when you say this stuff people
accuse you of what about ISM but here's
the thing man how can you not account
for interference from other countries
especially if that interference is
orders of magnitude worse and that's
what he's pointing out so we discussed
it before but when President Trump was
president elect Trump Israel contacted
his administration and told them hey
you're gonna go to the UN and you're
gonna try to block this resolution that
condemns our illegal settlements and
they tried and you know remember Jared
Kushner got 30 million dollars from
Israeli banks so they're taking money
and they're doing the bidding of this
government and they're directly
affecting policy and this again was when
was President Elect not even president
yet and then
you know you look at what happened with
the Jerusalem embassy move is there some
monetary exchange there I just told you
a Jared Kushner took thirty million
dollars from Israeli banks I'm sure
there's other people in the
administration also taking that money so
and then they do a policy that no other
administration would do but the Trump
administration did that's a very
provocative policy that's exactly what
the far right of Israel wants and that
also ruins any potential for a two-state
peace deal down the road could be some
massive massive corruption there
Saudi Arabia is another great example
Saudi officials give Trump three hundred
thousand dollars when they stay at his
hotel for a few nights why are they
paying that much well they're paying
that much because they were buying
access and they were buying policy they
want like the over a hundred billion
dollar weapons deal the Trump approved
for them Trump registered eight new
businesses in Saudi Arabia on the
campaign trail then he gets in power and
gives them whatever the [ __ ] they want
he went from calling them responsible
for 9/11 to giving them over a hundred
billion dollar weapons deal and aiding
in their genocide of Yemen so again if
you interference in our elections
foreign governments controlling our
politics you have even worse offenders
even if you agree that that premise is
absurd we got to cover it all the time
and meltdown
you have worse offenders because the
strongest argument made against Russia
is that they were responsible for
releasing the DNC emails so they release
the DNC emails by the way they didn't
make the DNC rigged the primary against
Bernie Sanders they didn't make Hillary
Clinton and Debbie wasserman-schultz be
insanely corrupt they didn't make Donna
Brazile leak debate questions to Hillary
Clinton you know kourin made a great
point about this he said if the leaks
didn't uncover anything they wouldn't
have affected the election so if the DNC
wasn't rigging the election well then
the DNC email hacks and leaks would have
been useless so you're getting mad at
the people who are telling you about the
rigging as opposed to the rigging itself
that seems [ __ ] crazy to me I made
the comparison recently to Edward
Snowden
now it's not exactly analogous because
Edward Snowden was doing it as a matter
of conscience so he's like this is the
right thing to do to show everybody how
the government spying and taking all
your information and it's a violation of
the Fourth Amendment the Constitution so
Edward Snowden released information that
should have been released out of
conscience Russia did not release the
dnc stuff out of conscience and they
care about what's right no I think they
did do that because they preferred Trump
to Hillary but at the end of the day
either way we should have seen those
emails we should have seen those hacks
because it exposed primary rigging so
I'm more mad at the people who rigged
the primary than the people who told me
that the primary was rigged because I'm
not [ __ ] drinking the kool-aid and
going down this rabbit hole of insane
conspiracy theory and scapegoating so
now by the way does this mean that oh we
shouldn't take any action in response to
what's going on with Russia and their
election interference and all that no no
that's not no I I would lead the charge
if I was a senator I would lead the
charge I would immediately propose a
cybersecurity bill and I would
immediately propose paper ballots why
because that's how you try to protect
against this kind of stuff happening
again okay so let's do that
but you'll notice something guys every
single proponent of Russia gate that
shrieks and yells and screams and goes
nuts and points the finger and
scapegoats all day long and they won't
stop talk about anything but Russia gate
and the attack on our democracy go ahead
you check how many of them talk about
paper ballots all the time how many of
them talk about a cybersecurity bill all
the time they don't even talk about the
[ __ ] solutions so that's how you know
this is all being used for political
gain it's cuz they don't even [ __ ]
talk about the solutions you would think
that if you were really so concerned
about election interference and oh my
god we got to make sure this doesn't
happen again that you would lead with
the policies that would prevent it from
happening again and that would be your
main focus but no they don't talk about
that at all and all they want to do is
harp away on the problem without giving
a solution because they're using it for
political gain so I don't it drives me
crazy that people who are respect have
gone down this rabbit hole and are not
thinking logically
this and then again so final point is
Chomsky brings up concentrated capital
and that means you know big business
multinational corporations billionaires
lobbyists he says if you care about
interferes in our elections that should
be your first concern because just cuz
we've made that legal doesn't mean it's
any less real and any less egregious so
when you have a situation where in
Congress 93% of the time whoever raises
the most money wins well then you
understand why our system so broken
because those people raise money from
big business and corporations and
billionaires and lobbyists and then they
turn around and only do policy that
favors those lobbyists so we have an
oligarchy that's what we have they're
representing the moneyed interests there
was a study from Princeton that came out
a while ago that said indeed we function
as an oligarchy so if you care about
interference in our elections you should
be screaming about Big Pharma and the
military-industrial complex and Goldman
Sachs way more way before you get to
Russia releasing some DNC emails that
prove that they were rigging the
election so it's just the priorities are
all [ __ ] up and I lied I have one more
point the Democrats have now put
themselves in this position
anytime Trump does a reasonable policy
on when it comes to the issue of Russia
they will scream that he did it because
he's Putin's puppet so they will
position themselves as de facto against
any reasonable policy visa V Russia so
do you understand that's a very
important point let's say Donald Trump
says hey man looks like we're on the
brink of war I don't like that I'm gonna
remove the US warships from the Black
Sea that are right on Russia's border
I'm gonna get rid of the NATO troops
that are right on Russia's border
because that's a giant giant escalation
imagine Russia put troops on Mexico's
border with us we'd be like scrambled
we're going to war that's what's
happening right now but we can have NATO
troops right on Russia's border we can
have US warships in the Black Sea right
on their border and if Trump were to
decide I'm going to move those I'm gonna
get rid of those troops I'm gonna
de-escalate we're gonna do peace talks
and negotiations and we're gonna make it
so that we have a functioning
relationship with Russia and we move
away from war the brink of nuclear war
at that immediately every single elected
Democrat in the country would scream
that he's only doing that because he's
Putin's puppet and you need to not do
that so we're gonna have in the 2020
election we are gonna have the most
perverse incentive we've ever seen from
the Democrats on foreign policy where
they're all gonna be competing for who
can be more hawkish and who can escalate
more on the issue of Russia and that's
what I that's what drives me nuts is
that now policy is not even in the
conversation because we're so busy
hurling accusations of treason and
traitor and calling people Putin's
puppets that even if you proposed the
policy that Democrats should favor peace
talks negotiation not escalation not
increase sanctions well then now if you
do those things that's obviously
evidence that you're Putin's puppet so
we're in favor of a permanent standoff
and permanent escalation for rank
political partisan reasons and that
drives me nuts and I've tried to be as
clear as possible about this stuff from
the beginning man where I stand on the
policies themselves and what I can say
is this I support the sanctions over the
Crimea situation so that round of
sanctions I'm totally fine with but
outside of that I would not have US
warships in the Black Sea that's a
disgusting escalation and that that's an
unstable act I would remove the troops
from NATO's border and I would
immediately try to open up a line of
communication and have genuine
negotiations and talks and listen both
sides on this have legitimate bones to
pick I mean obviously Putin's upset
because there was Anna
that the u.s. not moved towards towards
Russia's border anymore with NATO going
back to the collapse of the Soviet Union
and we did exactly that
so they view that as rank aggression
from the West so they have a genuine
issue there with what the West is doing
now the West you know we can genuinely
be upset about how he annexed Crimea and
just took it and said Matt and you know
what he didn't Georgia back in the day
so there are real issues there but this
is why you need to talk this is why you
can't have a toxic political environment
where the Democrats are begging Trump to
be more hawkish and standoffish with
Putin so I told you guys a million times
I'm a policy guy that's what I care
about and so that's why this frustrates
me so much and why I think this is so
damaging is because now even if Trump
were to do the policies that I think are
the most reasonable policies every
elected Democrat in the country would be
against them and say how dare you do
that that's scary that's [ __ ] scary
so noam chomsky enlightening as always
here and you know if you're somebody who
has had serious disagreements with me on
this whole Russia gate thing you know
maybe you'll pause a little bit more and
they'll make you think a little bit more
when the person who's making the
argument it's not me but it's you know
one of the most world-renowned
so here I am minding my own damn
business on a Thursday night because I'm
an angel and I never do anything wrong
and people start tweeting me in Infowars
video it turns out they decided to
strike back
now it wasn't Alex Jones although he'd
be well within his rights to strike back
himself because I go after him probably
once a week but it was a b-level
Infowars host I had done a video
recently going after this guy because he
did a segment where he thought it was
cute and he thought his little of his
word game was clever and he went after
Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio
Cortes by comparing them to ticks and he
said that we need to eradicate the blood
sucking parasites now in the video he's
only referring to ticks but you know he
happens to show a picture of Bernie
Sanders on the screen a picture of
Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and he rants
against socialists and clearly is
comparing them so I went after him
because he deserved it so I'm gonna go
ahead and play this video for you here
well pause as we go along
doing this old-school style low quality
I'm just gonna turn my camera phone here
and you guys can see it and let's break
it down
victim of a vicious leftist socialist
smear and I'm here too we are 13 seconds
in you already have multiple factual
errors you're not a victim what happened
I thought that you guys were against
victim culture on the right that's what
you tell me all the time you say oh my
god is the left wingers they do the
oppression Olympics and they all think
they're victims don't be a victim you
have to change the narrative so now all
of a sudden it's cool and it's in vogue
and it's fashionable when you decide
you're the victim and also I'm not a
socialist so factually wrong
as we watch here you're gonna realize
something he didn't actually watch the
full video of me going after him but
nonetheless he proceeds to strawman me
and attack arguments I didn't make so
pretty much what you'd expect from
Infowars let's continue set the record
straight it all started about a week ago
maybe a little more when I made a
frankly hilarious and insightful video
where I was basically just reading a
story about ticks while I had images pop
up of socialists so of course I was
describing the way that ticks are blood
sucking monsters and that we need to do
everything we can to get rid of them
that they provide nothing and exists
solely to drain life wood from their
hosts all right now if you watch this
and had a fully developed brain you
understood that this was jaw-droppingly
insightful and hilarious however I had I
had a rude awakening when one day I get
on Twitter and I'm being accused of
calling for genocide I'm being told that
people are calling the FBI on me they're
calling me a murderer first of all I
have no clue of what you're saying here
is true did anybody call the FBI on you
I have no idea would you take the word
of a Infowars host without evidence I
certainly wouldn't now if there are
people who call the FBI on you I don't
agree with that if there are people that
accuse you of being a murderer I don't
agree with that either however not sure
I believe you I think you're full of
[ __ ] because your segment it wasn't
funny but that's not me saying it from
like oh my god I'm so offended and so
triggered by your segment perspective
that's me saying it from I looked at
your analysis I looked at the word game
you were playing how you were showing
pictures of politicians and comparing
them to blood sucking ticks and saying
we should quote eradicate them and I
said oh well that's a really shitty
message and if you put the shoe on the
other foot and there's some left winger
and they do a comparable video of that
where they talk about Republicans or
they even talk about the far-right they
talk about tea party
members they talk about fascists they
talk about whatever anarcho-capitalists
and they compared them to parasites and
they say we should probably eradicate
people with this ideology pretty sure
you would respond also and you would be
correct to do so because that rhetoric
is dumb that's why I called you out cuz
it's dumb not only is it dangerous
because there aren't the brightest
people in the world watching in force
it's flat-out dumb let's continue I'm
advocating why'd you say eradicate the
blood sucking ticks why eradicate and
that's not the only thing you said
either in fact I'll leave a link to that
video in the video description box in
the original video so you can see
exactly how terrible his argument is and
exactly how close it is to incitement
now I'm a free speech absolutist so
would I ban your channel give you a
strike over that video no but again
that's because I'm a free speech
absolutist but you can't pretend like
that video is not close to incitement
and oh oh did I say eradicate them and
then show pictures of Bernie Sanders now
Alexandria Ocasio Cortes and say that we
should you know eliminate and eradicate
the Socialists II know you don't get to
play that game [ __ ] you don't get to
play that game if you set it on up to it
and when you get called out respond like
an adult you don't straw a man in a
response like you're about to do right
now or play dumb like me did I make that
argument this is all a vicious smear by
a man named Kyle
kolinsky from secular talk and a little
language warning oh no socialists are
often crude creatures and he begins his
segment with a word that I won't utter
the dude was talking about eradicating
blood sucking ticks who are the people
who don't share his political ideology
but we found something that offends him
it's naughty language it's naughty
language sir you have
reached the quorum don't you know it is
immoral to make weird mean noises with
your mouth that we've determined are
unacceptable words and polite society
all of a sudden you want to you want to
be polite and pretend like you give a
[ __ ] about decorum these guys are so
full of [ __ ] man they're so full of [ __ ]
he's acting he's playing a character
which is why I probably shouldn't even
be wasting my time responding well let's
go to that clip now shall we so one of
the shittier Infowars hos decided it was
a good idea to you know do a casual
nonchalant segment advocating for
genocide this is hyperbole I wish I wish
it was my purply it's not hyperbole take
a look this is Harrison Smith for
infowars.com the topic of our story
today is an unpleasant one its parasites
bugs ticks to be precise the headline is
from Wired we have no idea how bad the
us tick problem is now ticks are are
parasites they provide nothing they
simply find a host a productive host to
leech off of and they suck their
lifeblood their energy and take it to
themselves providing the host with
nothing often leaving the host disease
and that down yeah pull it down as your
own words 100% prove my point
oh is that the picture of Bernie Sanders
on the screen is I'm talking about blood
sucking ticks or leeches and or a waste
of society and we should get rid of them
yeah yeah pull it down pull it down
because it's 100% proving him correct
clearly a joke clearly clearly clearly
I'm sure you you guys were laughing your
ass off as you watch that at least
attempting to be funny and you think at
least he's acknowledging here funding
this guy Kyle from secular talk would be
able to understand this but you have to
remind yourself that this is a guy that
still thinks socialism is a good idea so
they're wrong I don't
agree with that I've stated repeatedly I
believe in social democracy which is
very distinct from socialism and you
would know that if you were in a total
douche weasel and an idiot and
furthermore I don't give a [ __ ] if you
were trying to joke or not I'm
responding to the substance of what you
were saying if there's a comedian and
the comedian is making a joke
where there's an underlying point that
they're trying to get at and I disagree
with that underlying point I might make
a video calling that calling that person
out and saying here's why I disagree
with the point you were making joke or
not because that's what I do I'm a
commentator I break stuff down stuff
that's either interesting or weird or
scary or newsworthy and this certainly
was that you have millions and millions
of subscribers on Infowars and you're
casually talking about how we should
eradicate the blood sucking tics like
Bernie Sanders in Alexandria Ocasio
cortes so let's continue
Bellino telling what sort of nonsense
that this guy believes haha and there
are a couple things I'd like to I'd like
to talk about I'd like to respond to his
vicious and lying defamation lying
defamation these guys are the worst
snowflakes again instead of responding
like an adult and going point by pulling
or saying hey man here's our
disagreement lying defamation
I played almost your entire [ __ ] clip
and responded to it lying defamation
accurately quoting you is lying
defamation snowflakes run to your
[ __ ] safe space man Jesus I was not
calling for genocide I was talking about
ticks oh okay all right to get rid of
socialists by convincing them that
they're dumb okay oh so the thing that
you didn't do in the video is the thing
that you were trying to do in the video
when you talk about eradicating the
blood sucking ticks what you really
meant was through logical argumentation
show them that they're wrong well that's
weird if you were going
go down that road why didn't you through
logical argumentation show them that
they're wrong in your video oh you
didn't do that because that's not the
[ __ ] point of the video the point was
to compare socialist Bernie Sanders
Alexandre Ocasio Cortez who by the way
are not even actual socialists to
parasites to leeches to useless people
in society you need to be eradicated I
love see you pin them down and quote
them with their own [ __ ] words and
then they move the goal posts oh I
didn't say that what I meant to say was
I wanted to show them how dumb they are
which is why in the video I didn't show
them how dumb they are and I compared
them to parasites and did by the way
same tactic now I don't think this guy
is you know a C okay but that is the
same tactic that was used by the Nazis
again I don't think he's a Nazi I think
that would be far too harsh I think he's
just a silly person okay let me be clear
about that
but that's the exact same tactic that
was used by the Nazis go back and read
the history and look at what they said
about Jews they compared them to leeches
to parasites to fleas to you know a
vermin they this is what the literature
shows so forgive me for running a clip
where it's your own words and then
responding to it in a logical way I know
that trigger view that's all I want to
rid the world of socialists and honestly
I could just not do anything because the
pattern of the world is that if you just
leave socialists to their own devices
they all die not true right so pretty
much any country in the world that has
gone over to socialism has become a
hellhole of death and misery I don't
want that I want to see my socialist
brothers and sisters thrive and graduate
to a level of capitalism that will
ensure the continuation of life on earth
that's now know for the record this is
not what he did in that video now he's
saying that this is what he believes
okay well you should have said this then
you didn't say this then if you said
this then I wouldn't have made a [ __ ]
video responding to you so again they
just changed the conversation by the way
this is the oldest trick in the book
they always say Oh
so she named a place it's worked well
first of all none of us are actually
promoting socialism myself alexandria
Ocasio cortez bernie sanders but if you
want us to point to a place where our
philosophy works Scandinavia how many
times have I done this I did this in the
[ __ ] video that you're responding to
but you didn't watch the full thing so
you didn't hear it
so now you're gonna make an ass of
yourself straw Manning me and then
knocking down the straw man I'm coming
from it's a place of love but I did want
to bring up this very interesting story
while we're talking about this this is
from Yale smart guys over there even
four-year-olds dislike freeloaders says
children as young as age for to express
dislike of and are willing to punish
those who freeload off the work of other
group members a new new Yale University
study has found so you see what he's
doing here now he's Oh Kyle you're so
stupid even four-year-olds dislike
freeloaders now obviously your ideology
involves freeloading no it doesn't it's
called the Commons it's called every
single developed society every single
first world civilization on this planet
has some level of government is it
freeloading when we build roads is it
freeloading when we have cops
is it freeloading when we have a the
fire department is it freeloading when
we have a military is it freeloading
when we have public infrastructure are
all these things freeloading is grandma
freeloading when she's on Medicaid or
Medicare is that what's happening is
Social Security freeloading now my
answer all those questions is no because
in a rational society what you do is you
say it's not the question isn't whether
we should or shouldn't have government
the question is how much government
where where's the line how much in taxes
should we pay what services should be
given and a reasonable Society take
certain things and move them to the side
and says these are taken care of you
know health care is a perfect example is
something that should be taken care of
education to a certain extent already is
taken care of not higher education
that's one of the things we're fighting
for is to make it the same as it would
be for
public high school for example for
college so that's not freeloading that's
not freeloading in fact it's almost like
you're begging to be a sucker cuz we
already pay taxes well you want to do is
pay your taxes to the government and
then say ok take my money and go away
like you're appeasing them like they're
the Mafia or something whereas my
philosophy is if I want to pay taxes and
again in every developed society they
pay taxes I want something for that
money
I want education I want health care I
want a new New Deal in an infrastructure
bill I want to change our infrastructure
from a grade of D Plus which is what we
get right now according to the Society
of Civil Engineers and make it an A so
you think you're arguing for a
reasonable position actually you're
arguing for a really dumb position
because you're you're defining basic
government action and the bare minimum
bare necessities you're defining that as
freeloading
which again is stupid because under your
society you pay taxes and then you just
say ok government take my money and go
away whereas I believe when you pay
taxes you should [ __ ] get something
for it but here we go more of the straw
man he thinks that we believe in
freeloading and he thinks that oh you
got me or even four-year-olds dislike
freeloaders so you get a Kyl that means
you're dumber than a four-year-old god
man you work at Alex Jones Infowars you
have an opportunity to be the least
shitty host there wouldn't be that hard
to be the lish least shitty host there
but somehow you are which is surprising
because the questions often been asked
is this a learned ideology is this a
learned
fact that you you should treat others
you should you should work for what
you're given and that others should work
for what they're given well it turns out
that no it's something intrinsic within
us that says that socialism is stupid it
turns out that even four-year-olds with
their underdeveloped frontal lobe with
their extreme lack of experience in the
real world even these
the most unintelligent you could say
among us the youngest the least
developed even they recognized that
socialism does not work and is not good
and should not be allowed to continue so
it's surprising to me that we have so
many people people that if I'm being
honest I've actually watched secular
talk before I have liked some of his
segments the guy's not partisan he's not
afraid to go after Democrats or
Republicans or anybody
I've watched videos of his and liked
them so it was such a surprise to me to
see that that I accurately called out
your bitch-ass video that sucked
terribly shouldn't be a surprise to you
if I'm not afraid to call everybody out
I'm definitely not afraid to call your
ass out and okay you want to play nice
let's play nice there was a time when
Alex Jones used to talk about the
Patriot Act and talk about how terrible
that was he talked about NSA spying talk
about how terrible that was he used to
talk about Wars and talk about how these
are wars of aggression that we shouldn't
be involved in and we should get out of
them now those were the good old days
weren't that when Alex Jones made sense
forty-two percent of the time those days
are long gone now he talks about [ __ ]
demons more than he talks about the
Patriot Act isn't that embarrassing you
work for a guy who thinks demons are
real and he talks about it almost on a
daily basis I know because I've covered
the stories damn man
why did you do this why did you respond
you know you shouldn't have done this
she would not only pretend not to
understand that I was joking present my
video I don't care if you were joking
joking or not I'm responding to the
underlying point dumbass I'm sorry I
forgot I can't curse because this is
something that triggers this guy and
naturally he'll use the fact that I use
a naughty language to dismiss all of the
accurate things I'm saying serious tell
all of his fans this guy at Infowars is
calling for genocide who were he made a
bad joke that could be construed as no
no he said this Infowars host is calling
for genocide cuz you did you want to
eradicate the blood sucking ticks that's
what you want to do you want to
eliminate the leeches that's what you
want to do
me saying it that's what you said it's
in your video as you show pictures of
Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Bernie
Sanders son listen listen I know
Alexandria Ocasio Cortez I know her she
was one of the first justice Democrats
this is somebody I know so when you
casually show pictures of her on the
screen as you talk about eradicating the
blood sucking ticks yeah I'm gonna
respond and it shouldn't just be me
responding that's something that should
be highlighted by more than just me
because there's millions of subscribers
on Alex Jones channel that's where this
was posted and you think that's not
reckless you think that doesn't deserve
a response joke or not again I'm not I'm
not triggered by it I'm not calling for
you know your channel to be taken down
over it but I'm gonna check your ass and
if there's anything that's missing over
so the hosts on the view got into a
debate about Alexandria Ocasio Cortes
and you know more broadly about
democratic socialism and social
democracy and the way that this debate
unfolded absolutely made my day I mean I
was cheesing from ear to ear when I
finished watching this clip so Joy Behar
legitimately looks like she's been
listening to secular talk because she
did exactly what I've been screaming at
people on the left to do when presented
with these talking points from the right
so let's take a look and then I'll break
it down
isn't democratic socialism very close to
liberalism I mean now think about it for
a second medicare social security guards
collection the post office and I asked
her this question about what do you mean
by being a Democratic Socialist and she
went over her platform
she says Medicare for all good fully
funded public schools and universities
love it paid family and sick leaves
justice system reform immigration
justice infrastructure overhaul clean
campaign finance an economy of peace
housing as a human right well I don't
know
by the way I hope Democrats do run a
democratic socialism we win duel because
I think you lose spectacularly and then
I will look forward to election night
when I finally get to tell everybody I
told you so he ends up running a radical
problem with socialism in the words of
Margaret Thatcher at a certain point you
run out of spending other people's money
Venezuela one of richest countries in
the world in the 70s now the average
Venezuelan has lost 24 pounds because
they're starving to death 90 percent I
think country - goodnight I think she's
talking more about Scandinavia than
Venezuela but I'm sorry I need this is
what I need from her name one country
the socialism has ever worked and also
every - every democratic socialist copan
was going on TV saying that it's good
needs to start paying 90% in taxes yes
yes yes yes yes that's it
that's it that's all I've been asking
for people on the left to do from the
beginning here so they read her platform
on air that's [ __ ] awesome that's
exactly what we want and by the way
people on the right are just walking
right into this trap they have no idea
what they're doing there was an article
in The Daily Caller from somebody who
went to an Alexandria Ocasio Cortes
rally and she wrote about how it's easy
to see how you can be seduced by the
idea that your kid deserves health care
and an education I'm not kidding she
wrote that down and a living wage - she
said oh it's easy to see how people who
don't know better can think a living
wage is a good idea
what so she is now Alexandria Ocasio
Cortes broke the brains of the right so
thoroughly that they are now openly
arguing against the idea that if if you
work full-time you should make enough
money to survive see that's the thing is
that with these weak and corrupt
Democrats of yesteryear the Hillary
Clinton wing Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi
all those people they were always just
falling over themselves to agree with
Republicans their Republican light their
corporatists their neo liberals so you
have no
you mean when you I'm like the other guy
except a little bit nicer but I'm like
the other guy that there's that's not
appealing to anybody but if you take a
stand on issues that you believe in and
you know you're right because they're
common-sense issues living wage medicare
for all free college and the wars
legalize marijuana you are then forcing
the right to respond to those things and
when they respond to those things with
the deeply unpopular positions they hold
you win they're arguing against the
living wage do you realize how [ __ ]
crazy that is 80% of the American people
want to raise the minimum wage so now
they read her platform on air thank you
that's all I could ever ask because as
soon as people hear that the reaction
joy behar was giving is the exact
reaction that any reasonable human being
would give okay I like that I like that
one or two I like that one too I like to
have one too listen even if you disagree
with one or two of the things in their
platform you're gonna agree with like
over 90 percent of it even if you're
somebody who thinks you're a
conservative you're gonna go okay that
makes all right that makes sense okay
that one too so that helps so much by
going directly to the issues reading one
by one that thing's on the platform then
they go from you know she says well if
you go by the platform democratic
socialism is pretty close to liberalism
now I know people who are deep political
walks might look at that and go no
that's left is omits not liberalism
there's a distinction we have to talk
about that distinction but listen the
reality is what alexandria Ocasio Cortez
represents what Bernie Sanders
represents with justice Democrats
represent with these populist left
candidates represent it really is what
Democrats should have been all along New
Deal Democrats so yes it's what they
should have been representing all along
so it's what one half of the political
spectrum should have been pushing from
day one and never stop pushing so in
that sense yes it is close to liberalism
because it's what they should have been
doing every step of the way
from the beginning they just abandon
that so that point is actually true like
oh it's isn't this like really just kind
of common sense stuff and exactly what
the left and and liberals should have
been pushing for all along and then
again listen the whole the whole crux of
this debate here it all starts with a
straw man because when
Ocasio Cortez or Bernie sander they say
we're democratic socialists again if you
go by their policy proposals they're
run-of-the-mill Social Democrats so in
other words they're not arguing for the
the social ownership of the means of
production now you might be in favor
that fine that's that's fine but that's
not what they believe what they believe
is explicit and it's social democracy
now they call themselves democratic
socialists ok so I guess that label is
evolving to one extent or another but
let's just be clear about the
distinctions here and by the way DSA
also now has come out and said we
consider ourselves a big ten-four
socialists so if you are in favor of the
social ownership of the means of
production fine you have a home here but
if you are in favor of the scandinavian
model welfare state ism social democracy
you're welcome here as well and that's
what their philosophy happens to be so
when they say democratic socialism and
then they lift lists off the things that
are not post capitalist but just within
a capitalist framework much further to
the left well that that's an accurate
depiction of where Alexandria Castrol
Cortez and Bernie Sanders happen to fall
on the spectrum now I find it hilarious
when Meghan McCain says at a certain
point you run out of other people's
money quoting Margaret Thatcher when
Thatcher argued and socialism Meghan
McCain your dad is worth hundreds of
millions of dollars and your dad is
worth hundreds of millions because
apparently your mom it was a beer
heiress so you're about to get a
tremendous amount of inherited wealth
that you did Dickie mcgee-zax for the
only reason you're even on this show is
because of your last name you pampered
little prick so for you to take it to
argue against uh people shouldn't have
their basic needs met unbelievable they
haven't even worked for it when your
whole life is just a red carpet of
privilege you need to www.engvid.com son
cuz that is unbelievable I mean the lack
of self-awareness is record-breaking
it's unbelievable it's really just
insane okay and then finally Joy Behar
nailed it
listen if you are on the right and
you're
bottle to Alexandria Ocasio Cortez or
Bernie Sanders or the Justice Democrats
or whoever it may be you know people who
are now running if your rebuttal
involves referencing the Soviet Union
Venezuela or Cuba you have no rebuttal
because that's a straw man nobody in
justice Democrats Alexander L Castro
Cortez Bernie Sanders no not fully none
of them have said I believe in a
post-capitalist philosophy
I support the Venezuelan system none of
them said that so why are you bringing
it up you're bringing up because you
don't have an actual response you don't
have a rebuttal so you have to strawman
and then knock down the straw man which
is why Joy Behar
accurately points out and that is well
things cost a lot and things are going
really poorly and that's why this is so
terrible I can't believe she's arguing
for a Venezuelan system and she calmly
says I'm pretty sure she's arguing more
for a Scandinavian type system than for
a Venezuelan type system and megan
mccain cuz she's incapable of listening
because she has a cinderblock for a head
keeps going as if there wasn't a
rebuttal to her point right there it
says what she needs to do is name at
least one country where this philosophy
has worked and then you [ __ ] Joy
Behar nailed you to the wall because
she's like oh how about I give you 46
countries where this philosophy has
worked Norway Denmark Iceland Sweden and
she just goes on and it's like oh okay
there you go there's the answer and I
vote listen even if you you are further
to the left than I am or then aligator
Ocasio cortezes you have to have an
answer the the point of well we haven't
had the ability to implement this
anywhere yet but obviously it would work
if you give it a chance that's not a
good response cuz that's the same
[ __ ] libertarians say oh we haven't
had a perfect libertarian system
implemented so you can't really point to
okay that's the same [ __ ] communists say
well it wasn't really communism it was
it wasn't implemented properly you have
to have just a clear-cut empirical
answer isn't that right there Oh
Sweden there name a place to work Sweden
that's it that's it
question answered flip it right back on
them empirically when you go to the day
it's true that these countries do
significantly better than we do in
almost every relevant area whether it's
health care life expectancy
self-reported happiness vacation time
you know climbing the the economic
ladder social mobility so you have to
have that cut and dry answer ready and
she did and she did and then that's why
everybody was laughing at Megan McCain
and everybody was cheering for Joy Behar
and then towards the end there
you heard Megan McCain again another
straw man what I want everybody was fill
out your taxes and give 90 percent of
your money to well well hold on hold on
hold on 90 percent tax rate well number
one there was a time in US history
during the Golden Age of economic
expansion as they called it under
Eisenhower where the top the top
marginal tax rate that word marginal is
very important by the way was
ninety-three percent so the US had that
now that was just the nominal rate
that's not what's called the effective
rate so they weren't really paying 93
percent but on paper it was 93 percent
the effective rate was more like 43
percent when you add in all the
loopholes and all the deductions and all
that stuff but the marginal rate means
it only kicks in over a certain point so
it might even be the case okay your
first five million is taxed at a much
lower rate but if you make more than
five million after that it's taxed at 90
percent and then you again you have to
add in deductions and loopholes and then
boom it goes all the way down to 40
percent or 50 percent or whatever it is
the rich are not oppressed
they're gonna be [ __ ] fine but what
she does is she straw man xanax like
under a social democratic system what
you're gonna have is regular people who
make $35,000 a year paying ninety
percent of their money in taxes that is
nothing but a giant lie that's what that
is they have no real rebuttal so they
lie they don't even try to make a
distinction between a marginal tax rate
and a tax rate and an income tax rate
because they want to blur the lines and
they want to confuse you and they want
to mislead you because if they're being
honest and upfront about what they're
arguing against they can't win the
argument so they act like you know
Alexandra Ocasio Cortez wants to raise a
[ __ ] plumber's tax rate to 90%
[ __ ] made-up made-up and grossly
made-up at that so I that went really
well because Joy Behar really held her
own you know I've had huge disagreements
with her in the past if I'm not mistaken
I think she was more Pro Hillary Clinton
and Bernie Sanders which is like whoa
what do you do enjoy that's crazy but
here I mean she really redeemed herself
here because that's exactly how I would
recommend responding to people on the
right who love to strawman love to trot
out Venezuela love to trot out the
Soviet Union a dumbass Republican
Congressmen the other day brought up
North Korea to respond to Ocasio Cortez
and Bernie so listen this is all they
have they this is all they have all they
have are disgusting straw men of what
we're arguing for and when they drop the
straw men it gets even worse for them
because like I said then you get like
that Daily Caller article when they just
explicitly argue against a living wage
and giving people health care okay we
win either way whether you strawman us
we win because you look ridiculous or
whether you explicitly lay out what were
for and then mock it we win because you
don't have a coherent logical argument
against what we're arguing for you just
have scorn it's easy to see how one can
fall for a living wage idea okay where's
your point where's your argument you
have no argument you just like I'm
against it and I'm gonna write it down
okay well you're still helping us
because people gonna read that and go
you haven't made a point against it
you've just laid out that there for a
living wage thank you now I like those
people more they can't beat us they
can't beat us when we actually lay out
our ideas and our philosophy and do it
in a clear way and again if you're ever
presented with somebody who tries to
strawman you don't let him get away with
it
don't let him define you don't fall into
the trap either
because oftentimes what happens is
people try to go no I don't it's not
that I'm a agree with Venezuela but I'm
going to now defend Venezuela and it's
okay to point out the fact that they're
under economic seas they're under
economic warfare with sanctions from the
most powerful country that ever existed
so that definitely in count in part
accounts for why they're in the position
they're in but you don't have to go
above and beyond in defending something
you don't actually believe in now if you
do believe in it okay well then you're
in a position where you gonna have to
defend it
but you know somebody like myself I
don't believe in that system I don't
have to defend that system I don't
believe in the Soviet Union I don't have
to defend this over Union I don't
believe in the Cuban system hours I
defend the Cuban system I only have to
defend what I actually believe in and I
believe in a social democratic system I
believe in the Scandinavian model I
believe in welfare state ISM so okay I
could defend that and I can easily
defend that because it works and because
all the empirical evidence points in
that direction so don't let them off the
hook don't let them strawman you and
that's exactly what Joy Behar did there
and they're gonna keep losing this
debate and keep looking ridiculous
because like I said they have no real
rebuttal
hello everybody I am very happy today to
be talking to Khan yella Inge so Khan
yella Inge is running for Congress he's
a little bit of a superstar if I don't
say so myself you've made quite a name
for yourself at such a young age you're
you're 29 right yeah 20 minutes younger
than me and you're uh you're already
you're already a politician so you are
in the Hawaii House of Representatives
you represent the 11th district which is
South Maui but you hear a little bit of
feedback in your ear no I just heard my
voice talking back to me just wanted to
make sure everything's good on your end
mmm doesn't matter I just want to make
sure you could hear me because I was
getting a little echo of myself but um
so we'll talk policy in a little bit but
before we get into that tell everybody a
little bit about why you got into
politics and about your last race
because I know you had quite a story how
did you win your last race at such a
young age and how did you get out the
vote yeah I mean you know I fight for
working families because I come from one
and when you're when you're working
class in like one of the most richest
places in the world in Hawaii and your
knee deploying you don't have to find
your way into politics it kind of finds
you it threatens your existence so very
early on I was exposed to
you know activism and those arts of
things and then in college I was a first
generation college graduate we had this
Republican governor who tried to cut our
university about 130 million dollars so
my brother convinced me to run for
student president for whatever reason
and we we want and it was like it was
weird because my opponent his dad gave
him like $4,000 they're gonna sit in
campaign he was like part of this huge
fret and the whole fight was helping
them but uh we squeak by and passed like
our first socialist policy or finalize
it which was a bus passes were $400 at
the time but like only poor students
needed them
so we made it so everyone shipping $10
and everybody get a bus pass and people
love it
you know even though even the rich kids
love these and you know we did a lot of
things and then I realize like it is
something I could do so then when a tea
party guy get elected in my home island
when I was 23 I was working at four
seasons at the time cleaning locker
rooms and the weight room from like 4:00
a.m. to noon full-time shift and I just
knock on doors till sunset and we
somehow want despite not having much
money in the key grossly outspent us and
we won by fifteen twenty six percent
might I had a knock on over
$15,000 so either we're out all these
shoes and but you know that's that's
what works like this this this economy
is not working for a generation but
organizing is and really knocking on
doors the only way to build a movement
or the best way to build a movement so
of course as a justice Democrat you're
taking no corporate PAC money but what I
find fascinating and this was obviously
the same for Alexandria Ocasio Cortes is
that I was naive as to how much like
accents around work goes into
campaigning like you were literally I
heard the story that you guys had to hop
fences to go knock on doors is that true
yeah I mean you do everything you can
like you wanted to the only way you're
gonna win as a grassroots candidate is
like when when elections when the polls
close you got to know that you've left
nothing on a table like you gave it your
all so by any means necessary I mean we
didn't get violent but by almost all
means necessary yeah you got to be
extremely resourceful like like our
mayor I used the piece that I used to
mail to walk and I just like you know
punch a hole in it but a rubber band
every single night and I write letters
on each door knocking peace personally
like Aloha kolinsky family I'm like I'm
here to listen to your concerns and I
won't sign it I leave my cell phone and
literally at every door so it's like
that personal touch that's gonna win
people over and just cause like when
you're when you come to a door
they can be have foxnews playing and
extremely conservative but if you're if
you can't say you're not hard working
and they guess you're not listening so
when it's just them in the polling booth
is seven their conscience even if
they're like obsessed with their
worldview they know who you are they
never met the other person they're
probably gonna vote for you and that's
what Democrats have failed to do for
four years we've like written off all
these red states that were originally
that they're people that are like come
from Union backgrounds and stuff and we
got to reconnect and speak to their
needs and that's what justice Democrats
are doing yeah it's um it's really
interesting because I've maintained for
a long time that I think populism wins
everywhere and you know you touched on
it there with people with Union
backgrounds and we saw it just happen in
West Virginia with the teacher strike
the idea that Democrats should write off
states like West Virginia when it's
almost like they're just there waiting
for populist Democrats grassroots
Democrats you know people funded
Democrats to step up and represent them
so this is really an opportunity more
than anything in the age of Trump and I
love I went to your website and I want
to read everybody the quote you have on
the top of your page because I really
like this and this is not something that
you hear in Washington DC in fact the I
think it's the opposite philosophy
that's dominant among Democrats in
Washington DC but you say quote it's not
enough to simply resist Donald Trump
people are struggling and feeling left
behind leaders must offer hope and
progress beyond resistance so can you
speak a little bit about that what
policies would point to this conclusion
well we are campaigning on the policies
that United professors in 2016 like
tuition free public college Medicare for
all ending reckless wars but we're also
pushing the envelope for student debt
cancellation to save our economy and
give our generation a shot universal
basic income a green new deal which
would be to 100% renewable energy
nationwide by 2035 through a federal
jobs guarantee and just kind of you know
pushing as far as we can go because
these are things people need these are
actual solutions and these half-measures
just aren't working and the only reason
why Democrats really afraid of big ideas
is because they're afraid of big donors
so you know when you're on board from
those corporations you can just really
just speak the truth and it's been
really encouraging to see the type of
responses we got them back today I just
rolled out our nation's first housing
for all proposal and you know people are
super excited about it
yeah but you know I'm happy you brought
that up because there's a few policies
they're actually unique and specific to
you among all the Justice Democrats that
I think really a no didn't no offense or
disrespect to any of the other justice
Democrats because I think they're all
great but I think there's a reason why
you really resonated amid a whole cadre
of superstars because you added some
specific things to your platform and at
specific proposals that really are bold
and I know that when when I you know
along with jancuga of TYT when I
discussed your campaign when you
launched on my show and I always give
the link okay if you want to donate
here's the you know the website for
whichever justice Democrat it may be I
know that you actually did got more than
anybody else because I think they saw
those really bold proposals and they
were like wow this guy is the real deal
so one of those that I wanted to talk
about so universal basic income you just
touched on it there you say on your
website automation and globalization are
already disrupting our economy and we
must act quickly and explore innovative
solutions to build a future economy that
leaves no one behind studies and pilots
demonstrate that $1,000 a month basic
income every resident would grow the
American economy by 2.5 trillion dollars
and I know that you also speak a lot
about FDR's economic Bill of Rights so
what what gave you the inspiration like
what what is it that made you are you
just a history buff and you were like
you know what let me see what it was
like back then and then you were going
through the economic policies and they
of the New Deal and you were intrigued
or what is it that made you realize like
oh this is obviously the answer and this
is the direction we should go and this
isn't crazy
pie in the sky as the right and even
some corporate Democrats are gonna paint
it as no I mean I mean first of all
thanks to the frost but I just like
these policies aren't I mean they're
rooted in history sure but they're kind
of easy to stumble upon if you just walk
outside and first of all like zoom out
like like Medicare pro for example why
do we rely on employers to provide our
insurance like it's no one's happy with
that the employer is not even happy with
that though if employees definitely art
it's like a broken system doctors hate
it they got to do more paperwork than
spend time with patients so if you just
think is like just kind of look back a
little there's so much work to be done
outside right there's like trees to be
planted bridges to be repaired roads or
bridges to be built roads to be repaired
and just these the private sector is
just not meeting that demand and
meanwhile there's on unemployed all over
the US or there are people that like we
have a really low unemployment rate but
it's because our jobs on paying off so
people are working two or three jobs and
folks stop looking 70 percent of my
classmates go to the mainland so um you
know why aren't we just providing those
jobs to everyone livable jobs your
federal jobs guarantee it like it's very
simple to come up with these solutions
if you just approach it from like a
common sense perspective same as like
climate change like if they say we need
to reduce emissions by this much let's
just let's just get there let's just dim
bad that corporations stop polluting so
much and you know that we stop making
electric cars by a certain year by 2030
I mean try making fossil fuel cars and
stop those pipelines like it it's very
common sense it's just the only reason
why we don't think it is and people say
it's impossible or radical is because
the donors are doing that propaganda
yeah and I think an interesting point
about that I think is that it would
actually help the economy if we get off
of fossil fuels I mean obviously there's
the benefit of you're gonna fight back
against climate change which is just
absolutely necessary and not debatable
at this point but also I think it'll
help the economy because the next boom
you know is going to be in green and
renewable technology and
why not do a new New Deal and have that
be at the forefront of that
yeah and this green new deal that we've
been championing along with the federal
job guarantee it's been picking up and
you see more and more justice Democrats
and other candidates running on it now
as well and that's a good point like all
of our policies it's not like
anti-growth they're actually all
pro-growth and if you and they cost less
than the the proposals we're looking at
now like under Medicare for all people
will be paying like half as much as they
do under the private sector and sure
it's taxes but who cares there's to be
more money in your pocket you have
better outcomes right no more private
premiums and then your taxes go up but
you're still net paying less is the
point yeah I mean that's the that's the
thing about the profit when you
commodify our basic rights and you put
profit in the mix everyone every layer
you need to add profit and that balloons
the cost like it's pretty simple but and
when it comes to like housing in Hawaii
like I'm looking my window right now
there's like luxury condos every month
popping up and it's like twenty million
dollars for single units getting sold so
this idea that we don't have enough
money on this island or resources to
solve our housing problem is absurd like
just look outside scarcity is a
political choice and all we need to do
is is like demand that the money stopped
getting siphoned out by out-of-state
investors and we build for a human need
rather than in speculative profit yeah
and you know I always felt like if the
news media was doing its job every
American should be able to tell you hey
there's about half a million homeless
people in this country and they should
be able to tell you there's about 50,000
or 60,000 homeless veterans but they
never nobody can tell you that and it's
not their fault necessarily because it's
not like those people it's not like the
America people don't want to help
homeless people don't want to help
homeless veterans it's just that we're
not educated on this stuff and I feel
like what we've lacked in the Democratic
Party and in our politics is a strong
voice for working families and a strong
voice for the poor and homeless
people and I really like how you're
talking about this housing for all idea
you know one of the things I spoke about
this on my show a while ago and this is
one of those facts that it just my mind
is absolutely blown by it and it's again
blown by the fact that this isn't
widespread knowledge and people don't
already know this but apparently if you
just leave a homeless person on the
street and say you know what to hell
with you we're not gonna help you
there's gonna be no government action
here that costs thirty one thousand
dollars per year now if you do a program
where you actually just give homeless
people housing that that mean that would
only cost ten thousand dollars a year so
you save twenty thousand dollars a year
so I mean look at this it's so we know
that it's morally the right thing to do
it's ethically and morally the right
thing to do to address this but it's
also fiscally the right thing to do so
this gets back to what you were saying
about how I mean this is it really is
common sense it like the Justice
Democrats platform and even the things
that you've gone above and beyond and
put in your platform it strikes me like
anybody when they hear this left or
right Republican or Democrat any voter
is gonna go that's what I want to that's
what I want right there yeah I mean you
know there is such thing as like systems
trying to turn people against each other
and scapegoating other populations and
psychologically if you're struggling
it's easier to blame like people even
worse off than you than it is to be to
blame the people that you admire who you
want to be so you know they make us
fight over crumbs under the table while
they sit up there and eat the whole pie
and that's all Donald Trump won right he
identified the pain he's like I see you
struggling but he blamed Muslims and
immigrants and really it's people like
him it's billionaires and oligarchs
that's causing the problem so people
that there are sections of like working
people all across our communities who do
want to blame houseless for their own
problems but that's why it's important
that we get out there and organize
because otherwise they're only hearing
one side of it and when democrats try to
run
to the right especially in these red
states or red areas even in Hawaii we
you know they have to choose between
Republicans Republican lights they
choose Republicans and the people who
are on our side to stay home so we got
excite folk to get them out can I'm
knocking on doors with us talking to
their neighbors having those meaningful
conversations and not just buying TV ads
and that's what we're gonna build a
movement and kind of restore that uh
that heart and soul to not just the
Democratic Party but to working people
of any affiliation yeah so you you made
an interesting point there you touched
on a group of people that I call the TFG
s it stands for too far gone they exist
there's no doubt about that but wait you
mentioned correctly that the middle
class the oldest trick in the book is
elites get the middle class to hate poor
people and people of color and
immigrants and the other and it really
is the oldest trick in the book it's
divide and conquer but I've always
thought that the the too far gone
contingent of the American population is
probably maximum maximum thirty percent
of the country maybe even twenty or
twenty-five percent which means that
there's a voting bloc there where
obviously you can get run-of-the-mill
Democrats to support your your you know
your philosophy your ideology and what
you're pushing for but also independence
and also people who would describe
themselves as conservative but they're
actually more populist and would be
would not even the right label when they
say oh I'm conservative so do you agree
with that do you think that the policies
that we push for the vision is so strong
that it would almost lead to flawless
victories to steal from mortal combat
yeah I do and there'll be a lot less
fatalities well said well said so I just
one more thing here I want you to talk a
little bit more about the job guarantee
so I didn't know this but apparently FDR
when he did the New Deal he almost hit a
hundred percent employment
yeah there's something that's on your
website that's why I'm asking
yeah and that's that's the thing about
like when people say like Harvey enough
for these things when we invest in the
working class and we build it up to the
middle class and we build the middle
class out our economy booms like that
creates like people spend that money
it's not like when you give to the rich
and you have tax cuts and they just
hoard it in all share or store accounts
or buy back stocks like when working
people get money they get haircuts they
get groceries they keep the economy
going economy runs on spending right so
you put money that's sitting in
government coffers you put it back in
the economy and it's it runs at its full
potential so our economy was at its best
when we were investing the most in in
the working-class and so you know a lot
of these policies like a Federal jobs
guarantee universal basic income it's
all based in that empirical historical
fact so a final question talk a little
bit about foreign policy what are your
thoughts on the situation in Iraq what
are your thoughts on the situation in
Afghanistan and what should happen with
u.s. foreign policy moving forward we
spent five point six trillion dollars in
Iraq and Afghanistan
that's that's absurd like we could have
college and Medicare and housing for
everyone with that kind of money but you
know I think it's good when folks talk
about anti interventionism but
anti-imperialism is even better and
frankly I haven't heard any American
politician talk about it that's right so
we're trying to start it out like as
Native Hawaiians we know what it's like
to be displaced from our homeland like
we're an economic and environmental
exile today there are more Hawaiians
living outside our state than here so
you know whether it's a war on drugs or
a war on terror or war whatever hell
good a humans welcome to We the People
live the discussion show for planet
Earth the place that makes debate
healthy again I am your host Josh Zepps
today I wish this were longer I wish it
were a longer conversation Kyle kolinsky
is a talk show host he has a show on the
well it's an affiliate of the Young
Turks Network his YouTube show is called
secular talk he has over a half a
million subscribers he has almost a half
a billion video views over 120,000
followers on Twitter all by articulating
a very passionate defense of the left
wing of the Democratic Party I could
have spoken like I say for 2 for 2 or 3
hours with him about all kinds of things
but we try to hop scotch around a bunch
of things that are in the political
either and I think he's an interesting
representative all open he and I don't
agree on everything he's an interesting
representative of one way of approaching
a political reason at the moment and of
opposing what we might regard as the
forces of darkness and evil in a way
that articulates a very passionate and
robust and ballsy vision of the left I
won't speak for him I will let him speak
for him without further ado ladies and
gentlemen I bring to you Kyle Kaminski
this is We the People
Kyle thanks so much for being on the
show thanks for having me man I
appreciate it
this is I think this is a good
opportunity for me to talk to as many
other people who have been buzzing
around the pod sphere new media world on
both sides of the political aisle
because we all seem so hunkered down
into our political camps that I want to
understand how other people are thinking
about the current political moment can
you give people who maybe only vaguely
aware of you a snapshot of where you sit
oh sure I mean I would describe my
politics as populist to left you know
more probably a simpler way to explain
that is I'm sympathetic to social
democracy so that means that in the
context of the u.s. I would be left of
the Democratic Party on economic issues
and feel kind of stranded and lonely on
the national scene I mean there are some
people who represent a huge primary win
in New York City having you with this uh
this this barnstorming young Latina
woman who has knocked off the the old
fuddy-duddy guy in the Democratic Party
well that's right and that's actually
she's a one of the first Justice
Democrats and I was a co-founder of that
group justice Democrats so we have had
some wins that's for sure but you know
nationally you have Bernie Sanders in
the Senate Elizabeth Warren half the
time and then yeah like you mentioned
Alexandria Ocasio Cortes who will be
going to Congress and you have ROH
Khanna in Congress Raul Grijalva there's
a few maybe I'm overstating it and I'm
sorry what is this justice group that
you were talking about it's called
justice Democrats and basically the idea
was to get Bernie Sanders style
Democrats to take over the Democratic
Party and you know pretty much get the
Democratic Party off of corporate money
is the gist of it and get them to be
more like old-school FDR New Deal style
Democrats what about the predictable
response that you must get all the time
which is that the fundamental reality is
that voters in America a center-right
people they are not Danes they have
never
voted successfully for candidates well
not in the past half-century for
candidates who espouse the kind of
progressive views that that you embrace
they've only gone for Democrats when
they're quasi sort of Blue Dog Democrats
like Bubba Clinton and and even to some
extent Obama who tried to pave this very
very centrist way and maybe you think
that it blow up in his face but enough
Americans think that he was too far left
that they're never going to jump on your
bandwagon so that's a great question it
turns out that that narrative which is
the predominant narrative in US politics
among Democratic strategists is just
factually incorrect so when you look at
the past few decades actually in
democratic politics you find very
quickly that this notion that you know
kind of centrist Democrats who are okay
with corporate money and willing to be a
part of the establishment they've gotten
their butt handed to them I'm saying but
when I normally say another word I don't
know if I could curse on your show so
you sure go for it what do we what is
actually quite a quaint and polite word
for the level of this show so that's
you're in good company well we're gonna
start with us and we can gradually we
can gradually graduate up to [ __ ] we'll
break it right now these guys got their
[ __ ] asses handed to them and yeah so
they lost a thousand seats using this
philosophy you know and under Nancy
Pelosi Chuck Schumer and Barack Obama
what do you mean by four thousand states
over what period of time are we talking
about under their leadership so you go
from Barack Obama being a so actually
predates Obama to so say 2004 until
today we've had the Democrats lose
because they had a super majority under
Obama and then it was squandered very
quickly and yeah but the reason it was
surely the reason it was squandered I
mean what's wrong with the narrative
that the reason it was squandered is
because he tried the most progressive
overhaul of health care that had ever
been attempted in another great question
so that that caused the 2010 the 2010
backlash of the tea my response to that
is he actually didn't try the most
progressive overhaul in fact he did the
Heritage Foundation's plan yeah you know
so that I guess there are two there are
two points here that it's worth not
conflating one is what was the actual
policy and the other is what was the
rhetoric around the backlash to the
policy that led the Democrats to suffer
an electoral defeat so the actual policy
I agree with you was a sort of fairly
moderate Republican market-based policy
but there's but it's ridiculous to
imagine I think that had it been a
full-blooded medicare-for-all policy
that the chance of get your government
hands off our healthcare system this is
a government takeover of health care and
especially given that the the medical
establishment wouldn't have been on side
for that whereas they were on side for
for Obamacare the very powerful doctors
Lobby and so on it I kind of met and how
the backlash would have been less well I
mean it's easy to imagine it actually
when you look at the polls today because
for example over 60% of the American
people today support Medicare for all
and the game-changer on that front was
of course Bernie Sanders actually
bothering to make an argument see that's
the thing that's annoyed me for so long
about the Democratic Party and that's
why we did justice Democrats it's one of
many reasons but they they never fought
and they never actually believed in the
ideas that they were supposed to believe
in if they if they actually were part of
this strain of thought
along with FDR's New Deal philosophy so
basically the point is they've abandoned
their roots now remote you gotta
remember FDR the Republicans had to come
up with term limits to try to make sure
that we'd never get another situation
like they were in because FDR was so
wildly popular that they're like we
literally just can't beat this guy and
he was kind of a run-of-the-mill social
democrat and I'm of the belief that and
of course the polls reflect this today
but even at times where the polls do not
reflect it and I think you do have an
argument on that front the further back
you go so around like you know 2008 2009
Medicare for all was not over 50% but my
whole point all along was that we need
to have Democrats who are educating the
public and willing to make strong
arguments in favor of things that they
should value and again to bring back
Bernie Sanders he he did a fantastic job
pointing out the
basic fact that every other developed
country has one version or another of a
single-payer system and that we're
lagging behind the rest of the world on
this front and that's just an empirical
fact you can't argue against it so the
thing that's annoyed me is that you know
the more the right shrieks endlessly
about how like you mentioned Obamacare
is this government takeover of health
care and it's terrible and they have
death panels and if we had strong
populist left Democrats the response to
that could have been we already have
death panels it's called Blue Cross Blue
Shield in Humana
it's called for-profit health insurance
companies so that's basically all I'm
asking for all Justice Democrats is
asking for we want Democrats to be what
they should have been all along and
we're also be willing to guarantee
better election results because when you
have strong Social Democrats willing to
make an argument and argue for ideas
that are actually already overwhelmingly
popular you tend to win hmm I think what
you and I see totally eye-to-eye is that
even if we put aside the electoral
plausibility of the ideas that you're
putting forth being popular right now
there is a long-term game that the
Republicans have been playing which is
let's just shift the the kind of
parameters of the discourse you know
what the what the geeks call the Overton
Window the meaning the the kind of
window in which an idea is regarded as
being a legitimate thing for discussion
among sensible people and things like
you know abolishing the EPA would it
when would've just been insane
they wouldn't have you would have been
laughed out of the room even just twenty
or thirty years ago I mean it was Nixon
who created the EPA now they are popular
punch lines at Republican primary
debates and so the audacity of pushing
as far out as you can and and defending
the most extreme position in the
knowledge that you're never going to
quite get that probably but but you're
certainly gonna get a better deal than
you would have if you'd started by being
meek and modest I mean this I think
everyone now agrees that this was
Obama's kind of frustrating failure that
he would always go into positions
assuming the best of his opponents and
and beginning with an opening gambit
that was quite weak and tolerant of the
other side's considerations at which
point there
would scream and call him a socialist
communist Kenyan and that he'd end up
with something that was halfway between
his moderate position in their extreme
position whereas if he'd gone exactly an
opening gal but there was extreme you
could have ended up somewhere halfway
between the two so yeah I think even if
even if I'm right that there is no
actual electoral consensus for Medicare
for all right now I agree with you that
it makes sense for the Democrats to have
some spine and articulate positions that
are considerably to the left of the ones
that they've traditionally embraced
simply so that they're in a stronger
position to negotiate something halfway
there so the only part of that analysis
that I would disagree with is just a
point that I mean every poll I've seen
within the past two years has shown
medicare-for-all way over fifty percent
I thought I posed as much as you do Kyle
I think that when you get into the
rough-and-tumble like I think I think I
think if you call someone while they're
having dinner and you say do you think
everyone should have free health care
from the government they're like
munching on a lamb chop and they're like
yeah yeah sure and then when you get
into the rough-and-tumble of a political
campaign where your opponents are
spending you know literally hundreds of
millions or even billions of dollars
that are coming from medical device
manufacturers and the doctors lobby and
all of that running scare campaigns
about a government takeover then whether
or not they actually vote for the
candidate who is proposing that thing is
a different question well yeah and I
think that again another part that ties
into that is how effective are they at
making an argument I mean that's another
part of Paul it's kind of a lost art in
politics it's the idea of being able to
sell your ideas in a way that's actually
effective and I mean I know this is a
perhaps an awkward time to bring up
Trump because he doesn't really have a
coherent philosophy and that goes
without saying but as far as being a
Salesman and and marketing and being
repetitive and going on the offense mmm
I think he's actually a political genius
in that respect yeah I would also
actually dispute what you just said that
you said it goes without saying that he
doesn't have a coherent political
philosophy I think part of his success
and part of what has baffled people who
crave a certain level of intellect and
competence in politics and what is so
aggravating to Trump's critics like us
is that we can't see what the his
coherent political philosophy is but
through a series of sort of subtle dog
whistles and also not at all subtle
bombastic tweets his political
philosophy is quite clear to the people
who who dig it and I think it's it's
something like we've been being stabbed
in the back forever it's a pretty it's a
pretty common political philosophy
amongst populist and authoritarians
actually we've been being stabbed in the
back forever by a feat namby-pamby x'
who don't have the backbone to stand up
for our own interests and we've been
sold down the river in deals that are
stitched up between K Street lobbyists
in Washington and Wall Street finances
I'm the only guy who's actually
independent doesn't take doesn't need to
take swamp money like the rest of them
so let's make this country great and
start looking after numero uno instead
of prancing around the the world in on
Air Force One like the the black guy the
last black guy did selling out selling
out our coal industry for to eurofags
and [ __ ] and climate hysterics you
know it's time to it's time to grow up
and I think like every everything that
he does is suffused with that whether
it's blocking children in cages
separating them from their families at
the border it's like now the grown-ups
are in charge you know we're not gonna
be when up if there's no more mr. nice
guy like we are we are gonna defend
ourselves and we're gonna put ourselves
first and if you're a different color
and if you're foreign and if you're if
you're from a different political
philosophy then you can eat [ __ ] and die
cuz like America got great by by being
great not by [ __ ] I'm singing Kumbaya
and being and being Denmark like that to
me is his overarching political
philosophy and it says bright and is
clear to me as a Trump sign on top of a
skyscraper see the funny thing is that
like I remember his closing political ad
I actually thought it was really good in
that it was hard-hitting and he really
tried to make this case that it's like
kind of like you touched on there it's
me versus the establishment it's me
versus the elites which is you know a
theme that people across the political
spectrum could actually relate to and
they think yeah you know I have gotten a
rough deal and I don't think people on
Wall Street in Washington DC you're
looking out for me but then the reason
why I said you know I can't really
ascertain a clear political philosophy
from him or Co here in political
philosophy from him is that as far as I
could tell
she's done the bidding of the
establishment I mean look at his tax
bill for example you know it would cut
the corporate tax rate from thirty one
percent to twenty five percent it gutted
the estate tax and raised it from
applying to people with over five
million dollars in net worth to over
eleven million dollars and net worth and
we can go down the list here I mean all
of the the deregulatory actions the fact
that he's pointing people to head
agencies that basically don't want those
agencies to exist whether it's EPA or
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
so I mean in many ways Trump to me
actually seems like a his actions his
policies are very much like a standard
establishment Republican he's just an
establishment Republican plus mean
tweets which know if that's important
that's important Kyle because it depends
how you define establishment you define
the establishment in the way that I
think a reasonable progressive person
defines the establishment which is very
rich powerful people very very rich old
white guys who run things but his base
regards the establishment as cult as a
cultural thing not so much an economic
thing and I think his base like is it's
often been observed by Western European
analysts that that the the peculiar
thing about Americans is that they all
think they're gonna be rich like even if
it doesn't end up happening they're all
like rich guys they've want everyone in
America this whole ethos of the land of
opportunity and pulling yourself up by
your bootstraps like no matter how many
times you you look at the economic
numbers and you see that social mobility
from like the bottom quintile to the top
quintile in the United States is far
lower than it is in other countries that
have more progressive policies there's
still this this widespread American
belief that it is the place where
anything is possible and to give
credence to that point of view that is
somewhat true because it is hard to
imagine an Obama coming out of nowhere
and becoming the prime minister of
Germany or Australia it wouldn't happen
because there are too many too many
impediments in their path and it's hard
to imagine an Oprah Winfrey being an
Oprah Winfrey in another country but
these are extreme outliers and the mere
fact that America facilitates the rise
of extreme outliers like they're more
Elon Musk or something like that doesn't
mean that it's a more egalitarian place
that's all just a slight aside to
to say I agree with your point about
your baffle that he has just gone in and
he is like playing in the swamp iasts
womp that there's been in our living
memory I mean I can't remember an
administration that was so swampy if you
regard the establishment as being rich
it pokes who don't want the government
to interfere in their business but if
you like rich [ __ ] pokes and you
empathize with their desire for the
government not to poke their nose in
your business and your definition of the
establishment is government bureaucrats
who are who have never done anything in
the real world in their lives and
they're just writing regulations that
make industry less competitive and that
sell America down the stream and make
your life harder by raising taxes and
increasing paperwork and if you see
people going in there with their swords
and even if they are a bit dirty like
Scott Pruett they're cut they're
slashing away at things and making life
easier for the for the men who really
built this country and I say men
advisedly cuz I think there's a lot of
sexism in this world view as well then
Trump is anti-establishment because he's
anti he's anti regulators he's anti
pipsqueaks and he's anti all of these
cultural effete transgender you know
[ __ ] who have got too many TV shows
and who applauded each other too much at
the at the Oscars
like if that's your conception of the
the goofballs over at FoxNews want to
talk to us about evidence for God check
it out Rodrigo Duterte has defied anger
the Catholic Church and Christians
worldwide after he said he wouldn't quit
if someone could prove to him that God
exists hello and welcome to spirited
debate I'm Lauren Green Duterte has been
in office just two years but critics say
he has become isolated at home and
abroad in part because of his spat with
the church he not only defied the
existence of God but used expletives to
describe the god of the judeo-christian
Bible so is it worth taking up the
tortoise challenge or should he just be
ignored and here with his thoughts is
dr. alex macfarlane author director of
christian worldview North Greenville
University welcome Alex well thank you
Lauren it's good to be with you well I
hear that does since then the turkey has
actually apologized to God but I'm
interested in just in you first what
your reaction to all this is well you
know he's not the first person that's
been on record sort of uh denigrating
God or slamming God you know fifty years
ago John Lennon of the Beatles had to
make a Maher culpa for saying the biddle
Beatles are bigger than Jesus and then I
don't know 25 years ago or so Ted Turner
said we need to get rid of the Ten
Commandments and have the ten
suggestions or ten voluntary initiatives
and then there was pushback but at at
one point the President of the
Philippines there said God or the idea
of God was stupid but I just read in
prepping for this interview that he's
apologized to God and if that be the
case I'm glad to hear it and hope it was
sincere well maybe he just got a sudden
sense of pragmatism because you know the
Philippines is a largely Catholic nation
and him has as head of state what's not
showing a lot of sanity and talking
disparagingly about God well yeah I mean
that's a pretty counterproductive I
would think that if your constituency
loves the Lord then you you better not
maybe you don't love the Lord but at
least you don't want to slam the the
Savior that they believe in but here's
what he said it was interesting in his
apology to God he said I want to be
clear I'm apologizing to God and no one
he said but the god I believe in my god
is all forgiving and and - that - he or
anyone I would say that is true God is
all forgiving but we have to come to God
humbly the Bible tells us that if we
will turn to Jesus Christ and say Lord
I'm sorry for my sins and I thank you
that you paid for my sins on the cross
that Christ will forgive he can be
forgiven duarte or I was I found that
forgiveness at 21 and so this is a
message that we all need to hear that
that God is all forgiving but we have to
come to him humbly and repentantly well
why don't we ask you a question because
he brings up the question though but
can't can anyone prove that God exists
in a sense in other words question is
you know what proof is there that if
there's a God he would give you proof
that he exists you know it really
becomes this deep philosophical question
and even though he is apologized the
questions to lose out there is it
possible to have an objective standard
to prove that God exists I think it
absolutely is and we have to qualify
what people mean by proof if they mean a
mathematical proof like we could
determine at what temperature steel
melts or something like that
no but you can't mathematically prove
that George Washington crossed the
Delaware but in in terms of what's
called a statistical proof or the
preponderance of evidence God is an
absolutely logical likely inference
creation had to have a creator design
had to have a designer the the moral law
came from a moral lawgiver so when you
look at all that we know about life the
most logical inference and admission is
there is an all-powerful creator a
supernatural eternal God that is beyond
this timely world a timeless God and
creator so I would say yes it is
possible to prove God not in the sense
of a mathematical theorem but in a most
logical conclusion based on all the
observable evidence yeah no okay where
do I begin with this one
so first of all I love what outrageous
people I mean it was probably duterte is
carrying out a genocide of drug sellers
drug users so you would think that that
would get the bulk of the ire from the
media like oh my goodness he's openly
talking about how regular people should
kill drug users in the street about how
you know people should kill their
siblings their their loved ones if
they're drug users and okay if you don't
have the heart to do it well then just
let the cops do it so and the body count
is ticking up man thousands of people
have been murdered in this drug
crackdown this anti drug crusade and by
the way he's also accused of being
addicted to fentanyl the strongest
opioid on the planet so as a guy is
taking drugs and the strongest drug he's
acting like Oh drugs are evil and drugs
are bad and we kill people for doing
drugs so duterte is a menace and I have
zero love for duterte but the thing
about all I'll quit if you prove to me
God exists I'm sure it was an offhanded
comment
I'm sure Duterte is an atheist not an
atheist because he's an intellectual and
he actually you know thought about it
and you know read about the topic no I'm
sure he's an atheist in the same way
that you know my friends uncle is an
atheist which is like he's angry at the
world for whatever reason he's just like
there can't be a god because I don't I'm
not a happy person there are there are
atheists like that I think we all have
to admit that even though I I'm somebody
who's not religious I'm somebody who's
an atheist but yeah I see different
kinds of atheists I see atheists who are
atheists because they're intellectuals
and I see atheists who are atheist
because it's just like they're angry at
what they thought was a god and so
they're like well God might must not
exist because I'm just not happy so he
strikes me as that kind of a person he's
just like an angry dude and so he's like
yeah if you prove God to me I'll step
down that's an easy side thing to say
and just throw it out there because you
know nobody's gonna prove it to you
because it there isn't a god or at the
very least there's no evidence for a God
so
I love how that triggers the media
because as I uh
look how arrogant this guy is stating
things that are totally accurate it's
like that's not I mean what an on bet to
make like okay prove God to me and I'll
step down
nobody ously nobody's gonna prove that
it's not even a cut a comment worth
commenting on
so they mentioned how you know oh
there's all these examples of people who
have made similar statements and there
was a backlash who was it the Beadle
said they're bigger than Jesus
yeah that's I'm saying we're really
really big it's not them putting down
Jesus although he's acting like you was
interpreted that way
I believe it probably was interpreted
that way or Ted Turner Oh get rid of the
Ten Commandments listen man that
shouldn't even be controversial if you
were to make a list of ten things that
people should never do that list is like
at least half wrong I pulled them up
while he was talking there you shall
have no other gods before me is one of
the commandments
okay strike one you're out that on the
list if you're making a list of ten
things you should never do that doesn't
make the list you shall have no other
gods before me is the first one you
shall not make for yourself an idol so
don't do idol worship why why some
people when they're growing up they look
at their dad if their dad is a strong
you know figure and provides and teaches
them about life yeah that's my idol my
dad why there's nothing wrong with if
you're a musician and you know whatever
you like we just mentioned the Beatles
if you're a musician oh my god I idolize
the Beatles I want to be like them
people get inspiration from all types
thing what's wrong with that cuz their
idols not God and that's bad it's just
so weird that doesn't make a list of the
10 most important things don't misuse
the name of Lord your God oh please are
we [ __ ] serious and we're three in
and none of them have been good yet
remember the Sabbath day by keeping it
holy for four of them wouldn't make the
list of the ten most important things
honor your mother and father wrong what
if your mother and father were [ __ ]
murderers what if they're lowlife drug
addicts who never took care of you and
you were raised by your grandma what
about that what about that so stupid
okay here we go finally one that's real
and we're on the sixth one don't murder
you
yes that would make the list of the 10
most important things don't commit
adultery that wouldn't make the list of
the 10 most important things you
shouldn't do it but you know hey child
rape should be on that list and it's not
rape in general should be on that list
it's not slavery should be on that list
don't do slavery it's not on the list
but they did find time to say you know
don't do adultery don't steal ok good
you shall not give false testimony
against your neighbor ok you shall not
covet anything that belongs to your
neighbor don't [ __ ] your neighbor's wife
I think is that one but dude listen come
on man come on the Ten Commandments are
totally outdated they're not a list of
the 10 most important things you
shouldn't do just because a few of them
are good like don't murder and don't
steal people like well obviously that's
the list of the things you should never
do coming straight from God know if it
was straight from God 10 out of 10 would
be the things you definitely shouldn't
do now now let's get to the meat of it
though he says well is it possible to
prove God it's not mathematically
provable ok thank you that's correct
it's not but it is statistically
provable what if you look at the
preponderance of the evidence what
evidence what are you talking about son
and then he says well you know hey the
design had to have a designer listen
here's the deal
that argument falls apart just by doing
a little bit of logical deduction so ok
in order for everything to look so
intricate and in order for everything
that seems so complex I mean look I have
an eye my eye is capable of seeing
what's out there in the world so what my
eye must be so complex and it's so
designed that it must have a designer or
else my eye wouldn't function properly
so the reason why that's [ __ ] is any
God that would have done would have had
the ability to do all of this creation
all of this designing make all of this
complain
city that God by definition would have
to be way more complex than this world
the designer has to be way more complex
than the thing that they designed but
then that begs the next question who
designed the designer so if something
this complex had to be designed okay
well then we had a designer but that
designer was also complex in fact even
more complex than us so who designed the
designer and then who designed the
designer of the designer if complex
things need to have a designer then
that's a never-ending chain backwards of
somebody had to design the designer and
then somebody had to design the designer
of the design and then somebody had to
and so on and so forth so that's not an
argument that's not an argument because
if you're actually what they're doing is
and they don't realize it but what
they're doing is scrapping one question
and replacing it with an even harder
question see they think that's an answer
that's not an answer it's the lack of an
answer because you just proposed an even
harder question if something complex
needs a designer well then our designers
even more complex than us so who
designed the designer so now listen I'm
I don't know I don't know the nature of
the universe
I don't know how everything is the way
it is I'm not a [ __ ] genius over here
I just know that what this guy saying is
[ __ ] and I think on some level he
knows it's [ __ ] and if he didn't
know was [ __ ] show him this clip and
by the end of it if he's being honest
with himself he'll know that what he
said there was [ __ ] and the final
point is and this actually is funny that
I'm covering us today because I just had
a run-in with ben shapiro on twitter
about this a few days ago he tweeted
something so ariana grande released a
goofy song like god is a woman or
there's no evidence for God and why are
we even talking about God let's not talk
about a wizard in space that's my song
no Wizards in space no Jigglypuff in
space there's my song Arianny like that
sing that one for me okay so she
releases a song called God is a woman
silly whatever I didn't listen to it I
don't care
ben shapiro takes that song and he you
know tweeted some hashtag and he doesn't
know how to do the hashtags properly
when you do a long hashtag you got to
capitalize the beginning of each letter
or else it gets lost he said something
like god is you know outside of the is
real and outside of the realm of space
and time or something like that and then
i responded him and said what happened
to fax over feelings he's the guy I care
about fax over her explaining in a tweet
about God is outside of the [ __ ]
realm we know of but he's definitely
there
that's not fact that's your feeling so
that's what this guy said he goes well
we the preponderance of the evidence
suggests that God is beyond this world
there's literally no way you can know
that because beyond this world is by
definition beyond the world so you're in
the world
you're not beyond the world so to say
like oh gods beyond the world you don't
[ __ ] know what do you dude listen the
only intellectually honest positions are
agnostic and atheist okay agnostic is
just somebody who gives us straight-up
flat out I don't know I don't know I
don't know
atheist is somebody who says I don't
know but I haven't seen any evidence of
therefore I'm going to might I'm going
to default to no those are the only two
intellectually honest positions if you
deviate from that you're lying to
yourself to yourself it's not about me
it's not about anybody else it's about
you though you're lying to yourself if
you do that so anyway that's my long
segment here but Fox News talking about
God in 2018 and doing this thing where
they're pretending to be serious well it
may not be mathematically proven well
but the preponderance of the evidence
suggested it's statistically possible
maybe
[ __ ] off [ __ ] off that's not you're not
making any sense and you probably know
it on some level
what it do what it do [ __ ] how's my
volume level how's my volume level
where's my snare
I have no snare on my headphones I was
just watching that Chappelle's Show skit
yesterday fisticuffs
he can't hear he's like where's my snare
no I'm serious where's my snare I can't
hear turn it up turn it up I can't here
on my left headphone Chappelle show is
probably the greatest thing ever
69 viewers uh-huh uh that's a nice
number uh-huh okay this went live
quicker than usually usually there's
like a countdown
there wasn't a countdown this time um I
just went to the eye doctor and I can
now see for the first time in like a
year it is [ __ ] amazing how my
eyesight got like gradually worse and I
didn't even like I didn't realize it it
was uh it's just like creeped up on me
and then so I go to the eye doctor today
and dude gives me I get some some
contact some more contacts but dude
gives me a pair to wear out to like take
and holy [ __ ] it was like the first time
I'd seen in like a year I didn't realize
how horrible my eyes are and everybody
knows I play golf and it got to the
point where like I would hit a golf shot
I'd hit a drive and I'd have to be like
where'd that ball go I have no idea
where that went like I could see the
ball take off but then I couldn't see a
land and I'd always have to ask people
like where'd that end up it got to the
point where I could sit in my bed and I
would look at the time on the TV like
the little time thing and it would be
blurry and I would have to like squint
somebody says hey Kyle you got me to
create him I'm taking the green strain
now what kind do you use all strains
I'll use red they'll use green just
depends on my mood Green is more of an
uppy strain red is more of a downer
relaxing strain my go-to is probably tie
red vein um but I like all the strains
and by the way guys hold off for just a
little bit on the super chats I'm gonna
get to your super chats later but first
I want to talk about some stuff before
we get to the super chats okay so I made
a little list I made a little list for
yes okay so the first thing is I
actually have to tweet a pole for this
I'm gonna I'm gonna do a Twitter poll
here now I have mixed feelings on
political labels on the one hand I feel
like there's an over-reliance on labels
and when people only talk about labels
and annoys the [ __ ] out of me
I feel like Dave Rubin is a big offender
on this front like he loves his just
throw around labels and act like that
makes him an intellectual like I'm a
classical liberal and missus and you
know they'll pontificate on just labels
for an hour and it's like okay are you
gonna get to a point at any point so on
the one hand I think there's this over
reliance on labels but then on the other
hand they're necessary they're necessary
because when somebody tries to when
you're trying to sum up where somebody
falls on the political spectrum I hate
to burst everybody's bubble but you all
do fit into this some sort of a box now
you there are minor deviations here and
there but there is a political ideology
that most accurately describes or a
political label that most accurately
describes where you fall on the spectrum
now if you listen to my show you know
for a long time I've thrown around a few
different labels that I've you know I'm
relatively comfortable with and I think
are accurate when describing my beliefs
but they all have their downfalls so I
got to try to figure out how to word
this basically I want to ask what do you
like more as a descriptor like give your
somebody who watches this show and
you're inclined to agree with me on like
90% or more of the issues what do you
like as a descriptor so let me see how
should i phrase this
what political label is the most
accurate descriptor hmm how high-level
is what political label is the most
accurate descriptor I was gonna say if
you tend to agree with me but that
sounds kind of douchey what political
label is the most accurate descriptor
for you
I guess I'll put but then there's gonna
be right-wingers who are like none of
those and there's gonna be moderates who
are like none of those [ __ ] I put in
parentheses they're all similar
so this poll is for those all in this
place on the spectrum no hmm what
political label is the most accurate
descriptor for you anyway guys you're
the options I'm just gonna tell you them
here and then I'll figure out a way to
word it maybe you guys can help me word
it here but I want to put libertarian
left populist left and Social Democrat
those are the three which one do you
like most out of those three now how
should I word this what political label
is the most accurate descriptor for you
and then I put those three does that
sound like a good idea
somebody say it in the chat tell me what
you think about this Nazi communist
somebody put Nazi communists that was
good everybody's giving me their answer
to the question how should I word the
poll is my question
populist
left you guys aren't listening to me are
you
how should I word the poll that's the
question what political label is the
most accurate descriptor for you and
then put those three does that sound
good to you guys or is that not good
this was a bad idea Kyle you're the gay
frog I'm having too much fun with this
uh chat you guys are going too fast I
think I'm gonna have to put on the post
per minute thing
oh whatever let's see live control room
info and settings I'm such a noob even
though I've done this like a bunch of
times info and settings no no that's not
it what are you gonna do no big deal all
right I'm just wording it the way I put
it I think I worded it in a really
shitty way but I'm gonna go with that
and just see what you guys say which
political what political label is the
most accurate descriptor for you what
political label do you like the most I'm
going with that of these options boom
got it
alright populist left libertarian left
social [ __ ] I like this poll I like a
lot I'll do a two-hour poll what
political label do you like - most of
these options populist left libertarian
left Social Democrat okay I'm posting
this now so go vote in that Twitter poll
guys because I'm trying to I'm tired of
when somebody asked me hey where do you
fall on the spectrum what do you like
what would you describe yourself as I'm
tired of saying like all of those you
know what I mean like throwing all of
them out there and saying well I would
describe myself as this
but also kind of this and also kind of
this I want to I want to kind of settle
on one of those but they all have their
downfalls so here's why I don't like
just progressive okay I'm tired of it
I'm tired of it I think it's worn out I
think that it used to not have a
negative connotation to it and then now
over over the years it's it has somewhat
of a negative connotation to it maybe
some of that negative connotation is
deserved but some of it's not deserved
but I'm just tired of the word
progressive it just strikes me as like
it's just boring and stale and I don't
think it's a great descriptor because
there's a lot of variation among people
who describe themselves as progressive
so like they're progressives who I would
consider relatively authoritarian where
they don't have the same belief on
freedom of speech that I do and there
may be very big disagreements between me
and some other people who describe
themselves as progressive so I think
it's kind of like an old term now it's
an annoying term not only that
historically when you look at the term
progressive like the actual progressive
era in u.s. politics which started I
think in like the 1890s and went to like
the 1920s those progressives were not
all that progressive like for example
they were in favor of prohibition they
actually propped up segregation as the
status quo so like the original
progressives had some like massive
downsides and then now in the modern era
the definition has evolved but I'm just
not a fan of using that word because I
think it's so broad and so vague and
also just kind of stale and annoying and
old and I'm just tired of it so
progressive I'm leaving off because I
just don't like that I don't like
liberal either because liberal I think
is again is too vague but also now you
have people describing themselves as
classical liberals and that has you know
I don't want to be lumped in with that
group because I have massive
disagreements with many of the people
who describe themselves as classical
liberals and that's another label I
think is kind of tired and and way too
broad to encompass where I would fall on
the political spectrum
now there are downsides to the ones I
just tweeted though - okay and by the
way guys just for a little bit hold off
on on the super chats because I got a
bunch of stuff I want to talk about and
then I'll get to the super chats so the
downside of let's go let's go one by one
for each one
the downside of populist left that has
the least downside I think populism is
on the rise populism is something that I
think is very good now it is true that
there are right-wing populist also or at
least fake right-wing populist so maybe
that'll model you know muddy the waters
a little bit muddy is that a word
muddled muddy the waters whatever it is
and it might confuse some people but you
say left right after populist so I think
that's a relatively I think that's a
good descriptor I like I like the term
populist left I think that encompasses
where I fall on the political spectrum
pretty well libertarian left I also like
but I think the downside of libertarian
left is again when people hear
libertarians sometimes their brain will
shut off and they'll immediately think
you know like anarcho-capitalist and i
do not want anybody to affiliate
whatever i label myself as with
anarcho-capitalist I mean the
libertarian and libertarian left
obviously comes from being libertarian
on social issues and left on economic
issues but can people make that
distinction
I don't know now as far as social
democrat i feel like that's lacking that
descriptor leaves too much unsaid for
social issues I mean I know it's social
democrat but Italy it doesn't give
people a good understanding of where you
fall on social issues so somebody could
be a social democrat and when you hear
that you think of all the economic stuff
you think of okay therefore welfare
state ISM so therefore universal health
care and universal education but it
doesn't say much about you know where
they would fall on marijuana like
somebody could be in favor not in favor
of legalizing marijuana and be a social
democrat like that is possible you can
have social beliefs that are more in
favor of
and more in favor of order and hierarchy
and still be a social democrat released
I think you can you can fall in that
group like some of the I don't know all
the positions of the Social Democratic
parties in Scandinavia but my guess is
that if you go issue for issue I
actually wouldn't agree with them on
everything so I think that that that's a
term that's already you know it
generally describes where I fall on the
spectrum because I tend to agree with
them completely on economic issues or
overwhelmingly on economic issues but I
think it just leaves too much unsaid in
the other realm like social issues and
again that that's kind of the same with
populist left to like you here populist
left and you think more economics
there's still questions about well hey
where do they fall on social issues
where do they fall on abortion where
they fall in legalizing marijuana where
they fall on something like euthanasia
so it's a it's a it's a difficult
question and I've kind of gone back and
forth with where the exact term I would
want to use to describe myself now for
people who are familiar with the show
you already and it pretty much nowhere I
fall on most of the issues but I'm a
huge proponent of Medicare for all I'm a
huge proponent of free college I I think
we should have paid vacation time by law
I think we should have strong unions I
think we should have a living wage I
wouldn't describe myself as
post-capitalist though I mean I think
there are some ideas that flirt with
that realm like I like the idea of
worker owned co-op
everybody kind of makes the decision
democratically in the workplace but I
also wouldn't ban the traditional
hierarchy where you have an owner or a
boss and then people working under that
owner or boss because I think some
people do just want to clock in and do
their work and then leave and not
directly participate in a democratic
sense to run a company so I'm kind of in
favor of both in that sense worker owned
cooperative myself as totally post
capitalist I do think social democracy
and the Scandinavian model is the best
it the best systems we have in the world
right now and I think that's empirically
proven but I just struggle with exactly
how
I would if somebody asked me and I have
to give one label hey where would you
fall I don't know I think I think I lean
towards the one that's losing right now
so far there's been over a thousand
votes and twenty-three percent say
populist left twenty four percent say
libertarian left and fifty three percent
say social democrat so social democrat
is kind of crushing I think I personally
lean towards using populist left because
that's not I think that's more original
than any of the others and it also I
think does probably best explain where I
fall because populist is okay so what is
popular what do the people want and when
you go through the opinion polls it's on
almost every issue that I'm with the
majority at least of the American people
but I'm sure if you looked at polls from
other developed countries I'm right
smack dab in the middle of them as well
because I mean maybe there's a few
issues where that's not the case like I
don't I'm not in favor the death penalty
because oftentimes we kill the wrong
people four percent of the time I think
that poll the death penalty is under
fifty percent in the US so maybe that's
an example of one area where I'm
actually not populist I'm against the
majority but on almost every issue I'm
right smack dab in the middle so I'm
very curious what you guys are gonna say
here I mean it looks like you're it
almost looks it done already because
Social Democrat is fifty two percent I'm
a little surprised by that to be honest
because Social Democrat is already like
it's already a thing and it's also a
little broad I like populist left
because it's not it's kind of like a new
phenomenon like a new label people are
using like there was a time when if you
said populist it was almost always
right-wing but I like the idea of
populist left because we actually are
populist
and we are on the left and nobody really
uses that or that's a modern thing if
anybody uses it it's very recent that
people started using populist and left
together so anyway that's my random
spiel on on labels I've been thinking
about that a lot lately what exactly
what's the most accurate way
to describe where I fall if I had to
give a quick you know just one flat
label and then of course there's the
democratic socialism issue which is you
guys are well familiar with it we've
we've spoken about it quite a bit on the
show lately Bernie Sanders kind of
[ __ ] it all up now didn't he he really
did he went out there and he called
himself a Democratic Socialist when you
actually look at Bernie's positions he's
not a Democratic Socialist he's not a
traditional Democratic Socialist he
doesn't believe in a post-capitalist
philosophy he believes in the Nordic
system the Scandinavian system he's a
standard Social Democrat but since he
described himself as a Democratic
Socialist what happened is a lot of
other people started doing that too and
now she's too far gone now Democratic
Socialist means traditional Democratic
Socialist and also Social Democrat so
and and I understand that and I accept
that I understand that there's no way
that I alone or myself and like three
other people can fight back against this
giant wave like that train already left
the station it's over on that front but
it is kind of a shame it is kind of a
shame I mean don't get me wrong I think
the right people on the far right would
smear us anyway but I think it did make
it easier for them to smear us because
now you have you know all this
conflation with well I guess you believe
in Venezuela I guess you believe in
whatever the Soviet Union I guess you
believe in Cuba because the actual
textbook definition for democratic
socialism if somebody is a traditional
democratic socialist it actually is a
socialist philosophy it's a
post-capitalist philosophy and so it
makes it easy for people on the right to
act like you are totally outside of the
mainstream and you're totally beyond the
opinions of the American people and you
are genuinely radical and so it's easy
for them to smear people on the left
like oh all of you are post capitalists
simply because Bernie adopted a label
democratic socialist that is
traditionally post capitalist even
though he's not post capitalist so it's
um that's an
is not going to be resolved the only
thing that drives me nuts though and I
have to say this is that people have
nowt on the right have have taken this
and used it as in opportunity to smear
the [ __ ] out of people who are just
Social Democrats you know and the only
way to fight back against that is to
accurately point out that no you're
wrong in in saying that this particular
person even though they described
himself as a Democratic Socialist has a
post-capitalist philosophy yeah and
again this gets back to the whole issue
with labels to begin with that's why
it's more important to listen to exactly
what people say on the issues than
anything else you know and that's why
labels can be misleading because
somebody could call himself like I
brought this fact up a million times but
did you know Bernie Sanders during the
primary he actually beat Hillary Clinton
among self-described conservative
Democrats now you're probably thinking
that's the most ridiculous thing I've
ever heard Hillary is just a fact that
Hillary is more conservative than Bernie
that's right it is a fact Hillary's more
conservative than Bernie
so then how did Bernie win among more
conservative Democrats because people
don't know dick about labels they call
themselves conservative but then when
you go through the issues they turn out
to be pretty far left or populist left
and so that that's one of those things
men like I when you ask the American
people most American has described
themselves as moderately conservative
but then when you go issue for issue you
find out that they're actually not even
so CNN has been doing multiple stories
about Infowars
and their implication continues to be
that they should be banned from you know
their respective platforms that they're
on so let's take a look here this is
brian Stelter on reliable sources let's
watch and then we'll discuss say they
are working hard every day to stop the
spread of misinformation and they say
they want to help people find reliable
sources so here we go one day this week
I was at a press event at YouTube all
about this and the next day CNN's Oliver
Dorsey was in a Facebook event about
this so he asked a simple question how
can Facebook be serious about fighting
misinformation and still that Infowars
have a page with nearly 1 million
followers here to tell us what happened
next is CNN senior media reporter Oliver
Darcy let's talk about why Facebook
reacted the way it did you asked this
question at a press event here's a part
of Facebook's answer in this kind of
formal statement they issued later they
say look we see pages on our site
they're on both the left and the right
pumping out what they consider opinion
or analysis but which others call fake
news we believe banning these pages
would be contrary to the basic
principles of free speech so what do we
do instead we demote individual posts
that are reported by Facebook users and
rated as false by fact checkers so
that's the Facebook explanation why does
it not hold water right well I went to
this press event where they aim to tout
their fight against misinformation and
conspiracy theories online and after the
presentation I asked a very simple
question how can you host Infowars
and then sit there and tell us that you
take misinformation online of you
seriously and at the time the Facebook
executives didn't really have a good
answer but the answer from base was
pretty clear they say we demote those BS
stories so fewer people see them that is
action right it is action and that's
Facebook's arguments I think a lot of
people are saying maybe that's not
enough action why would you poison a
hundred people with false information if
you're acknowledging that it's not good
information it's it's not good enough
for our large audience so why would it
be good enough for a small audience and
I think that is going to be a question
that Facebook's going to have to answer
going forward yes so the company's
response it says you know
these sites might be opinion or analysis
I think the reason why this offended too
many people is because they're
suggesting it's an opinion you know it's
an acceptable opinion right that for
example the Sandy Hook massacre was a
hoax and it's classified on their
website as a news and media website and
Facebook's basically saying different
publishers have different points of view
I think this is not really a case of a
different point of view a left or right
it's really a matter of right and wrong
right and Facebook could come down and
say this is you know poisoning the well
this is bad information we're not gonna
host this this kind of content on our
platform Facebook's instead saying that
we're gonna be not removing content
that's false and kind of interesting
from the company that says it's doing a
lot to fight misinformation online and
this is not just an issue for Facebook
it's an issue for Twitter for YouTube
for other tech platforms as well boat
wars pops up on all of them right info
us has a YouTube channel they have a
Twitter page Alex Jones is non-stop
tweeting and live-streaming using
periscope which is a twitter product and
so it does really beg the question do
these tech giants have a responsibility
to stem misinformation online and if it
does does it stop what Jones or does it
also go transfer to other outlets that's
partly why this gets so complicated
though right Facebook and other tech
giant's do not want to be in the
business of deciding what's true or
what's false right they would much
rather with the algorithms just you know
demote really ugly content I think that
not have to make decision yeah I think
that's why Facebook does not really want
to take a position on this they don't
want to ban them outright because
they're afraid that that's gonna be seen
as censorship against conservatives and
particularly the pro shop media house
Jones is gonna hear this he's gonna say
why is CNN out to get me why are you
trying to take me down right reaction
III my reaction is I was asking a very
simple question at a Facebook event
where they said that they are stemming
misinformation online that they're very
serious about combating misinformation
conspiracy theories and and fake news
and so I think the obvious question is
how can you host the leading purveyor of
conspiracy theories online while
claiming simultaneously that you're
serious about fighting fake news on your
platform that's the question so there
are a few things to point out here the
most important one is okay you
Alex Jones promoting fake news well
without a doubt yes I mean there's no
question about that we cover him all the
time and virtually all my commentary is
like okay that's actually wrong that's
factually wrong that's stupid that's
stupid and I stand by my record on all
of my segments debunking Alex Jones
so does he promote fake news without a
doubt but I have I take issue with the
whole premise of their conversation
which is like oh you have to have there
something has to be done it has to be
done it has to be done now I get it
they're saying well no that's the claim
that Facebook is making Facebook is
saying oh we're doing so much to fight
fake news and and you know the response
from CNN has been like oh really you
have Infowars on there so you're
obviously not doing that much but there
is an implication with what the CNN
hosts are saying there which is you
should really not kick them off your
platform now if anybody is justified in
you know having a some sort of vendetta
against Infowars its brian Stelter
because alex jones has gone on these
really weird creepy rants against brian
Stelter that actually have scared the
[ __ ] out of me and made me feel like you
know jones needs medication
like it would that bad you can go back
and check those out type in secular talk
alex jones brian Stelter - you know the
search box if you want to see my
commentary on that and see the video of
jones flipping out but so I get Brian
Celgene why he'd be against Alex Jones
and why he'd you know want to talk about
this stuff but at the same time I don't
for the life of me I don't understand
how they don't realize how terrible a
precedent that would be so let's say you
kick Alex Jones off of Facebook off of
Twitter off of YouTube okay well I've
already seen articles from CNN
nonetheless that link alongside Alex
Jones jimmy dore they said oh my god
here's this conspiracy theorist on the
left named jimmy dore and the reason
he's a conspiracy theorist is because he
spoke about how the evidence for assad
using sarin gas against his own people
is non-existent and the u.s. bombed
before there was even an investigation
okay we'll see when Jimmy says that
that's what we call factually accurate
just because CNN and mainstream media is
parroting the narrative that came
directly out of the Defense Department
doesn't mean that they are factually
correct and Jimmy is wrong in fact Jimmy
was 100% factually right and he was
included in an article alongside Alex
Jones and literal neo-nazis about fake
news on YouTube so you see the problem
here they're okay if you start uh you
know kicking people off of the platform
and banning them and censoring them well
it all starts with well I do it with the
worst well just the [ __ ] really
hateful [ __ ] okay get rid of that
well then it becomes he-said she-said
game of well now some people say jimmy
dore is a terrible conspiracy theorist
well you know people on the Left can
keep pointing at people on the right
like steven crowder and ben shapiro and
saying hey listen man it's not that
they're just giving opinions they are
factually wrong about a lot of the stuff
they talk about like for example when it
comes to taxes when it comes to foreign
policy you there are demonstrable proven
falsehoods that those guys pew so okay
that is by definition fake news it's
untrue stuff that they keep reporting
should they go so the left is gonna
point to the right and say they gotta go
the right is gonna point to the left you
think a Ted Cruz voter is not gonna
point at this show and say oh my god
he's terrible he's doing fake news look
at how disparaging he is of
conservatives and of fundamentalist
evangelicals so everybody is offended by
something everybody's gonna say
something's hate speech when it's not
hate speech everybody's gonna say
something untrue when it's not or maybe
it is but that's the point either you go
down this path and set the precedent of
banning people or you just draw one
clean line and say you know what it's
all allowed I'm in the camp of it's all
allowed now if you want to say hey man
no door
threats of violence you're kicked off if
that happens if you dock somebody you're
gone you know in that case sure yeah
there of course there can be rules but
the question is do you want to lean
toward the side of free speech or do you
want to lean toward the side of we're
gonna be the the mother patrolling the
internet and trying to protect the
public from things that we deem unworthy
of them to see but the problem is who
the [ __ ] would trust Silicon Valley
oligarchs to be objective in this
decision-making and the answer is nobody
should I mean there are gonna be some
people who trust it but they're just
wrong to trust it I mean god damn it CNN
is begging for more censorship here guys
CNN they were the people along with the
rest of the mainstream media who did all
of the fake news on the lead up to the
Iraq war you know there are a lot of
people out there who CNN would accuse of
doing fake news that never did fake news
that led to a literal invasion of
another country that killed hundreds of
thousands of innocent people the
mainstream media referred to torture as
enhanced interrogation because the Bush
administration told them to now it was
really torture but they called it
enhanced interrogation why because they
were doing fake news to do propaganda
for the government so they could still
have access to that government when they
wanted it so what happens when CNN does
fake news what happens joy-ann Reid just
did a thing the other week you know we
spoke about her on this show she lied
about not making blog post that she
definitely made so that's fake news
should Joanne Reid not be allowed on on
YouTube or Facebook or any of these
social media platforms I mean if they're
being objective and how they enforce
their rules the answer is yes we've
spoken about this in the context of
Donald Trump Donald Trump has quite
literally violated Twitter's vague ass
rules on hate speech talking about you
know when he was threatening North Korea
to bomb North Korea going months back on
Twitter you know threatening violence
there's one example the disparaging
things things he said about Muslims is
another
example so he's violated Twitter's Terms
of Service should he be banned no see
the point is guys you should lean
heavily towards the side of freedom of
speech only in the clearest cases
imaginable should you be able to you
know kick somebody off or do something
like that but don't trust Silicon Valley
oligarchs they're not gonna be objective
and how they enforce these things what
they're gonna do is have a very Pro
establishment media bias which is why
CNN does this segment by the way because
they know that no matter what they're
always going to be the last man standing
because they're the most trusted name in
news so even though they do terrible
[ __ ] fake news [ __ ] all the time
but oh where where were the most trusted
name in news because we're coasting off
our legacy and off that [ __ ] slogan
so we escape any censorship crackdown
which means that they're gonna cheer
lead Center ship all day because they
actually have a financial incentive to
do so
because they know it eliminates the
competition and see that's my point in
this segment is you know CNN you guys if
you really wanted to you could do a
giant expose on Alex Jones you have the
resources you have the money you have
the manpower you know this little
rinky-dink show here we'd debunk Alex
Jones on a weekly basis I've converted
more people away from Alex Jones than
CNN ever will you know they're
cheerleading for his censorship
I don't cheerlead for his censorship I
say he should have the right to speak
and I'm gonna bust up the stupid
[ __ ] you say cuz it's exactly that
stupid [ __ ] but instead of engaging
and destroying and logically breaking
down instead of debunking him what they
do is they try to draw clean lines
around the conversation and say no
you're just outside of that conversation
and we're not gonna allow you in the
conversation but that's not gonna
convince people if anything that puts
him in this corner as ooh he's the edgy
outsider you just defined him as the
edgy outsider which could attract more
people to his nonsense so this would set
a terrible precedent who the [ __ ] would
the fact-checkers even be who's gonna
fact-check the fact checkers you know
it's all that's gonna happen is legacy
media gets a competitive advantage over
all independent outlets and it would
never be enforced objectively because
when CNN does fake news when Fox News
does fake news when MSNBC does fake news
there's no punishment
there's only punishment if you're
independent if you're smaller and a
price I'm willing to pay to have a free
and open system is allowing the fringe
lunatics like Alex Jones to also have a
voice now again I'm in favor of fighting
back against them
so yes argue debunk show demonstrate
stuff prove it to a logical breakdown
show the evidence show where he's wrong
and that's how you win you know you
don't you don't just declare that
they're there outside of the realm of
debate they are literally not in the
sense that he has like three million
[ __ ] listeners so even though you
want to pretend like he's outside of the
but he's literally not outside of the
debate he's not he's not he's not he's
just not so for you to say is we're
gonna act like we're gonna do platform
him but why is he's in the debate he has
the followers instead of addressing what
he's saying you're just like that's it
no he's outside of the debate see the
thing is when CNN begs for or implies
that Alex Jones should should be banned
it somehow makes them look more petty
than Alex Jones which is like
unbelievably stupid because he's such a
menace and he's so bad and he's so full
of [ __ ] but when you do [ __ ] like this
he just capitalizes on it
now oh my god I'm the victim oh my god
I'm the edgy outsider truth teller which
is why they're trying to censor me and
they're calling for me to be banned I'm
not calling for them to be banned so Wow
look at that I must be right so it's you
just got to stop it [ __ ] you they
think they're doing like good work
you're not doing good work and it
strikes me the thing that annoys me more
than anything is that it strikes me like
they genuinely haven't thought through
this like they really haven't thought
okay what precedent does this set if we
get rid of Infowars what precedent is
that
who else would it affect and by the way
I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say
I don't even agree with the demoting of
the stories I don't even agree with that
because again guess who gets swept up in
those algorithms and gets pushed to the
bottom me Jimmy Dore TYT all these other
outlets then most people probably
wouldn't want swept to the bottom if
they knew what we were saying they knew
was accurate but oh no the way Kyle
talks and the specific topics he covers
you can't talk about Saudi Arabia and
permanent Israeli Apartheid and get your
story promoted or not get your story
tampered down you're talking about taboo
subjects so we will just lump that into
the fake news category Oh Kyle you did a
segment where you covered
charlottesville neo-nazis but since
neo-nazi is in the title of your video
we're scared its actual neo-nazi content
so we're gonna de prioritize it and
demote it that's how these algorithms
work they're not specific they're not
nuanced they're not doing the job they
were designed to do or supposedly
designed to do they are hurting
independent content creators so even the
idea of like oh we're doing a good thing
we are demoting content that we say is
fake news but you don't even know what
the [ __ ] fake news is you don't you
don't these from the same people who
thought it was [ __ ] when we got the
WikiLeaks information about the DNC
about the DNC break in the primaries the
same people who refused to cover that
are gonna tell us what fake news is know
that news was accurate you just didn't
like it so you didn't cover it so it's
annoying it's annoying we're not
fighting a fair fight here it's people
with all the money and all the power and
all the control versus independent
content creators and it's it's upsetting
is what it is to say the least
awakening from his burger coma oh the
two different like ends of the spectrum
of being hungry and wanting fast food
and like being super hungry and then
when you eat all the food afterwards
just being dead
you hassle burgers yeah a ten-week so I
usually get there's like a number one or
something like that it's like four
burgers and it comes with fries and a
drink
but at White Castle their fries are so
small so I usually get that and then
I'll add on like three birth so um this
time I think it was like number seven
was ten burgers two drinks and two fries
I got that [ __ ] that's a brilliant
that's a brilliant move now would have
gotten that ten burgers they're small
though the thing that makes you feel
feel bad about myself is the two drinks
like I don't mind the two fries the two
drinks when they hand you two drinks and
you're by yourself that's a bad feeling
really so why why they drink though that
make you feel bad as opposed doesn't
it's like why do I need two drinks and
that makes me feel like this should be
for two people like two fries isn't bad
cuz it's small enough to realize like
alright I can eat both these fries had
ten burgers yeah but but two drinks like
she hands me two drinks and I'm the only
person in the car she's like this [ __ ]
all for you
it's like yet don't feel bad cuz I just
ate like you ate shitty but at least you
had a meal I just had it's the neon neon
sour neon crawlers do you know saying
those are the hood ones the good ones
are those I CVS brand that's pretty yeah
I mean it's [ __ ] sour candy of course
it's it's gonna be good doesn't matter
like who makes it and then I had this
which is like the most budget excuse
ever to be like it's like a sad excuse
and attempt to be healthy but it's not
even close to being healthy they're
called protein chips oh I've had those
before no so here's the thing if you
hear them - regular chips there
rendus yeah they're like terrible but if
like let's say you're on a desert island
and regular chips don't exist and then
somebody hands you this [ __ ] you're
gonna eat this [ __ ] and you're gonna
love it if I'm on a desert island and
somebody hands me like dog [ __ ] chips
I'm gonna eat that [ __ ] and love it like
I'm happy to be eating whatever if I'm
on a stranded Island you know what I
would compare this to I would compare
this to when I quit when I quit
cigarettes and I started having the east
cigarettes that just have nicotine in it
but don't have any of the cancer-causing
[ __ ] and like I always said it wasn't
like a perfect fix where you would
totally get rid of the craving but you
could cut the craving down like 60%
which was all that little nudge that you
needed to get by and not have a
cigarette yeah that's how I feel about
these compared to regular chips it's
like yeah if you really want chips and
you're like I really want to have
[ __ ] chips you eat these and you're
like all right like I don't want want
chips anymore obviously chips are better
but this was enough to scratch the itch
enough where I'm good
I've I've had those I feel like the
protein starts to hit you a little bit
too much but to the cigarette point I
never understood like my step-brother
used to smoke cigarettes and then when
he was weaning off I'm like he would be
like all I need is just like a toothpick
and I'll be good and I'll be like that's
all you need like to like stop you from
having that urge for a cigarette it's
just to have a toothpick in your mouth
maybe like yeah that'll hold me over
well some of its Asian yeah that's what
I'm saying yeah that's some sample
that's a huge part of it for other
people it's the social triggers so like
if you're working at a place and you've
smoked for three years and then you try
to quit but still work at that same
place well no there's gonna like at
twelve o'clock when you have your coffee
break usually you and Dave like go to
the water cooler and then you go hey you
wanna go grab cigarette man let's go
grab a cigarette you're so used to that
routine and there's all the social
triggers there that it's harder for that
guy to quit than somebody who starts a
new job and says I'm gonna not smoke
anymore because you don't have any of
the social triggers anymore that make
you like oh now's my time to go smoke a
cigarette
ya know cigarette smoking to me is just
so weird so I was just in California and
don't think anyone in San Diego has
gotten the message or memo that like
we're not smoking cigarettes anymore
really there's a lot of smoke so many
people like when I go downtown Chicago
or even in New York I rarely see people
smoking cigarettes anymore like it's
like it's not as common as I used to see
like you would go a lot of places um and
I know for restaurants sake they ban
that and restaurants yeah like it used
to be a thing when you'd go to the
restaurant it would just be commonplace
to like you're not smoking yep exactly
um even at hotels like this airplane
smoke on airplanes
yeah that's wild - [ __ ] yeah yeah that's
wild but yeah San Diego was like a lot
of people were still smoking cigarettes
and one to me I just never understood it
I never I think I tried smoking once
like whatever really smoke ever but I
just never like it's just like it's just
a weird concept to me that like you get
up from your meal walk outside the
restaurant and stand there and have a
cigarette like it's really like those
commercials that it's like a little
cigarette is controlling your whole life
you know it's like fascinating I think
it has a lot to do with almost like this
counterculture rebel thing where it's
like you wanna put like a middle finger
up to society and be like you'll [ __ ]
your rules and what do they tell you
they're like you shouldn't smoke cause
it's really bad for you and then people
who do it are the kind of people who are
like oh yeah I shouldn't smoke watch
this and then they smoke and it's like
they think it's on some rebellious [ __ ]
but you're right that really it's it's
the opposite it's like after a while it
controls you you don't control it you
know like you're beholden to it and
you're you're destroying your health and
you're wasting a tremendous amount of
money I mean my dad smoked two packs a
day men and then like think about if you
put on a kitchen table none of the money
he wasted on cigarettes he for his life
he probably started smoking I don't know
how old he was maybe 23 and he smoked
his whole life so put all two packs a
day all that time that's a shitload of
money just chilling at the table yeah so
yeah it's one of those things where I
used to smoke so I get it more than
other people for me it started out like
well my dad smoked so bad role model but
also
like trying to be cool thing like oh I
want to smoke so you don't like it the
first like four packs but then by the
time you get to the fifth pack you're
like damn I kind of want to smoke a
cigarette and then though it's just a
matter of you're hooked until you can
decide I'm gonna get off of it but the
thing is they say it's harder to kick
than heroin I don't buy that at all I
was able to quit
I was yeah and I don't I don't crave it
at all anymore it's not even close to a
craving its it like the thought of
having a cigarette now is not something
that's appealing to me I mean that might
stick with you for a year or so but it
once it's gone it's gone and I think
Aaron that's something different people
oh yeah I mean I don't know what what
the heroin fixation is like but like I
sort of compare it or to like when
people are like oh man it's addicting
and this and that and I'll never know
what it's like to be addicted to
cigarette smoke but I sort of compare it
to when I go on my food like eating
binges and it's like I'm just eating on
healthy format long I feel like I've
always been the type to just be like
boom [ __ ] this tomorrow I'm meeting
healthy and that's it you know it
sometimes it's hard sometimes I meet in
like 10 White Castle burgers and then
like [ __ ] McDonald's and Wendy's the
next day but I feel like I always have
that like mental capacity to be like I'm
Odeon right now like tomorrow I'm going
on my [ __ ] that like if I was ever a
cigarette smoker to be like why am I
doing this like no I'm stopping cold
turkey tomorrow yeah George Carlin had a
the comedian George Carlin says
something really smart about like drug
use in general including cigarettes and
alcohol and all that stuff he said at
some point the intellect will override
the will to want to keep doing the thing
and I think that's true I think that
once you actually make the decision
you're gonna be fine like you're gonna
do it it's just people who are caught in
that middle ground who are like I kind
of want to do it but I don't really want
to do it but those are the people who
are gonna struggle and who are gonna
keep going back and then so it really
just comes down to a matter of have you
actually gotten to that point where you
want to stop the thing because if you
have gotten to that point that you want
to stop the thing you're gonna stop it
but if you're on the fence or if you're
leaning slightly in the direction of I'm
not sure I want to stop I know it's the
right thing then you're not gonna stop
so it is just a mad
of commitment to a large extent I mean
don't get me wrong some people with
certain substances they'll get to a
point where they need professional help
and I recommend that go get professional
help if you need it for something like
cigarettes no I think that once you get
over that hump whatever it might be that
first week or first year and you know
you could even give yourself a crutch
that's the thing about cigarettes that's
easier is it really is true that there
are things that help you whether it's
the nicotine patch or the nicotine gum
or the my candy cigarettes like that
will help somebody and that's one of the
reasons I hate like you know how people
were trying to lump in the e-cigarettes
with regular cigarettes and act like
they're just as bad
like ireally is bad though they they
might be bad but it is like logically
impossible for them to be as bad as
cigarettes because cigarettes have like
over 900 chemicals and some of them are
known to cause cancer whereas you only
have like vapor and nicotine like
flavored vapor and nicotine in the east
of yoga vape pens and all that [ __ ] so
that's the thing let's say first let's
say for what we learned that it's bad
okay well there's like [ __ ] at least
200 different chemicals and cigarettes
that are bad so you have one chemical
and these cigarettes that are bad and
you think that's now it's equal that's
not equal I'm close to equal so even if
there are negative health effects to
vaping
it's just significantly less than
[ __ ] it's like saying always caffeine
bad well yeah if you have too much
caffeine okay is it equal to cocaine no
it's not like this is not the same thing
so it's just another level of douchiness
with vaping like we also in San Diego I
saw like someone vaping he did his vape
and then blew it out and like this whole
cloud of like his [ __ ] thing do it
cross the street he literally did it on
one side of the street and the whole
cloud went up and like went across the
street and I was just like that guy is
such a [ __ ] loser like why what's the
point of doing that so like I just I
mean I've never vaped I just don't get
it like like have a piece of gum or some
[ __ ] do you really need to blow that
whole [ __ ] dust cloud into the
[ __ ] air I'm grumpy
well some people some people say the
opposite of
I was saying which is oh no it's used as
a gateway to smoking cigarette so in
other words teams will be introduced to
like some delicious cherry soda flavor
vapor yeah and then eventually they're
smoking you know Newports on a Sunday
that yeah well that's my point is it
worked the opposite with me where I went
from cigarettes to the to vaping nothing
you know so I just think it's a better
product than than cigarettes and I don't
like that they're trying to treat it
exactly like it's cigarettes yeah it
just strikes me as like the government
trying to do too much and be like the
nanny state and try to be like no no
we're gonna tell you what's right and
what's wrong and this is not okay it's
like yeah you're talking about do you
yeah you know they don't know basic [ __ ]
it's like when they did the crackdown on
kratom and then at least these reports
and they're like it is an opiate it's
like well no not really it might affect
the same receptors but it doesn't have
the same effects as that so it's really
misleading to say that and then they
list like oh all these overdoses from it
and then you read the cases and it's
like somebody was was high and drunk on
like nine different drugs and they're
just blaming the kratom and it's like oh
you guys just don't know what the [ __ ]
you're talking about it's like you're
trying to come to these conclusions but
you just don't know what the [ __ ] you're
talking about and you didn't even bother
to like talk to experts or people who
are you in using it and have a lot of
anecdotal experience you know it's just
they're just [ __ ] making [ __ ] up it's
just weird I mean seeing people that are
so broke or like homeless people or
people that don't have that much money
spending twelve dollars on a pack of
cigarettes and like you said sometimes
people smoke twice two packs a day it's
like I like I spent that number seven at
White Castle was like fourteen dollars I
can't imagine doing yeah fourteen
dollars hard to spend fourteen dollars
at a fast food joint I know I know I was
a little shocked that it was fourteen
dollars and I was a little like upset at
myself not for eating all the food but
you spend in the fourteen dollars what
so what's the limit at a fast food place
before you go whoa
I think $14 is important it was like
yeah I was gonna say like ten like ten
once you hit ten at a fast food place
it's like what am I doing here
I would say 11 yeah 11 to 14 I don't
think I'm gonna do that again 14 I'm
gonna go back to my like number one [ __ ]
which is like nine which is still a
little diesel didn't McDonald's bring
back the dollar menu Dave always had it
I think they like cha dad went away with
it for a minute oh did that they did
yeah he's got like a dollar menu thing
and then they have a two dollar menu
thing now and then they have a three
dollar menu thing which is just like
they have certain menus for $1 $2 $3 and
one of them is like just two chicken
strips that should just be like 12 cents
no but I think it's on like the I think
that's on like the $3 menu because
they're like damn buttery crispy it's
like a difference oh it's like a
delicious one yeah okay
there was McDonald's got in trouble cuz
like I think their salads where there
was something poisonous or some recall
in their salad or some [ __ ] so they're
like we're just gonna stop serving
salads now well everyone everybody's
probably like finally you're [ __ ]
doing that you're your McDonald's like
you can't like you can't do that it's
like a health food place selling whiskey
or [ __ ] yeah I've always been a dollar
menu devotee like I'm a dollar menu kind
of guy yeah but we've always spent so
much money on the dollar menu that like
we could have been better off maybe
buying something else but then next you
know because yeah get a variety of [ __ ]
off the dollar menu what I used to crush
when I was like let's probably like 19 I
used to go to McDonald's go to the
dollar menu and I could crush like two
cheeseburgers to make chickens large
fries and two apple pies I could just
how salwar would it be on the dollar
menu because they'd think I would I
would just be like yeah I don't want
small I want large they even did value
fries I feel like even it feels like
like 40 cents more some [ __ ] I'd be like
Matt I got a stick to the dollar thing I
respect that though cuz that's real
dollar menu loyalty yeah that's like I'm
going with that because it's right there
on the dollar menu whereas I was just in
fat ass mode and I was like because I
would eat it wouldn't matter what I ate
I just wouldn't gain the weight like it
would I could eat anything I just watch
it wouldn't gain weight that's how I was
I just wouldn't
no matter what now that there's a
certain there's a certain age I don't
know if it's an age or like just it just
happens but you'll start gaining weight
oh yeah of course I mean obviously I had
already hit that point at some point but
yeah I'm saying when I was 19
whatever we want literally anything I
could eat all day every day and I
wouldn't gain weight it was crazy same
yeah so I was a legendary eater me me
and and my friend Bobby you know this
core did you ever do with us we called
it the tour well I've heard of it I
never did it you heard it that's so
funny it's like we would be like God
wouldn't what's the [ __ ] in sports when
you win every every the Grand Slam the
Grand Slam even bigger than that and we
called it the tour what we would do is
and this is how much of a fat ass I was
and this is how terrible my health
probably is we would go to every single
fast-food place and get one thing from
each fast-food place and let's see the
ones in the area so obviously we don't
have like every fast-food place in our
area but we go to all the ones that were
within reason so we go to KFC get a now
we get is the I think it's called the
snacker like the chicken sandwich yeah
McDonald's I forgot what I got from
McDonald's it was either a cheeseburger
it was ruas fries mm-hmm Taco Bell this
is all in the same Patrol like all in
the same name google maps like you're
added stops and so I got a gordita
Bernie and Burger King I know there was
one more I'm not sure if it was Burger
King or not it was probably Wendy's yeah
I was gonna say maybe whammies Wendy's I
think I may have gotten to junior bacon
cheeseburger from Wendy's and the fries
from McDonald's oh and I just saw em and
then you eat sit there and you eat it
all and then we'll do weight or you'll
eat your McDonald's on the way to church
you're not allowed to eat it as you keep
going and that's about me you can think
that was like I can't trust anyone who's
not eating out of the [ __ ] bag before
they leave the drive-through that's what
I was gonna say too is I'm I've always
been the kind of person where as I'm
pulling up to the the window I'm like
I'm gonna wait and eat this at home and
then the second it's in my car I start
eating it
it's impossible it's impossible it's
impossible to not it's just a human
reaction that's almost like my cigarette
smoking I cannot I guess I can't not put
my hand in a bag well you smell it when
you smell the fries or the flippin
burgers
anyone gets their food like the bag from
the lady at the window and that [ __ ] has
fries chillin at the top of it or like
the taco wrappers starting to open a
little bit or some [ __ ] and you don't
reach into that bag before not even
before you leave did you like that no
special counsel robert muller charged 12
russian intelligence of officers with
hacking democrats during the 2016
election so this is from CNBC here their
bullet points are special counsel robert
muller has obtained a new indictment
charging 12 russian intelligence
officers with hacking democrats to
interfere with the 2016 presidential
election and with stealing information
of about 500,000 american voters the
Justice Department announced Friday the
indictment lodged by a federal grand
jury in Washington DC accuses the
Russian spies of hacking into the
Democratic National Committee and the
presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton
and of releasing emails obtained from
that cyber snooping with a goal of
influencing the election President
Donald Trump who has repeatedly called
Muller's probe a witch-hunt was briefed
on the case earlier in the week and that
the president is fully aware of today's
actions by the department said Deputy
Attorney General rod Rosenstein okay so
here's what they say the indictment
lodged by a federal grand jury in
Washington DC accuses the Russian spies
of hacking into the Democratic National
Committee and the presidential campaign
of former Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton and of releasing emails obtained
from that cyber snooping with the goal
of influencing the election more than
300 people associated with the DNC and
the Clinton campaign were targeted the
indictment charges two of the defendants
are also charged with conspiring to
infiltrate computers of organizations
responsible for administering elections
including state board of elections
secretaries of state and companies that
supply software and other technology
used to administer elections said Deputy
Attorney General Rod Rosenstein it was
the hacking of a state election board
that led to the theft of information
about the 500,000 voters he said
Rosenstein said that conspirators
created fictitious online personas
including DC leaks and gucci fir 2.0 and
used them to release thousands of stone
emails and other documents beginning in
June 2016 okay so apparently right after
Donald Trump did a press conference and
said in that press conference this is
now a very infamous moment Russia if
you're listening see if you can find her
30,000 emails so in other words he was
telling Russian intelligence officials
were just saying Russia in general
whatever it may have been hey see if you
can hack in to get Hillary Clinton's
missing emails very soon after that
there indeed was a hacking attempt and
they did hack the DNC and Hillary
Clinton's campaign now he lists mulher
list specific Russian intelligence
officials in the indictment and says
okay these are the people who are
responsible for that so what I don't
understand is this Muller keeps indicted
people that will never spend a day in a
US Court ever so he's indicted people
last time it was the troll farm people
now the indictments that in my opinion
are perfectly valid and legitimate for a
Muller are manna fort and Flynn and I
think there's a substantial amount of
evidence to talk about you know their
guilt whether it be for money laundering
or other charges so I think he's spot-on
and I totally back him when he goes
after Manta Ford Flynn I hope he's got
something cooking for Kushner and some
others but in terms of this move it
strikes me more like the troll farm of
because you're indicted Russian
intelligence officials for doing what
Russian intelligence officials are gonna
do now this does tell me one thing
though I was not sure whether or not it
really was Russia that did the hacking
because Julian Assange swore up and down
that it indeed was not Russia that his
source sources were other people not
affiliated with Russia and he said that
over and over and looking at
history of transparency and exposing
dark secrets that should be exposed I
tended to trust Julian Assange because
you know he hasn't lied to me before so
why would he lie to me now I think it's
very likely he wasn't telling the truth
now and I think it's very likely that
indeed it was Russian intelligence
officials who did the hacking and then
did get the DNC emails to WikiLeaks but
I think where I diverge from other
commentators on the left or I should say
Democratic Party commentators on this is
I still think it was a good thing that
we saw those those DNC leaks in fact I
think it's crazy if you disagree with
that because we learned about corruption
we learned about the primary effectively
being rigged against Bernie Sanders you
know we learned about Hillary Clinton
giving speeches and saying there's this
bigotry against the rich in the United
States and why are people so intolerant
against the rich and we should have
totally free and open trade borders
which would be like NAFTA and TPP on
steroids we learned about the funding
agreement that the DNC had with Hillary
Clinton where Hillary Clinton her
campaign was so in control the DNC that
they would get veto power over press
releases at the DNC so one of the - one
of the two campaigns that were down to
the wire in the Democratic primary was
in control of the DNC as they were
pretending to be neutral all along so
what's missing in this conversation now
because all the focus is on would you
look at that Russia is the one that did
the hacks and and gave us the DNC leaks
there's so much outrage over who did the
leaks that we're now no longer
discussing what was actually in the
leaks and whether or not they should
have been leaked in the first place so
and this is the same kind of thing that
happened with Edward Snowden you had the
establishment saying over and over like
oh my god he's a traitor treasonous can
you believe that he leaked these secrets
to the dnsa had and that our
intelligence agencies had unbelievable
and the estat while the establishment
was focusing on that regular people were
like
oh my god the NSA is spying on all of us
in collecting all of our metadata and we
definitely should see this
I don't care how we got this information
it is objectively a good thing that we
got this information I feel the same way
about the DNC leaks that it exposed
corruption and primary rigging and it's
so important to see it that I don't care
how we got it and here's the real litmus
test man so let's say let's pretend for
a second we live in this hypothetical
universe where Russia hacked the RNC and
they leaked information about the RNC
doing primary rigging against one of
their opponents and exposed rampant
corruption within the RNC would you
still flip out would you still say oh my
god we've been attacked and a lot of
people are calling this literally
terrorism would you say oh my god we've
been attacked by Russia this is
incredible this is terrible this is so
wrong how dare Russia leaked that
information on the RNC that exposes
corruption and primary rigging or would
you say if it was the RNC you know what
I don't care how we got that information
I'm happy we got that information
because we need to know that information
because in what's supposed to be a
democracy we're supposed to have
transparency and we're supposed to have
our elections on the up-and-up and be
totally free and fair and open and we
learned that as a matter of fact that
was not the case so for me I'm just
trying to be logically consistent
because in a situation like that I got
to be honest with you guys I would shrug
and I would go I don't care if it was a
Russian intelligence operatives I don't
care if it was [ __ ] Swedish
operatives people from Burundi or like
Trump said a 400 guy a 400-pound guy
sitting on his bed eating potato chips I
don't care how we got that information
we needed to see that information we
should have seen that information and I
can't it's hard for me to fathom that
anybody would seriously be
arguing no we shouldn't see that
information because Russia because of
how it was obtained I'm not okay with
seeing this information which obviously
you should want if you want to live in a
in a democracy and a free and fair and
open system so if it was the RNC I'd
kind of shrug and be like I don't know
why you guys keep focusing on who leaked
it as opposed to what's in the leaks so
now with the DNC I find myself in the
same boat that yes it overwhelmingly
likely was Russia that did the hacking
and gave the the DNC leaks and Hillary
Clinton stuff to WikiLeaks but I don't I
don't care I don't care I don't care I
don't care and I know that that's gonna
drive a lot of you guys crazy and I know
you're gonna think that that's like you
know an outrageous thing for somebody to
say but again I think those leaks were
so important and so necessary now where
I would criticize WikiLeaks for sure is
you should have been working day and
night to try to get leaks on the RNC as
well because it's not like I only
support transparency for one side it's
like oh only exposed the dirt on the DNC
and not on the RNC no you should be
exposing dirt on everybody who has a
position of power who wants a position
of power who are in the government and
we know listen I'm willing to bet you
that the RNC is equally as dirty as the
DNC if not even more so because that's
the general trend with elected
Republicans and Democrats anyway is that
the Democrats are really dirty and the
Republicans are usually even dirtier so
that's the one part of this that you
know I reserve criticism for WikiLeaks
and others is that if you're gonna do
transparency do it across the board do
it across the board and we have the
quotes from Julian Assange saying he
thinks it's you know better if the
Democrats lose this was back in the 2016
election Julian Assange like is better
the Democrats lose now admittedly I
think he was making that criticism from
a left perspective in the sense that you
know it's the old backlash argument all
the worst guy will win and then when the
worst guy wins the Left unites and then
we try to fight and overwhelm the bad
guys and then everybody will be united
against the bad guys if the Democrats
lose this time
so I think he had a weird kind of
backlash he argument there but and he
was biased he was biased in favor of the
Republicans but the one thing I would
want is no you have to leak on everybody
you can't you don't get to say like
you're above politics and then play
politics and only leak on the DNC
another important takeaway from this is
the collusion stuff of like Oh Donald
Trump specifically working with Russia
no I mean if that's the case he wouldn't
have had to announce the thing he wanted
them to do in a press conference because
he would have had a direct line to them
instead he was talking and shooting from
the hip and saying Russia go get Hillary
Clinton's deleted emails if you can
please believe me
unbelievable and then they did it so
would you need to have this you know
very open very public pronouncement of
that if you are like whoa haha working
behind the scenes with Russian
intelligence operatives no you just tell
them behind the scene it's like oh
here's what I want you to do and I
definitely don't want anybody to know
that I'm telling you this but here's
what I want you to know he said it in
public he said it in public so if that's
what the Democrats mean by collusion
that Donald Trump told Russia hey get
the email or release the emails and
release DNC information and he said it
publicly okay fine guilty guilty of
collusion there you go there's your
collusion but anything beyond that I'm
still unconvinced and again to me I'm a
policy guy so it always comes back to
policy for me and when you have Donald
Trump arming Ukrainian rebels who are
currently fighting Russia when you have
the us permanently militarily occupying
Syria as we're doing right now remember
serious one of Putin's top allies when
you have US warships in the Black Sea
right on Russia's border as we do right
now when you have increasing sanctions
as we've seen repeatedly from the White
House it's hard for me to look at that
oh and the other thing is he spent all
last week
ripping Germany because Germany has an
oil deal with Russia and he was trying
to blow up that oil deal so that the
u.s. gets that oil deal with Germany he
was
Germany's a puppet of Russia and the
reason he was saying that it wasn't
projection like no I'm the puppet of
Russia so now I'm going to include
accuse Germany of being the puppet of
Russia no he was accusing him of being a
puppet of Russia because that their oil
deal with Russia and Trump wants that
oil deal to come to the US so if you're
a puppet of that guy then why would you
try to blow up his business dealings and
benefit your own business dealings
because he's not a puppet of that guy
Trump is as corrupt as it gets
his the people around him are as corrupt
does it get we we have so many examples
of this whether it be money laundering
whether it be working together with
other governments Saudi Arabia Israel
but when it comes to Russia the policies
are simply not benefiting Russia so it's
hard to imagine him being a puppet of
Russia but yes I will say I do think
it's fair to say at this point that it
looks like the original DNC hacks were
done by Russian intelligence but again
my counter-argument to that is one I
don't care because we needed to see that
information and - you're gonna indict
Russian intelligence officials for doing
what you know Russian intelligence
officials are supposed to do that's like
Russia deciding we're gonna indict NSA
guys for spying on them or we're gonna
indict CIA guys for spying on them how
would we react to that here if Russia
decided where we're now announcing a
list of CIA operatives or NSA operatives
or both who have committed crimes
against us and tried to hack us we'd be
like yeah of course [ __ ] of course we
try to hack you that's what we do where
the NSA where the CIA you're a rogue
state a foreign entity of course that's
our whole point so it's the same thing
here I think and then the final point is
and people have been making it have been
pointing this out weird the three days
before Trump is scheduled to meet with
Putin and do this summit what happened
this leaks so this information leaks
which puts a tremendous amount of
pressure on Trump to be standoffish with
Putin because now all US media in unison
is screaming oh my god Russia hacked our
election
this was an attack on our democracy this
is literally terrorism this is the worst
thing ever and and Donald Trump was
scheduled to meet with Putin three days
later so you have three days straight of
the media screaming it Trump you got to
be hard on Putin you got to be tough on
Putin you got to make sure that you walk
away from it not with good relations and
that scares the [ __ ] out of me because I
want them to listen I want the US and
Russia to have good relations I really
do I really do I don't want permanent
escalation I don't want a military
standoff with another nuclear-armed
power so it is curious timing that you
release this three days before they meet
and now there's so much pressure on
Trump to be more standoffish with Putin
so anyway I kind of filed this new round
of indictments under the same category
as the troll farm which is I don't know
what you're doing here dude I don't
Robert Muller what are you doing
listen I'm telling you I agree with you
with manna fort I agree with you on
Flynn
I think Robert Muller is doing a
fantastic job going after the people in
Trump's administration who are guilty of
corruption and money laundering in a
thousand different crimes I think the
fact that he's looking into Trump's
business empire is a wonderful thing
because you're gonna find a lot of [ __ ]
there man so I agree with that 100% but
the Russian troll farm [ __ ]
you know indicted people over memes and
now indicted Russian intelligence
officials for doing what you know
Russian intelligence officials are gonna
do it's just weird and it's just goofy
and it blows my mind that this like how
quickly this convinces so many people of
the the most grandiose extreme narrative
of like no Trump is now a Manchurian
Candidate and we all know it like the
number of tweets I got where people
thought it was like oh I just pwned Keio
cuz I told him chump puppet to Russia
get some things that are happening in
the media keeps talking about it are you
even gonna bother to
look into the details in the specifics
and try to you know go through these
things with a fine-tooth comb and try to
be objective about it and and see what
parts are [ __ ] and what parts are
not [ __ ] and then remember this is
these are indictments not convictions
and di't mints the old saying is you can
indict a ham sandwich so are we really
gonna pretend like we should shut our
brains off and go with the most extreme
media narrative on this without really
parsing through it because I think
that's stupid and when I see a lot of
the tweets that are directed to me like
Oh what now Kyle yeah what what now is
exactly what I'm talking about now that
this is my take on it I've given you my
detailed take on it and I guarantee you
they're still gonna be a lot of people
who think like ah gosh you know Kyle
he's won't admit the thing with
Manchurian Candidate idiot alright well
we'll see we'll see how this all ends
we now have the mother of all Trump
Russia conspiracies to discuss this is
Jonathan Chait of New York magazine
apparently you say his name shade is
this guy here by the way dude
finasteride get on it
finasteride buddy I take it no shame in
that no shame in my game
his name is cheat not cheat I always
called him cheat I like chai eat better
coz it's like it sounds douchey and he's
douchey so John cheat went on Chris
Hayes a show to explain this goofy ass
conspiracy and I want you to pay close
attention and a matter of fact go ahead
pull up Microsoft Word or if you got a
sheet of paper next to you just [ __ ]
grab a pencil or pen and just jot down
look at the evidence that he's able to
share to back up his genius theory take
a look did the Trump campaign did the
candidate at the heart of it conspire
with Russia to subvert American
democracy or and does Russia has some
kind of leverage over Donald Trump in a
new cover story from New York magazine
writer Jonathan Chait argues we have not
allowed ourselves to consider the full
range of possibilities chant lays out
what could be considered the worst case
scenario for Trump Russia collusion the
Donald Trump has been a Russian
intelligence asset since 1987 New York
magazine Jonathan Chait joins me now so
ok it sounds insane I just want to say
it really does like the idea that he
went he goes to Moscow in 87 is
cultivated as a Russian intelligence
opposite asset and is this sort of like
sleeper cell for decades
sounds nuts it sounds like the stuff of
conspiracy theories why are you not
insane so that's a great question Chris
I get that all the time so first of all
the piece acknowledged is that that is
probably not true but it might be and
one of the reasons I wrote this is you
need to take seriously some of these low
probability high impact scenarios you
know before the election sort of
everyone heard that Hillary Clinton had
about an 80% chance of winning and we
all just treated it like that meant a
hundred percent and didn't think of
what would that 20% alternative really
mean so that's part of what I'm doing
with this with and with aspects of this
piece like this trip to Moscow you know
what would it mean if it was if it
really went that deep now there's a lot
of ways in which this scandal could be
really bad and not go that deep but I
think you need to consider that for
another reason which is that everyone
always says well this has been Trump's
view forever all this stuff he's saying
what the Western Allies splitting us
apart from the West and and how he's
sort of pissing on them all the time and
saying you know we should let them go
their own way that's just what he's
always thought it's not really what he's
always thought it's what he's thought
since 1987 he never thought that before
then at least he never said it before
then in 1987 is when he he went to
Moscow and he's feted by the Russians
and mentors Moscow and then he comes
back then he starts talk about running
for president for the first time and
then he starts talking for the first
time about how our allies a bunch of
freeloaders and we should kick him to
the curb yeah we should say that he is I
mean I just wanna be clear here he is
really consistent on that point right
that the idea that this sort of zero-sum
view that her allies are free-riding and
we're paying for it he takes out
full-page ads at $100,000 he sounds
identical to how he does now right the
idea that like we're getting abused
we're getting taken for granted and
we're paying for other people's defense
we're paying for the people's offense
who were defending against the Russians
right not particularly yes so it really
dovetails with Russian foreign policy
interests then and now now again that's
probably a coincidence and it might it
might not be I mean I think you know you
have to take seriously that possibility
that it's not a coincidence and you know
I try to assemble all the information
that I think can be brought to bear on
this question like I quote John Brennan
who was the CIA CIA director as recently
as 2016 who said that he thinks the
Russians have something over on Donald
Trump and and the weird thing is that
thinking like the CIA director hey maybe
he knows what he's talking about
that's the kook theory as we understand
it like The Kooks are the ones who
saying we should listen to the guy who's
running the CIA
usually the coups are saying the CIA is
part of the conspiracies and now it's
it's it's we Kooks are saying let's
listen well I wanna I want to
but never first there's there's one
piece here that I completely forgotten
about so I want to play Brennan's
testimony in May 2017 yeah that you cite
in the piece just to give people a
flavor of what how he talks about it
take a listen
I've studied Russian intelligence
activities over the years and have seen
it again manifested many different of
our counterintelligence cases and and
how they have been able to get people
including inside of CIA to become
treasonous and frequently individuals
who go along that treasonous path do not
even realize they're along that path
until it gets to be a bit too late and
you also were a reminder the piece of
that fact he got briefed in what was it
August for this in August 2016 the head
of British intelligence flies to the US
this is a report about a mayor to brief
him personally on what was going on
between the Trump campaign in Russia
yeah and in the Guardian had another
report about another Western European or
I think he may be a turn European
Intelligence Agency briefing him about
the same thing they were listening to
intercepts of Russian officials talking
about the Trump campaign in the
connections they had between them so we
don't know what those intercepts said
but but clearly he something you know
alarmed and said him often and in made
him reach these dire conclusions here
you know you have this metaphor the cave
right that we keep thinking that the
bottom is just right around the corner
maybe we're at the mouth of it right but
I've had this thought to it it's
vertigo-inducing thought I never know
quite where to orient ourselves and we
just know the facts as they kind of come
to light you kind of assemble them you
come up with a mental theory my question
you is are you confident we will know
the final truth right that like
ultimately the thing will be revealed
about what is true and what's not what
the facts of the matter are I think some
of the facts will find out I think the
things pertaining to the end of the
Trump campaign will probably find out
because a lot of people are flipping and
cooperating with Muller but if there's
leverage in Moscow my guess is that's
gonna stay in Moscow I don't see how
Muller is gonna get at secrets that are
locked at the Kremlin where do I begin
with this Jim okay so first of all let
me say up front because I can already
hear the echoes of straw Manning of me
happening on the Internet is Donald
Trump corrupt yes does he have business
deals with unsavory actors
unsavory actors from other countries and
around the globe yes
you know I've spoken about it before he
has a peace property hotel I think in
Panama where they were laundering drug
money
so is Donald Trump involved in some
shady [ __ ] yes there's evidence he's
done deals with the Mafia you know I
mean really you're gonna you're gonna be
a builder in New York City in the 1980s
and you don't have mob ties [ __ ] we
know as a matter of fact his lawyer when
he was younger I don't think to this day
cuz I think the guy may have passed away
but his lawyer when he was younger is
the same lawyer that was used by the top
mob families in New York
so yes Heath the dude certainly has mob
ties I don't think that's controversial
to say I don't think it's controversial
say that he's done deals with oligarchs
including Russian oligarchs I don't
think that's controversial how many
times have I gone off on the fact that
he has his products are made in 12
different countries so he has sweetheart
deals with different governments Saudi
Arabia gave him hundreds of thousands of
dollars when they stayed at his hotel
recently in a recent trip and in return
look at what they got oh wow shocker you
just got like a hundred billion dollar
weapons deal Israel same thing Jared
Kushner his son-in-law has taken a
tremendous amount of money from Israeli
banks millions and millions of dollars
and then Wow shocker
we end up doing the bidding of Israel
and moving the embassy to Jerusalem and
we they literally tried to prevent when
they were president when he was
president-elect they tried to prevent
the UN from condemning Israel over
illegal settlements this is when Israel
contacted Trump's campaign and said okay
listen this is what we want
you have Flynn Paul a Paul Manafort and
and Flynn Michael Flynn Flynn was doing
the bidding of the Turkish government he
was taking money he didn't register as a
foreign agent but he was taking money
from the Turkish government and he was
lobbying to not arm the Kurds in
Washington so he was doing the bidding
of a foreign government without even
registering as an agent of that foreign
government and he got nabbed and you
know Paul Manafort yes absolutely a
criminal I'm sure he was engaged in
money laundered
he's in [ __ ] prison right now so is
there are they a criminal family yes I'm
not saying they're not are they engaged
in corruption yes I'm not saying they're
not so I just want to be so clear about
that then nobody could try to strongman
a straw man me and say like my argument
is there didn't do anything wrong that's
not what I'm saying that's all I'm
saying what I am saying is this version
of events is hilariously stupid and a
parody of itself and I'll explain why I
just described how they're deeply
corrupt and they're doing the bidding of
other governments and their money
laundering and they're involved with
oligarchs and all that stuff
hundred percent the idea that it goes
all the way from Donald Trump to
Vladimir Putin and he's doing Putin's
bidding well that's probably not true
now why do I say that well for one thing
Putin one of Putin's top allies is Assad
in Syria we bombed him and hit and the
people on his side three times four
times
we're permanently occupying Syria right
now Trump announced that like about a
month or so ago and by the way nobody
even was talking about it but they're
like yeah we're gonna do permanent we're
gonna keep our troops in Syria what so
is that what is that what Booton wants
the United States to permanently occupy
his [ __ ] Ally who has got business
dealings with no Donald Trump approved
arms to go to Ukrainian rebels many of
those Ukrainian rebels have [ __ ]
neo-nazi ties and why would he send
money to Ukraine when Ukraine is
fighting Russia over the Crimea
situation you don't arm the side that's
fighting Russia if you're doing Vladimir
Putin's bidding that would never happen
he sanctioned them I know people like to
you know harp on certain sanctions Trump
not approving but he has increase
sanctions since he's been in office
that's a fact and then another
interesting piece of evidence that just
came out by the way Donald Trump like
all yesterday was ripping Germany on
Twitter why because we are we fund much
of NATO and at the same time there were
NATO Germany is getting a tremendous
amount of oil from Russia so Trump's
point is we'll hold on now let me see we
are paying for defense from Russia as
you [ __ ] have business dealings
with Russia and so he was lambasted them
and saying oh you're Russia's puppet now
people were like oh see he's trying to
do the he's doing projection because he
is obviously Putin's puppet no you
jackass he's bought by the oil companies
in the US he's bought by I mean he's
taken a tremendous amount of money from
ExxonMobil and all these different
fossil fuel companies and the reason why
he's ripping Germany for taking oil from
Russia for having business yields with
Russia is because that's him saying do
the business deal with us enrich the oil
companies that gave me money when I ran
for president so he's trying to blow up
a business deal that involves Russia
because he wants the u.s. he wants us
companies are really multinational but
he wants ExxonMobil and fossil fuel
companies here to get that deal so the
idea that like oh no he's just doing
projection no he's obviously trying to
blow up the business dealings he thinks
it's stupid that we pay for defense from
Russia as they have business deals with
Russia we need to defend you from your
[ __ ] business partner so it is all
the empirical evidence shows that even
though he's corrupt even though I'm sure
he's involved in money laundering in the
Mafia and all types of dirty [ __ ] and
he's doing the biddings of all these
different governments he's hasn't done
the bidding of Russia that's just a fact
okay now let's dig deeper here because
his art his argument it wasn't even an
argument it was a lack of an argument he
was like he starts by saying we all
thought Hillary would win okay and how
is that relevant to the conversation
then he says oh well he went to Moscow
so what he went to he went to Russia at
some point in his life I'm sure Trump
has been to at least 30 countries in his
life I'm sure of it
and then he said is my favorite piece of
non evidence well you know Trump he's
he's always kind of said that I guess
he's been critical of NATO I guess for a
long time
Shane argues he's only done that for
he's only been saying that for thirty
years
he's only been famous for thirty years
how the [ __ ] would you know what he was
saying before that he wasn't in the
public eye oh but what a ridiculous
argument to make then he says well you
know the CIA has concerns and they cite
Brennan as for backing them up that's
the dude who crafted the trone program
that's been murdering women and children
all over this world and now all the
sudden this guy who the left used to go
after viciously now all the time of he's
some sort of objective moral arbiter
that's just nonsense and then finally he
finishes by saying we'll never know you
know that
oh how [ __ ] convenient the Rania
Khalek made a great point on Twitter she
said this is now birtherism for
democrats that's what this is it's like
it's all the arguments are all non
arguments it's all innuendo it's all
assumptions it's all leaps of logic
we'll never know he finished it well if
you'll never well the [ __ ] you're
talking about it for what are you
talking about for this thing and they
even eat Chris Hayes is like this sounds
insane but let me give you air time for
you to go ahead and try to explain
yourself and even on the banner they
were like unlikely on the bag you're
gonna say unlikely but maybe do you have
any idea how many [ __ ] theories you
could throw out there with that
disclaimer unlikely but maybe unlikely
but maybe the moon landing was faked
unlikely but maybe the moon is made of
[ __ ] cheese unlikely but maybe a
Barack Obama's a Kenyan Muslim you God
there's it's become so disingenuous man
so insanely disingenuous and so let me
say this if to this point I haven't
convinced you fine I do want to show you
the big gotcha moment though of you know
what this theory is what this conspiracy
theory entails you want to see the very
simple not at all convoluted and not at
all stupid flow chart that Chaitra least
here to explain his conspiracy take a
look
this isn't a joke I didn't I didn't make
that shape made this as if to be like
anyway let me show you how how this
theory would work if indeed it was real
we're at Glenn Beck levels of crazy
that's what that is that's Glenn Beck
level crazy you with the giant
chalkboard this is Glenn Beck 2000-2010
nonsense
giant chalkboard draw the lines oh my
god Van Jones is a communist that's what
this is that's what this has become and
it's [ __ ] embarrassing and listen man
it's the more I see [ __ ] like this the
more I fear that Donald Trump can get
reelected he has a decent chance of
getting reelected because if this is
viewed as the predominant you know the
predominant narrative on the Left if
this is what we got then that's like you
know running on birtherism against Obama
and what happened was in the midterms in
2010 you had giant pickups from
Republicans okay so maybe 2018 Democrats
get major pickups but what happens in
2020 well what happened in 2012 Barack
Obama got reelected didn't he can Trump
get reelected keep saying stupid [ __ ]
like this and find out
hello mofos hi I got it I got a question
for you I'm gonna put on these glasses
and you're gonna tell me if I look like
a cop okay so if you start like beating
people if somebody a little bit yeah
where are those aviators so if I yeah
there are other aviators those are like
2001 Jersey Shore like extraordinary
bangers right there but do I look like a
cop yeah yeah you do
bang if you had if you threw a badge on
that shirt or like any type of hat on
it's a rap
back when I you'd be allowed to arrest
somebody back when I worked as a car
salesman mmm one of my customers just
randomly gave me like I think he worked
for the NYPD um forensic unit which
actually pretty cool like he gets to do
the crime scene that's like the law and
order like dead bodies and stuff right
yeah that's like the fingerprinting like
the DNA evidence like so he was doing
the the serious um like the serious
scientific [ __ ] yeah so he brought me an
NYPD it was almost like a golf shirt
yeah it had an NYPD logo and it said
forensics unit and then one day I put it
on and I looked in the mirror and I was
like damn I could definitely pass for a
cop oh for sure definitely would scare
the [ __ ] out of people if I'm walking
around like that they'd be like all this
[ __ ] gonna give me a ticket the
[ __ ] that gets me tight is when there's
cars that look identical to cop cars and
they even have like that well one you
could see in your rear-view mirror
sometimes like the headlights and you're
like I don't know if that's a cop or a
cab or just like a town yes or a [ __ ]
Chevy Impala from like 2009 yes Chevy
Impala yeah so like you start slowing
down and then you waste like five
minutes and the person comes up and just
some like old grandmother or some [ __ ]
or like some Spanish dude who's just got
like a Chevy Impala still like the rules
like they should have their own [ __ ]
like that's the only [ __ ] it's only made
for cops that [ __ ]
yes and they they have their own looking
lights and stuff like that where like
you know that those are cop lights yep
like cops it should it be some sneaky
[ __ ] to get a ticket like I shouldn't
see like driving on the highway and a
cop like hiding in some like camel [ __ ]
in between the lanes like if you're
gonna like get me speeding do it because
I was just speeding like don't don't be
on some like crazy trap [ __ ] cuz that's
[ __ ] up and be lenient where job as a
cop be lenient with it too like if
somebody's obviously driving at an
unsafe speed like yeah and pull that
[ __ ] over but if somebody's
one-five like hand over yeah well I'd be
I'd be mad about that [ __ ] too but the
[ __ ] that gets me tight is when I'm
driving on the highway and I like look
back and I'll see them in some obscure
place that like a cop shouldn't be like
you could see that now yeah yeah yeah
yeah car that [ __ ] out now like yeah
like that's [ __ ] up like when you're
like when they say that cops keep
tickets at the end of the month or
whatever to hit their quota and then you
ask a cop who's like the cool cop in the
neighborhood you're like you guys do you
guys do that [ __ ] he's like now it's not
true that's true yes they do that [ __ ]
yeah [ __ ] their third [ __ ] job just
like anybody else like they run numbers
and [ __ ] try to get money for their
town so to say that they're not giving
out tickets to hit a quota is [ __ ]
[ __ ] so for them hiding and doing
[ __ ] sneaky to try and give you a ticket
that's [ __ ] up like we pay you
[ __ ] to just protect us don't
be like playing hide and seek with us I
had a realization though that cops like
I used to when I used to see a police
officer like eight cars back like you
know how you catch in the rearview
mirror and like you see the cop but
there's so many cars in between mm-hmm I
used to still like tap on the brakes and
try to slow down because I always felt
like this this month I have this the
kind of luck where this [ __ ]
would dip out around and then come back
and get me and skip everybody else even
if they're breaking laws too that's how
I would think but then I had a
realization one day because I drove by a
cop in the exact type of [ __ ] you just
described we're like they're hiding out
and waiting to NAB somebody and I've
driven past cops in situations like that
where I'm going 10 miles an hour or 15
miles an hour
the speed limit and I tap on the break
to try to make it good but I don't I
don't get it to the a good enough speed
fast enough but then I don't but then I
didn't get tickets it's happened a few
times and then I had a realization of
like well hold on a lot of them like
they're only gonna pull people over when
they're looking for people to pull over
like that [ __ ] might have been
sitting in his car eating a sandwich
yeah he might have seen me drive by
going fast he's like [ __ ] and then he
thought nah I'm not in the mood like
that's because it's a person in the car
but like you said and this is why I
definitely agree I think they do have
quotas is that by the end of the month
you always see them pulling more people
over because you know they have a budget
and they have to meet a certain amount
and so but I had that realization that
they're definitely like people too in
the sense that like if you were a cop I
was a cop like how often we just sit
there and be like I don't wanna pull his
[ __ ] over right now I'd do that
every single to you cuz the work that
has to go into it you got to follow the
guy for like four blocks and you don't
know who the [ __ ] you're pulling over
you don't know who you're pulling over
like you'd go anywhere from like an
elderly ass [ __ ] that like is just
elderly as [ __ ] and was just like ran
her stop sign because she didn't see the
[ __ ] and then you're gonna have to have
20 minute conversation with her about
how she ran a stop sign that she didn't
see ya so she's acting like she didn't
even really run the stop sign because
she doesn't think she ran the stop sign
but she actually did and then she's
gonna get turn into a grumpy old woman
and you just got to have that whole
interaction yeah when you could just be
sitting in your [ __ ] with that little
laptop on the side whatever on Facebook
chillin so here's the question here's a
controversial question do women have it
easier or harder in a situation where a
cop pulls them over easier 100 percent a
hundred thousand billion percent any
will try to woman who tries to meet to
this [ __ ] and say that it's not you
they're lying so what's your so what's
your argument as to why they have it
easier because I'm on the fence here
they can cry they can say they have to
go do you think the cop so most of the
time they look at the woman and like the
woman just has to flirt or the woman
just has to cry or something in the
they'll feel bad and they'll let him off
is that what you think well the majority
of cops I mean from what I know or I've
ever gotten pulled over or men so they
don't and and they're like manly men so
they try to maybe sympathize more with
or they don't understand women as much
so if a woman hit some with some [ __ ]
that they don't understand like oh it's
that time a month like I'm bleeding down
there or some [ __ ] and I gotta go excuse
like something like I can't be like I'm
bleeding from my vagina I can't get my
dick is bleeding that you get pulled
over you're like officer you won't
believe me man you're not gonna bug my
dick is bleeding actually he would let
you go of if he really believed you like
dick is bleeding yeah I just cut it with
scissors or something yeah that I mean
but like there's so many out cards that
a girl could play that a guy can't play
that many you know like what are you
gonna say it's on some [ __ ] where it's
like he knows everything you're gonna
say so the counter-argument is women
definitely feel in a situation like that
women definitely feel more vulnerable in
the sense that like a cop like a male
cop like a masculine cop like you were
talking about like they really do have
total control of the situation if it's a
woman and that can be intimidating
especially if the cop is not as kind of
corrupt and creepy and might be trying
to do some sexual [ __ ] no so that's the
flip side of it is like that there's a
bigger downside for a woman well know
what's the downside
well the downside is that the cops
creepy and you're glue to [ __ ] you know
you know they're gonna have the girls
have to live with that [ __ ] 24/7 you
know I know what I'm saying they did and
but the flip side of that is like it
could be easier for them in the sense
that they get more sympathy than a man
would because though the cop is a man
then they know like they're like
[ __ ] I know like what you're
doing if you're a dude like yeah you
were speeding don't try to [ __ ] say
anything you know what I mean like so
there's less sympathy in that sense I
feel like growing up
I heard more cases of women getting off
from tickets than i heard from men
getting all from tickets like I've heard
friends say like yeah I got a ticket and
it very rarely does it end with like
yeah I said something and then he was
like okay you get a warning or whatever
have you ever gotten a warning I think I
may have gotten a warning like once I've
got a couple warnings um which is nice
of them when they do that cuz it's like
I think the warning is almost like like
you didn't really [ __ ] up but I need to
pull somebody over and if you were a
dick I would give you a ticket
exactly yeah like that's them kind of
letting you know like I [ __ ] with you a
little bit yeah like I just met you now
you seem okay so okay yeah I got a
warning once when I first moved out to
Illinois I still have my New York plates
on but I'd been hopefully this cop
doesn't listen to the [ __ ] [ __ ] like
buckets in a road map I knew I said
wrote him a ticket but um I got pulled
over for I think I was texting or on my
phone or I might have been on my phone
and I still have my New York plates but
I've been living out there for a minute
and and I'm lucky because I had like the
town that I lived in sticker like in my
window and if he was a good cop he would
have did some investigative [ __ ] like so
I told him I was like oh I'm sorry
officer like you know I was calling
somebody for directions because I didn't
know where I am I'm from New York you
can see by my place so I sort of jeet
him with that the man um he was like all
right i'ma let you go oh and I was like
oh thank god and then when I left I
remembered that I had the town sticker
like on my car I was like you know if I
hit him with that lie which I did and
then he was like why do you have that
sticker on your car I'm a tourist and I
like it here I would have been got and
then I would have been out in handcuffs
and all that [ __ ] but the crazier thing
the crazier crazier thing is my
brother-in-law is is full black like
black people Spanish people don't have
that leeway like what are you just about
to say I'm just about to say is it
totally white people [ __ ] that like the
warning thing like would a black or
Spanish person listen to this and laugh
at the the thing I just said about a
warning because thanks oh that's like is
that like the white person's grace [ __ ]
it's like I don't think you're a
criminal because you're white you know
so domina let you off is that what it is
because I mean there is an argument for
that especially because like I've seen
the thing that really hit me like a ton
of bricks on that issue was the
statistics on stop and frisk and it
first of all it's like 90 is some insane
percentage like nineteen ninety-nine
point nine percent of the time or
something
something like that or 98 99 percent of
the time I don't forget the exact number
but it's really high they don't get
anything who's this what when they stop
and frisk you know and then it's also
it's overwhelmingly used on minorities
mm-hmm so that small percentage is
probably planted [ __ ] to that cops put
on them because I'm sure some some stuff
I'm sure it's planted but so like they
basically the whole point of the law is
to just be able to stop minorities and
and like frisk them and like make sure
you don't have anything which is crazy
because it's such a [ __ ] up for such
an obvious violation of their
constitutional rights because it's we're
supposed to be equal under the law which
means if you're gonna do stop and frisk
at least in theory you're supposed to
have people like if you frisk the
[ __ ] on Wall Street guarantee you so
many of them have cocaine yeah but don't
get me wrong I'm not saying frisk the
wall street people I'm just saying also
don't fresque people in the minority
communities but it was the statistics on
that that I was like holy [ __ ] like
there's an over policing issue in
certain areas and and that's why they
problem I don't know I would guess that
people have not if you're black or
Spanish you probably don't have that
that I mean I got off once yes I mean I
smokes my brother know about this and I
was like when you get pulled over like I
was like I told him was like when I get
pulled over like I can almost hit the
cop with if I'm a little unsure of what
I did
I can almost hit him with some questions
[ __ ] like why are you pulling me over
like and be like a little assertive like
you know like I don't think I did that
you know and like him have to like come
back with something like no you did
here's this the reason why blah blah
blah and he was like if I get pulled
over it's yes sir no sir like it's just
it's a wild like dynamic that like we
should all be [ __ ] equal we should all
be allowed to say the same [ __ ] the same
cops whatever you know but like he's got
a
get brought up like knowing different
driving you know like yeah knowing you
can't say some [ __ ] to a cop yep the two
times I had a shitty experience with a
cop one I got pulled over and he said I
was on my cell phone and I wasn't yeah
he was he was trying to and this cop was
black too and he was trying to hit me
with some he's a hundred [ __ ] like no
you were on your and I was like no I was
I literally went to court and contested
it on principle like didn't know [ __ ]
you will you and I brought I brought my
[ __ ] cell phone records I was like
look this is the time help me look this
I was not on the phone playing simple
and actually what happened was I was
driving and I always drive with one hand
so I had one hand and this was when I
had a Chevy Blazer and so the the center
console like you could rest your arm on
that so I was driving like this sitting
like this and I was rapping along with
this song and so when I got pulled over
he was like you were on your phone and
her again to take it I was like I wasn't
on my phone and he started he was
getting mad at me and he was trying to
sun me and I was like I wasn't on my
phone so I was one shitty experience I
had with a cop oh so tell so do you
remember if the cuz those type of my
mom's been to court and she's trying to
be on some [ __ ] we're like I'm gonna
fight this and they're always just like
boom just like were you able to show
your records and like fight for I didn't
even have to yeah they just chopped it
there's the cop isn't there
they don't reduce it cuz you managed to
show up but I do always have to pay the
surcharge so you always have to pay for
just going into the court but it was
like it was $50 when it was gonna be
like 200 or 250 years up here you want
some Tom Cruise like show the air
marshal [ __ ] [ __ ] but you had your
records ready to go just I was ready
with my like Glenn Beck conspiracy
chalkboard where you I draw out like Z
and then what happened was so I was one
and then the other bad experience and
this was interesting because me and my
friend I was wearing like a bandana type
[ __ ] it was like the summer I was in a
wife-beater I was wearing basketball
shorts you used to rock a bandana like
the dude from the what's that
the Crips know there's that viral [ __ ]
of the guy wearing the red bandana I
can't even think but keep going my bad
but I so I had the bandana on it was the
summer so I was tan as [ __ ] smoking a
cigarette this is back when I smoked
friend similar look
he probably had a fitted hat on but
we're both white kids but the cop pulled
us over and I was like damn is this what
it's like how it's like to be treated by
cop when you're a minority because he
pulled us over get this he gave us a
ticket I wasn't driving I was in the
passenger seat were loud music I smiled
and he was never seen anybody more he
was so aggressive like the cop was so
aggressive in that he did like we
couldn't say anything he wouldn't let
him you wouldn't let us say anything it
was one of those situations it was
really weird and then I didn't I didn't
piece it together at the time I don't
think but later on I look back on the
situation and I was like oh it's cuz we
look like what he thinks it are punk
kids like punk kid oh you're gonna wear
a bandana a little [ __ ] white boy
from the suburbs else we gonna do you
know where bandana well fine I'm gonna
[ __ ] give you a ticket and treat you
like a piece of [ __ ]
alright I once got pulled over by a guy
there used to be a guy who played cards
with us who was a cop his name was like
Rob the cop oh yeah remember that mm-hmm
I got pulled over by him once oh he
definitely let you off he let me off the
[ __ ] I was like dude we play cards in
general gamble we played the same legal
[ __ ] together so bust me on some ship
I'm coming right to the police house
right now and I'm riding your ass out
and say any of that [ __ ] but I was just
shoot man and I think he let me go I
also once got pulled over and I had I
just came back from like D or something
I had my brother's ID in my wallet and
the cop tried to say some [ __ ] but he
let me go too just like don't don't have
that or something like that oh but he
knew taking one look at it cuz you look
enough like your brother that if a cop
sees you for the first time you might
know cuz I pulled my [ __ ] out and like
his was still in there
what's that and I was like oh [ __ ] and I
was like I was just in a country
whatever it's like 18 a drink or some
[ __ ] but I had a caddy but I don't
remember who it was fake IDs for us back
in the day you used to be able to chalk
those shits like my brother could like
chalk a fake ID Oh so take your ID and
make the change your birthday yeah and
some people who had like the better
number like you feel like like 88 you
could turn into the 80 mm and I could
get rid of the like a like a little
space and they ate a little bit but that
was what people used to do back in the
day was like chalk and ID you would just
legit like get some I think the color
was in red and you would just do the red
on the ID chalk that [ __ ] and that's
what everybody did but now the IDS have
like that line going through it yeah I
just had a fake one I wish I never
understood how bartenders not
bartender's like bouncers they don't
care man it's just plausible deniability
I said they don't care and then you're
telling me you Kyle you know what a
[ __ ] ID from Montana looks like and
this next clip is absolutely fascinating
this is Fox News talking about
Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and they are
baffled they really can't put their
finger on her popularity and exactly
what it is she represents but what
you're gonna notice here is even though
there's some you know dissenting and AH
this is not good like there you get that
sense a little bit but compare the
vitriol directed towards Alexandria here
compare that to the amount of vitriol
that they end up putting towards you
know Hillary Clinton for example or
Barack Obama so they don't know how to
handle her take a look
you're concerned at all that your party
is going too far to the left to either
win in the midterms or win back the
White House well I think that you can't
win the White House without the Midwest
and I don't think that you can go too
far to the left and still win the
Midwest Ocasio Cortes the former
organizer for senator Bernie Sanders
presidential campaign she's firing back
pointing out that policies to the left
of Hillary Clinton one in several
Midwestern states Kimberly what do you
make of this yeah I think it's pretty
interesting she's a compelling you know
political figure in terms of she acceded
you know the expectations people were
really pretty much betting that crowley
who was well established with the
democratic party someone who was
supposed to be seen as in a part of the
future of the Democratic Party in terms
of the leadership perhaps succeeding
Nancy Pelosi was a you know taken out
like that by relative newcomer but I
mean some of the policies similar yes to
Bernie Sanders she campaigned alongside
him but you know given the the relative
level of the seed etc it was like
covering on all across the network's you
know this weekend and all the sunday
shows so look they're looking to it as a
momentum enthusiasm generator for the
party but I think it's fraught with
problems in terms of being that far left
is not necessarily you know kind of sort
of mainstream election guaranteeing you
know wins people go wow this seems a
little fringe this is not workable or
tenable so therefore I'm feeling
even more alienated from the party so
Chris and Dana do me a favor and walk
through some things let's say free
education free health care guaranteed
incomes I think a lot of people who are
populist so they would identify both
with Sanders and Trump would say yeah
those are things that we want absolutely
and in fact when we talk about the
shifting political dynamics inside the
country one of the things that's going
on is the the big move of poor and
working-class white voters away from the
Democratic Party and to the Republican
Party well guess what they're gonna
bring the same demands with them when
they get there
and for those voters things like you
know the Republican and stalwart lines
about we're gonna reform Social Security
no we're going to we're gonna grow back
Obama care stop so the as a Republican
base is shifting they're getting new
mandates from their their folks now none
of that is to say that it's workable for
Democrats to build a strategy which and
no one would to build a strategy around
a twenty eight-year-old first-time
congresswoman from the Bronx and and the
Republicans would like to make her the
face of the Democratic Party I see the
red socialists fist back there for added
effect where my che guevara but but my
point being again Republicans want to
turn her into the face of the Democratic
Party Democrat leaders I'm sure are
biting there anything bad about her but
this really is the Democrats Tea Party
moment the energy and intensity and
passion that these younger people are
bringing to their movement into their
party just might be enough for them to
take back the house and it's certainly
going to make primaries and places like
where Joe Crowley is you know lazy
doesn't campaign well it doesn't even
show up to his debate like yeah they're
going to lose but is it enough to form a
governing majority and I think you could
ask John Boehner or Paul Ryan yeah
that's a good question Bader's mode is
on
for our own che guevara yes the theme of
all of our stories today is that
Democrats are pushing their la Quan ok
yes why do they keep picking far-left
people as their stars Elizabeth Warren
whoever you pick at Bernie Sanders I
mean they love these far left
politicians but I mean come on look at
her she's I'd vote for Tammy Duckworth
was right this isn't a bit it's not even
that big of an upset when you look at oh
it's not an upset no she knocked on
doors she didn't really work that hard
and she posted a picture of the tennis
shoes that she wore walking her district
and how they were completely worn on the
bottom and she did a lot of miles of
them she worked for it and then and the
tea party Republicans worked for it too
they don't know what to do with her she
doesn't fit into an easy mold in their
mind where they could just kind of you
know put her off to the side and say
well this fits in that category and
that's the end of it you could tell that
many of them have mixed feelings you
know some of them are like oh yeah too
far left for in something something but
then even a lot of the right-wingers
can't help but give her credit and there
was a good point made about populism
there where there were some Trump voters
who looked at him and they liked the
fact that he was economically populist
and he was you know against the trade
deals and he said I'm not gonna cut
Social Security and so voters like that
look at the idea of free college and
free healthcare and they go yeah I like
that and it does you could scream far
left until the cows come home but if the
idea is being advocated for are
inherently appealing screaming far left
doesn't do Dickie mcgee-zax
you're not going to convince people
against it and that's the point by the
way of Justice Democrats and Alexandria
Ocasio Cortes and even Bernie Sanders
the idea is and this is why we win in
the Midwest like that argument from
Tammy Duckworth
again absolutely ridiculous because
Bernie Sanders destroyed in the Midwest
and defeated Hillary Clinton there yes
we have a lot
appeal in red states and we also have a
lot of appeal in blue states we have
appeal everywhere because the ideas are
inherently appealing so and they
reference the Tea Party there and said
okay this is the left-wing Tea Party
movement now substantively no cuz it's
fundamentally opposite but in terms of
the dynamic yes where the Tea Party was
originally this movement on the right
where they were like a [ __ ] you
establishment figures establishment
Republicans we're coming after you and
so one of the things that they would you
know really double down on triple down
on is this idea of tax cuts and they
would frame it as tax cuts for the
little guy now obviously Republicans
when they end up doing their tax cuts
it's overwhelmingly geared towards the
rich so there's lying in the in the
presentation of it and the marketing of
it where they say oh we're gonna cut
your taxes but they really end up doing
it for the rich predominantly but there
is something to even working-class
people even people on the left there's
an inherent appeal about the idea of tax
cuts when they say we're gonna cut your
taxes why because people think well I
want to keep more of my own money who
does want to keep more of their own
money so that was a populist idea when
you tell working-class people
hey these Republicans are sellouts
they're not fighting for you they're the
establishment figures were
anti-establishment we're gonna fight for
you in Washington one of the first
things we're gonna do is cut your taxes
so that's something that like the Tea
Party took over the Republican Party and
it worked because there were
anti-establishment figures now again you
could argue hey was astroturf and
eventually it was co-opted by the Koch
brothers and others and that's true but
look at what we're doing on the Left on
the left it's the same thing it's just
the in the opposite direction so we say
if cutting taxes for working-class
people that message is inherently
appealing on the right and across the
country many people on the Left would
say yeah I want to keep more of my own
money what the [ __ ] do you think free
college is when people are saddled with
one over one trillion dollars in student
loan debt what do you think free health
care is when every other developed
country has it and when medical bills is
one of the top causes of bankruptcy in
the u.s. it doesn't matter how much you
scream far left far left socialism
communism
if Alexandria and Justus Democrats keep
saying we're for medicare-for-all
we're for free college we're for a
living wage we're for ending the wars
we're for creating jobs in this country
with a new New Deal
we're for doing a big infrastructure
deal we're for legalizing marijuana
those are all inherently popular ideas
so you're [ __ ] buzz words and labels
don't override the popularity of those
ideas which is why they seem so
ineffectual to fight back against her
and that's why when you look at how they
go after somebody like Hillary there's a
lot of vitriol there but when they try
to go after Alexandria they're like yeah
she's far left and the thing is that's
the fringe but she really did outwork
the other person and she wore out the
soul of her the soles of her shoes and
she did talk to her constituents and
that was kind of good and so they don't
this we're gonna win we're gonna win
when we go populist left we're already
seeing it Alexandria already has one of
the biggest social media presence is
presence presences of compared to almost
all other politicians in the country
dominating others so this is what
happens there's there's an inherent
innate appeal of the ideas that we're
pushing for which is why they stumble
and fall all over themselves when they
try to fight back against it on the one
hand you get right-wingers who are more
honest and they react like the five
reacted here or they're like yeah she's
too far left but I kind of like her cuz
you worked hard and she would talk to
her people and she's kind of fighting
for them she's populist and and then if
when and you don't get that crowd what
else do you get the smear merchants and
the smear merchants always fall flat
because they overreach and they sound
like the [ __ ] idiots they are smear
merchants for example being like ben
shapiro and alex jones who have been out
there saying the most hyperbolic
[ __ ] statements about her we did a
segment go check it out for both of them
ben shapiro and alex jones alex jones
said she's run by the big bank she
overwhelmingly like 70% of her donations
were from regular people working people
and it was they were under two hundred
dollar donations when you include the
legal limit 2,700 that's for the
individual donations the legal limit
uh all of her donations were from
individuals and was under that amount so
she basically 100% people funded she's
one of the only politicians who's not
bought by the big banks and he goes into
[ __ ] backwards Ville and he says JA
she's run by the big guy communists and
she calls he calls her a communist it's
just so stupid so ok give us the smear
merchants fine
give us the right-wingers who are more
honest and they're like yeah I kind of
like her even though I don't like her
and this is why we're gonna win man we
are definitely gonna win and I noticed
this even in my personal life I spoke to
somebody who is a big-time Trump
supporter and you know we were talking
about Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and
I wasn't trying to be confrontational I
tried to talk about issues where I'm
more mixed on Trump whether it's the
North Korea thing okay I kind of support
the idea of talking over bombing yay I
spoke about trade and said I don't like
exactly how he's doing it but I I like
the idea of trying to protect us jobs
and tariffs I don't think he's going
about it the right way but I kind of
like that underlying philosophy that
he's working toward so I was trying to
be conciliatory and stuff and I don't
want to argue and then the issue of
Democratic leadership came up Chuck
Schumer Nancy Pelosi and I was like I
hate him I hate him I think they're
terrible I think they're Wall Street
bought Big Pharma bought so on and so
forth and then we got to Alexandria and
the person I was talking to was like
what about this new one that was well I
was like that's justice Democrats that's
us that's that's populist left
that's that'll win and again it was an
instance of you see this person trying
to formulate an argument to come out
against Alexandria cuz this person is a
right winger but they just don't have
anything I mean bring up Hillary Clinton
they'll [ __ ] go for an hour and a
half you can't even step in it's like
double dutch you know how they do the
thing and you're like trying to get in
there trying to get in there that's what
a conversation is like with the
Republican when somebody brings up
Hillary Clinton go they go and you know
68% of the [ __ ] they say is [ __ ] but
then some of its true and you're like
yeah okay that one's true she's totally
bought by Wall Street
but when Alexandria came up all there
was like it was a pause and was like I
gotta try to come out against her and
then it was like yeah but you know that
she can't they can't win in the Midwest
ER I was like Oh
batter up [ __ ] that's a softball down
the center of the play let me knock that
out of the park Bernie Sanders
obliterated Hillary in the Midwest
because he's populist Alexandria is
populist this is the exact philosophy
that's needed in the Midwest not this
[ __ ] corporate centrist
neoliberalism where they serve big
pharma and Wall Street and pretend like
average Joes in the Midwest who our
farmers are like you know I really wish
they'd deregulate goldman sachs a little
more meiyan that's not a thing so they
can't they don't know how to argue you
have the smear merchants who fall flat
because they overreach and you have the
people who are more honest who are like
yeah I kind of like or even though
far-left is bad so we're gonna win we're
gonna win these are inherently appealing
ideas and you can have all of the
[ __ ] propaganda in the world trying
to override it it's not gonna work it's
not gonna work and by the way this is
political messaging 101 which is
something I've been trying to get across
to Democrats forever they have this they
don't know how to say it plain man they
don't know how to say it plain like
you're not gonna get [ __ ] professors
you know combing through something like
it's a dissertation or a thesis like let
me look at the nuances of this argument
to see where they're at no you need
inherently appealing ideas which is why
the Tea Party again even though they got
were co-opted by the establishment and
became very establishment the original
message was anti-establishment and it
was you know I'm gonna cut your taxes so
you can't like the response from the
Democrats shouldn't be that's a bad idea
cuz then how do people interpret that oh
the Democrats want to raise my taxes the
Tea Party wants to cut my taxes so you
can't you should never engage in a
battle against inherently appealing
ideas because you're never gonna win
that battle because nuance
often times doesn't sell so how do we
win in the realm of competing
philosophies and policies and ideas well
the answer is use your inherently
appealing ideas because guess what we
have way more of them
if the I'm gonna cut taxes for you
argument on the right is inherently
appealing you know what else is
inherently appealing free college living
wage Medicare for all and the wars new
New Deal legalized marijuana and the
drug war those are all really popular
ideas that you don't you don't even need
to say anything else you could just
repeat those words on the campaign trail
and you'll win in a landslide but the
Democrats love to [ __ ] make [ __ ] [ __ ]
complicated and complex and convoluted
and watered-down and overly nuanced and
then they trot out the [ __ ]
platitudes which by the way there's no
way to get people to hate you more than
the speed platitudes and cliches people
can see through platitudes and cliches
from a mile and a half away and they
know you're just filling the room with
the noises instead of keeping it real so
we're gonna win and this clip from Fox
News really gives me hope because they
don't know how to deal with Alexandria
and they won't know how to deal with
other justice Democrats you're gonna
have the smear merchants and they'll
fall flat because they'll overreach and
you'll have the more honest ones who are
like I don't like them but I kind of
like them and that's nothing but a
benefit for us across the board
goodness gracious boy oh boy do I have
some incredible news for all of you I
didn't want to wait any longer to share
this with you so I decided to do a
little impromptu style segment right now
I'm sure most of you already know by now
but let's run through it yesterday was
just an incredible incredible night for
the left it can't be overstated how big
it was because it was the first real
declaration of like we're here we're a
force and you're not gonna play Kate us
you're not gonna run your typical
corporatist tricks on us we're a tsunami
we're movement and we're not taking no
for an answer because when you look at
the opinion polls the American people
agree with us certainly the base of the
Democratic Party agrees with us and we
should be electing people who represent
us and I'm not kidding when I say the
establishment really had no clue this
was coming they were completely and
utterly baffled by the results of last
night so let's run through a bunch of it
this is the our revolution Twitter feed
here they do a lot of you know more
local races but I still just want to
give you the full scope of just how
solid a day it was yesterday for the
left I only saw two losses out of all
the elections or I should say I only saw
two prominent losses out of all the
elections it was wall-to-wall victories
so okay here you go guy named Vaughn
Stewart endorsed by our revolution won
for the Maryland House of Delegates
again I told you these are the smaller
races here Gabriel a Severo won in
Maryland for the House of Delegates
Angela Graham in Oklahoma for state
representative
you know there's a there's a bunch of
these to be fair I don't even know a lot
of these people because again these are
more local races than anything else but
look boom look at the first big one we
get to hear who's that
that is Ben Jealous so Ben Jealous is
also a justice Democrat he of course was
a big-time Bernie supporter and he's for
all the right policies Medicare for all
living wage so on and so forth and he
won he won for governor for Maryland the
primary so again this is one of those
this is one of those races where the
establishment lined up against him but
he cracked skulls anyone that was a huge
victory gigantic victory but there was
an even bigger one look at what we have
here Democratic Socialist wins biggest
upset of 2018 we all know who that is
Alexandria Ocasio Cortes CNN says a 28
year old Latina owl stood a 10 term
incumbent in New York in the most
shocking upset of the political season
this is without a doubt the Democrats
Eric Cantor moment so for those of you
who don't know Eric Cantor was in
Republican leadership and he got knocked
off by a more populist candidate by the
name of David Brett nobody on the right
saw that coming in fact I was literally
unprecedented well Ocasio core excuse me
joseph Crowley was the heir apparent to
Nancy Pelosi's throne he spoke about how
he was quote destined for democratic
leadership I mean this guy is the
ultimate corporatist
neoliberal insider
and he was ousted by Alexandria Ocasio
Cortes so take a look at some more of
this stuff here this is incredible
people for Bernie says Joe Crowley was
endorsed by Kirsten Gillibrand Andrew
Cuomo Chuck Schumer the Sierra Club the
Human Rights Campaign Christine Quinn
moms demand action at least 28 unions
near all Planned Parenthood and over 100
more elected officials and then you can
see here Daniel Marin says from a
National Democratic strategist the
Crowley team did not raise any red flags
or ask allies for help with his primary
I saw tweets yesterday where reporter
spoke to Democratic strategists in
Washington DC and I kid you not they
said we don't expect New York 14 to be a
competitive race by the way they were
right it wasn't competitive but it
wasn't competitive in the opposite
direction that they thought it wasn't
gonna be competitive
she won I think she got 57 or 58 percent
of the vote she kind of crushed him I
mean this is huge
okay Matt Stoller says Crowley's donors
who lost tonight look at this list man
Facebook Google Blackrock Humana
Raytheon Capital One by the way pause
right here we've already you know gotten
all the people who are destroying our
politics for-profit health insurance
companies banks the military-industrial
complex Wall Street and we just we're
just getting started with the list
Aflac Microsoft Cigna TD Bank H&R Block
salesforce.com United technology dental
wit Covington and Burling anheuser-busch
Honeywell Crowley donors who lost
tonight part two American Bankers
Association Citigroup UPS t-mobile
Altria which is Philip Morris Ernst &
Young this guy was just a grab bag of
corruption
he was as corrupt as it gets he was the
ultimate corporatist this is a guy who
left in the middle of a debate about
Wall Street regulation to raise money
from Wall Street and then he came back
and voted against regulating Wall Street
he is terrible he voted for the Iraq war
he voted for the Iraq war he is the most
corporate of the corporate the most
establishment of the establishment he is
the ultimate insider and he was just out
stood by the ultimate outsider and then
look at this this is from Jeff Stein
Jeff Stein says I put this together
yesterday but look at Alexandria Ocasio
Cortez's reliance on small donors versus
that of the entire New York City
congressional delegation including Joe
Crowley look at this look at this you
know Gregory Meeks taking 1.3 percent of
his money from small donors smaller than
$200 grace maying 4% I mean the best we
have other than Ocasio Cortes is Jerrold
Nadler at 9.2 percent 70% of Alexandria
Ocasio Cortez's money came from small
donors and again small donors is defined
as people giving under $200 when you if
you were to count small donors as just
legal individual donations so in other
words 2700 dollars or less from
individuals I'm pretty sure all of
Alexandria Ocasio Cortez's money came
from them so look at this the blue line
is Ocasio Cortes that is that says
everything right there that says
absolutely everything about this race
and look at this
Joseph Crowley
raised three point three million dollars
he spent 3.4 Alexandria Ocasio Cortes
raised a little over three hundred
thousand spent a hundred and ninety four
thousand
and she beat him I can't overstate how
important this isn't how big this is
we're here we're not going anywhere this
is the rise of the left and there's only
gonna be more of this to come and why
did she win she won because she's not
corrupt she would scream that through a
megaphone that she wasn't corrupt
everybody knew she wasn't corrupt she
was getting small dollar donations they
organized like crazy by the way joy cot
Chakrabarty was one of the original
founders of justice democrats along with
myself and Janki ogre and Zac Exley he
ended up running Alexandria Ocasio
Cortez's campaign and he did a fantastic
job just as Democrats are to thank for
this democratic socialists of America
are to thank for this all of these
left-wing populist left groups that were
on the ground knocking on doors
canvassing getting the word out there
this is how we win these really are
races of people power versus money and
listen I'm not gonna sit here and lie to
you guys often times money wins out and
that is [ __ ] beyond depressing but
sometimes money does not win out and
sometimes people power overrides it and
this is an example of a perfect storm
this was a perfect storm where the
populist candidate was able to ask a
just a behemoth a political machine of a
man and by the way I can't tell you how
annoying it's been to look at so many of
the establishment outlets and so many of
the so-called political journalists
commenting on this I mean Joanne Reid
tweeted pretty sure all of all of you
know all political journalists are doing
a crash course on Alexandria Ocasio
Cortes tonight no you first of all you
should have been do
a long time ago where were you a goddamn
a year ago Politico and New York Times
had these articles alike who is
Alexandria Ocasio Cortez you were
supposed to [ __ ] tell us that a year
ago you dip shits if you were serious
and you did your goddamn job
you would already know about her you
would already have reported on or you
would have already have educated
everybody about her but she didn't do it
and he didn't do it because you're
biased in favor of the Democratic
establishment and you're biased in favor
of big money and then you get blindsided
and you're like oh [ __ ] there might
actually be some candidates out there
that care about people and represent
them so it was the organizing it was the
grassroots it was the fighting that won
this race and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez
is a superb candidate she ran on
Medicare for all she ran on free college
she ran on a living wage she ran on
ending the wars she ran on abolishing
ice bold clear progressive vision and
she was able to take down a political
machine she took down the entire
establishment the left took down the
entire establishment so I was um I was
near tears last night because of how
important this is it really is I can't
overstate it I don't think the segment
I'm doing here and the words I'm using
or really doing it justice because what
this does is this breathes air into the
left this breathes life into the left
because listen I'm of the belief we
weren't doing poorly beforehand I mean
when you look at justice Democrats you
look at our revolution you look at all
these different groups fighting for
left-wing change P triple see you name
it we were winning 40 to 50% of our
races so that's solid but the thing is
there was no there was no leading
example there was no clear middle finger
in a prominent race you know if Allison
Hartson pulled it out that would have
been one example of it if Paula G and
Swearengen defeated Joe Manchin that
would have been another
couple of it but let me tell you
something even though those were Senate
races and this is a house race this is
just as big as it would have been in
those instances because Joe Crowley
again is the heir apparent to Nancy
Pelosi he's thrown he was gonna be he's
the fourth leading Democrat in the
country
he was planning on being one of the top
first or second leading Democrats in the
country and now and now look at him he's
unemployed and he should be unemployed
and he's unemployed by a superb
candidate who's fighting for all of the
right policies that'll fix this country
it's Bernie Sanders vision and then some
so I'm happy I'm proud and I think this
is there's a really important takeaway
from this which is never give up never
give up never give up never give up
never give up never give up because
sometimes you're gonna lose man
sometimes you're gonna [ __ ] lose you
know it doesn't matter how good you are
and how much you have all your ducks in
a row
you're gonna lose sometimes man you're
gonna lose sometimes Tiger Woods
probably the greatest golfer ever what
does he have 20% victory rate so you
know he only won two out of every ten
tournaments and he's the best ever [ __ ]
is that what is that what does that show
you it's easy to lose and then get down
on ourselves or say you know what I
[ __ ] quit this I've had that feeling
before I'm sure all of you have had that
feeling before where we're like okay you
know what are we wasting time here is
that we're doing are we is this is
nothing gonna ever change so let's just
go let's just stop let's just drop the
burden and move on to something else and
mentally check out that's an appealing
thought sometimes that's an appealing
thought sometimes but then you guarantee
that you lose then there's no question
then it's a given that you lose cuz
you're not even in the game so the
establishment will keep chugging along
you win by fighting and never giving up
even if you lose one race run another if
you lose to run a third if you lose
three run a fourth it's hard nobody said
it was gonna be easy
but we can do this thing man we can do
this thing by the way the two losses I
was referencing earlier the two
progressive losses Dylan Ratigan lost in
his district which is a shame because
Dylan Ratigan is would have been a
tremendous um politician and Chelsea
Manning lost but to be honest I don't
even know if that's the the worst thing
in the world because she's dealing with
some stuff and she probably should go
deal with that stuff and get everything
sorted but anyway over-the-moon happy
there's new life in the left and this is
a big moment it's a big moment for the
future of the country and the future of
the Democratic Party because this is
what's that saying we planted the flag
in the sand is that what that thing is
I'm not sure it does it sounds a little
off but this is us saying we're a force
the left is a force and if the
establishment thinks they're just gonna
run roughshod over us from now until
forever boy do they have something else
coming
Alex Jones lashed out at Joe Rogan and
it was absolutely bonkers let's watch
I'm not trying to beat Joe Rogan a lap
dog of the system I'm trying to change
the world and I'm doing it and as for
Joe since I brought that up I meant to
do this I'm going to do it now cue him
up if you can find it I was into it last
week and I didn't do it I'm doing it
because I don't lose sleep over nothing
and I'm gonna lose the sleep over not
saying this so I'm gonna do it right now
kill him up saying George Soros was
captured by the Nazis now he got it good
no I don't care about coming on your
podcast I don't need to come on your
podcast but my point is though I know
you're as smart as I am or smarter and I
sit there and I watched you on your show
or I'm wrong about Bourdain but then you
have your guys go oh look we discovered
the Clintons were after him and he was
this and that and then and then oh and
then Alex you know Alex Alex he you know
he's just wrong about all this stuff and
he says Soros worked with the Nazi Soros
was captured by the Nazis he'll Joe why
not just say he cut it lers head off and
fought him in a castle and then and
Hitler was guarded by 5000 werewolves
and and and naked strippers in SS
uniforms I'm not stupid I get to hear my
son listen to his podcast almost every
day I hear it to the point of I don't
want to watch it because I don't want to
start saying stuff cuz I care about Joe
Joe's a good guy he's done a lot of good
work he's really a libertarian patriot
but he's out there in Los Angeles with
his family and every time I see this
stuff
he's misrepresenting what I've said in
what I've done he says oh I like Alex
but then he Snipes me oh I like you Alex
oh I like you I was the good guy he's
wrong he's wrong he's wrong he's wrong
he's like he's like my other best buddy
Eddie Bravo Eddie you're a crazy dumbass
boom slam your head in the ground aren't
you a nice little guy putting up with me
saying that I already know our number
one Joe
get that isn't about being number one
it's about change in the world and you
have the power to do that does let me
tell you something Joe they're gonna
release bio weapons soon to try to stop
Trump in this movement
Oh Alex Jones is wrong about Anthony
Bourdain hey Joe I talked to the people
that were there in the production at the
highest levels they're involved the
Pentagon everything else I know all
about it
Elon Musk I mean I mean Joe I'm not
gonna tell you you know who I talked to
yesterday or who I talked to this
afternoon so just let's quit pretending
that we aren't the tip of the spear and
then Joe takes DMT and talks about
seeing space aliens and other dimensions
and then I talk about the globalist
taking drugs and believing they're
getting knowledge from other dimensions
and I'm the biggest cook in the world oh
I had Alex some people think I like Alex
I like him as a friend but he's a total
nut ball
any money talking about interdimensional
child molesters psychic vampires he's
crazy
oh really I don't take DMT it's fine
that you did I'm a libertarian and then
and then I don't sit there and think I'm
communicate with aliens the people I'm
talking about do because if you're a
good person and you take the DMT and go
to the fifth dimension six dimension if
you believe in that stuff they act real
friendly but masculino gets mean later
he's a goat by the way it's bathroom
that's who you meet it happens to
basically everybody unless you're a
really good guy
and then you get transported to a space
prison for a couple hundred thousand
years and then when you come back you
don't ever come back now I've never
taken it but I've talked people I knew
about this when I was a kid from people
that I knew that were involved in CIA
trials at Berkeley Oh tell me about DMT
Joe tell me all about you know how you
popularized in the last 15 years the
clockwork elves yeah I heard about the
clockwork elves nice little kid and I
decided I don't want to see him cuz
everybody sees them little goat
creatures with little green hats and
little green uniforms it looks just like
grey aliens then they pull their masks
off they don't look quite like that
anymore they were a little gray mass so
they don't get too scary cuz they look
like little gremlins little demons now
so you'll probably play
that's a look how crazy you please
little gremlin demons no you - you
talked about it you saw it you believed
it you I didn't take it the Bible says
don't be part of pharmakeia cuz it gives
you the evil spirits okay I didn't used
to believe that growing up and then I
learned the CIA is taking this to get
interdimensional communications you say
you've had those interdimensional
communications show I haven't had them
you have but I'm the coop yeah there's
Bourdain saying he's been experiencing
Hilary's wrath it's no fun but you know
Alex Jones is wrong for even asking a
question dad I'm sorry that was
particularly disturbing okay so first of
all the Bourdain thing is like it's just
so beyond the pale man on the day that
he [ __ ] died Alex Jones was already
out there coming up with conspiracy
theories listen dude you don't know what
the [ __ ] you're talking about
you certainly don't know before the
goddamn medical examiners know so you
can cocked all of these conspiracy
theories and let's face it what you're
doing is you're politicizing the death
of somebody so you're trying to get some
sort of political gain out of somebody's
death and then you take these out of
context tweets where he talks about oh
I've been on the receiving end of you
know the wrath of Hillary's operatives
and the interpretation that he takes
there is
well obviously Hillary Clinton had
Anthony Bourdain murdered listen I'm
100% sure I've said something to that
effect on Twitter but that was me saying
listen I've been attacked as like a
Bernie bro so being on the receiving end
of the wrath of Hillary's operatives is
like you know the social media presence
of people who are viciously arguing in
favor of her and making happy arguments
in favor of her you know the correct
direct correct the record spent a
million dollars to pump out like
pro-hillary trolls have many of us been
on the receiving end of those trolls yes
pretty
sure that's what Bourdain was talking
about not like oh my goodness they're
sending a hitman to murder me and this
idea of like and and the rest of the
conspiracy is even dumber it's all
because he was pro-trump well weird they
somehow missed Kanye West coming out to
be pro Trump even though Kanye West is
bigger than Anthony Bourdain so the
powers that be the Illuminati the
Bilderberg - globalist whatever the [ __ ]
you want to call them they're so genius
that they weren't able to stop a bigger
celebrity coming out to basically be pro
Trump and they also weren't able to stop
his [ __ ] election
so these bilderberg's are so organized
or you know this Illuminati group the
globalist the Hillary people are so
organized that they missed getting their
candidate elected and they missed the
fact that half the [ __ ] country and
many celebrities by the way are Pro
Trump but they just just one of them one
of them one of the celebrities they were
like we got to kill this guy for being
pro Trump there's no there's no logic
there there's no logic there whatsoever
and he's he's being like dense on
purpose it strikes me as and they're
also by the way when whenever Joe Rogan
did Joe Rogan his friends with Alex
Jones so whenever he disagreed with Alex
Jones he always like bent over backwards
to try to be conciliatory and try to be
kind and he would say something like hey
man he's been right about a lot of stuff
and then he would say stuff like the
agent provocateurs where the government
would send people into protests to start
being violent to then allow you know the
law enforcement to crack down on the
protests he would give him credit on
stuff like that
I've given Alex Jones credit on the NSA
stuff and the Patriot Act there was a
time when he was against the NSA and and
the Patriot Act and too much executive
authority in that realm so and Joe would
always bring that up whenever talking
about Alex Jones always always always
hits hits hits them with the line of
like well he's right about some things
but then yeah Alex when you were out
they're promoting the idea that Sandy
Hook was a [ __ ] conspiracy theory and
then by the way lying and saying that
you never said that when there's [ __ ]
compilations of you from like 20
different shows saying exactly that yeah
did people gonna disagree with that Joe
Rogan's gonna be like that's not cool
not only do I disagree with that that's
really [ __ ] up because what happened
is a lot of the family members of these
people who died are being harassed and
they're being harassed by people who
listen to you and think you're right
when you say that when you originally
said it there were no kids that died and
he's said a variety of different
conspiracy theories in regards to Sandy
Hook and then again he cut he started
he's disingenuous after the fact and
acts like I never said that yes you did
we have enough [ __ ] videotape you
goddamn liar so yeah Joe Rogan gonna
disagree with that
yeah Joe Rogan is gonna get upset when
you talk about how his friend by the way
Anthony Bourdain it's not that he
committed suicide he was murdered and
murdered by Hillary Clinton because he
was gonna come out to be pro Trump
it's just it's so [ __ ] gross man and
then you know what I got out of this
he's really insecure Alex Jones is
because it's like he doesn't acknowledge
the fact that you actually gave him
credit on some issues and is always
bending over backwards to be
conciliatory and kind to his friend
disregarded all of that and was just
like you're wrong you're wrong you're
wrong
mocking Joe for you know sometimes
disagreeing with him it's like dude what
do you expect you were literally talking
about interdimensional alien vampire
child molesters on his show and you
expect everybody to just take that at
face value as if it's some sort of
factual comment come the [ __ ] on man is
he serious is out shown serious or is he
some sort of you know character is he
doing some sort of game where he's this
character and his performance art I
don't know I would hope that's it
because if it's that's not it then good
goodness gracious are we in trouble okay
and then I love how and by the way the
segment was like 25 minutes long you
only saw a little snippet of it there
but he talks about how they're gonna
release bio weapons to stop Trump and
the movement he just he always drops the
that are like insane comments that
require a tremendous amount of evidence
if it doesn't provide the evidence he
just drops the statements as if it's
like a matter of fact as if it's like
well of course they're gonna release bio
weapons to stop the Trump movement then
my favorite part he talks about DMT and
he attacks Joe Rogan for promoting DMT
and he says oh people take DMT and they
see aliens in other dimensions and he
kind of straw man's Joe Rogan as if Joe
Rogan said oh I took DMT and I
definitely saw things from other
dimensions again that's not true what
Joe Rogan says and he says it very
clearly and I've heard him say it
multiple times is I don't know what
happens when I take DMT it certainly
feels like I'm connecting with another
dimension it could all be in my mind but
either way it feels the same it feels as
if it's a genuine you know some sort of
out-of-body insane like religious
experience it feels the same whether
you're actually connecting with another
dimension or if it's just all in your
mind so what's the difference so he
never said I know that there are aliens
I know that there are other dimensions I
know that I'm communicating with [ __ ]
elves like he never said that you are
pretending he said that so then you get
to turn around and say oh and I'm the
crazy one yes Alex you are the crazy one
because unlike Joe you actually make
claims a fact that there are
interdimensional aliens and [ __ ]
vampires and pedophiles run the world
and so stop like he's being really
disingenuous when he makes a lot of
these points um and then I like how he
just drops in their quote you go to
space prison for a couple hundred
thousand years so in other words if you
if I guess if you take DMT and you have
a bad trip you go to space prison for a
couple hundred thousand years and he
makes this smug face like nailed it
gotcha
you know most [ __ ] all what does I
mean you don't know the [ __ ] you're
talking about you don't know the [ __ ]
you're talking about
and they talk about little goat
creatures like a little
it's bossom it so in other words oh
you're communicating was like the devil
and they talked about the Bible he says
all the Bible's against it so I don't do
it can you just come out of the Pat
Robertson closet Alex please just come
out and say I'm like John Hagee I'm like
Pat Robertson I'm like every single
Jerry Falwell every single insane
uber fundamentalist Christian in the
country that's me now because we're
gonna do another story later Alex Jones
spent all this week talking about how
different people are the devil literal
demons Hillary Clinton's a literal demon
Bob Dylan is a literal D I'm serious
he's been talking about that all week
like although their demons demon
possession and devil worship and so just
stop like there was a time Alex when you
were the conspiracy guy and like okay
he rants about what's really going on
and who's really controlling things and
you know and you were wrong about a lot
of stuff but hey at least you would talk
about civil liberties from time to time
and at least you would talk about how
war is stupid now look at your show it's
all [ __ ] fundamentalist religious
garbage and [ __ ] on your friend and
pretending your friend said he connected
with another dimension when no you're
the one who says you know that there are
other dimensions and [ __ ] vampires
and pedophiles run everything except the
[ __ ] up god you're such a hack you're
such a goddamn hack and the fact that he
brought up the Bible tells you
everything you need to know about what's
happening Alex Jones you're gonna bring
up the Bible you're gonna bring up the
Bible and then finally he says like
again as a matter of fact I know that
the CIA has been using those drugs to do
interdimensional communications the
thing that upset me most about this
segment from Alex Jones was actually the
like to dislike right on the video now
again if people are watching him and
they think it's some sort of performance
art and it's like tongue-in-cheek and
like this is awesome he's attacking Joe
Rogan and they just like it okay fine I
guess
but if there are people who are watching
this and they're like no seriously he
nailed it then the level of idiocy
they're really surpasses what I thought
and it's not like I had a rosy view to
begin with but goodness gracious if
people watch this and they think that
this man is making coherent points as
opposed to being just a ranting raving
raging lunatic I have no words
boy oh boy do I have an interesting
story for all of you this got a lot of
press recently people were talking about
this non-stop so Sarah Huckabee Sanders
the press secretary tweeted this the
other day
last night I was told by the owner of
red hen in Lexington Virginia to leave
because I work for president Trump and I
politely left her actions say far more
about her than about me I always do my
best to treat people including those I
disagree with respectfully and will
continue to do so you know it's funny
that like as she's somewhat daxing this
restaurant in the tweet she's like I'm
trying to be respectful and then of
course you know this restaurant received
death threats and things of that nature
and they got yelp bombed where everybody
was like boo was restaurant ever boo boo
so when this story broke I was I took a
step back and I wanted to look at like
all the discourse that unfolded around
it and you know the general take of
people that I follow on Twitter versus
what the mainstream media was saying
versus whatever consensus might be out
there on it and I I have to say I was
looking for an argument that somebody
would make that I would be like that's
the one that's the one that swayed me in
one direction or another because usually
when you know we talk about any
political issue
I try to evaluate everything and then
you know come to my own conclusion but
oftentimes you'll have like in aha
moment with a certain argument that just
jives well with you know what you're
thinking is but I wasn't able to find
any of those arguments on this story in
fact the more I read people's takes the
more pissed off I got because it seemed
to me like everybody was being really
reflexive and dismissing dismissive and
annoying so the left wing position the
predominant left wing position seems to
be yeah [ __ ] who cares
let the restaurant do whatever they want
to do and aren't these conservative
hypocrites because they're in favor of
allowing restaurants to discriminate
against gays but now when a restaurant
owner wants to discriminate against
Sarah Huckabee Sanders all the sudden
discrimination is bad
that's the left-wing take the right-wing
take and you know ben shapiro tweeted
about this and many others have pointed
it out they say isn't it funny how you
know the left argues for against
discrimination when it comes to gay
people when it comes to race but then
all of a sudden when there's you know
discrimination against sarah Huckabee
Sanders discrimination against
conservatives now all of a sudden
they're in favor of discrimination so
it's interesting because you have both
sides pointing out the hypocrisy of the
other side while at the same time being
an equal and opposite hypocrite in some
respects now here's the thing is you
know discriminating against gays
analogous to discriminating against
Sarah Huckabee Sanders or conservatives
or what-have-you
well legally speaking the answer is no
because the LGBTQ community or you know
somebody race or gender those things are
protected classes under law which means
you know there's been a record a history
of discrimination against those people
so there's their protected class because
they're usually discriminating against
them any instances so it's like okay
these people are protected where you
can't specifically deny service to these
people and the idea is these are
arbitrary characteristics that are out
of somebody's control so you can't just
like say I'm not going to serve you
because of something you have zero
control over whatsoever and you know the
argument is with political affiliation
that's not the case you do have control
over that and it is true political
affiliation is not a protected class and
you do have you know you can logically
change your mind on various political
issues so you have a choice in working
for president Truong being far-right
partaking in the lies that you do on a
daily basis so it's not the same
thing now I think that's true but at the
same time I also think there's a little
bit of a slippery slope here because I
try to imagine the situation reversed
every time I see one of these things and
the first thing that came to my mind was
okay look they're discriminating against
her because she's in the Trump
administration and she's a liar they're
correct that she's a liar they're
correct that the Trump administration is
doing hideous things however when you
really get down to the to the brass
tacks on this the reality is yeah they
are kind of saying you're a far-right
conservative you're a prominent
conservative that's why we're
discriminating against you
okay well flip that let's say there's a
DSA meeting in Mississippi and they go
to a restaurant and they're all wearing
their DSA shirts and the owners of
far-right Republican of the restaurant
and he says we don't serve your kind
here I don't know if I'm cool with that
are you guys cool and I again listen I
have a genuinely mixed take on this so
I'm asking these questions in all
sincerity I'm not like trying to do any
like Oh gotcha I'm presenting these
things as like genuine roadblocks in my
own mind because I can imagine
situations on both extremes of the
political spectrum where I pause and I
go well on this instance I lead more in
this direction on this instance I lean
more in that direction so you know I
think we've covered stories before of in
the deep south some business is saying
like we don't serve liberals or we don't
serve Democrats and if I'm not mistaken
my reaction in those stories was like
that's [ __ ] you should serve them
and the argument that's implied there is
political affiliation is it should be a
protected class at least to an extent
but then okay let's look at it in the
other extreme forget Sarah Huckabee
Sanders and I think the reason why this
one is questionable in my mind is
because it's almost like layers removed
from the worst atrocities like okay she
works for the Trump administration their
commanding many atrocities that's a
given but she's just a lawyer for them
so but let's take it to the extreme
Dick Cheney goes to a restaurant gets
kicked out because he's Dick Cheney and
he's a war criminal and he has blood on
his hands
when I hear that one I lean towards ya
fuck'em you should be able to be kicked
out he's a [ __ ] war criminal what I'm
supposed to cry because this guy can't
get his hands on a chicken pot pie
meanwhile [ __ ] over 200,000 innocent
civilians are dead directly because of
his actions give me a [ __ ] break and
also I think there is something to be
said it is possible that this kind of
tactic of like shaming in public
actually leads to to some extent the
reformation of these hideous policies if
every Trump official or forget Trump if
any administration official of any
monstrous administration was shamed in
public every time they went out in
public specifically because of the
actions they were taking well yeah that
does provide a massive incentive to not
do those terrible things don't break up
the families at the border don't do the
drone strikes that kill thousands of
innocent civilians don't do torture so
on and so forth so it's possible
theoretically that it actually does
provide a disincentive and it stops them
from acting in these terrible ways but
at the same time it's also that the
opposite is possible that and I've
noticed this recently now instead of the
conversation being about the horrific
atrocities of the Trump administration
which it was before when they were
talking about what's happening at the
border with the child separations and
with all that stuff now all of a sudden
the conversation switched to is it a
good thing or a bad thing that Sarah
Huckabee Sanders was rejected from the
restaurant and so now that's the
discussion and the spotlight was taken
off of oh my god look at these terrible
policies and now it's you know a back
and forth on civility if you will and so
again another aspect of the argument is
people and this remember I said how
everybody's arguments about this annoy
me the argument from like the mainstream
media is like of course she shouldn't be
kicked out of the restaurant because
whatever happened to civility and
decorum again I don't know what I
believe on this but I certainly if I
lean in favor of hey don't
kick her out it's certainly not because
of civility and decorum I don't give a
[ __ ] about civility and decorum in fact
in US politics we could use a hell of a
lot less civility and less decorum I
wish people would stand up and fight
against the worst atrocities of our
government and war crimes of our
government and if people stood up and
fought back if the Democrats elected
Democrats drop the civility and decorum
[ __ ] and they said hey you're a war
criminal you're a torturer Jena Haspel
should be in [ __ ] prison you know
they never bring up civility or decorum
in the context of Democratic
administrations and Republican
administrations drone striking innocent
civilians killing Americans with drones
without a [ __ ] trial keeping open CIA
black sites and torturing spying on
everybody in the [ __ ] country with
the NSA they never say whatever happened
to civility and not spying on your
fellow neighbor it's always in the
context of these petty like
disagreements that they bring it up so
to the extent that I might lean in favor
of don't kick her out it's certainly not
because of civility and decorum it's
more it would be more because of the
precedent it sets because the reality is
once you open the door to discriminating
based on political affiliation then it
is gonna be flipped back on the left now
let me be clear I'm not saying those
things are I'm not saying like DSA or
you know whatever far lefties are
substantively the equivalent of the
far-right that's not what I'm arguing at
all because obviously I think one side
is correct and the other side is just
frothing at the mouth mad and terrible
but it doesn't have to be substantively
the same thing for that to be the
dynamic at play here in other words it's
categorically the same thing so if you
say I'm okay with allowing
discrimination over political
affiliation what you're saying is I'm
okay with it happening to my side
whether or not you know that's what
you're admitting to because you don't
get to agree to the rules of the game
and then change them when they're
inconvenient so if you say I'm
okay with the discrimination for
political affiliation against the right
it's gonna happen against the left and
then you have no leg to stand on to try
to argue against it because then you
can't make a principled argument of like
oh you can do this this is out of bounds
you can't you know discriminate based on
political affiliation so I I genuinely
don't know what to believe about this I
think when I think of this dynamic being
flipped I'm uncomfortable with it you
know so we know the protected classes of
the protected classes and there
obviously should be anti-discrimination
protections for them okay that I know I
believe in terms of political
affiliation a mix as to whether or not
there should be you know protected
status for them because I'm afraid of
how it can and will be flip back on the
left and it already has been again I
think I remember covering stories where
in the deep south they say we don't
serve Democrats or we don't serve
liberals and I'm pretty sure my
commentary at the time was that's [ __ ]
up now I get it that in this instance
they say no it's not because she's a
conservative it's because she works for
the Trump administration and all hmm
but then I don't know every Trump
administration official is equally as
guilty as the worst members of the Trump
administration and it should be allowed
to just kick them out if you want you
know and then again when you get down to
the core of it really what it comes down
to is their ideology and I agree their
ideology is hideous and odious but
should should it be totally cool kick
out of a restaurant every racist okay
and then then race it racism aside
forget racist far-right person okay for
put far-right person aside
run-of-the-mill conservative Trump voter
you know because that's this that's the
the slippery slope and I don't know if
I'm cool with it but again at the same
time there's a chance it works in that
it like disincentivizes people in power
like if Henry Kissinger addiction II was
kicked out of a restaurant I don't know
if I if I could be against the rest
I would find it really hard to try to
disagree with the restaurant because
they're [ __ ] war criminals and they
have dead dead bodies on their hands
they're directly responsible for it
I guess Sarah Huckabee Sanders is a
little removed from the worst atrocities
and she's just the liar of the
administration which is a different
thing than actually having blood on your
hands so I don't know I don't know I
don't know what my take on it is
I pulled the I pulled my followers on
Twitter and it was 662 percent of you
said yeah it's okay to kick her out okay
but then again of what I would say to
those people is well now it's it's
you're okay with discriminating based on
political affiliation so now it's gonna
happen to the left and then I don't know
what counter-argument you can have when
that happens because you can't say when
it happens to the left I'm against
discriminating over political
affiliation because you're not you were
in favor of it for the right so it's
gonna happen to the left what are you
gonna say then I know you can say oh no
but the left stands for good things and
the right stands for bad things yeah I
agree with that but that doesn't change
the fact that it's categorically the
same thing to discriminate against on
the basis of political affiliation so I
mean I get I see where my audience is
coming from but I just don't know if I
agree with that cuz I feel like that's a
slippery slope and it's not a good idea
but at the same time it might actually
work to disincentivize some of these
atrocities so I don't know but listen I
just want to be crystal clear about one
thing I don't
I do think Sarah Huckabee Sanders is a
monster I do think the Trump
administration is hideous and I do think
that I do think what's at the heart of
what went down here is understandable
and reasonable in that they're taking a
stand and and they're saying enough
enough enough
like this isn't normal what's going on
in this country is not okay forget
normal put normal aside because
unfortunately many other administrations
have done terribly hideous things as
well but this is people saying we're
gonna fight back and we're not going to
sit down and take it anymore
and you don't get to rip families apart
and kill innocent
people and you know not have any
repercussions we're gonna give you those
repercussions so I don't know and also
by the way she's there I think they're
somewhat hypocritical too because Sarah
Huckabee Sanders herself was defending
the notion of you know allowing
restaurants to discriminate over sexual
orientation so okay well now you kind of
know what it feels like in a sense even
though it's not perfectly analogous it's
somewhat analogous so I don't know I
don't know what my take on this is I
think it's a very complex issue and I'm
just really annoyed with all the
reactionary reflexive flippant arrogant
dismissive takes on this that I've seen
where people are just like hardcore on
one side or the other and the other
thing that's [ __ ] frustrating is
virtually all of the commentary I see is
like some people trying to point out the
perceived hypocrisy of the other side
but then they never tell you what they
actually believe it's just like I look
at these conservatives in favor of
discrimination and against gays but not
against people they like ya hypocrites
and again on the other side same thing
look at these liberals against
discrimination but for it in this
instance and it's like okay you guys are
making a lot of noises about other side
bad but what do you actually believe
what's your standard on this what's your
thinking on this there's a lot less of
that and a lot more of just like I don't
know tribalism and team picking and then
like rationalizing working backwards
from that from that notion in your mind
that I'm on this team so I don't know
now since I've expressed my mixed
feelings please everybody don't hesitate
to absolutely smash that dislike button
a thousand times and give me a 50% like
and dislike rate
the insanely bloated military budget
just passed the Senate and nobody's
really talking about this I mean the the
immigration issue is really snagging the
entire news cycle I think that is an
issue that should be discussed a lot but
I do think that this military issue
should be discussed at least equally as
much because it's that important
so Washington Post says US military
budget inches closer to one trillion
dollar mark one trillion dollars as
concerns over federal deficit grow so
the the vote I hope you're sitting down
was 82 to 10 so what that means is the
same Democrats who oftentimes scream and
Yelp and [ __ ] and moan about how Donald
Trump is a lunatic Donald Trump is
thin-skinned Donald Trump is crazy
Donald Trump should not have access to
nuclear weapons because he's genuinely
unbalanced those same Democrats who make
that argument on Monday on Tuesday they
go oh and by the way let's give this guy
what about an eighty billion dollar
increase in his military budget are you
[ __ ] kidding me that's like taking
the genuinely unbalanced village
alcoholic and saying oh this guy has
major issues anyway let's go buy him an
arsenal that there's no logical
connection there there's no reason to do
that that's the opposite of what you
should be doing if he's such a danger
and by the way I think he is then you
should not only should you not be
increasing military budget you should be
decreasing it massively you can't give
this man an army you can't give this man
the ability to do whatever whenever
wherever and by the way a lot of these
Democrats were also in favor of Donald
Trump's illegal unconstitutional bombing
of Syria without a vote from Congress
Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi supported
that bombing oh my God he's so unhinged
he's so crazy he's so unbalanced and by
the way he should totally be bombing
people with no authority whatsoever it's
just we live in the
damn twilight zone and every time I have
to come out here and talk about this and
we're one of very few shows talking
about this and it's like CNN won't touch
it MSNBC they won't touch this and 82 to
10 only 10 people are against it I don't
even know I know Elizabeth Warren and
Bernie Sanders were on the proper side
of this I don't know who the other ones
were I know Rand Paul probably voted
against this military budget but I the
fact that 82 senators the overwhelming
majority of senators so most Democrats
were like yeah let's give him this it's
unbelievable man so this is the biggest
military budget since the height of the
Iraq war Donald Trump now has that so
what happened in response to this is
Bernie apparently has similar feelings
like I do and he thinks this is
outrageous and unbelievable and he took
to the floor of the Senate and he lashed
out seven hundred and sixteen billion
dollars at a time when in Louisiana as I
understand that they're not going to be
cutting food stamps for hungry children
where schools throughout this country
don't have enough money for books or for
teachers salaries we're talking about a
seven hundred and sixteen million
billion dollar military budget and this
process as I understand it will allow
for no amendments despite the fact that
I think virtually every member of the
Senate has concerns about this bill you
know mr. president over and over again I
have heard my Republican colleagues and
a number of Democratic colleagues come
to the floor and talk about a very
serious issue and that is the 21
trillion dollar national debt that we
are leaving our kids and our
grandchildren
but somehow when it comes to giving huge
tax breaks trillion dollars in
tax breaks to the top 1% suddenly we
don't hear much about that national debt
and when it comes to spending 716
billion dollars on a defense bill my
Republican friends are mute suddenly the
debt has disappeared because it's okay
to spend unlimited sums of money on the
military the president I have heard my
Republican colleagues tell us that the
United States just cannot afford to join
the rest of the industrialized world
every other major country and guarantee
health care to all of our people as a
right to a Medicare for all program to
what the American people want but I'm
told we cannot afford that 716 billion
dollars in one year for the military we
can't afford but health care for our
children and for our working people and
for the 30 million people who have no
health insurance and the tens of
millions of people cannot afford health
insurance that we cannot afford it's the
president at the moment that we are
engaged in a highly competitive global
economy I am told over and over again
that we cannot afford to make public
colleges and universities tuition-free
hundreds of thousands of our young
people are unable to go to college
because the families lack the income
millions leave school deeply in debt oh
no no we cannot afford to make public
colleges and universities tuition-free
but we can afford to spend seven hundred
and sixteen billion dollars in one year
on the military mr. president over half
of older Americans have no retirement
savings no retirement savings and yet I
got Republican colleagues in the house
and here in the Senate to say oh we
can't afford Social Security we got to
cut Social Security for people are
trying to get by on 1213
$18,000 are you cutting their
prescription drugs that have cut Social
Security yes but think about dealing
with the 716 billion dollar military
budget in a rational way no no no we
can't afford to do that we can't even
accept amendments here on the floor mr.
president the time is long overdue for
us to take a hard look at the enormous
amount of waste that the cost overruns
at the fraud and at the financial
mismanagement that has plagued the
Department of Defense for decades I've
heard many of my Republican colleagues
worried about that low-income people are
taking advantage of this program with
that program well you know where the
money is the money is at the Department
of Defense and it may be time that we
took a hard look at the fraud in the
financial mismanagement that exists
there and that is why I am offering a
bipartisan amendment I want to thank
senators Grassley and Lee for their
support on this amendment to end the
absurdity of the Department of Defense
being the only federal agency that has
not undergone and audited mr. president
it will not surprise you to note that
according to a Gallup poll in February a
few months ago 65 percent of the
American people opposed spending more
money on the Department of Defense
sixty-five percent say we should not
spend more money and yet over a two-year
period we're gonna spend some hundred
and sixty five billion more on the
defense so it shouldn't shock anybody
that what happens here is a direct
contradiction to what the American
people want Bernie goes on for about 25
minutes and he just keeps lashing out at
the military-industrial complex I love
this idea of auditing the Department of
Defense I mean we know what we're gonna
find is tar ilion's of dollars of waste
fraud and abuse and we know that because
we've seen the reports specifically for
the Iraq war in the Afghanistan war and
what happened was trillions of dollars
of waste fraud and abuse so you know
that's one of the reasons why the Iraq
war it's projected that by the year 2050
three it will cost seven trillion
dollars a lot of that is because we have
to pay the the interest because we
borrowed money to for the war and a lot
of it's because there was waste fraud
and abuse with a lot of these private
contractors that we didn't know bid
contracts and they can't account for a
lot of stuff man so it's just an endless
money pit that's what it is for the
military and you're not allowed to
question that because if you question
that you're unpatriotic and you don't
support our troops and you don't support
America they immediately tar you with
the same [ __ ] they put on people who
kneel during the national anthem why do
you hate America why do you hate America
oh you're not strong on national defense
you didn't vote for this this military
budget why do you hate our troops you're
not strong on military so then they'll
try to paint you as a terrorist
sympathizer if you do that and the thing
that drives me crazy is the things
Bernie Sanders is saying here it's it's
common sense I mean look you can see
here look at how much more money we
spend in every other country when it
comes to the military I mean you could
cut the US military budget in half and
we'd still have the biggest military in
the world by a mile and a half so I mean
come on man he's pointing out obvious
stuff yes we should audit the Department
of Defense yes we should at least cut
our military spending in half and we'd
still have the biggest military and we'd
still be the world's sole superpower and
you'd you know you would stop a lot of
the unnecessary harm that we actively
cause around the world if you did that
and he goes through a list there he says
okay
so let me get this straight people want
to cut Social Security s what the
Republican politicians want to do they
want to cut food stamps they want to cut
education they just did tax cuts for the
rich that's gonna add over a trillion
dollars to the deficit they say we can't
have health care for everybody we can't
have college for everybody but yeah you
want to do an 80 to 100 billion dollar
increase in military spending over a
single year fine I love that did you
know that just the increase in the
military budget okay so not the total
military budget just the increase from
last year to this year in military
spending is enough to fund free college
for everybody and still have about ten
billion dollars left over see that right
there that fact right there immediately
blows up all of the [ __ ] myths about
oh my god the dead the deficit we can't
what are we supposed to do we can't
afford [ __ ] health care we can't
afford college but we can't afford
something that's more expensive than
that which is urgently not needed which
is more money for our defensive budget
really it's an offensive budget for our
nine hundred military bases around the
world for our bombing of eight different
countries for our two full-scale wars
that are going on right this second so
it's like we live in the twilight zone
and Bernie Sanders is one of just a
handful of sane people left in the world
and again the crazy thing is Washington
is unique in this because he just cited
the number what was it 65 percent of
Americans don't want to spend more on
the military so Bernie's representing
the overwhelming majority the American
people which means in Washington the
vote was 82 to 10 in favor of this
gargantuan disgusting toxic grotesque
criminal military budget 82 to 10 82 to
10 in favor of it so that goes to show
you yes you want to talk about the
[ __ ] swamp there you go Donald Trump
there's the swamp but no he's part of
the swamp because Donald Trump is gonna
sign this with a goddamn smile on his
face then he's gonna hit the campaign
trail and brag about it and talk about
how all we have to cut all the programs
for you but oh my god we just had made
the military strong again we made it
great again meanwhile under Obama the
military budget was exploding as well it
was too high back then but they act like
aw it's depleted it was depleted and I
just made it be even better how's that
look to you does that look reasonable
does that look sane in a country that
has an infrastructure that gets a grade
of D plus [ __ ] Flint Michigan doesn't
even have clean water and they're not
the only one there's a lot of places
around the country that don't have clean
water over 70% in fact according to one
poll 80% of Americans live paycheck to
paycheck but this is cool but that's
cool right there it makes no [ __ ]
sense and more people need to start
saying it you need to start saying it
you need to tell everybody you [ __ ]
know about the reality of our military
budget and how the American people are
getting hosed the American people are
getting screwed the American people are
getting bamboozled why because the
military-industrial complex
so defense companies Raytheon Boeing and
the like Honeywell what they do is they
give money to the politicians for their
campaigns and so when they get elected
oh I got to pay back the people who put
me in office by giving me all the money
so endless military budgets as far as
the eye can see we got thousands of
tanks sitting in the Nevada desert right
now thousands of them thousands of them
why why do you think corruption
corruption we got to make more money and
we got to keep the jobs tied to the
[ __ ] endless military-industrial
complex and war is profit for the US we
don't it doesn't have to be like that
doesn't have to be like that at all we
could totally rewire our economy we can
have a green technology renewable energy
revolution we could have great jobs tied
to that we could have great jobs tied to
the rebuilding of our infrastructure but
no we have a permanent warfare economy
and at the same time they spend more
money on needless suffering and death
they say we got to cut grandma's Social
Security should we gotta increase the
prices of her medication sorry we can't
do anything about student loan debt
sorry we can't give everybody healthcare
sorry food stamps and a little too much
to ask to be able to pay for kids who
are hungry that we got to cut all day
long but we got plenty of money for the
military baby and if you disagree with
it why do you love the terrorists we
live in we live in what seems like a
shitty movie with facts on the ground
that are almost too too unbelievable to
mention it's almost like if you didn't
know all these facts and somebody just
told you this for the first time if
you're just learning about this now you
almost don't believe me you're almost
like come on this is really how it is
this how it is man this is how it is
because again in a movie if they had
these facts they the immediate response
would be people wouldn't accept that
they'd say no we can't have it like that
that's what it's like right now but
there's this massive effort to try to
pull the wool over your eyes to get you
to be passive and not give a [ __ ] about
stuff like this that's what's going on
so now you know and you should spread
the word as far as you can and we got a
like Bernie Sanders our next president
so we could at least start to untangle
some of the grotesque [ __ ] that's
been happening with our money in our
name
so Kyle were super super excited to have
you on Kyle kolinsky host of secular
talk you've been someone that I've been
following for years now you are one of
the best people out there cutting
through the partisan lines Kyle thanks
for coming out Media roots radio no it's
my pleasure and the feeling is mutual
I've been a fan of yours too for a long
time awesome well you have this hugely
successful YouTube channel you have a
very loyal fan base which really does
seem increasingly difficult with this
influx of information and also in just
the saturation of media content so
before we get started how did you get
started covering politics and develop
your show uh let's see
so I started secular talk in 2008 I did
it as a hobby I was 20 years old at the
time I would just upload you know a
video every now and then it was usually
you know somewhat political related or
like religion related I think one of my
first videos was actually on Glenn Beck
if I remember correctly and I think
around 2010 so two years later I started
doing a radio show on BlogTalkRadio and
after a while and I went to college got
a political science degree and then
after awhile I kind of like decided to
sync the two together in a way so I
would record a live radio show and then
later on you chopped up the radio show
into little video segments and then you
upload it on the YouTube channel and
come 2012 I believe it was I started
doing I tried to do secular talk
full-time and you know I got kind of
lucky in a sense because it took off and
I guess it was just right place right
time kind of thing and you know I was
able to make it work in the long run but
that's that's the general story I
started out start out kind of as a hobby
and then decided to kind of saturate the
market in a way when I did a full-time I
was like I'm gonna do this full
full-time I'm really gonna go balls to
the wall I'm gonna upload like as many
videos as possible and been doing that
ever since nice
we were lonely the only people Kyle I
remember I mean its he seemed like there
was a there was a rather large void like
even on places like YouTube back then
going back to like 2008 where I don't
remember very very many people putting
out the kind of commentary you were
besides maybe the Young Turks at the
time so yeah I mean you were do I mean
some extremely valuable stuff there
wasn't really anybody I mean there were
other people but I really remember I
mean you but you've been doing this for
a long time and since then there's been
a lot of other people who sort of come
into the fray but what I really
appreciate about your work is that you
you stick to your principles and I know
that sounds like maybe a low bar of some
kind but it's not because a lot of
people haven't in this area and I feel
that you have sort of stuck to your guns
and remained very progressive even as
you put an enormous amounts of fire
towards the Democrats rightfully caught
Hillary Clinton you know and other
figures in that movement where I feel
like other people have maybe gotten a
little too obsessed with that and
haven't been going after Trump but you
you do go after Trump at the same time
so I just want to say that I really
appreciate that well thank you I really
appreciate you saying that
I I mean I try I feel like it's very it
just gets very boring and stale and
hacky to just be a partisan tribalist
and it's not entertaining it's not
intelligent it's just like okay if you
really want to see partisan hacks you
could turn on Fox News you could turn on
MSNBC like you have your outlets for
partisan hackery
so for me it's more about you know
reading the news finding it you know
picking one I find interesting and then
basically having giving the facts and
then having my perspective and sticking
to it no matter where the conclusions
take me and yeah I mean sometimes it
comes across as as I don't know the
right word for it I don't want to I
don't want to suck my own dick here but
revolutionary in a way to just talk
about
you know kind of stick to your guns even
when even when you might make your own
audience upset by it so I try to do that
I try to not be a partisan hack and I
try to stick to my principles and just
kind of give everybody my you know non
interventionist Democratic Socialist
view on things yeah and in the name your
channel is secular talk and I remember
one of the first things I noticed about
that was I kind of almost mistakenly
thought you might be like a new atheist
when I first saw the title of your show
so explain how did a theism drive your
politics and what and and just the
difference between your atheism and and
correct me if I'm wrong on that I'm
assuming you're an atheist but the
difference between that and what you're
sort of your atheism and people like
Richard Dawkins and sam Harris were sort
of taking over the new atheist movement
sure so there's sort of like an
interesting backstory to this I I don't
know how old I was at the time I was
pretty young I was in my teens but I
basically started reading like I read
all of those new atheist books whether
it be you know Sam Harris the end of
faith or letter to a Christian nation or
Richard Dawkins The God Delusion or
Christopher Hitchens I read that pretty
much at the same time that I was reading
noam chomsky and when I started reading
like Noam Chomsky books and so yeah the
whole idea behind secular talk it was
almost like an attempt to kind of bring
together in atheist and secular
philosophy along with you know a
progressive leftist worldview so you're
right and in bringing up like the name
of the channel it seems like it's got
it's kind of it kind of has like a new
atheist II feel to it and you know at
the time when I launched it I kind of
considered myself like a half half a
Richard Dawkins type character and half
like a you know like a noam chomsky
character so there were definitely I was
definitely influenced by all of those
people that you just named but of course
what's interesting is that over
time you know there's been pretty much a
bigger and bigger rift within those two
communities you know what I mean and
yeah they've seems God I want to jump in
here really quickly because it seems it
is really interesting that you came from
both of those worlds because to me it
seems like the biggest problem with Sam
Harris and the arguments that he puts
forward is its to who based on science
and data and not anthropological or
scientific in a sense or not Chomsky
esque in a sense where he's looking at
the you know the context or the growth
of these cultures like how you know you
can't just look at statistics and data
alone and say this is the answer to
everything you have to look at how this
data came to be so it's just an
interesting mix that you came from both
those worlds but what do you think about
just that kind of line of thinking of
the Richard Dawkins and sam Harris where
you know Islam is the ultimate evil and
you know our our morality and and our
into it our intent is really ultimately
what matters most well that's kind of
what led me to ultimately be
significantly more in the Noam Chomsky
camp then you know the bat camp is that
they their analysis is not really
sophisticated and you know I had I
actually spoke on my channel to Sam
Harris and I remember really trying to
get to the brass tacks of what his
beliefs are when it comes to foreign
policy and I just remember basically his
only point that he kept reiterating in
different ways is that well listen if
Dick Cheney had his druthers he would
want to make Iraq like in Nebraska like
that's what he kind of kept saying over
and over and I thought like what a silly
like that's just such a ridiculous way
of viewing the world it's almost like
you can just brush aside all of the
crimes committed by US Empire and and
just kind of say well listen they I
guess he means kind of well therefore
you can't really look at us like we're
the bad guy but of course if you go to
the evidence and this is something Noam
Chomsky does better than anybody else
you find out very quickly we do what we
do around the world for natural
resources for money for power and the
idea that on any level we're concerned
about altruism or human rights or being
the world world police is honestly
laughable I mean our top allies Israel
is an apartheid state you know
Saudi Arabia is an absolute theocracy
and a dictatorship the idea that like
you can look at the way the United
States acts and think well no I mean we
kind of mean well that's just factually
wrong and you know over time I saw the
bigger rift in the eat the bigger rifts
in these two communities and you know I
mean Sam Harris you want to talk about
going off the deep end as soon as you
started being like open to the idea of a
race science like with the whole charles
murray thing if you're feuding with ezra
klein something is wrong with you that
guys like the most milquetoast
neoliberal on the planet you know what i
mean and you're he's trying to make it
seem like Ezra Klein is unreasonable
because he doesn't agree with charles
murray or he's not open to charles
Murray's ideas and the fact of the
matter is any serious intellectual or
academic it doesn't it's not that hard
to see that what charles murray is doing
you know it's like a ver it's barely
trying to mask his bigotry and his
racism with his work so the fact that
you know harris kind of lumped him into
the like oh no he's just not being
politically correct like no it's not
that something is you know factually
wrong about the stuff he's pushing and
it's not that it's a dangerous path that
he goes down it's that yeah he's just
not politically correct when he talks
about race science and when he says like
hey maybe we should totally cut the
social safety net because we can't help
those poor minority communities anyway
so yeah over time i have seen how far
off the rails you know somebody like sam
harris has gone and ultimately why I
find myself signal
Gilmore in agreement with a guy like
Noam Chomsky the thing is hilarious
because they act like it's this
forbidden knowledge that's been you know
a pushback from society because it's in
politically incorrect Matt oh it's been
debunked by scientific circles that's
why it's been pushed down and that's why
it's forbidden because it literally is a
debuff on hope science and Ezra Klein
presented that to Sam Harris in like the
kindest way you know what I mean almost
like holding his hand and walking him
down the path of life ain't a little too
hard to be like yes being very
conciliatory and very much like a man
listen I'm a fan of you like I like you
like I'm not saying like you think I'm
being overly critical erect what the
hell is that
it sounded like wind chimes I was like
what's happening yeah so Ezra Klein I
mean he was really bending over
backwards to be really nice about it to
Sam Harris and it's almost like Sam
Harris couldn't help but go to the same
thing he says over and over whenever he
is in a position like this which is like
you know he plays the victim you know oh
I'm being taken out of context I'm being
misrepresented it's like stop you're
such a whiny baby just like you know
what point am I not taking you out of
context exactly exactly I'm not sure
he's ever you know engaged in a major
disagreement with somebody and not
walked away saying I'm being taken out
of context
and you're misrepresenting me it happens
every single time and it doesn't matter
how much like when I had that talk with
Sam Harris well on my channel a long
time ago I was really trying to stress
to him like listen dude I'm not your
enemy like I've read your work I liked a
lot of it but I was giving I was
presenting genuine questions that I was
interested in his answers about foreign
policy for example and but he had this
shield up the entire time and basically
started the conversation by berating me
for even bothering to speak to somebody
like Glenn Greenwald he went he went out
of his way to say Glenn Greenwald is not
even a journalist it was he
as a Pulitzer like wow who says that I
mean what a ridiculous thing to say
that's crazy yeah that's um that that's
a really funny Kyle and I I actually
forgot that you had Sam Harris on your
show and that's sort of fascinating that
he would berate you because you would
think as someone with the name of your
show secular talk who you know knows
that you've read his books would be more
kinder or just like you know Trudeau
most convince you he was coming from but
it sound sounds like he used the most I
mean by basically saying that Oh Dick
Cheney would have turned in Iraq into
Nebraska so he meant well it's almost I
mean it's almost cartoon and it's just
saying well Thanos meant well because
the reason he wanted to kill half the
universe is to make the universe better
it's like I mean it's that it's almost
that ridiculous yeah and it's also you
know the idea of like and he does this
with stuff like torture like well
theoretically are there any possible
circumstances where maybe we should
engage in it in order to save more lives
and it's like well do you not realize
how these things are actually
empirically used forget about
theoretically look at empirically how
it's used I mean we tortured people at
Abu Ghraib we torture people at
Guantanamo Bay and when more and more
information came out and the more we
learned the more it was crystal clear
we were torturing innocent people I mean
we're talking about Bush and Cheney
cut a deal with Afghan warlords and
Pakistani warlords after 9/11 and told
them hey listen you send us people who
are jihadists because we got attacked on
9/11 and we want to get them back
basically and then guess what guys it
turns out warlords from Afghanistan and
Pakistan are not that trustworthy
because what they did is they rounded up
their political opponents and they sent
them to us so I mean most of the more
dark-skinned you know Arabs because a
lot of those people that we worked with
where we're not so like a lot of the
people ended up just you know it's like
oh they you know they look like they
look Arab or they look like jihadis oh
yeah it's because like Dick Cheney
standing there like you know going
through evidence to figure out whether
or not this is some
who we should really be holding no I
mean we didn't give these people due
process and this by the way this is just
like a clear example as to why due
process is really not debatable it's
non-negotiable you need to have due
process to make sure in any circumstance
that the government actually gets it
right you know what I mean but also the
fact that we did torture it'd be bad
enough if we tortured and we did torture
people who were terrorists cuz that's
still not okay but we did it and the
people were freaking innocent you know
so the idea that like you can
intellectualize and theorize about these
this stuff when the empirical evidence
points to the fact that we've become the
monsters that we're trying to avoid
I mean that's the thing I was never able
to get over with with the guy with a guy
like Harris it's like it's so flippant
and dismissive about when we do [ __ ]
up stuff you know what I mean and just
kind of brushing it under the rug as
well I guess we mean well and we have
good intentions and that's just a
terrible misreading of the situation
it's massively unimpaired Cole and it's
laughable yeah and also just that
everyone thinks that they everyone means
well I mean it's really really insulting
to say that you know okay to them they
are doing the right thing right I mean
every group means well and according to
their beliefs in philosophy and the way
that they grew up and and whatever their
cause is so I just find it really
bizarre this American exceptionalism and
basically Empire baby syndrome I like to
call it these people are Empire babies
they can't see outside of their own like
entitlement and also Abby I like to call
it American supremacism because that's
effectively what it is everybody uses
the term American exceptionalism and for
whatever reason that that has like a
more benign ring to it but really
another word for exceptional is supreme
so we're talking about American
supremacism and that but that basically
means I mean we're a nation that life
loves to talk about equality like oh
everybody's equal under the law but
what's hilarious is at the same time
that people talk about equality they'll
they'll believe in American
exceptionalism which is like well no
it's one or the other either you believe
everybody's equal or you believe right
America
above and better than every other nation
yeah and then to go over the Sam Harris
thing it's like you uh you're honestly
like you know you claim you're an
atheist and so these notions of like
evil and good are laughable and
cartoonish yet you by default are almost
like bull leaping in the concept of evil
because you're saying that you know your
other rising and dehumanizing these
groups of people that you're like well
they mean bad we mean good therefore we
can carry out these mass atrocities on
these other people who obviously don't
have good intentions I mean it's just
insulting yeah ha he lives he loves to
bring to bring up that intentions point
and he loves to say you know like hey
well if we don't mean bad then you can't
put us in the same moral category as
actual monsters who mean bad and my
response to that is this let's say
somebody leaves their house to go to
school or to go to work on a Monday and
they run over somebody with their car
totally by accident they didn't mean to
do it but it happened okay
now yes it is true that under the law we
have a different category for that
that's technically not murder that's a
manslaughter right but what if that same
person left their house on Tuesday and
ran over to people again what if they
left their house on Wednesday and ran
over another six people what if they
left their house on Thursday and ran
over 20 people what if they left their
house on Friday and ran over 27 more
people that is the United States Empire
right there the idea like well I mean
look we don't really mean bad but sure
we increased drone strikes by 432
percent in the last year and we've
killed thousands of civilians and you
know the list goes on and on we're
bombing 8 countries right now we have
two full-scale wars going on in Iraq and
Afghanistan and and we could talk about
this stuff all day the fact of the
matter is when that body count keeps
taking up it's not a matter of brushing
all that under the rug and going yep I
mean it's we mean well it's better to
have us is the world leader than
everybody else
it's like no have some frickin
principles you need to have a principled
stance against something like torture a
principled stance against something like
waging offensive Wars
against countries that didn't attack us
this stuff isn't that difficult but you
dave rubin went on Joe Rogan's podcast
and they went back and forth on the
issue of regulation this is interesting
let's watch and then I have a bunch of
stuff I want to say what problem would
you everything you're building here
right now right do you want the
government to tell you how to do all
these things and all the regulations
that you got to have your electric thing
this far from this and like all the
regulations like that for construction
are important though you do have to make
sure that people don't do stupid [ __ ]
but machinery of a power lines near a
water line yeah there's a lot of but I
would put most of that on the builders
though they want to build things that
are good now I get how all that's not
true
listen people know people are gonna
corners all the time like you have to
have regulations when it comes to
construction methods or people are gonna
get [ __ ] they cut regulate they cut
corners when there are regulations
anyway they do they would cut a lot more
if there weren't regular I'm not totally
the third world countries and look at
construction methods they're [ __ ]
dangerous yeah that's why schools
collapse on kids in foreign countries
sometimes like well I'm not complete I'm
not telling you that I'm against all
regulation period that's where but
that's where I said intellectually I
like that argument because you could
make us I think you can make a very
sound argument that competition would
force people to do better work like if
you're a plumber you have a vested
interest in doing the best plumbing job
you can so that people will rate you on
Yelp so that you will get more work you
don't have a vested interest in cutting
corners now you might write you're gonna
push it as much as you can to save as
much time and energy and money as you
can but once you go over that edge yeah
you don't want to be known as the guy
that the you tighten something too much
so that you flooded the house or when
you're building and you're thinking
logically though when when people [ __ ]
things up and short things and do things
terrible they're not thinking logically
but I don't think it's generous I don't
think it's the government that they're
like the government gave me this
regulation so that's why I'm gonna do it
right well if you didn't have any
regulations there'd be no incentive
whatsoever to do it right there would be
an incentive Spector's no one was gonna
check their stuff and make sure that
their stuff was up to code listen man I
was in the structure in my whole life my
dad's an architect
yeah been in construction since I was a
little kid you [ __ ] need regulations
these guys a lot of people that are in
construction they're they'll do whatever
the [ __ ] they can to make
and it's not good for the people that
have the house because they might have
that house for five ten years before
that problem manifests itself the the
people who were establishing these codes
are licensed builders or people that
have been involved in construction for a
long [ __ ] time and they know what's
safe and what's not safe that's why
those codes exist they exist to protect
the consumers you can't just protect the
consumers through the marketplace
because so I'm not calling for time for
these problems to become a real issue
and these problems could potentially
damage everybody in the neighborhood
it's not just gonna affect the person on
this one lot like of a fire starts it
burns all the houses in the neighborhood
or if a flood happens and it floods
everyone downhill it's a real problem
absolutely real careful with
construction I get it and you know my
dad wasn't in construction so I'm not
privy to like all of that the little
stuff but I genuinely believe that as a
general level people have a vested
interest in especially now because of
phones and apps and Yelp and all these
doing good work because that's how you
will get more work you're never gonna
remove the people who will do shoddy
shitty malicious [ __ ] but you can keep
them a bay with regulation but what is
like what's the solution if someone
pollutes if you're not gonna have
regulation what is the solution if
someone does something that's illegal
well if you're not gonna have a
regulation it wouldn't be illegal but
your question is well it's illegal to
dump things into the river right I mean
it's just that's not a matter of
regulation
I mean polluting willful poisoning of
rivers I'm sure he's actually terrorism
right yeah it would be a bunch of like
so what those guys would argue is what I
said before which is that ultimately
especially now because of technology
like in the old days so like every time
someone cuts a regulation I've heard
Bill Maher say this a lot they're gonna
start polluting the river immediately
that implies that these businessmen
whatever they're you know whether
whatever they're whatever industry that
they're in that they're immediately
gonna be like hah the regulations gon
start polluting the water we live in a
time now where everyone's walking around
with an iPhone where maybe fifty years
ago you could have got away with a lot
of bad [ __ ] right
coal miners that were breathing all
kinds of horrible [ __ ] that nobody was
ever gonna find out about where now
everybody is walking around with snap
Chadd and Instagram and blah blah blah
so a lot of the stuff would be exposed
more so that all of the things that
we've been talking about for the last
couple hours about about people getting
involved a lot of the things I think
would start self-regulating but again
and then I won't say it again I'm not
for just deregulating everything I just
think there's probably better ways to do
it than just having the government come
in and say this is what you got to do
and now figure it out because the
government isn't that good at most
things I like how the entire time he's
arguing for deregulation and then when
Joe Rogan's like listen that makes
absolutely no sense and here's why he
pivots to no I'm now I'm not calling for
getting rid of all these regulations and
then he proceeds to continue to make the
argument to get rid of all regulations
so he's trying to have it both ways he's
trying to give himself the wiggle room
to say okay if this is coming across
really stupid then I don't I don't mean
it literally but at the same time I'm
gonna go ahead and make these arguments
where the conclusion of the points on
making its let's not have regulations so
it's just it's really slimy and those
are there are a lot of bad points there
so let's go through it
the idea that Oh iPhones or Yelp will
somehow be sufficient in making sure
that corporations don't cut corners I
mean that's that's almost so silly as to
not merit comment I mean do we have to
go through the thousands of examples of
yes even the media which is it's a lot
more than just an iPhone video going
viral right like the mainstream media
apparatus going oh [ __ ]
look at what happened with GE polluting
the Hudson River and even that that's
not enough to get them to do the right
thing you need the government to step in
and say listen if you don't do the right
thing then there's gonna be a giant
penalty here so and that's the point is
Dave Rubin acts like a guy who's 14
years old who just read
his first ein ran book and like
instantly agreed with all of it and
thought like oh this is brilliant I
never heard of this before I guess greed
might be good and dude you're a
grown-ass man you're not 14 years old
anymore listen up I'll be totally
upfront with you guys when I was in my
early teens yeah I read some mine ran
books and I I was somewhat convinced by
them and I was like oh [ __ ] this is
interesting I never thought of it in
this way but then you grow out of that
phase when you realize that the
overwhelming weight of the empirical
evidence is in the opposite direction
see that's the thing libertarians and
anarcho-capitalists they have the all
these theories like well if this if this
happens then
this is the way that people will react
in the marketplace but it turns out that
the evidence is the exact opposite it's
so it's not true if you get rid of the
regulations everything basically self
regulates and it works out that it is
just objectively empirically false when
you look at the actual data and you and
when you look at the historical record
so let me give some examples
glass-steagall this is a perfect example
now that was repealed by Bill Clinton
what did glass-steagall do
glass-steagall was a separation of
commercial banking and investment
banking by law so it's a regulation that
effectively said this when you go to the
bank and you put your money in the bank
you have an expectation that okay I'm
giving it to this well-known institution
you know whatever JPMorgan Chase you you
name it and there's this understanding
there's this implicit agreement of I'm
gonna put my money in this Bank and it's
safe there it's safe there
and the reason you you assumed hey it's
gonna be safe is because there were
rules in place that said commercial
banks cannot take your money and do
casino capitalist bets with it there are
really really high risk bets and anybody
who's a gambler will tell you if you
make these high-risk bets long enough of
course they're gonna explode and blow up
and you're gonna lose all your [ __ ]
money so they were doing puts and calls
and all these insane
financial tricks and derivatives bets
and things of that nature with your
money when you just go to your local
bank and put your money in there well
guess what that's a recipe for an
economic meltdown so we had this
regulation in place this rule in place
where they said no if you do if you put
your money in the in your local bank
they have to by law do safe investments
with that they can't do the really high
risk casino capitalist investments
because that'll blow up see what happens
Dave is that people especially at these
financial institutions they always work
for their short-term benefit and making
a lot of money quickly as opposed to
doing safe investments and maybe making
a little bit of money over an extended
period of time
see that's the thing it's not that the
guys on Wall Street are the smartest
guys in the room they're the greediest
guys in the room and the evidence of
that is what happened with the subprime
mortgage crisis and the Great Recession
and he also floats later on in this clip
like oh well can't we just privatize
some of the regulations so here's a good
example of something along those lines
we had ratings agencies that you know
you've heard of the ratings agencies
before there's a few of them and weird
it turned out that they were rating
these subprime mortgage packages
triple-a now how could that happen how
could that happen that they're rating
the subprime mortgage packages triple-a
when it turns out they were uttered dog
[ __ ] and they led to a financial
implosion well you have a giant conflict
of interest when the companies that hold
those toxic subprime mortgage packages
are paying the ratings agencies to give
them the rating when Wall Street firms
paid ratings agencies they just said
whatever the Wall Street firms wanted
them to say so if you make it a private
company far from being a cure-all it's
the exact opposite
exact opposite what happens is there's a
giant conflict of interest and they're
all in on the game and they're all
trying to make money in the short run
and damn the long-term consequences
because it's not gonna affect me see
what they did with these subprime
mortgage packages they played hot potato
so they're ranked triple-a even though
that's [ __ ]
one company takes them in and they go oh
[ __ ] these are actually this is [ __ ]
and then they sell it off to another
company and then they sell it off to
another company on the books everybody's
making a tremendous amount of money but
really these mortgages are gonna implode
because people are not gonna be able to
pay to pay them they're gonna default on
their loans very quickly as soon as the
adjustable rate kicks in so the only way
to address that is through government
regulation the only way to address GE
polluting the water because they saved
money if they polluted the river they
saved money to dispose of the toxic
waste in a legitimate way costs a lot of
[ __ ] money and they're not gonna cut
into their [ __ ] profit margin
willingly they're not gonna do that
because who cares it's just a river it's
not gonna affect me it's gonna affect
whoever's down you know down there
the FDA take the FDA for example so
there are far fewer instances of
pharmaceutical drugs not working why
because they are FDA regulated and they
have to go through extensive testing and
verification now on the flip side there
are countless examples of supplements
like you go to you go to Vitamin Shoppe
for example a lot of the [ __ ] there
probably way more than half of the [ __ ]
there is just [ __ ] it just doesn't
work but it doesn't work in the sense
that there's no evidence for the
products in the first place but on top
of that a lot of the times they have
these capsules that are just filled with
like soy powder but they say a whole
bunch of other stuff on the label so how
the [ __ ] can they get away with selling
a product that isn't even what it says
on the label because they're not FDA
regulated if they were FDA regulated the
FDA could look at it and say oh this is
[ __ ] and you're selling snake oil so
now you have to sell the right thing or
we're gonna stop you from selling
anything that's the way
this stuff works I mean the idea that we
have to make a case to you know have a
police officer on the beat which is what
this is effectively and the
counter-argument is like no it'll all
work itself out the [ __ ] you talking
about there was a scandal where because
of a lack of regulation people were
selling rat meat and saying it was
chicken well what is the what's the only
way to fix that to have government
regulators go oh [ __ ] you're lying now
dave rubin might counter argue
yeah but then eventually people will
learn it's rat meat and then they'll
tell them hey don't go to that vendor
because that'll you know that they suck
and they're selling rat meat and saying
it's chicken but Dave how many people
have to [ __ ] eat the rat before you
get to that point a lot of people are
gonna have to eat the rat now aren't
they
one of the reasons we know as a matter
of fact that regulation works is there
was a massive period of deregulation on
the lead-up to the Great Depression
now during the Great Depression one of
the things that happened was FDR
put into place massive regulations of
Wall Street to try to prevent another
economic crash and then we had decades
of sustained growth and the next big
downturn we had was after the neoliberal
period when they brought back the
deregulation because when you have
deregulation and tax cuts for the rich
well you have are what's called boom
bust cycles so the economy takes off and
explodes and then it all implodes and
the bubble bursts and it doesn't take a
genius to see that we're in a bubble in
2007 it doesn't take a genius to see
that we're in a bubble today in 2018 and
a lot of this has to do with massive
Wall Street deregulation so you need a
refs you need refs in the game to make
sure that everything is fair and that
everything is on the up-and-up
and when you get rid of the
it's not that everything gets better
it's that everything in the long run
gets much much worse
Rachel Maddow has really really really
gone off the deep end
with her conspiracy mongering so Donald
Trump went to North Korea recently and
you know he did this ridiculous summit
and in my mind listen it's better than
the alternative I'd rather have Donald
Trump be a silly human being and make
even a half-assed deal with North Korea
to avert war than actually getting into
war I mean we have Mike Pompeo and John
Bolton and all these ultra Hawks in the
administration so I'll take anything
that's not war so I'm actually happy
that this summit happened even though
the optics of it are ridiculous and all
that stuff but on MSNBC and with their
number-one host Rachel Maddow know you
to be to have a principled stance in
favor of peace is too boring and you
know too principled so she of course is
gonna weave this wild ridiculous theory
here and make an ass of herself look at
her breakdown of what's going on at this
of it has a tiny little sniglet of a
border with a third country there
there's only one crossing over that
border it's a bridge it is a bridge you
cannot walk across nor can you drive
across it you can only take a train
across it it's the one crossing on that
border between North Korea in that third
country if you take that train which
doesn't come very often if you take that
train across that bridge from North
Korea and they let you cross that border
where you end up in is Russia the North
Korean dictator and the North Korean
government appear to have not promised
change of any kind in their nuclear
program or in any other policy litoris
literally they gave up nothing they
promised nothing in exchange for that
generous offer President Trump gave
North Korea this royal wedding style
summit in which North Korea was billed
as a nation equal in stature to the
United States
and the North Korean dictator was billed
as an international leader equal in
stature to the President of the United
States as a bonus the president also
threw in literally hours of unwavering
over-the-top praise for the North Korean
dictator and his repeated insistence
that it was his honor as president of
the United States to have the
opportunity to meet with the dictator
and then surprise president Trump
announced when it was all over that he
would end the joint military exercises
between the u.s. and South Korea what if
he is actually ordering an end to these
joint military exercises between the
u.s. and South Korea that is an absolute
jackpot for the North Korean dictator
that is one of the things that he wants
most on earth that he and his father and
his grandfather have been trying to get
for decades and now trauma has
apparently just given it to them in
exchange for nothing
Russia has just this tiny little border
11 mile long border with North Korea
with one crossing on a train and they've
got a troubled and varied history over
the decades with that country but Russia
is also increasingly straining at its
borders right now and shoving back US
and Western influence especially US and
Western military presence anywhere near
what it considers to be its own
geopolitical interests and one of the
things that they have started to loudly
insist on is that the u.s. dropped those
joint military exercises with South
Korea the US has kept those going as a
pillar of u.s. national security
strategy for almost 70 years now until
last night when Trump casually announced
that that's over now he's doing away
with those blindsided everybody involved
and gave North Korea something they
desperately want and would do almost
anything for except he gave it to him
for free how come her brain is broken I
mean she has become the hack of all
hacks and I take no pleasure in saying
this there was a time when Rachel Maddow
appeared to be somewhat principled I
remember when Obama was president early
in his time in office and he actually
escalated the Afghanistan war she did a
segment where she called him out for
escalating the Afghanistan war and said
what are you doing you ran as the
nominal peace candidate and now you're
getting us more entrenched in a war
where perhaps we shouldn't have even
gone in in the first place I mean we all
get going to get bin Laden but staying
there when there's less than a hundred
al-qaeda operatives in Afghanistan which
is the reality of the situation I mean
there was a time when she did that and
she appeared to be somewhat principled
now it looks like she's just got off the
rails on purpose and she's done it for
ratings
she has become left-wing Glenn Beck she
has become left-wing Sean Hannity so
look at the argument that she's making
there first of all let's start with the
you know hand wringing over the idea of
praising a dictator that is that is
literally a Fox News talking point when
Obama met with Cuba when Obama met with
Iran and remember Obama said I'll meet
with them without preconditions now why
did he say that he said that because he
was on on the issue of Korea on the
issue of Iran he wanted peace or excuse
me on the issue of Iran and Cuba he
wanted peace so people on the Left
rightly understood yeah that's what you
do if you want to make peace and you
don't want war you talk to people who
are your enemies because the alternative
is the opposite of talking doing
violence and reasonable people are not
in favor of violence so when Obama did
that everybody on the left rightly was
like oh what a leader negotiating with
Iran to get some sort of peace deal
negotiating with Cuba to get some sort
of peace deal now Donald Trump and
albeit not because of any consistent
philosophical position not because he's
a really smart guy or a reasonable guy
or empathetic guy or anything like that
no he just kind of you know stumbled his
way into whatever the [ __ ] is going on
in North Korea and I like what's
happening a lot better than the
alternative but no because she is just
bathed in anti-trump ISM and it she has
become a left-wing reaction
now all the sudden she's acting like oh
he praised a dictator
Rachel how about the fact that
seventy-three percent of the world's
dictatorships we give money and weapons
to we actively support now in the case
of North Korea we don't support them the
talking to them is with the goal in mind
of getting away from the brink of
nuclear war and trying to denuclearize
them so I'm in favor of talking to
dictators and talking to anybody if the
end goal is let's not have war what I'm
not in favor of is giving money and
weapons and support to dictatorships but
see that's the thing she has nothing to
say about the active support we give to
dictatorships and to authoritarian
regimes but she is just outraged uh you
gave a photo-op to a dictator to Kim
Jong hoon that's unbelievable that's how
diplomacy works I mean goddamn it man
now again I'm not saying Donald Trump is
doing this because he has a principled
stance in favor of peace and doing the
right thing I think it's more likely
he's doing it because of some knee-jerk
reaction arey anti-obama ISM and Obama
wasn't able to get some sort of peace
deal with North Korea so he's just doing
the opposite of whatever Obama did they
say look tremendous I'm not like him I
did the opposite isn't that unbelievable
so I'm not saying his motives are pure
but if we end up in a situation where we
have no war and we have even some
half-assed peace deal I'll [ __ ] take
it
but she can't admit that because she's a
goddamn hack if Donald if we lived in an
alternate universe and Donald Trump and
the Republicans came out tomorrow and
said Medicare for all that's what we're
gonna do Rachel Maddow would have a long
rambling rant about how you know who
else has universal health care Russia
and Vladimir Putin oh that's why he
wants Medicare for all now we any smart
person needs to be against Medicare for
all she's just a hack man she's just a
hack so the praise of dictator line is
just I mean that's just as sad as it
gets and by the way there are a lot of
people who are like dogs gonna just you
know have a Pavlovian response and not a
long bill oh yeah totally
share a border with Russia again if it
was Obama who did the exact same thing
everybody on the left the left would
support it everybody on the right would
oppose it now because it's Trump that
did it
everybody's a partisan hack I mean all
the right-wing pundits like peace I love
peace never supported peace before all
the left wing pundits are like blah
obviously you can't praise a dictator
and Russians has something to do with
this right yeah okay and then here's the
the heart of the story believe it or not
the Russia conspiracy mongering isn't
even the heart of this story and that's
bad enough because she's a one-trick
pony that's all she has to go back to
there's a zillion things you could
criticize Trump for I know because I do
it okay his tax bill which is just a
giant giveaway to the rich and Wall
Street the fact that he's bombing eight
different countries and he's doing it
right now the fact that he signed an
executive order that's Pro torture but
she doesn't criticize him over things
that make sense it's just always whoa
let me connect these dots that aren't
even connected to try to make you feel
like you're in on some grand truth that
others are too stupid to get and that
truth is all the president is a
Manchurian Candidate and he's helping
Russia but here's the again the heart of
the story is she is against giving away
as she puts it our war games are
provocative offensive war games on the
border of North Korea she says quote in
exchange for nothing and then she goes
right along with the national security
orthodoxy the Pentagon orthodoxy the
deep state orthodoxy the neocon Warhawk
orthodoxy which is well this is what we
need to do for national security see
North Korea is such an offensive threat
against Nebraska and Kentucky that we
just have to along with South Korea
do [ __ ] provocative wargames right on
their border where we have where we
simulate destroying the country like we
did in the past by the way and killed
hundreds of thousands if not millions of
civilians on purpose in North Korea she
acts like well that's it
obviously we're supposed to keep doing
that I mean everybody did it to this
point all the previous presidents did it
to this point all the other presidents
had [ __ ] nuclear armed submarines
right by North Korea imagine for a
second the roles were reversed and it
was either North Korea or Iran or
anybody for that matter Russia who
decided oh we're just gonna put nuclear
submarines right by I don't know let's
say the border in New York on the east
coast of the US and we'll throw some in
California while we're at it and oh by
the way right in Mexico right on the
border of Texas we're gonna do these
games don't worry about it's not a big
deal but we're just gonna do these games
where we simulate bombing the [ __ ] out
of Washington DC and destroying the
United States how would we view that it
would first of all it wouldn't be a
question it would be unanimous in
mainstream media they'd say Oh offensive
threats of violence against us they
would melt down and say we're going to
war I guess we're going to war and we're
doing it right now but we get to do that
on the border of North Korea and act
like there's no problem here that's just
what we do and this isn't even a threat
it's not a threat we're a country that
just illegally invaded Iraq and toppled
Saddam Hussein and killed minimum
200,000 civilians we're a country that
took weapons away from Gaddafi and then
topple them anyway
we're bombing eight countries right now
we have nine hundred military bases
around the world we have repeatedly
violated international law but we're
allowed to do military exercises on
North Korea's border clear offensive
threats and that's just normal and it's
okay and it's no problem at all see
she's bought into the philosophy and the
framework of the u.s. runs the world and
we get to
whatever we want we're the sole
superpower might makes right she would
ever admit that but that's the framework
she just bought into when she argues
that Trump just gave away you know the
war games in exchange for nothing
hey here's an idea Rachel Maddow how
about the burden was on you to begin
with why we should be doing those in the
first place and he ain't gonna meet that
burden because we're doing it as an
offensive threat against North Korea
that's the whole point of doing it so
I'm of the belief we should have never
been doing them in the [ __ ] first
place
now again did Donald Trump give that
away for you know some sort of
ideological or philosophical belief no
he gave it away because he's a jackass
and he it's falling all over himself and
he's probably just casually in
conversation with Kim jong-un and Kim
jong-un was like hey man could you stop
like threatening us right on our border
he's like all tremendous believe me I
think we're friends now absolutely we'll
do that no problem whatsoever so you
know I think he kind of stumbled into
doing it and by the way the Pentagon and
others are like wait what we we never
heard about this before going into this
so I didn't even know this was on the
table and now all of a sudden this is
the case so everybody was taken
off-guard by this but my whole point is
I don't give a [ __ ] because that's the
correct policy anyway yes we shouldn't
be doing those offensive threats right
on their [ __ ] border and then the
hilarious thing is if anything actually
threatens people's security its that do
you have any idea all they need to do is
misinterpret one of these moves during
these [ __ ] provocative wargames and
then they thinking they're launching in
defense against the US and in South
Korea they could launch against South
Korea because they think oh my god
they're in the middle of attacking us
now they literally don't know they're
like okay is this are they actually
attacking us at this moment or not so
the thing that actually threatens
people's lives are doing these [ __ ]
stupid-ass provocative offensive threats
in the first place so Donald Trump
happens to stumble into the idea that
we're gonna stop doing that in exchange
by the way for denuclearization she says
oh it's in exchange for nothing
no it's for some
I don't know the specifics of it I don't
know if it'll be total denuclearization
or you know getting rid of the
long-range missiles or whatever the case
is but she frames a like nothing was
given away that's not true and she
frames it like well obviously we're
supposed to be doing that no you didn't
even provide a [ __ ] argument as to
why the neocons are right and we should
be doing that we should not be doing
that at all
I don't like Kim jong-un I don't like
North Korea he treats his own people
like absolute garbage there's no denying
that whatsoever but we shouldn't be
threatening an offensive war against
them goddamn it man Rachel Maddow is
just casually buying into the neocon
framework just yeah like of course what
we should do we should [ __ ] threaten
them on a regular basis and then risk
being on the brink of an actual war
because they might misinterpret it as
they're actually we're actually
attacking them such a hack such a hack
such a hack such a hack I mean I can't
it's genuinely disturbing and
heartbreaking what's happened to Rachel
Maddow over the years just understand
she has no principled beliefs about
anything her whole thing is on the left
wing Glenn Beck Oh many conspiracy
monger and by the way she's getting
fantastic ratings number one on the
network so and that's not good because
what she's doing is creating a whole
bunch of zombies who are anti-trump for
the sake of being anti Trump as opposed
to being anti Trump for principled
policy specific reasons listen nobody is
more against Trump than I am every now
and then II apples just happens to
stumble into doing a semi-decent thing
for all the wrong reasons whatever
that's fine why don't you attack him for
the [ __ ] that matters why don't you
attack him for the [ __ ] that'll win the
Democrats elections and make you look
like you actually care about people's
lives and just so you know the entire
mainstream media that's pivoting to
Trump's right and attacking them from
the right on all this stuff totally out
of lockstep with South Koreans South
Koreans who overwhelmingly support this
summit South Koreans who overwhelmingly
want a peace deal even if it's just a
half-assed token peace deal why cuz
they're actually afraid of some sort of
miscommunication leading to a hot war so
you know people whose lives are actually
directly affected by this
totally disagree with Rachel Maddow and
her conspiracy mongering
and her attacking Trump from the right
what's happened her is absolutely
devastating and goddamnit if you take
her seriously at this point I have no
words for you
so Donald Trump and kim jeong-hoon had
their summit recently you can see you
know this is one of the many pictures
that was taken at the summit and I have
many thoughts and feelings on this
summit but what I want to share with you
first and foremost is Donald Trump when
talking to kim jeong-hoon
broke out a video to show him now
already i think that's kind of funny
because i mean that's it's silly but
it's also kind of relatable in the sense
that you know if I'm hanging out with my
friends or something I'll be like oh I
want to show you this video here come
check it out and then you pull it up on
like YouTube and you're like CEC and
Trump did that with kim jong hoon but
what he showed him was a trailer for the
meeting that they were in and for the
relationship between North Korea and
South Korea and the relationship between
North Korea and the u.s. so it was like
a fake movie trailer that the White
House made in order to show kim
jeong-hoon
- I don't know presumably try to get him
to D you clear eyes so let's watch that
trailer and then we'll come back and
discuss 7 billion people inhabit planet
Earth of those alive today only a small
number will leave a lasting impact and
only the very few will make decisions or
take actions that renew their homeland
and change the course of history history
may appear to repeat itself for
generations
cycles that never seem to end there have
been times of relative peace and times
of great tension while this cycle
repeats the light of prosperity and
innovation has burned bright for most of
the world history is always evolving and
there comes a time when only a few are
called upon to make a difference but the
question is what difference will the few
make the past doesn't have to be the
future out of the darkness can come the
light and the light of hope can burn
bright what if
of people that share a common and rich
heritage can find a common future their
story is well known but what will be
their sequel
Destinee pictures presents a story of
opportunity a news story a new beginning
one of peace to men to leaders on
destiny a story about a special moment
in time when a man is presented with one
chance that may never be repeated
what release shoes to show vision and
leadership or not there can only be two
results one of moving back
[Music]
or one of moving forward
[Music]
a new world can begin today
one of friendship respect and goodwill
be part of that world where the doors of
opportunity are ready to be open
investment from around the world where
you can have medical breakthroughs and
abundance of resources innovative
technology and new discoveries what if
can history be changed
will the world embrace this change and
when could this moment in history begin
it comes down to a choice on this day in
this time at this moment the world will
be watching listening anticipating
will this leader choose to advance his
country and be part of a new world be
the hero of his people will he shake the
hand of peace and enjoy prosperity like
he has never seen a great life or more
isolation
which path will be chosen
featuring President Donald Trump
and chairman kim jungeun in a meeting to
remake history to shine in the Sun one
moment one choice what if
the future remains to be written that is
without a doubt the goofiest [ __ ] I've
ever seen in my life now I want you to
imagine for me if Barack Obama had made
that exact same trailer just clearly
with pictures of himself instead of
Donald Trump and he showed this to kim
jeong-hoon and you know it was an
attempt to make peace and they even
speak clearly in there about you know
like lifting sanctions and having
economic prosperity so let me get this
straight
the pitch from Donald Trump's White
House is let's remove sanctions and help
them economically if they promise to
denuclearize that's almost exactly what
the Iran deal was the only difference is
Iran didn't already have a nuclear
weapon so the whole idea the Iran deal
was let's get a guarantee that they're
not going to create a nuclear weapon and
in return for that we lift the sanctions
and give them back their own money
therefore helping their economy so
there's that's the same concept at work
here so imagine if Obama made that same
video I mean on Fox News Sean Hannity
and and Bill O'Reilly although Bill
O'Reilly he's not there anymore but at
the time they would have screamed ah
weak bowing to dictators apologizing for
America you want to show kim jeong-hoon
in a positive light and talk about peace
if he wanted peace maybe you should stop
treating his own people terribly Obama's
so so sad and weak but Trump does it and
by the way we're gonna get these stories
a little bit later I have clips for you
and everybody's a hypocrite in this
instance the nominal left wing pundits
and the right wing pundits all complete
and utter hypocrite
and that's the thing that's been hard
for me to wrap my mind around is that
Donald Trump clearly doesn't have a
coherent philosophy guiding him that's
obvious but to the extent we can
ascertain any kind of philosophy there
appears to be a heavy streak of anti
Obama ISM because if you rip up the
peace deal with Iran but then you looks
like you're maybe pursuing one with
North Korea that's the same basic terms
that means there's no underlying
principle at work here
you're just a reactionary dingbat and by
the way you're bombing eight different
countries already so the idea that like
oh you have you're definitely for peace
across the board the Republican Party
tweeted something hilarious about how
you know like I'm gonna butcher it here
but something along the lines of real
leaders make peace it's easy to make war
something like that and it's like you're
the Republican party we're bombing eight
countries right now if you really
believe in that quote you'd be calling a
pullout of those eight countries and
you'd be calling to you know decrease
our nine hundred military bases around
the world but no they want to increase
drone strikes they want to bomb eight
different countries they want to keep
the nine hundred military bases they
want to continue to be the world's sole
superpower they want to continue to you
know make apologies for george w bush's
illegal war in iraq which killed minimum
two hundred thousand civilians while at
the same time tweeting about peace the
[ __ ] are you doing now having said all
that do I prefer what's happening now to
the alternative which is the scariest
situation imaginable which is [ __ ]
Mike Pompeo and John Bolton and Mike
Pence and the other neocon [ __ ]
pushing us to actual war oh [ __ ] yeah
I would much rather have Donald Trump
making goofy movie trailers and you know
bowing before dictators and then have
the alternative so you know even though
Donald Trump is 100% being ridiculous
and there's no coherent philosophy
guiding him I'd much rather have this
then then bombs in the air so I'll
[ __ ] take it I'll take it and again I
can't stand the hypocrites on this
you have a lot of you know rachel maddow
a lot of nominally left-wing pundits
screaming about how i can't believe you
gave king kim jeong-hoon a photo up and
then they have these just delusional
statements about how the US has never
treated dictators like this before we we
actively support seventy three percent
of the world's dictatorships and by the
way that means we give them money and we
give them weapons so the case with kim
jong-un is different because it's not
like we're giving him weapons or giving
him subsidies like we do for example
with Saudi Arabia and Israel just to
name two what we're doing is trying to
move away from the brink of war so I'm
totally for talking to dictators to get
us away from the brink of war but I'm
not for actively subsidizing and giving
weapons to dictators see that's the
difference is and they're trying to
conflate it as if it's like the US has
never spoken to dictators before even
though we actively support 73 percent of
the world's dictatorships and so this is
unprecedented but it's also wrong it's
like well no it's not wrong to try to
move away from the brink of war with
anybody that's right that's a good thing
the bad thing is when you actively prop
up monetarily fund dictatorships and
give them weapons and give them support
so even though it's hard to figure out
exactly what's going on here I rather
have this and what the alternative is
and I think that any Democrats who are
trying to position themselves to the
right of Trump on this are making a
grave mistake because that's what's
happening Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi
and so many of the Democrats have
released a list of demands about any
potential deal with North Korea and I
think those demands are just stupid like
for example whatever deal they want it
has to be permanent well the Iran deal
wasn't even permanent it was whatever
was ten to twenty years or something
like that that's how long the IAEA can
go in there and
and check with their weapons and and
check their the level of enrichment at
their nuclear plants so you want a
permanent deal and by the way they
wanted them not to just give up their
nuclear weapons they wanted them to give
up all their weapons which is not on the
[ __ ] table they need some weapons for
a deterrent to Western aggression and to
[ __ ] in South Korea that's not me saying
Kim Jong Un's a good guy that's just me
saying let's be realistic about the the
world as it exists you don't get to
demand absolutely everything and have no
concessions and so the many Democrats
are position positioning themselves to
the right of Donald Trump which is a
[ __ ] terrible idea so ultimately even
though I don't think Trump really knows
what he's doing by the way he gave up he
was like oh we want us to stop the
military drills on your border fine I
agree they're provocative and we don't
need to do that now I'm in favor of
stopping those military drills but it is
true that the way he did it was really
clumsy and like shooting from the hip
and almost classic Trump which is just
like having verbal diarrhea and
accidentally you know saying things you
shouldn't say and he's unable to keep
his cards close to his chest he has no
there is no strategy he's just a
bumbling fool so you know he kind of
gave away a lot of stuff now again I'm
fine with that because I don't think
North Korea is even a threat so I'm fine
with even any token concession on North
Korea's party even if they don't
denuclearize I'd still be in favor of a
deal to be honest now the end the
mainstream in mainstream media you're
not allowed to say that you're paying to
some sort of kook fringe figure but the
difference is I'm actually acknowledge
that acknowledging the real geopolitical
situation which is there not an
offensive threat they're just not they
know that their country is an at on the
world stage and their military budget is
37 cents in a pop tart and they're
[ __ ] people are starving they're not
going to poke the beast they're not
going to attack South Korea because they
know if they attack the South Korea we
attack them and South Korea attacks them
so you know there is a level here of
realism that we're dealing with in North
Korea so since they're not an actual
threat and really that the the real
threat is us toppling them as we've
shown I mean we toppled Saddam Hussein
we topple Gaddafi even after he gave
his weapons since that's the reality I'm
in favor of any deal you know hey give
me some some token concession about oh
we're not gonna do any more missile
tests or you could take away this one
nuclear site okay that's fine and then a
return you on sanctions relief yeah you
want us to stop doing [ __ ] exercises
on your border yeah I don't think we
should be doing those exercises in the
first place so um I'll take it what's
going on here but I also want to be
crystal clear that you know the
Republicans will try to portray this as
like Oh Donald Trump is a genius and
what he's doing is making a deal and
it's really well thought out and he's
playing chess and not checkers and I'm
here to say the [ __ ]
is not only not playing chess he's not
even playing checkers he doesn't know
how to play chess or checkers he's just
kind of bumbling around but again at the
end of the day if that ends up with any
kind of loose peace deal I'm totally
fine with it
so what a weird situation man and by the
way Dennis Rodman was in Singapore at
the same time that they were having this
meeting and Dennis Rodman went on CNN
and was speaking about the deal and I
just couldn't get my mind around the
fact that imagine imagine trying to tell
somebody in like 2005 what the future
holds like oh by the way in 2018 [ __ ]
Donald Trump is gonna be the president
and Dennis Rodman is going to be on CNN
talking about the political implications
of a peace deal with North Korea nobody
would believe you nobody would believe
you nobody would believe you but that's
the state of our politics today which
shows you that there are a lot of
problems I mean maybe we're a little too
celebrity obsessed as a country to say
the least but yeah very very weird
situation unfolding and I can't wait to
get to the stories where I'm gonna lay
out for you in great detail how
virtually every mainstream pundit on the
left and the right is a massive
hypocrite over what's happening here
so how did the elections on Tuesday
night go for the left there were a bunch
of states that had primary primary
elections
well the concise answer about how it
went is this
it was a mixed bag it was so-so
there's some really good news and
there's some really shitty news so let's
go to the intercept here and see what
they report progressives beat back the
establishment in New Mexico where a
Native American woman defeated an
Albuquerque prosecutor with backing from
No Labels a coalition of ultra wealthy
donors who work to tip Democratic
primaries to the right in California it
was the bizarre Orange County races that
got much of the coverage but the House
race there that offered the cleanest
choice between the two ideological polls
was the one in the 45th min a former
sent Senator Chuck Schumer staffer
Center for American Progress Fellow an
assistant professor at Porter school UC
Irvine had the backing of the state
party and the New Democrats those are
the centrist corporatists a Wall Street
friendly bloc that supplied 27 of the 33
House Democratic votes in favor of the
recent bank deregulation bill Porter was
the only House candidate endorsed by
Warren Elizabeth Warren her former
teacher and co-author min meanwhile was
hesitant to embrace Medicare for all and
ran a slashing race attacking Porter's
credentials Porter ran on battling big
banks expanding Social Security
reversing the Trump tax cuts and
establishing Medicare for all and she
won the New Democrats suffered another
defeat in a race that pitted the two
camps of the party against each other in
San Diego's 50th district Ammar camp on
a jar he's a justice Democrat who ran as
a progressive with the backing of
justice Democrats p triple c and d fa b
josh Butner who endorsed by the New
Democrats and backed by the wall street
friendly representative Joe Crowley the
chair of the house Democratic caucus who
is facing his own challenge from the
left back home in the Bronx and queens
from Alexandria
Ocasio cortez campin ajar faces
incumbent representative duncan hunter
in the general election an uphill climb
as Republicans won more than 60% of the
votes in the primary but a grand jury is
hearing testimony related to an
investigation of hunter for misuse of
campaign funds and if an indictment
comes down between now and November the
race becomes that much more in play in
New Mexico's first District Deb Hale and
Antoinette Sedillo Lopez and prosecutor
Damon Martinez squared off Sedillo Lopez
a civil rights attorney had the backing
of some national progressive groups such
as justice Democrats in the Working
Families Party as well as Latino victory
which spent heavily on her martinez
meanwhile got a big boost in spending
from the super PAC tied to No Labels
again the centrist corporatists but
halen who is opposed to becoming excuse
me but halen who is poised to become the
first Native American member of Congress
and had the support of the Congressional
Black Caucus PAC and environmental group
350.org
beat both of them in northern New Mexico
the Working Families party's top recruit
for the night
Susan Herrera pulled off a landslide
upset in a state legislative race that
the local press called the end of a
political era the WFP Working Families
Party spent more than $60,000 on the
race and she knocked off 25-year
incumbent representative Debbie rodella
in an area that is solidly Democratic
but thought to be socially conservative
quote I'm kind of amazed that we did it
Herrera said of her grassroots campaign
in her victory speech rodella's close
ally representative Karl Trujillo was
also knocked out by a progressive
challenger as was representative Belle
Quinn bill Gomez the dubbed the working
family party's Rob duffer II called the
string of wins seismic bringing about a
major sea change in the balance of power
in the New Mexico State Legislature the
establishment was also Delta blow in San
Francisco where business friendly
candidate London breed came out on top
in the
first round of voting but the city uses
a ranked choice voting system in which
voters rank candidates on their ballot
instead of voting for just one if no one
gets a majority of the votes in the
first round
next preference votes are counted until
a candidate gets most of the votes the
left had split its votes between mark
Leno and Jane Kim giving breed a lead
with 36 percent to Leno's 26 percent and
Kim's 21.5 percent in the first tally
without ranked choice voting that would
have been the end of it and breed would
have been declared the victor but with
rank choice votes the bulk of Kim's
support shifted to Leno putting him on
top so that is a clear example of the
populist left winning out as a result of
a ranked choice voting system and you
know if we implement a rank rank choice
voting system everywhere my guess is
that's gonna happen a lot so normally it
just the corporatist would have slid by
because there were two progressives in
the race and they split the vote between
the two of them but because of rank
choice voting one of the progressives
ended up winning that's an awesome story
and it shows how you know good of an
idea rank choice voting is and I think
that should be implemented absolutely
everywhere so but what you saw there
that there's a bunch of victories for
the left now typically what you're
looking for is in all these races here's
how you know a good person won if the
person who won is endorsed by the p
triple c working families party
democratic socialists our revolution of
course justice Democrats there's a bunch
of groups that it's a good indicator of
you know hey that's a good politician
because they're endorsed by that group
now in some instances like Sedillo Lopez
she was a justice Democrat and she lost
which sucks but it was another lefty who
ended up winning so that's not the worst
thing in the world because as long as
somebody who's on the left ends up
getting through and beats the No Labels
back candidate
the new labels backed candidate those
are all that's all centrist corporatist
Democrats then it's good and we're happy
as long as the left beats the
establishment were happy so let me give
you some more specifics as far as the
justice Democrats go a mark camp in a
jar he was a justice Democrat I already
explained how he won his race in
California's 50th district that's great
Audrey Denny won in California's first
district that's wonderful ro kana was up
for re-election easily was re-elected
that's of course wonderful ro Kaunas I
think the very first justice Democrat
he's you know basically at this point
he's the Bernie Sanders of Congress he's
the ideas guy on the populist left Pete
D'Alessandro and Courtney roe these are
two justice Democrats they lost in Iowa
John Heenan is another justice Democrat
he lost in Montana
Peter Jacob lost in New Jersey so there
were plenty of losses but also plenty of
wins now as far as our revolution goes
Jennifer Moretti won in Montana for the
state Senate JD shulton won in Iowa for
US Congress and of course the biggest
one that hurt and I saved the the bad
news for the end here
Allison Hartson lost and Kevin de Lyonne
ended up in van Singh into the general
so everybody knew going into this
election Dianne Feinstein was gonna come
out on top she was pulling away above
everybody else and she has the power of
incumbency so she won obviously but it
wasn't her numbers weren't even that
impressive Kevin de Leon got second he
is challenging Feinstein from her left
but I think there are problems with de
Lyonne in the sense that it appears like
him even running right now is a little
bit of he's playing politics he doesn't
even necessarily want to win he's not
running an aggressive campaign he just
wants to get his name out there more
he's the head of the
the Democrats in the Senate in in
California and he could just be trying
to get his name out there more and so
that he sets up for the next time he
runs for in office everybody knows like
oh there he is right there it's it's de
Lyon and we're familiar with his name
and he thinks that might help him in the
long run he he is running to Feinstein's
left but you know if Feinstein
represents the establishment Daley owns
like the diet establishment the real
populist candidate was Allison Hartson
but of course between the two choices
now of Feinstein or de Lyon I would
support de Lyon because Feinstein is
just really bad but de Lyon got four
hundred and forty thousand votes Allison
got seventy seven thousand votes so then
of course this leads to the question why
did she lose and you know there's a lot
of there are many ways to break down
that question and you know one of the
things is of course and this is not to
you know point fingers elsewhere and and
scapegoat it's and we because we spoke
about these things before the race even
happened well one of the problems was
the media just simply wouldn't cover her
I can't tell you how many articles I
read where they would speak about the US
Senate race in California and they would
only bring up Allison Hartson excuse me
they would only bring up Dianne
Feinstein and Kevin de Lyonne and they
would leave out Allison Hartson and you
know eat any individual establishment
mainstream press outlet it's not a big
deal if they leave her out but the
problem is it was a cumulative effect
where every establishment outlet would
never mention her so people many people
didn't know that she was running or who
she was or what she stood for whenever
people were confronted with who she was
and what she stood for people loved her
so there's a problem with signal
boosting we can't get everything out
there and obviously she had the backing
of new media myself
and the Young Turks and Jimmy Dore and
many others but you know it um I guess
we're not big enough we're not famous
enough we don't get we don't have as why
to reach on our own as we do compared to
the cumulative effect of every single
mainstream media outlet so that's one
reason why she lost the the non-existent
coverage from the media but you know the
real reason is this take a look this is
the amount of money they raised so Diane
Feinstein raised fourteen million
dollars spent eight million okay and
then you go down the list their rocky de
la Fuente is a Republican and got
destroyed but he raised a decent amount
of money
Kevin de Lyonne raised a million dollars
spent about half of that those are solid
fundraising numbers now here's the
really interesting part
okay so Pat Harris is another Democrat
who ran Pat Harrison was expected to do
pretty well in terms of should have been
up there around what de Lyon was at and
was expected to do better than Alison
Hartson but look at what happened Alison
Hartson so Pat Harris raised six hundred
and eight thousand dollars Alison
Hartson raised three hundred and sixty
thousand dollars so Pat Harris almost
raised double what Alison Hartson raised
guess what
Alison Hartson defeated Pat Harris
Alison Hartson finished ahead of Pat
Harris in fact Alison Hartson it was
Feinstein and Kevin de Leon who now
advance to the general election and then
it was a bunch of Republicans and then
it was Alison Hartson so she was the the
the set the second Democrat and Pat
Harris even with raising about double
what finds what Alison Hartson raised
got fewer votes so what that means is
Alison Hartson actually over performed
in terms of her fundraising but that's
not saying much because she still was
you know nowhere near actually advancing
but that means that she had value as a
candidate it is true that she had people
power and
but she just didn't have the money she
didn't have the financial backing to get
her name out there more to be able to
advance and listen man this is why
Alison Hartson has been working with
wolf pack and leading wolf pack and
trying to get this amendment to get
money out of politics because she now
she understands firsthand what it's like
and how it's not theoretical
when Dianne Feinstein raises 14 million
dollars and Alison hearts that only
raises 360,000 man that's an that's a
near impossible hill to climb when you
start from that far back and listen this
is what happened with Paula jeans where
and - I mean we we covered that story in
detail I forget the exact numbers now
but she got about 30% of the vote or so
against joe Manchin but when you look at
the amount of money she raised it was
nothing compared to Joe Manchin I mean
Joe Manchin was just way ahead of her so
you got to understand the dynamics of
this stuff guys if they raise more money
they can run more ads they can get their
name out there more they could you know
they can afford to do whatever push
polling mailers you name it and it also
buys them credibility in the press where
the press covers them as if they're
serious so that's how that's what we
mean when we say the system is rigged
because it's something like 93 percent
of the time the person who raises the
most money ends up winning in
congressional races so I have and here's
the thing like I don't want everybody to
be too upset by this because I have full
confidence that all things being equal
the populist left candidates win because
they actually stand for the ideas and
policies that the majority of the
American people want and that's not my
opinion that's not conjecture that's
what the numbers show that's what the
opinion polls show so if you have
somebody who's a likeable person they're
correct on the issues
and all other things are equal that
person is gonna win but the problem that
we're running into is in the Senate
races in particular there's just such a
gap in fundraising that and all things
are not equal so we can't you know get
to the point where we're considered a
viable candidate and here's how you know
that my theory is correct on this when
you look at the results since we started
you know fighting back at post the 2016
election and there's a bunch of
progressive groups that popped up now
and the grassroots are mobilized and
everything since we started fighting
back you know where we've had the most
success
the smaller the office is so when you go
the local races and the state races and
the evidence of this is go look at our
revolution and the tremendous success
that they've had because typically the
smaller the office the less money it
takes in order to win so the more people
power actually matters so there's been
more left there's been a bigger
left-wing wave at the local and state
level than there's been in Congress and
by the way there has been some somewhat
of a left-wing wave even for the
primaries for Congress for US Congress
but the higher the office the more it's
obvious that it's basically rigged and
there's the money primary you have to
get past before you can be considered
viable and before you have a chance to
win so that's why some of the best
candidates like Paula Jean Swearengen
Allison Hartson didn't advance and
didn't win because they were running for
the higher office the the office of US
Senate and that's where money is
paramount and even more important but
when you look at the victories of our
revolution and many others working
families party the p triple c at the
local level they're almost winning all
of their races so that's reason though
to be to be optimistic because again I
think that shows that all things being
equal our candidates do awesome and
whenever they don't end up doing well
it's not because of the failure of the
message it's because of the failure of
the system and it's because for those
bigger races you just need a hell of a
lot more money so listen yeah to me the
takeaway from this is we need to get
more involved we need
double triple quadruple our efforts in
terms of you know making phone calls and
getting the word out there and letting
everybody know who the good guys are is
again I have no doubt that if the if the
name recognition was much wider and if
if all things were equal
Alison Hart soon would be advancing but
we don't live in that world and we have
to fight to try to get to that world and
it's it's just bottom line guys there's
a lot of work to be done there's a lot
of work to be done but this isn't reason
to despair and this isn't reason to say
[ __ ] it let's all go home this is reason
double triple quadruple our efforts in
order to succeed so this is just another
election where overall the results are
kind of mixed and like I said from early
on what was it 40% 50% of the races run
by our revolution just systemic justice
Democrats p triple c working families in
the rest of them 40 to 50 percent that's
not bad on our first crack at things
especially given the money difference so
let's keep fighting on and never give up
because I can tell you one thing for
sure the establishment won't give up
hello everybody yo we bag son violent
corn we're back from an involuntary
hiatus I still got people [ __ ]
listening to this thing yeah oh I think
you just built up the you know the
demand for it yeah they're gone first
for a while what was it three weeks four
weeks I'm like that something yeah maybe
so yeah people a little tan in the
meantime yeah me too except Lee you can
tell the difference look at my arm
versus my face there's a difference face
or your arm didn't get hit no arm is
lighter
you can't tell arm is lighter than face
like a little bit there's like a light
glares well the light hurts it but it's
that's lighter than this oh yeah my [ __ ]
I got blazed up a lot you did you didn't
put on sunscreen that's not good man I'm
one of those that like dude you're that
[ __ ] ages you like a [ __ ] I know
and like you don't think it now but then
later on like you'll be like 55 and
you'll look in the mirror and be like
goddamn what happened yeah but at 55 I'm
gonna be on some like oh I'm on my I
don't give a [ __ ] [ __ ] right now at 55
I'm gonna be on my I don't buell
[ __ ] so like oh you're not gonna
want to look wrinkly you know what he
wants that's true I did look in the
mirror after I was like my face was red
like this has gotten a little too yes
did you at all you probably peeled a
little bit right no not yet oh not yet
okay it might be coming but I looked in
the in the mirror and like this crease
right here just look diesel-like and I
was like that looks a little bit it
looks a little serious but then I was
like I've been doing it forever like I
just I don't put on Sun so I don't take
the time to put on sunscreen and it's
also hard with those like white
sunscreens when you put it on and you
don't have a mirror the [ __ ] is like
lobbed into your beard and there's like
a little man it's still worth it it's
worth it in the long run even if you got
a little bit if anything if you don't
like rub it in good enough it just looks
like a little bit of gray and your beard
which is like whatever that's better
than getting wrinkles and [ __ ]
well [ __ ] gets like like cluster E it
looks like some cottage cheese [ __ ] like
it looks like if you look at me it could
be like he got some [ __ ] on his face
there like a white head it could be
cottage cheese to be some cream
she's hot as cheese I saw this one
article that came in that like really
hit hit hard and I was like okay I'm
gonna wear sunscreen every time I'm out
in the Sun now because it was like a
trucker and he drove the same route all
the time root room whatever you want to
call it yeah and um the Sun was always
beaming on one side of his face and and
like he would drive that direction
during the day and would be at night
when he comes back the other direction
so he would always get hit in the same
spot with the Sun he looked like legit
to face like from really left where the
Sun didn't hit he looked like he was 25
years younger this side wrinkly as a
[ __ ] and I was like oh that's
all I needed to see I got it Tim yeah
that's pretty scary but he's [ __ ] up
because you do like everybody looks good
with a nice tan you know what I mean uh
the only thing I'm nervous about and it
that sort of scares me a little bit like
I'm not like scared of like death and
all this other [ __ ] and or like if I get
a cold or something like that and going
to the doctor the only thing that scares
me is like what skin cancer or with any
type of cancer or something like that
like I've seen their celebrities I've
saw do it conversations and they're like
you know we went to the beach and it's
like go to the DotA go to the
dermatologist if you think you have
something but it's like we've all these
little spots on our bodies and stuff
like yeah that like yeah you don't know
what the [ __ ] it is like or you feel a
little pain and you're like whatever and
then it goes away but like yeah like I'm
serious yeah like if you really checked
everything you would go be at the doctor
once a week and that's why I can't when
I go to the dermatologist I think I have
like some copay that's like $40 and
sometimes if they do some [ __ ] then it
would be like $200 and I gotta hit a
minimum before I can like not pay that
amount so like a month ago I had like
this little thing on my stomach
and it sort of looked like it was like a
birthmark but I hadn't seen it before
and it it just a little bit but like I
put lotion on it wasn't that bad and I
was like this is something that like is
different you know and I was watching
something on TV today that scared the
[ __ ] out of me there was this lady
who's on like HG TV TV show or something
like that like a home improvement show
and she was just talking for the show
and a doctor was watching and he noticed
something like on her neck like every
time she spoke it was I saw this story
and it was cancer he was out it was
cancer
like like so this lady's just talking
and she just thinks okay yeah when I
speak my throat you know this part right
here is also and it wasn't even that
noticeable
yeah but this guy noticed it so and he
was they met today on TV and it was like
the greatest thing ever or whatever um
but he was saying like you know we know
our bodies best so when I saw that thing
on my body I was like this is something
different you know it's just a little
bit right so I went to the dermatologist
for that and the [ __ ] dermatologist
was like yeah it could be something it
might not be something I was like okay
and he was like if we do check it it's
gonna cost I was like how much he was
like I don't know what's up saying sure
like he didn't have any answers so I
didn't get it done but eventually it
went away so long story short is like
that scares me the most is like seeing
something not knowing if something's
growing on you or something like that
you know yeah and we all have that man
we all had that moment where it's like
oh what is this
mm-hmm I got one of those seizures like
I have a birthmark type thing on my back
mm-hmm but it's like weird it's like
it's like slightly discolor a little
maybe like two inch by three inch
slightly discolored part on my back
mm-hmm that's always been there but like
if I I'm not I'm not all I don't notice
a lot of [ __ ] so like I think I noticed
that when I don't know I was probably
like 13 when I noticed it and I was like
oh that's weird and like that's the type
of [ __ ] where you know it could be
something there might not be anything at
all but like smart doctor every week
exactly but you know what they say
statistically women get that stuff
checked a lot more men do not but then
that actually like women end up in the
long run being better off because they
will stop nip anything in the bud
whereas then you know like my dad he
[ __ ] by the time he went to the
hospital he went to the emergency room
and they were like you have stage four
cancer he's like
oh say I'm like I hope like when I get
to 50 or somewhat of that they're like
yeah when you were you know 29 this
thing was very small and you should've
took care of it then and I'm like [ __ ]
yeah I remember that it's also cuz like
our systems are pain in the ass you were
describing it with the [ __ ] copay and
this and that and that's not that's like
else where else you know in other
countries developed country you just go
to the doctor and then they'll [ __ ]
do their thing and that's it you ought
to pay yeah it's just complicated
because even when he said when I said
how much will it cost the next steps to
find out what it would cost is it was
just like I had to call a number yeah
it's like you got a lucky shirt that's
exactly why health insurance companies
are such [ __ ] because there's like
there's deductibles there's co-pays and
then they have like that the thing that
always pissed me off is that they would
be like you pay them however much you
pay them per month for your health
insurance and when something happens
they're like okay now use house pay the
first 1500 and then pick up it's like
[ __ ] I've been paying you every month
for years and then your act and they act
like like I spoke to somebody about this
and they just had this stupidest like
apologetics for it they're like yeah you
know that's how the system works and
they look at you like you you wouldn't
be a good investment if they looked at
you and thought like hey we're gonna net
have to pay my I'm like shut the [ __ ] up
is I'm not I'm a person I'm a loose in
I'm not a [ __ ] piece is a number II
yeah like so that [ __ ] is so annoying
and that's why a lot of people end up
avoiding working within this system
that's why I do want all that [ __ ] I
hate I mean like I go to the dentist
every year whatever I go to the doctor
and I go to the Drako every other year
to the dentist yeah I probably go every
four years now to come to think of it I
get that thing now we're like like I'll
do some [ __ ] and then I just won't think
about it ever again and then my mom will
call me and be like you have to do this
and I'm like like the other one is the
AC in my place like yeah I'm like and
the guy last time he serviced it he was
like okay you have to get this check
every twice every year and I was like
yeah okay yeah that would feel like I
call you and then six months later I
would have to call him again and it's
like that six months would only feel
like a week later you know what I mean
like I'm gonna really that so I'm gonna
be spend my [ __ ] time doing I got a
call the AC guy you know and like it
should it feels like it's such an
annoying ass waste of time but like the
point is there's a million things like
that that build up you know what I mean
one of them being the AC [ __ ] you know
so always when I go to the dentist I
always whenever I finished my
appointment and they always like you
know you finish up you Pitt whatever you
go to the front desk
there was a girl you want to schedule
your next appointment from what in like
six months I'm like yeah sure and then
I'm it's like six months later is like
July which seems so far away at that
time and then when it comes around I'm
like [ __ ] I may have had appointment and
like I was just there like I was issued
a text like do you want to cancel and
I'm just like yeah i'ma cancel that [ __ ]
yes six months are you [ __ ] kidding
me that's like when you make some plans
with someone like a week out and you're
feeling good yeah yeah yeah what you
yeah whatever we'll get some food and
then just like the day comes you like
[ __ ] what did I tell him right now your
head it's like oh that's so far off of
it I won't have to worry about it now
and that's the worst feeling man yeah I
don't know that skin cancer should
scares me for real because like it was
just I don't even remember who the
celebrity was but he was just like I had
something on my nose went to the
dermatologist he told me that [ __ ] was
gonna get real bad so like my own
emotion my neighbor similar thing
happened he he had a bandage the other
day on and I asked him he was like I
went to the doctor they said it was you
know I guess what skin cancer that'd do
take skin off do you think Loki Mel you
had the like skin cancer on his face and
he that band-aid [ __ ] huh yeah what
would what would be the reason to put a
bandaid on your face this reason they
wear like a quadruple XL shirt did not
it's not cuz he's obese it's because
it's a fashion statement something
that like you where to cover your body
like you know cuz it's just society does
that [ __ ] there's no purpose for a
bandaid on your face there's no surgery
for a [ __ ] grill but they wear grills
there's no purpose for a grill you could
get a gold grill and it's like showing
like your [ __ ] like riches [ __ ] like
putting TVs in your rent shows your
hardest [ __ ] that's the point the point
is no a baby toys [ __ ] if anything you
want to be like here's my [ __ ] scar
no you want a you want to wear the bed
the band a is a fashion statement man
I'm telling you seems like I'm wearing a
bra wearing a bracelet like there's no
reason for this it's just on the band a
he did the same [ __ ] with a band aid he
was like it's on [ __ ] say something but
I don't know how banding is a medical
[ __ ] thing the bandy
your bracelet doesn't serve any it is
true you wouldn't you wouldn't do any
other medical thing like to for a
fashion statement like you wouldn't just
walk out of your house like you know I
got my I got my shin brace on son yeah
like I'm not even a q-tip in my ear like
because like it's [ __ ] cool there had
to been a reason someone should
investigate that [ __ ] man like you don't
just wake up and just be like yo man I'm
gonna throw bandaid on my face and I'll
make that [ __ ] hot because there's no
there's no [ __ ] justification for
that [ __ ] do you
he might have had skin cancer I doubt it
I don't imagine he did so he's got
discovered on our show imagine he like
tweets me like man the [ __ ] the amitabh
speaking of the appointments thing I
feel like I was just at the eye doctor
the other day but it wasn't it was like
over a year ago same my eyes my eyes had
I have really shitty eyesight I think
most people know that but um I it stayed
stay stable for like at least five years
where it didn't get worse for like five
years but then I think it just it just
got worse like it just got worse because
I noticed that my contacts now aren't as
good like well you proud I mean you
stare at your computer screen a lot
right when you're researching and stuff
like that do you do it in the dark like
probably if you're doing at night or
some [ __ ] like that
like I noticed when I'm doing work a lot
the lights are off but
true that that [ __ ] up your eyes or no
I don't know because I feel like it
can't just be from like what I've done
because it has to be genetic because I
in second grade I had to wear glasses
second grade you only mean yeah yeah
like I was in first grade and [ __ ]
that's true but did you even know it's
second grade that you couldn't see or
was that just on some like I don't I
don't know how we figured it out but I
think you know whatever my mom was like
what's that and I was like I can't see
that [ __ ] like it was obvious that I had
trouble seeing long distance it was
clear yeah I'm always like curious a
little bit when you see like toddlers or
like you know cute kids wearing those
small ass glasses I'm like how do you
know those [ __ ] can't see it
and they're not just like their eyes
have to develop well I I don't know how
we initially figured out that something
was off but it became clear something
was wrong when I went to the eye doctor
and you do the test and they're like
yeah no of course like it when I you
initial kid signed out super young I've
seen young kids and like yeah it looks
cute they were those smallest glasses
and like their eye balls the same size
as the [ __ ] glasses
well like they're not [ __ ]
comprehending enough [ __ ] to go to the
eye doctor and be like I can't see that
or like even if they can't see it maybe
in two years their eyes they're gonna
[ __ ] grow and they can see it and
you're [ __ ] them up even more I don't
know if that ever happens where they get
bed and they get better I'm not sure if
that's ever happened that'd be amazing I
mean obviously if you got LASIK I was
like a growth process like the [ __ ] I
probably know I know but like if you as
you grow it doesn't it doesn't
necessarily go in the right direction
like you can't you know I'm saying like
you can grow and part of the growth is
your eyes are gonna get shittier you
know what I mean like part of growth for
this happens with all kids you lose your
baby teeth and remember that hold on
let's stop and talk about that for a
second there was a portion of our lives
everybody here listening and [ __ ] where
your teeth were baby teeth and then you
they fell out and then you grew bigger
teeth what the [ __ ]
like we were I mean that's some [ __ ]
weird primitive ass [ __ ] like you lose
all your little teeth they fall out and
there's blood and [ __ ] and then the
bigger ones grow what da [ __ ] is that
man yeah I mean that's I'm like that's
that's a that's a big reminder like
there were animals even just your
fingernails growing like where does
where does that come from
like the [ __ ] like my knuckle there's
no like there's nothing in my knuckle
that looks like my fingernails like if
you get some sort of like just a minor
or like cut or something let's say
you're playing basketball and you fall
on like concrete yeah like that whatever
you scrape your knee like okay you put
someone you clean it out put some
ointment on I put a little bandaid on it
or something and then like you take off
the band-aid and then like a week later
that [ __ ] is gone it's like wow that's
almost like magical or even a broken leg
like your bone healing back together
like obviously you got to put it but I
gotta set this [ __ ] have you ever had a
broken bone no no broken back um what
though worst don't worry I imagine that
[ __ ] I can't imagine just being like a
mobile and not being able to like open
it like when I [ __ ] let everybody know
grocery bags or some [ __ ] and I can't
open the door I feel like you know like
um I'm struggling have you ever had
sleep paralysis yes that's it I had I've
had that a few times that [ __ ] is scary
that's scary and then the cramp in your
legs is the worst feeling like when you
get like the diesel not in like you ever
get that in your calf I've got that
before that and that before that's like
too much calcium built up or something
like that I have no idea what causes it
you know I looked recently at like a
really old dude and I was like that's
gonna be me at some point like that's
gonna that's all of us that's gonna like
you look at somebody who's really up
there in age and it's like you know you
might first split-second be like damn
like that person could do more to get in
shape and be more mobile and all this
but it's like actually know at a certain
point your body's just not gonna [ __ ]
do it anymore so you look a little
Bernie Sanders or something like that
and it's like he's he's old as [ __ ]
can't really do [ __ ] but then like he
was running track he was doing mad [ __ ]
nothing says healthy I'm talking about
somebody who's old man I guess not
everybody gets to the point where
they're like you know kind of bent over
and to have zero flexibility and like
their mind is working really slowly or
whatever but yeah you but it's a lot of
that stuff let me put it this way in
many categories it's totally unavoidable
like you know everybody gets wrinkles
everybody gets less flexible as they get
up grow grow old or you know I'm not
sure but there's a very high percentage
of like dementia once people go past a
certain I don't know the exact numbers
but it's like if you get over the age of
85
it's some preposterous ly high
percentage chance that you're gonna get
dementia like it might even be like
50/50 I probably have that [ __ ] now
isn't that no no you don't have it now
my my grandmother one of my
Bernie Sanders went on Bill Maher show
and for the 38th time he clearly showed
the Democratic Party the path to victory
so you mentioned the Democrats lost last
time but your agenda one you may not
have won the nomination right but you
talked about an agenda they're all
behind that now let me Medicare for all
yep you know all the people who are
running for president we can't know who
they are and income inequality all those
issues right but an agenda is not a
message they are different
Trump is better at messaging they don't
his voters don't seem to care about an
agenda or anything except build a wall
lock her up what's the Democrats message
if you had to boil it down to something
that would fit on a hat which is about
all people can take in at this we're
what is the Democratic Messimer chronic
message is that we need a government
that represents working families not
billionaires an agenda an agenda that
says that health care is a right not a
privilege an agenda that speaks to the
young people and says that we should
make public colleges and universities
tuition-free and lowest even debt Trump
has shown that the American people they
elected him III understand he didn't win
the popular vote but he got a lot of
votes and so they and and his popularity
rating keeps going up not down yeah it's
it's almost in the range of like a
normal president which is really scary
because he certainly is not that so they
obviously don't care about so many
things they used to care about like
decorum or policy or democracy or
freedom of the press so in this new
arena and he's a he is brilliant at
controlling the debate and controlling
air time what does a Democrat have to do
to compete on this news is a news day
that's a fair point and the air time
issue is very difficult you know
people's are we're wired the Democrat
talking about issues well you know what
in many cases Democrats aw
but we're overwhelmed with Trump's
tweets and the absurdity of the day so I
think what Democrats have got to do
basically is go into Trump country and
talk to people who are now living in
desperation you know the truth of the
matter is one of the reasons in my view
that Trump won is that he sensed that
there were millions of people in this
country who were ignored by the
political establishment they ignored by
the elite they're working longer hours
for lower wages they're scared to death
about the future facing their children
and he said any light I hear you our job
is not to lie to have the guts to deal
with the serious issues that they face
and to take on the people who have power
in this country first his slogans are
actually really good and they're right
off the top of his head so Donald Trump
has make America great again and that
kind of caught on and became this huge
thing Bill Maher asks what's the
Democrats message so policy is something
separate but let's go with just
messaging what's your message well can
you put out there that people will
digest and it becomes like a make
America great again type thing and I'll
top this head Bernie goes represent
working families not billionaires that's
pretty good
you know that's um that reminds me of
the Labour Party in Jeremy Corbyn for
the many not the few that's basically
saying the same thing the heart of the
argument there is the same thing
represent working families not
billionaires and then he gives another
one
he says healthcare czar right not a
privilege that's really good too
you know these things are all designed
effective slogans and effective messages
are designed so that if you disagree
with it you look like an [ __ ]
that's the whole that's the that's what
the key point of an effective slogan is
so when Donald Trump says make America
great again if somebody on the Left
disagrees with that
you look like a dick because you know
they always have the ability to fall
back and just go to the plane face
reading of what it says like what do you
mean you don't wanna make the country
great now of course you can interpret
and you couldn't take a lot of things
away from exactly how they want to make
America great and there's plenty of
stuff to disagree with in that but at
face value when somebody says make
America great again what did Hillary say
in response she said America is already
great that's the dumbest response I've
ever heard in my life because you know
half of working people in this country
make $30,000 a year or less our
infrastructure gets a grade of D plus
we're bombing eight different countries
you know you go down the list and it's
like people are struggling now she
doesn't realize that and her DC and New
York bubble and her elitist bubble but
that's exactly it like that exposed how
out of touch he is when he says make
America great again
and you know she's like it's already
great people are like hey [ __ ] you no
it's not I don't feel like it's great
right now so I think Bernie's onto it
there with messaging Healthcare's are
writing on a privileged represent
working families not billionaires those
are both very powerful to the heart of
it and again if somebody on the right
disagrees with that and they will by the
way they will you know have plenty
eighty it's like huh
Health Care's are right not a privilege
yeah okay like like ben shapiro about a
year ago or so argued like you know oh
you weren't able to get health care
that's crazy i wasn't able to get
expensive furniture but you don't see me
complaining what so in an attempt to
disagree with these very you know
non-controversial statements like health
care czar right not a privilege they
exposed themselves for being clowns and
that's the point of a good message in a
good slogan
okay now the second part i wanted to
discuss was bill maher starts breaking
down what it's like in the age of trump
and he says hey man people don't care
about what they used to care about they
don't care about decorum anymore in the
age of trump they don't care about
freedom of the press they don't care
about policy so when he says they don't
care about decorum
I think that's true and I think decorum
has always been overstated and it's
funny because that's one of the that's
one of the go-to moves among
establishment Democrats is decorum
policing and manners policing like Oh
have you no decency sir some if somebody
says something crass or they curse it's
like oh my goodness we're all against
this ride let me shake my finger at you
now that was always a stupid move or
maybe it wasn't a stupid move in like
the 80s when decorum was that like a
peak but now from then on it was mostly
a stupid move because people are just
regular people and they talk like
regular people and when you decorum
police you come across a little elitist
and a little silly you know it's like
get it decorum policing is being over
concerned about trivial matters like the
language somebody uses so you're right
bill they don't care about decorum
anymore but I'd argue that's a good
thing because there's it's nothing but a
[ __ ] distraction take care about I
know I'm not gonna look at the substance
of what you said I'm gonna look at how
you said it like okay that's [ __ ]
stupid so they don't care about to
quorum you're right about that the idea
that they don't care about freedom of
the press man yes and no I think people
do favor freedom of the press but when
Trump attacks the press a lot of times
they like it because they also think the
mainstream media sucks largely because
they do suck just gets Trump shits on
the media doesn't mean that the media is
by definition good you can be against
Trump [ __ ] on the media and cracking
down on the press I am while at the same
time acknowledging the media blows I do
so that one's a little more complicated
but here's where Mars totally wrong
Martin this is something you see in his
commentary all the time he acts like
well the American people are stupid and
they don't care about policy and then
understand anything they're idiots
either way you know he does that kind of
rant all the time like lambasted regular
people like oh you're not you know what
the [ __ ] do you know type thing and
that's not true at all the if I think
the American people do care about policy
and Bernie agrees with me and in
thinking they do care about policy
because even though we're Marv is right
is that okay people usually don't know
like historical facts like if you Paul
the American people many of them don't
even
the vice-president is so yeah they're
ignorant in that sense but they're not
stupid
because when you pull them they kind of
know what's good for them
they kind of know like yeah we should
raise the minimum wage and make it a
living wage and tied to inflation we
should do pro-union legislations that we
have a strong middle class we should tax
the rich you know we should do free
college we should end the stupid Wars so
people aren't stupid they could be
ignorant historically they are at least
in the u.s. that's what the polls show
you don't know like Supreme Court
justices and [ __ ] like that or history
or whatever but that doesn't mean
they're stupid that doesn't mean they're
masochistic and they're like I am for
policies that suck no they're not
they're actually for a lot of the right
most of the right policies that's why
when you look the issue for issue the
American people are overwhelmingly
left-leaning so they do care about
policy but the thing is Bill
establishment Democrats have never given
the people the option of voting for
policy so then Bernie comes along he
gives them that option
shocker he's the most popular politician
in the United States look at that so
they're not stupid and it's not that
they don't care about policy is that the
Democrats never gave him the [ __ ]
option and then the one time somebody
does give us the option Bernie Sanders
he instantly becomes the most liked
politician in the country and then let's
guess the final part here which is
Bernie's core message mars-like how do
you in the age of Trump how do you make
it work because he sucks all the air out
of the room with his tweets and you know
he knows how to control the message and
get the nonstop media attention and all
that stuff and Bernie Sanders says very
simply you got to go to the red states
now this is the main difference between
a guy like Bernie Sanders and every
establishment Democrat in the country is
that establishment Democrats and you saw
this clearly with Hillary Clinton they
view people who are Republicans or who
are you know nominally against them they
view them as an enemy to be defeated so
it's no longer about hey I'm a
politician I have this political vision
this philosophy this ideology that I
think is gonna help you and improve your
life they lose that because they don't
really care about people they don't
they care about power and
self-aggrandizement and you know being
in charge so they lose that ability to
actually give a [ __ ] about people so
it's not like hey I'm trying to help you
I'm on your side so vote for me with
somebody like Hillary it's you're a
deplorable if you don't vote for me
so like shame shame on you as if shaming
people is gonna be an effective tactic
where they're like oh I can't wait to
vote for the person who shits on me on a
daily basis they're not gonna be in
favor of that
so Bernie's idea is I'm they're not my
enemy
even if somebody disagrees with me on
everything I still want that person to
have health care I still want that
person to have a good education I still
want that person to have a stable and
healthy income I still don't want to
send that person's kid to go die in a
stupid war so that's why Bernie Sanders
you know he's beloved by the base the
left wingers but then also in the
primary for example he won more
Democratic voters who described
themselves as conservative so in the
middle of the country in the red states
bernie destroyed hillary clinton and
you're probably thinking well i don't
understand how can that be how can you
have somebody who's more favored by the
base of the party but also by the
right-wing he's the person who gets more
independent voters moderate voters
crossover republican voters how can it
be he's more popular among the base and
among the right-wingers the answer is
very simple
he's authentic and he actually gives a
[ __ ] about you and even if you might
disagree on the details
most people's reaction is minor details
he means well that that's what counts
he's authentic he's genuine he's honest
he means well he wants to help me and my
family so I'm in favor
whereas Hillary you know and all the
establishment Democrats people get this
smug you know elitist vibe from them
where they don't look at other people as
like somebody they want in their coal
listen through helping them with policy
they look at them like how dare you not
vote for me you know how how dare you be
a deplorable how dare you not
immediately understand that I'm trying
to help you and the reality is with
these Towson Democrats and I even try to
help you they're in favor of standard
neoliberal corporatist war mongering
policies so listen if you actually
believe in your message and Bernie
Sanders does of course you'd have a
50-state strategy the idea that it's
even a question
and by the way establishment Democrats
are not in favor of a 50 straight state
strategy because they want to give up on
everybody who doesn't already agree with
them which is a recipe for continuing to
lose by the way but if you actually
believe in your message well then of
course you take it everywhere because
you'd say hey listen even if I can't
even if I can't end up winning certain
states I'm gonna get a hell of a lot
more support there than you think
because I believe in my message and I'm
gonna spread it from the rooftops from
the mountaintops it doesn't matter I'm
gonna I think I can convince you that my
ideas are better my policies are better
so I'm gonna do that that's why I'm
gonna go to Mississippi I'm gonna go to
Louisiana I'm gonna go to all these
places that the elitist Democrats put
their middle finger up to those people
so and he's right I think that the thing
about Trump one of the reasons why Trump
won is because he had this
anti-establishment vibe and people
thought hey we'll roll the dice maybe
he'll break [ __ ] and they'll actually
help the people
well now the jury's in on that he hasn't
he just hasn't his tax bills a massive
evil way to the rich he packed his
administration with Goldman Sachs he
started even more Wars he took we're
bomb in seven countries he took it to
eight and the list goes on and on how
he's fighting for the elites and how he
is the ultimate establishment president
now well Bernie Sanders is gonna come
along and all that stuff that voters
thought was cute before about Trump like
hey look at how on him she is any tweets
now is just gonna look childish but you
know when confronted by somebody who
actually does care about the policy and
is actually not faking it like Bernie
so it's his election to lose and every
time he opens his mouth and lets me know
what his strategy is and Woody
on doing I believe that more and more
what's up [ __ ] every time I do a
livestream I'm reminded of how stupid I
am because I'm like this isn't how it
was working last time last time it was
easier to do this so I think I'm live
now it says I'm live now so I'm gonna
assume I'm live no you know I got to
also figure out how to do Lilith was
telling me about mods I got to figure
out the mod situation you know what I
don't like I don't like how we're
recording now but then when this goes
when this goes up afterwards it starts
with like it starts like 30 minutes and
already which i think is kind of weird
because some people will go and watch it
and then they don't realize that there
was like a whole 30 minutes they missed
i guess the video has to process it's
the same reason that when you do a live
stream the comments underneath sometimes
don't show for a really long time
I noticed that happened when I went on
Joe Rogan I went to the to watch the
video and it said loading the comments
for like a really long time it took like
a day and a half before the comments
actually showed up okay so let's I'm
gonna talk about a few things and then
I'll take some super chats from
everybody but first let me hop on over
to the control room Intan and see what's
going on I'm mostly doing this because
there hasn't been a Kyle encore in like
a zillion weeks and I feel kind of bad
about that and not to throw a corner
under the bus but I'm gonna throw him
under the bus every time there's a Miss
Kyle in Koren it's his fault it's never
my fault I'm always down to do with Kyle
in corn so but he's been busy he's an
actual human being who like goes on
vacations from time to time so he's been
he's been away or he's been working
overtime at his job job and he hasn't
had the time to do a Kyle and Koren I
have a Swedish Fish here no I have not
sold out to Swedish Fish
you know I remember these being better
tasting than they were I feel like um
the last time I had sweet when I was a
kid and I had Swedish Fish oh my god
these are so delicious now they just
taste like whatever I'd rather have um
I'd rather have some sour [ __ ] some you
know like the worms that have the sour
taste and the little like the sugar on
it that's a lot better than this I think
somebody's had swedish fish Chuck I
wouldn't say suck
I wouldn't say suck but I'd say they're
they're very mediocre somebody's got to
go to school now that sucks man you're
gonna miss my live stream because you
got to sit in a classroom everybody
knows I'm more entertaining then
whatever your whatever is happening in
your class will I do a Joe Rogan podcast
why beyond Joe Rogan at some point in
the future I'm sure I will mean him got
along really well and I've spoken him a
few times since I've been on his podcast
and I'm sure I don't know maybe like a
year or something I'll go back on I hate
traveling though everybody knows up I'm
a little [ __ ] he's he said a long time
ago not to me but on a podcast a long
time ago that he might actually come to
New York and do some podcasts here I
guess he would come here like do
stand-up and then do some podcasts and
if he's ever in New York you better
invite me on for sure except that's a
hell of a lot easier than going all the
way to LA um ok so let me start talking
about some stuff I'll take some super
chats later but before I do [ __ ] all
right first thing I wanted to talk about
was I'm gonna butcher this name so bad
it's comical arcadi are are Katie
Arkadiy Arkadiy bad chenko it sounds
like okay like a name I made up like
[ __ ] around with a friend or
something
Arkady babichenko is I guess a Russian
journalist or maybe a Ukrainian
journalist but just I think Russian but
very very hard on
Putin and the Kremlin and there were
reports like three days ago like this
guy was murdered and like every Western
media outlet immediately ran like a
thousand articles another Putin critical
journalist killed another Putin critical
journalists killed well guess what I
think was yesterday randomly he showed
up on like a TV show it was like I'm not
dead
and I guess it was some sort of sting
situation where there was a hit out on
his life and so they were to him like he
was already dead in order to get the try
to figure out who did put the hit out on
him or something like that I don't know
the details of it it doesn't matter
bottom line is the second that Western
media outlets thought they had like
another anti-putin story they were like
yeah awesome another journalist killed
it's almost like they revel in it
but then it turned out to be [ __ ]
and it's like oh wow you guys really
jumped a gun whenever there's a story
that paints an official u.s. enemy as
bad they will immediately run with it
and like be really critical but you know
flip the script to a US ally and it's
nothing but bending over backwards to
try to make it seem like they did
nothing wrong and the perfect example
that is Israel I mean Israel massacres
journalists when they wear they're
wearing a [ __ ] vest that says press
and Israeli snipers are shooting them
from 200 yards away murdering them and
it's all on video and there's no like
you know a flow of stories and and
unanimity among the opinions in said
stories about how a what a human rights
abusing terrible regime maybe they need
regime change over there so I just find
it funny how it's almost like the
propaganda so in your face that you
can't help but laugh at it the other
thing that I was thinking about
yesterday because Trunk keeps doing it
he's like a broken record he's got his
he's like um a musician that has their
greatest hits and he just keeps going
back to his greatest hits to make his
audience cheer but he keeps talking
about ms-13
and he keeps pretending like the entire
Democratic Party is like oh we are in
favor of ms-13 and I just like everybody
to know that that we are actually on
their side and we think that they're
wonderful and I'm just like I'm stunned
by the fact that his supporters are
going with that and he keeps saying that
as if it's not the most obvious straw
man in the world like it requires the
bare minimum amount of intellectual
honesty to admit that when Democrats
went after Trump for that comment that
he made they interpreted what he said as
you know all undocumented immigrants
coming in the country are animals and I
played the clip for you guys now in my
opinion I genuinely see how you can
interpret either thing from what he said
but what's stunning to me is how Trump
is just pretending like every Democrat
is defending ms-13 a vicious gang where
they have [ __ ] tattoos on their face
and they [ __ ] kill everybody in sight
and no nobody's defending ms-13 they're
saying hey man we think you just called
all undocumented immigrants animals and
that's what we have a problem with but
you know you have Trump going around
acting like they're cute they love ms-13
Democrats love ms-13 and then the the
irony beyond that is you know how you
could actually effectively fight back
against a gang like ms-13 and other
gangs by ending the drug war by
legalizing marijuana at a federal level
by decriminalizing all drugs because how
do you put gangs out of business how do
you crack down on the black market and
how do you reduce crime well very simply
by legalizing the product taking it off
of the black market so that they go out
of business because nobody's gonna want
to go to some shady you know back-alley
dealer to get some drugs when they could
just go to CVS or Walgreens or you know
how there's like liquor stores and stuff
imagine if there was just well they
already have this on like California and
Colorado and stuff but they're like a
weed store yeah I'm just gonna go into
the weed store
and get some weed you know who wants to
go to a back alley with some shady
characters when they could just buy it
legit over-the-counter even if it's
slightly more expensive when you go to a
legit store the overwhelming majority
people gonna want to go to a store so
it's like a deathblow two gangs like
ms-13 if you end the drug war but Donald
Trump is pursuing policies that embolden
ms-13 while he's lying about how
Democrats love ms-13 that's what they do
they love em as 13 and I'm just so it's
so [ __ ] it's just so dishonest like I
try my best to always assume good intent
among people and think like oh no they
they believe whatever it is they're
arguing so they're arguing in good faith
and I try my best to stick to that as
much as possible but there are so many
examples where I just don't see how that
interpretation is reasonable like I all
you can view that as is Donald Trump and
his supporters many of his supporters I
should say they're not acting in good
faith they're not being intellectually
honest it's like obvious that Democrats
are not Pro ms-13 they're Pro you know
undocumented immigrants and they don't
want them all to be lumped into the same
basket and treated like [ __ ]
um and then there's a really sad story I
want to talk to you guys about Harvard
just released a study and I'm sorry that
I'm too in these but they're too good I
just said they were mediocre now I'm
saying they're good I contradicted
myself they taste good when you're
really hungry I'll leave it at that um I
just worked out two which is like why
are you eating swedish fish after you
worked out you [ __ ] I agree why am i
doing that it's [ __ ] stupid I'm a
jackass so a Harvard study estimated
that at least four thousand six hundred
and forty five people died in Puerto
Rico due to Hurricane Maria the official
death toll we read for this so this is
what the US government admits and Puerto
Rico is a u.s. territory so we obviously
bear responsibility in the fallout FEMA
is supposed to be there they're supposed
to be helping making sure everything's
okay and then back on there
rebuilding infrastructure and to an
extent they did but you know Trump tried
to make clear early on like this is not
my Katrina this is not my Katrina no
matter how you look at it's not my
Katrina and he honestly in the fallout
of when the hurricane hit he was
bragging about how low the death toll
was I mean think about that in the wake
of the devastation he goes there and he
starts bragging about how low the do we
should be very proud low death toll very
proud and that's him basically saying
this is not my Katrina so don't look at
me like George W Bush I'm successful
he's not the official death toll is 64
that's what they admit to the Harvard
study says four thousand six hundred and
forty five people minimum so that is I
mean that is such a [ __ ] man
holy [ __ ]
mother nature is I mean if mother nature
wants to [ __ ] you up you're done you got
no hope Lilith was telling me a while
ago I got a text from her I don't know
maybe two weeks ago now she was like be
careful there's a tornado watch in your
area I was like what the [ __ ]
so I start looking at the weather and
it's true I looked outside guys it went
from like a sunny day beautiful outside
pretty hot but beautiful in terms of
sunshine and everything blue skies all
of a sudden it was like a [ __ ] scene
from the day after tomorrow that goofy
ass movie we're like this guy just
turned like the most ominous shade of
grey I'd ever seen in my life the wind
kicked up you know there was supposed to
be hail that came now I didn't end up
getting hail I spoke somebody who did
get hell and it looked like a tornado
could hit any second so I went
downstairs and I was like I turned into
a little [ __ ] cuz that's you know it's
times like that and Lilith well honestly
laugh at that ultimately because she's
in tornado alley so she sees the real
devastation she's seen the tornadoes and
everything but that's when you realize
like oh [ __ ] we're all just like on
borrowed time because if you're in
if you're in California there's gonna be
a big-ass earthquake that hits at some
point and you're overdue for it you know
if you're in Florida for example they
get walloped by hurricanes all the time
you go from the south and then move
north towards the Northeast and that
entire area they're just regularly gets
hit by hurricanes where I'm in New York
sometimes we get hit by hurricanes but
usually it's at the tail end but like no
matter how safe you think your place is
it's just not I mean there's the the
[ __ ] supervolcano that can go off
like we have that in the United States
and if that thing were to blow forget it
like more than half of the continental
United States would just be wiped out
from a supervolcano and the fallout as a
result of it
so nothing's stable and then when you
read like we had Hurricane Katrina back
under Bush you would think that since
then they would have you know FEMA
totally ready to go for if another
situation like that were to happen and
we'd have all the procedures in place to
to fix everything and ameliorate the
damage of any kind of natural disaster
[ __ ] that is not the case at all you
know think of how like the DMV works and
how its really shitty and just kind of
like scrap together
that's [ __ ] FEMA to like they'll have
some crates of food and they'll have
some [ __ ] rafts and [ __ ] and they fly
it in there but then the distribution
networks aren't there anymore because
the people who are supposed to be the
first responders in Puerto Rico we're
unable to get to the place where they
can get the goods and then distribute
them to the people so and the other
thing is how many people of the 4645
people how many of them died from like
starvation because that could have
happened like they survived the
hurricane and then it's like oh we don't
have any food or any way to get food and
there's no way to travel now so I mean
the fact that this [ __ ] is happening and
like in the modern day it's like wow we
are all [ __ ] it just reminds you how
human you are and how [ __ ] fragile
you are when it really comes down to it
and it's some really scary [ __ ] so
there's some other stuff I was going to
talk about but I think I'm actually
gonna have to save that for the show for
tomorrow to do proper segments on it so
I guess now skis I will start taking
some super jets if I can find yes I can
here we go
all right hit me [ __ ] Oh actually
before I do that let me ask a question
do I have the new emblem for the
livestream setup or is it the old radio
wave emblem because I tried to change it
to the new one and I'm not sure if it
worked like it looks like it didn't work
when I try to change it so is it the old
one or the new one is it the old emblem
or the new emblem for the secular talk
screen like when I started the
livestream and it showed up and some
people are saying it's the old one [ __ ]
ma'am why is everything so goddamn
difficult I tried to change it and it
just like wasn't changing and I'm like
what this should not be as [ __ ] hard
god damn it that's annoying okay I'll
figure out a way I'll figure out a way
mmm I obviously can't do it now cards
what's cards you don't want whatever
whatever [ __ ] I'll figure it out some
other time anyway ask away [ __ ]
you know chomp away on these swedish
fish I'm such a hypocrite because it
annoys the [ __ ] out of me when people
are doing a stream and they make mouth
noises and then Here I am with this mic
that picks up every little noise you
make and I'm eating swedish fish do I
have
the wrong thing on top chat live chat
all messages are visible some messages
such as potential spam may not be
visible hmm whatever you're getting old
Kyle technologies becoming too hard for
you it's always been hard for me I'm a
[ __ ] idiot go back and watch some of
the early like 2008 secular talk videos
um I didn't know what I was doing then I
don't know what I'm doing now his Linda
Sarsour a bad representative for the
left yes and no I mean she said some
stupid [ __ ] about like Sharia back in
the day but I think now she's not like
she's not in favor of a theocracy she
supported Bernie Sanders for [ __ ] sake
what guy secular as secular can be
growing hemp in the Appalachian
Mountains for biofuel to get away from
Saudi oil influence and give those
people jobs to go back to didn't didn't
they legalize hemp recently in Kentucky
or they're trying to they need to do
that I enjoy the Allison hearts in an
interview I hope the polls are skewed
and not taking account certain factors
well all she needs to do is get to the
general and then she has a very good
chance so as long as she's in the top
two for the primary which she very well
could be then she's in the general then
we're really talking Kyle I'm planning
on joining an electrician Union I was
wondering why there's hate against
unions in general well that's the
propaganda that we've been fed over the
years that unions are bad and they make
people lazy and you know they're they
get they make it so the workers get more
than their then then they need or
whatever but that's just the propaganda
that's been coming from management
bottom line is strong unions equal a
strong middle class and are there some
downsides to it sure you do get the
occasional old guy that's lazy as [ __ ]
and still gets paid well but I think
that aspect of it is a necessary evil so
we continue to have a strong middle
class so I think the hate against unions
is largely unmerited unmerited Sargon
want you to come to his Manhattan events
wants to discuss things on stage you
didn't know how to reach you though
email him right down there you know okay
I have his email I'll reach out to him
thank you um I enjoyed your interview
mmm
loved the show but I'm joining the Navy
I'm as left as you are with maybe a
couple exceptions should I just avoid
all political conversations I just find
it hard not to call out bad opinion bad
points I don't know man that's a tough
one I mean you're going into what's
probably a hotbed of not conservatism
necessarily but the way the military is
designed you you have to listen to your
higher-ups like that's the design of it
it's very hierarchical
it's very authoritarian in that respect
I know I don't say that as a pejorative
authoritarian I say it is like it's just
the nature of what it is so I don't know
that's it that's that's a difficult one
man that's a difficult one um just be
true to yourself and you might find that
you don't even want to be in the Navy
once you're in the Navy I've had some
friends who've been you know involved in
the military some of them stayed for a
while but others dip their toe in the
water and we're like [ __ ] I can't do
this so that might happen take my money
you lesbian sumbitch there's some amount
of immoral oh is there some amount of
moral ineptitude you are willing to put
up with for the right policies moral
ineptitude I'm not sure you mean so let
me ask are you talking like FDR packing
the courts for example which is
unethical but the ends justify the means
type thing is that way your are is that
what you're asking me if I'm okay with
that
I think that's why you're asking me but
hello hello hello everybody I have a
very special guest today Allyson Hartson
US Senate candidate from California
she's running against Dianne Feinstein
in the Democratic primary thanks so much
for joining me I really appreciate it
I just realized my headphones are
plugged in oh well I hear you good can
you hear me now good or not okay
I like how we both have no clue what
we're doing with stuff like this same
with every interview I do so there's a
lot of stuff I want to I want to talk to
you about you are
I think the first Senate candidate that
I've ever spoke to done an interview
with on air so I'm excited for this but
I'm also excited just because of what's
been happening with your campaign
recently I mean it's really taken off
and you can see even on like Twitter you
know you'll regularly say something and
it'll blow up and I'm like ooh now you
know old but you know the old political
establishment would look at that and
they kind of laugh like oh like Oh
Twitter mentions are important like oh
okay all we care about is getting our
billions of dollars but I think that
there really is kind of like a snowball
effect happening in terms of you really
getting your name out there and really
having a chance in this election so let
me just start with that basic question
do you think you're gonna put up a good
fight or possibly even knock off Dianne
Feinstein yes well first of all if I get
into the general all signs point to
completely obliterating her I in
November just have to get past the
primary and that is only seven days away
so the question right now is because
it's pretty expected that she's going to
take first place on June fast
just being the incumbent right so the
question now is who's gonna take second
place because we have a top two jungle
primary here meaning for those who don't
know your your party doesn't matter
anybody can vote for me they don't have
to change their party and it can
two Democrats that actually make it
which is what happened in the last one
as well and so this is relatively recent
for California so the likelihood is and
anybody who's a serious challenger right
now is running as a Democrat and right
now every poll almost every poll that
has included me has me statistically
tied for second so you take that and
combine the fact that I am beating every
single candidate six to eight times on
social media every single week we are
not plateauing we continue to climb that
means people who are liking following me
engaging sharing etc those are real
people that the media is ignoring that
the polls aren't grabbing right and then
and then you combine on top of that the
number of volunteers that I have I have
over nineteen hundred volunteers who are
making phone calls and knocking on doors
of people who aren't being pulled and
making sure that we're getting those
people to to the to the polls and and no
other candidate and any other serious
candidate is ever talking about their
volunteers because they don't have any
then you add on top of that the number
of small dollar donations that I have I
am cleaning the clock on smaller dollar
donations
seventy-two percent of my donations are
small dollar two hundred dollars or less
every single other candidate is either
self-funded or most of their money comes
from large dollar donations so that
again translates into real people who
are supporting me on every single level
so that's like a Bernie Sanders style
campaign you're getting most of your
money through small individual donations
which is basically probably the best
week model we could use other than
actually getting an amendment to the
Constitution to get money out of
politics so I want to talk to you a
little bit about that wolf pack but
before we get into what you did with
wolf pack I want to ask you a little bit
about your life before Wolf Pack what
did you do before wolf pack I was a
public high school teacher for ten years
I
taught in a low-income district serving
predominantly first in second-generation
students from Mexico I taught English
and then I also design intervention
program for students who are at risk of
not graduating high school so I was
working with students who statistically
wind up in prison or wind up on the
streets wind up in gangs wind up with
drug problems or even addictions I had
students coming into this program who
were already involved I had students who
were homeless who of course were
struggling with focusing in school and
my job was to design a way to help keep
these kids off the streets help them not
become a statistic and make sure that
they not only graduated high school but
were able to go on and do what they
wanted to next with their life at least
have those opportunities and so many of
my students ended up going on to college
and graduating college and it's it's
been really successful and so so that's
what I did prior to this which is what
ended up leading me into Wolfpack so
what what made you want to get involved
with Wolfpack well it was really the
movement of getting money out of
politics and prior to Wolfpack I was
volunteering with every single get money
out group that I could get my hands on
so I what I was interested in doing was
finding out for myself what is the best
way for us to overturn citizens united
and related cases if it's not that what
are other ways that we can possibly get
campaign finance reform so is it
transparency is it at the state level
the local level the federal level there
are so many ways to come at this and so
I volunteered with every single group I
was still teaching at the time of course
and I was really frustrated because
every group I found amazing people but
no solution no lasting real lasting
solution that actually addresses the
issue of how money is corrupting our
political system so I was really
straighted and i started to I just
continue to do research online and I
found wolf pack's website so I actually
didn't know the young turks at the time
I didn't know who gen Cougar was and I
found this website it was probably like
15 pages deep in my Google search and it
was like the the most like rickety kind
of site you've ever seen and I I assumed
that like two dudes were sitting in
their living room through this website
together and we're like we're gonna
figure out how to know how to save the
world and so then I I mean I remember
specifically sitting in my living room
saying well now it's gonna be too good
two dudes and a gal volunteer and the
rest is history and you've had some
success with Wolfpack correct like
haven't you actually gotten you know
some some state governments to take
action yes so almost as soon as I signed
up the the team took off we had
practically no action here in California
to get our measure passed through the
state legislature so I eventually built
a team I became the California State
Director I was still a volunteer at this
time and then organized thousands of
volunteers throughout the state and
successfully led the passage of that
measure through the state legislature
once that was done I thought it was
gonna go back to my life okay I got that
I that that's that's the nice thing to
put on the mantle and and let the other
states do their thing but it didn't work
out that way other seats other states
needed my help to basically replicate
the model that I had built in California
so I turned around and did the same
thing in New Jersey and Rhode Island and
eventually I became the National
Director of Wolfpack and it and I
stepped down from teaching it was a
really really difficult decision to make
because I I got into this in large part
because of being a teacher because I
really want to help reform and
strengthen our public education system
but I I realized that the fastest way we
can
any institution any issue that we're
fighting for the fastest way we're gonna
do it is to attack the root cause and
since the root cause is by and large
money in politics we we have to focus on
that so I became the National Director
we've now passed our measure in through
five state legislatures we are
introduced in over 25 states we've
passed it and through several state
chambers either the house or the Senate
and and now here's here I'm running for
US Senate taking that experience to
straight to Congress is the goal so the
goal is you get money out of politics
and then is part of the amendment
publicly financed Clean Elections like
is that in the amendment itself it's not
in the amendment itself right now but it
certainly could be that is something
that that people talk about the
amendment itself the way it works is
there's two ways to get an amendment to
the US Constitution so you can either do
it through Congress or you can do it
through the states and if it goes
through Congress it has to pass each
chamber with a two-thirds vote and if it
goes through the states then two-thirds
of the states have to pass it which is
thirty four states whether it goes
through Congress or whether it goes
through the states it still has to then
be approved by the states known as
ratification where 38 states have to
approve of it whether it came from
Congress or a state convention so so the
one of the things to that I want to add
is we're really coming at them from
every angle we're making sure that as
important as it is to end this
corruption that we don't leave anything
on the table we are working to to get
big money out of politics at the state
level at the local level at the federal
level to get this US Constitution
history shows us that the way that you
get a constitution is by coming at it
from through these these convention
measures through Congress so get me into
the US Senate and I can actually
introduce the Amendment myself so
there's a there's a coalition of groups
working on this
American promise is one of the group's
right now that is really helping to
bring all of these groups together and
actually talk about the language design
the language for the amendment itself
and there's a there's a rich discussion
about what does say what does it not say
how much do you leave in the to the
Constitution and how much do you leave
to the legislation that follows that
constitutional amendment so right now I
know that like Genk would like to see
publicly funded elections in the
constitutional amendment right now I'm
of the opinion that it would need to be
legislation that follows that
constitutional amendment so we'll see
what comes from that but it I am a
strong proponent of replacing our
privately funded elections with publicly
funded election so it sounds to me like
your diagnosis of the problem is similar
to mine and that when you look at the
political landscape in the u.s. what you
find is a complete and utter disconnect
from the will of the American people
through the opinion polls and the laws
that end up being implemented so you
know there's just to give a few examples
over 90% of the American people want a
universal background check on gun
purchases I believe it's over 60% of
people now want to legalize marijuana
and you know only only 17% of the
American people
still wanted to be in Afghanistan and
that was from a poll done all the way
back in 2013 I haven't seen a poll on it
since then nobody even bothers to ask
the question but basically the point is
here you name the issue and basically
the Senate and the house representatives
are just ignoring the American people so
can you talk about that a little bit and
tell me what what what are your issues
what are you gonna bring to the US
Senate what are you gonna fight for yeah
well you know another thing as far as as
which maybe there's a little irony there
over 90% of people near it's around 97
it depends on the poll depends on the
year but over 90 percent of people also
want to overturn Citizens United can
relate to cases and it's
very issue that in large part has led us
to where we are where those who are in
office can completely ignore the will of
the people and keep getting away with it
we have legalized bribery and we see
this play out in one issue or area after
another where white-collar crime is
legalized essentially and so you know
the what we need to do Medicare for all
is is a no-brainer I think it's even as
high maybe 70 percent is actually here
in California maybe it's closer to sixty
percent nationwide college for all is a
no-brainer federal minimum wage I say
living wage tied to inflation because by
the time we get it it will probably be
higher than fifteen dollars an hour but
whatever that living wage is make sure
we tie it to inflation and we need to
have a green economy that replaces our
war economy we do those things right
there we're gonna be in really really
good shape but there's a number of other
things that we need to do as well and I
think that we can do at the same time we
in order to be able to accomplish this
we're going to have to hold our
corporations and the wealthy accountable
for paying their taxes and we also need
to make sure with as far as publicly
funded elections go that that everyday
people can run for office and
legitimately have a chance at winning
because I believe at one of the reasons
why the the legislation that we see
being passed and and it's not just in DC
it's at the state level to the the more
expensive our federal races are becoming
it's trickling down to this to the local
level to be a millionaire or no a
millionaire to run for office for the
most part and what that does is can you
hear me okay yeah you broke up there for
a second but I could hear you pretty
well
okay okay okay good it says poor
connection on my part but what that does
is it makes it so that it's not just
money that corrupts its
it's the people you surround yourself
with so it's the fact that we have a
bunch of wealthy elite people whose
perception of reality is completely
different from ours who are governing
and legislating on behalf of our lives
they're passing legislation that
reflects the way they think the way they
live they don't know what it's like to
have to decide between buying medicine
and and putting gas in your car or or if
you're going to give up that vacation at
work just so that you can make that
overtime and make more money so that you
can like buy your kids new clothes for
school I mean just little decisions like
that that they don't ever have to
consider and and so that is what is is
really creating this this huge this this
this huge gulf between our will and and
what they will to happen and so that
Princeton study that came out a few
years ago that showed 0% of the will of
the people as reflected through
legislation but what it did show is that
I think it's like something like 30
percent of the time it does reflect our
will but only if it is what the wealthy
elite also happened to one right so let
me ask you a question are you willing to
buck the Democratic Party when you're in
the Senate because we know that you're
gonna run into just a you know a
waterfall a tsunami of nonsensical
proposals from the elitist Republicans
in Washington everybody understands that
but you also will run into the people
who will tell you in the democratic
party that in order to be pragmatic and
in order to be realistic oh we need to
go to the right and meet the Republicans
halfway and listen you can't wage a
revolution overnight and you're gonna
hear all of these things coming at you
from the likes of Chuck Schumer and from
the likes of you know the leadership of
the Democratic Party are you willing to
buck the leadership of the Democratic
Party and tell them no I have a mandate
from the people and the polls are clear
so you need to do your job and reflect
the will of the people
yes I look forward to spending the first
two years doing that and then we'll have
more progressives in there in 2020 2021
what I have to do is go in there and
hold down the fort and you know there's
there's no way I'm under no weird
illusion that I'm gonna get in there and
all of a sudden get all of these
policies passed myself that's just not
the way it works so what I'm doing the
the strategy for our progressive
movement is get progressives like me in
office we open the door and it's gonna
be a floodgate they see that a campaign
like this works I mean we're already
seeing senators like Cory Booker and
Kamala Harris start to come around on
some issues refusing to take corporate
PAC money signing on to Medicare for all
because they see the writing on the wall
now that will change that's all gonna
stay simply rhetoric unless we keep
holding their feet to the fire and we
keep coming after them and so their next
move should I get in there is going to
be to soften me up and to make sure that
I understand how to be pragmatic I have
to stand strong just like you were
describing and then more people are
going to see how that how it works
more progressives will run more
progressives will win we will have a
voting bloc by 2021 and start getting
our legislation passed and you know the
other thing too is that every single
time there's there's there's
compromising when it comes to getting
legislation passed but there's also that
fine line of not compromising our values
our progressive values and also
understanding how to negotiate you don't
start in the center with negotiating on
what you want to get with our
progressive policies past so every
single time you start to to really
compromise on our values then you
whittle away and that's how you start to
see me
the maybe people who are in office who
truly were somewhat progressive at some
point are even more Center and they keep
moving that way and that's what I mean
by having the wealthy elite in there or
being surrounded by them you start to
lose perception of the reality for
everybody else and so not not just other
people myself I have to be careful that
when I'm there I'm not just surrounded
by them all day every day because that's
what happens to anybody and so and it
just compromises your integrity and
that's where that corruption comes from
in large part so I have to I have to
make sure that I'm doing things like
coming back to my state of California
holding town halls regularly doing town
halls like this virtually even when I
can't get back to California and stay
connected to the people so and that also
helps me to stand strong when I'm there
on the floor or in a committee hearing
sometimes and oftentimes going to be the
lone voice speaking on behalf of the
rest of us but I look forward to it so I
ask that question because um you know
one of the problems I see is that even
when the Democratic Party is not wrong
on an issue often times I would
criticize them heavily and say hey
listen you have the same donors as the
Republicans in some respects whether
it's for-profit health insurance
companies or Wall Street or the
military-industrial complex but there
are issues where the Democrats are
better like for example the overwhelming
hey guys so I have a really special
guest here it is the big Seltzer sellout
kayo kolinsky how's it going man
it's going well man how are you hon -
well man so I have to start this out by
first saying that there's a conspiracy
going around that you don't have any
legs and that you're a floating torso
fake news fake news you're gonna you
know what are your thoughts oh this is
this is very fake news so first of all
there's a there's a video going back
probably may even be like three years
now but I did a live show in New York
City with Jiang 40 whitey and in that
entire video my legs are visible the
entire time so and then there's also a
video from probably three or four years
back of my golf swing that's on YouTube
yeah so yeah I have I have legs but you
know they're kind of skinny kind of kind
of [ __ ] legs I've been doing squats and
doing deadlifts and getting them bigger
but you know ultimately I'm genetically
limited so I have like little twig legs
I see so you know the fake news media is
gonna keep spreading fake news but I
know it's fake news so I'm comfortable
with everybody speculating while they
want I see okay that's good so I thought
we started out talking about the amazing
Trump presidents go on presidency is
going on so I wanted to know your
thoughts on what's going on
especially with some of the recent stuff
with the Iran deal and other things that
are related to that yeah so um I mean I
guess the best way to describe the Trump
presidency is the establishment on
steroids when he ran for office there
was a small chance that he was going to
be anti-establishment and that he might
be a little bit populist because there
were some things he said on the campaign
trail that indicated that he might do
that but you know I think most people
pointed out
that is probably just Donald Trump being
Donald Trump and saying whatever he
could say to get elected and he doesn't
really have any core beliefs but for a
guy like Donald Trump who was basically
just empty and vapid you know I think
that whoever is in the room with him
that's the the person or people that
he's going to listen to so he surrounded
himself with people like John Bolton
people like Mike Pompeo the biggest
neocon Warhawks in the country he
surrounded himself with Goldman Sachs
lackeys and Wall Street people so you
know any hope that people may have had
early on that he might act in an
anti-establishment fashion that's all
dead and gone because when you look at
his policies and what he he's done it's
um it's exactly what the establishments
dream is you know Donald Trump is George
W Bush Plus mean tweets I mean that's
what he is so you know it's um it's
terrible and I think we're at a very
dangerous time in history right now
because with stuff like pulling out of
the Paris climate agreement and like you
reference pulling out of the Iraq on
deal I mean this is like genuinely
destabilizing stuff and that's on top of
the you know the race to the edge of the
earth with income inequality and I mean
we're basically testing the limits and
how much human beings can take here
because we have extreme income
inequality now in the US but also around
the world I mean what is it the richest
like six people have more wealth than
the bottom 50% of the world so it's like
six people with more than however many
billion what four billion or so now so
yeah it's just it's terrible in every
imaginable way so what do you think okay
so he recently just bought out of the
Iran deal
I was curious what your you know
specific assessment on that was and as
to how bad it really is because I feel
like I don't think people really
understand how bad it was the pulling
out of that deal yeah it's um
I mean you really couldn't do anything
dumber but you know the idea is they
want regime change I mean again like I
said Don
Trump's in the room with John Bolton and
Mike Pompeo and if people say well I
don't you know hey Trump maybe doesn't
want regime change or Trump just doesn't
care well at the end of the day he's
still doing what the neo cons want I
mean this is the neo cons wet dream to
pull out of the Iran deal and I mean
Iran there was a question as to whether
or not they were even really trying to
get a nuke to begin with you know
there's there were have been countless
statements from the Iranian government
and I'm no fan of the Iranian government
they're a brutal theocracy but you know
they saying things like having a nuclear
weapon is on Islamic and we don't want a
nuclear weapon and and things of that
nature so there's a question it's
whether they were even really trying to
develop a nuclear weapon in the first
place but the idea of like giving them
back their own money that we stole from
them in exchange for having the IAEA the
International Atomic Energy Agency like
basically go in there whenever they want
to regulate and check out how much they
are enriching uranium because they do
have uranium for you know medical
purposes and for power for their power
grid which they're allowed under
international law but basically having
the IAEA in there in exchange for us
giving them back their money which they
we really shouldn't have taken in the
first place I mean that's just good like
there's no that that you know puts the
u.s. and Iran on stable ground and but
of course what the reality is is Israel
hated that and they're one of our top
allies if not our top Ally Saudi Arabia
hated that they're one of our top allies
if not our top Ally and we're basically
doing the bidding of the neocon Warhawk
Netanyahu who wants regime change in
Iran and we're doing the bidding of the
Saudi government and they also want
regime change in Iran it's so funny
because they talk about Iran as if it's
like this this giant threat for
expansion meanwhile Israel bombs the
Palestinians every other week and
they're also they've also been
intervening in bombing in Syria and as
far as Saudi Arabia goes they've been
bombing the [ __ ] out of Yemen non-stop I
mean there's a genocide going on there
they're massacring women and children so
it's so funny I mean this is just sheer
projection when
the Israeli government and the Saudi
government say oh my god Iran as a
regional threat that's absolutely
nonsense how many countries is Iran
bombing right now none so I mean it's
just these guys want war they want
regime change and that's why they would
do an action like pulling out of the
Iran deal and I just you know what's so
sad to me is that nobody even like in
the media they won't put this into
context for you like Bernie will talk
about it and it to an extent and like
but that's it really nobody in the media
will tell you like oh hey by the way in
in 1953 we overthrew Iran's
democratically elected leader Mohammad
Mossadegh the CIA did a coup and then we
put in the Shah to be a dictator because
we wanted cheap oil and he would give us
cheap oil and that led to the 1979
Islamic Revolution so like they never
tell you like hey maybe our meddling in
the first place was the problem and the
fact that we've been you know basically
acting as a rogue state for decades now
so you know there's no there's no
possible positive spin that anybody
could put on pulling out of the Iran
deal and if they do I frankly I think
they're just uninformed or they're an
idiot I I think so too you touched a
little bit there on Benjamin Netanyahu
Israel
I was curious what your thoughts are
because as of recent events I don't know
if you saw were they or they almost like
really went head-to-head in Syria where
they literally almost went to war with
each other
and I've sort of been looking at
Netanyahu quite closely now apparently
he essentially the police in Israel have
recommended that he be can he be charged
on indict on charges of corruption yeah
so yes I really I really hate the guy I
was curious what your thoughts are on
him because he's really honestly because
it almost to me seems like Trump is
doing the bidding of Benjamin Netanyahu
yes I mean like I said I think he's
doing the bidding of everybody who's
around him and who's he surrounded by
he's surrounded by Mike Pompeo he's
rounded by John Bolton he's surrounded
by Goldman Sachs lackeys
yes he's surrounded by guys like
Netanyahu so I think you have a point
there and yeah I mean then Yahoo I mean
let's just call him what he is he's a
[ __ ] war
well that's what he is I mean look at
what happened in 2014 in Gaza they did
basically a bomb orgy where they bombed
hospitals they bombed schools they
bombed the only power plant in Gaza they
killed 80 percent civilians according to
the UN at least 500 children look at
what they just did recently where they
killed about 60 Palestinians who were
protesting and they wounded about 2,000
I mean this is Maremma lie mean there's
no other way to put it he's not
interested in peace I mean he's the
person who's blocking any kind of peace
deal and you know people might hear that
be like oh my goodness what are you
talking about Kyle no you people need to
follow this stuff I mean even Hamas came
out years ago I think it was in 2011 and
said you know what okay fine we'll take
a Tuesday deal and we'll take it along
the 67 borders so in other words even
the people who are held up as like the
worst of the worst
on the Palestinian side are like okay we
tap out you got us to state deal let's
do it and then Netanyahu of course
rejection so you know if they're if
Israel is rejecting every offer for
peace from the Palestinians and you know
through Jordan at the UN as well the
Palestinians have proposed this so if
he's rejecting everything like what do
you expect them to do that's my question
like what do you expect Palestinians to
do if you tell them we're gonna
permanently occupy you there's gonna be
a permanent apartheid state I'm gonna
bomb you every year every other year and
just cut the grass as some experts have
called it it's a way of keeping them in
check
well what do you what do you expect them
to do they have no hope they have and
it's just an a gasa for example as an
open-air prison so it's just a he's a
war criminal and he should be locked up
and it's amazing how you know the US
media doesn't they don't cover these
things objectively I mean the bias is
unbelievable and what's hilarious is
you'll hear people say that there's a
bias against Israel in the mainstream
press which is like yeah exactly
laughable right I know so I think that
there's a whole other level of trumps
you know shitty presidency because you
know about the UN embassy or the US
Embassy moved that he made and after
that shortly after the boss came I was
saying
we can't have the us being a mediator
anymore effectively destroying almost
like any prospects for peace so I was
just you know what are your thoughts on
are there any prospects for peace
between the Palestinians Israelis in the
near future if so how does it happen
the only hope is through BDS that's it
that's the only hope that's the only
possibility for peace I think because
they're not they're never gonna do it
willingly ever ever ever ever ever they
need to be forced into doing it and the
way to force them into doing it is
through economic pressure and you know
this worked with apartheid South Africa
so boycott divestment sanctions is
exactly what it says in the name it's
putting economic pressure on Israel and
boycotting businesses that are in occupy
in the pride territories and calling for
international sanctions so even if you
know whatever the u.s. obviously won't
get on board with this but if you can
get every other country on board to put
pressure on Israel that's the only way
that there's hope because as soon as you
start affecting rich people's pocket
that's when they'll start paying
attention and that's exactly what
happened in South Africa yes Nonna's the
world turned on South Africa and crack
down on them and rich people all the
sudden had their bank accounts
threatened that's when they were like
well okay okay maybe maybe there
something we can do here maybe there's
some you know peace agreement we could
do here so I just I don't think it's
ever gonna come willingly I think it's
gonna be when Israel's forced to do it
and you know as far as what the US can
do I don't think they will do it and I'm
honestly not even sure if under a Bernie
Sanders presidency he would do it
although I hope he would but what the
u.s. should do is immediately cut off
all subsidies to Israel and immediately
stop giving them weapons I mean that's
the easy thing and then if they you know
if they that's not enough of a
disincentive for them to stop doing what
they're doing then you you sanction them
you actually sanction Israel because if
anybody has earned it if anybody
deserves sanctions it would be Israel I
see yeah
thinker I think you're right on that I
was wondering if you had seen Bill
Maher's comments he had his real time
Bill Maher did you see his comments on
on this on what happened well I didn't
see the most recent comments but I saw
some headlines about what he said and I
mean he's been doing this for years this
is a issue that's why it's interesting I
was gonna ask because you've been
covering this for lid of the years he
has a giant giant giant giant blind spot
on the issue of Israel and Palestine and
he's basically you know like a standard
right-wing douche bag on this issue and
he blamed Palestinians for for their
deaths essentially I mean listen there's
no that argument honestly might be the
dumbest argument I've ever heard when
they say oh my goodness Hamas blame
Hamas because we massacred Palestinian
civilians it's like well hold on if your
argument is they set up this devious
trap then why did you walk into the
devious trap that's because you're the
ones that are telling us that this
devious trap exists so if it exists and
you know it exists and you have the
foresight to call it out well then the
last thing you should do is walk into
their devious trap and kill the
civilians because the reality is it's
not that's just that's a nonsense
argument that's a stupid argument it's a
way of saying whoever the victims are
we're just going to declare that they're
actually the perpetrators and where the
victims when meanwhile all you have to
do is look at the power disparity in the
situation and anybody with two brain
cells can figure out what's happening
here on the Palestinian side they have
burning tires and rocks and slingshots
that can't even reach where the Israeli
soldiers are there were zero Israeli
soldiers hurt or killed zero Israeli
civilians her car killed but you had
about 60 Palestinians killed and about
2,000 injured so you tell me what's
going on here and who's to blame yeah I
definitely think that it's very obvious
it's just it is an interesting thing to
me to see that Bill Maher you know he
was you know massively against Trump but
he was he supported his embassy move as
well which is it's very odd well I'll
tell tell I'll tell you part of what's
going on there what a lot of people like
to say is Oh Israel only democracy in
the Middle East and they stand for
liberal values and then
they'll say something like you know hey
where would you rather be a gay person
would you rather be gay in Gaza or would
you rather be gay in Israel and that's
their way of saying like okay
since the domestic policies of Israel
are in some ways more tolerant than in
majority Muslim countries therefore
Israel gets to act super far right-wing
on foreign policy and they get to be war
hawks and they get to bomb civilians but
you're supposed to think that they're it
they're still doing the right thing
because liberal values but you know my
response to that is always know you
could give Israel credit for you know
being further ahead on the issue of gay
rights domestically but that doesn't
take away from the fact that they're
still doing apartheid and illegal
occupation and they Massacre civilians
like every other week so it's just a
stupid sloppy way of thinking and it's
excuse making I mean there's a term for
it that I read a while ago that I
thought was interesting I think they
called it pink washing so like the idea
is you're using the fact that they might
be ahead on the issue of gay rights to
try to override the fact that they're
the ones who are a settler colonial
state and they're doing apartheid I I
think I agree with your assessment that
I do you think that's kind of ridiculous
you know how dangerous is it that our
president is essentially being coddled
by both Mike Pompeo as well as John
Bolton it's I can't imagine a more
dangerous situation
that's as dangerous as it gets people
really don't understand you know this is
if I were to sit that if you would give
me a week and tell tell me hey sit down
and tell me who the absolute worst
person in the world is that the US could
have as a top foreign policy adviser
that honestly I don't think I could come
up with anybody worse than then um I was
gonna say Michael Bolton John Bolton
Michael Bolton's the same that poor guy
he's no John Bolton is I mean I've said
it before or jokingly but he makes
George W Bush look like Noam Chomsky I
mean this is really a guy who has
consistently and repeatedly
for regime change in every country
imaginable whether it be Iran whether it
be North Korea he was one of the chief
people pushing for the Iraq war so and
the thing is man there's no like it's
just so stunning how there's no there's
no consequences in Washington DC for
being objectively wrong about everything
you've ever pushed for and even a guy
like Tucker Carlson who in many ways is
just odious loser
even he was able to press John Bolton
and make him look as ridiculous as he is
because every prediction these guys made
was proven to be dead wrong I mean it
was John Bolton and Bill Kristol and
these idiots who told us like oh don't
worry we'll be greeted as liberators in
Iraq and the oil will pay for the war
and we'll be in and out really quickly
and all just all this [ __ ] that
wasn't true so you know what I like to
say is I think neoconservatism and
American exceptionalism I think that
that kind of manifests as a
fundamentalist religion in some people
where it doesn't matter what the
question is the answer is always more
American militarism and that's um that's
dangerous man
another word for American exceptionalism
you could drop that word exceptional and
just put supreme so what John Bolton is
is an American supremacist so he thinks
all their people in other countries are
inferior and we have a right to dictate
to them how they can live and how they
should live and everybody should bend
the knee to our interests so he really
is as dangerous as it gets and it drives
me crazy that you know it's he's not
really discussed as such by the
Democrats and by the mainstream media
glenn beck went from being a firebrand
right winger during the bush and obama
years to falling out of the public eye
rather quickly after he went hardcore
anti-trump during the primaries so he
was totally for ted cruz didn't hide
that at all and when Trump won he threw
a Fed and he nearly cried and he said
I'm never gonna vote for him and I'm
never gonna support him well guess what
totally unsurprisingly the vapid
soulless shock jock flipped here's why
I'm predicting a 20/20 win when I saw
yesterday the how the press was all
reporting the same damn story that
Donald Trump was calling ms-13 gang
members they left that out of the story
animals and they were spinning it as if
he was saying that about all immigrants
I'd had enough I'd have enough media if
you can get me Glenn back to do this and
in case you're only listening to us on
radio I just donned a red make America
great again hat if you can drive me to
the point to where I say you know what
I've had enough I'll vote for him in
2020 gladly I'll vote for him in 2020
and not really even on his record which
we'll talk about here in a second is
pretty damn amazing but if you can drive
me to the point to where I'll wear one
of these stupid red hats I'm telling you
you're making a gigantic mistake and I
welcome it I would just like to look at
the president's record now every
president will say to you when he's
running I'm gonna make I'm gonna make
Jerusalem the home huh really
the home of the embassy really are you
because everybody says that nobody
doesn't he did it and I think that's
gonna go down as the biggest
game-changer possibly in my lifetime
this is good it already is it is
changing the game in Iran and there are
there are riots in the streets now in
Iran streets in Iran in some towns it
looks like a war zone because the people
have risen up and that's gonna continue
to build and when it does this president
is going to come out and say something
directly to those people that we support
them and that's going to add fuel to the
fire and you might see a regime change
and a collapse of the Islamic regime in
Iran and it will be 100% Donald Trump
that made that responsible 100% you're
gonna see changes because of this he
kept that promise a promise I said he's
not gonna do that nobody's gonna do that
he did how about the president's coming
up saying well I know I can defeat Isis
I know I can do it I'll defeat Isis he
did and did you notice no one in the
press even talked about it
oh we're not talking about Isis anymore
how come oh I know President Trump
that's why how many people wow i naka
we're not gonna we're not gonna be
involved in these global agreements for
global warming right sure I'm on record
saying he will never do that because his
daughter is a huge global warming person
and he only listens to the family and
Ron Glenn who else is doing that just
that is enormous gotta stop the TPP
uh-huh right sure you are mm-hmm yes he
did I'm gonna bring North Korea to the
table gee looks like that's happening
give everybody a tax cut I don't like
the tax cut I think he could have gone a
lot further but that's not even his job
Oh make it stop make it stop man
make it stop okay so there was about a
month where the hashtag resistance went
nuts and teamed up with Glenn Beck and
acted like he is the same person on the
right because he's anti Trump and I
remember Glenn Beck and Samantha bee
joyously acting like they're allies and
the entire time I was warning everybody
don't do it why would you do it because
Glenn Beck made crystal clear from early
on he wasn't against Trump for any
substantive reasons in fact he was for
everything that's owed iasts about
Donald Trump all of the insane far-right
policies he supported but the only thing
he didn't like about Trump what well
number one his guy lost Ted Cruz lost
and on that alone you should know like
why would I trust this guy oh he wasn't
for the buffoon Donald Trump but he was
for the authoritarian theocratic or
purchased warmonger that is Ted Cruz the
guy who doesn't have a single honest
bone in his body he's disingenuous and
smug to his core this guy totally
supported him so why would you team up
with with him to be against Trump
because obviously he's not against Trump
for substantive reasons and that's the
point he wasn't he didn't like how Trump
you know hey you're a little too mean to
people on Twitter why don't you try to
cut the social safety net and wage
endless war and destroy our regulatory
system why don't you do that with a
smile
and in Flowery words on Twitter so that
was his objection to Trump from the
beginning and I was warning everybody
how the [ __ ] could you team up with a
guy like this but they did they teamed
up with him and then now of course it
comes back to bite them in the ass
because look at him so and the thing
that's so amazing about Glenn Beck is
literally everything he said there are
the exact reasons why Trump is like the
worst but he's using the worst things
about him to try to pretend like hey no
this is why he's the best so let's break
it down first of all the ms-13 comments
this is more of the disingenuous
[ __ ] that I was talking about when I
covered that story I listen I listen to
that clip I played it for you guys twice
my interpretation that clip is very
simple it's a Rorschach test the way
everything was framed and the way it was
worded the person talking to Trump
brings up ms-13 so it's conceivable that
when Trump calls them animals he is
referring to ms-13 but at the same time
Trump used language here I'll tell you
exactly what he said Trump said quote we
have people coming in we're taking
people out you wouldn't believe how bad
these people are these people are not
people they're animals so he could have
when she said ms-13 he could have said
we have people coming in meaning not
ms-13 but just the people coming in
they're animals so the left's
interpretation is oh my god
he's talking about all undocumented
immigrants the rights interpretation is
he's talking just about ms-13 don't be
disingenuous but I think anybody who has
a strong opinion on this is being
disingenuous because it's like no he
could have easily meant whatever the
opposite is of what you think he meant
so there you go Glenn Beck I'm so sure
he only meant ms-13 maybe but it's also
a reasonable interpretation that he
meant all undocumented immigrants so
this is the straw that broke the camel's
back for him this is the straw cuz oh my
god the media is so bad
I agree the media's bad but this is the
thing that made you finally go you know
what I was against the guy completely
now I flip to be in favor of him then he
goes through the record oh boy when he
moved the embassy to Jerusalem so in
other words the move that is in part
responsible for sparking peaceful
protests from Palestinians that led to
Israeli snipers killing people killing
women killing children killing peaceful
protesters the worst that any
Palestinians did was burn some tires and
threw some rocks or used slingshots and
they got massacred over 60 Palestinians
massacre 2,000 injured nearly 2,000
injured and Glenn Beck thinks it's
awesome why does he think it's awesome
because Donald Trump is fulfilling
Biblical prophecy now Glenn Beck is a
Mormon but he's so close with all these
fundamentalist Christians like John
Hagee he loves these guys Robert Jeffers
so he loves the fact that Trump is doing
the bidding of fundamentalist Christians
he loves the fact that he's doing the
bidding of ultra extremist Zionists and
Orthodox Jews he loves that this is a
policy which serves the far-right
fundamentalists so it creates
devastation it creates war it creates
needless deaths it creates conflict it's
a giant [ __ ] you two Palestinians and
the idea is now you're never gonna get
your own state but he loves it he loves
it cuz [ __ ] Palestinians and their human
rights
I love the far-right fundamentalist it's
all Israel's so one of the worst things
about Trump he's like that's why I love
him defeating Isis please my ass cheeks
no mention the Syrian government no
mention of the Kurds no mention the Shia
militias no mention of Hezbollah none of
it none of it and so people on the
ground have been fighting Isis and in
fact we've bombed the people fighting
Isis when we bomb the Syrian government
twice but somehow we still get credit
Wow look at how that works the Paris
climate agreement pull out again one of
the worst things he did the Paris
climate agreement should be much
stronger to fight back against climate
change it's a weak agreement in the
first place and we're the only country
that pulled out of it everybody else is
in it so we're [ __ ] over the earth he
loves it he [ __ ] loves it cuz he's a
dumbass he remember he's in agenda21
conspiracy nut - and then the oh he
stopped the TPP well first of all no he
didn't because he's been in the
renegotiation of NAFTA he's been
slipping
the provisions of the TPP right back
into it now furthermore there were just
articles recently about how Trump is
like hey maybe we jump back into the to
the TPP why because he realized oh it's
a regional domination issue so the US
wants to dominate and not have China get
more control China wants more control so
Trump was against TPP until now he's
being told by elites like no no you
should really jump back in it so that
China doesn't dominate the region and so
he's like oh okay maybe we jump back in
so he doesn't have a principled stand on
this [ __ ] come on man how stupid can you
be
and furthermore Glenn Beck was a guy who
was always in favor of free trade always
always always under the Bush
administration 100% for free trade every
time they signed a free trade agreement
a Glenn Beck loved it so what happened I
thought you were mister you know uh
right-wing libertarian economics all
let's do all the free trade agreements
but now what all of a sudden you're
against TPP that's a [ __ ] first shock
maybe Glenn Beck is really a vapid
soulless shock-jock [ __ ] who only
wants recognition and then he brings up
North Korea now by the way those talks
all but fell through their reports now
the Kim jong-un pulled out of it why
because he was again the idea that he's
gonna actually give up nukes laughable
Gaddafi gave up nukes and now Gaddafi's
dead so what he's gonna trust the u.s.
when we say hey give us your nukes and
you'll be good of course he's not gonna
give up his nukes he'll make some sort
of concession but will the u.s. accept
whatever concession he makes okay here
take one test site whatever the
concession is I don't know but we'll the
Trump accept it I hope he accepts it but
it looks like the talks might fall
through now so and by the way again no
credit to the South Korean president
who's been absolutely phenomenal and
been a genius in dealing with this
there's been articles about how he knows
what he's doing and he's Pro piece but
he's also stroking Trump's ego to make
Trump feel like he's responsible for all
the good that's happening so you got the
the South Korean president the new South
Korean president the old one was
impeached over corruption the new one
comes in he's a peace candidate and he's
trying to do all the right things and he
gets no credit of course because Glenn
Beck's a [ __ ] myopic idiot who doesn't
know his ass from his elbow and then
finally tax cuts of course there you go
so the tax bill were a tea
three percent of the benefits went to
the top 1% the tax bill where they cut
the corporate tax rate from thirty five
percent to twenty one percent at a time
when corporations already paying a
historically low percentage of the tax
burden the tax bill that gutted the
estate tax so the tax bill that was
massively biased in favor of the elites
raises taxes on everybody making $75,000
a year or less over a ten year period
that tax bill which by the way had what
about a twenty two percent favorability
rating glenn beck's like that's the
reason why Trump is good now I would
have gone further in other words he
would have made the bill even shittier
but now how great is it so listen
there's a lesson in this don't for for
partisan tribalist [ __ ] reasons
don't make alliances with scumbags and
cretins because that's what Glenn Beck
is and if this doesn't prove it to you
nothing will the blaze is on the verge
of going totally under in fact there
were talks about ben shapiro was in
talks to maybe buy the blaze and glenn
beck has been hemorrhaging money
he was hemorrhaging money even before he
came out full anti-trump terrible
business model overspent so and really
not that popular he wasn't that popular
even before he went antitrump now he's
really I mean he pissed off at least
half of the people who listened to him
more than that probably because Trump
has like eighty-five percent approval
rating among Republicans so this also
could be viewed as perhaps a cynical
business move of like [ __ ] man we're so
hopeless we got a bunch of establishment
Pat's on the back in the New York Times
did a glowing profile back when he
turned anti Trump but now okay just do
another switcheroo and try to get back
your core audience who you pissed off
you were hemorrhaging money now you got
on now on mr. Pro Trump because maybe
that will save my business so there's
that's the other angle to this as well
is that this could be just a cynical
ploy for business reasons because his
business is in a hell of a lot of
trouble
Jordan Peterson and Michael Eric Dyson
debated the issue of political
correctness and it got pretty heated and
pretty interesting let's watch and then
I want to give you guys my take so I
want to come to you on those great
Michelle on Jordan's point about how
does he in a sense get an equal voice in
this debate back if it is implied that
his participation brings with it this
baggage of white privilege that doesn't
allow him to see clearly the issues that
are before us but that is to be
complicit in the very problem itself
terminologically your beginning at a
point there's already productive and
controversial you saying how can he get
here's the quality bag who are you
talking about Jordan Peterson trending
number one on Twitter
Jordan Peterson internationals in an
international bestseller I want him to
tweet something out about me in my book
Jordan Peterson right this is what I'm
saying to you why the rage bruh
you're doing well but you're a mean man
right man and you're gonna get us right
and I have never seen so much lying and
snowflake King there's enough whining
here to start a vineyard and what I'm
saying to you
empirically and precisely when you ask
the question about white privilege the
fact that you ask it in the way you did
dismissive pseudo-scientific
non-empirical and without justification
a the truth is that white privilege
doesn't act according to quantifiable
segments it's about the degree to which
we are willing as a society to grapple
with the ideals of freedom justice and
equality upon which is base number two
was interesting to me you're talking
about not having a collective identity
what do you call a nation are you
Canadian are you Canadian by yourself
are you an individual are you part of a
group when America formed its union it
did so in opposition to another group so
the reality is is that those who are
part of group identities and politics
denied the legitimacy and validity of
those groups
and the fact that they have been created
thusly and then have resentment against
others all I'm asking for is the
opportunity that this the the quotation
you talk about the difference between a
couple quality of outcome and equality
of opportunity that's a state and
retried argument hackneyed phrase
derived from the halcyon days of the
debate over affirmative action are you
looking for outcomes that can be
determined equally or are you looking
for opportunity if you free a person
after a whole long time of oppression
and say now you are free to survive if
you have no skills if you have no
quantifiable means of existence what you
have done is liberated them into
oppression and all I'm suggesting to you
Lyndon Baines Johnson one of our great
president said if you start a man in a
race a hundred years behind it is
awfully difficult to catch up so I don't
think Jordan Peterson is suffering from
anything except an exaggerated sense of
entitlement and resentment and his own
privilege is invisible to him and it's
manifest with lethal intensity and
ferocity right here on stage
responded
well what I derived from that series of
rebuttals let's say is twofold
the first is that saying that the
radical left goes too far when they
engage in violence is not a sufficient
response by any stretch of the
imagination because there are sets of
ideas in radical leftist thinking that
led to the catastrophes of the 20th
century and that was at the level of
idea not at the level of violent action
it's a very straightforward thing to say
you're against violence it's like being
against poverty it's like you know
general generic Lee speaking decent
people are against poverty and violence
doesn't address the issue in the least
and with regards to my privilege or lack
thereof I mean I'm not making the case
that I haven't had advantages in my life
and disadvantages in my life like most
people you don't know anything about my
background or where I came from it it
doesn't matter to you because
fundamentally I'm a mean white man
that's a hell of a thing to say in a
debate
very very breeze I want to move on to
men and women the mean man white comment
was not predicated upon my historical
excavation of your past its based upon
the evident vitriol with which you speak
and the denial of a sense of equanimity
among combatants in an argument
so I'm saying again you're a mean man
white man and the viciousness is
evidence okay
who is that well I think I'm I'm going
to point out two things again the first
is that my question about when the red
when the left goes too far still hasn't
been answered and then the second thing
I'm going to point out is that you know
it's conceivable that I am a mean man
you know I mean maybe I'm meaner than
some people and not as mean as others I
think that's probably more the case but
I would say the fact that race got
dragged into that particular comment is
a better exemplar of what the hell I
think is wrong with the politically
correct left and anything else that
could have possibly happened ok so just
so everybody knows this is just one
little snippet in a much much much
longer debate and this is one that this
is an exchange that people seem to be
talking about quite a lot more so I
wanted to play it on this show and then
give you my take on it but go check out
the rest of the debate for the full
context and you could see you know who
you agree with more in the overall
debate Jordan Peterson Michael Eric
Dyson or the others on the stage there
Stephen Fry is one I don't remember who
the other one is on the and and the
debate setup is a little funky because
it's like they're debating political
correctness the idea of political
correctness and I guess the side that
Michael Eric Dyson is supposed to take
that the the left is supposed to take is
that political correctness is good and
the side that Jordan Peterson and
Stephen Fry on is the idea that
political correctness is bad so I you
know I think that that's a little bit of
a silly debate to have in the first
place because in my you know in my
experience almost everybody agrees that
political correctness is bad but the the
debate is over what really constitutes
political correctness like what is
political correctness like where are the
where are the lines of political
correctness and so what's a substantive
political point versus what is a point
that's just you know it's a it's
politically correct nonsense and we
should reject it so I find the setup of
the debate a little weird because you
know in my mind right up front I would
have a massive bias in favor of the
people who would call themselves the
right in this debate Jordan Pederson and
and Stephen Fry because I feel like
political correctness is clearly
something we all disagree with it's just
the question is what constitutes
political correctness
so I find it strange that they got you
know somebody to try to defend the whole
notion of political correctness to say
it's like a good thing but okay let me
digress from that and let's jump into
the substance of it I I don't like
either one of these guys Michael Eric
Dyson is is kind of a just standard
Democrat with establishment
sensibilities he's basically the
opposite of a guy like Cornel West I
consider Cornel West to actually care
deeply about the policy substance and
improving people's lives I consider a
guy like Michael Eric Dyson a little bit
of a charlatan he you know he just is
run-of-the-mill establishment kind of
Democrat and I do think that a guy like
Michael Eric Dyson has an over reliance
on identity politics which I don't think
is fruitful and I don't think it makes
sense now I also don't really like
Jordan Peterson
I actually what I don't mind about
Jordan Peterson is his like self-help
stuff because I think that that actually
helps a lot of people and I see no harm
in it whatsoever I think it's relatively
benign the self-help stuff but where I
disagree with Jordan Peterson is you
know his he's a very religious guy and
he's made some comments that I would
consider ridiculous about religion and
his comments that I've seen on politics
are also just kind of run-of-the-mill
right-wing politics which I'm not saying
he's not a smart guy I think he is a
smart guy but at the same time I think
his politics are silly now I'm not going
to go too much into context of that
right now I'll do separate segments
going into more details about what I
think about of specific ideas of Jordan
Pederson in the political sphere but so
let's talk about the angry white man
back and forth now the the people Jordan
Peterson is Stephen Fry and people who
are broadly on the right in this
exchange their argument goes something
like this for you to call me an angry
white man is hypocritical because if I
called you an angry black man
you would immediately tar me is racist
and say you just you know hey
conversation over because you've
declared that you're outside of the
realm of respectable discussion and so
you deserve nothing but shame from
society and scorn and you're not a
legitimate voice because how dare you
you know use such a character attack to
call me an angry black man and I think
what a guy like Jordan Peterson and
Stephen Fry might say is like you don't
see the double standard there and how
that's a problem how people on the Left
get to use identity politics non-stop
but then when somebody on the right uses
it you immediately declare that that's
out of bounds and not fair how if
somebody calls you an angry black man
that's racist but if you call me an
angry white man for whatever reason
that's not considered racist and it's
just considered like you're keeping it
real or whatever so that is the argument
on the right as far as I can see is
there truth in that I think there's a
grain of truth in that at the same time
I think though that guys like Jordan
Peterson and maybe Stephen Fry I don't
know for sure
they might downplay the historical
differences in power and that's
something that the left points out and
it's I think it's somewhat accurate when
they pointed out because you know if you
have identity politics black identity
politics in the context of the u.s. now
I'm generally an opponent of identity
politics but that doesn't mean that
white identity politics is equal to by
default black identity politics because
historically because of the power
difference in the u.s. because of the
fact that we've had one group is the
majority and they have all the power and
you had slavery and then you had
segregation and Jim Crow and then now
you have what they call the new Jim Crow
which is the drug war being used as
proportionately to crack down on black
folks because of the power difference
black identity politics manifests itself
as ultimately a movement for equality
and a movement for justice and a
movement to redress the grievances and
make it equal now that doesn't mean that
all black identity politics is like that
in fact there are black supremacists you
know strains of
but Malcolm X originally was a black
supremacist and he was open about that
you know he didn't like White's he
thought they were literal Devils but
then later on in his life he became a
little bit more like MLK character and
really was fighting for equality so if
you have you know black identity
politics fighting for equality to
redress the grievances and make it equal
that is something that's very different
from a black supremacist philosophy
which says blacks are superior to whites
or a white identity politics because
historically in in the context of a
place like the US where white people
have most of the power white identity
politics manifests as you know a
neo-nazi movie or the movement or the
KKK or you know extremists it manifests
as hate groups that say we should have
all the power because we're better than
you so there's a double standard and I
the double standard is a real issue so
they the right has a point when they say
how come you could call me an angry
white man but I can't call you an angry
black man there is a point they're like
hey there's a double standard but then
there also is to an extent a reason for
the double standard and it's the
historical power historical power
difference now but my ultimate take away
on that honestly is I think that they I
think that that double standard still is
a problem I do because I think it's just
inevitable that if you have that
difference in identity politics where
one side says we get to play identity
politics the left does but they say hey
if the right plays identity politics
that's out of bounds I don't think that
I don't think that's sustainable because
I think in that situation you will have
a backlash of the rise of something like
the alright now that's not saying that
there aren't people who are on the
alt-right who we're gonna be alright
douchebags and white supremacist no
matter what because I think there are
people who are gonna be white
supremacist no matter what no matter
what arguments the left are making but I
just don't want to buy into the logic of
identity politics because once
by into the logic of identity politics
you don't get to determine who plays it
you know so but then also I would say
that doesn't mean that there aren't
legitimate concerns for minority
communities and specifically minority
communities in the US it's not like they
don't have concerns that other groups
don't have they do have some concerns
that other groups don't have or
certainly don't have to the same extent
now the other aspect of that I thought
was interesting the angry white man
reaction is so while I kind of disagree
with Michael Eric Dyson and that I do
think he shouldn't have said that
because it is true that there's like a
double standard he can kind of casually
call Jordan Peterson angry white man but
Jordan Peterson can't call him an angry
black man but what's interesting though
is that Jordan Peterson really did get
like triggered and melted like a
snowflake and there let's be clear here
there is you know uh there is some I
don't know what the right word for it is
it's just funny that the guy who who
cloaks himself as like we're all about
free speech were all about not shutting
down debate not shutting down discussion
a free exchange of ideas anything goes
but then when somebody calls you
something you don't like you kind of
shut down and it's obvious that he's
really affected by it and he's like he
seems like he's kind of shutting down
debate like he his responses became kind
of short and he was like offended by it
and it's like what happened I thought
you were the non offended guy like here
let me put it this way if I was in
Jordan Peterson's position and Michael
Eric Dyson called me an angry white man
I wouldn't have reacted like shocked and
appalled and offended and turned into a
snowflake I would have you know whatever
responded on the merits of it because in
all seriousness on the merits of it I
don't think that's totally incorrect
about Jordan Peterson and you know he
goes on to talk about how yeah perhaps
I'm angry but the fact that you
mentioned race is a problem well no it's
actually just an accurate descriptor
like you are white and perhaps you are
angry so truth is always a defense so
there might actually be a level of truth
in that so I just find it funny that the
anti snowflake guy turned into a
snowflake when he heard a description of
him that he didn't like okay all right
now to the broader question of white
privilege it does
my privilege exists and if it exists is
there merit in pointing it out all the
time to the first question does it exist
I would say yes but to the second
question I would say no not really so in
other words I think white privilege
exists in the sense that on average it
is harder for a black person in the
United States of America and a majority
of white society than it is for a white
person and there's countless examples of
this there's a lot of evidence to this
effect you know the resume study is
probably the best example when you have
the exact same resume and a black name
on the resume versus a white name on the
resume the white name gets way more
callbacks than the black name everything
being equal the white name is way more
preferred than the black name so that
shows that you know race is a very it's
it's an important factor even though we
like to pretend like we already live in
this colorblind utopia where race is not
a factor it is a factor so I do think
that the resume studies evidence that
white privilege exists I think the fact
that the drug war is disproportionately
used to crack down on minorities is
another example that white privilege
does exist because you know black people
and white people use drugs at a similar
rate black people get a rest of her four
times more often another interesting
fact is white people are way more likely
than black people to sell drugs
but black people are way more likely to
get arrested for selling drugs than
white people so there are certain
instances of there's really no other
explanation other than race for why
certain things happen application of the
death penalty application of mandatory
minimum sentences all of this is
evidence that yes there's a
disproportionate crackdown on minority
communities so to an extent does white
privilege exists yes but why do I think
it's not at all fruitful to discuss it
here's why because when when a poor
white family who has no money and no
power keeps hearing you know the idea of
white privilege being brought up they I
think correctly think well that I
not privilege by any stretch of the
imagination listen guys the overwhelming
majority of white people in this country
also have no money and no power and are
screwed by a system that's [ __ ] them
over as well as [ __ ] over minorities
now again on average the degree to which
they're getting [ __ ] over is slightly
different but the more important point
that unifies all of us I think is class
consciousness so poor white families
from Appalachia have a lot more in
common with minority communities that
are oppressed then everybody thinks they
do so we're all in the same boat listen
if you're if you're middle a middle
class white family or a middle-class
black family and you go down the
economic ladder to lower middle class to
poor the same policies that would help
the middle class white family are the
same policies that would help the middle
class black family are the same policies
that would help the poor white people
and the poor black people and the poor
minority communities so I think as a
general rule the solutions to problems
that might plague minority communities
more are still universal solutions so in
other words if you if somebody harps
away on the idea of white privilege
white privilege white privilege white
privilege even if they're not saying hey
so this story is about a week old but I
feel compelled to cover it because it
blew up so much and there are so many
varying opinions on it well actually
it's not that there are so many varying
opinions is that there are two camps
that are really convinced of what
they're saying and they've been barking
back and forth and of course what I'm
referring to is Donald Trump using the
word animals so Democrats by and large
are saying well he was referring to all
undocumented immigrants and so what a
[ __ ] crazy person he is to call all
undocumented immigrants animals and then
Republicans are saying no you're being
disingenuous he was referring to ms-13
specifically so don't try to make it
like you're you're making a mountain out
of a molehill and you're taking him out
of context to try to score political
points well I wanted to give everybody
the full context then give you my
breakdown of it and see where the truth
lies
I cannot tell ice about them we have
people coming into the country of trying
to come in we're stopping a lot of them
but we're taking people out of the
country you wouldn't believe how bad
these people are these aren't people
these are animals and we're taking them
out of the country at a level and at a
rate that's never happened before and
because of the weak laws they come in
fast we get them we release them we get
them again we bring them out it's crazy
the dumbest laws as I said before the
dumbest laws on immigration in the world
okay so I want to play it one more time
and just try to try to follow every
aspect of it from the beginning to the
end and you know you make a
determination in your mind whether you
think he was referring to ms-13 or if
he's referring to all undocumented
immigrants watch
there will be an ms-13 gang member I
know about if they don't we just the
best certain threshold
I cannot tell ice about them we have
people coming into the country of trying
to come in we're stopping a lot of them
but we're taking people out of the
country you wouldn't believe how bad
these people are these aren't people
these are animals and we're taking them
out of the country at a level and at a
rate that's never happened before and
because of the weak laws they come in
fast we get him we release him we get
him again we bring them out it's crazy
the dumbest laws as I said before the
dumbest laws on immigration in the world
so he says she refers to ms-13 and I
think that's a sheriff talking to him
right there if I'm not mistaken and you
know earlier on in her comment she you
could tell she's very right-leaning and
she's talking about how oh my goodness
the ice officers don't get to do
whatever they want that's so terrible
and that's unfair and we're trying to
keep the streets safe but you know we
need more leeway to basically do
whatever the [ __ ] we want
and so she references ms-13 Trump says
quote we have people coming in we're
taking people out you wouldn't believe
how bad these people are these people
aren't people these are animals so quote
we have people coming in we're taking
people out you wouldn't believe how bad
these people are these people aren't
people they're animals so listen to me
when I hear that I honestly think this
is a Rorschach test
for how one feels about Trump because if
you're if you're being kind in your
interpretation and I know to be fair I
don't think it's an outlandish
interpretation you could say well she
referenced ms-13 she clearly did and
then he took that comment and just added
on to that comment and was like you're
right these people coming into the
country he could mean these people as in
ms-13 coming into the country they're
animals but then it's
so not an outlandish interpretation to
say she references ms-13 and then when
he starts talking he's not like adding
on to the ms-13 point he's saying quote
we have people coming in we're taking
people out you wouldn't believe how bad
these people are these people aren't
people they're animals so when she
mentions ms-13 and then he says we have
people coming in we're taking people out
they're not people they're animals that
that could mean like yeah the people
coming in so like all of the people
coming in are animals so to me what I
find [ __ ] fascinating is honestly how
disingenuous everybody's being over this
because it I've seen Democrats who are
like nope 100 percent he's talking about
all undocumented immigrants and that's
the end of the conversation and if you
disagree you're being disingenuous and
then I've seen Republicans and in fact I
think we're gonna cover one of these
stories later in the show because it's
[ __ ] preposterous
you know like Alex Jones for example
people who lean to the right who are
like Democrats love ms-13 what No stop
you clearly what they're saying is they
think he's you know referring to all
undocumented immigrants when he says
these people are animals now you
disagree and you think he said ms-13 but
don't mischaracterize them you know
there's a lot of like a lot of in
right-wing circles they're like the left
keeps defending ms-13 today they're on
the side of ms-13 tonight like no stop
with your [ __ ] that's such a hacky thing
to say cuz it's obvious nobody on the
left is like I love ms-13 no they're
like we think he was referring to all
undocumented immigrants when he said
that not ms-13 so when we say hey you're
[ __ ] up mr. president it's not like
we're saying you're [ __ ] up for
calling ms-13 animals as we're saying
you're [ __ ] up for calling all
undocumented immigrants animals so I
this is the ultimate Rorschach test
about Donald Trump and you know my my
reading of the situation
that I see a lot of disingenuous nasaw
louver the place where people on the
left are acting like it is impossible to
interpret Trump's statement as anything
other than he was referring to all
undocumented immigrants and I don't
think that's true
and then people on the right are acting
like all Democrats are now loved ms-13
no they think he's referring to all
undocumented immigrants now that's not
the end of the commentary on this though
because to me the main point is honestly
it doesn't even matter that much but the
specific rhetoric here I mean we're
literally arguing over semantics that's
what this is we're talking about exactly
did he Ward it and what exactly did he
mean now he's come out and said I was
referring to ms-13
so stop saying was referring to all
undocumented immigrants however to me
all that matters at the end of the day
is what the policy and so I don't give a
[ __ ] what you were saying there I care
about what you're doing and when you
look at what Trump is doing well that's
where everything that's really
objectionable comes into play so take a
look at this how Trump changed the rules
to arrest more non criminal immigrants
so they go on to explain the Trump
signed an executive order that basically
makes it so that there is no priority on
undocumented immigrants who are also
criminals now it's hey if it's just any
undocumented immigrant you can deport
them and you should deport them so okay
I have a problem with that I don't agree
with that policy I have no problem
whatsoever with deporting you know
undocumented immigrants who are violent
criminals no problem with that
whatsoever and I honestly think most
people on the Left don't have a problem
with that but do I have a problem with
somebody who's an undocumented immigrant
who's a law-abiding citizen who hasn't
really done anything wrong yes you know
earning a living and taking care of
their family and and doing their thing
do I want that person deported [ __ ] no I
don't want that person deported well
Donald Trump signed an executive order
that said yes I'm fine I it's fine with
deporting people like that so I don't
care about what you said
I care about what you're doing and what
you're doing on that front is terrible
so you are actually treating all
undocumented immigrants like they're
animals if that's your policy and I
totally totally disagree with that
policy now furthermore Donald Trump is
the guy who came out and said on the
campaign trail that he wants a quote
total and complete shutdown of Muslims
coming into the country total and
complete shutdown of Muslims total and
complete total and complete so that's
Donald Trump saying yeah I all Muslims I
don't want you coming into the country
total and complete shutdown so the idea
that we're even debating at this point
whether or not this guy is a bigot
I mean it's it's laughable now also look
at what he said during the launch of his
campaign he said quote they're bringing
drugs they're bringing crime they're
rapists and some I assume are good
people that's a direct quote they're
bringing drugs they're bringing crime
they're rapists and some I assume are
good people
so that's one of those comments where I
always mention it he flipped it he
flipped it if Donald Trump said hey
people coming into this country some of
them are bringing drugs some of them are
bringing crime some of them are rapists
I would actually defend him on that
front but because that's true and of any
group some are not gonna be great people
but he flipped it and he said they're
bringing drugs they're bringing crime
they're rapists and some I assume are
good people so that's him saying yeah
they're mostly bad people but some are
good no that's obviously a bigoted
comment and if you don't see it you're
being dense on purpose and then we don't
even need to get into the rest of the
the the other history of it the Central
Park five and that whole fiasco where he
called for the death penalty because
there were minorities who were accused
of rape or something of that effect
turns out they were all innocent when
Trump was told about that he said I
don't care kill him anyway
there was birtherism I mean that's kind
of how he came to prominence in the
realm of politics specifically he kept
talking about birtherism
oh the first black president he's not
American even though he's showed his
birth his short form birth certificate
his long-form birth certificate his
[ __ ] college records everything
imaginable a [ __ ] newspaper clipping
from the time when he was born
announcing his birth in Hawaii never
mattered gee I wonder why could it be
because this president has dark skin
meanwhile John McCain was born on a
[ __ ] military base in Panama he
wasn't born in America and everybody
gave him a pass you know it was no big
deal but Bhama I don't know he looks
kind of different and then of course
there's a nationwide stop and frisk
which he called for which by the way
it's well over 99% ineffective but he
called for nationwide stop and frisk and
by the way they disproportionately
cracked down on black people and
Hispanic people
so cracks down on minorities totally
ineffective but takes away their Fourth
Amendment rights I wonder if that's a
bigoted policy and of course he was sued
over [ __ ] housing discrimination he
was sued over housing discrimination
well documented cases of them
effectively redlining and you know
trying to not have black people in their
buildings this goes back to I think the
80s was it the 80s or the 70s but see
this is to me what matters is the policy
so when you argue over the semantics and
when you guys split hairs and you know
Democrats are saying the problem is he
called a you know undocumented
immigrants all undocumented immigrants
animals to me that's not as important as
because there is a question as to
whether or not he really meant ms-13 and
you may have just met ms-13 but to me
the real thing the Democrats should be
bringing up is regardless of what you
said there your immigration policy
change the rules to arrest more non
criminal immigrants so regardless of
what you said about undocumented
immigrants you are trying to deport all
the undocumented immigrants or certainly
your policy is that that you're not
prioritizing criminals so I don't agree
with what you're doing and treating all
undocumented immigrants like they're bad
so I would focus more on the policy than
the rhetoric because the policy
ultimately is what matters so but you're
not going to hear the end of this listen
man this story's about a week old but I
decided to cover it because I was just
so tired
of I mean the number of [ __ ] tweets I
read and the number of [ __ ] people
I've seen who's like no he said he said
ms-13 no we said on document immigrants
all undocumented migrants know we said
ms-13 and the whole time I'm sitting
there listening like I actually can see
both interpretations of that and pretty
clearly I can see both interpretations
of that but ultimately why are we not
talking about what he's actually doing
and then by the way final point is yes
Donald Trump signed the executive order
that makes it so that you know all
undocumented immigrants are fair game to
get rid of and it's not just criminals
there's not a focus I should say on
criminals but let me be clear about
something else in his first year in
office Trump's first year in office
he actually deported fewer undocumented
immigrants then Obama did in his last
year in office so and that's an
inconvenient fact that Democrats don't
like to talk about but it's true
you know Obama would have the nickname
that DePorter in chief because he kept
deporting people so you know I think if
we're gonna crack down on Trump for his
shitty immigration policies which I
agree with by the way I obviously don't
agree with his immigration policies I
think we should be intellectually honest
and consistent and talk about how that
doesn't mean Obama was good that doesn't
mean the Democrats are good it just
means that Trump is shitty and the
Democrats were pretty shitty too so
listen in my mind the proper immigration
policy is I would I have no problem
deporting violent criminals
who are undocumented immigrants no
problem at all but outside of that if
you're an undocumented immigrant and
you're not a criminal or if you're an
undocumented immigrant and you're a non
violent criminal like it some sort of
drug conviction I don't care
leave them alone they're regular people
just like you and me just living their
lives so what aren't annoying back and
forth that it's been happening in the
country splitting hairs and arguing over
some
convicted criminal Oliver North who sold
illegal weapons to Iran you know he was
a key figure in the iran-contra scandal
he's now working with the NRA
and he went on Fox News to respond to
the most recent mass school shooting
that we had we seem to have won like
once a month this one happened in Santa
Fe where 10 people were killed let's see
what he had to say about this and what
policy prescriptions he proposes it was
what do you say to young people like
that who have come to expect shootings
in their schools they shouldn't have to
they shouldn't be afraid to go to school
they shouldn't work at the fact that
they might not go home that night
because some crazed person comes in with
a firearm which is one of the reasons
why the NRA for over two years has been
advocating a program called school
shield there's finally legislation for
it Thanks there's 75 to 100 million
dollars appropriated by the federal
government to assist in it but if school
shield had been in place in Santa Fe
High School far less likely that that
would have happened the the problem that
we've got is we're trying like the
dickens to treat the symptom without
treating the disease and the disease in
this case isn't the Second Amendment
the disease is youngsters who are
steeped in a culture of violence they've
been drugged in many cases nearly all of
these perpetrators are male and they're
young teenagers in most cases and
they've come through a culture where
violence is commonplace what we need to
do is turn on a TV go to a movie if you
look at what has happened to the young
people many of these young boys have
been on ritalin since they were in
kindergarten now I am certainly not a
doctor I'm a marine but I can see those
kinds of things happening and
endangering those two gals specific
because this was the 16th 16th school
shooting so far this year that is the
most at this point of the year since
they start
keeping records after Columbine in 1999
to three key specific things that you
think would keep our children safe
well what school shield would because
school shell which is what it's it's a
program in the NRA introduced it two
years ago it's a will go do an
assessment cost the school nothing costs
the taxpayers nothing to get the
assessment as to what the issues are in
terms of ingress/egress the ability to
hide a firearm and get it into a school
the number of school resource officers
you really need in very few schools
actually have that but let's just talk
about that specific let me if I may just
talk about that specifically
this school has two policemen armed
roaming the halls the school
administrators said yesterday they
considered Santa Fe a hardened school
but there was no way to detect a firearm
being brought into the building okay you
and I came through the lobby here in
this in this building where we're
sitting right now there was a security
desk there there was a barrier for us to
pass through you can't get on an
airplane today without going through a
metal detector there's no metal detector
in our building are you suggesting that
there be a metal detector and I'm not
saying that's wrong a metal detector at
the entrance to every school for
millions and millions of schools if you
want to stop the carnage look that
you're not gonna fix it by taking away
the rights of law-abiding citizens
you've got to fix it in a way that
hardens to place sufficiently that those
kids are safe inside the door if that
means five metal detectors getting in
and out of the high school you get five
metal detectors okay Kameron Caskey one
of the park all right so first let's
talk about the multiple dodges this is
obfuscation and deflection this is what
he's doing here when he says you know
the disease here is violent movies
violent TV shows you know he implies
violent video games we live in a culture
of violence so I have a bunch of
questions for him over that the first
one is do you include you know for
example the worship of our military as
part of a violent culture how you know
at every baseball game for example it's
a showing of patriotic support
every sporting event period it's a
showing of patriotic support you know we
were in countless Wars all the time
we're bombing eight countries right now
do you consider that rampant militarism
as a part of our culture of violence my
guess is he draw a clean line around
that and say no no that's good it's good
that we're bombing eight countries to
the militarism is good what I mean is
you know the violent movies and video
games and TV shows that's the problem
well here's the problem with that pal
there is no evidence to suggest that
there's a link between violent movies
and TV shows and video games and mass
shootings in fact all of the evidence
points in the other direction there are
many countries that have the same
violent movies and video games and TV
shows and they don't have a mass
shooting epidemic like we do so you know
Japan is the perfect example they have
next to no mass shootings they have very
tight gun regulations but they have the
same video games we have same violent
video games we have so many countries
have the same violent video games and
movies and it turns out people are not
dunces they can differentiate between
watching The Walking Dead and wanting to
go shoot their neighbor Dave so I mean
what a [ __ ] pedantic condescending
shitty dodge that is like oh I'm gonna
stand up here and [ __ ] Yelp about
people's freedom but at the same time
I'm gonna imply that maybe we should
restrict the freedom to watch a violent
video game to watch a violent movie or
TV show or play a violent video game
what happened with your concern about
freedom I care about freedom unless it
allows me to deflect from guns which is
all I really care about in which case
I'll imply that maybe there should be
crackdown on those things the
entertainment angle of it because this
guy's obviously not playing [ __ ]
violent video game so he wants to come
for your violent video games while you
know maintaining a system and a policy
when it comes to guns where we don't
even have a universal background check
so [ __ ] you Oliver North and by the way
you're working for a group that lies
every time there's a mass shooting
remember the the mass shooting it was in
Vegas where the guy
wiped out I didn't know how many [ __ ]
probably over 40 people taking him out
from a hotel as they're enjoying a
concert and he was using the bump stock
and so the NRA came out after that
shooting and lied and said oh yes bum
stocks you know hey maybe these should
be regulated let's ask the ATF to
determine if there can be more
regulation in the current context well
come to find out they're mealy-mouthed
statement was nothing but a dodge
because the ATF isn't responsible for
regulating bump stocks anyway so that's
like saying hey maybe the DMV should
regulate Wall Street let's check under
current existing laws for them to crack
down well that's ridiculous because
they're not responsible for regulating
Wall Street so that's a way for them to
appear like they're in favor of
common-sense gun regulation when they're
not when they're not they're liars
that's what they are so [ __ ] you dodging
when you say video games and movies [ __ ]
off there's no link between that
violence where is there a link there is
a link between the more guns you had the
more violence you have okay now then he
goes on to Ritalin let me explain the
multiple ways now I don't know if he was
saying ritalin and really that's a
stand-in for oh there's a lot of you
know pills that I have a psychological
impact that are being prescribed so in
other words I don't know if he meant
literally Ritalin or if he's just kind
of saying that as a stand-in for all
pills
whether it's ritalin xanax or really in
most cases whenever people bring up
pills in this context they talk about
SSRIs antidepressants now let me explain
why this is preposterous aside from the
point that there's there's no evidence
for it let's say hypothetically it is
true that many of them who do this mass
shooting are prescribed these pills well
does that mean that when they did the
shooting they took the pills or does
that mean that when they did the
shooting they didn't take their
necessary psychological medication and
that's why they did the shooting you
understand the problem we have here so
is the problem that
they were prescribed the pill and they
took the pill and that's what made them
do the shooting or is the problem that
they were prescribed the pill and they
should have taken the pill but they
didn't take the pill and the fact that
they didn't take the pill made them do
the shooting like they should have been
on their meds they were off their meds
and that's what led to the shooting
so that's not like that's a really
really really kind of layman's armchair
pontificating response to this kind of
stuff I don't know the pills are
something know if we're gonna have a
conversation about this stuff stick to
the data stick to the facts
stick to the studies and of course there
was a Harvard meta-analysis done on this
of all the studies and they said where
there are more guns there is more gun
violence now that doesn't mean that you
know the oh we should ban guns and
that's the end of the conversation no
but it doesn't mean that we should be
having you know a debate about which
exact gun regulation should we do that
would make our system make more sense
and yes you can balance the idea of
protecting law-abiding citizens freedom
to have a gun but also balance it with
the idea of public safety and what kind
of gun should be allowed and what kind
of magazines should be allowed and what
kind of background check system should
we have and how comprehensive should it
be and who should we ban from getting
guns within that background check system
but we're not even having that
reasonable discussion because idiots
like this come out there and deflect an
obfuscated and then you know make up
[ __ ] like I don't know Ritalin or
something pills violent video games and
movies and then listen when when we get
to the police stated to the the solution
really what he's referring to as a
police state he's saying we should
basically have you know metal detectors
absolutely everywhere and we should have
like security out the wazoo everywhere
we go but as Chris Wallace pointed out
in this particular shooting this school
had two armed guards and it didn't stop
the shooting now that doesn't mean armed
guards are definitely the wrong way to
go it just means that if you point to
that
as a fix in an instance where we had
that in place that doesn't seem like it
makes all that much sense now I'm not
against the issue of the the idea of
some armed guards but I don't think
that's a cure-all by the same token I
don't think gun regulation is a cure-all
I just think that in the aggregate it
would tick down the statistics it would
take down the instances of gun violence
whether we cut at twenty percent or
fifty percent or whatever it may be I
think that all helps I would be willing
in a compromised bill to take the right
wing idea of having an armed guard or
something and mix that with actual
common sense gun reform like universal
background checks and a ban on
high-capacity magazines and things of
that nature but I do want to point out
there is one and this will be the final
point massive piece of hypocrisy in what
he's saying here that he doesn't he
doesn't recognize at all now these are
the types of people who say listen more
guns equals more peace and their
philosophy is hey the good guys there
are more good guys than bad guys so if
you arm everybody the good guys with the
guns will outnumber the bad guys with
the guns and that's why we need to arm
as many people as possible that's what a
guy like Oliver North would say that's
the NRA s position but if you notice
there he says oh my solution is
basically whatever metal detectors at
schools and more guards but my question
for Oliver North is if guns keep us safe
which is what his position is then why
would you want a metal detector to stop
people with guns from coming in if guns
keep us safe then wouldn't a metal
detector that's used to keep out guns be
the problem and the opposite of what
would keep us safe because again you say
more guns equals more peace so why would
you want a metal detector to stop people
with guns from coming into the school
and that that's the main point guys
is their logic implodes on itself
because ultimately they have to concede
on some level yes the idea is to keep
the guns out of the hands of the people
who shouldn't have the guns so since we
all really admit to that even though
sometimes they don't say it that they
admit to that step number one needs to
be a rigid universal background check
with strict standards as to who's
allowed to have a gun and who's not
allowed to have a gun and again that
won't stop all mass shootings bill
certainly tick them down for sure
because the idea is you disincentivize
the people who shouldn't have a gun from
getting a gun some of them will be able
to go on the black market and get a gun
anyway for sure but many of them won't
probably the overwhelming majority of
them won't because who the [ __ ] casually
has connections to the black market like
that so their logic implodes on itself
too and that's just something to keep in
mind if more guns equals more peace then
why would you want a metal detector to
keep out the guns wouldn't you want more
guns in the school because ultimately
they have to concede the logic of what
we're talking about which is you have to
keep the guns out of the hands of people
who shouldn't have the guns and if you
believe in that which everybody on some
level believes in that then the answer
is gun reform now your idea of gun
reform might not go as far as my idea of
gun reform and then there's somebody
else's idea of gun reform that would
probably go further than my idea of gun
reform but let's at least be
intellectually honest and talk about how
that's the conversation we need to be
having not this [ __ ] obfuscation and
deflection and oh my god it's the
ritalin it's the pills it's the [ __ ]
violent video games and movies it's none
of those things what it is is the
weapons
hello everybody today I'm talking to
congressional candidate Amy vilela she's
a Justice Democrat running for office in
Nevada's fourth District now before I go
any further
Amy do I pronounce your last name
properly or no you do I did okay so it
is vilela cuz yeah okay all right good
because I wasn't I wasn't ever sure but
I just kept saying vilela and I was like
oh this is right but there's a lot of
stuff to talk about so she has just an
absolutely incredible personal story
she's a great candidate and there's some
stuff going on behind the scenes with
the d-triple-c in her specific race so
let's start off with first tell me about
your original opponent the the former
incumbent Ruben how do you say his
lesson kawin okay so tell me about him
explain everybody what happened with him
well you know most people know my story
that I became an activist and got
involved in politics on the link of my
daughter shall in steth and she was a
victim of our for-profit health care
system she died a needless and painful
death at the age of 22 and it really
spurred me on into activism after
meeting Nina Turner of course I got the
motivated to go out and start fighting
for Medicare for all and I had
approached many of the legislators in
our state of Nevada I really held off on
Ruben qyn because I thought that he
would be the lowest hanging fruit as he
was a member of the Progressive Caucus
so when the time came I went to a forum
and I met with him and I told him the
story in front of everyone about how she
Lin went to a local ER with every sign
and symptom and most of the risk factors
for a blood clot and was essentially
told to go get insurance and see a
specialist that they were not a doctor's
office this hospital violated and tala
which we are now in court for and I was
explaining this to him
I even went as far just to tell him that
they had to pull me away from her coffin
because I could not understand just even
comprehend never seeing my child again
and throughout this conversation he kept
on deflecting saying well I'm busy
fighting the ACA and I'm like well I'm
fighting for that to not be reversed as
well because we need to go forward and
not backwards and then he was saying how
he was busy with North Korea and then at
the very end he said you know I didn't I
heard your story today I didn't have to
be here I could've been out enjoying my
weekend and I decided that I was going
to primary Rubin he won because he ran
on the promises that health care was a
human right and then switched it up to
health insurance is a human right so
those are two very different things
and I felt that he was not he's being
disingenuous and his concern for health
care and he would not budge and he also
started having other thoughts that I
really didn't agree with he was one of
the few 12 in Congress to vote to make
it easier to deport people based on
whether or not they look like they
belonged in a gang although he was a
dreamer so these were very things that
told me that he really needs to be
called out he needed to be too we need
to let him know that it was unacceptable
that his constituents were not happy
with his voting record nor a lot of
important issues when some things he's
done really well but that there were
certain issues that we just wanted him
to vote with the people that were
important enough you know and you have
35,000 people a year dying from health
care that's a really important issue to
address while you're in legislature a
legislator one of those oh I started
primary him good it was the only one at
that point so one of the big issues
where you know you could kind of tell a
wolf in sheep's clothing is this issue
of health care because it's very easy
for Democrats to look at what the
Republicans are doing and then their
reaction is well we have to protect the
Affordable Care Act and nobody on the
left
is arguing against the Affordable Care
Act what people like you were saying
what I'm saying is we need to go further
it's not you know you still have about
20 million people who are uninsured with
the Affordable Care Act and there's only
one answer that we know will work and
will cover everybody and it's Medicare
for all and I think your story is
particularly powerful because you know
to to a lot of people I think the issue
of health care is academic it's not to
you it's more than that to you so you
know that these are lives and you know
that you know when they say 38,000 to
45,000 people die every year because
they don't have access to basic health
care you know all too well that those
are real people including your daughter
so yeah I always tell people that I
don't just take a moment you know a lot
of times you know most the time I'm able
to tell the story of shillin's death and
what happened to her and keep composure
there are times I'm not able to it's
very difficult I relive her death almost
daily so that I can try to help other
people but I always tell everyone to
take a moment I mean there was a year I
didn't even want to get out of bed I
didn't want to live I didn't even know
what I want to do with my life and again
it so hadn't been for other people
leading the way like Nina and hearing
her and a convention for single-payer
her telling me you know how that you
know you have to turn that the anguish
and that despair and that hurt and to
power in action
I don't know what I would have done and
I said you know let's think about this
in real times you know conservatively
we're talking about 35,000 times the
amount of pain I the dirty and since
chalene died almost three years ago very
conservatively we're looking at 105
thousand additional deaths that's
mind-blowing to me that that were not in
more outrage in this country than we are
right the first time I read her story
and your story I cried and you know I
covered it on secular talk and
I think it went from being sad to just
angry that's really angry so you know
I'm happy that you're running and trying
to fix this because this is a real
serious issue sorry I'm choking up now I
do it every day with me I'm not supposed
to be the one crying alright I'll try
I'll try to compose myself here um okay
so that's Ruben and then correct me if
I'm wrong here he he's the one who he
dropped out right he's not running now
yes he was there was a fad for
allegations of sexual harassment brought
against ribbon
taewin and he dropped out late December
at that point I was the only one in the
race I've been in since July I announced
actually on my birthday
that was the day I announced was in July
the 17th and he didn't drop out until
December okay so you announced a primary
he drops out you're the only Democrat in
the race and then what happens well then
it got really crowded so we have I have
five opponents right now primary
opponents and one of them in particular
is a very interesting opponent he was
previously the congressman in this
district he lost to the Republican
person who's running and then he left
and living worked for a lobbying firm
and decided I guess to come back into
state when there was an opportunity that
that presented itself to run for
Congress
and so the d-triple-c is backing him
correct yes he's on the red to blue so
like it's I think you know there was
that story in the intercept the other
week that really kind of showed exactly
what the d-triple-c is doing and at this
point they're not even hiding it their
whole goal is to defeat
the insurgent progressive candidates
like yourself and to get corporatist
pro-establishment pros status-quo
candidates elected and so for example
this guy Steven Horsford he's he's
taking super PAC money correct isn't he
taking a tremendous amount of corporate
money well there are there are doing
things for him he is taking PAC money
and it's interesting now because the way
that they're doing it is okay I'm not
taking corporate money which he is also
right but the majority of the PACs now
have changed from being in the name of
corporations to now that were in
leadership PACs so now we have a ton of
leadership PACs that are a lot of them
are mainly composed of corporate money
from the industries that they're saying
that they're going to be attacking and
going after right and you said I think
about 70 grand from Big Pharma he
actually took that straight out
throughout his career okay but this this
run here it's mode it's switched over
from being corporate PACs to now those
packs were when you look at the names
they sound great and tell you look at
what money is being funneled into those
PACs and so this is where we see where I
feel that they're coming after
progressives now saying well I'm not
going to take any corporate money but
they're nicely bundled up in leadership
PACs now where it's not so obvious
what's happening unless you really start
to go in and research and follow the
money of where this money is coming from
into these leadership PACs so it's
basically like they're trying to launder
it through you know they they take the
money they bundle it together it's from
corporations and big donors but they try
to launder it so that they hide behind
you know whatever it may be Democratic
leadership something something and all
right that's a that's a really see the
thing is they're they have to get clever
now because there is this progressive
wave that's striking and you know like
you have people like Chuck Schumer and
Nancy Pelosi who
or at least you're kind of upfront about
the fact that they're not really on the
left like they'll tell you no I'm not in
favor of medicare-for-all like I don't
want that now they're wrong right
they're wrong but at least they're
honest and you know exactly who you're
dealing with with a lot of these new
people they're trying to sound like
they're on the left but at the same time
they're taking the corporate money and
they're not being honest about what
their positions are right so net and
that's a real problem because now people
are thinking well they're not they're
calling themselves grassroots I don't
know what the definition of grassroots
is for them but I can tell you it looks
very different from what the definition
I think grassroots is and what we're
actually doing and how we're running our
race right so and you know we ran into
this issue with with Paula Jean
Swearengen now she managed to get about
30% of the vote in a race where she
raised less than $200,000 and joe
Manchin raised about 6 million dollars
and you know I had mentioned she has
absolutely nothing to be ashamed about
she fought out her heart out and you
know there were some people who
responded to me on Twitter like oh stop
making excuses and all that but my
response was well listen this is exactly
what we've been saying from day one is
that money in politics is the heart of
the problem and when you hat when you're
up against six million dollars and you
only raise $200,000 at the end of the
day it didn't even matter that that
message was more popular it's the fact
that it wasn't able to get out to the
people because the media wouldn't cover
exactly it drowns you out it drowns out
the message which is overwhelmingly
popular so there needs to be a way to
work around what they're doing and the
only real solution is small donors but
they need to hear about it so how can
let's talk about some of some of the
other issues that your campaign that
you're campaigning on so
medicare-for-all obviously is the big
one what other issues are important to
you we're really strong on education as
well making sure that our
schools you know keep public money into
public you know schools that were not
going and giving voucher system and that
were actually need to devote more into
our school system I'm also running on
you know livable wage Federal jobs
guarantee that's really moving us
towards Grant green energy that's
something we need desperately moved
towards something I tell people a lot is
that with my candidacy I bring a really
unique mix to Congress and that I have
been that single mother on Medicare and
and on food stamps and on WIC homeless
with my kids and then I worked right
through college and I became a CFO and I
understand precisely what is going on in
our economy and how we're really
everything is very intersectional and we
cannot talk about the issues you know
one issue alone without talking about
the other issues even with health care
even if everyone had health care if you
don't have employee protections in place
or you don't make enough you're not
gonna have the same level of health care
as someone who can afford to take off
from work or well doesn't risk being
fired for taking off work we're also
really big on the LGBTQ issues making
sure that we have equality and we have a
pretty strong foreign policy platform as
well and my husband is in the military
and I really have watched and seeing
what he's gone through and what's
happening and really admire people like
Tulsi on their stand on foreign policy
and making sure that we are going after
diplomacy before we declare acts of war
so you want to port the troops by not
sending them into harm's way needlessly
and ending the dumb Wars right exactly
and that's been something I think it
needs to come for more people who have
ties to the military because the first
thing people will say well you know you
don't have a right to speak well yeah I
do
and so this Tulsi and every and the
other people that are speaking up that I
have ties and have served or have family
members serving what I'm seeing now is
very disheartening sure so I was gonna
say Medicare for all are you for free
college
yes college living wage you hinted there
are you at some sort of like a new New
Deal program oh yeah a big okay big jobs
program New Deal
a green new New Deal right exactly
ending the wars so this is all you know
again when you go issue for issue these
are these issues pull through the roof
like in fact it's astonishing and that
even many Republicans like grassroots
Republicans average Joe Republicans if
you talk to them now it's more it's a
plurality of Republicans that actually
support Medicare for all there's more
Republicans that support Medicare for
all than don't which is really a
fascinating thing when you think about
it and basically what that tells me
Amy is that the populism wins you know
populism is a is a winning issue in that
it's bipartisan so you can get people on
the right and people on the Left to
support you as long as you're fighting
for the people well that goes to what I
believe I don't believe that
Trump won because everyone in the United
States is racist or ignorant I think he
won because he was running on a populist
platform and although he meant none of
it he was out there saying you know I'm
against really bad trade agreements I am
making to make sure you have a job I'm
gonna make sure you have health care
everyone's gonna have health care you
know these are the things that he was
running on he wasn't saying it was just
pie in the sky he was saying I'm gonna
do this I'm not your typical politician
that's what this is like really gets to
me is I don't understand how a vast
majority of the democratic party right
now does not see this for what it is and
say we need to make change and then we
have Pelosi going on saying well you
know no I don't think anyone once
changed I'm not there talking to people
every day we've knocked on over fifty
thousand doors and phone calls made
between doors and phone calls we've been
out there in the community both Democrat
and Republican and this actually
transcends over party lines you know
it's the it's the corporate Democratic
strategy to shame Trump voters and to
shame people on the Left who won't vote
for them because they're not appealing
to them with policies so when you
have something to actually offer people
to say here's why you should come vote
for me then it's a lot easier to just
shame people and say hey you know what
you're you just voted for that guy cuz
you're racist and you don't want to vote
for me because you're dumb
so they whereas you come along and
you're offering people a vision you're
offering people a social democratic
philosophy that they can get behind so
you don't need to shame Trump voters in
the process you know that's that that's
exactly like you said for people like
Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer so tell
everybody where they can donate to you
because again you're not taking any
corporate PAC money and you're you're
raising money grassroots style so almost
just by virtue of that fact staying pure
you're at a disadvantage and everybody
needs to know that you know a lot of
people sit there and listen to what
you're saying and they'll go oh I really
like Amy of well I hope she wins but
they don't understand that they have the
the power to help you if they just
donate $5 or $10 or go the Bernie route
and donate $27 and the only way that
we're gonna win these races is if we can
keep up to try to get our message out
because we're at a permanent
disadvantage because the opponents are
taking corporate PAC money in there they
have so much more money again Joe
Manchin six million dollars apology and
Swearengen 185 thousand dollars you want
to see the difference in that race there
it is right there so tell everybody
where they can donate to your campaign
definitely and I want to add to what
you're saying is that that's something
we're running into a lot is progressives
are like well you don't need as much
money and you don't need to when we
don't need as much money but we do need
money in order to print materials signs
I mean so we can get the word out there
and amplified most of us cannot afford
to do TV ads so we need to have twice as
much going out into the field and
there's money give twice as much out
there in signage and that all costs
money and this is a very viable campaign
we are so close to getting a progressive
Democrat in the state of Nevada and
that's so important not just for 2018
but 2020 we have any hopes of getting a
true progressive or
someone who is very left in as president
we have to have this seat it's so
important so please come to my site it's
a me for the people calm and you know
definitely you know please donate if you
can volunteer you want dude phone
banking in the United State you can do
that as well as a volunteer section and
of course like and share the
progressives are you amplify our message
you know if you see a progressive you
like go in there and start sharing
sharing their information well less than
30 days out and there are some really
strong campaigns out there like mine
that are they are viable and they can
win so we are one of the forerunners in
this race what date is is is your
election what date is it our election is
June 12th early voting begins this month
on the 26th and we're doing a really
hard push right now to make sure that we
have enough with printed materials and
enough money to do a really strong
so today is the day that Israel is
opening up or the u.s. is opening up its
new embassy in Jerusalem and of course
that's a massively massively
controversial move because it's nothing
but a giant middle finger to
Palestinians and it lets them know hey
we're really done with the whole idea of
trying to make peace because one of the
things that you often hear is this shows
that Jerusalem is the undivided capital
of Israel that's what they say now the
context that's missing there that a lot
of people definitely people in
mainstream media don't tell you is that
under any peace deal that would be a
two-state peace deal two-state solution
as people talk about you would have
Jerusalem be the you split Jerusalem so
Palestinians yet half Israelis get half
and that's the capital of a future
Palestinian state under every conception
of a two-state solution that I've ever
seen that's a given
it's a given that that will be the
capital of the future Palestinian state
so by bringing the US embassy there by
talking about how there's this proves
Jerusalem is the undivided capital of
Israel these are all I would say dog
whistles but it's not dog whistles it's
a [ __ ] foghorn that says we're not
gonna make peace with you we don't want
to make peace with you we're done with
the two-state solution it's not actually
gonna happen
and it's really a way of just verifying
everything that has been said every step
of the way by Palestinians that hey
listen it's not us it's it's the
Israelis they have all the power in the
situation that's obvious to see and if
they really wanted to make peace they
could make peace and it's not hard to do
so when you have a very powerful
military you have the backing of the
most powerful military that's ever
existed in human history yeah if you
want to make
peace you can make peace and there's
been repeated attempts on the
Palestinian side to do exactly that
I mean they've gone to the UN and every
time they go to the UN they've proposed
a you know a peace deal a two-state deal
through Jordan at the UN and Israel
rejects it and says no you have to come
to negotiate with us directly then they
go negotiate with them directly and
Israel says no we will reject all of
your you know all of your claims we
disagree with and we think you're way
out of bounds here and what you propose
to be the borders and and then of course
you have some times Hamas does violence
in order to try to achieve their goals
and then go how dare you use violence
now you must use you must try to use
peace and then they go back to the UN
and they try to get peace through the UN
and they go how dare you go to the UN
now you got to come talk to us
face-to-face and then they come talk
face-to-face and do direct negotiations
and Israel goes no we reject all of your
claims that you say so no it's a circle
round and round around around around no
matter what they propose you reject it
you get outraged by it when they resort
to violence
they you know they clutch their pearls
and go oh who could have seen this
coming how immoral of you to do violence
well if if violence is unacceptable and
I agree it should be unacceptable well
then you have to do some sort of
diplomatic peace deal and negotiation
whether it be through the UN are face to
face but then if you reject everything
through the UN or face to face then stop
pretending that like you're in favor of
peace just admit it just say it out loud
we want to permanently occupy you we're
not interested in the two-state deal and
this is all just a game because that's
what it is it's a game they're trying to
pull the wool over everybody's eyes as
they do a slow-moving ethnic cleansing
you know and it has to do with basically
giving all the land to Israel and if the
two-state solution is dead then what's
the only other option the only other
option is a one state deal with equal
rights for Palestinians and that's of
course not being discussed and of course
Gaza is an open-air prison for example
and they keep expanding further and
further in the West Bank and taking more
territory and now with this Jerusalem
move it's just the biggest sign in the
world I mean there's already been a
zillion signs how many times
you need a new illegal settlement being
built before people got the idea that
Netanyahu is not a partner in peace he
said repeatedly you know sometimes when
campaigning he said yeah there's never
gonna be a Palestinian state so but this
is the nail in the coffin of the
delusion of the two-state deal and this
naturally this led to Palestinian saying
okay well all of our options are gone
they're off the table so we're gonna do
protests massive protests nonviolent
protests so they go to the Israeli
border to protest this opening of the US
Embassy in Jerusalem and guess the
response of the Israeli government
Amnesty International says we are
witnessing an abhorrent violation of
international law and human rights in
Gaza thirty-eight confirmed dead
including six children with close to
2,000 people injured many are reporting
injuries to the head and chest
so snipers here over 500 injured with
live ammunition this must end
immediately 41 people now killed in Gaza
so the number keeps ticking up this is
breaking news as I'm talking to you guys
now and almost 2,000 injured over 900
with live ammunition a shameless
violation of international law in some
instances constituting war crimes the
Israeli authorities show no signs they
intend to rein in excessive force arms
embargo needed and then you also see
Israeli soldiers have used weapons some
made in the US and designed to cause
maximum harm against individuals who
were not posing an imminent threat to
them injuring thousands and killing 37
that so this tweet was from a little
earlier now it's 41 like I said
including some in what appeared to have
been willful killings so in other words
the same thing is happening now as
happened recently where we caught on
tape Israeli snipers executing
journalists there were instances of
people running away from the border and
being taken out by Israeli snipers all
on video all on video
it's like they've gotten to the point
where they know there's gonna be no real
punishment there's not even going to be
a slap on the wrist so they just yeah
whatever we executed some Palestinians
we executed some journalists some people
literally had press written on their
chest some people running away from the
border we killed him and there's nothing
anybody's gonna do about it
the Internet's gonna be outraged because
we saw it on video but you know hey what
are gonna do they've been killing people
who are engaged in prayer by the border
yeah real violent threat when they're
engaged in prayer on the border we've
seen the video of that and now you have
peaceful protests as a direct result of
the opening of the US Embassy in
Jerusalem and this it's a massacre
that's what this is it's a massacre
that's exactly what's happening when you
look at unarmed protesters and they're
gunning them down 41 dead as of right
now that number is definitely gonna rise
nearly 2,000 injured including killing
children and the top human rights
organizations in the world are saying
hey by the way this is it this appears
to be willful targeting of innocent
people well then what you have is a
massacre that's what you have and it's
really gross to see the reaction of like
Donald Trump is tweeting out a big day
for Israel congratulations and there's
this joyous mood over the move of the
embassy and you have Lindsey Graham same
thing it tweeting about how this is a
wonderful day and wonderful things are
happening and they're totally insulated
from the reality of the situation on the
ground with Palestinians being murdered
protesting for their human rights
because those guys don't get the
Republican politicians they don't give a
[ __ ] they don't care at all and I'm not
saying the Democratic politicians do
care cuz I haven't seen many outrage
tweets from Democratic politicians or
anything like that but it's it shows
that there's a level of D human
nation that occurred and they don't view
the death of Palestinians as some sort
of tragedy and they don't view the IDF
as acting in an aggressive way they view
it as in the same way they view our
violence hey no matter what happens by
definition we're the good guys by
definition in Israel Israel is good so
when the IDF massacres unarmed people
who are just protesting for human rights
we're not even gonna acknowledge it
we're not even gonna discuss it and the
media is no better in the u.s. there's
been a thousand headlines where and a
lot of people have been pointing this
out and it's brilliant that they caught
on to this they frame it in a passive
way so they don't assign agency to the
IDF when they kill innocent Palestinians
they say stuff like you know over a
dozen Palestinians killed in clashes at
the border now when you frame it like
that what's your to take away the take
away you don't know exactly what
happened hey did the Palestinians start
the violence and then there was a
response from the IDF was it just you
know in unnecessary or was it just a
freak occurrence that led to one being
that two people being killed they don't
say it call it like it is because again
we're allied with the Israeli government
so our propaganda works to prop up
everything that they do so they never
say you know IDF massacres unarmed
protesters in in criminal incident but
committing war crimes they never they
never framed it like that because again
by definition the the IDF is viewed as
acting in self-defense even when it's
beyond obvious that that's not the case
so here's my question to people who
would defend the IDF and the actions of
the Israeli government in the situation
what can Palestinians do that's my
question for you what are they supposed
to do so are you for peaceful
negotiations at a two-state deal along
the 67 borders because they reject that
even Hamas at this point has come out
said we'll accept a 1967 borders in a
two-state deal again that's something
you don't hear in in US media but that's
true so what are you for if you're
defending the idea what do you want the
Palestinians to do cuz the number one
thing they'll say is okay I guess it's
okay if they do peaceful protests to try
to get some sort of deal and some sort
of amelioration of the terrible living
circumstance that they're in cuz Gaza
for example is an open-air prison as
it's been referred to well now they're
doing the peaceful protests and Israel
is massacring them they're massacring
them 41 dead right now again that number
is gonna rise nearly 2,000 injured so
what do you want them to do
now they're doing the peaceful protests
and you're saying hey maybe they had it
coming when they get gunned down by the
IDF again it's not me saying it it's the
top human rights groups in the world
saying in some instances you have war
crimes where they're just killing people
who present obviously no threat to them
so again the same is when they massacred
the journalists recently so I don't know
it's amazing to me that US media and the
US establishment can still basically try
to pretend like you know Palestinians
are perpetrators and not victims but
that's what they do that's really what
they do they act like well I don't know
what's his response to do it but poor
Israel what are they supposed to do I
mean obviously when you see peaceful
protesters at your border you gunned
down at least 41 at least 41 of them and
injure thousands of them so I don't how
can the propaganda be that strong where
they they're trying to it's a situation
of a clear situation of who you gonna
believe me or your lying eyes that's
what they're saying to you and listen
this gets even more and more bizarre too
because take a look at this tweet so
this is from right-wing watch they say
Robert Jeffers invited by Trump to pray
at the opening of the new embassy in
Jerusalem says God opposes a land for
peace two-state solution to
israel-palestinian conflict now okay
that's an it's not just Robert Jeffers I
want I want to be perfectly clear on
this it's also the overwhelming majority
of la cude the la cude party which is
Netanyahu's party right-wing party in
Israel and also the Jewish home party
which is the further right-wing party so
make no mistake about it the official
stated position of everybody that's
celebrating this deal on the Israeli
side is no this is this is great number
one number two yeah we're not in favor
of a peace deal a two-state deal we're
not favor of an palestinian state so
there's so much double speak on this
issue where again Israel always feigns
and pretends like oh we just all we want
is peace it's these people on the other
side that are just they're unreasonable
but then again anytime they they
approach them with a peace deal they go
no we reject that out of hand so just
admit it admit you're not in favor of a
Palestinian state ever and you want to
take all the land in due time just admit
it just say it just say it just say it
just say it because one of the top guys
who's you know celebrating this with you
who Trump picked is like yeah [ __ ] peace
I don't want peace I don't want a
two-state deal I don't a Palestinian
state but it gets even worse than that
look at who else is there
so this isn't not a guy you hear a lot
about nowadays we've covered him in the
past he's an absolute lunatic
anti-semitic Pastor John Hagee who has
said that Hitler fulfilled God's will
will deliver the benediction at the US
Embassy opening in Jerusalem so
understand guys this is a move on
Trump's part that is 100% for religious
fanatics radical fundamentalists of the
Christian variety end of the Jewish
variety ultra-orthodox extremists and
Christian fundamentalist extremists now
the Jewish fundamentalists think no we
have a right to all of this land we have
a right to a Paul
of this land so Palestinians begone we
don't care about your human rights who
gives a [ __ ] and the Christian
fundamentalists like John Hagee and
Robert Jeffers well why are they aligned
with the fundamentalist Jewish people
well the answer is the rapture all of
the land is supposed to be Israel's so
that God so that Jesus can return and
when Jesus returns he massacres most of
the Jews but Robert Jeffers and John
Hagee they have this unholy and strange
alliance with the far right in Israel
because they know that all that land is
supposed to be Israel's in order to
fulfill Biblical prophecy so one of the
most hilarious things you often hear is
well you know the problem is the
Palestinians because they're all you
know super religious and fundamentalist
Muslims and that's why you can't make
peace because they're they're so
irrational they view everything through
a religious lens well listen for some
Palestinian sure there are Muslim
fundamentalists who view this conflict
or religious lens no doubt about it but
there are also a far-right religious
fundamentalists in Israel and far-right
Christian fundamentalist in the u.s.
that also view this through a religious
lens and that is exactly who Trump is
appeasing with this move with the
embassy move that's one hundred percent
who this is for his base his
fundamentalist Christian base in the US
and again like I said at the same time
this makes people like Netanyahu and la
cude in the Jewish home party and
ultra-orthodox fundamentalist Jews love
Donald Trump's move as well so it this
is what this is the hill we want to die
on and what happened to the America
first people you know the America first
people are you guys gonna be against
this move which is obviously Israel
first and not just Israel the far right
of Israel this is
unnecessarily gonna create so much more
conflict in fact every other president
in the modern era before Trump was like
yeah I'm not gonna allow the u.s. to
move our embassy to Jerusalem because
that obviously creates so many more
problems than it solves
and that's gonna be a giant headache
there's gonna be fighting that breaks
out as a result of it there's gonna be a
lot of blood spilled
but Trump doesn't give a [ __ ] he doesn't
care so as long as he's appeasing his
Christian fundamentalist base in the US
and now the far right in Israel
absolutely loves him they they're in
their own little bubble and they simply
do not care about the suffering of
innocent Palestinians so just call it
what it is there's a massacre going on
right now the Israeli government is
killing peaceful Palestinians and our
government doesn't care the Israeli
government doesn't care and the media is
covering it in the saddest most
ridiculous both sides do it way
imaginable it's false equivalency
through and through so it's not a good
day it's not a good day today and my
heart goes out to the Palestinians who
are suffering and struggling and doing
everything they can to try to get their
human rights and they're getting their I
spit in by illegal occupiers and by the
the world's sole superpower that backs
that country come hell or high water no
matter what they do and no matter how
many wrongs they commit
so Ben Shapiro and Alex Jones have been
sniping at each other on social media
and it's awesome I've been having a hard
time determining who I dislike more it's
it's a tough one you got to sit down and
think about it and I'm still not sure I
have a conclusion on that as to who I
dislike more but I do think I know who
you know got the better in this exchange
I think that's pretty straightforward
so let me explain the backstory and then
I have to show you the clip of Alex
Jones melting down on air over this so
Alex tweeted the following Ben Shapiro
crawls out from under his thought police
Rock to tell real Candice Owens and
Kanye West they shouldn't come on my
show shocking authoritarianism maybe
they should make Ben the head of the
Democratic Party
so what ben shapiro tweeted was
apparently kanye west or alex jones or
something like that tweeted Oh Kanye is
gonna be on my show like Alex Jones
tweeted that and ben shapiro tweeted
like no kanye no no and i find that
funny for a variety of reasons but most
importantly is like well why do you care
where kanye goes it's not like he's
doing well without going on Alex Jones
Show you know what I mean like he's he's
already been really erratic and saying
preposterous things the politics aside
even if you take away every political
tweet he ever made he's saying erratic
like stupid [ __ ]
so for Ben to be like no don't go on
aand Alex Jones Show it's like why what
rep he's not trying to save a reputation
or anything he's already been saying
stupid [ __ ] he'd just be saying stupid
[ __ ] alongside Alex Jones so it's like
who cares it's almost like bench piers
like no you just recently turned
conservative don't go conservative and
conspiratorial conservative stay
conservative and like mainline
conservative like me ben shapiro at
least that's the sense i get from what
ben shapiro was saying when he said no
no
like what's implied in that he's saying
no because it's like Kanye you were
doing so well but now you're turning
conspiratorial yeah Kanye is doing
really well without going on Alex Jones
Show it's like what
so Shapiro responds to Alex Jones dude
they shouldn't come on your show because
you are awful
have I been unclear about this in any
way then Alex Jones tries to take a page
at a trumps playbook you know how Trump
assigns people like nicknames and stuff
Alex Jones response to Shapiro since
hash tag tiny ben shapiro thinks he can
control who can come on my show as
guests and who can't I challenge him to
debate me on one of his platforms or on
mine he can name the place date and time
and if he doesn't he's a neocon coward
just like Glenn Beck
so then Shapiro responds by saying no
I'm not gonna debate you and here's just
a few of the reasons why and Shapiro
tweets links that show us how Alex Jones
pushed pizza gate and Alex Jones pushed
how Sandy Hook is a hoax and he you know
9/11 was an inside job and all this
stuff so basically this is Shapiro
saying listen man you have less than no
credibility so [ __ ] right off I have no
interest in wasting my time with you and
then Jones in again in trumpian fashion
responds and says oh look Ben Shapiro is
now tweeting out fake news clippings
from mainstream media to defend his call
for me to be banned from the internet
what you truly are following in the
steps of Glenn Beck then Shapiro
responds on the contrary I want you to
remain on the Internet
so we can all see your crazy firsthand
so listen I don't
again I despise both these guys but when
Jones says oh you're tweeting out fake
news clippings from the mainstream media
Alex you believed Sandy Hook was a hoax
I've played a clip back to back to back
to back to back and I only played like a
third of it but it's countless examples
of you saying yeah Sandy Hook is a hook
is a hoax Shapiro also tweeted out one
of the quotes of
Alex Jones saying about how the
chemicals in the water turning the Frog
gay and [ __ ] it's like dude stop trying
to be a weasel and get your way out of
it like on the fact that you said that
[ __ ] Alex Jones has a lot of just wacky
wild [ __ ] and then when people like
quote him or push back on it he's like
no you're misstating what I said no he's
not [ __ ] misstating it I despised ben
shapiro and often times he does miss
state [ __ ] all the [ __ ] time you miss
state [ __ ] but when you when he tweets
something that says you're a [ __ ]
sandy hook truther that's a goddamn fact
now since there's been threats of a
lawsuit if not an actual lawsuit he now
has softly backpedaled from that but
there were countless quotes of him
saying effectively Sandy Hook is a hoax
so I don't I hate to like Shapiro points
out things that Alex Jones believes and
he's accurate about that or thinks he
said and he's being accurate about that
and then Jones is like your fake news
it's not fake news it's not fake news
it's not fake news it's not fake news
it's not fake news and then he just
makes up like Shapiro wants me banned
from the internet he didn't [ __ ] say
that you just said it he didn't say that
so it's it Jones is even more erratic
than Kanye like Kanye says erratic [ __ ]
but Jones is like I'm gonna one-up that
I'm gonna 3-up that where's the cocaine
what oh did I say that out loud sorry I
retract my previous statement do I
really I don't know um so after all that
back and forth Alex Jones is [ __ ]
seething and anger because keep it real
Ben Shapiro got the best of him in that
exchange
I think that's cleared clear to see so
Alex goes on his show and just
absolutely loses it and goes super
unhinged watch Ben Shapiro the unmade
man
none of these so-called fake
conservatives can ever launch a company
they've always got billionaires
financing them which isn't a bad thing
but we're the only outfit self-made no
one else in media except Matt drudges
self-made no one Matt Drudge and in
fours at this level no one else Matt
Drudge and in fours that's it now think
about that
they say Ben Shapiro is buying the place
no Texas billionaires that he's
carpetbag down here to get are trying to
do it I think I'm gonna call those
billionaires and warn those guys I know
years ago I thought love people contact
me and I ever got back as I'm a I'm on
funding my own operation here that's my
mission
but if Shapiro really wants to get in my
business down here in Texas try to move
down here we already exposed back as a
fake he's out of business he's pretty
much closed shop he's gonna reach
Imperials website almost every comment
can't stand him and hates him
cuz it's this whole act of Howie's
intellectual and he's this genius and
he's this wizard and he knows everything
and then almost every comment I'm gonna
show you later hate his guts
and say oh you're so intellectual you
use terms like alex is awful
and of course won't debate me and why am
i mad because Glenn Beck got in my
business with radio stations and would
keep me off here I talked to many
station owners and managers where they
were threatened to not be on their
station and do all the stuff of if I
wasn't taking off and now you're in my
business again trying to tell people on
call my show I'm about to get your
business big-time you little arrogant
son of a [ __ ] now go back to California
go back to Los Angeles where you came
from wait till I go talk to those
billionaires they're good Christian men
seventh-day Adventist pastors and lay
out how you and Jordan Peter so you
think I'm stupid cuz I'm from Texas wait
till I go explain to those self-made men
that you aren't as a self-made Texan
myself how you and others in the Atheist
movement are taking control of the whole
conservative movement and that's why the
left puts Peterson and all you guys on
TV and doesn't censor you with a whole
atheist bent and the whole know Christ
isn't God thing all of that how did you
convince Texas Christians
sit there and prop up blend back in now
you you don't think I don't know
everything about you bro
and now you're trying to sucker them to
buy the failed garbage blaze you can't
make anything you parasite get behind me
Satan we should pray for Ben Shapiro to
find Christ is this whole act of how
smart he is is he just sits there greens
off and teleprompter and plagiarizes
people in my view so you're in my
business Shapiro I'm in your business
now I might just go drive up the Cisco
this weekend take a few army officers
with me have a conversation with with
the billionaire's that are financing you
maybe show them some files Shapiro what
that think you do I think I'll do it I
think I'll get in your business you know
what happens when I get in people's
businesses boy they ain't in business
long son it's it's not hard to go after
these people because they're already
can't help but sabotage the Christian
libertarian movement they're Judas
Coates their operatives and that's what
they do they try to act like they're
credible get control the movement and
then steer it into the ground and they
try to make sure the big funds out there
go into what they're doing and then they
bring on Jordan Peterson who I've been
looking at studying out of nowhere
doesn't believe in God but he'll tell
you how to wake up and suddenly the
Atlantic of New York Times like seamen
he doesn't get censored and they're all
together and they're gonna have a show
and they're gonna come and merge with
Glenn Beck and how Christian is that to
have Horton Peterson the atheist that
the Liberals love that Bill Maher loves
who explains to us that they're only two
genders and we all go oh they let him on
here say that this is so original
he gives us some Karl Yune passages
which is fine he's a witty guy I think
does some good but look at this is gonna
be the conservative movement this is the
new leaders of it number Christians
Wow
Wow I think he said a little too much
there listen man Alex Jones is getting
more and more unhinged as time goes by
and sometimes in his rants he like drops
hints about what he really believes and
that was that's ugly
that was ugly so first of all he said he
says we're the only media outlet that's
self-made that's nowhere near true not
even close to true
we're self-made Jimmy Dore is self-made
humanists report there are a lot of
people who are self-made we most of our
funding comes from you guys on patreon
two bucks at a time and if people want
to go nuts seven bucks there's the
option to two dollars five dollars or
seven dollars if you like this content
by the way patreon.com slash secular
talk good time to plug it that's where
most of our funding comes from and he
loves to do these things like blow
himself and act like he's special and
I'm the only one telling the truth and
Omni were the only only self-made outlet
only self-made outlet that's not even
close to true man
why do you say [ __ ] like that so he says
that and then he says to Shapiro I'm
gonna basically go threaten your funders
I'm gonna tell your billionaire funders
who you really are and then they'll cut
off your funding listen man I do I agree
with Ben Shapiro and his business model
no I'm sure he has big money backers
most of the people in media have big
money backers but should Alex Jones go
threaten Ben Shapiro's funders because
he has a personal disagreement with him
come on man and then Alec says screams
like get out of my business you just
said you're gonna threaten his funders
and you're screaming for him to go to
your business but he's not in your
business he's oh you're saying Oh cuz
he's told Connie not to go on whatever
man free country you can say whatever
the [ __ ] he wants
you could say whatever the [ __ ] he wants
and again it's not like I don't care if
Kanye goes on your show or not in fact I
actually probably wanted to come on your
show because it'd be hilarious to watch
that
so I disagree with ben shapiro on that
but he could say whatever the [ __ ] he
wants and by the way that's not gonna
have an effect it's not like kanye west
is sitting there and he's like he sees
ben shapiro tweeted him he was like i
will now make career decisions based on
ben shapiro it's like he's not gonna
[ __ ] do that so he's just totally
unhinged but then okay the parts were I
start cringing and and actually going
like whoa man he called Ben Shapiro a
parasite and then said get behind me
Satan and then said he needs to find
Christ listen that's that's all
anti-semitism 101
it really is get behind me Satan because
he's Jewish
he's a parasite again another one of the
old stereotypes about Jewish people he's
not a self-made man these guys can't
make it on their own they have to leech
off other people and we need him and he
just said it we need him to find Christ
the [ __ ] does that have to do with
anything I never I honestly didn't know
that Alex Jones had this in him like the
the genuine like he keeps freeing up the
fact that he's a Christian and then he
says you know all the atheist movements
moving away from Christianity none of
these guys who are now leaders or
Christians the [ __ ] does that do with
anything
you don't even talk about your
Christianity probably because it's
indefensible nobody can actually make
arguments nowadays for believing in a
zombie Jewish carpenter who walked on
water and whose three people but he's
one person like us we're past that man
is not 1956 any more [ __ ] Pat
Robertson can't waltz out there and make
up some [ __ ] voodoo and then
everybody believes it now we have
science and we have the Internet and
people just don't are moving away from
religion at the moment but he keeps
bringing up religion why are you keep
bringing it why do you keep bringing up
religion Shapira said nothing about
religion but he brings it up because yes
on some level he's really bothered by
the fact that Shapiro is Jewish and
that's the other thing is he brings up
he says a bench Bureau and Petersen are
part of the atheist movement
then Shapiro's Jewish and not like you
know Jewish atheists like there's some
people who describe themselves as like
oh I'm culturally Jewish but I'm an
atheist no he's Jewish Jewish Ben
Shapiro is Jewish and peterson is
christian he is christian and he does
believe in God and Peterson actually
talks about that [ __ ] so he's wrong to
say that none of these guys are
Christian number one but number two why
are you even bringing that up why are
you bringing up religion but number
three the Atheist movement does not love
these guys the atheist movement
generally does not like ben shapiro the
atheist movement i mean i guess some of
them like peterson but they all
recognize that he's christian and then
he says oh and liberals like these guys
what the [ __ ] are you talking about
liberals despise ben shapiro I'm on the
left
I despise ben shapiro i and that's see
that's the main point here is here we
have a feud between ben shapiro and alex
jones and it's not even close like I
probably despise them both equally but
ben shapiro obviously got the better of
alex jones in this exchange and alex
jones comes across looking really petty
and really insecure and really unhinged
and man he really should get some help
like a lot of the it's really I don't
even I feel kind of bad even doing the
segment for highlighting like how
unhinged this guy is but if you want to
do it if you want to feud with ben
shapiro alex let me give you a little
advice your buddy the first thing you
should be talking about is the fact that
ben shapiro
was unrepentant in pushing for the iraq
war how minimum 200,000 civilians died
in iraq thousands of our soldiers died
we did an offensive war against a
country that didn't attack us and did
torture to cover it up and then promoted
the torturers and ben shapiro all along
the way mocked and degraded and
disrespected the anti-war people who
were right factually right about
everything shapiro went right along with
the propaganda of saddam hussein weapons
of mass destruction and Osama bin Laden
and al Qaeda maybe maybe so here you
have a guy and that's the point about
ben shapiro genuinely odious in his
beliefs
was for the Iraq war you should go go
back and read his old writings on gay
marriage I mean that [ __ ] is literally
like Pat Robertson or John Hagee wrote
it talking about the gay agenda is
coming to take over shut the [ __ ] up
with that drivel so listen if you wanted
a feud with ben shapiro alex there were
a lot of things you could have held over
his head his Iraq war support his you
know strong stance against gay marriage
and a plethora of other things but no
you went to attack him personally and
threatened his funders and you keep
weirdly bringing up religion and
dropping anti-semitic hints it's ugly
and yeah it's gross but anyway if you
can't tell even though I the funny thing
is on actual policy to the extent we can
ascertain what Alex Jones actually
believes on policy I actually agree a
little more with Jones because he's he
says he's libertarian he's not
libertarian he's libertarian ish and
sometimes he talks about you know NSA
spying and he talks about civil
liberties being violated and he talks
about ending a war so on actual policy
stuff
I agree more with Alex Jones again to
the extent he actually believes any of
that [ __ ] really but I'm inclined to
defend Shapiro in this segment because
you're not talking about policy should
at all you're attacking you know him
personally and threatening his funders
and just saying anti-semitic [ __ ] and
it's like the entire time you're like
acting as if he's attacking you when he
just said you're a goofball and here's
[ __ ] you're obviously wrong about like
your conspiracy nonsense but instead of
firing back and saying well you push the
Iraq war and you know you were massively
against gay marriage and you know I'm
sure Ben Shapiro was cheerleading NSA
spying in the Patriot Act instead of
saying hey you were so wrong about all
this weren't you you took an ugly road
so even though I probably agree more
with Alex Jones on policy Shapiro got
the better of this exchange and it got
ugly man it was fun there for a while
but then I started cringing
President Trump has officially pulled
out of the Iran deal that's not good
that's not good I'll break it all down
in a little bit but first let's see what
he said about it and then I'll do my
best to deconstruct it for you and give
you all the nuance and tell you all the
implications we'll see how we do with
Iran probably we won't do very well with
them but that's okay too they've got to
understand life because I don't think
they do understand life if you look at
what's happening in the Middle East with
Syria with Yemen with all other places
they're involved it's bedlam and death
and we can't allow that to happen so we
have terminated a terrible terrible deal
that should have never ever been made
and we will be putting on among the
strongest sanctions that we've ever put
on a country and they're going into
effect very shortly
they're mostly constituted and drawn
already and we'll just have to see what
happens but we can't allow a deal to
hurt the world that's a deal to hurt the
world that's not a deal for the United
States that's a deal to hurt the world
and so we're going to make either a
really good deal for the world or we're
not going to make a deal at all
and Iran will come back say we don't
want to negotiate and of course they're
going to say that and if I wear their
physician I'd say that - for the first
couple of months we're not going to
negotiate but they'll negotiate or
something will happen and hopefully that
won't be the case but I don't think they
should do that I would advise Iran not
to start their nuclear program I would
advise them very strongly if they do
there will be very severe consequence
okay thank you very much okay so there's
a lot to say about this first of all
let's talk a little bit about what the
Iran deal actually is so under the Iran
deal the IAEA the International Atomic
Energy Agency
they get to basically go into Iran and
regulate the [ __ ] out of their nuclear
program
so under this deal Iran is allowed to
have a nuclear program as every country
is under internet international law but
they're only allowed to enrich to a very
low point not the point where you can
get a nuclear weapon they would need to
it would require a significant amount
more enrichment in order to get to a
nuclear weapon so they can do it for
power for their power grid and research
so they're allowed to have a nuclear
program for those reasons again as every
country is under international law
that's just a restatement of
international law so in effect we really
eat there are some hardliners in the US
who say they should have no nuclear
power at all but that's actually that's
not even up for debate or question under
international law they are allowed to
have it for medical research and for
power for their power grid and things of
that nature so they're allowed to have
that and again they're regulated heavily
by the IAEA who can go in there whenever
they want and check and see what's going
on and to this point ten times the IAEA
since the deal was signed 10 times the
IAEA said they're abiding by the deal
completely so in other words the experts
who are responsible for upholding the
deal have said they're upholding their
end of the deal across the board that's
an important fact in fact that's never
brought up by US media honestly never
even brought up by the Democrats now in
return for basically the guarantee that
they don't create a nuclear weapon and
allowing in the regulators to check to
make sure all that happens is the u.s.
relieved the sanctions that we had on
them for a very long time and we give
them back their own money that we stole
and so we have to promise not to put any
new sanctions on them under the deal and
give them back their own money that we
stole
in order to understand why we even had
this deal in the first place you have to
understand history going back decades
and a lot of people don't know this but
in 1953 the CIA overthrew the
democratically elected leader of Iran a
guy named Mohammad Mossadegh now the
reason why we overthrew him is and this
is all historical record you could check
it for yourself it's all out there in
the open this isn't even stuff that they
pretend isn't true anymore it's gotten
to the point where they're like yeah
that's what it is so Mohammad Mossadegh
was elected and he promised that he was
going to give the oil wealth of the
country of Iran to the people of Iran so
when he got in power the u.s. said nope
we can't allow that to happen there's
actually to be fair the US and the UK so
the CIA overthrew the Iranian government
and put the Shah into power
now the Shah had a dictatorship and in
some he was more secular in some ways
and so on social issues you could say
okay he did a better job than what they
have now but inevitably what ended up
happening was the Shah was overthrown in
the 1979 Islamic Revolution so the US
government overthrows a democratically
elected leader puts a dictator into
power then there's a backlash against
the US propped up in Western propped up
dictator and then there's the Islamic
Revolution so since the Islamic
Revolution they've had you know a
theocracy to one degree or another they
have elections and the president has
some power but of course the the
Revolutionary Guards and and the Grand
Ayatollah really really run stuff so
ever since that revolution we've
basically wanted regime change again in
Iran so with the Obama administration in
the Iran deal the nuclear deal it was
just kind of like an acceptance of
reality that okay these are the facts as
they exist right now they have a you
know a government that overthrew our
puppet dictatorship so we're just going
to work within the parameters and make
sure that they don't get a nuclear
weapon and then
give them back their own money and it's
just a way to create peace and stability
and Obama has there are a lot of
terrible things on Middle East policy
but I honestly think that was one of his
his best parts I gave him nothing but
credit for the Iran deal and in fact
what happened was there were some people
in the Trump administration who were
initially against the deal but then they
read it and for example when maddest
read it he said I read it three times
and I was shocked by how tough of a deal
it was and this is a talking point you
guys have heard me say a bunch of times
that under this deal the u.s. got
everything we wanted and all Iran got
was like the bare minimum you know hey
we're gonna roll back the sanctions that
we had on you we're gonna promise not to
add new sanctions and we're gonna give
you back your own money so that's like
okay you get the bare minimum and what
do we get the IAEA gets to basically go
in your country whenever you sacrifice
your sovereignty to have these
regulators go in there and they make
sure that you're not enriching to the
point of getting a nuclear weapon so the
only people who could be against this
deal are ignorant buffoons who know
nothing about it and you know for
example are swayed by stupid and
factually wrong Fox News talking points
and hardline neocon ideologues who want
regime change come hell or high water so
they're just gonna be against any deal
and you know my suspicion is john bolton
who of course was just brought in and
Mike Pompeo these are two people who
have been pushing Trump in the direction
of scrap the Iran nuclear deal and the
Trump I don't think he's a committed
ideologue I don't think he really
believes anything I just think he's
ignorant I think there's a I honestly
would laugh in your face if you told me
you genuinely believed that Donald Trump
read the Iran nuclear deal
I don't think you read it so he's just
going with what his top administration
officials are telling him and they
happen to be hardcore neo cons so that's
what that's the the background of the
Iran nuclear deal
you see a lot of hints of just how
ignorant Trump is in this clip he says
quote about Iran they've got to
understand life I have no idea what that
means that's something that somebody
says when they don't have anything
substantive to say so they fill the air
in the room by hearing their own voice
you know the Iranians they've got a
they've got to understand life I don't
think they understand life what does
that mean Don
and then he says it's a quote terrible
deal okay but you they never go on to
explain why or how it's a bad deal if
they ever say anything Trump brings up
they've got 150 billion dollars of our
money but that's just a lie that's just
factually wrong he makes it seem like
it's American taxpayer money that's
going to Iran that's not true we stole
their money from them and now we're
giving their money back to them so if
it's a terrible explain why it's a
terrible deal they will never give you
accurate real reasons why it's a
terrible deal and then he says we're
gonna make a really good deal okay but
then again so what would be in your
really good deal explain explain what
would be different from the deal we
already have explain what would
constitute a really good deal to what
ends to what ends and then he says oh
we're gonna put on the strongest
sanctions but jackass the whole point of
the sanctions in the first place was
okay we're gonna sanction you until we
get guarantees that you're not gonna
have a nuclear program to make weapons
and we can get regulators in there to
verify that so we got exactly the thing
that the sanctions were [ __ ] for we
got exactly what we wanted but that's
the thing that he doesn't [ __ ]
believe anything the neo-cons want
regime change and so what they're trying
to do is just break up peace and
diplomacy which is what we got with that
deal and then Trump is out there
feigning this idea like oh we're gonna
get a better deal we're gonna put
strongest sanctions on them to what ends
if you're gonna put the strongest
sanctions what for what what's the end
goal or do you just think the sanctions
on their own merit are just something
that's a positive which i think is
really the case on some level but
they're like yeah we just want to punish
we
punish the people of Iran because that's
what this is gonna do and then hopefully
the people of Iran will not blame the US
for and the sanctions for why they're
struggling and they will try to
overthrow the government I think that's
what's going on on some level you know
so discord in discontent and then make
it so that the people turn on the
Iranian government now they're you know
the people are already not happy with
the Iranian government but what's funny
is this this will do the exact opposite
of what they wanted to do this will make
people rally around their own government
and blame the United States and by the
way the other countries their five other
countries in the Iran deal are allies
all of them are like we're staying in
the deal so and that leads to another
point which is listen man the u.s. is
word our word was already worth [ __ ]
before in my opinion because we always
violate international law and I could
give you my whole spiel about that and
you've heard it a million times
but between the Paris agreement we're
the only country in the world that
backed out of the Paris agreement the
only one in the [ __ ] world and now
this no us treaty is gonna be worth
anything ever again because and people
aren't idiots they look and they go oh
they flip like that on things that they
sign the Nexen whatever the next
administration is that comes into power
after the one that signed the treaty
they can just [ __ ] get rid of it
immediately so if they're not gonna
uphold treaties well then why the [ __ ]
would anybody do any negotiation with
them at all and then that brings up the
other point of North Korea you just
decided hey we're gonna have talks with
North Korea and we're gonna get them to
give up their weapons he kim jeong-hoon
just saw you rip up a treaty where they
guaranteed we're not going to create
nuclear weapons and you wanted to punish
them anyway so why would that guy say
I'm gonna give up the nukes I already
have when it's a guarantee you're gonna
be standoffish no matter what it there
is no coherent philosophy guiding this
administration they're just a bunch of
[ __ ] rabid idiots that's what it is
and then he brings up Syria and Yemen
and
knowing that those countries exist
Donald that's probably the bare minimum
you know about them but the amazing
thing is if you're gonna bring up Iran
in the context of Syria and Yemen finish
the thought [ __ ] finish the thought
who are they fighting now when it comes
to Syria they're on the side of the
Assad government they're on the side of
the Syrian government
well the Syrian government like them or
hate them
they are fighting jihadists they are
fighting Isis and al-qaeda that's a fact
so oftentimes you hear this [ __ ]
talking point Trump has said it other
Republicans say it all the time even
some Democrats say it Iran is the number
one state sponsor of terrorism but they
include [ __ ] like that in their
conception of terrorism so being on the
side of the Syrian government against
Isis and al-qaeda constitutes terrorism
- these [ __ ] morons so and then with
Yemen are you [ __ ] kidding me the
Shia Houthis are in control of Yemen
right now they're fighting back against
Sunni fundamentalist so al-qaeda and
Saudi Arabia so yet again you're framing
this notion as and we don't even know
for sure if Iran is really giving
weapons to the Shia Houthis but let's
say they are for a second so what I
don't give a [ __ ]
I would rather then maintain control of
Yemen then [ __ ] al-qaeda who are the
Sunni militias on the ground so this
they're so confused about the world or
they're not really confused and what
they're they're doing is using these
arguments to bolster Saudi Arabia Saudi
Arabia who's our ally and we don't give
a [ __ ] that they're in bed with al-qaeda
we don't give a [ __ ] we fund jihadist
rebels in Syria so mister I'm tough on
terrorism is actually siding with the
people who are the real terrorists there
is no Shia jihadist threat against the
u.s. that's not a thing Jesus Christ man
and then
I think the the the most important point
is at the end of that clip there he says
we're gonna make a better deal which
again they never described what are the
terms of this better deal you're talking
about we already got everything we want
the Iran deal
we already got everything we want in
that so when you say we're gonna make
another deal first of all no you're not
second of all even if you were what the
[ __ ] would be in that deal what would be
in it that would make you different from
what we have right now he goes quote or
something will happen or what will
happen Don what will [ __ ] happen what
will happen say it say it say it
you guys want regime change again I
don't think he actually wants anything
because he's just an idiot he doesn't
know anything and he's ignorant he has
no ideology he's just [ __ ] going with
whatever the Windsor oh the last person
in the room told me to [ __ ] go to war
again so I'm going to Oregon but Pompeo
and bolton and the his rabid band of
neocon idiots that's what they want they
want regime change and they're gonna try
to get it come hell or high water and
listen listen men it's not a coincidence
that John Bolton came into the
administration and then a week later we
were already bombing the Syrian
government that's not a coincidence
these guys are open and honest about
what they want they want regime change
they want total and complete US
dominance of everywhere of everywhere in
the world that's what they want in the
geopolitical chess board we need to have
our puppet dictators in control so they
threw out a perfectly good deal simply
because they don't want that regime in
there so yet again it's hilarious these
are the same people who Yelp about
interference in our elections
interference in our elections we over
can you imagine having the nerve having
the balls where your government
overthrew another government a
democratically elected leader and that
today we're still trying to dictate the
terms to that government now I'm not a
fan of the Islamic Republic of course
not
it's none of our business though who the
[ __ ] rules Iran none whatsoever
and if anything us being against the
government is going to rally people to
the side of the government because
if there's anything there rallies people
together it's an outside influence
foreign invaders against them and that's
what's happening here so this is
terrible and again the u.s. word means
absolutely nothing now between the Paris
agreement and the Iran deal you know and
[ __ ] Kim Jong moon learn the lesson
for the 900 and 13th time of course I'm
never gonna give up my nukes what are
you [ __ ] crazy he might say and he
might make some real concessions but
he's never gonna [ __ ] give up his
nuke so you saw what happened with
Gaddafi he sees what happens with Iran
they don't even have nukes you made a
deal I guarantee they don't have nukes
and you still rip up the deal so get him
out of there man get this administration
out of there this is like horrendously
stupid horrendously stupid again
probably two of the best things Obama
did Paris climate agreement even though
it should have been more than that the
Republicans rejected it as a treaty
that's why it's just an agreement
because they didn't approve it to be a
treaty but the Paris climate agreement
is one and the Iran nuclear deal is
another and he's just [ __ ] ripping it
up ripping it up thrown out the window
Obamacare he's basically destroyed that
and Obamacare was a half measure to
begin with it's a right-wing idea to
begin with but it's better than what we
had but he destroyed that too that's why
four million people have lost their
health insurance since Trump became
president four million people so that's
he doesn't have an ideology he doesn't
have a philosophy he's the FoxNews
president it's a bad deal I heard it was
a bad deal from [ __ ] Brian Kilmeade
and Greg Gutfeld and [ __ ] you know
it's Steve Doocy to genius Steve Doocy
I heard it was a bad deal so what we're
gonna do it's a terrible deal we're
gonna make a really good deal and we're
gonna have the strongest sanctions or
something will happen yeah so just
casually threaten other countries even
though we got a deal where we got
everything we wanted so [ __ ] this
they're they're a bunch of loathsome
cretins and simply if you think
otherwise you just don't know what the
[ __ ] you're talking about you don't know
anything you don't know anything about
what you're talking about you haven't
read the deal when I read the deal I was
like holy [ __ ] this is I honestly
thought this is too hard on Iran
like I'm amazed that they agreed to this
in the first place oh and final point I
hello everybody was Gucci welcome to the
show
was the deal new error for the Knicks Oh
new head coach right yeah new head coach
today you said you like him he told me
that yesterday yeah yeah like this one I
think it'll be good
I mean they've done this so many times
that like you're bound to hit like
you're bound to get one right after a
while you know that's a good philosophy
well whatever maybe at some point it'll
be good they said like bit for the last
since 2001 maybe or something like every
two years they've had a coach was all
metallic so it's something stupid like
that well which one I think I think we
were both kind of upset when they let
Woodson go right yeah I mean I was
indifferent about what city were I
different yeah I mean they had they had
a whole bunch of GM's that I was mad
that they let go yeah the goal of Donnie
Walsh
um Grunwald was another good one Glen
Grunwald Glen Greenwald Glen that's
impressive man you're busy guy yeah yeah
I think I think I was upset about
Woodson being let go because if I'm not
mistaken it was Woodson who was the
coach when we got a little bit deep in
the playoffs that year but yeah but you
made the point that it was mostly
because a Jason Kidd because we finally
had a point guard who could put
everything together
yeah veteran team that like he didn't
need to coach you know similar to like
any guy who coaches LeBron that's right
you don't have you don't have to coach
him like man how impressive is LeBron
it's it's absurd even tight you do see
Tiger was talking about yeah they asked
him a question about it and he kind of
rift on it for a while but like you're
like talking about like the greatest
athletes in the sport to one of the
greatest athletes and like he subtly was
like giving answers about himself
exactly I was just gonna say it was
about both like him and LeBron he was
like as you get older you have to figure
out a new way to do it cuz you're not as
athletic as you were when you were
younger and everybody will make somebody
legend areas with standing over a period
of time you know doing it for decades
and
I'm like yo just come out and say all
the [ __ ] you've done suddenly exactly
we're with you here from 97 from 1997
until 2013 he dominated golf yeah which
is like wowzers
but his [ __ ] now is almost like a little
bit like show us you could do it when
you're older - you know cuz a lot of
these greats
LeBron's in his 15 C 15 season gretzky
like one out when he was old as [ __ ]
Jeter was old as [ __ ] like so Tiger he's
not like 50 he's like around knows that
forgives that he's 42
Phil Phil Mickelson won the British Open
at age 43 when I filled it and have
[ __ ] four back surgeries
yeah but then again Tiger won after he
his knee so he got in he had knee
surgery a bunch of times he won after
that but like this is like if he wins
now it's almost like it solidifies his
[ __ ] I mean he's already solidified
that's that's what I was gonna say is
like I actually think that the the
Great's believe it or not are underrated
like I think Kobe Bryant is massively
underrated and he's overshadowed by like
since MJ had six rings and they only got
to five like he's kind of forgotten but
Kobe
I think he's underrated I think LeBron
is probably underrated like even though
everybody recognizes they're great you
don't really get how great they are like
you don't really get it nobody really
gets it like there was the other day I
went to Tiger Woods Wikipedia page look
not his Wikipedia page it's a separate
Wikipedia page that's like Tiger Woods
accomplishments and I read through it
all the list is just never-ending
yeah it just never ends yeah it just
kept going and I was like even if you
just add on [ __ ] like Nickelodeon Kids
Choice [ __ ] and [ __ ] like that he's
probably won so many useless Awards this
was legit a copy this wasn't that kind
of [ __ ] but um yeah I think he already
proved but the fact that he came in
second already after his fourth back
surgery he came in second already in a
tournament and he came in seventh at a
different tournament and even when he
plays [ __ ] he's been playing shitty like
the past two tournaments he still made
the cut like people are forgetting like
maybe his most
impressive one of his most impressive
achievements was he holds the all-time
cut record on the PGA Tour
so - the way it works in a golf
tournament
Thursday and Friday those are the first
two days of the tournament and then I'm
sorry Thursday Friday yeah and then
Saturday and Sunday is when they
conclude but after the first two days
they cut the field in half so you could
be a professional golfer and make no
money because you could just miss the
cut every week so then they won't be a
professional golfer for that long cuz
they can't [ __ ] afford I mean it
really is like really difficult so he
made like a hundred and forty two cuts
in a row
meaning for a hundred and forty two
tournaments a hundred and forty two
weeks he never finished in the bottom
half of the field and these are the best
players in the world that's like an
mind-boggling yeah you know there was
another time you won like seven
tournaments in a row which again is not
it that's not a thing like that's not a
thing that happens when you're pets like
LeBron exactly he's been - this is gonna
be his eighth Eastern Conference Finals
in a row like and he told everybody
there he it doesn't matter you could
like I told you the onion had a joke
article the other week where it was like
LeBron thanks Cavaliers management for
having four other human bodies on the
court so that they don't forfeit to the
other team or something like that
SNL did a funny skit I don't know if you
saw it it was cut for time this week but
it was just like LeBron and for schlubs
like in the in the promo and they were
like hyping him up and they're like I
run the pick-and-roll
LeBron I pick up his laundry and then I
roll it over to his house after the
games like it was like it was a good
skit that's what it is
he's playing with a bunch of [ __ ]
idiots who don't know how to do anything
but people are impressed and I just
thought of this right now but people are
impressed with I guess Sports is
different because you're actually you're
you you're using your body and you're
physically like you know putting
yourself out there whereas in other any
other profession someone who's older and
more experienced is typically known to
be like you know better at something yes
whereas in sports it's like you see
LeBron in his 15 season because they're
not as athletic anymore so people think
but even on that front LeBron is kind of
a freak yeah but you would think because
they
so long and they were good at a young
age they'd almost be better better just
off of the fact that like mentally they
know ins and outs of the games better or
well yeah they know all the nuances they
know all the things that when you're in
your first second or third year and
you're new out there you're just running
and gunning and going off sheer
athleticism yeah and then there's guys
who are intelligent that's another thing
they say about LeBron is that he has one
of the highest basketball IQs of anybody
ever yeah he's smart guy yeah but it
would be a fun who'd be a fun test to
see if they just pulled a random person
from the crowd to fill in for the coach
like first series like the NBA Finals
against the Warriors they just pulled in
some random slump yeah wins like a
contest they could basically be this far
if they got rid of jr. Smith and gave
you jr. Smith spot yeah like they could
conceivably be this far
even though jr. played well he did an
interview right after they swept and um
he was talking about playing golf but
they're like how green is your light
right now like when you play like
referencing like you know can you shoot
any shot that you want he was like it's
not as green as about as what I'm about
to hit tomorrow and like everybody
thought he was talking about smoking
weed is he so into playing golf I didn't
get it I was like we would yeah but like
the way he was talking like everyone
knows jr. is just smoking weed oh hell
yeah
that um but he loves God he really loves
golf he's really into golf there's a
limit that our Steph Curry's really into
it and he's he's good he's good
Andre Iguodala plays - but he's not
nearly as good as Steph about Tony Romo
plays Oh Tony lawyer tries to qualify
for the US Open like every year yeah is
he good he's he's really good as a club
player like as a like he could be a club
champion somewhere which is nothing to
scoff at like he's good but no he's not
good enough to compete with the big boys
but even like I you know I was saying
that about Steph everybody probably
remembers on Kyle and Korra and I was
talking about like there's no way he's
gonna make the cut and he didn't make
the cut but I honestly thought he was
gonna shoot in the 80s and he didn't he
shot like 74 seven
four or something yeah really [ __ ]
good would you put it this way I've been
playing golf almost my whole life and
I'm pretty good but he would erect me he
would erect me so yeah I mean any
professional athlete I mean yeah but I
know you put him in you don't think have
you put him in any other probably not
swimming a lot of NBA guys don't
couldn't swimming MJ plays golf I could
[ __ ] him up at golf you think so yeah
he's not good but supposedly bets a lot
of [ __ ] money set he says he's good
and he thinks he's good he's not good
they had like he used to play in like
the Pebble Beach pro-am or whatever
mm-hmm and where they have like
celebrities and then the pro golfers
yeah and apparently they like number one
they only showed his good shots but
number two you could tell right away
when you look at a golfer like if
they're if there's even a remote
possibility of them being good at that
moment you know what I mean you could
tell you could see it in their swing
like how moved their swing is how much
control the club they have and MJ just
looks like a [ __ ] it's like a hacker
like a week earlier which is kind of
crazy when you think about it cuz a guy
who's arguably the best ever in one
sport and like you put him in this other
sport he just doesn't know the [ __ ] he's
doing but I'm surprised he probably
thinks he's the best because I mean he
was the best at another support so
anything else he probably plays he
probably thinks he's a [ __ ] oh yeah he's
got that competitive mentality mm-hm but
if he's being ruthlessly honest with
himself he would admit that he kind of
sucks at golf but it's always it like if
I were to try to pick golf club and
swing lefty I could try to start the
game over again like and try to build up
from scratch again to get good because
we're just swinging the opposite way of
what you normally swing is like that's
how hard it is for everybody when they
first start golf like you just can't
that's [ __ ] impossible all before we
go any further let's do the polls
because I didn't do the polls or em poll
since like 88
so you said Cool Ranch versus Nacho
Cheese Doritos yeah I'm cool ranch 100%
I know a lot of people on the nacho
cheese side of it oh it's so weird a
chalupa commercial just came on and
every one Taco Bell did there they did
the shell they did like a nacho cheese
and a Cool Ranch shell mm-hmm the only
time I think nacho cheese would be
better is in a Taco Bell shell I don't
think it works Cool Ranch for the taco
bell shell so here's my thing I like
nacho cheese better oh yeah
but nacho cheese is about to get [ __ ]
up by Cool Ranch yeah seriously it's
about to get [ __ ] up by cool right the
fact that they get all those colors on
one little chip is a little impressive
also a little like sprinkled green [ __ ]
we don't you know what the [ __ ] we're
eating that could be anything they could
say oh that's [ __ ] arsenic and we'd
be like all right I've heard a rumor
that like the reason Corona is yellow is
because it's made in some dirty factory
in the bot like the bottle like did you
ever hear that rumor about Manos I never
heard that but that sounds like [ __ ]
because all beers yellow no like
something with the pipes in the corona
factory or something and that's the
reason why something or other there's
some myth about Coronas that was that
but like all these factories you don't
know what the [ __ ] goes on I mean like I
heard a story of someone drinking from a
soda can and they got poisoned because
there was like rat piss on the cut on
the top of it or something to this man
there was okay there was a time I had a
Sierre of what is it Sierra Nevada or
something like that the name you know
see it's a beer like Sierra Nevada
something sounds familiar yeah something
like that and I had it and at the I
finished it and then I looked in the
bottle and it looked like there was a
[ __ ] little rat in there
stop it swear to God I swear to God but
what had happened no no but this is what
happened this would happen I drank it I
finished it and then I had left it like
out on the dresser or something and then
when I woke up in the morning and then
like halfway through the day I picked it
up and I was gonna put it in the [ __ ]
recycling or whatever and that's when I
looked in and I saw it and I was like
that [ __ ] can't get in the bot how does
that I was like there's again the 50%
chance I drank this with this dead rat
inside and it was at the factory it got
in there somehow and then but there's a
chance some house out in the bottle take
like yes we were like super [ __ ] up in
the youth I had never seen a rat ever
this was way back when I when I used to
live in my mom's basement I never saw a
rat ever and I saw I didn't think there
were any rats there so I thought there's
a good chance that that [ __ ] was in the
bottle when I drank it dead and then I
was literally thinking about suing them
I was like I was gonna say you because I
thought I was gonna get sick I thought I
was gonna get like some [ __ ] crazy
illness from it hell yeah it was one of
the it was a very like I was shook over
that experience I was shook I normally
the last thing that crosses in my mind
is suing like a company or suing
somebody just because like no I
literally considered it I was like I get
sick I'm a hundred percent suing I
wouldn't even thought about getting sick
if that's if I saw that [ __ ] I would
have first through the [ __ ] up I almost
did but it was like a day later or
something and I just like I literally I
didn't know if it got in there when I
was done drinking here they they don't
know that [ __ ] I know yeah I know
I bought dog food once a big-ass bag of
dog food from Petco open this [ __ ] up
and I guess this happens too but there
was like little maggot things like on
all of the arm on all the little dog
food things can't even give that to your
dog no hell no I was like I want to I
didn't write to the company or anything
but I went back to the store and I was
like what the [ __ ] it's this they're
like yeah sometimes the bigger bags if
they stay on the bottom of the shelves
they get those and like or the batch can
be bad from the factory and I was like
the give me a new bag I think I got a
new dog food or I don't even know maybe
I just returned it and went to a
different store or something but that
was discussed and I opened the bag I
think I was feeding my dogs from it for
a little bit but like you don't know
what the [ __ ] these factories are
probably disgusting oh this [ __ ] yeah
our food is not made in a way we're like
everything is so clean and
I mean that was what that old famous
book was about the jungle was it called
I don't know I Upton Sinclair that was
about like the meat industry in the US
and just how disgusting everything was
and by the way the name is Sierra Nevada
yeah but that's like that's a like a
meat like a lot of these bigger
companies like I've been to a brewery
tour in Milwaukee and it was Coors um
Miller my life mm-hmm and the factory
looked like pristine clean but like
they're also giving tours so like that
shit's gonna be top of the line and
little clean as [ __ ] you know but like
some smaller rent like Heinz ketchup I'm
sure they're their factory is clean and
on point but like Hunt's bougie ass
[ __ ] ketchup is not up to par because
they're not giving any tours anything
that [ __ ] down yeah anything that's
mass-produced is gonna be questionable
the origins of it but even the [ __ ]
that's not mass-produced like we eat
animals so when you eat animals it's
like it already is not like a clean
thing by its nature I'm going beyond
that like I saw it when I went I went to
Petco today to pick up dog food the dude
in front of me had like a Pizza Hut
shirt on like not some [ __ ] that you
could play it was like he worked at
Pizza Hut and like he was there was a
little you know when you go to KFC and
you buy like a chicken tenders and and
they put it in that little mmm
yep cardboard package sure he had two of
those on the counter and I was like
looking at it and there was something
like peeking it's like mouth out through
like like little there was like tiny
little holes and it said like live
animal on it he had like little mices in
there and he was just disgusting his
[ __ ] and the kid looked like like dirty
not judging him but he didn't look like
clean and I was like that dude is
probably either just getting off work at
Pizza Hut or about to go do some weird
[ __ ] with these mices and then go to
work and I like Pizza Hut
so so he's gonna [ __ ] up my food because
we're in the same town oh no so like the
guy who delivers the food from pizza my
husband lice and cardboard thing yeah
and like what if he's delivering
just oh i'm skeptical of all food-like
but it's all the way around the top of
my [ __ ] we live in the world so like
there's no way around that like [ __ ] is
gonna be grimy I know but that was one
of that jarred me the [ __ ] the little
mouse story but but you get over
everything like did you probably you
probably told yourself to next day like
I'm never having this beer ever again
and or disgusted but now if someone gave
you that [ __ ] you probably never I
wouldn't drink it I wouldn't drink it
from there so if someone had a case of
that [ __ ] like you you'd go out your way
to say like nah I'm not sure I don't
think that drinking that [ __ ] no I'm not
drinking that [ __ ] I mean I've had
experiences like that where my reaction
has been like nope like there was one
time I don't know if I've ever told the
story on the podcast but there was one
time where I was sitting at home this
was I was probably in middle school at
the time
I was sitting at home I was eating a ham
sandwich and in the middle of me eating
the ham sandwich I felt like I was
having a heart attack it would it felt
Jordan Peterson and Matt Dillahunty had
a discussion or it might be a debate
recently I'm not sure which it is there
was an event and they were both in it
and the needle drop Anthony Fontenot
tweeted this video I want to share with
you for those you who don't know Matt
Dillahunty is from the Atheist
experience which i think is a local show
in Houston is it I think it's somewhere
in Texas and it's a an atheist call-in
show it's pretty interesting show I like
the format of it where they just kind of
shoot the [ __ ] with whoever calls and
they discuss issues of theism deism
atheism and stuff like that and of
course Jordan Peterson is now and now
everybody knows who Jordan Peterson is
he's a guy who kind of rose to fame
online and kind of defines himself in
this anti social justice warrior way so
he's he's made a very lucrative career
out of going after the goofy
authoritarian kids on college campuses
who like 2d platformer people and censor
people and whatnot but he also kind of
links in along with that aspect of his
ideology he's also kind of like a
self-help guru if you will like he has
this book 12 rules for life and you get
this sense that he's he's a self-help
guru kind of character and he also mixes
in pretty conservative politics along
with a religious worldview so that's why
this clip is interesting because you get
a sense of how Jordan Peterson really
thinks so here's Jordan Peterson - Matt
Dillahunty talking about the issue of
God they would be afraid of what we
would lose if we lost religion and I
basically said demonstrate to me any
benefit oh you'd lose art and poetry and
drama and narrative are there are there
no godless artists and poets there are
artists and poets who think they're
godless so we might have crossed over
into a problem area yes
I don't actually I can't draw for crap
although I do draw during the show but
one of the individuals who came to the
show the other night handed me something
that she had spent a great deal of time
drawing she's a wonderful artist I'm
very grateful to get it and you know
while I pretend to read minds onstage I
constantly acknowledge that I can't
actually read minds so I can't tell you
whether or not she actually believes in
a God but I can tell you that I actually
don't believe in a God and I could read
yeah coach for you huh buddy act like
you do that's why you didn't say I'm off
the stage no now you're making a claim
okay so I'm telling you I don't believe
there's a god and your response to that
is I really do because I have a moral
sense but my moral sense is utterly
without any appeal to a god explicitly
or implicitly see what's interesting
about a guy like Jordan Peterson is that
he's managed to take these arguments
that you know you go back five years ago
or eight years ago online and basically
the entire online community was unified
against shitty points like this the idea
that oh you're an atheist and your moral
well then you just think you're an
atheist because really you believe in
God on some level and that's why you're
acting in a moral way you know if this
is an argument that was presented by Ken
Ham which by the way it is he's made
that point before if it's an argument
presented by Ray Comfort by the way it
is he's made that argument before if it
was an argument put forth by any
creationist type character or religious
character the entire internet would you
know spread their ass cheeks and [ __ ]
all over the face of the argument and
say you are that's the stupidest thing
I've ever [ __ ] heard but you know
Jordan Peterson has this remarkable
ability to garner a giant crowd and
following to his arguments even when he
crosses the line
into the fundamentally absurd and that's
what this is and you know naturally
there's gonna be a thousand people who
who come to this segment and say oh I'm
mischaracterizing him or I don't
understand his argument or whatever the
case is listen man you go back and
listen that as many times as you want
you could take as much context into it
as you want
at no point does it start to make more
sense so his point is no if you act in a
moral ethical way you you by definition
or not an atheist you on some level are
a believer in God and a Christian God at
that so you believe in Yahweh and Jesus
in order to act in this moral sense
listen if you can't see the flaws in
that argument then you you're not as
bright as you think you are let's put it
that way because that's that's a non
falsifiable claim so in other words it
if somebody says to Jordan Peterson um
I'm religious and that person acts in a
moral way he'll go great then your moral
because you're religious but if somebody
says to Jordan Peterson I'm
non-religious and they act in a moral
way he goes great that's because you're
actually religious whether or not you
know it sin there's there's nothing that
can disprove that claim which is
fundamentally absurd because that means
you hold it as an axiomatic truth you
hold it up as a claim of this by its
very nature cannot be argued against so
no amount of empirical evidence no
amount of data doesn't matter how much
somebody insists on what they believe to
him he knows what you believe better
than you know what you believe you know
that that idea if it's ever used against
him everybody would rightly say oh my
god you're strong Manning Jordan
Peterson but if he tells you would you
believe they're like no on some level he
knows better than you do about what you
believe no he doesn't so I do not
believe in God and I never would ever
murder somebody ever think about
and murdering somebody would never
assault somebody would never rape
somebody would never steal and he says
well that has to be grounded in a
Christian metaphysics in order for you
to believe that's on some level you've
bought into the Christianity no or
number one my natural inclination is to
not do those things because something on
a very gut visceral innate level feels
wrong with that and this before I ever
had any teachings of Christianity
something felt wrong about that so
there's an innate moral structure to
begin with but on top of that now that
I'm an adult and I've thought through
these issues I can give you reasons why
I act this way without making any
appeals to you know zombie Jewish
carpenters in the sky so you know in my
mind
morality really manifests itself as a
mixture of in my mind the golden rule is
one thing I see the the fundamental
logic of the golden rule I see how it's
a rational way to act in the world
I don't want to treat other people as I
wouldn't like to be treated
now that is decoupled from any religious
conception of the Golden Rule the idea
of the golden rule existed before
religions existed because it's a way to
go along to get along in society to make
everything go smoothly and to make it so
that there's no I'm not creating
unnecessary threats to my own life and
again I'm also not treating other people
as I wouldn't want to be treated there's
something about that that it just on its
face is a common sense position it's a
it's a reasonable thing to do and it is
an ethical thing to do and you could
tell because it does the least amount of
harm to the most people so there's some
mix of utility version of utilitarianism
mixed in with the idea of the Golden
Rule you know mixed in with this idea of
human rights that strikes me as what
morality is and what ethics are and you
don't need to make appeals to the
supernatural in order to believe this
way and act this way in the world and in
fact many other people have made the
argument and I think there's some truth
in this
that if anything the scarier thing
it's what jordan peterson is alluding to
the idea that oh you need to act moral
because there's a god so if you ask
somebody hey why are you not rampaging
and murdering people and their answer is
simply because I'm afraid of the
punishment my sky daddy will give me
when I die well then that's actually a
terrible reason to not that's a terrible
reason to act morally because what
you're saying is me acting morally is
solely contingent on the the space daddy
metaphorically spanking me in the
afterlife me going to hell and burning
forever well then the obvious problem
arises what if you're not what if there
is no space daddy and they are not gonna
[ __ ] punish you in the afterlife
which is the reality there is no space
daddy there's not gonna punch you in the
afterlife well the implication is
obviously I would probably rape and
pillage and [ __ ] steal and act
immorally
in that scenario if you tell me there's
no God what reason is there to act good
so that's what's scary somebody who the
only thing holding them back from acting
in an immoral fashion is this idea of
this non-existent being that's scary
that's somebody you don't want to hang
out with you know but I think I think
most people even if they are religious
and you talk to them they go yeah even
if there isn't a God so in other words
even if on some level they're agnostic I
would still act in this way where I
treat other people like I want to be
tweeted a treat tweeted I treat other
people like I want to be treated because
it's fundamentally the the rational
thing to do the logical thing to do the
right thing to do and all you need to do
is understand the the fundamental
principle of treating others as you
would like to be treated to get that you
know to not do unnecessary harm in the
world and inflict pain on people is
enough for me I understand that negative
emotions are are terrible and so I
wouldn't want to inflict negative
emotions on other people because then
I'm adding to the net harm in the world
and the hurt in the world and life's
hard enough as is without my dumbass
adding to somebody else's pain but to
him it's like all this [ __ ] is like that
doesn't strike him as a compelling
enough reason to act moral to him you
need to invoke metaphysical [ __ ] and
listen if you still want to defend him
on some level just take out his appeals
to you know God in a deist accent's or
in the Christian sense that theistic
Christian sense and add in [ __ ] Vishnu
or add in Allah you know which means God
by the way but add in the notion of
Islam like imagine it's easy to imagine
in an Islamic scholar saying well no you
need Islam to be moral it's just as
stupid this what Jordan etirsa sin is
saying is just as stupid as an Islamic
scholar saying you need Islam to be
moral so any does he really believe that
if you get rid of or you really lose art
poetry and drama and narrative as he
calls it if you get rid of rid of
religion because that's what he argued
he just said that if you get rid of if
you get rid of religion you get rid of
art poetry karma and narrative or drama
not karma I'd my chicken scratched here
I mean again that would easily be
disproven by pointing to all the
non-religious brilliant artists that
existed but then he reverts to no they
just think they're non-religious they're
not actually non-religious I mean that
she's really sad and dumb I don't know
how else to respond to it just take
people at their [ __ ] word men take
them at their word don't think you know
better than they do because frankly you
don't you don't way before I ever got
any religious teaching whatsoever I have
felt on some level that acting certain
ways is wrong and immoral and unethical
and so there's much more evidence in my
mind for innate moral principles an
innate moral structure in human beings
and
the the the Chomsky argument of and he
proved this with language which adds
even more credence to the argument my
opinion but the idea is just like your
eye is it's a biological entity you know
and there you have the preconditions to
have an eye and your eye has capacities
and it has limits but the eye is
something that's in your genetic
structure and by the same token just
like any other body bodily system
biological system develops over time
morality is no different just because
morality is not something you can touch
you know oh you could touch somebody's
arm so you know it's an arm you can
touch somebody's foot or somebody's hair
well just because morality is not
something you could touch doesn't mean
that there's not an innate moral
structure and again the reason why this
is so compelling to me is because he
proved that in language the idea used to
be you're a lump of clay and you know
you well the way you learned to speak is
simply by absorbing the words around you
from everybody else and then as you grew
up you could piece together the words
that you learn from other people and
string together sentences well it turns
out that's not true because kids are
able to string together much more
complex sentences than things they had
ever heard before so if you're able to
to basically structure a sentence even
in when there's a lack of knowledge or
the words necessary well then that shows
that there's something else at play here
it's not just that you absorb from your
environment and regurgitate that proves
there's an innate structure for language
and language again is also something you
can't touch language but it's a
biological system by the same token
morality you can't touch more Allie but
it's a biological system so there's
capacities and there's limits and you
know sometimes there are aberrations and
people who do get some sort of sick
pleasure out of murdering people but
it's exactly that
[ __ ] aberration the overwhelming
majority people do not feel on a casual
Sunday night like oh it would be the
right thing to do to go [ __ ] bash
somebody's head in with a sledgehammer
so in my mind there's a tremendous
amount more evidence of an innate
morality in an eight morality or ethical
code than there is for this idea that in
order to act rational in order to act in
a moral way you need appeals to old
fairy tales from thousands of years ago
and I haven't even brought up the fact
that in the those books that he's
referencing in all these religious books
they don't just teach good things you
could take a fifth-grader sit them down
and say come up with their list of 10
things you should never any human being
should never do and that fifth-grader
will come up with the better list than
what the [ __ ] Ten Commandment says
because the Ten Commandments includes
honor your mother and father what if
they're your mother and father are bad
people written they're [ __ ] and
they've abused you and they raped you
like what if that was the case you know
don't make images to other gods that's
gonna be on your list of top 10 10
things to never do and then there's rape
in the Bible there's [ __ ] slavery in
the Bible there's genocide in the Bible
they give they give exact instructions
on how you're supposed to treat your
slaves so the idea that in order for a
human being to act in a way that's moral
and in order to create beautiful art and
poetry and drama the idea that you need
a [ __ ] contradictory massively
contradictory book from the Bronze Age
in order to act that way is frankly
absurd and you know this is what you're
in Peterson does he sprinkles in a bunch
of things that make sense
but then he slips in you know his own
political and religious ideology at the
same time and usually his political and
religious stuff is just almost standard
run-of-the-mill conservative opinion
[ __ ] just like Bill O'Reilly you're just
like Sean Hannity so even though in
don't get me wrong he's much smarter
than those guys there's no doubt about
that but he's equally
wrong on these points as would be a guy
like Bill O'Reilly so don't get it
twisted and don't sell your mind to a
charlatan because you agree with other
aspects of what he might say
hello everybody we're here time for the
podcast
after the podcast we just had a 10
minute podcast and we're like wait we're
not even recording I'm like [ __ ]
sweating you ever like do some physical
activity [ __ ] and then try to do
something serious afterwards but not
that this is serious but like like if
you work out and then you try to shower
real fast and like put your clothes on
you're just like you just can't stop
sweating oh the number of times I've
gotten out of the shower put on
moisturizer and then like did something
and then realize like 10 minutes later
that the moisturizer was now mixed in
with moisturizer and sweat oh I can't
even count the number of times that
happened that happened all the [ __ ]
time yeah oh it's one thing if you sweat
like if you're in the gym and you sweat
and you take a towel and you wipe it off
and you're good but if you are sweating
and then you shower and then try to put
your clothes on real quick and like if
you have a meeting or if like you're
meeting up with someone you meet them
and you're just like [ __ ] constantly
sweating it's not something that you
would wipe real quit just doesn't stop I
don't know that's like your your more
amped up your nerves are high or
whatever you know I've had that before
for sure I don't know if you know I'm
sure you did notice but when I did TYT
they had me under the brightest lights
ever and I didn't have any like powder
or makeup on it just crossed my mind but
and I don't have I used to have oily
skin I don't have any skin anymore but
under those lights I look like I was it
was so bad little thing I was sweating
basically yeah just shiny but well you
said at Fox News they put like coats and
coats of makeup on you right and it's
like when you looked at it on air you
sort of look normal
well that's right not only do they put a
bunch of makeup on you they use like six
shades too dark because they say the
lights are so bright that if they don't
give you a darker color makeup for your
face that you would look really really
white so they got to give you a darker
shade and I never realized the extent to
which that when they put makeup on your
face it's just like they're it's
basically like they are painting your
face with peach paint like that's what
it like they glob it on and then they
take a thing and [ __ ] put it
everywhere
it's literally like you might as well
take a [ __ ] paintbrush and just
like do that [ __ ] the first thing that
comes to mind when you say all that [ __ ]
is the mrs. Doubtfire mass like as soon
as you're done yeah you could almost
just be like take the whole [ __ ] off and
just be back to normal that's such a
great movie missed a fire
it never doesn't make me smile like I
always smile makes me smile but I get
depressed watching it because I know
that like the situations like [ __ ] oh
well then at the end full of the kids
right or she does she or he I don't
remember at the end like because I
remember he's doing like the puppet show
well maybe he gets it's a happy ending I
think it's a happy ending I don't
remember exactly how the happy ending
unfolds but that every scene in that
movie I like I like when he shoves his
face in the cake to cover up his head
he's like oh it's a facemask deer yeah
that's a claw that's a classic I thought
you might like by the way like my
grandma on my dad's side the Grubman
down fires seriously yeah and there's a
professional golfer everybody should
look this up right now there's a
professional golfer by the name of Colin
Montgomery type Colin Montgomery into
Google Images I've heard of him that's
miss Doubtfire as a man like that's
Robin Williams is not miss Doubtfire as
a man Colin Montgomery's missed out
fires man really he's got like the
grayish [ __ ] like he just looks like
Miss Doubtfire he's a man that looks
like Miss Doubtfire and then there's
another golfer his name's Charley
Hoffman and look him up guys he's the
human embodiment of Chris Griffin if
Chris really
Chris Griffin was a real a person to
real life it would be Charlie Hoffman I
feel like that wouldn't be a compliment
to him no it's not a compliment
it's just a steam in a fact yeah just
what he is he just looks exactly like
him
people never give me compliments like
that I get like like a like it I always
get like a in between compliment like
you look like what do I get
Shia LaBeouf you look Keanu Reeves oh my
god is that good or bad like um I don't
really see either one you look like
Horan to me cuz I've known you for so
long I never associated you with a
celebrity or anything and I'm sure you
never associated me with one no my
stepfather though looks like a
combination of like Jerry Springer and
Larry Bird yeah you made that point for
he definitely does so it would probably
be annoying just going through your
whole life hearing like just like oh you
look like this person or like cuz you
know people say you look like that there
is a dude who people say you look like
Joey salads or some [ __ ] is that his
name Joey salads salads some some
youtuber I think or something oh that
sounds like a dude I used to play at the
club with us I know right a Joey salads
over he give me like four hundred pounds
or some [ __ ] like that
that's how all Italians would do it they
would have the most like nickname that
you'd be like you'd be like like Paulie
doesn't smokes smokes all the time wait
can I just ask how he got that nickname
like yeah yeah yeah you know smoking his
whole life don't worry about it that's
what they'd say how do you get that
nickname don't worry about it give a my
lighting here I read some of the
comments man people well first off shout
out - we were talking before the podcast
pimple Update [ __ ] has gone down so [ __ ]
everybody who was saying hurtful
meaningful [ __ ] man no [ __ ] all you guys
dude don't feel bad
I you know the most embarrassing [ __ ]
that I would never have admitted to at
the time we've spoken about this before
on the podcast but back in high school
when my acne was bad I would put cover
up on like dot to cover up over it so I
was like wearing makeup but then if
anybody had ever brought that up to me
in it back then I'd be like no what are
you talking about I'm not wearing makeup
what are you talking about but I would
read [ __ ] and like I mean I'm not like
people say [ __ ] but I'm not like on a
celebrity level where they're getting
hurtful [ __ ] and all this stuff but it's
like I just laughed at all of it like
funk like and get what would disagree
with you more like is there anything
that ever like I mean you can always
have an argument back cuz I mean
normally you're you're right about [ __ ]
and if you're wrong you could say you're
wrong about it but like is anything ever
hurtful
no dings so that was mean the things
that the thing like if you insult my
appearance it doesn't bother me in the
slightest like I've been called every
name in the book your people say yeah
and it's fine and go to see yeah some of
it lesbian softball coach some of the
funny like that's [ __ ] funny I think
that is [ __ ] entertaining so some of
its genuinely entertaining so I don't
mind this stuff where they come after it
my physical appearance or anything like
that
the only thing I get really frustrated
about where it hurts is when somebody
types something and it sounds like they
really believe what they're saying and
it's they're totally mischaracterizing a
point I made or something like Bill like
I saw one the other day um there's been
a bunch but what did it say there were a
few I'm getting them jumbled in my head
right now they're not coming to me at
the moment they will come to me at some
point so just basically saying you're
lying about something when I context
like there was one that's it like I had
said something a while ago like if you
don't give trunk credit for something
that he when he does something right
then you're a partisan hack mm-hmm and
what somebody did is they quote tweeted
my thing and tweeted at me and said well
I guess you're a partisan hack and like
I think what they were referring to was
my segment on the North Korea South
Korea peace deal and like I made the
point in that video that the bulk of the
credit goes to the South Korean
president because it's a new South
Korean president and he's been pro-peace
all along and so he's the guy who had a
meeting with Kim jong-un
sat down and they made this whole big
thing and they basically agreed to end
the war now Trump is trying to take
credit for that
od well right so PC lying when he said
that Kim Jong and like gave him credit
no see that's the thing and in the in
the segment I break it down that's been
a strategy of this South Korean
president from day one this guy's really
smart he knows that not only does he
have to make peace with North Korea
which is something he wants but also at
the same time he knows how hawkish and
and how much people in the u.s. want war
with like John Bolton and Mike Pompeo
and Trump so what he's been doing is
using strategic flattery as they call it
so every time he achieves something
he turns around and he gives Trump
credit and in fact that he said the
other day because Trump people at a
rally were started for cheering for
Trump to get a Nobel Peace Prize yeah
but this South Korean president was like
I think he should get a Nobel Peace
Prize so that's not him he's not an
idiot he doesn't actually think Trump
should get a Nobel Peace Prize but it's
a it's a strategy it's trying to get
peace and trying to stave off the war
mongers by letting Trump take credit for
[ __ ] that he doesn't deserve credit for
so but even saying all that I still said
in that segment as long as Donald Trump
doesn't start a hot war with North Korea
I will consider him a success on the
issue of North Korea that's my standard
for the issue of North Korea as long as
you're not getting into a war because
virtually every administration and the
entire deep State for decades in the
u.s. has wanted war with North Korea so
as long as you don't fight a war I will
consider you a success so by my own
standard I think Donald Trump's so far
is a success on North Korea even though
he's heading saint's insane [ __ ] but the
points a low bar I know but but that's
my thing is like I'm below totally
honest and straightforward about what
the facts are and what my take on the
facts is and still some idiot tweets me
and he's like I guess you're a partisan
hack what do you want because what do
you what did you want did you want me to
say
Trump deserves a hundred percent of the
credit for something he does not deserve
1% of the credit for because that'd be
ridiculous and they don't they probably
don't even know the backstory that there
was a right-wing anti-peace president in
South Korea president Park and then she
was impeached over corruption and then
this new guy's pro-peace like what do
they want they want the new South Korean
president to get none of the credit even
though he deserves a lot of the credit
like that's it [ __ ] like that that
annoys me where it's like somebody will
say something and they'll like they'll
tell me what they think I believe and
then tell me it's wrong it's like well
first of all I'm not wrong second of all
what you're telling me that you think I
believe is not even what I believe so
it's like multiple layers of like you're
just trouble it's like these people
search for [ __ ]
to try to be catch me and be like argh I
gotcha
don't you know and it's like that's the
[ __ ] that annoys me yes you know then
it's like then you have to start
weighing okay let's see oh this person
has four followers I'll just love just
not [ __ ] respond and I'll just let it
go out there into the ether and then
sometimes you see in the person as a
thousand followers and their [ __ ]
tweet got like two retweets and four
likes and you're like now I kind of want
to respond because not only are you
spewing your [ __ ] but you might be
getting other people to believe some
[ __ ] that is just not that's not true
another one that annoy me was somebody
tweeted me and said props to whatever
left-wing outlets had covered a story
about the MSNBC host Joann read and the
ridiculous lie she told you doubt so
[ __ ] weird
they were like props to her it props to
those people for covering it and then it
was like shame on [ __ ] Kyle me and
like four other left-wing youtubers who
didn't cover it and are protecting her
and I read that I'm like [ __ ] I
haven't had a show since the scandal
broke like I haven't had a show yet and
then I'm just because you're defending
her but that's my point is that like
people will if not only in the mind of
some people not only do you have to
cover the thing that they want you to
cover and by the way I did end up
covering that because I thought it was
newsworthy but not only do you have to
cover the thing that they want you to
cover you have to cover it in the way
they want you to cover it and you have
to do right now so it's like it's just
[ __ ] like that gets under my skin like
unreasonable expectations or just
jumping to conclusions and assuming my
beliefs or something when they're not or
assuming bad motivations like that's the
[ __ ] that I'm like that's the [ __ ] that
makes me feel like angry like I've got a
like seething anger when I read that and
I'm like yeah but I'm scrolling within
trolling because the ones that control
that are trolling I don't mind is the
ones where I read it and I'm like oh
this person's serious and they think
like they think something that's wrong
like that's the [ __ ] that gets me but I
don't give a [ __ ] about you know
whatever insulting my speaking of that
lady
I just it almost like when I read her
response to it I think I've watched the
video on it and I was almost just like
in a way that's sort of like a genius as
a response is almost just like if I did
right like I don't remember right in
that would she almost said something
just like she didn't remember writing it
right like that wasn't her she said I
genuinely don't believe I wrote those
things yeah and I was just like if
someone found something I wrote mad long
ago I can almost feel like I don't
remember I don't remember I that I wrote
that and it almost made me believe like
that like that but the hack thing was
the problem she lied if she just said I
don't remember writing it but I wrote it
that's fine but she didn't say that she
was like I was hacked and then people
were like whoa wait a second
that [ __ ] is posted on like six
different websites and you [ __ ]
tweeted it at the time like you're lying
it's an obvious lie and then went as far
as to hire her own investigator or some
[ __ ] and that dude just said whatever he
she wanted him to say it I never
understand there's companies that do
that they're like we'll have an internal
investigation but yet like they're
hiring the firm to investigate whatever
the [ __ ] going on in their company you
think they're really gonna hire someone
that's gonna be like aha we got you
you're all going to jail [ __ ]
and like you're so right about that and
I always found internal investigations
hilarious because there is a conflict of
interest the entire time like the whole
thing is a giant conflict of interest
like so what I did is I hired this guy
who's gonna tell me if I'm a good person
it's like wait what then if you're
paying him you know what that person's
gonna [ __ ] say it's like when cops oh
we have an internal investigation over a
homicide that was committed by a police
officer well you're his [ __ ] buddies
exactly that's ridiculous that's like if
somebody was like okay Kyle you need to
[ __ ] you have to do an investigation
on Koren it's like well he's my friend
what [ __ ] you talking about I'm supposed
to find dirt on it like it's just the
whole the way that structure is is just
not gonna work yeah that should they do
that with the NFL they do it like I
think the Mavericks did it and it was
just like okay no one's gonna get in
trouble because it's your investigation
yeah so
let me tell everybody about how sick
I've been recently so it started on
Thursday no it was no Tuesday remember
cuz at the end of last the last Kyle and
Koren I was like I don't feel good well
you said during the episode yeah like
that was the beginning of Iran yeah so
that was the beginning of it then it was
Wednesday and Thursday I feel like by
Thursday it was bad and then Friday
Saturday Sunday was like oh my god so
first of all we've been worse it was
like it was way worse
it was way worse so it was so bad I
thought it might have been strep throat
but ultimately it wasn't strep throat it
was it was a it was a cold but it was
the worst cold I've ever had so it
wasn't it wasn't just like blowing your
nose stuffy the throat thing was the
real problem it likes of pain have you
ever had a cold so bad that like you
almost couldn't swallow mmm not no not
really but I mean I've had that choking
sensation where I've couldn't swallow
for like a second and that [ __ ] sucks I
can't imagine what that [ __ ] feels like
for an extended amount of time what is
it like swollen were you coughing or
who's just like no that was the one
thing I wasn't coughing I wasn't
coughing I don't think I had a fever but
I had nasal
nasal congestion that was terrible so
blowing my nose and my throat was the
worst part I mean the nose I could deal
with the [ __ ] blow in your nose all
the time but the throat was I literally
had trouble swallowing
I couldn't sleep because of it it was so
bad I wasn't able to sleep that sounds
like it's [ __ ] miserable
and so I basically I was using
Chloraseptic like a [ __ ] try
spraying in the back of your throat
trying to help it to the help it helped
a little bit but it was so bad that
nothing was really gonna help and then
here's the grossest part I like every
now and then I would have to hawk these
loogies that were like half the size of
[ __ ] ping pong balls and like in the
morning especially when I woke up they
were like hard oh it's almost like iLike
I would wake up and be incapable of
following and like couldn't talk because
it was just totally scratchy and dry and
impossible to swallow it was it the
worst [ __ ] and then afterwards I was
like I'm still I'm still like at the end
of it now like I'm just getting to the
end of it hopefully tonight's the last
night where it's like really an issue
but I was like I didn't I I didn't know
that because there's a million different
kinds of common cold viruses yeah I
didn't know that this one that I had was
like possible like I didn't know that
there was one that was so bad that it
made your throat like that level yeah
like I didn't know like I've had colds
before everybody's had colds before but
usually my cold is just like I'm blowing
there's been a bizarre story developing
involving Joanne Reid the MSNBC host so
she wrote some shitty stuff in the past
on her blog about gay people and when
some people dug that up a few months ago
she came out and apologized well now
people dug up some more anti-gay stuff
some new old anti-gay stuff and this
time instead of apologizing she said she
was hacked now that's a very not only
curious thing to say it's a ridiculous
thing to say because you know for
example it was a log it was in like this
thing called the Wayback Machine and
then I think there were a variety of
sites that had logged these posts that
she made so not only would hackers have
had to go in there right the [ __ ]
she said before she was anybody before
she was really widely known they also
would have had to do it at a variety of
different sites which is like no
nobody's gonna do that and you know
people were pointing out hey the real
scandal here would be that it's possible
to hack the thing called the Wayback
Machine the site called the Wayback
Machine where you know
so then anybody's history can be changed
by anybody who would hack a site like
that and make it seem like they did it
or wrote something years ago so that's a
huge that's a huge story that would
deserve a tremendous amount of attention
because you know how can anybody trust
anything then so people were pointing
out not only is that unlikely it's damn
near impossible and then on top of that
some of the [ __ ] she wrote she tweeted
back then so she's telling us people
hacked into her blog when she was in
nobody wrote [ __ ] pretending to be her
posted it on variety of different
websites and then also tweeted it out on
her
Widder and she didn't even notice she
it's not like she you know she was she's
on Twitter she saw a somebody apparently
hacked and put words in her mouth and
then tweeted it and she wasn't alarmed
at the time she was just like oh look at
that somebody hacked me then she kept
moving on it listen it is just beyond
obnoxious in terms of the degree of a
lie that we're talking about here well
this is weird what happened now it's all
weird up to this point but what happened
next is perhaps even weirder despite
claiming that she was hacked
she also apologized again take a look
good morning and welcome to am joy a
community that I support and that I
deeply care about is hurting because of
some despicable and truly offensive
posts being attributed to me and many of
you have seen these blog posts
circulating online and in social media
many of them are homophobic
discriminatory and outright weird and
hateful when a friend found them in
December and sent them to me I was
stunned frankly I couldn't imagine where
they'd come from or whose voice that was
in the months since I've spent a lot of
time trying to make sense of these posts
I hired cyber security experts to see if
somebody had manipulated my words or my
former blog and the reality is they have
not been able to prove it but here's
what I know I genuinely do not believe I
wrote those hateful things because they
are completely alien to me but I can
definitely understand based on things I
have tweeted and have written in the
past why some people don't believe me
I've not been exempt from being dumb or
cool or hurtful to the very people I
want to advocate for I own that I get it
and for that I am truly truly sorry I
had a conversation the other day with a
friend who's also an advocate in the
LGBTQ community in Florida who rightly
took me in a task for my tweets mocking
and Coulter using trans gender
stereotypes I apologized to my friend
and I want to apologize to the trans
community and to an those tweets were
wrong and horrible I look back today at
some of the ways I've talked casually
about people and gender identity and
since
sexual orientation and I wonder who that
even was but the reality is that like a
lot of people in this country that
person was me I grew up in a household
that like many in America had
conservative views on LGBTQ issues I had
friends some of my closest friends in
fact growing up who I later learned were
gay and who had kept it secret from me
and from everyone else we were close to
because they didn't know what we would
say or if we would still be friends or
whether we would look at them
differently I can remember a friend of
mine my freshman year in college telling
me he was gay and my knee-jerk reaction
being that it was so disappointing to
the women he could have married he was
so hurt he didn't speak to me for months
I'm heartbroken that I didn't do better
back then knowing so many great people
in the LGBTQ community including amazing
friends and journalists and producers
and political operatives and great dads
and moms and advocates and just regular
people and knowing how hard it must have
been for so many of them to come out to
their families to their friends to just
walk around in the world especially for
trans people and I feel like I should
have known better than to ever write or
tweet in a way that could make fun of or
make light of or make light of that pain
and that experience even a decade ago
when the country was in a very different
place but I cannot take any of that back
I can only say that the person I am now
is not the person I was then I like to
think I've gotten better as a person
over time that I'm still growing that
I'm not the same person I was ten or
five or even one year ago and I know
that my goal is to try to be a better
person and a better Ally now the reality
is I have to own the things that I've
written and tweeted and said and I'm
hoping out of all of this there's an
opportunity to talk about the ways in
which hurtful speech really does imperil
marginal marginalized communities these
issues matter not just theoretically but
because we're talking about our friends
our kids our co-workers people who
deserve better than what I have
sometimes given them why are you
apologizing if you didn't write them now
she again she we went through this once
before they found anti-gay stuff she
wrote and then she came out and said I'm
sorry about that but now you're saying
these new ones I didn't write I was
hacked so then why are you saying that
and then apologizing for it and she said
quote I genuinely do not believe I wrote
those hateful things then again why are
you apologizing shouldn't your whole
thing be I didn't write them and
something's going on here we're gonna
get to the bottom of it I know what I
said hasn't been proven yet but I'm on a
mission to prove it because I know that
that's the case I know I didn't write
these things but she didn't she said I
genuinely do not believe I wrote those
hateful things she's saying that because
listen she wrote him and her claim was
beyond ridiculous any expert will tell
you she hired her own basically fake
expert to say yep she's right that's
what happened and then they were like
where's your evidence and he was like
new phone who dis evidence I don't know
what that means what does that mean
evidence so she listened here's the
thing man to telly
I give less than no [ __ ] about what she
said back then by the way I went through
some of it some of it you could say is
hateful others are just just strike me
as like you know crew jokes you know and
honestly it's akin to like my me and
friends of mine when you said I saw
something you didn't like your reaction
in like high school was like gay now as
South Park brilliantly points out that
doesn't mean that like when somebody
like me was saying that that I I'm
saying hey being a homosexual is
inferior and wrong compared to
heterosexuality no it's it's something
that developed over time that became
decoupled from being hateful because you
know as far as I can remember I've been
in favor of gay marriage I've always
been in favor of gay marriage but that
doesn't mean that I haven't at time
miss injest said gay or you know at
times you say your friend you you would
say to your friend [ __ ] like if you
want to have an impact and hit him like
yeah [ __ ]
now again would I do that now probably
not no I wouldn't talk in that way but I
I would vehemently disagree with the
idea that when I said those things that
that's me being anti-gay because it's
simply not you can say those things and
be you know not politically correct but
at the same time you're not saying what
people insist you're saying so in other
words people would hear me saying
something like that or read me saying
something like that and go oh Kyle
hates gay people and he's anti gay but
that's factually not true I'm in favor
of gay marriage I've always fought for
gay rights but at the same time I also
don't bite my tongue and I was an
awkward young white boy who said ni GGA
- does that mean I'm racist no it's just
so in other words I don't care about
what she said back then some of it I'm
sure was genuinely anti-gay because she
was against gay marriage so there's
really not a comparison between me who's
always been for gay marriage but some of
it I'm sure was joke some of it was
genuinely anti-gay but even if it was
all genuinely anti-gay I don't care
because now she's Pro gay so she changed
her mind and now she's in favor of gay
people so she came to the right position
so all her hold her long spiel here
about talking about all the hate against
gay people yeah yeah yeah yeah we all
agree we all agree we know you're not
anti-gay anymore we know you're on the
right side of that issue now but you're
talking the entire time the real
elephant in the room the real issue was
not what you said it's the fact that
your giant disgusting brazen lie to
cover it up and then now you have every
MSNBC host including Rachel Maddow
talking about how I've never been more
proud to work with joy and read than I
am right now all these you know
corporate Democrat types establishment
Democrat types are rushing in to defend
her the daily coasts uh the the guy who
came up with daily Coast Markos Meletis
or whatever the [ __ ] his name is he's
like I'm with joy I read that there's no
question
okay well then here's the thing guys if
somebody who's supposed to give us the
news give us information data facts and
portrays themselves as a truth teller if
she tells a giant lie like this and
that's what it is a giant lie and you're
cool with it I don't want to hear
another [ __ ] word about fake news
from you guys ever again because what
happened here's an MSNBC host spread a
story that is just preposterous lis fake
to cover her own ass and you are like
yeah I'm fine with that because I like
her okay well then stop pretending
you're against fake news you're for fake
news as long as you like
the people it's in service of so as long
as you're doing fake news to side with
Democratic establishment politicians or
hack Democratic loyalists pundits well
then you're fine with it
so I want to be crystal clear about what
my take on this is I again I don't care
less I couldn't care less about what she
actually said back then because even if
she was genuinely anti-gay and it looks
like she was because she was against gay
marriage so that's anti-gay by
definition
she's now for gay rights so a total and
utter pass on whatever she said on those
issues back then in other words if
you're harping away on that aspect of
the story
get over yourself everybody's had shitty
opinions at one point or another or said
things that are not politically correct
or whatever the case so don't harp away
on that because there's there's no there
there on that front she's on the right
side now and that's why everybody the
entire gay community is like virtually
the entire gay community you can't speak
for all of them of course but there are
many like she just went to a panel of
like for gay people to back her up after
she did this rant here so most people
are like yeah we forgive you for that
there's no problem Glenn Greenwald
brilliant guy he as a gay man was like
yeah I don't care that part of it we
evolve we move we met over it where
everybody's fine with that everybody has
opinions and they evolve and they change
but again his point was
but she told a disgusting lie in the
service of covering up what she said and
Jimmy door has a good theory on this he
says that he thinks after the last
incident where there was the anti-gay
stuff found and she apologized for it
she had meeting with MSNBC executives
and the executives we're like is there
anything else like we'll get past this
one we could work through this one but
is there anything else on that block and
she was like no and then when this came
out she was like yeah I [ __ ] they're
gonna fire me if I admit to this one I
did I was hacked so I think that's a
brilliant theory from Jimmy I think that
probably has something to do with it but
again either way the the stuff she said
we can all get past that's fine she's
she's on the right side on those issues
today but just never again if you can't
look at Joanne Reid as a source of truth
as a source of you know news honest
opinions because we know at the end of
the day she's a liar
and she'd spread fake news in an instant
to cover her own ass and then that calls
it a question everything else she's ever
said and and listen this is illuminating
because joy and reads of somebody who
repeatedly went after Edward Snowden you
know used to go after Chelsea Manning
all the [ __ ] time is squarely in the
hillary campo ver bernie sanders and
regularly smears bernie bros and is
totally unscrupulous so she really is a
hack of epic proportions and this is
such a great example of it where she
tell the most insane lie to cover for
for herself and then when people point
out whoa whoa whoa the issue here is the
lie that you told after the fact what
does she do she shrouds her self in I've
grown and I've evolved past those
opinions that I had and we need to talk
about this because it shows how
marginalized communities really are
marginalized so in other words it's like
let me take this instance of me being a
total liar and a fraud and instead of
acknowledging that and accepting the
consequences for it
redirect the conversation up
skate and act like no this is about the
bad opinions I had and now we're past
that now I'm a fighter for the on the
right side of this issue again nobody's
harping away on that point aspect of it
or very few people are most people are
saying no the problem was to cover up
and the brazen lie and now you're gonna
have the nerve to go out on your show
over the next few weeks and talk about
fake news and call out Donald Trump well
you don't have a [ __ ] leg to stand on
when when you say [ __ ] like this and
MSNBC shame on them they have no shame
none whatsoever
I mean look at Genki ogre called out the
corruption the Democratic Party he's no
he no longer works there Phil Donahue
was against the Iraq war he no longer
works there because they wanted a
totally pro war Network at the time
because that was the mood in the country
ed Schultz called out TPP and then
Schultz back to Bernie Sanders over
Hillary Clinton they tried to suppress
him from covering it and then they let
him go and fire them so this is a
network that has repeatedly proved they
don't care about the actual issues they
don't care about policy substance they
care about having a mouthpiece for the
Democratic establishment and for
corporate America and that's what Joanne
Reid is and this is such a clear example
of it because if they really cared about
fake news they would let her go because
of that not because of the shitty
opinion she had or the bad jokes she
told her whatever I total pass on that
total forgiveness for that and she's on
the right side of those issues now the
problem is that she's a goddamn liar
so we had a historic day over the
weekend in Korea president moon jae-in
of South Korea and of course kim
jeong-hoon of north korea met and
crossed the border together so it was
the first time in decades the war isn't
even officially over the Korean War
never officially ended there was a truce
but it never officially ended well now
they're gonna end the Korean War
officially so you had the South Korean
president crossed the border with Kim
jong-un into North Korea Kim jong-un
crossed the border into South Korea and
listen this is just good news for the
world because it looks like we have a
giant de-escalation here two parties
coming to the table and indeed making
peace now the details of exactly what's
gonna happen
have yet to be ironed out and you know
therein lies the the real important
story because what is Kim jong-un going
to agree to and what will the West
particularly the United States accept in
terms of kim kim jeong-hoon so in other
words are we gonna be like okay you have
nuclear weapons and there's your
deterrent so now we can all get along
that's not gonna happen or is he gonna
say yeah I'll give up nuclear weapons
but what exactly do you mean by you
giving up nuclear weapons are you really
gonna give up your nuclear weapons fully
and completely so that you have no
deterrent anymore so I don't think
that's gonna happen he might say yeah
that's what I'm gonna do but I don't
think that's what he's gonna do and
we'll have more on this not only in this
story but stories we're gonna do later
on on the show but listen no matter how
you slice it or dice it this is
wonderful news North Korea and South
Korea you know sat down at the table
literally spoke to each other and as you
could tell by this picture it went
pretty goddamn well so let's take a look
at a short news clip on this
it has been a day full of extraordinary
moments and images and it started with
this one the supreme leader of North
Korea walking across the dividing line
into the South Kim jong-un then grabbed
the hand of South Korean president moon
jae-in and together they stepped back
for a moment onto North Korean soil as
their summit meeting began they sat
across a table exactly 2018 millimeters
wide the backdrop a huge painting of a
famous North Korean mountain range
immediately president moon set the tone
telling Kim jong-un he had been brave to
make the journey south as the day rolled
on more extraordinary images have
continued Kim's limousine scooting back
and forth across the dividing line his
personal bodyguards running alongside
the two leaders planting a tree with
soil and water brought from the north
and the south but perhaps the most
fascinating moment of all was their
afternoon stroll sitting for nearly half
an hour on a bridge sipping tea deep in
what appears to have been animated
conversation it is a massive contrast to
what started with one of the most brutal
Wars of the 20th century in 1953 a truce
was signed at exactly the same place the
two leaders met today but the conflict
has never ended just a few months ago it
really looked like military conflict
might break out again as Kim jong-un
launched ever more powerful missiles and
tested ever-larger nuclear devices today
just four months later the two leaders
emerge from their summit to declare
their intention to end the conflict
permanently there will be no Korean War
a new era of peace will open we've
suffered so much but now we stand
together mr. Kim and I agree to have the
Korean Peninsula without any nuclear
arsenal we cannot be separated we are
one nation when we met we realized we
cannot be parted we
our one nation it has been a truly
remarkable day here in South Korea and a
brilliant piece of political theater by
president moon and Kim jong-un and it
may be the beginning of something really
different but it's worth remembering
that this railway bridge behind me here
between the South here and the north
over there was reopened in the early
2000s to great fanfare there was even
talk of trains running from Seoul all
the way to Europe and it never happened
the path is now open to the much bigger
prize a face-to-face meeting between Kim
jong-un and US president Donald Trump
that could now happen within weeks and
it will be an even more extraordinary
moment we between field Hayes BBC news
on the North South Korea border so the
backstory to what happened here is that
president Park of South Korea the former
president was impeached over corruption
we covered that story not that long ago
and president moon jae-in is the
pro-peace candidate and he had the
overwhelming support of South Koreans
there's been a giant grassroots movement
many activists in South Korea have been
pushing for peace aggressively now this
is all good news here's the part that
I'm skeptical of take a look at this
headline kim jeong-hoon
promises to give up nuclear weapons if
u.s. vows not to invade now nuclear
experts have been weighing in on this in
fact one of them spoke to the intercept
in a very interesting article and the
nuclear experts are saying yeah no so
what kim jeong-hoon means by we're gonna
do denuclearization is very different
from the perception of what hardliners
want it to mean so john bolton gave an
interview the other week and he said
yeah sure do realization is great Kim
who needs to tell us where we bring our
ships in and where we land our planes
and then we'll take all of his nuclear
weapons out of the country and be done
with them bring him to Tennessee and the
nuclear experts are like no no see when
he talks about denuclearization
well he might mean hey I'll give up my
ability to do to do long-range strikes
so in other words I'll keep my nuclear
weapons but don't worry I don't have the
long-range capability so it it won't be
a threat against the United States
another thing is hey I'll stop run I'll
stop doing nuclear tests now some
experts say what he's doing here is a
power play Kim jong-un because the
argument or or the the front he's trying
to put on is up that's it I got all I
told I'm totally nuclear I'm totally
capable I have all the nuclear
capabilities that I'd ever need and so
now I just want everybody to know um ago
she ating from a position of strength so
I'm gonna come to the table and let you
guys know hey since I now have a
deterrent to Western aggression and to
whatever South Korea wants to do to us
so I just want you to know I'm totally
secure and I got everything on lock here
so let's make a show of you know of
solidarity and of peace and then that's
supposed to send the message of
confidence to the world okay well I see
acting peaceful well maybe he's acting
peaceful because he's trying to portray
I already have the weapons that I need
now the nuclei experts say he actually
probably doesn't because the number of
nuclear tests he's done are not enough
to indicate he's successfully come up
with whatever the long-range technology
is in order to to nuke a place like the
United States for example so there's a
bunch of different things that could be
going on here now again at the end of
the day I think this is it's still
fantastic news I believe that to Mike or
anybody who's you know trying to act
like
possible alternative is is better than
this I think they're dead wrong and the
president of South Korea has been using
again what the experts call strategic
flattery of the US so I mean this guy is
brilliant and he you know they often
talk about oh you want a leader who
plays chess not checkers or whatever
they say three-dimensional chess or
whatever the [ __ ] and that's kind of
what the president of South Korea is
doing because as he's been you know
working for peace with North Korea what
he's done is they said stroked the ego
of Donald Trump and anytime they do
something positive that's a step towards
peace he basically pawns off all of it
to Trump and says Oh Donald Trump you're
the reason why this is really happening
we want to thank you for all the
wonderful work that you're doing
it's because of you that Kim Jong moon
is really stepping up here and and
coming to the table for peace and then
Trump like he was doing a rally the
other day and in the rally he said
repeatedly you know it just has
everything to do with me it's got
absolutely everything to do with me even
the president South Korea says it even
the president of South Korea says it so
this is strategic flattery stroking his
ego so that he can take credit for peace
but again the big the big test is gonna
be if indeed it happens the meeting
between Kim jong-un and Donald Trump so
so kim jeong-hoon met with Pompeo
already and he's supposed to meet with
donald trump in the near future and
here's the thing we want Donald Trump to
have a giant ego going into this and and
care most about how this looks to
everybody else because when you sit down
at the table with kim jeong-hoon
and if you're if your only position is
the john bolton position which is total
and complete denuclearization we're
going to come on we're going to take all
your weapons and that's going to be
under it well that's something kim
jeong-hoon
ultimately is not going to agree to now
he will make concessions so again he
might say I won't do any more tests
are done so you get to go save face to
the press and to your country and say
look what see he's not doing nuclear
tests anymore what does that show maybe
it shows he doesn't have nuclear weapons
or kim jongwan might say yeah no we're
gonna know more long-range technology or
he might say hey we have one facility
you can come in and shut down and take
it away and then you go to your people
and say see we got what we wanted so
there are gonna be real concessions on
Kim Jong Un's part but listen and here's
the part of the story nobody's gonna
tell you if Kim Jong Un's says I'm gonna
give away all my nuclear weapons and
that's it he's lying
because he's not gonna do that and the
second point is if he did do that he's
the biggest idiot on the planet and I
say that because not because Kim Jong
Un's a good guy or I want him to do you
know to do that no not at all
I say that because he saw what happened
to Saddam Hussein he saw what happened
to Gaddafi which is the more important
example where the Gaddafi gave up his
weapons to the US and as a show of hey
don't invade me here I'll do what you
want if as long as you don't topple me
and then immediately the u.s. toppled
years later they topple them so what
that showed that example showed is you
can't trust the US if the US says hey
just give up your weapons and everything
will be fine
I almost fell out of my chair because
what they've demonstrated is no if you
give up your weapons they're just gonna
use that as fuel to say well now we know
we could topple him because he can't
attack us so or you know I mean I guess
there's a small chance he gives up all
of his nukes but he would never give up
his conventional weapons because he has
plenty of conventional weapons and he
wants to keep those again as a deterrent
pointed at South Korea so that we know
if the US does anything to him he can
launch on South Korea or if South Korea
does anything to him he can launch on
South Korea he's got a lot of keep
weapons as a deterrent to Western
aggression because again the West shows
all the time well we don't stop at
anything to get regime change at the
places we want [ __ ] regime change
Gaddafi is the perfect example thank you
for giving up your weapons now we're
gonna topple you so
the lesson from that is okay
don't come up your weapons don't give it
up and in fact people their military
leaders in the US are like yeah you know
they might not say other people might
not admit this publicly politicians
might not admit this publicly but he
wants those weapons as a deterrent
because we'll come up with some reason
and go invade him and topple him if he
doesn't have the weapons so I'm
skeptical when they say oh he promises
to give up nuclear weapons if the US
vows not to invade however even given
all those facts I just told you and the
different directions this can go in it's
still good news because if so let's say
they have the meeting if Donald Trump is
just willing to accept a big a big
concession from kim jeong-hoon like no
more tests or no more long-range
technology or here one facility will
shut down if he's willing to accept that
well then Trump can go back here and say
I did it
amazing tremendous peace he's already
taking credit for it but he could really
take credit and say that's it we made a
peace deal unbelievable it worked out we
no need to worry about this issue
anymore and that would actually be a
good thing and then you might have some
idiots here in the US who say no but he
still has some nukes err he still has
some military capabilities so that's not
a win but it would it would still be a
win because again what you're seeing
here is despite everything else he
doesn't he's not gonna offensively
attack people he doesn't he knows what
would happen to him if he were to attack
the US or to attack South Korea so we
know as a matter of fact he's no
offensive threat now he's a menace
against his own people there's no doubt
about that he's done horrible things
he's a brutal dictator all that can be
true but it's also true he's no threat
to South Korea no offensive threat to
South Korea or the u.s. but listen in
this instance the bulk of the credit
without a doubt goes to the activists in
South Korea the people at North Korea
who wanted peace and moon jae-in the
president of South Korea who is a peace
candidate that's where the bulk of the
credit goes and we just have to hope
that
Trump cares more about his ego and how
things are perceived then you know the
position of the neo cons because the neo
cons are gonna be pushing him in fact
John Bolton just said it oh we should do
the Libya model with with North Korea
why not just tell them hey if you give
up your weapons we're just gonna top you
because that's what that is that's
exactly what that is
so Trump needs to be able to fend off
Pompeyo and John Bolton and all the
idiot neo cons in his administration and
say no [ __ ] off you're wrong and then
say save face and say I made peace even
though he's not responsible and we're
all gonna know he's not primarily
responsible for peace but if he can just
passively accept whatever concessions
and pretend like it's the perfect deal
I'll take it I'll [ __ ] take it and
listen the thing for me is I consider on
the issue of North Korea I consider any
administration a success where there's
no hot war because the US has been
wanting regime change in North Korea
forever and so any administration that
doesn't attack North Korea fine I'll
take it and I'll consider you a success
on that issue so all Donald Trump needs
to do is not attack them and I'll say
good enough Thank You Donald good job
but if it were were to go a little
further than that and he would have just
accept that North Korea and South Korea
came to terms that'd be even better just
accept whatever concessions kim
jeong-hoon gives I'm relatively certain
that the new South Korean president is
going to accept whatever you know token
concessions kim jeong-hoon gives because
he's a peace guy and i think he knows
that he's not an offensive threat so if
they're gonna accept the concessions the
US needs to accept the concessions and
you just got to hope that Donald Trump
wants to save face more than he wants to
listen to all the neo cons in his
administration so this is a great story
no matter how you slice it or dice it
it's definitely more complicated than
the media is letting on because again
they framed it as oh kim jeong-hoon is
just promising to give up his weapons
i'm sure the details are a lot more
murky than that and there are gonna be
back there is gonna be back and forth
and we just have to hope that trumps
idiocy doesn't blow this up because
there's a chance that when he sits down
with Kim
he's like okay we're gonna take all your
weapons right and that's when kim
jongguk oh no I want peace but here
here's what I'm offering and then you
know the US could say all right that
works here's what we'll offer in return
relief of sanctions and stuff like that
so we just have to we have to wait and
see but there's a decent chance that at
the end of all this I'll say good enough
and as long as Trump sits passively by
while the north and the south make peace
fine fine fine fine that'd be a good a
good scenario a bad scenario would be
you know trumps blindsided by the fact
that Kim Jong Un's not gonna give up
100% of what you know the US wants and
then he's acts like offended and says no
that's we're now we're gonna get tough
we're gonna get tough on them that would
be a disaster because let the north in
the south take the lead on this because
they actually want peace u.s. should
just accept whatever terms they come to
and the terms I'm sure will make sense
to one extent or another and that's good
enough for me
hello everybody what up you know how
sometimes when we start I go
welcome to the tango it's any because I
don't even like like that song or know
any other lyrics other than welcome to
the jungle annex and we got fun in games
I think I was just about to say that's
the next line that I know we've got fun
and games yeah but I don't even know
that's like I don't even know it well I
don't even like it but I just it just
like comes in my head every time we
start yeah I was on so I drove back to
New York this past weekend I think on
Thursday and we're going upstate and
it's a time where like you lose all the
radio stations that you like and I don't
like serious anything like that so I
discovered in the Mazda if you hit like
you could hit the Scan button and it
scans till it finds us it like a station
that's good and working mm-hmm and it
plays it for about like I don't know
second or two and you could stop it if
you want or that goes to the next
station that please so I was like
scanning through and all these like old
ass songs we were on and I'm like I
would occasionally stop it on some old
like that on a t-shirt and one of them
was like nausea Osbourne song and
there's like one of his famous ones is
like something about mother or something
like that yeah I think so oh so I was
like listening to the song and I wanted
to like it just cuz it was like a good
connection and sometimes it's like hard
to find a radio station when you're
driving do like the middle of
Cleveland's here like if I change his
[ __ ] ain't gonna find some [ __ ] for a
minute yeah so I was like listening to
it and then I like saw that it was Ozzy
Osbourne and I was like this song's not
that good yeah and I was sort of mad
just because like Ozzy Osbourne's a god
but it's so that Schilling she like that
is so generational man yeah I wonder too
like what song was it I was in the car
with my mom recently and um I forget the
it was like some 1980s hair band rock
[ __ ] that was all my history like that
almost like his is gonna bother me that
I'm not gonna be able to remember it
but it was like it sounded funny to me
it's not even that I didn't like it I
mean I didn't like it but it's also that
on top of just not liking it like it
almost sounded like they were trying to
be a parody of what they thought a
hairband would sound like type [ __ ]
what's a hairband like that you know
you've never seen those pictures of
dudes with the [ __ ] oh it's crazy
[ __ ] yeah awfully long yeah like that
like it was like it in like the 1980s
they had bands like that and they all it
was just a different time like one of
the stations was like when I used to do
road trips with my dad and my brother
and sister down to Florida um he would
have these old cassettes of like sixties
music or some [ __ ] and so I knew like
all like Dion and like old school like
old school [ __ ] um and so one of the
stations had the old school bangers and
they were playing it and the lyrics to
one of the songs was literally like
she's like she was 17 she was my prom
queen like I was like it was on some
listening to the lyrics it was like this
this shit's a little weird and then like
the radio duct like DJ guy came on after
and was just like all right that was
Johnny playing these in the wing told me
if this [ __ ] was mainstream media like
or like today's this dude would be like
brought up on charges for like OD
pedophile [ __ ] yeah they did a list
recently I forget where the list was on
some website of like songs that wouldn't
fly today and like you know it was [ __ ]
like that like singing about [ __ ] 17
year old or whatever the case it was bad
it was like the dude was like yeah she
looks so good and she's 17 and I can't
wait and I'm like yeah yeah this song
doesn't seem right but I was saying
along to a jammin cruisin well yeah cuz
the you can make something sound good
that and the lyrics could be bad like
there was an old commercial of like a
Swedish family or something not Swedish
some some foreign ass family sits in a
car and they don't speak English
and on the radio is a song that sounds
like a pop song but in their exact I
wanna [ __ ] you in the ass and then they
just keep repeating like that that was
the
it was a commercial people is probably
saw on YouTube now people could look it
up but like the family gets in there's
like a little boy and a little girl
probably like didn't bleep the whole
commercial out in their teens if they
have the uncensored version on uh online
I never saw it like on actual TV I've
only seen it online yeah and like the
family's like smiling and they like the
mother starts like bobbing her head like
yes but music is weird in general man
and don't I mean what in 30 years we'll
look back at the music we listen to
today like that [ __ ] sounded stupid and
then in another 30 years from then we'll
look at the [ __ ] from thirty years
before that and go that should sound
stupid
it's just yeah it's one of those things
that just doesn't you know stand the
test of time yeah I mean because it
changes so much mm-hmm it's hard to it
same thing with comedy it's just
changing so much speaking of music just
so weird it's weird hole in the music
thing that like I don't know any [ __ ]
Spanish at all I don't speak the
language but I could like like test
besito and like other Spanish songs that
I've heard India are like I could say
the verses like this okay and if you go
to dr and spike spain you they play some
Justin Bieber song and a person who you
can't communicate sheet with they put
that song on and they're like rapping 50
cent I'm an app just I'm like oh
speaking of that I you know I had the
same reaction not with that song use
name that's a newer one yeah but back
when one of my best friends was Jose we
would listen to remember in high school
yeah of course it's [ __ ] put kid's
head to the [ __ ] car
yeah you turned out to be a little
[ __ ] up dude didn't he but he he would
always play that song pobre Diablo yeah
that was a banger to know that [ __ ] was
hot and that it looked like back when
that she played if you had Spanish
people in the car and like you hadn't
said a word yet you hadn't said [ __ ]
we'd all sing the hook on yeah and you
sing the hook they'll be like oh you
know Spanish I can [ __ ] it and then not
really cuz anybody listening now when I
speaks but just tried to sing it they'd
be like if they translated it they'd be
like you just said you wanted a ferret
to be in your grandma's ass
like once the mute like when I sing
along to some songs and they're in like
tits in the background a little band
we've said this before when we've done
it with karaoke like in the car I'll be
singing along I'm like I sort of hit
that no I'm sorry and then like I don't
know the station will clink out or like
someone will change it oh yeah your
Bluetooth to come on and it'd be quiet
we sound terrible oh [ __ ]
well that's the thing we've spoken
others before but when it comes to
karaoke when you sing a karaoke song but
they put on the actual song behind you
you're gonna think you sound good cuz
that's not really you it's half you half
whoever the [ __ ] the actual singer is
but then like you said if they cut it
off you're like and that happens to
everybody unless they're like a legit
singer then they're gonna be singing
along and you know be like oh [ __ ] I
sound stupid but speaking of music did
you see how [ __ ] Kanye West has been
losing his mind I mean he's always going
apeshit on Twitter I mean he's already
kind of or he's always been like a
little out there but yeah he I feel like
I mean he doesn't have rules to his life
and it's just like all of a sudden he's
like a little kid and we'll just be like
I'm gonna tweet 20 million things in a
row and the [ __ ] scorpion it really is
trumpian that's the Trump [ __ ] it's just
like I'm just gonna [ __ ] have a
verbal diarrhea on Twitter well I guess
not verbal cuz it's on Twitter but he's
just like he you say more to Trump no
one can say anything to him to like you
know you'd be rational or like hey like
that's not I mean like Twitter's
whatever you could do whatever with it
but it's just like hey that's not how
Twitter works and that's the thing that
annoys me just like Trump Trump thinks
like I'm a genius like I have a very
high IQ like you know he doesn't have a
high IQ that says I have a very high IQ
somebody who doesn't have a high IQ and
you know Kanye says the same [ __ ] like
I'm a genius and a lot of people our age
are like ya know he's a genius
and then but then he does [ __ ] like this
and it's like you want to look at them
and be like are you so sure about that
whole genius thing clearly doesn't know
like what he's doing like he's tweeting
support for all these conservative you
know and pull and I honestly I would
honestly bet that he
even he didn't even necessarily really
know that the people he was tweeting
props to actually were conservative I
think he just heard whoever was say a
few things was like I like that and then
they you know we tweet support and then
it's like he doesn't realize that year
that's a kid that's a conservative
right-wing thing and you don't
understand that this comes with like a
wagonload of other beliefs yeah so it's
just like he's just and it's so funny to
see how people come to him yeah but but
people look at his [ __ ] and look up to
him and idolize him and they're gonna
start thinking like that [ __ ] crazy
lady or something like that you know
like I don't know about that because he
because a lot of it like everybody feels
like everybody had the reaction that I
would have expected everybody to have in
that all the Republicans now instantly
love Kanye West and yeah all the all the
Democrats are like yeah he's overrated
like everybody thought he was amazing
it's really not all that amazing so I
feel like everybody's reaction has been
kind of predictable but he's just it
pisses me off so much because he gets so
much attention for his tweets and so
much you know like just like publicity
off his [ __ ] where it's like anything he
does is gonna get you know blown up so
it's like he puts out these fashion
things he says he's like like a designer
and fashionable and he's like the
coulding he put out or like he's I don't
know if he's joking or not but the
picture of like the easy slides did you
see those ones blue I don't think he's
joke I'm looking things I don't think
he's joking I think it was one flip-flop
sideways that looked like a [ __ ] like
hospital shoe it was dirty and like it
and like the [ __ ] people put underneath
it was amazing you like a glass slipper
of some girl's foot that was like
disgusting and then someone put like
like a display case that was just clear
like people were hilarious boy I don't
get how like what would get him so mad
and would people don't understand is
like if he puts a tweet out don't like
his [ __ ] don't retweet it let him get
like four likes and then he'll be like
wait what the [ __ ] is what just happened
you know like no that guy
you can't deter that guy because he I
think he's I think he's a little off I
think I'm dead I'm phrasing it as nicely
as I could phrase it but he's you don't
think he got two likes on all of those
tweets he'd he'd go nuts and be like
what the [ __ ] just happened
you know like yeah but that was off that
he's like Trump and that that would make
him double down even more like all you
were wrong in this [ __ ] is great and
he's done it before I remember I just
watched a clip of like him on like Jimmy
Kimmel and he was like ranting about how
nobody would give him a fashion line or
some [ __ ] or nobody yeah like sounds
something like that and and everybody
was like feeding into his narcissism
like oh yeah oh yeah you are genius
oh obviously you are like you know you
should have been given this and it just
goes to show you he's well he's a
lunatic he's just in his own world and
like I said anyone who tries to tell him
like hey that sleeper is a little
[ __ ] like [ __ ] as ugly as [ __ ] that
[ __ ] won't sell they'd be like now I'll
get it to sell I'm a genius like
everyone's telling him is it like he
could have he could have it he literally
could have had like it looked like that
flip-flop he'd like put it in some dog
[ __ ] and like you're gonna sell it with
dog [ __ ] and someone's still gonna pay
thousands he could do anything he could
sell some underwears with actual [ __ ] in
it and like people would buy it
it'd be like that has to do Kanye's [ __ ]
on the way well that that's the thing is
like I that's what annoys me more than
Kanye himself is the people who keep
insisting that there's a there they're
like no no seriously like you don't get
because this happened a bunch of times
before this happened like he wore
Confederate flag and like posted a
picture I like Instagram or some [ __ ]
and I was like wow that's pretty [ __ ]
stupid and then people were like nah nah
nah nah see you don't get it what he's
trying to do is and it's like yeah they
start making reasons yeah exactly and
they that this [ __ ] happens all the
[ __ ] time when it's somebody who's
really famous and like really powerful
and has hit a certain level of celebrity
there becomes a you can't say [ __ ] to
them even when you're a hundred percent
right this happened with Charlie Sheen
to Charlie Sheen just [ __ ] going on
binges and [ __ ] and usually got like HIV
and [ __ ] and like if you critique him
it's everybody's like nah but that's
Charlie Sheen yeah like so [ __ ]
I don't care if he could be Charlie
Sheen and wrong about some [ __ ] yep you
know just like Kanye West can be Kanye
West but he turned he's he does really
act like Trump that's not there was some
other [ __ ] he did oh we had a meeting
with Trump right didn't he take a
meeting with Trump back when recently or
no back his day back when Trump I think
was on the campaign trail mm-hmm yeah he
like went to Trump Tower and met Trump
and then everybody started [ __ ] on
Kanye and I think he kind of back
pedaled a little bit and I was like I've
been having problems recently and I need
to go away for a little bit and like he
did and then he came back and now he's
being even dumber than ever I mean he
just looks out for himself and it's the
same way that truck like Trump has never
done anything like for someone like to
benefit you know like I think it
benefits him he's never done anything
like even his charities and all this
[ __ ] yeah JT yeah Connie what the [ __ ]
is Kanye done like oh you could you say
you put out sneakers and clothing line
but like you're selling it for forty
thousand that like you selling it for a
thousand dollars for a t-shirt some [ __ ]
that like oh that's another one he put a
t-shirt up a picture of a t-shirt that
was like it had I don't know picture of
him and his tour dates or some [ __ ] but
it was on some like $5 gilded t-shirt
like some regular ass [ __ ] and like he's
gonna sell it for $500 like so that's
why I don't know if he's joking or not
yeah he's not Chuck what who will pay
like $500 for some t-shirt that you
could get wherever like in Chinatown or
something he's just mind-boggling so I
don't I mean he's a lunatic
he gets me mad people feed into his [ __ ]
it's just like don't like his [ __ ] don't
retweet his [ __ ] make him get one
[ __ ] like and he'll be tight and then
he'll like keep going crazy and then
they'll eventually jump off a bridge or
some [ __ ] so do you think he's on he's
on like he's doing you think there's a
chance he's doing some like Andy Kaufman
type routine yeah but I
I think Andy Kaufman mighta actually
there might have been something wrong
with him like Connie is he knows what
he's doing okay I don't teach achill
with him well I don't know oh I don't
know if there was something wrong with
Andy Kaufman but I do think there's
something wrong with Kanye just in the
sense that he's off like I don't think
he's all there and I think to be fair I
think that that's partly what made him
blow up in the first place like Dave
Chappelle tells a story about when he
first met Kanye Kanye performed on one
of his shows and on the ship back on the
Chappelle show and like he said Kanye
took a phone call and I think he said
that the phone call it was somebody else
famoust who was talking to Kanye I don't
remember who that person was but he said
he heard khat he overheard Kanye say on
the phone yeah man let me call you call
you back I'm doing Dave Chappelle show
because my life is dope and I do dope
[ __ ] and then he hung up the phone and
it's like well yeah there is an aspect
of that and again same is Trump where
you elbow your way into the room because
you're so [ __ ] persistent that you
don't even understand that there's
another thing that is the opposite of
persistent like you don't understand
that like laziness and giving up is even
an option because all you do when you
get out of bed in the morning is have
this insatiable narcissistic desire
doing confidence not it's not just
confidence is one thing confidence as
kind of a positive connotation but what
I'm saying is it's this thing where
you're so narcissistic and you're such
an empty vessel that but you just all
you know how to do is just go out there
and get your name out there more and do
whatever the [ __ ] you can do in order to
get out there in the public spotlight I
mean listen again to bring Trump back
into this I know we continue to bring
him back into this but I just did a
story about how he he called in the
1980s he called Forbes and pretended to
be his own publicist yeah he it was
Donald Trump but he was like no this is
John Baron or some [ __ ] and sometimes he
called and say he's John Smith or
whatever and then he'd say he's worth
you know whatever 100 not a hundred
billion dollars what was it it was
something billion though some five
billion
yeah but right Sam billion it was only
worth like five million and the guy said
he's he was like oh I didn't believe him
I didn't put him down for five billion I
put him down for 1 billion
the reality is Corrin they figured out
at the time when you did that phone call
he was worth 5 million ok but all these
people are suckers because why don't you
call him out on his [ __ ] back then
record the [ __ ] put it in Forbes like
this guy's a wounded to show that Gators
an audio of like him being a [ __ ]
loser that gets back to the original
point which is guys like Kanye guys like
Trump they don't allow you to deny them
their pathological and it literally
might I know Trump as a pathologic a
pathological liar I don't know that
about Kanye but I do know he's also
pathological and that Trump a lie and it
looks like he almost makes himself
believe his own lies and he repeats it
over and over and over and he's got that
thing he's got that thing about him
where even though he's objectively full
of [ __ ] and you can prove it it he it
looks like he thinks he's telling the
truth you know he's got that thing on of
him that's like truthiness like yeah I'm
going to be a straight-shooter even
though he's not straight shooting and
guys like that it's hard like he they
don't get denied I told you this already
because I watched that great Netflix
so CNN ran a giant smear piece on
YouTube in what's fundamentally a
coordinated effort to try to get
advertisers to further demonetised
creators so listen um I'm usually
somebody who doesn't assume bad intent
on other people's part I like to assume
good intent and that when people talk
about stuff they sincerely believe what
they're talking about and they're doing
it you know without malice but this is
an instance where having read this
article three or four times there is no
other takeaway then this is a smear
campaign
it's a hatchet job and it's done on
purpose by CNN to try to take out what
they now recognize is a competitor in
YouTube okay so let's dive into it here
exclusive YouTube ran ads from hundreds
of brands on extremist channels so this
this is what happened with The Wall
Street Journal not that long ago this is
what led to the first ad pocalypse and
just to give you the the Cliff Notes
version of it what happens is you to
places ads via algorithms because they
don't have you can't have enough people
to place the individual ads on the
individual channels because there's so
many goddamn YouTube channels and so
many goddamn YouTube views that it's not
it's fundamentally not possible
logistically not possible to have a
human being do every single thing so
they place ads through algorithms now
every now and then something happens
where an ad will basically slip through
the cracks and get on a genuinely
hateful channel there have been examples
of mainstream ads on neo-nazi channels
or KKK or I'm sure there's on jihadist
videos or whatever the [ __ ] it's
happened it's happened now what they
don't tell you is the other you know
piece of the puzzle here which is that
the overwhelming majority of the time
that's not an issue on 99.999999 9
percent of genuinely hateful content
there are no ads there are no as
and whenever something happens to slip
through the cracks it's usually because
you know you might have uh you might
have a video where the title is not
hateful the tags are not hateful and the
thumbnail does not look hateful but
within that video anyway there might be
something that's hateful but how is how
can YouTube you know know that that
video is hateful if there's no
indication based on the preliminary
indicators that it's hateful so this
isn't a problem they're trying to make
it sound like it's a [ __ ] crisis
what's happening here and it's not
they're obviously trying to muck
something up here that's what they're
trying to do okay
they say this ads from over 300
companies and organizations including
tech giant's major retailers newspapers
and government agencies ran on YouTube
channels promoting white nationalist
Nazis pedophilia conspiracy theories and
North Korean propaganda a CNN
investigation has found they say
companies such as adidas Amazon Cisco
Facebook Hershey Hilton Linkedin Mozilla
and Netflix Nordstrom and Under Armour
may have unknowingly helped finance some
of these channels via the advertisements
they paid for on Google owned YouTube US
tax dollars may have gone to the
channels to ads from five US government
agencies such as the Department of
Transportation and Centers for Disease
Control appeared on the channels many of
the companies that responded to CNN said
they were unaware of their on they were
unaware their ads had been placed on
these channels and were investigating
how they ended up there if you're part
of a news organization first of all I
don't know why you're focusing on this
anyway there's a zillion other things in
the world that are way more important
than this but second of all they didn't
just do an investigation and then report
on it they didn't do that what they did
is they did an investigation and then
they narked they ran to youtube and then
they ran to the advertisers who are
advertising on YouTube and said hey hey
did you know that
your ads are running on neo-nazi content
and KKK content did you know that that
it's you're running on conspiracy
theories did you know that hey look I'm
just looking out for you I'm just trying
to do do the right thing by you so maybe
it's not a good idea to advertise on
YouTube when you can take those ad
dollars and maybe throw them back at CNN
if that isn't what's going on then why
would you contact the the individual
companies why would you come contact the
advertisers you wouldn't you would say
oh ah mannan I'm a journalist I'm a
reporter
it's I know it's weird I'm focusing on
this issue anyway but nonetheless here I
go I'm focusing on this issue and you
would just report on it but no they what
they did is they scoured the internet
from top to bottom to find the fringe
examples of ads getting on genuinely
hateful content and they went off this
is a huge problem oh my god this is a
systemic crisis anyway call the
advertisers and tell them hey it doesn't
look like it's safe to advertise on
YouTube maybe you should put that ad
money somewhere else that is exactly
what's happening here there's no other
possible explanation because we've
already had these hit jobs in the past
and by the way the real problem which
they'd never talk about because we're
their competition fundamentally when I
say we I mean youtubers the real problem
is the opposite the problem is these
dumbass algorithms are too strict and
what they do is take any video that
mentions Syria any video that mentions
Israel any video that mentions Saudi
Arabia and all we do on secular talk is
discuss controversial topics and I
always have to try to skirt the
algorithms by putting in weird letters
and [ __ ] because I know that certain
things just by virtue of the fact that
you know your title has certain you know
words in them you're gonna get screwed
even if your position is not hateful
they go but you're discussing a topic
where it is possible for somebody to be
on the hateful side of that topic
therefore demonetized so the real
problem is that you have honest actors
who are doing good work and
they're getting demonetised and they
shouldn't be that's the real problem
that story why because if you were on
that story what's the what's the
conclusion what's the solution
the solution is the advertisers go oh
[ __ ]
we should actually spend more money on
YouTube because that's where the [ __ ]
audience is especially in the key
demographic and these poor people are
getting a lot of views and they're not
they're not monetized because of a
shitty algorithm weird how they didn't
run that story they ran the story of oh
clutch your pearls there's a few
instances even though 99.999999 percent
of the time there are no ads on hateful
content I found a few examples of ads on
hateful content therefore let me run for
the advertisers until hey what are you
doing hey I think what maybe you should
redirect that that ad money and put it
in a trusted outlet like CNN now there's
another angle to the absurdity here to
CNN has pushed for every single war in
the modern era we just saw not that long
ago Wolf Blitzer on air when Rand Paul
brought up to Wolf Blitzer that hey
maybe we should stop selling weapons to
Saudi Arabia because they're being used
in the massacre of women and children
and a genocide in Yemen wolf Blitzer's
response was what about the profits of
the defense contractors you want to talk
about genuinely hateful content you want
to talk about calling for violence well
there's a pretty clear example of it
what about when Fareed Zakaria called
Donald Trump presidential when he
decided to bomb the [ __ ] out of Syria so
we have a direct escalation with another
nuclear-armed power Russia because Syria
is their top ally and you had everybody
on seeing a cheerleader yeah yeah oh my
goodness
what about on MSNBC when Brian Williams
talked about the beauty of our weapons
taking off they show the the missiles
taking off at night they don't show them
landing cuz when they land they might
mask her some civilians but hey whatever
don't pay attention to that look at the
beauty of our missiles taking off what
about the fact that CNN was part of the
build-up to the war in Iraq where they
said Saddam has WMDs oh my goodness we
need to go do an offensive war against
the country that didn't attack us so
they cheerleaded for a war that
minimum 200,000 civilians brought about
torture brought about NSA spying right
now we're bombing 8 different countries
and I've run through the advertisers and
got listen man these guys are [ __ ]
war mongers there for every single war
they sanitize them like nobody's
business
they cheerlead him every step of the way
can I go to CNN and say oh my goodness I
don't know why advertisers are working
with you here let me tell them and they
need to flee from you because you're not
safe no we don't do that so and by the
way they peddle in conspiracy theories a
hell of a lot more than outlets like
mine do that's for damn sure
we don't push conspiracy theories they
do push conspiracy theories but they're
only calling for the demonization of
which one US youtubers so here's where
we really take a dark turn in this piece
listen to this this is what they say
meanwhile ads from the Washington Post
in new york times appeared on far-right
conspiracy channels like black pigeon
speaks and some run by Infowars
the companies are investigating how
their ads appeared on the channels it
appears that YouTube did not follow its
own protocols and categorize these
videos properly the New York Times told
CNN the paper said its ads should only
appear on a list of pre-approved sites
if the channels are monetized which
Infowars has previously claimed they are
the major newspapers could have
unknowingly supported disinformation and
conspiracy ads also appeared on the
Jimmy Dore Show channel a far-left
YouTube channel that pedals in
conspiracy theories such as the idea
that Syrian chemical weapons attacks are
hoaxes you do know CNN that we bombed
before there was an investigation right
in fact the day after we bombed is the
day that the OPCW investigators were
supposed to go to the site so how is
jimmy dore a conspiracy theorist when he
goes he didn't use the word hoax by the
way so you're lying that's what that is
that's a lie
he never said the word hoax but what he
did say is hey the investigators are
supposed to come the day after you
bombing before there's even an
investigation why'd you hey that seems a
lot like what happened in Iraq you're
like I as WMDs and anyway let you let's
go here Colin Powell holding up a
[ __ ] thing of yellowcake at the UN
go rush to war now by the way since then
we've learned cuz other outlets are
reporting it's certainly not Western
Alice but other outlets are reporting it
the evidence we have right now is that
that indeed was not a chemical weapons
facility that we bombed it was a [ __ ]
medical facility where they made snake
venom we really made anti-venom for
snake bites that's not me speaking we
I've showed you the article you can look
through it yourself
okay so who's really the conspiracy
theorist you guys take the State
Department's propaganda and run it
mindlessly by the way that's that's like
what that's exactly what you guys accuse
RT of doing oh my god doing propaganda
for the Russian government mindlessly Oh
nobody should trust our team what about
you CNN you mindlessly parrot whatever
the [ __ ] the State Department and the
Trump administration tells you somebody
like Jimmy Dore comes along shows a
minimal amount of skepticism simply by
saying hey I don't I don't think the
word of the State Department is gospel I
don't think the word of Donald [ __ ]
Trump is gospel so maybe we wait for
evidence maybe we do an investigation Oh
conspiracy theorist you are Jimmy Dore
you're a conspiracy theorist sir by the
way again minimal amount of skepticism
who puts a chemical weapons facility in
the middle of their capital city who
does that and if it were a chemical
weapons facility when when they bombed
it that's it you can't be anywhere near
that site you can't be anywhere near
that site because obviously you're gonna
have the remnants of the chemical
weapons in the air people gonna get sick
but of course people were in the site
afterwards and all foreign media outlets
are reporting that not in the West
because you guys are doing propaganda
for the State Department in the Trump
administration but all their media
outlets are reporting it so Jimmy Dore
is actually doing the job on this issue
the journalists are supposed to do CNN
one of the more
respected news outlets in smearing him
for showing a minimal amount of
skepticism and then the further irony of
it is jimmy dore on his show on a daily
basis you know what he calls for higher
wages and no war he's against a war so
the guy who routinely is calling for
peace is routinely calling for people to
get better wages and have more
fulfilling lives because jimmy
recognizes the system is screwing
working people that god gets smeared as
quote an extremist you're the [ __ ]
extremists you're the extremists
you know it's extreme when you don't
openly reject and fight against war and
hold the people in power accountable
when you're supposed to be one of most
respected news organizations in the
goddamn country that's extremist
that's extremist that you're in lockstep
with the [ __ ] criminal government
what about george w bush and his [ __ ]
offensive war in iraq and the torture
akwonton MoBay the mainstream media
refused to call torture torture they
called it enhanced interrogation because
the Bush administration wanted them to
call it enhanced interrogation and CNN
has the nerve to call a [ __ ] straight
shooter and extremists but make no
mistake about it this isn't an error
it's not like whoops sorry we didn't do
our [ __ ] research they know what
Jimmy Dore is they want to smear him
they want to smear him they want to
compare him to literal Nazis because
guess what now guys like Jimmy Dore ooh
they're competition hmm you see all the
views that that guys getting Wow his
shows getting really popular now isn't
it I mean what are we gonna do
we can't genuinely compete and get the
key demographic sorry we we don't have
the ability with [ __ ] hosts like
Anderson Cooper and Wolf Blitzer and Don
Lemon who have the personality of
watching paint dry you have these boring
people who never said an interesting
thing in their lives and they just
repeat whatever is on the [ __ ]
prompter like Ron Burgundy and they
don't hold people in power accountable
and they don't do their jobs well how
how are you gonna compete with a guy
who's a straight shooter and is
passionate and cares about these issues
and gives people a fat
and then gives his opinion on the issues
hey you can't compete with that what do
they do [ __ ] it's not a fair fight we'll
just use all of our resources and we
have endless resources we'll use that to
run a smear article do a hatchet job and
try to get them fully demonetised
and the sad thing is guys it's working
I'm not saying it's working and that you
guys are looking at CNN and going oh
they nailed it no it's working in their
intended consequence their intended
consequences Hey
cut off their funding men that's what
the original you know ad pocalypse was
and for those of you some of you might
think like oh the ad pocalypse it ended
it never ended there was a bounce back
but then you know it it tapered off so
what happened was shows like mine shows
like David Pakman we were on a blacklist
where we made no money for a while
because just all the ads were taken away
from news and politics as a result of
you know I think it was the Wall Street
Journal's investigation where they found
some ads on some hateful content and
YouTube said throw the baby out with the
bathwater do you monetize all in news
and politics but then what happened is
after a few weeks we were romana ties
but we're in a permanent lower tier now
I know this is the case for me I know
this is the case with many other
political youtubers because I've had
conversations with them and basically
the same things going on with them what
happened was basically a maybe a 50%
bounce back so we were doing really well
they took away all of our funding and
then when they put the ads back on it
was maybe 50% bounce back now when I
look at articles like this you know what
they're trying to do right they want
they want fully full D monetization of
news and politics that's exactly what
they want again if they didn't want that
then they wouldn't have gone to the
advertisers and narked and said hey did
you know that one of your ads ran on a
neo-nazi Channel maybe you should stop
advertising with YouTube totally so
that's what this is they view us as a
competitor so they take the fringe
examples of genuinely hateful content
they tell the advertisers you're getting
on the genuinely hateful content so hey
why are you advertising with YouTube at
all if you can't trust where they're
placing all your ads that's what this is
guys that's what this is but but they
didn't account for everything here why
because here's what they don't realize a
guy like Wolf Blitzer is a boring piece
of [ __ ]
stale [ __ ] and you pulled Wolf
Blitzer on YouTube in a genuine free
marketplace where he asked to garner
views that aren't just given him by
virtue of the fact he's coasting on name
recognition from the [ __ ] 1980s he
would sink so quickly so a guy like Wolf
Blitzer if you defund him with
advertisers
well he's [ __ ] there's no way around
that but a guy like Jimmy Dore a guy
like Tim black you know shows like the
humanist report shows like secular talk
or the rational National you know you go
down the list of all these outlets what
they can't account for is that where the
Bernie Sanders to their Hillary Clinton
so Hillary's the fundraising juggernaut
name recognition coasting off the big
name and selling out daily to Wall
Street and for-profit health insurance
companies and military the
military-industrial complex well we come
along and we go listen do we hate it
that you jack our ad revenue yes all of
us do because it's enough it's nefarious
and you're doing smear jobs but because
of patreon you guys basically have swept
in and saved us it doesn't matter that
the entire audience is saying hey [ __ ]
you CNN that's a [ __ ] article
they're smearing on purpose it doesn't
matter that people said that's the last
time when the Wall Street Journal did it
and when other a listed it doesn't
matter you tube its corporate now I mean
it's fully corporate so those bigwigs
are totally out of touch with the
audience totally out of touch with
reality and what will happen is they'll
panic the advertisers will panic and go
oh people are gonna think that coca-cola
is genuinely Pro KKK and they'll flee
again and and it's gonna be the up and
so here's a big story that broke a few
days ago that frankly I've been chomping
at the bit to get on air and talk about
CNBC says democratic party files lawsuit
alleging Russia
the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks
conspired to disrupt the 2016 election
the Democratic National Committee sued
the Trump campaign the Russian
government WikiLeaks on Friday accusing
them of conspiring to disrupt the 2016
presidential election President Donald
Trump's son Donald Trump jr. and
son-in-law Jared Kushner are among the
defendants the DNC says Russia found a
willing and active partner in the Trump
campaign to attack American democracy
and defeat Hillary Clinton now Tom Perez
went on Chris Hayes show to go into
detail about exactly what's going on
here let's take a look and then we'll
come back and break it down
Pelosi weren't alerted about the lawsuit
until the DNC was about to file Tom
Perez the chairman of the Democratic
National Committee and he joins me now
chairman why now why now three reasons
Chris number one we don't know how long
the criminal proceedings will take and
nor do we want to rush that and so we
have to file in order to preserve our
rights under the civil justice system
statute of limitations things of that
nature so we have that legal imperative
number two over the course of the last
year I've done my homework a year ago it
was clear to me that the Russians had
hacked the DNC and they did it with the
purpose of helping Donald Trump and
hurting the Democrats but we didn't have
the evidence a year ago
connecting the Russians and the Trump
campaign we have that evidence now and
that's why we move forward and thirdly
Chris I'm worried about the 2018
elections there is no accountability for
what the Russians did and when they do
things with impunity because this
administration won't hold them
accountable we've got to hold them
accountable that's what the civil
justice system is about it's about
accountability it's about deterrence our
democracy is on fire and we have to
preserve our democracy we've got to
preserve full and fair elections and
that's a big part of what this is about
but
but the entities aren't gonna be held
accountable before the 2018 midterms
right I mean I've been around civil
litigation a little bit and boy does
that take a while well absolutely we
won't finish the case before now but we
want to send a very very clear signal if
you want to mess with elections here
there are going to be consequences we
are raising the cost of your
interference we know that this
administration is Putin's poodle and so
they're not going to do anything so we
will continue to act if you want to do
that if you're gonna punch us quite
frankly Chris we're gonna punch back and
that's what this lawsuit is about we are
protecting our democracy when you go
after the right to vote when you go
after the institution of Elections that
is the essence of our democracy so this
wasn't simply an attack on the DNC this
was an attack on our democracy just a
few of the reactions from some of the
people that are named here Roger stone
says it's bogus it's meritless and
baseless based on conjecture speculation
supposition some lawyers will have to be
sanctioned for wasting the Court's time
the Trump campaign says the Trump
campaign will be prepared to leverage
the discovery process explore the DNC's
now secret records about the actual
corruption they perpetrated and of
course the president tweeting that the
it's good news it will now counter for
the DNC server that they refused to give
to the FBI and then he said the wendy
Wasserman Schultz servers I think then
later corrected to debbie Wasserman
Schultz document held by the Pakistani
mystery man and Clinton emails what the
the people you've sued have gotten your
attention I guess well I mean I saw that
response and it was kind of a greatest
hits of all their wild conspiracy
theories and here's the thing for me
Chris I spent 12 years or so at the
Justice Department they were some of the
best years of my professional life I
worked as a career prosecutor under
Republican and Democratic
administrations I believe in the civil
justice system this case now goes before
an article 3 judge it's not trial by
Twitter it's trial in a court of law
where fake news and the things that
they're talking about that are just so
unfactored what they're saying
what they're saying and I want you to be
clear listen they're saying is this is
fundamentally a political messaging
document it is not a serious lawsuit
well I'll tell you Chris this is not
about partisanship it's about patriotism
and I'll tell you one other thing when
the lawsuit was filed by the DNC against
the Nixon campaign that was the exact
response of the Nixon campaign and John
Mitchell and and other folks who later
became convicted felons and we saw what
happened in Watergate and we will see
what will happen here 1972
shortly after break-in DNC files a
lawsuit settlement on the day that Nixon
leaks leaves offices I'm mistaken I'm
finally I'm Senator Claire McCaskill
who's in one of the most contested races
in the entire country in Missouri of
course she called this lawsuit a silly
distraction and I wonder if you view
your response to that well we can walk
and chew gum I love senator McCaskill
we've invested in her race we're going
to continue to invest in her race
because she's a great senator but I'll
tell you I disagree for the simple
reason that our democracy is at risk
here we have to make sure that the
elections coming up in November are fair
and they they invaded us the last time
they hacked the DNC they tried to
influence the outcome of the election
there's no accountability in the white
house and why wouldn't they do it again
indeed Tom why wouldn't people [ __ ] with
our elections again if they [ __ ] with
it in the past and they got away with it
for instance you're the head of the DNC
the DNC it's been proven that they
[ __ ] with the 2016 primary and
fundamentally rigged it in favor of
Hillary Clinton and against Bernie
Sanders now don't take my word for it go
back read all the articles go back
directly to the WikiLeaks emails and
you'll learn very quickly that you know
for example the DNC had a legal
agreement with Hillary Clinton's
campaign and they made it so that she
got final say on every press release you
couldn't make this up if you tried even
Donna Brazile who's a big-time Hillary
Clinton supporter said that when she
realized
what was actually going on when she was
the interim head of the DNC it disgusted
her and she said wow what the Bernie
Sanders supporters have been saying all
along is absolutely correct that this
was rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton
Elizabeth Warren in a moment of honesty
after we learned about the nature of
that contract between the DNC and
Hillary Clinton campaign said on a
24-hour cable news show yeah it was
rigged it's clear that it was rigged we
learned that they hid debates they
changed voting times in pro Bernie
districts they undemocratically gave her
super delegate votes before the actual
votes came in so we're talking about an
organization that was disgustingly
biased in favor of one of the two
candidates during a primary and then
they had the nerve in court to say hey
listen we didn't necessarily [ __ ] with
it but even if we did it would be legal
and totally okay so the guys who just
claimed hey not having a democratic
system is a good thing not having a
democratic system is totally a fair game
because the DNC is a private
organization so [ __ ] right off if you
don't like the way we do things that
organization is now you know giving us
crocodile tears all the sanctity of our
elections we have to preserve our
democracy quote there are going to be
consequences for messing with elections
that's what Tom Perez is saying I've
never seen a more out of touch
disgusting PR stunt in my life and
understand there's there's only a tiny
group of people who are cheering on this
silliness
because here's who you lost first of all
your entire base why because your base
are the people who are out there
fighting day in and day out for issues
that matter and that fix people's lives
fighting for Medicare for all in free
college and a living wage and ending the
wars and a new New Deal and ending the
drug war and legalizing marijuana your
base is fundamentally issues driven if
somebody's on the left and they actually
care about the issues
the base but this is what consumes their
time and this is what consumes their
thoughts what you do here is yet again
take your eye off the ball and you get
mired in conspiracy theory and you'll
get mired in extreme partisan hackery
and you're not talking about any of the
issues that really matter so you lose
your base with the PR stunt like this
and then you know who else you lose well
they just set it right there Claire
McCaskill for example so you lose the
Blue Dog Democrats too because the Blue
Dog Democrats know okay listen I'm from
a red state so I can't be like rah-rah
super team Democrat I have to buck
orthodoxy every now and then if I want
to get reelected cuz my state is mostly
Republicans so this is a perfect example
a perfect time where they could just
come out and say no I think the DNC the
Democratic Party is being utterly
ridiculous and what a waste of time and
effort this is so you lose the right
wing of the Democratic Party who by the
way I agree with on pretty much nothing
else but you lose you know the Claire
McCaskill's the joe Manchin's and
there's a decent number of these people
you lose them you lose the base the
Bernie supporters and the only people
who you fire up are the most partisan of
the partisan hacks the people who still
can't get over the fact that Hillary
Clinton lost and on a daily basis are
out there blaming James Comey and Gary
Johnson and Jill Stein and Vladimir
Putin and the FBI and everybody except
her they're blaming racism and sexism
and whatever they could point to that
absolves the neoliberal corporatist war
monger that is Hillary Clinton that's
what they're doing so this is yet
another way for the Democrats to not
learn the lessons of the 2016 election
and by the way everybody's making fun of
this the onion had a hilarious headline
about this they said democratic party
files lawsuit to make sure you never
forget the 2016 election I mean wouldn't
you wouldn't that be the first thing
you'd want to do if you're the Democrat
party-like okay let's try to get people
to forget the fact that we lost to a
caricature of a human being a living
parody a [ __ ] orange faced fake
haired buffoon with a low IQ who can't
string together coherent sentences and
contradicted himself every eight seconds
you lost to a circus act anybody who
hasn't totally lost the plot would go
okay let's move past this as much as
possible no they're doing the exact
opposite they don't want you to forget
that they lost a donald trump and now
they're fun they're filing a sour grapes
lawsuit and then by the way even if
you're one of the people who says okay
you know what Kyle I think there's a lot
more to this collusion story than you
let on fair enough but there's still a
giant problem with this lawsuit do you
have any idea the First Amendment
implications this has for the future the
precedent that you're setting because
what they're saying is you can't have
newsworthy information be published by
WikiLeaks WikiLeaks does when news
outlets are supposed to do hey we got
this information on elites on powerful
people they're hiding it from you they
shouldn't be hiding it from you this is
obviously in the public's interest to
learn this stuff you get to see how the
sausage is really made and our
corruption really works so WikiLeaks is
doing what all the out the mainstream
media outlets should be doing and what
the DNC is saying is no we don't like
the consequences of you doing your job
as actual journalists and reporters now
we're gonna sue you now by the way let
me just say real quick as a side point
you know I don't agree with Julian
Assange Assange his assessment of the
last election it was pretty clear and we
learned through some unearthed dm's for
example that in Julian Assange his
estimation he thought well it's better
if the Republicans win and he believed
that in the 2016 election now I don't
believe that but having said that that
doesn't mean that releasing the DNC
emails is wrong in fact it is still
clearly right because we learned about
how the election was rigged in favor of
Hillary Clinton to to argue against what
happened because of the motivations is
fundamentally preposterous because look
at what happened with you know Edward
Snowden for example Edward Snowden what
he did was technically illegal hey
you're not allowed to release you know
information that's top-secret
information that's classified
information well what if the stuff that
they classified is top secret
his stuff that shouldn't be top secret
and he's exposing crimes and wrongdoing
and that's what it was that's what he
did
he said hey by the way the NSA's taking
everybody's information and spying on
everybody and it's without a warrant so
there's no more Fourth Amendment so the
government is violating the Constitution
and the Fourth Amendment so he does that
and then what did idiots say in response
to that oh I can't believe Edward
Snowden broke the law you can't believe
Edward Snowden broke the law talk about
missing the forest through the trees the
real [ __ ] scandal here is that the
government is spying on everybody by the
same token the real scandal is not that
Julian Assange and WikiLeaks release the
emails the real scandal is what was in
the [ __ ] emails and partisan
corporate democrat loyalist hacks have
been bending over backwards to try to
not discuss the content of the emails so
much so that they just filed the most
hilarious lawsuit mired in projection of
all time where as they were exposed as
rigging an election they're now filing a
lawsuit fundamentally claiming that the
Republicans are the ones who really
rigged the election what how far up your
own ass are you that you can't see
straight
and realize you have no case here and
again even if you disagree with me on
the substance of you know collusion
that's irrelevant because what really
matters here is the principle the First
Amendment and this would have a terrible
stifling effect on free
speech and a free press if you say hey
getting information and then releasing
it when it's in the public interest
you're not allowed to do that and we'll
sue you if you do that well any
administration can take advantage of
that for any reason whatsoever so this
is the Democratic Party they've lost
their [ __ ] mind
and then by the way this is the Pied
Piper strategy also needs to be
discussed here because it's been proven
that Hillary Clinton her campaign and
the Democrats they decided oh what we
want to do is we want to build up Donald
Trump as much as possible because we
think it's a slam dunk election versus
Donald Trump so we're gonna do
everything in our power to try to make
him be viewed as the serious contender
the real candidate
so you propped him up and then you lost
to him and your claim is that well
WikiLeaks and Russia they tried to prop
up Donald Trump and we're gonna sue them
over that
why don't you suit yourselves you tried
to prop them up it was called the Pied
Piper strategy it's documented it's all
out there in the open it's proven they
have fundamentally lost their minds guys
I mean this is I can't tell you the
seething anger I was filled with when I
saw that this is the PR stunt the
Democrats are currently engaging in
listen if I wasn't in New York in fact
here I'll just say it if you're in a
state that has open primaries what the
[ __ ] are you doing being registered as a
Democrat what are you doing what are you
doing if you're in a state that allows
you to vote in democratic primaries
while being an independent I don't know
why you're still a Democrat burn your
[ __ ] card burn it right now
I'm in New York so unfortunately I can't
burn my democratic card because then I
give up my vote for example for Cynthia
Nixon versus Andrew Cuomo which I refuse
to do I give up my vote in the the next
Democratic primary where I might have
the opportunity to vote for Bernie
Sanders again or some awesome
progressive so I can't burn my
Democratic card but if you're in a state
that allows you to vote in primaries
without being a Democrat burn your
[ __ ]
right now right that what the [ __ ] you
waiting for they've totally and utterly
lost their minds
this is comical on like 13 different
levels its but against the first
amendment in a way that's above and
beyond anything I could have possibly
conceptualized beforehand like they just
simply don't understand the First
Amendment they don't understand the idea
of a free press by the way a lot of the
things that they think are proven or not
proven at all even the idea that oh well
Julian Assange definitely got that
information from Russia that's not
proven that's not proven by a [ __ ]
longshot okay and you know Julian
Assange even though I have some
substantive disagreements with him this
is the guy who gave us that for example
the Chelsea Manning leaks this is the
guy who showed how the US government was
massacring civilians and laughing about
it in Iraq and then covering it up and
not having anybody being held
responsible for it so he has a track
record at telling me the truth even
though I disagree with him on some
political issues of course but he has a
track record of telling me the truth but
and I'm supposed to trust the democratic
party that just rigged the election when
they come out and say no Julian Assange
definitely got it from Russia definitely
out the information from Russia and
listen I've got a step further than
other people in that I've said I don't
give a [ __ ] even if they got it from
Russia I don't care I want to see the
corruption it needs to be exposed what
kind of a [ __ ] [ __ ] sits there and
goes no hide the corruption for me
because I agree with the party in the
first place so I'm gonna overlook their
corruption because they're on my team
you know who does that a tribalist idiot
now I also wish that there were leaks on
the Republicans and I got to see how bad
their corruption is as well at the RNC
because I'm sure it's just as bad as the
Democrats if not worse but I mean the
idea that people would say that's a bad
thing that we got that information I
mean you have to be such a partisan hack
that it's laughable if you really take
that position so it's ridiculous the
most important reason it's ridiculous is
the Pied Piper strategy that they did
what they're accusing Russia and
so ed schultz is a former msnbc host
and he spoke to somebody from the
washington free beacon
and he dropped a bomb
on the media world listen to what he
said
there was more
oversight and more
direction
given to me on content at msnbc
than there ever has been here at rt
and
i think that it's very sad
that that story is not getting out
i think it's
uh
many times i was told what to lead with
on msnbc
many times i was told what i was not
going to do and i've got a story that
had i not been involved in it i would
have never believed it
uh and
phil griffin who i consider a friend to
this day was
was a watchdog far more than anything i
am
exposed to here at rt america did he
tell you what to say did he tell you an
angle to take
often
in fact
when bernie sanders was announcing that
he was going to be a candidate
for the nomination of the democratic
party in burlington vermont
i was the only cable host between fox
msnbc and cnn that was there live to
cover it now there were live cameras
there
but we had coordinated with the sanders
campaign that at five o'clock he was
going to make his announcement and we
were going to cover this on the ed show
i go to bernie sanders house that
afternoon an interview in the backyard
about a 15-minute interview the
grandkids are running around it's a big
day for the sanders family he's going to
announce that he's running for president
we're going to carry it live later on in
the day and we're going to run this
one-on-one tape with bernie
three thousand people are there on lake
champaign
it's five minutes to air and i get a
phone call from phil griffin
you're not covering this
i said phil
bernie sanders is announcing he's
running for president he's going to be a
president i don't care you're not
covering this
and it got rather contentious
i well uh
now you're asking me for opinion i'm
giving you a fact right now about what
happened
and other people who were there with me
will attest the fact and back me up that
this is what happened we were told that
we had to cover something down in texas
that was totally meaningless
uh in another press conference in
baltimore which was in already been in
the news for a few days
we're covering bernie sanders live we're
coordinated with his campaign
and i'm told five minutes before you're
not covering bernie sanders now let me
give you the opinion
i think the clintons were connected to
andy lack connected at the hip
i think that they didn't want anybody in
their prime time or any anywhere in
their lineup supporting bernie sanders
i think that they were in the tank for
hillary clinton and i think it was
managed and 45 days later i was out at
msnbc
[ __ ]
listen that's even more conspiratorial
in real life than i could have possibly
conceived of in my own imagination
i knew it was bad i knew that uh
generally speaking corporate media was
biased against bernie sanders
i think
anybody with a functioning brain who
follows this stuff could have figured
that that out
but what ed schultz is talking about is
a legit anti-bernie sanders conspiracy
theory
and
he was at the network which was
considered
the biggest
wing liberal network
so that is just
wow the details of that story are
absolutely mind-blowing
and then you know a lot of people have
pointed out hold on now you guys showed
trump's empty podium
you would show trump's empty podium more
than you would show bernie sanders
giving a speech bernie would actually be
out there giving a speech they wouldn't
cover that they would rather show
trump's empty podium and then speculate
non-stop about whatever [ __ ] they're
speculating about that day
so you know
there are a bunch of different ways to
look at that phenomenon and go well
something's
something's wrong here
but i i i don't think occam's razor
would have pointed to oh well obviously
it's just an overt
blatant in your face brazen conspiracy
theory where there you have some bigwigs
some corporate executives going
we will not cover bernie sanders and try
to
try to defeat him by
uh not shining any light on him
but that's exactly what happened
and the and again we're talking here
about
msnbc the network that's supposed to be
the so-called left network and imagine
how bad it was i mean fox news forget it
they try to laugh bernie out of the room
and call him a communist and then you
have cnn which was probably even worse
than msnbc
and here you have a guy who was one of
the top hosts at msnbc and he's telling
you his personal experience i mean
listen it's one thing if they tried to
like it would still be [ __ ] up and bad
and unacceptable if they tried to like
you know
massage away the coverage
when
things had already been happening and
they'd already been on the campaign
trail for a few months but we're talking
about
as bernie is launching his campaign
they were like no you're not going to
cover that you're not going to cover
you know a senator a senator who's
launching a run for president
that is nothing but a conspiracy that is
a giant conspiracy and again i know i
bring this up too much but i bring it up
because it's totally relevant and
pertinent to what's going on in the
world today
noam chomsky manufacturing consent the
whole idea of that book is
you get
you get a vision of the world that's
more reflective of elites and people in
power from corporate media than you do
from even state media
so everybody's got this idea of like oh
state media that's they're obviously
totally beholden to whichever government
is funding them
and that's a logical thing to think yeah
you're going to do the bidding of
whoever's funding you in this case it's
you have uh respective state governments
around the world whether it's qatar
whether it's the uk or whether it's
russia and they're funding state agent
state media and then you go oh dismiss
them because they're obviously going to
do propaganda for whatever state is
funding them well noam chomsky says
actually if you look at the facts and if
you look at any of the research done on
this
it proves that corporate media
is actually more beholden to elites and
the establishment than state media is to
governments
and here you have a great example of it
because you don't even need a formal
conspiracy
when
interests converge
so the same thing that's good for people
in the military industrial complex and
on wall street is the same thing that's
good for the billionaires who happen to
run the six media corporations that give
you all of your information and the last
thing any of them want is bernie sanders
getting elected increasing their tax
rate and giving everybody health care
that's the last thing that they want
and ed schultz is saying it goes even
deeper than that you had
they were buddy buddy with the clintons
and they're doing the bidding of the
clintons
and listen how
i don't know how anybody can hear this
story and go yeah i don't think that's
true
when we already know what happened at
the dnc for example
when we already know that they did
everything in their power and they bent
over backwards in order to try to
suppress bernie sanders and rigged the
primary in favor hillary clinton
changing voting times trying to hide
debates
you know all of that the the wikileaks
information that we got the emails that
we got donna brazile giving questions in
advance to hillary clinton
i mean
and the funny thing is what do
democratic loyalists do today they're
not outraged that the fact that the
[ __ ] dnc
rigged the primary against the person
who's actually left wing they're
outraged at the fact that uh you know
you discuss it and they're outraged that
oh how did we get this was it russia
that gave us this information
god damn it russia why do you give us
more facts about what
are what's happening in circles of power
in our country
i mean that's seriously the conversation
that goes on right now people act like
instead of talking about the substance
of the emails and the leaks they talk
about how outrageous and egregious it is
that we learn that information and oh my
god let's talk about
the crime of releasing the information
as opposed to what the actual
information is
that's the same trick that the
republicans did with edward snowden
where they were like oh my god can you
believe he gave us information it's
illegal that he gave us that information
yeah but the information was that the
government's [ __ ] spying on everybody
that's the bigger crime
what he's doing is he's exposing how the
government is acting in an illegal
unconstitutional way and instead of
keeping your eye on the ball and going
wow the government's being [ __ ] up
you're going oh edward snowden he did
something illegal yes he did something
illegal that he should have done
he he was exposing the crimes of the
government
and the same thing with the the
wikileaks information
people are like i can't believe that's
so [ __ ] up they gave us that
information and cost hillary the
election you should be ranting against
the fact that they rigged the [ __ ]
primary against bernie sanders
and now you know the media too rigged
against bernie sanders now
this isn't the first time that we've
heard you know
uh murmurs of stuff like this about
msnbc
because
jankuger of the young turks
he
was on msnbc for a brief amount of time
his ratings were better in that time
slot than anybody else ever in that time
slot but they tried to basically demote
him and put him on the weekend and offer
him double the money as kind of like
hush money
so that they could point to him and say
oh see we have one real strong left
winger on the show
on our on our network
so obviously
we are the lefty network so what if we
do corporate propaganda 90 of the time
at least we have this one guy on the
weekend see
and uh
what he did is he turned down the money
he turned down the weekend slot because
he said this is [ __ ] you're
basically demoting me when i had the
best ratings ever in the time slot you
put me in and then he goes on in this
clip here to explain
what happened behind the scenes
i got pulled in and they told me
hey listen uh we were just or it was
actually one specific person the head of
msnbc he said i was just in washington
and people in washington tell me that
they're concerned about your tone
i was like whoa
what
you know
despite all the things that i've said
about the mainstream media i still
viewed that as kind of like theoretical
like a real person are they really going
to say that i was like and i'm naively
thinking what does he mean did he talk
to his friend bob in washington
why would you say people are in
washington if you meant oh yeah i was
talking to my buddy down to shop about
you it just happened to be that he was a
person in washington you wouldn't frame
it that way right but i'm still thinking
that and then he gives me the second
part of the speech hey listen jank
outsiders are cool
and they wear i think he might have said
something like they wear leather jackets
they ride bikes i think i'm an outsider
i don't ride bike but i have a terrible
leather jacket anyway
he said i'd love to be an outsider
outsiders are cool but we're not we're
insiders
we are the establishment
and i just kind of sat back i was like
wow
this is it this is the speech
there it is
there it is
so you have the ed schultz example
you have the jankyuger example
and then also let's not forget
coincidentally
uh ed schultz got fired
not just you know around the time that
this was happening with bernie
but
also when he kept repeatedly hammering
the democratic president
because the democratic president
was pushing for tpp
ed schultz is an old school union guy
and he was 100 percent against tpp he
would expose on a regular basis how
terrible it would be for working people
and then there's only so much msnbc
executives can take
if you keep [ __ ] on the corporate
democratic president with his terrible
trade deal and you keep wanting to cover
the actual left winger in the race
and give him favorable coverage at that
you can ed schultz was bucking the
narrative too much
and was threatening people with money
and power too much so they had to let
him go and by the way i have a
soft spot for ed schultz because
um i had criticized him
on the issue of libya or what libya
syria's one of those he was for
intervention in either libya or syria
and i criticized him and then somebody
on twitter sent him
um the segment of me criticizing him and
he was like okay let's talk about it
i'll come on this guy's show and so when
i had only been doing secular talk
full-time for maybe a year
year and a half or whatever it was
ed schultz came on my show and we talked
about that issue
so he seemed particularly open to having
these conversations especially compared
to
you know other
other people in his position so i have a
soft spot uh for ed schultz for that
reason but then also when you see he was
one of the only voices railing against
tpp
and you know
really uh not
shying away from a fight and if he
thought that democrats were being
you know too corporate he would
immediately lash out now again i have
disagreements with him on some foreign
policy stuff but i'm under no illusions
i don't think that i had that
disagreement with him because he's you
know he's paid off or something no ed
schultz was one of the few people who
who
was in a position like this at a
mainstream network where he's proven
himself over and over and this is
another example of it here he's telling
you exactly when on
uh with bernie sanders and how they
suppressed him
we know what he did with tpp we know
what happened with jank uger because
jank was going after the democrats and
obama on a regular basis he was one of
the whole thing on msnbc was supposed to
be rah-rah democrats and you know ooh
bad republicans so if jank did a
thousand segments [ __ ] on the tea
party they'd be like okay great that's
cool
but the second he started saying well
hold on now um the democrats are also
bought by wall street and big pharma in
the military-industrial complex and
they're basically a center-right party
that's when they would be woo pump the
brakes there fella and he also tells a
story about how
uh when it came to mubarak
in egypt he was on air at msnbc
and
he basically obama spoke out of both
sides of his mouth
he would say oh you know we're with the
protesters but we're also with mubarak
and jank was openly talking on msnbc
about how what he just said to you makes
absolutely no sense
he's trying to have it both ways
because he wants the u.s to keep
supporting you know an ally of ours a
puppet dictator of ours
uh but then he also wants to appear like
he's with the people and
viva la reve revolucion and so he's
saying oh yeah the protesters are also
right
so if you call out the hypocrisy in the
contradiction of a corporate democratic
president if you rail against tpp if you
talk about how the democrats are corrupt
if you support bernie sanders
you're done
and remember phil donahue also got fired
he had the best ratings at msnbc he got
fired because he was against the iraq
war
so i just need everybody to understand
what what really is going on
at msnbc this is what's really going on
at msnbc they're not a left-wing network
they're not a progressive network
they're not a populist network they're
not a democratic socialist network
what they are is a partisan democratic
loyalist hack network
and their whole function is as a left
gatekeeper
so they say to you hey listen this is as
far as you can go and no further left
so the furthest you could go is like
chris hayes and even he's tempting fate
because he recently did a segment
calling out the israeli government for
massacring innocent peaceful palestinian
protesters and journalists so he's on
so Facebook decided to pull Richard
Spencer's various pages from their
website most of you probably know who
this guy is by now but if you don't I'll
tell you he's the head of the National
Policy Institute which I know sounds
like it's really official National
Policy Institute but understand that
that's one of the oldest tricks in the
book is you name something official
sounding but what the goal of this thing
is is anything but official it's as
Extreme as possible the goal is to
advocate a white ethno state so it's
called the National Policy Institute but
in reality it should be called like the
Nazi Institute or some [ __ ] because they
really they want a white ethno state so
they want an all-white America and I
don't I don't know I'm sure there's
differing opinions within the membership
of the National Policy Institute but I'm
sure some of them the the more kind
white nationalists all they want to do
is deport all the non-white people even
if they're American and they were born
here doesn't matter deport all the
non-white people how kind you are I'm
sure there's some that are part of this
Institute that want to kill and do a
genocide of all non-white people but
either way this is an extremist group
that we're talking about here so the
National Policy Institute page was
pulled that had about 4,000 followers
and then Spencer's online magazine all
right calm had a Facebook page with more
than 10,000 followers and that was
pulled as well so Zuckerberg was asked
in congressional testimony recently and
he said listen Facebook we don't
tolerate hate groups but then what
happened was I think it was vice news or
some media outlet contacted Facebook I
was like really cuz we just looked it up
and we found like whatever a couple
hundred of them or something and so they
let Facebook know and then Facebook that
day went and pulled all the pages for
all those people so this is one of those
issues where there's going to be there's
a split on the left as to what the right
thing to do is I have a clear opinion on
it I think you all know
opinion is uh I I wouldn't have done it
I wouldn't have pulled it first of all
he only has 4000 followers for the
National Policy Institute and only a
little over 10,000 for all right calm
that means that's not that's not that
many okay but even if it was a lot I
would still keep it because I think that
the more people see what this guy's
about the more they say hey [ __ ] him in
fact that's what have a friend of mine
spoke to me about this and was like I
literally didn't know what the alt-right
was until they saw the video of that
conference that they had in Washington
and Richard Spencer gave a speech and
started saying Heil Trump Heil our
people hail victory hail victory that's
Sieg Heil that's what [ __ ] Hitler
said and then people in the audience
were all doing the [ __ ] Hitler salute
so a friend of mine was telling me I
didn't know how bad they were then I saw
how bad they were I was like oh okay
that's what's going on you're Nazis got
it so I think the more you show people
what they are the better because that
hurts them the worst thing you do is you
ban them you push them underground and
then you're making it like a
counterculture edgy thing that people
like ooh we're not allowed to say these
things therefore it must be cool because
that's why everybody shuns you know
shuns it reality is if you just let
these guys have their [ __ ] say I
think that turns more people off to them
but so but even if you don't buy that
argument and I understand there are
people that don't buy that argument I
don't know why you should buy all the
evidence points in that direction I mean
for example remember when these idiots
were protesting to keep a Confederate
statue up by the way great way to spend
your time I'm so offended and triggered
that you're taking down a [ __ ]
Confederate statue Wow
but what happened was they had the tiki
torches and the white lives matter [ __ ]
they were chanting and all the Jews will
not replace us super racist and
anti-semitic and all that
but what happened was the very next
event people forget about that the very
next event when they were scheduled to
protest again there were only like 12 of
them and thousands of counter protesters
so that's what happens when you show it
to the world the world goes [ __ ] you but
again so even if you don't buy that
argument fine fair enough but there's
another reason why you should say hey
Facebook don't don't do this now to be
clear they have every legal right to do
it because anybody who's familiar with
the legality of the First Amendment
knows that just stops the government
from persecuting you or locking you up
over speech so but that's where it's
limited in other words it doesn't if you
get banned from Twitter or banned from
Facebook or social media there are
private companies they have every right
to do it but what I'm arguing is just
beyond the legal right of the First
Amendment I'm arguing for the principle
of the First Amendment which means even
though Twitter and Facebook have the
right to ban people like this I'm
arguing they shouldn't do that even
though they have the right to do it
because it's the principle the First
Amendment that matters which I think
goes beyond just the legality of the
First Amendment in the constant and what
is and isn't constitutional but here's
the reason why you should still say hey
man don't they shouldn't ban it because
okay so they pull white nationalist
that's what this is we're gonna pull
white nationalists because their hate
groups and you know what I don't agree
with the pulling them but do I think
their hate groups of course yeah I think
what they do is hate no doubt about it
[Music]
but then that brings up an interesting
legal question what do you do with black
nationalists now for example Malcolm X
was a black nationalist as he got in his
older years and when he left the Nation
of Islam and he became a lot more like
Martin Luther King jr. he was originally
the super hardline guy who said we need
a black nation and we're not for
segregation were for separation from
white people that's what he argued he
argued that black people in the US
should be treated like Israel with the
Jews how the UN should say here's a
piece of land and you get your own land
and install black state basically so he
was a black separatist he was a black
nationalist now
we all at least reasonable people
understand that that's not exactly the
same thing as being a white nationalist
because you could argue hey was the
historical oppression of black people in
this country slavery segregation that
makes it a reaction to the dominant
society so it's not morally equivalent
to that of white nationalism and I think
that's a fair argument to make however
all you need to do is acknowledge that
there are some people who are gonna say
black nationalism is exactly equivalent
to white nationalism because you're
saying we're gonna base a state on our
ethnic identity in that sense it is
equivalent but all you need is some
people to say it is exactly the same
thing just a mirror image forget the
context and then that raises an
interesting question if you're gonna ban
white nationalists there is certainly an
argument that you should ban black
nationalists to a Nation of Islam gone
any black nationalist movements even if
they cloak themselves and the argument
of we're doing it because we believe in
equality we're doing because we believe
in civil rights you come with a wagon of
rationalizations but there are gonna be
some people who say no that's exactly
the same thing white nationalism in
black nationalism just a mirror image
they're reverse extremes so if you ban
white nationalists you're probably going
to put Facebook in a position where they
if they don't ban black nationalists you
go okay well you're hypocrites and
that's [ __ ]
okay or they ban it and then people turn
around and go well now you're racist cuz
you banned a black nationalist and then
okay so let's say you ban white
nationalists and then black nationalists
is up in the air
well what about communists you know now
again you could say well that's not
objectively as hateful as Nazism but
what you guys need to understand is even
if that's true all you need is some
people to say it is and then you're
[ __ ] and then they probably will ban
communists because the argument that a
lot of people make is whether or not you
buy the argument is irrelevant this is
the argument some people are going to
make
this is an argument that ultimately
might end up being the final straw that
makes the decision for them where they
do ban communist where they'll say look
at the body count look at the body count
of people who died under Nazism and
fascism and then look at the body count
of people who died under communism and
they could say the Communist body count
is even worse than the fascist body
count so what you gonna do you're gonna
leave the Communist but banned the
fascists that doesn't seem to make much
sense now again you don't have to buy
that argument but somebody is going to
make that argument and that argument
might be the final argument that they
make these decisions based off of so if
you ban white nationalists they're gonna
want to ban black nationalists if you
ban fascists they're gonna want to ban
communists it what about for example
there's a perfect example of why you
shouldn't go down the slippery slope
what about atheists who live in
theocracies what about that so you and I
look at atheists and we go oh that's a
legitimate minority group that has
anybody as much right as anybody else to
speak about anything okay but atheists
in theocracies are tarred as blasphemous
dangerous undermining the entire system
doing hate speech against the dominant
majority and our ideology and our belief
system namely religion in most cases
around the world today if you live in a
theocracy Islamic theocracy so and we've
seen this Facebook has done business
with all these different governments
around the world and they do what those
governments tell them to do in Israel
try being a Palestinian group on
Facebook they've banned so many
pro-palestine groups because Facebook is
working with Israel and Israel says oh
they're doing hate speech oh they're
anti-semitic and then Israel pulls the
page Pro BDS pages pro-palestine freedom
movement pages so this is the point when
we have these debates and have these
conversations they don't happen in a
[ __ ] vacuum they happen with context
everywhere and they're these arguments
are going to be made once you start
banning people you could avoid the whole
conversation it's not bad anyone
that's what I would do I would say no we
allow everybody the only things that's
not allowed our direct threats of
violence libel and slander and libel and
slander notoriously are hard to proven
they should be hard to prove you know
what I mean but and direct threats of
violence yes you should be banned for
that and you should be banned for daxing
or whatever actual crimes banned outside
of that it's gotta be all systems go let
anything happen because once you start
nitpicking that there's no end to the
nitpicking there's no end to it and
again you don't even have to buy the
argument of equivalence between these
groups but somebody will make the point
that they're equivalent and then
whoever's making decisions might say I
agree with that argument more than the
people who say it's not equivalent again
black nationalist versus white
nationalist fascists first communists to
go back to the example of atheists in
religious countries and theocracies
those governments will tell facebook no
if you want to operate in our country
you're gonna ban whatever atheists in
Saudi Arabia atheists in Iran obviously
I don't they don't allow Facebook but
whatever atheists in some theocracy
you're gonna ban atheist groups in our
country because under our laws that's
hateful they're doing hate speech
against us and we need to put a stop to
that now again that's none of that's
true atheists are not actually doing
hate speech they're not actually doing
anything wrong they should be able to
voice their opinion but when Facebook
starts banning people and starts bending
to the will of you know hey don't allow
this do allow that don't allow that
well then everybody's gonna have an
argument it's not only you in the world
who gets to dictate what should and
shouldn't be allowed and what offends me
is very different from what offends a
[ __ ] Ted Cruz fan what offends me is
very different than what offends a
[ __ ] random Saudi prince who's in
favor of all these repressive policies
so in my mind you draw a clean line and
say no we don't ban anybody based on
that but if it's daxing if it's direct
threats of violence yes we'll ban them
but outside of that no we don't ban
anybody except the rules or don't accept
the rules but they're not doing that
Facebook loves to just immediately
[ __ ] cave and just give like all the
pressure from the government and and
what's their argument oh you better
filter fake news and [ __ ] Rush is bad
I hope your stop
being [ __ ] propaganda from Russia on
and so now they're begging Silicon
Valley oligarchs to filter what news you
do see and don't see and you're supposed
to trust Mark Zuckerberg judgment as to
what's a legitimate news story and
what's not I don't trust that
[ __ ] judgment but this is
what's happening and now they're going
down the [ __ ] slippery slope of what
well ban white nationalist cuz they're
why nationalists we ban black
nationalists hey we'll ban fascist will
you Ben and by the way one of their
sources that they said oh the Southern
Poverty Law Center was one of their
sources listen the Southern Poverty Law
Center has done a lot of great work so I
don't want to act like I'm a hundred
percent against them I'm not but they've
also done some questionable [ __ ] they've
added guys who by the way I don't agree
with this guy a lot there's a guy named
Maajid Nawaz who's a [ __ ] you know X
Muslim I think is a little bit of a
pompous douchebag but he's doesn't he's
not a [ __ ] hate merchant but they
added him to their list of like you know
anti-muslim hate group [ __ ] like that's
the Southern Poverty Law Center they
just added Rania Khalek and [ __ ] max
Blumenthal and Ben Norton to a group of
like they pulled down this article thank
goodness but they acted like a [ __ ]
propping up dictators and they do hate
speech what the [ __ ] all cuz they don't
want to do regime change in Syria so in
other words none of this stuff is not
objective and scientific and broken down
and so we know these people are extreme
and these people aren't a lot of it's a
matter of opinion and trying to figure
it out but what they're doing is banning
Richard Spencer and who knows where the
[ __ ] that slippery slope ends in my mind
that slippery slope does not end because
that immediately leads to banning the
black nationalists and banning the
communists and [ __ ] I mean you could
really do stretch arguments here say I'm
a hate speech guy cuz I curse that
[ __ ] world leaders as I rant against
them or whatever you know you can argue
my promoting of atheism is dangerous in
some countries because there are
theocracies and blah and those arguments
aren't true but they don't have to be
true you can be true enough for the
idiots and power to make it move against
them and that's what I'm afraid of and
that's why I wouldn't abandon or Spencer
and I hope you see the logic of that
hello everybody yo how y'all doing today
I was just commenting to Koren about how
we look like we're basically basically
like somebody took the same DNA and just
like put a different shirt on the thing
we just look like the carbon like copy
of a generic white boy with like that's
why this go ahead the [ __ ] um cartoon
I want this to to make all he's got to
do is just [ __ ] modify that [ __ ]
you're still upset about the cartoon
that's hilarious but you have the white
shirt on I have the gray shirt on it
literally looks like our hair is exactly
the same yeah like our [ __ ] is both a
little [ __ ] up that's why I like when
um they would it would be like black
girls in high school or Spanish girls or
whatever they would always just be like
oh that white boy and he I cou like the
white boy with the spiky hair like we're
all the same
well definitely in our high school too
because of our hair everybody had the
spiky hair mm-hm it was just everybody
had the spiky it was just across the
board every white dude had the spiky
hair and the gel yeah that's why it's
like when you're explaining a white boy
like us it's just like that white boy
like yeah like how do you yes I'm saying
you could be talking about you me yes
dude who's got the blowout like yeah
it's like he's you know he's like 510 or
maybe 6 feet he's got like a normal
frame he's not like too big not too
small but like if I'm explaining like
like if there was his black dude I saw
or something like that like they're so G
in the way they look you could be like
dude he had he had that chisel like in
his hair and was wearing that she was
like oh that's rod there was a dude in
my business law class back in high
school his name was Octavius he had like
that's like a powerful name and he had
these giant Falcon earrings that took up
like his whole goddamn earlobe and like
he had a little bit of acne on his
cheeks but he was so G that he almost
made acne cool that I looked at him and
I was like damn he's sort of rocking
that a little bit it's like he chose to
have like a few little bumps on his
cheeks on
both cheeks that's why I like that ass
like black people don't get enough
credit for just being like the most
awesome like people well they're
definitely trendsetters there's a
trendsetters by a mile it's just they do
[ __ ] that like you like everyone's just
like I can't pull that off I can't do
that like like you're talking about
earrings I remember black girls in high
school used to have like these big-ass
earrings with their name like in the
[ __ ] and I'll be like damn like no other
like you can't no one can't pull that
[ __ ] off because you're just confident
and they just wear that [ __ ] did you
over rock the necklace with your name on
it no I never had the necklace but I had
I had a ring that had CC on it had CC on
by the way 18 years old I would wear I
feel like this conversation we're having
is super new Yorkish like I feel like
there's there's somebody listening right
now in like California who's like
[ __ ] you had your initials on a
ring okay they're gonna think that's
crazy when they hear that well that's
what makes like New York unique there's
a mix of everything you go to California
everybody's got a surfboard got like I
don't know what a California high school
look like but I'm sure everybody was
just the same in class like I don't know
how widespread earrings on boys is like
we every a lot of guys at our high
school like earring guys wearing
earrings was a big thing oh yeah it was
almost as normal as a dude wearing a
watch or a dude wearing a necklace yeah
but like I don't know I don't think
that's a thing in a lot of places like I
don't think that and that was it and let
me be clear for everybody
it wasn't like people looked at a dude
who wore earrings and they thought like
oh he's probably gay like that wasn't a
thing like the thing was if you wore one
earring on the right ear then that's
supposed to be a sign that you're gay
yeah if you wore one earring on the left
ear or if you wore two earrings that was
like probably the majority of the dudes
we went to high school with including us
mm-hmm so but I don't know how
widespread of a thing that was you know
what I mean like I don't know if that
like metrosexual type thing is a little
specific to
New York you know what I mean I would
have to say it is because I mean I just
I don't know how it started but I got my
ear pierced when I was like in third
grader like something you had a way
before me like really young but I'm
coming to think of it it's just like why
was it a thing because I remember like
we as a family we went to icing or
whatever the [ __ ] it was Claire's right
and and like maybe my brother wanted to
get one or something like that and then
my dad was like all right like I'm gonna
get one so we all just got one but I
don't know who my brother saw or what
like what made him do it but to your
point I feel like it was only like a
East Coast New York Long Island type of
maybe Jersey was in on it or something
like that
yeah I feel like North East maybe but if
anybody's listening and they're from I
don't know the Midwest or they're from
the west coast like you comment in the
comment section if you if that was the
thing that was commenter on you because
here if you saw a dude with earrings a
young dude with the earrings you don't
think twice you're just like okay and I
wonder if it was if I had to guess I
don't know for sure but if I had to
guess I feel like that started like
black people started that and then white
people were like I'm gonna I'm gonna do
that too yep you know what I mean and I
don't think it translated to Florida
because I remember I think I went to
Florida to visit a friend when I was in
high school when I had both my ears
pierced and I went to like a high school
basketball game in Miami or something
like that and they had their own trends
and I had the earrings and that like
like separated me they were like oh
you're from CAA like I was like a I'm
from New York so they were like I must
have just like oh that's how you do it
up there like this is our our style down
here you know like by the way another
thing like that
that definitely started with black
people and white people still don't
really do it lineups
yeah and tape up yeah all that stuff
from the barber shop the fades I feel
like white and black like you'll have
white dudes and black dudes have always
gotten fades but the lineup especially
in the front like I feel like when I was
young and I went to a white barbershop
mm-hmm they would do the lot they would
line you up in the back
and they'd like do your sideburns but
they would never do the front they'd
never do it across and they'd never do
it on the sides here and then the first
time I went to a black barber and they
do it and they did it he like blew my
mind but then I'm also like God like it
looks so much better when you line it up
in the front okay
how the [ __ ] did Y plate not think like
did not didn't do that yeah I mean I
think that they think no or just
naturally like real I mean the others
probably plenty of things that you do it
I mean you look at trends like closing
all this [ __ ] and there's a hit and a
Miss in my opinion like the skinny jeans
is like that was just such a like just
really skinny ones like those shits got
popular and I was like I don't know
you're doing but to be fair we were when
we were young we had the baggy jeans
were in and I thought those look good
but then now if you look back at some of
the the sizes of the jeans and just
pants in general from back in the day it
was too baggy oh yeah and you're like oh
that like you you're purposely like two
sizes too big with that [ __ ] yeah my
friends have a picture of Tiger Woods in
like 1999 or some [ __ ] and the pants he
was wearing were barrique Ashley baggy
like it's like he was playing a joke on
everybody like he's like he dressed as a
clown on purpose to be like haha you
guys didn't notice my pants are eight
sizes too big but I was just have what
he wore it like almost looks like
Photoshop I saw a picture of Russell
Westbrook like that and it's so funny
because now all these NBA players they
plenty of money they have stylist and so
like they're all trying to look fly and
all this [ __ ] but there's pictures of
him and Dwyane Wade to to your point
like wearing jeans that like you almost
look like that's not a real photo right
like those jeans I don't even know how a
belt could hold those shits up because
yes like and you'd have two nice legs
for tight jeans too like you can't go
for tight jeans yeah like you can if you
have even slightly skinny legs
pump your brakes on the tight jeans well
that's why in middle school I know for
me I don't know who else but I was super
like skinny I was just skinny kid so I
would always wear like double XL [ __ ]
and I would think like oh if I wear a
double XL t-shirt like
maybe a look like i'll look not bigger
but uh it probably was a reason to like
compensate with the fact that I was so
skinny you know I in middle school who
was skinnier you were me I I feel like
you might have been skinnier because you
were you were taller so you're like like
lankier yeah exactly I think that's true
but I was gonna say I've always had a
skewed perception I remember I was
skinny for a long time and then I think
how old was I was I like 18 or something
maybe 20 19 maybe when I started working
out and then I put on a lot of weight
when I started working out but I always
feel like the perception I had am of
myself always legs at least five years
behind where the reality is I'll never
forget that my one of my friends had met
this dude and he became a friend of
theirs they had met him at a restaurant
and they hung out with him it turns out
that this dude was like from a stupid
rich family
like the richest like on some [ __ ] where
I think his dad was one of the suppliers
for like a Walmart or something crazy
like two insanely rich they had the
[ __ ] giant house on like Greenwich or
something and so I didn't know this guy
but they invited me to go hang out with
him and I was like all right whatever no
problem I didn't know anything about him
at the time
okay cool no problem so we went to this
kid's house
dude it was it was such it was so
ridiculous it was uncomfortable like I
looked down this dudes hallway and I
couldn't see the end of it that's how
big the house was god I was like I don't
see the goodness of the hallway it's it
was it's like he lived in like this
[ __ ] giant like hotel type [ __ ] yeah
I remember it is a long way of me
mentioning that that guy called me to my
friends when I wasn't there he said Kai
his perception of me was that I was a
quite sounds like he's about to suck the
meaty Guido he said he said I looked
like a meaty Guido I was this got a
pedophile or as long as you know this
dude he was he was he was younger than
us actually he was like but it was a kid
him by
did you know okay I probably didn't even
need to tell that whole long as part of
the story but no it was one of my
friends had met this kid and they became
friends and then I would just kind of
like invited to hang out with my friend
who then was like we're gonna go hang
out with this other kid that I'm going
back to when I was like maybe 19 or 20
at the time when this happened but it
was when I had start I had work been
working out for maybe a year at that
point and I hadn't done a lot of weight
but in my mind's eye I was still super
[ __ ] skinny oh it's still like a
little scrawny kid but to this kid he
didn't know me from two years ago so he
looked at me and in his mind he thought
I was like a meaty Guido he thought I
was like yeah you know [ __ ] jacked
and big and I was like what I knew what
kid like that well it's funny how like
if you have if you have what is it a
encounter with someone at a point in
their life where they're vulnerable or
you know like they're they're awkward
like there was a girl in our high school
who was dope like everybody thought she
was hot and like but I remember someone
telling me in middle school or something
she used to pick her nose or maybe I saw
her picking her nose or something like
that so when everybody we used to talk
about her in high school I always for
some reason would just be like god like
I just remember like either seeing her
pick her nose and it was grimy or there
was another girl who and I sound mad
superficial and all this [ __ ] because
maybe she was the nicest girl on the
inside and I was just looking at looks
but [ __ ] we all were in high school
but she had on crazy amount of acne like
bad like like craters and [ __ ] like that
but her body was dope and then years
later like that [ __ ] went away and
everyone was like sweating her and I was
like nah man I'd still see that chick
from high school with the craters and
the pimples so like you see yourself
every day but this kid saw you at this
one point where you might have been brow
like or you know bigger so that's how he
saw you but like if your boy was there
and he knew you your whole life he would
be like nah
mad skinny you know exactly exactly and
it's kind of it's almost it's [ __ ] up
it's [ __ ] up for a variety of reasons
I mean when it comes to self perception
and at least in my case probably with a
lot of people listening to your self
perception lags behind what the reality
is you know what I mean
but then also like you said there's
something that happens when somebody
gets like a label and like it becomes a
cultural thing or it becomes like when
everybody already agrees that person X
has this quality or that quality then
it's just like that becomes its own
thing and the reality of it almost
doesn't matter like so that's almost
like well like a little bow well I mean
like it's just like you can't switch
your name to bow well because we've
known you as little Bala you're always
gonna be little like or if the I can't
think of a like it snoop lion snoop dogg
snoop lion like yeah like something like
Big Pun if you're naming yourself Big
Pun because you're 400 pounds or
whatever and then you try and lose like
300 pounds and you're this skinny rapper
now we're gonna be like nah man like
yeah cool well I think what they said to
Kevin James they were like don't lose
weight like you're the fat guy like
you're the funny fat guy yeah the same
with jonah goldberg or whatever his name
is
Oh Jonah Hill Jonah Hill oh there isn't
there is a Jonah Goldberg but it's not
the actor it's I think it's a political
guy I always all those two mixed up but
there was you remind me of a story when
you were talking about how somebody had
acne back in the day and that just kind
of stuck with you even though they
didn't when they got older um I may have
told the story on the podcast but there
was one time where I think I was in
third grade and this kid who you and I
both know from later on obviously you
didn't meet him yet in third grade but
he was laughing so hard at this kid's
jokes and I could I remember him
laughing like for 10 minutes straight
every time like I have memories from
third grade of this kid laughing so hard
because somebody was telling funny jokes
and we were all like segmented into like
little groups of three or whatever doing
some sort of a project and then he
laughed so hard that he pissed his pants
in
class in third grade not not a little
bit a straight-up like giant ass puddle
on the floor type [ __ ] mmm can you
imagine how mortifying that is man when
your grade like I yeah terrible for him
and I liked him and and he's he's a cool
kid but I think even I like after that
incident was a little bit like I don't
know if I could talk to you for like
three or four days dog uh-huh do you
know what I mean like in all my that a
you've third great attitude that that's
like what I was thinking you can't you
can't I mean that third grade you don't
even know how to like G a situation like
that like if that I would almost say
like if that happened in trying to say
if that would happen in college and you
could almost just be like [ __ ] I had
to pee really bad like it would still be
weird but you could probably own it a
little bit more when you're older
yeah you don't know how to like you
can't handle [ __ ] when you're that yeah
I remember in I think it was first grade
I went to the bathroom during class and
when I came back in everybody everybody
started laughing
and I was like why the [ __ ] is everybody
laughing because I had just I walked
back in the room and then everybody
started laughing and I was like what the
[ __ ] happened and then one of the kids
who was probably my best friend at the
time this kid named Nick and he was like
I told everybody you were you were
taking a [ __ ] basically and I guess when
I came back quickly he was like he was
like that was fast or whatever and then
everybody laughs in a class and I was
like I was again this is like like
defend yourself exactly I was like
mortified I was like angry at him I was
like why would you say that like I was
so I was down in like the gutter over
that I'd like that was worth
soul-crushing to me cuz then everybody
in the [ __ ] classroom had this image
of me [ __ ] and I didn't want to
[ __ ] it's almost like on some on some
Trump [ __ ] like trying to protect your
image type [ __ ] you know I mean like no
I don't do that I'm tremendous I'm
unbelievable like that was first grade
Kyle who was like no you're the guys
aren't supposed to thinking of me doing
that because I don't do that because I'm
special
you know what I mean yeah yeah so kid
there was a kid it's so weird because
it's like now being older and like
seeing kids that you knew when you were
younger doing like younger people's [ __ ]
like there was a kid at my sleepaway
camp for some reason people were [ __ ]
with him he was like taking a shower and
like they pulled the curtain on him or
some [ __ ] and he was like blocking his
like his dick with like two of his
fingers or something like that and
everybody was just clowning him because
he was only now he's like he's like a
real estate like a top real estate dude
in like New York City or some [ __ ] and
you think of his two fingers for that
but then I went back cuz we slept in
tents and I was like I think I probably
would block my [ __ ] with two fingers
also look let me ask you about about
camp cuz I never went to sleepaway camp
I feel like and this might be [ __ ] up
of me but I'll say it anyway
I feel like there's that's probably like
fertile [ __ ] ground for some
pedophile ass [ __ ] you know whatever
adults that run this [ __ ] you know what
I mean just the Catholic Church with the
priests like that's like a magnet for
pedophiles cuz then they get access to
kids with their guard down yeah well I
get sleepaway camp that's a good point I
mean there probably was a lot of [ __ ]
going on at some I mean like luckily no
[ __ ] happen to me but there's definitely
so there's been wall-to-wall pro-war
coverage happening on mainstream media
recently that goes for CNN and MSNBC and
the nightly news and of course most of
the voices on Fox News are for war but
believe it or not there are some
dissenting voices and the dissenting
voices are coming solely from Fox News
so Tucker Carlson is one of those
dissenting voices he had on Glenn
Greenwald and they spoke about this
issue of going to war in Syria now for
those of you who don't know the
backstory here what happened was there
was an alleged gas attack the West is
claiming that Bashar Assad attacked
civilians with chlorine gas the reality
is there's been no investigation we
should also note that the last two times
there were accusations of this happening
it was debunked and in fact one time it
was even the rebels who used the
chemical weapons so that seems pretty
important to me to bring up it also
seems pretty important to me to bring up
the fact that Assad gave up his chemical
weapons now again some people will
listen to this and they'll you know
accuse me of being some sort of naive
conspiracy theorist or something but
this is that's all a matter of public
record I mean I remember covering the
stories it was John Kerry when he was
Secretary of State and there was a top
Russian official he was talking to and
they were doing a press conference and
basically the top Russian official said
listen is there anything that Assad
could do so that you guys don't attack
him and John Kerry said well he gives up
his chemical weapons we won't attack him
but that's not gonna happen and then the
very next day they came out and said
okay I he agrees take all this chemical
weapons so a guy who gave up his
chemical weapons a guy who by the way
has basically already won the war a guy
who just heard Donald Trump talking
about how you know the West is gonna get
out of Syria any minute now that's what
Trump had been saying at rallies so he's
that guy is gonna gratuitously Massacre
civilians which is basically the one
thing he could have done that would ramp
up the the war propaganda again
get the US and the West mired in Syria
even more so it's just wow it mighty
[ __ ] convenient that neo-cons like
john bolton he just came to the White
House and then his wet dream comes true
and you have you know this now this
fervor and this non-stop propaganda
escalating to war yes in a very similar
way to what we saw with the Iraq war so
wall to wall pro war coverage everywhere
you look
honestly the best-case scenario you get
from some people is just silence because
most people are either pro war and then
there's some people who are silent which
is basically a tepid endorsement of
what's happening which is this war
fervor going on across the country and
just a handful of dissenting voices
here's one of them right here Tucker
Carlson he's gonna talk to Glenn
Greenwald about it let's watch before we
go to war are we sure all of this is
real do we really know that Assad was
behind the gas attack it's not a
defensive Assad but it's an obvious
question how could we know that
conclusively so soon after the attack
happened we didn't have any Americans on
the ground and why would a Sat do that
given the certainty it would hurt his
own interests and while we're on the
subject by the way why is a war in Syria
a good idea for the United States in the
first place how would it make us safer
happier more prosperous those seem like
reasonable questions to us in fact the
exact questions you'd want your
policymakers to ask but no they're not
asking them and they're offended to hear
them the first person we asked those
questions to Republican senator Roger
wicker of Mississippi implied that we
were somehow allied with Vladimir Putin
just for asking
other than that wicker had no answers at
all it was embarrassing it he didn't
seem embarrassed at all others just
denounced us right off the top Jennifer
Rubin of the Washington Post tweeted
this quote he is insane meaning me Fox
is not a news organization that is all
Noah Rothman of commentary called this
show quote nothing less than undeleted
Russian propaganda
Seth Mandel the New York Post summarized
the criticism perfectly when he tweeted
this very simply shut the F up these are
journalists by the way no explanation of
course shutting the eff up is the whole
point of tweets like that they want you
to be quiet and want you to do what
you're told no more questions shut up
and obey there's no chance of that
though sorry Glenn Greenwald has been
following all of this he's an founding
editor at the intercept and he joins us
tonight so Glenn you know leaving aside
the real question of how you should
respond to Syria and is it a threat to
the world order and to us and to its
neighbors I think those are all fair
questions but why the universal attempt
in the meeting here in this country left
and right to shut down a meaningful
conversation about it the only time I
think that the media praised Donald
Trump was almost one year ago today when
he bombed an airfield in Syria in
response to what had been alleged at the
time was an ikemen attack by the Assad
regime
people who hate Donald Trump and go on
there every day took a break for 24
hours to proclaim him presidential
because that's what US presidents and
their eyes do is they just drop bombs on
other countries with no declaration of
war no reason why the US interest or the
u.s. borders are at stake when it
happens so I think that's just the ethos
in Washington that not only is it just
an inherently good and presidential
thing to do to drop bombs on other
countries that's why polls around the
world show that the greatest threat to
world peace on the eyes of the public in
around the world is United States but
also you know Adam Smith wrote three
hundred years ago that the reason people
who live in capitals and in the elites
and countries love to watch their
countries bomb other countries is
because it gives them sense of
excitement and purpose and kind of this
pulsating stimulation and they think
that's a really big part of it it
doesn't matter whether it will
accomplish anything it just makes us
feel strong and powerful and purposeful
to do and so just bombs away I think
that's right I mean I think human nature
explains a lot of this I agree
completely but journalists exist to push
back against that not necessarily
against war but against a heedless rush
toward anything I mean our job is to be
skeptical and ask real questions why is
no one doing that and anyone who does is
attacked so you know just about every
name that you mentioned in the media who
who attacked you for raising questions
about whether or not we ought to
actually go in bomb another country are
all essentially neo cons the the same
people who were doing this in 2002 and
2003 saying anyone who asked questions
about whether we should actually go to
war and remove Sodom Hussein a little it
was a mirror of the Saddam regime they
did the same in 2011 when it came time
to remove Gaddafi they said if you're
against that war it means you love
Gadhafi and you want to see him
slaughter people it's just the standard
tactic and what we have now is this kind
of union between neo-cons who who have
now once again kind of been embraced by
both the establishment wings of the
Republican and Democratic Party and the
militarist and Bowl party people like
Lindsey Graham and lots of Democrats who
love every single war and so this
climate arises that you're just supposed
to cheer when it comes time to drop
bombs on other countries not ask whether
there's evidence to justify it not ask
whether it will do any good not ask
whether it will kill any civilians and
if you do ask those questions it means
you're on the side of America's enemies
it's an incredibly authoritarian tactic
that gets used to suppress to me so
let's understand this we have a
Republican president and the networks
that at least in name are supposed to be
liberal networks like CNN and MSNBC they
are not the ones actually resisting the
Republican president who's about to get
us further involved in a war another war
about to attack directly the Syrian
government and on the Republican
propaganda Network Fox News and make no
mistake about it that's exactly what Fox
News is you have a few voices that are
bucking orthodoxy and saying no I don't
agree with the Republican president and
what it looks like he's about to do
right now man what a weird bizarre world
we live in if you told me you know the
day Trump got elected that this is what
would happen that you'd have Trump
taking us to war in Syria even more so
than we already are by the way because
we have been bombing Syrian aligned
troops in there and we have of course
funded and propped up rebels and backed
rebels but if you told me he was gonna
get us even more involved there and that
the dissenting voices would not be
coming from the liberal networks the
so-called liberal networks I would have
said no there's no way that that's true
because the
people who proclaim the most that
they're part of the hashtag resistance
and that that's all they're about as a
resist we have to resist this terrible
president he's so bad you would think
that they would take I don't know one of
the main things that Trump is about to
do which is super unpopular and they
would say yes we're gonna be we're gonna
be leading voices in the charge against
against this but no they're theirs
they're nowhere to be found and that's
so wild to me and it's all so wild that
look at this reflection that you get in
the media of public opinion they give
you a misperception that well everybody
agrees that we should be going to war
you know like I said all across the
nightly news MSNBC CNN basically every
establishment pundit is in favor of
going to war in Syria and like Glenn
Greenwald pointed out the last time they
bombed the Syrian air base Fareed
Zakaria came out there and said now his
presidential Brian Williams spoke about
the beauty of our weapons but that is a
total and complete misdirection from the
opinions of the American people because
to the extent they've done polling on
this issue and they did all the way back
in I think it was like 2013 when Obama
first floated the idea of going into
Syria it was something like 17 percent
of the American people or 20 some 21
percent or thereabouts were like yeah
let's go to war in Syria which means the
overwhelming majority not just of
Democrats but also independents and
Republicans said no we don't want to go
to Syria so you have this you know
silent majority in the country this
broad swath of the American public and
then in the media you flipped those
numbers so it's about 80 percent maybe
more maybe over 80 percent of pundits in
the media say no we should go to war and
20 percent are against it but in the
country it's 80 percent who are against
it and 20 percent who are for it so this
is how again I hate to bring this up
again cuz I bring it up seemingly every
show but this is exactly like Noam
Chomsky's manufacturing consent this is
exactly what he said would happen and
what he says does happen when it comes
to corporate media in the u.s. you have
basically an entire
apparatus that is more beholden to the
US government and power then state
government is to other governments so
when you look at state media excuse me
that that's why I was trying to say
state and media is beholden to other
governments so when you look at state
media you go well obviously they're
gonna be the biggest puppets of their
funding source their funding source
being whatever respective government it
may be when you look at you know RT well
they're funded by Russia so they're
gonna be beholden by them you have al
Jazeera who's funded by Qatar so they're
gonna be beholden to them BBC funded by
the UK so on and so forth but Noam
Chomsky's point was no no it's actually
a little counterintuitive corporate
media is actually more beholden to the
US government than then state media is
to the respective governments that fund
them and his reasoning is listen they're
the elites that run these corporations
are in the same circles
as the establishment politicians so it's
all the billionaire class and so you're
gonna get a picture of the world that
reflects their interests and what is
what is the war in Syria do does it
reflect the interests of you know your
average Joe in Kentucky no it reflects
the interests of the military-industrial
complex so this is it we're doing it
again man this is Iraq all over again
this is Libya all over again we did an
intervention in Libya and then now today
we have open slave markets in Libya so
even though everybody can accurately and
correctly point to Gaddafi and say that
guy's a [ __ ] monster it is also true
that the u.s. of course we were under no
direct threat of attack from Gadhafi and
then what business is it of ours to go
in there and [ __ ] topple the guy when
what followed is even worse
same thing with Saddam in Iraq nobody is
Pro Saddam when they said hey let's not
do the war in Iraq what they're saying
is he's posing no direct threat of
violence against us so this isn't a
defensive war this would be an offensive
war on our part and then furthermore you
have no idea what would come next you
don't know what would come next you
don't know if it's gonna be worse what
replaces him and then now in this
situation we're talking about by the way
report from a few years ago found that
about 60% of the Syrian rebels are
hardline Islamists and then now these
geniuses in the West the neo cons are
saying well we should topple them and
then everything will be great
are you [ __ ] kidding me so who do you
thinks gonna fill that vacuum the most
competent and and you know powerful and
persistent fighting force in the region
that's Isis and al-qaeda
that's Isis and al-qaeda that's not
conjecture
that's not opinion that's a fact and
they're also this just this idea that we
care that you know oh my god Donald
Trump and the neo-cons in the deep state
they care so deeply about these Syrian
civilians really they care deeply about
civilians is that why Donald Trump
wanted to ban Syrian refugees he cares
so much about these people that he's not
gonna let any of them into the country
stop like this is [ __ ] it's you're
spitting in our eye with the lack of
logic here Donald Trump brags about
torturing he said it at the State of the
Union that he signed a pro torturer
executive order that guy who likes to
torture people that guy who likes
extrajudicial prisons that guy who said
repeatedly he wants to take out the
families of terrorists meaning kill
civilians and Middle East that guy now
you have liberals and Democrats who are
begging that guy to do humanitarian
intervention well how the [ __ ] can a guy
who doesn't have a humanitarian or moral
bone in his body do a humanitarian
intervention
it makes no [ __ ] sense that makes no
sense and then also the u.s. is
currently involved in a genocide in
Yemen were aiding or abetting were
funding a genocide in Yemen we arm Saudi
Arabia and we bomb with Saudi Arabia
mosques hospitals open-air markets
schools their block hating the country
they're not allowing in food so millions
of people are starving there's a cholera
outbreak which is totally preventable
but we're not allowing in the medicine
to cure it so as we are flat-out
assisting a genocide we pretend like Oh
so much about civilian casualties well
there's an easy way to stop terrorism
stop participating in it so you stop
arming Saudi Arabia you stop arming all
these you know irrational dangerous
actors in the Middle East including
Israel by the way there's vicious
oppression of Palestinians going on on a
regular basis so you want to you want to
help human rights around the world stop
arming insane regimes the u.s. supports
73 percent of the world's dictatorships
so you can't say we care about democracy
and freedom and human rights when that's
the reality you can't say you care about
civilian deaths when you know the ROE
hinga Muslims are being massacred
there's a genocide going on there - in
my anmar and what's the reaction from
the US [ __ ] crickets now I'm not
saying we should get involved in that
instance I'm not saying we should get
involved in any of these instances the
only time we should use unilateral force
is when there's a director at a violence
against us now if you want to talk about
the international community getting
involved in the sense that we have the
UN get involved and you want to do
humanitarian aid you want to do genuine
defence in situations not of a civil war
but of a genocide then I'm with you and
everybody's with you everybody's in
favor of humanitarian aid everybody's in
favor of actual defense of communities
that have zero ability to defend
themselves when it's a legit genocide
like roaming the Muslims for example but
what we're talking about here is
unilateral United States military force
to get involved in the middle of a civil
war we're in one side is somebody we
call a brutal dictator and the other
side is primarily jihadists and hardline
Islamists what the [ __ ] would we get
involved in that for well the answer is
power geopolitical dominance and control
money natural resources this is what
goes into our decision-making in all
these different conflicts that's what
goes into it if you are really naive
enough to think well I mean come on this
is more about human rights well then you
I mean that's like comical at this point
if you think that I mean if you're
ignorant on the issue
and you're you know you haven't looked
into it yet like the history of the
United States and and what we've done
with our foreign policy we've been at
war ninety-three percent of our history
did you know that 93 percent of USSR
we've been at war so you know if you
happen to believe like every time we do
anything it's for human rights and for
freedom and democracy well then you just
need to learn the history of the United
States and then you go okay so that's
[ __ ]
but I mean if you don't if you think I'm
wrong
the fact is you're empirically incorrect
like we we know as a matter of fact
you're incorrect so don't even so here's
the thing there are some people who
genuinely want to be humanitarian
intervention estándar those people that
they're wrong is that listen you're
being used like your goodwill as a human
being is being used it's being exploited
you're a useful idiot you're a puppet to
an establishment that has no interest in
protecting civilian lives but uses that
as moral cover to dominate the world in
an imperialistic fashion okay so again I
just told you if you want to do genuine
defense and you want to do humanitarian
aid where there are actual genocides
going on sure I think everybody would
agree to that but when you talk about
unilateral US force well you talk about
getting in the middle of a civil war I
right-wing pundit Tommy Lauren broke
with Trump on the issue of Syria I'm
absolutely floored by this because her
whole stick has been you know rush
limbaugh ask in that it's like
Republicans are always right about
everything and Democrats are always
wrong about everything so the fact that
she disagree with him on anything is
already a shocker but the fact that it's
over Syria is like wow okay that's so I
do have to give her credit for this even
though she's wrong about like 97% of
issues she's one of a grand total of two
main stream media voices that has
dissented on this issue which is beyond
pathetic because the other one is tucker
carlson so the hashtag resistance media
everybody on MSNBC and CNN mum's the
word on another offensive war against a
country that didn't attack us that could
potentially escalate towards World War
three because Russia is saying we'll
shoot your missiles out of the sky and
Trump is saying okay then I'll respond
so it's unbelievable but yes Tucker
Carlson dissented and Tommy
Lauren dissented check it out it's time
for final thoughts wouldn't it be nice
if we could remove ash are all Assad
from power unify Syria keep Isis and al
Qaeda out and tamaranian influence in
the region yeah it sure would but this
is the real world and the last thing we
should do is continue our involvement
another Mideast disaster yes the latest
chemical attack in Syria was horrific
tragic and despicable as Americans we
feel for the Syrian people but the cold
hard truth is this isn't our battle it's
not our war and we will not win it don't
get me wrong we have the greatest
fighting force on earth in the US
military but we can't win a war we don't
even know what victory looks like
overthrowing Assad doesn't solve the
problem not even close
this conflict is less about overthrowing
a savage dictator and is now more about
a struggle among branches of Islam that
goes back more than a thousand years how
do we win that how many times will we
keep sticking our fingers in the fire
before we realize that spreading
democracy in the Middle East does not
work how many times must be attempt to
pick winners and
losers in a civil and tribal war we do
not understand we've given the so-called
moderate opposition in Syria weapons
funding and training not to mention the
support of American troops one of whom
was just recently killed there that's
the spilling of American blood sweat and
tears and for what so a year down the
road those same US supplied weapons can
be used against us
we've been down this road too many times
that enough is enough yeah as a
Christian I pray for the victims in
Syria but we have enough problems here
at home when are we gonna put Americans
first what are we going to fight for our
own interests and protect our own
country we've got crumbling
infrastructure an opioid crisis veterans
dying in the VA health care system and a
border that's barely a border at all how
can we save the world we can't even save
our own backyard it is my hope President
Trump will stick to his plan and pull us
entirely out of Syria intervention has
so far been the status quo in this
administration has certainly continued
u.s. involvement but this president was
elected to break the status quo we have
nothing to gain in Syria and everything
to lose we cannot afford to lose more
Americans and someone else's unwinnable
conflict period
president Trump please remember it's
America first
those are my final thoughts feel free to
disagree from la god bless and take care
it [ __ ] breaks my heart that I have
to do a segment where I give Tommy
Lauren credit it breaks my heart and it
shows the abysmal failure of MSNBC CNN
the nightly news and every so-called
liberal left-leaning outlet out there
but this is where we are now some people
point out and this is true to an extent
they say well you have to be clear that
the reasoning and how these people come
to their non interventionist position is
different than how a lefty comes to
their non interventionist position so
it's not exactly the same thing that's
true you know like for example another
person who is against this conflict I
saw some of his statements on it stefan
molyneux the the libertarian ish you
know youtuber he points out like okay
well this is gonna increase the the
refugee crisis and you know there is a
strain of argument that comes from these
kinds of people that has a tinge of
xenophobia and bigotry to it where it's
like well I mean listen don't destroy
don't get involved and destroy these
places because then you just speed up
you know the hoard of of migrants coming
to the west who are gonna take away the
white majority so like yes there are
there are aspects of the argument that
they make that it's like of all the
things to point out about why we
shouldn't intervene that's not even on
the list but either way listen at the
end of the day what's the old saying
about a broken clock a broken clock is
Right twice a day
yeah and when it's right it's right so
the point remains and I don't give a
[ __ ] if there's some sort of an alliance
between the actual left and you know
paleo conservatives or
libertarian-leaning conservatives as
long as we actually achieve our goal of
not going to war then that's what you're
supposed to do how many times did Ron
Paul and Bernie Sanders back when Ron
Paul was still in office how many times
did they work together I think a decent
amount right and I think you know Rand
Paul and Bernie sometimes work together
now whether it's on criminal justice
reform or drug issues or whatever so yes
we have to not [ __ ] do this
but Trump used to say it himself how
many times did I pointed out I showed
his tweets his tweets were plain as day
what I'm saying is we should stay out of
Syria
you know it's stupid why are we wasting
blood and treasure and all that stuff
and Tommy actually makes a decent point
here she says we can't win a war when we
don't know what victory looks like now
notice it's never it's never talked
about in the mainstream media they
always like do the cheerleading for the
war they do the propaganda for the war
but they never they never explained like
and then that's why once we achieve goal
X we're gone we're out of there they
never say that they never say that they
just talk about it in a way like we have
to do we have to do we have to do it and
then there's no
and oftentimes what happens is like with
Libya they do all the propaganda to lead
up to the war the war happens then
sheesh all the people who had bleeding
hearts for Libyans all the poor Libyans
now they have nothing to say
they haven't written about Libya since
the u.s. toppled Gaddafi and there's
[ __ ] open-air slave markets in Libya
right now so the people who are so
concerned about the Libyans the Libyans
we have to save the Libyans now that
there's open air slave markets there as
a result of our misguided intervention
there like Shane also say so spare me
man notice they don't talk about the
fact we're even in Iraq and Afghanistan
anymore in mainstream media I mean there
are people I've gotten comments uh you
know people who listen to the show who
say hey I was born you know in 2001 when
we went into Afghanistan we've been in
Afghanistan my entire life I'm like holy
[ __ ] that's that's crazy and that's true
and then you know they point out the
media never talks about it
but never talk about under all-out war
in Afghanistan in Iraq nobody talks
about it
bombing eight different countries nobody
talks about it and they never say ask
somebody who's in favor of these wars at
this point define victory so when do you
get to plant the flag and go alright
we're done let's go home they don't have
an answer for you because listen what
was the original point when they said
we're going in Africa into Afghanistan
we got to get Osama bin Laden we got to
go to son Mellon well guess what [ __ ]
he's been dead for a while now hasn't he
mission accomplished get your ass home
but it's mission creep it's moving the
goalposts and it's moving the goalposts
because the real reasons why we're there
are not the reasons they said see that's
the part where they go oh that's
conspiratorial is it is it
conspiratorial when the US arms and
props up 73 percent of the world's
dictatorships when we've been at war 93
percent of our history when you look at
everything that we've done specifically
post-world War two you look at how many
times we've overthrown Democrat
democratically elected leaders and put
in fascist puppets it has nothing to do
with humanitarianism it has nothing to
do with any of that it has to do with
natural resources and geopolitical
dominance we act like every imperialist
power ever we just have a better [ __ ]
talking game to cover it up so with
Afghanistan they said we got to go get
Osama bin Laden and then we got a some
long time ago but we're still in
Afghanistan why like oh wow we have to
get al-qaeda okay but look it up even
bacterin but as far as like 2008 2009
there were less than a hundred al-qaeda
operatives in Afghanistan so why the
[ __ ] are we still there and then finally
they move the goalposts to we got to
defeat the Taliban okay so now we're
there and fighting the people who didn't
attack us on 9/11 funny how that works
you started out saying we got to go to
sama bin Laden we got him then II think
we got to get get out Qaeda we got them
now you say the Taliban well guess what
the Taliban [ __ ] controls what is it
60% of Afghanistan right now so you're
not gonna win that you're not gonna win
that this is the same [ __ ] this is
endless war they're fighting a guerrilla
war in their own country against the
United States just like in Vietnam so
you can't win that but that's the point
they don't even want to win it because
what is it in Afghanistan specifically
it has to do with probably opium but
also with minerals minerals trillions of
dollars worth of mineral wealth are in
Afghanistan and we're still there gee I
can't figure out why that is when it
comes to Iraq of course oil is a giant
part of it when it comes to every one of
these interventions the
military-industrial complex has a lot to
do with it
the war is very profitable for us for a
tiny class of elites and those elites
are always making the decisions when it
comes to Iraq what happened they said
well Saddam is responsible for 9/11
turns out he wasn't that was [ __ ]
but that was the original argument why
we were there we invaded on those
pretenses that was the argument that was
the premise we got to go in because
Saddam was responsible for 9/11 well we
found out that that was a complete and
utter [ __ ] then they just moved the
goalposts well Saddam has weapons of
mass destruction whoa whoa you just said
he was responsible for 9/11 now you're
saying okay okay he's not responsible
for 9/11 so there you go your whole war
rationale is out the window so what the
[ __ ] you're doing there come home come
home the second we learned that was
[ __ ] all the troops should have been
out the next day the next day cuz you
lied to us to get us into the war that's
a lie or at the very least is just
fundamentally untrue so you gotta say
okay let's go home but they didn't do
that you just move the goalposts and
then they move the goalposts again and
their argument was okay fine he doesn't
have WMD
here's no wmds but he's a bad guy oh
he's a bad guy he's a bad guy and that's
what they're doing with Syria now - Oh
Bashar Assad's a bad he's a bad guy are
you four bad guys I can't believe you're
four bad guys no it's that they're not a
direct threat against us we're supposed
to use our military unilaterally for
defensive purposes there are a lot of
bad guys we're arming and propping up
bad guys what the [ __ ] do you think the
Saudi Arabian government is what do you
think the Israeli government is in
Netanyahu with illegal occupation
permanently
we're aiding and abetting a genocide in
Yemen right now and we have the nerve to
pretend like we care about civilian
deaths are you kidding me you want to
stop civilian deaths stop arming and
propping up Saudi Arabia's they Massacre
Yemen stop propping up 73 percent of the
world's dictatorships this stuff is it's
unbelievable that they're still trying
to pull the wool over our eyes
but now even people like Tommy Loren can
see through it they never tell us what
victory looks like because that's not
the actual goal the goal is geopolitical
dominance and natural resources and
continuing our imperialism and the main
point that I think really really cuts
through and gets and gets people who are
on the left on the right just all
throughout the US the argument that's so
overwhelming to anybody who hears it is
this and she pointed it out
we're wasting how many trillions of
dollars over there and meanwhile our
infrastructure gets a grade of D plus so
our infrastructure is crumbling it's
crumbling and you're saying we need to
go you know
rebuild Duma we have to go bomb Syria
bomb the Syrians to save the Syrians a
little bit of a weird contradiction
there we're gonna have to we're gonna
we're gonna save you if it means killing
every last one of you bomb the series to
save the Syrians but the idea is just
like in Iraq just like in Afghanistan
whether it's Kabul Kandahar Fallujah we
got to rebuild them we got to rebuild
Conda are you [ __ ] are talking
about rebuilding Fallujah or Conda har
you can't even rebuild Flint
Flint Michigan doesn't have clean water
Detroit is a mess our infrastructure
gets a grade of D plus you got to
upgrade everything you gotta upgrade the
levees the bridges the roads you name it
the airports everything's got to be
upgraded but instead of doing that you
want to waste everybody's tax money
overseas it's not just misguided it's
also for illegal offensive war crimes
war crimes and obviously I don't even
need to bring up to you guys that a guy
who brags about torturing and a guy who
brags about taking out their families
killing civilians on purpose it's not
the guy who's gonna lead a humanitarian
intervention so it really breaks my
heart that I have to sit here and give
credit to somebody like Tommy Lauren and
and Tucker Carlson but how pathetic is
that that's the state of the country
right now we're in the media climate
they're the only people who are bucking
orthodoxy and saying no this isn't a
good idea they're the only people so all
the so-called liberal media Rachel
Maddow Chris Hayes [ __ ] Lawrence
O'Donnell goddamn crickets I don't hear
anything Anderson Cooper Wolf Blitzer
where are you I don't hear anything
certainly nothing anti-war that's for
damn sure
and even the Democrats man the Democrats
listen Tulsi Gabbard was that was one
who tweeted against it it was one tweet
okay I've been going nuts the past few
days they don't do it don't do it don't
do don't do don't do it even politicians
who I deeply respect and who I have
voted for and would vote for in an
instance I haven't seen anything they've
said yet right now on Syria to be fair
to these politicians they have said in
the past like no I'm not a good idea
let's not get involved there but now the
voice is needed the most and I hear
crickets so everybody's got to step up
and by the way you're not even taking a
political risk you think you're taking a
political risk you're not this would be
leading a moral counter charge which
everybody wants everybody wants the
Democrats to be a giant anti-war voice
that represents the silent majority of
Americans but no they sit there quietly
most of them are sitting there quietly
because you know they're part of this
disgusting grotesque broken system they
they get paid by defense contractors
just same as the Republicans do they get
paid by Big Pharma for-profit health
insurance companies Wall Street
just like the Republicans do that's why
some of them are silent other ones are
silent jizz because they don't know
politically if it's the right move to
make it is it is go speak against the
war speaking answer right now
hello everybody do deal so I like how
because the angle of the camera is a
little different for you Cory kind of
looks like you're like a porn could be
shot in that room there might have been
something I'm skint this is my guest
bedroom is where all the magic does not
happen maybe for guests
hopefully not I would not do you think
that's the thing you think guests go to
people's house and like they wanna okay
we should try and bang in the guest room
I feel like it's maybe split like 50/50
type thing cuz I mean I think some
people would be like come on like we're
at we're at Craig's house like we can't
this isn't our house but then other
people it's the opposite reaction they'd
be like yeah that's like it's not
crossing the boundaries enough where
you're doing some like too rebellious
shoot but you're also like is a little
rebellious we're not in our bed you know
like so that's like it's a [ __ ] up
move if someone's your friend you do
that [ __ ] cuz like no one wants you see
eating on their sheets skating on your
sheets is the good is a good name for a
band
Skeets yeah that's all the siblings
national sibling day do you see that all

friends mothers look like Father's Day

far off from your joke thing of like
right ass cheek day this seems like so
irrelevant check while that calendar has
all that [ __ ] mm-hmm there's other
calendar like there's made-up [ __ ] that
like is just you like also today and I
hope if you look at today's date
hopefully it says national sibling day
but then someone also said it's like
national library workers day or
something like that what day it's the
what date is it the 10th oh you know
guess get this safety pin day that's the
10th that's the 10th yeah no one on
instagram is posting about that [ __ ]
because that [ __ ] is [ __ ] who has
anything to say about safety pins nobody
has nobody even has an opinion about
safety pins ever like that's omadd's
does everybody started posting pictures
of safety pins and they were just like
shout out to safety pins and then
there's this big political debate that
happens and like Republicans are like
we're against safety pins fuck'em and
Democrats are like safety pins are
really great because they're like they
keep things safe safety pins are
actually pretty important to like
wardrobe sometimes like there's it's
such a like item that you don't think
about that much but if you're at a
wedding or you're like trying some [ __ ]
on or something pops off like your pants
or some [ __ ]
safety pin is very important like you'll
always hear someone say like does
anybody have a safety pin and I ridges
like why the [ __ ] would someone have a
safety pin I don't know I'm sure I have
at one time or another warrant a safety
pin but I I can't recall any
I've ever worn a safety pin yeah neither
can i but I feel like I have lost so I
feel like like something on my pant like
maybe my zipper broke or something or
that shirt needed to be something happen
yeah that's some [ __ ] I feel like
there's a chance that like my sister's
graduation back in the day my mom was
like hold on the thing is not fitting
right and she'll put a safety pin
somewhere yeah I got problems happen
it's a little like motherly thing to
carry though is the safety pin not carry
with her but we could have been at the
house and she was like I'll use the
safety pin no but I'm saying like it's
such an old-school thing for any person
above I don't know I feel like 35 42
even haven't like yeah I know how to use
a safety pin well it's the same [ __ ]
with like like having butterscotch
candies like if you have butterscotch
candies at your place you're above 60
yeah there's certain things that just
don't get passion or like my wife knows
how to do this which I'm pretty
surprised but like sewing you're either
like working at like I'm not even gonna
say you're either old-ass lady who knows
that it's so like a blanket or you're
like a tail or at like some spot on the
corner you know you like em in people's
pants or something you're talking about
sewing clothes [ __ ] she knows how to sew
clothes [ __ ] no so like sewing sewing
and knitting is what I meant so anything
okay yeah well I know Lillith knitting I
know little really it's yeah she likes
knitting oh it's very relaxing and like
I'm sure listen Manning I'll tell you
I'll tell you what my grandma on my
dad's side was uh she actually did she
actually sewed but he didn't just so
like close stuff or whatever and she
didn't just do knitting like oh notice
what I don't think she did knitting but
she would do these things she'd buy at
the store these things that are like
these pictures that you make with sewing
like you take a little needle you take
the thread you follow the directions and
you make pictures and they were so
[ __ ] good like she was so good at it
that I literally have some of those
things some of her pictures back from
back in the 1990's hanging at my place
so what did she do with the picture so
it's I really don't know how to describe
it but like I think if you go to go to
the store or went to the store back in
the day whatever store she went to I
don't know I feel like it's like yes
there's caldor's or some [ __ ] back in
the day
mm-hm and like there would be these
things like you know how for like a kid
they have like coloring books and you
can get it and then you color in the
lines and [ __ ] like everybody knows
coloring books this is like a little
sewing kit I guess where you buy it and
it had it and you can sew onto this
piece of fabric a picture basically and
she would sew like you know like a
bouquet of flowers or whatever and you
have to like follow the directions and I
think I know maybe it's called
needlepoint what she did whatever it is
it's like a version of sewing yeah I
think I think my wife's mom just did
that she put a teddy bear on like some
blanket [ __ ] yes it's in like that
except I'm talking about it would be
like a little there's like a wooden
frame it could be in a circle or a
square yes yes yeah and you plug through
yes exactly yes exactly was doing that
just the other day and son that [ __ ]
like that's she was nasty at it my
grandma like she was so good that like I
told my mom you know back a while ago
listen I want some of her her stuff like
it was so good that I want to hang that
up you know and I have a bunch of it
hanging so I was that impressed by it
and I remember when I was a little kid
she was like trying to teach me to do it
and like I did it for a little bit but I
was buns I didn't know how to do it like
good but I was always so like I loved
her [ __ ] it was really good art and
it was impressive but and all that [ __ ]
like what stands the test of time too
like it's a trait that it's not like
video games where you can be like push
this button like it's something that's
actually like tangible like you're
making you're making art and that [ __ ]
that shit's getting passed down for sure
exactly 100% it's getting passed down
cuz I guarantee you you know if I were
to show my niece and nephew when they're
older they'd be like that's like that's
that's nice like it's regen you 'only
nice you know yeah but like that's
[ __ ] for your grandma that was like her
gameboy or some [ __ ] like that was like
what they did with their friends they
did call up my homies and was just like
you want to go to the park and [ __ ]
do this [ __ ] well that's what they would
do yeah it would be honestly on some
like southern type [ __ ] where she would
like sit in the on the front porch with
her with her little lawn chair and she
would just show them so this [ __ ] the
needle yeah and it's like that's him
those are like the stereotypical [ __ ]
you see of like a grandmother like when
you're running in the house and yeah
he's in a rocking chair just like yeah
what it was okay son before we even keep
talking we have to do the poles cuz we
keep forgetting to do them true that so
let's let's jump right into this [ __ ] I
jotted down or I put into my notes to
the poles okay first one shaving cream
versus shaving gel mm-hmm I think that's
a good pole and I'm team shaving cream
by a mile and a half I think I'm cream
too but I think that's just because I
was exposed to shaving cream like that
was the only [ __ ] I bought because I
wasn't educated enough on shaving gel
like if someone had exposed me to
shaving gel first that might be my thing
but since shaving cream is just like
universal with shaving mm-hmm that's why
I think I like shaving cream do you
think he'll be better do you think
people are gonna pick the gel or the
cream cream cream is gonna slaughter gel
I think okay that's a good that's a good
that's a good guess I think I agree with
that because for that reason I think
just because gel is just it's not it's
not that known in the shaving world and
I could be wrong I'm not like a I'm not
a beard yeah I don't agree with it I
think people know about the gel you
think so yeah I do because it's it's I
feel like it's it might even sell more
because I think the cream is more
expensive is it yeah and like who wants
to know what am I gonna call out for
[ __ ] shaving like no I'll just get
whatever is cheaper and whatever cheaper
is the shaving gel I feel like the cream
is is cheaper like they used to have
those Barbasol shits for like I thought
those were more expensive to borrow
first I could be wrong I remember there
was this gillette gel that my dad got
back in the day and it was like he got
like a huge pack from costco and it was
so cheap and i I was using the cream and
I was like I compared the price and I
was like damn the gel is so much less
expensive I just always feel like the
gel it feels like colder when it hit
your skin which is nice but it doesn't
give the same like I don't know the
cream something feels great about the
cream yeah the shaving cream yeah it's
just like all moist on there and like I
think I'm squeezing the cream is better
to just that like people are definitely
gonna take that out of context but yeah
that's true that's definitely sound of
just like it's just like a big
marshmallow just fine no and all you
have to do is like tap it and it's a
decent amount comes out I don't know
about you but I always put too much oh
yeah and then I end up just watching it
on to like 75% of it I have to wash off
and then I just used the tiny little bit
oh okay so shaving pole we got shaving
cream shaving gel let's do it
okay next poll is um I keep picking up
the wrong [ __ ] Oh classic Street Fighter
verse Mortal Kombat verse Tekken oh yeah
that's a good I think didn't we do
something with Mortal Kombat one time
and Mortal Kombat slayed I think mmm
did we I don't think we did cuz I feel
like I was surprised by the answer I was
like oh me Mortal do you do that poll I
think so because Mortal Kombat won and I
was I was surprised because I was
talking about they had a movie or some
[ __ ]
and I thought Street Fighter had a movie
too but it definitely didn't do as well
as um as a Mortal Kombat [ __ ] yeah we
you're right we did do this poll for
sure where we did so I remember we had
this conversation and I feel like if
they did a Street Fighter movie again
one no one would know about that [ __ ]
but the rock would definitely be in it
because that
the [ __ ] is on my Instagram timeline
in every [ __ ] movie that's in the
theaters right now he's some world
premiere he's in this the new one
rampage where he's like fighting like a
big monkey or gorilla I I was inspired I
looked up his work out you know regimen
yeah why the [ __ ] am i blanking on that
word whatever I worked I looked up his
workout and he works out six days a week
four days a month an hour and a half to
an hour and 45 minutes a day yeah he's
he's on a different level and he says
well I mean I think he's roided the [ __ ]
up but he thinks oh yeah for sure
but I mean it's still like that's still
amazing still like holy [ __ ] and he said
like this is my this is my like Zen time
this is my [ __ ] you know
antidepressant this is my everything
like that's his time but I was like damn
that's a lot of working out man six days
a week goddamn yeah he's all about that
[ __ ] he travels he traveled to Tokyo or
some [ __ ] and the first thing he did
when he land was work out mmm
I mean I give him props but it's also
when you make your own like schedule and
[ __ ] like that when you have that much
money like you can do that [ __ ] like
yeah but his he's one of the busiest
[ __ ] people there is but the thing is
he genuinely enjoys it that's the thing
like most people look at a workout and
they're like oh I gotta [ __ ] do this
[ __ ] and get out of the way but he
genuinely is like I can't wait to get in
the gym you know what I new I think it's
I don't know I still think it's easier
for him with like no worries whereas
someone who knows just work and [ __ ]
yeah yeah no financial worries that's
for exact somebody who's working a
full-time job who's just trying to keep
the [ __ ] lights on you know I worked
out at 5:30 in the morning and then
we've got kids and [ __ ] families and
it's like what do you like you have to
[ __ ] get dinner like what do you what
do you mean you're gonna go work out
like you have to buy dinner and we have
a child here I mean so we can't [ __ ]
go to a gym for an hour and a half every
[ __ ] day and way it's hard it's hard
man for sure but I was inspired
his [ __ ] but then again no he's
definitely an inspiring [ __ ] dude
he's getting that [ __ ] chemical
assistance for sure I remember back I
you know I used to did you ever take it
to I just take creatine back in the day
I never did creatine I did casein at
night which was like that's low protein
yeah yeah the other protein but the
casing like got you bloated right
creatine you mean creatine yet yeah
creatine it makes you retain a lot of
water weight so you feel like you got
huge gains but really you're just kind
of bloated basically but it definitely
made you look like bigger and the
argument is it also makes you like it
makes you work out a little harder I
guess that was you know I kind of felt
like that
for me the thing that I feel like the
pre-workout drinks helped the most but
they were straight-up drugs
hell yeah they there used to be so many
people in the gyms that would do that um
co4 or something like c4 it was like you
know when you're talking about I'm a
ready gainer
I used to take I think it was called I'm
looking it up sounds like that sounds
like the middle step between like just a
regular condom and like like the regular
Magnum
I think I'm [ __ ] it up it's not
Magnum it's green like the Johnnie
Walker Black but then like just like the
Johnnie Walker green label like your
dicks alright you can't get the Magnum
yet but you get the Magnum greedy okay
so slope I can't find that one it was
green something that I used to take the
pre-workout drink that she had tasted
delicious and made me [ __ ] beast in
the gym and then the one I used to take
the one I took after that is the one
that everybody was taking jack like this
Jack throw yes for the [ __ ] yeah and
that's probably been banned that's a
throwback yeah they've probably been
banned now if it was banned they
definitely made some modifications what
they do the same shoe see a lot of
people don't know when you go to like
vitamin shop or whatever and you buy
some [ __ ] pre-workout [ __ ] like it is
actually the case
that in some of the [ __ ] that you take
from there you you're taking steroids
and what happens is they catch them with
the steroids they ban that one and then
you re release a different product that
has that [ __ ] in it and it's just again
it's a it's a game of cat and mouse it's
just like here's some [ __ ] steroids in
this [ __ ] oh sorry that one's banned
well here's a new one that's not doesn't
have steroids and that one's on the
market for a year and then that one gets
banned and then they do one but jacked I
like I remember after I had been I had
been using it for a while and again it
gets you [ __ ] pumped and you go in
there you really do workout much harder
but then I saw an article that was like
talking about how people were taking
jacked and then going to clubs because
like it got them so [ __ ] high but
it's not a bad idea and then I was like
damn like it hit me at that point I was
like oh I'm I'm just like taking a drug
before I workout like I'm taking a drug
it's basically like I'm taking caffeine
mixed with like three or four other
things that make me feel [ __ ] up and
awake and then I was like it's probably
not a good idea for me keep taking this
[ __ ] yeah but I'll tell you what man I
can say for sure it's definitely not
healthy to take those things but it
might your workouts are a lot worse when
you don't have something like that in
you like your workout you're just not as
strong you're not yeah like I distinctly
remember my workouts when I stopped
taking it and I was like god damn I you
normally would easily be able to bang
out you know whatever four sets of ten
with this [ __ ] and I'm struggling to get
to [ __ ] eight on my first set yeah
that's when you start getting addicted
to the [ __ ] and like relying on it you
know like when it's just like I mean the
whole purpose of working out is to be
healthy and feel healthy but if you're
working out on that [ __ ] that's mad
unhealthy for you it's almost like
what's the purpose of doing this [ __ ] so
you can get a couple more sets or we
want to do it normally without all that
[ __ ] like steroids I never understood it
like okay you're gonna look bigger and
all this [ __ ] but like the purpose of
working out is to [ __ ] feel good
and I guess so some people it's to look
good is more important well that's
welcome to the jungle come and suck me
off that was an interesting way to start
this how's everybody doing
we my [ __ ] is it okay so here we go
again here we go again with the fun
back-end stuff um let me hit refresh I'm
gonna pull it all up see how I can hop
on into the super chat sentence I'm not
gonna take them just yet I'll take them
in a little bit well we got a bunch of
stuff to talk about first so we're gonna
hop into that in just a minute here we
go
live control room holla at you boy
already demonetised whilst you expect
okay there everybody is hello everybody
hello hello hello how was everybody's
Sunday yesterday for me it was a it was
a great day because I felt like a kid on
Christmas because of the the lineup of
what I got to watch so there was the
Masters everybody knows I'm a golf geek
the Masters was on [ __ ] love watching
the Masters um I have to go one year
I've never been there the tickets are
super duper expensive but I know a
friend of mine from when I was growing
up as a golf pro now not a touring pro
but a golf pro like teaching pro so he
might actually be able to get me on the
course for uh not to play unfortunately
but to watch the Masters so I was
watching the Masters yesterday that was
a lot of fun I just loved that
tournament so much it's my favorite golf
tournament of the year and man Jordan
speith made a [ __ ] run at it holy
[ __ ] you want to talk about Sunday magic
that's the old Sunday magic that we used
to see from tiger and Phil back in the
day when they would make a charge on
Sunday I get so excited when that
happens it with Spieth I was like holy
[ __ ] when he made that putt on 17 me and
my friend were texting each other we're
like he's like what the [ __ ] Spieth is
trying to be the next Tiger
now you can't compare anybody to Tiger
cuz Tigers tiger and tigers like barely
human
but Spieth was trying to be the next
Tiger it was amazing
so the Masters I watched then after that
I watched WrestleMania WrestleMania was
uh it was okay I'm a little upset
because my boy is Nakamura and Nakamura
lost
I always feel whoever I want to win
never wins when it comes to wrestling
but I think that's why that's they keep
me coming back like somebody said it
like you can't enjoy wrestling unless um
unless you hate every aspect of it like
the fact that we hate it is why we keep
watching because we're like hey maybe
I'll Ronda Rousey was good somebody
mentioned running around she was
actually really good and I was impressed
I was ready to [ __ ] on her and be like
she sucks who get her out of there she
was actually really good but yeah the
fact that I get mad every time I wash it
is probably why I keep watching it
that's that's probably just what it is
you are sexiest [ __ ] that is all carry
on wrong wrong but thank you I
appreciate that
so masters was great WrestleMania was
okay so it was a big it was a it was a
fun day for me yesterday I felt like a
kid on Christmas that's why there was no
actual live show today and I'm doing a
live stream instead because I was like
there's no way I'm gonna be able to prep
while I'm trying to juggle watching the
most awesome things ever so I decided
I'll just do a live stream instead and
we'll talk about what we probably would
have spoken about if we were gonna do a
show and I'm not gonna like clip it out
and everything but so there's a lot of
stuff going on and it ain't good it
ain't good at all so let me alright
let's just jump into the Syria thing I
feel like that's probably the most
important thing it's big on Twitter
right this second as it should be it
looks like we're about to get even more
mired in Syria well so we're already
there it's hilarious when people act
like the US and they're in action in
Syria in action my ass cheeks Obama put
us into Syria we're still there under
Donald Trump
the thing that's he probably most
infuriating well it's most infuriating
that we're there at all but we're
actually
arming and propping up both sides of the
war nobody talks about that I feel like
that's a giant scandal but nobody talks
about that so we you have Pentagon
backed rebels who are fighting CIA
backed rebels I mean that's it like
strike one you're out end of
conversation
what the [ __ ] are we doing what are we
doing so we're already there we were
there under Obama were there under Trump
but now so what happened is they are
claiming that Assad did a chemical
attack what they would say is another
chemical attack now the first time
around you know come and find out it was
[ __ ] they claimed he did a chemical
attack come to find out it was [ __ ]
it of course has not been proven there
is evidence of chemical weapons being
used but there's actually evidence more
evidence of the rebels using chemical
weapons than Assad using chemical
weapons so they tried this once before
and then they tried it a second time and
notice there's a really really really
clear line of events that happens
whenever it becomes apparent that Assad
has strengthened his grip on power and
he's defeated the rebels so whenever
it's like okay he's on the verge of
winning the war if not has already won
the war that's when you get all the
allegations of chemical weapons so now
again people don't talk about the fact
that Assad actually gave up his chemical
weapons you remember that remember when
John Kerry and you know a Russian
official we're doing a meeting and they
were trying to stop the u.s. from
intervening in Syria and the the Russian
official was like what can he do in
order for you to not intervene and bomb
him basically a new regime change and
John Kerry said well he could give up
his chemical weapons but that's not
gonna happen and then the very next day
Russian officials came out and Assad
came out he said fine here I take my
chemical weapons you could take him
don't care
didn't use them not using them now don't
care you could take them now again
nobody's bringing that up in the context
of this conversation because it's
inconvenient for the narrative and the
narrative that's being pushed by the
West now is even though Assad has
basically already won the war all my
goodness he decided to gratuitously use
chemical weapons against his own
civilians by the way the people that
they had freed from jihadist strongholds
recently so we're supposed to believe
that this this guy would do this totally
irrational action which would then spark
the ire of the West to possibly if not
certainly go in there and do a military
action directly against him so simply
put guys I don't buy it
I don't buy it I think the government's
lying to us I think the media is lying
to us and now I see every single outlet
you can imagine is contributing to the
war fever pitch at the moment and it's
maddening I even saw now I love the
intercept they do fantastic work and
Glenn Greenwald is actually a friend of
mine but I even they had an article
that's contributing to this to this
climate the same way that back for the
Iraq war Oh Saddam has weapons of mass
destruction Saddam has weapons mass
destruction Saddam has weapons of mass
destruction yet these goofy [ __ ]
stories about how in Iraq Saddam's
people would take babies out of
incubating cube aiders and throw them on
the ground insane
propaganda to try to get America to a
point where everybody goes oh yeah of
course we got to go in there what are we
waiting for of course we gotta go and
then also the idea this drives me crazy
nobody gives you contact nobody gives
you perspective the Washington Post had
an article like oh my god we really
should you know Trump is being Trump's
weakness is what led to Assad now using
chemical weapons against his own people
so again this is resisting from the
right this is why doesn't Donald Trump
be more aggressive more hawkish and why
didn't he stop Assad so in other words
the guy who just gave a State of the
Union speech where he bragged about
signing a pro torture memo Donald Trump
that guy the guy who says we should
quote take out the families of
terrorists the guy who doesn't have a
moral bone or humanitarian bone in his
body is now now he has the the so-called
liberal media pleading with him to go
intervene to go do military intervention
isn't that crazy
no matter what the arguments always end
up propping up the military-industrial
complex and propping up US intervention
and more empire more imperialism more
war so and this is the thing that it's
just unbelievable I would have if you
told me at the beginning of when Trump
got elected that Oh in a few months
you'll have or a few a year or so but
even within a few months people were
doing this that they would be begging
for Trump to be more hawkish and for him
to get more involved in Syria and it
would be Democrats doing it and
supposedly liberal outlets doing it I
wouldn't believed you and I'm jaded and
I'm cynical as [ __ ] but even I would
have said no that's not gonna happen I'm
gonna disagree a lot with the resistance
and how they resist but there's no way
that you would have overt calls for
bombings and interventions and remember
the last time when to Donald Trump get
the most a few civ praise from the
mainstream media when he bomb Syria he
bombed the Syrian the Syrian airport it
was like a military outlet and then you
had guys like Fareed Zakaria again who's
supposed to be a lefty goes out there
and he's like today's the day Donald
Trump became president Brian Williams
was talking about the beauty of our
missiles taking off and nobody's even
bringing up the fact that wait wait a
second don't aren't we supposed to have
a standard for when we do unilateral
military action is there supposed to be
a standard like okay we only do it in
situations XY and Z like here the here's
the plan we only do it for and of course
I would argue the most reasonable line
to draw is self-defense self-defense but
nobody's even bothering to make an
argument that well Assad's gonna attack
the US because everybody knows that's
just beyond preposterous Assad has well
what's the SOG in it seriously what
Assad tak
attack [ __ ] Kentucky is that what he
would do would he go after Arizona would
he try to do an invasion through Mexico
and ours are you kidding me and but the
thing is back churring even during the
bush years they felt like they needed
they needed to make some kind of
argument to that effect they felt like
they needed like Oh Saddam was connected
to 9/11 see he attacked us already so
that's why we have to fight back see
even back then
they felt like okay we need to give
something that would make your average
American who's actually thinking about
these issues when you bring them up to
those people you have to make them go
okay well it's understandable because he
attacked us on 9/11 so their propaganda
was built on well we have to make a case
that he attacked us or he wants to
attack us that's what they say all
weapons of mass destruction he's gonna
attack he's gonna launch he's gonna
launch it was all [ __ ] but they had
to make you feel like you were under
threat the United States was under
threat now we're at the point where the
military-industrial complex has taken
such a root in the in America's
political system where the Democrats and
the Republicans are both bought that
they don't even bother to make an
argument of like oh my god a solid
threat against us they say oh he killed
his own people and by the way again they
what did they is there an official
conclusion and an investigation that it
was you know Assad that used these
chemical weapons of course not and is
the same thing they did with the
situation recently with Russia where
they were like oh my god this guy was a
Russian spy and he was poisoned by the
government and so therefore what are we
gonna do we have to act we have to act
and that the UN the US was against an
investigation Russia was like okay look
do an investigation we'll do an
investigation whenever the investigation
comes - those are the conclusions the
u.s. blocked that and said no and then
of course we say our own intelligence
agencies go up say no but it was Russia
for sure will we're telling you it's
Russia so again the same people lied to
us about Iraq are now the ones who are
you know pounding the gavel and saying
nope same thing with Russia Russia's
poisoning their own people by the way
Russia is so brilliant at assassinating
these people that they survived and they
argued again that they used a Russian
nerve agent so they use the most easily
trackable thing back to them is that
what you know geniuses would do an evil
genius like Vladimir Putin he would
assassinate somebody by using the thing
where everybody would point directly at
Russia again I just need you guys to
think about this stuff and don't just
don't accept it at face value and I
can't stand the fact that nobody in
these conversations dares to bring up
the elephant in the room that everybody
else around the world would bring up
second number-one when we're having this
conversation which is who the [ __ ] are
we the United States government to say
were the moral are burgers and we're the
world police I just told you Donald
Trump was bragging about signing a pro
torture executive order he was bragging
about keeping guantanamo bay open there
you know there's a story that I'm gonna
cover on our next show about how some
top officials told him here's what we're
doing our drone strikes and we waited
for the civilians to leave in this area
before we did it and he said why'd you
wait you shouldn't wait so this
government the government that is but
currently bombing 8 different countries
the government that under the Bush
administration did an offensive invasion
against a country that didn't attack us
and killed minimum 200,000 civilians
this government is now gonna say well
obviously for humanitarian reasons we
need to do regime change in Syria so ok
by our own logic does that mean that I
don't know say Greenland can invade the
US and topple the US government because
of what we did in Iraq or because of
what we're currently doing in Guantanamo
Bay it's a fair question right I mean if
we're gonna have a standard the standard
is listen if you're a rogue regime and
you're violating international law you
need to be toppled militarily from a
foreign country
ok well then we should have been toppled
years and years and years ago but of
course the way propaganda works is you
do an arbitrary moral carve out for the
u.s. you go down oh it doesn't count
when we do it doesn't come when we do it
so we can't like Mulligan's non-stop you
know the same rules don't apply to us we
just declare we're above the game
everybody else has to play by the rules
in the game we're above the game so and
then listen at the end of the day what
it comes down to is might makes right
that's what the u.s. fundamentally
argues but then you don't get to you
know [ __ ] about other countries and
their humanity and their human rights
records because ours is absolutely
[ __ ] abysmal but we still have
supposedly liberal outlets begging
President Trump to intervene and they
just bought [ __ ] Bolton into the room
they just brought him into the
administration and now we're gonna see
the fruits of Bolton being there
listen man Donald Trump I can't I can't
[ __ ] take this Donald Trump so I look
it up because you know
and I know when it came to Syria excuse
me when it came to Afghanistan when it
came to Iraq his Twitter feed was just a
litany of what the [ __ ] are we doing
there this is so stupid
we're wasting so much blood and treasure
trillions of dollars we basically flush
down the toilet we're getting nothing
out of this he doesn't mention that
we're killing civilians over there cuz
he doesn't give a [ __ ] about civilians
over there but at least he was willing
to make the argument we should spend
that money here at home and rebuild our
country and why is why did Bush do it
and why is Obama doing it when Trump
campaigned in the debates he said the
same [ __ ] thing why are they doing it
why are they doing that this is so
stupid we shouldn't be doing this
non-stop he would just and again in
other ways he was hawkish you know in
other ways he said he wants to take out
the families of of Isis and terrorists
and you know so in some ways he's the
most hawkish but her other ways he's non
interventionist when he said let's not
go into Iraq let's get out of Iraq let's
get out of Afghanistan so I said you
know what let me check to see what the
deal was with Syria because I didn't
know hey maybe he was Syria he didn't
say anything about Syria for example or
maybe he was tepidly in favor of it for
whatever no guess what here I'm gonna
read you some tweets from Trump on the
issue of Syria he said and this is
September 3rd 2013 quote what I am
saying is stay out of Syria what
happened Don he said on September 13
2013 quote we should stop talking stay
out of Syria and other countries that
hate us rebuild our own country and make
it strong and great again USA he said on
September 9th 2013
don't attack Syria an attack that will
bring nothing but trouble for the US
focus on making our country strong and
great again
September 7 2013 President Obama do not
attack Syria there is no upside and
tremendous downside Savior powder for
another and more important day he said
on August 29th 2013 quote what will we
get for bombing Syria besides more debt
and a possible long-term conflict what
will we
for bombing Syria besides more debt and
a possible long-term conflict Obama
needs congressional approval so this is
[Music]
if we want to speak the language of
trumps own team here he's being cooked
by the deep state that's what it is he's
surrounded by the military-industrial
complex he's surrounded by bush Aaron
neo-cons and they are telling him time
and time again mr. president you have to
do something to stop this mr. president
we have to do regime change mr.
president we have to get involved in
this stuff we don't have a choice we
need to show the world that we mean
business and you couldn't get a worse
situation so now we have Bolton he wants
to [ __ ] attack North Korea he wants
to attack Iran he wants to probably do a
[ __ ] ground invasion of Syria is that
I think we would probably save time if
we just spoke about the places that the
United States doesn't want to invade I
mean this is getting [ __ ]
preposterous and then don't even get me
started on the Democrats ted Lieu was
just tweeting about this before mr.
president we think that I would like to
say that maybe he he all options should
be on the table okay there we go so all
options are there let me say maybe
military action maybe war why not maybe
Halla people we back how's everybody
doing I'm asking that expecting for you
to respond but nobody is there to
respond good good good good good
imagine like having to do this in front
of all the people that like like I just
showered and then I was gelling my hair
and I was like let me gel this [ __ ]
alright cuz there's some people watching
this [ __ ] but I am that's having to do
it in front of all these [ __ ]
yeah you kind of lose track of what you
like what's actually happening um I I
noticed that all the time when I when I
do my show it's like I'll just go
through the motions and my hair will be
[ __ ] up and let's be like alright you
got to go start the show but I don't
stop and go hold on now more people are
gonna see this than I've ever liked you
know mm-hmm whatever spoken in front of
in person ever by like eight times so
what why I do I not care enough it's
weird it's like we're not
psychologically evolved enough to grasp
it at all times you know what I mean
like you're right late if we were
sitting in front of an auditorium or
everybody who is gonna listen to this
we'd be like oh [ __ ] is my hair out of
place like that's nervous yeah we'd be
nervous we would try to look really good
and but since we're just used to doing
it like this we just don't think twice
about it yeah and that's why I like it
was mad funny when um I posted on
Twitter like someone was clowning me
they were like Coral coral looks like
his breath would stink first of all [ __ ]
whoever said that [ __ ] man cuz you're
probably right my [ __ ] is probably
usually stinking a lot but then like I
was thinking back to the one episode
where I were like so I try to get like
these hipster glasses this is whatever
it's I [ __ ] like I have one pair that
I'm okay with all they're like the
Malcolm X black yes but then there's
like a new trend and I like I was like I
could [ __ ] with that trend it was like
the clear frames yeah and um and I liked
them but like the pair that I got are
sort of a little suspect like they were
they were cheap I got them for like $50
sure so they don't look as good as some
of the people who are rocking the shit's
that look good so I had some like
Chinatown editions right and and like I
had them on on air the whole time and
before I was on air was like I rock
these shits
I was like partner whatever like it's
just me and Kyle talking but I didn't
read any of the comments or anything
like that but people were probably
clowning this [ __ ] I read some of them
oh yeah you know like that corner looks
like my grandmother and money but
they're just funny as [ __ ] but like if
someone had the balls to say that to me
in person if we were doing that [ __ ]
like public in person yeah I don't know
I feel like I'd take more offense to it
and be more insecure about I don't
really I don't think they even say it in
person person they wouldn't say it to
your face they wouldn't be like hey man
your glasses look like your grandma's
glasses they just wouldn't say anything
they'd just be thick you know they
wouldn't say anything and then later on
they'd say to like their girlfriend or
something like I don't like his glasses
don't they look like a grandma's glasses
or something yeah that's so true
but yeah like it's hard you know when
you're when people when people are
watching us it's you can't like take any
risks like even even just changing my
haircut slightly like my haircuts always
been kind of similar the whole time but
just changing it like a little bit
people are like what the [ __ ] is this
[ __ ] does haircuts [ __ ] and part
of it stems from they might actually not
like the haircut but the other part of
it stems from they don't like change
this has changed like if you change you
owe you change something no no no I
didn't [ __ ] sign up for you to change
some [ __ ] I click on your videos i watch
your videos don't try to throw a [ __ ]
curve ball at me and go and make it so
that you're not the Kyle that I
originally watch when I was watching
Kyle so don't try to change anything so
it's almost like they take it a little
bit personal like I don't know like what
are you doing why the formula was
working why are you trying to change it
and I could see that with like with the
with a platform or some [ __ ] like when
when Facebook or some [ __ ] tries to
switch it up OD I'm like yo why like
[ __ ] was work oh yeah that's the worst
is when they cuz they'll [ __ ] it up more
than half the time yep and some [ __ ]
where like you would always go to like
the top left to click on your
notifications now the [ __ ] will be like
a floating thing that pop and you just
like what the [ __ ] like now I gotta get
used to that and like plus whatever is
going on my life like this supposed to
be some [ __ ] that I'm just no it's yeah
it's complicated because they're making
those changes because they want to try
to stay relevant and be on the cutting
edge
be leading in whatever industry they're
in but at the same time everything's a
risk because if you change something you
risk taking away that thing that made it
good in the first place so and
Facebook's a great example that
Twitter's a great example that you know
I was how do you explain how do you
explain it sorry with like a human being
like someone wants to drastically like
you changing your hair or some [ __ ] like
I feel like that's okay oh it's
definitely okay but I'm just saying that
when people develop an intimate
relationship with you when you're in a
certain state if you change anything
it's like what the [ __ ] are you doing
like no it was okay before like you
shouldn't be switching it up on me when
I got used to you being like that like
that was the signature you look you know
what I mean but then the other thing is
given enough time people can look back
and go yeah that actually wasn't like a
big deal you know what I mean like
looking at my hair like oh they look
back is what it looked like and then
what it looks like now they might go oh
okay it what whatever it's it's whatever
it's this it's close enough and it is
what it is but at the time when you
change it it's like [ __ ] this and I feel
it too I'm not above it I'm not
describing it as like this is only other
people I feel that same [ __ ] sometimes
if you if you tweak something a little
bit I've [ __ ] went ballistic when when
Twitter changed it from 152 or what is
it 140 to 200 that's I mean that's a
[ __ ] big like that is going that is
changing what Twitter was though like I
could so I don't like it I don't like it
but I'm not I wasn't 100 percent correct
with how much I was against it like I'm
still against it like I wouldn't have
made the change but I thought it was
gonna make me literally not want to read
tweets anymore but it has yeah but it
hasn't but there is a line somewhere
right like they probably hit that exact
line of like if you go beyond this line
then you're everybody's writing like a
mini essays and who the [ __ ] wants to
read everybody's thoughts in a mini
essay yeah you know what I mean and I
don't know what's our second tired of
Facebook right yeah and I don't know
what percentage of the tweets that I
read are over the original character
limit cuz I don't think a lot of them
are
I think a lot of the people I follow are
very caught not that they think about
like oh I have to keep it under this
limit but they just do they just end up
doing it yeah I think the purpose of
Twitter I mean if you're trying to get
retweets or you're trying to get
whatever your goal is on Twitter I think
the less character is the better you
know yes your rule yes yeah like even
even jokes or something like that I feel
like if you can get it out in like a
shorter it's or anything it's with any
kind of communication it doesn't matter
what whether it's comedy whether it's
you know Twitter or what it doesn't
matter you even if it's like a legit
essay like tell me what you're trying to
tell me without fluff that's why
everybody's just like get to the point
you know like yeah I don't think it
always used to be like that either I
think there was a time when people
looked at the fluff as like a sign of
like high class or a sign of like
sophistication like oh the more flowery
words you put around the point you're
trying to make the more respectable it
is whereas now I think we're in the era
of the opposite where everybody kind of
agrees with us were and part of it
probably stems from we all have short
attention spans now because of the
internet like I definitely think our
attention spans have kind of regressed
because we really do get that instant
gratification and that happens with me
man like I'll notice at night I'll be
like on Twitter watching something on
YouTube on mute and then watching
something on TV with the sound on to him
and it's like I haven't three streams
going at all times and then literally
all you have to do is take away one of
them and I feel like I need that third
one so it's like I'm addicted to three
separate things at once and I'm getting
that constant flow of information and if
you tweak it just a little bit that
ruins the whole like system of
gratification their flight Twitter's
down or something and I'm just I got
this stream on YouTube and the thing um
it's like oh [ __ ] I'm not like I'm
missing something here so that's how
much we've like built up this need for
technology I think that I think that
only works with technology like the only
[ __ ] that
what can multi-task with is is that
situation like having the TV on having
your laptop open and scrolling through
your phone
but any other [ __ ] there's so many
things like when i park i gotta lower
the music i gotta like make sure like
I'm locked in paying attention to
barking I'm like if if I'm writing
something and my wife is like here you
can you um remember to go Bob I might
hold on like let me finish this [ __ ] any
other thing that involves one more than
one thing yeah I'm like I'm like no I
can't do it like it's too much of my
attention being drawn to some other [ __ ]
but you're right I could TV laptop phone
do you find it hard to focus on
non-technology [ __ ] cuz I do I find it
hard to focus on non-technology [ __ ] and
that might be because the technology or
it might not be because technology it
could just be how I am but like when I
read the articles for my show I have to
sometimes you're wrestling with your
consciousness you're like you gotta be
focused you gotta get through the like
I'll read half article and then boom I'm
back on Twitter it's like come on man
what are you doing buckle down read the
[ __ ] and read it right and highlight the
parts you need and copy and paste and
it's it's a it's a wrestling match I
mean some of that might be because it's
just the sheer number of the volume
articles I have to read but no I feel
like that happens from like the first
second third article is just like come
on [ __ ] focus read here he I think I
think Twitter and like the society we
live in now where everything is quick
quick quick tell it to me fast like you
know like [ __ ] us up because when I
was a kid I feel like I mean I didn't do
much reading but I would probably be
more prone to read through an article or
do some [ __ ] and not at first you know
jump be like how long is this article or
start thinking about when I could be
done with this [ __ ] but now when I see
an article I'll scroll first to see all
right that's doable and then like I'll
and then I'll read it you some there's
some [ __ ] articles that like you
[ __ ] scroll for every ranch and I'm
just like ditch this is unnecessary
these comes New York Times articles do
you do [ __ ] like that yeah you click on
it and it's like they start out like
it was a warm summer day in July and
you're like nope this one's not making
the cut like you're not you're trying to
sometimes they try to do that they try
to take a personal story and then like
weave it into a story about something
that's a broader issue and I'm and I'm
like no I don't I don't jive with those
kinds of articles I know again that used
to be the thing you had to do in fact
they used to tell politicians to do that
used to tell politicians you have to
make it you have to bring it down to
earth for people so you have to make it
about an individual and that's why you'd
hear in political speeches like in Iowa
I met a man named Ted yeah and they
would say [ __ ] like that and back in the
day that was like oh he's good he just
brought up Ted like he's telling us
about Ted today somebody does that and
it's me like next shut the [ __ ] up but
they all still do that [ __ ] cuz we know
you don't care about Ted like we know
you don't care about Ted you're [ __ ]
rich person in Washington DC you know
running for office don't lie to me and
tell me you care about say you don't
care about tell you don't know Ted you
don't care about Ted but if you have a
position on the actual policy issues
tell me what that position is that we're
interested in so in other words we're
interested in the macro picture not the
micro picture or at least that's the
trend and that's certainly the case for
me so whenever I see one of those
articles where it starts like that like
you know or it starts to immediately
tell about somebody's job or whatever
I'm like no tell me what the meat of
what you're trying to tell me yeah I
mean and so New York Times is shitty
like that
the intercept has a lot of good articles
but sometimes they'll hit you with one
of the longer articles and I'm just like
oh there was I mean every now and then
there's a payoff though one time I
pretty recently probably within the past
six months I did an article that was in
I think it was either New York Times or
Washington Post or something it was
about a guy and his insane experience on
living under US drones he was a US
citizen then he moved back to where he
he was originally from which is Iraq or
I think it was Iraq and drone them ended
up killing his family and then he tried
to come back and get [ __ ] but but
that was a long-ass article and it was
one of the rare times I read through the
whole thing and I was like damn this was
good but even then it was like when I
got halfway through she was a long
article I was like oh
wrap it up a little bit even though this
is interesting you know what I mean yeah
yeah that's why this shorter I agree
with you the shorter ones are like you
know they they capture my attention and
usually they just have the relevant
information in there and they you don't
need anything else and you I mean you're
forced to just get all your [ __ ] like
meat and potatoes in that article if
it's some shorter [ __ ] so it's like give
me everything that I that's why in
[ __ ] high school just be so pointless
to have these articles that were
mandatory like in college it got worse
but in high school would be like six
pages long
like like Rome area when they tell you
you have to write an essay and you have
to go you have to make it six pages
there's got to be XML worse you'd be
like requirement six to eight pages like
seven thousand blah blah blah words
meanwhile you're like I can tell you
what I want to tell you in a page
exactly and then college it was worse
you would have to do like twenty page
papers and forty page like whatever
just nonsense cuz it's just like the
teacher doesn't want to read that [ __ ] I
don't want to write that [ __ ] I'm gonna
end up putting a whole bunch of [ __ ]
in there that is just [ __ ] because
I'm trying to meet your [ __ ] I'm
trying to meet your standard if you had
the opportunity to go to trade school
would you have gone to trade school
instead of school school so would you
have like picked a career at let's say
for argument's sake at age 19 or 20 and
then went to school for that particular
trade and then basically gotten like a
guaranteed apprenticeship and then a
guaranteed job where you'll make let's
say 90,000 I don't think so I still
think the the mix of everything is good
you know like just just interacting with
someone who's a whatever like a Spanish
major some [ __ ] or someone who's you
know psychology major and I'm marketing
or something like that
just having that mix whereas if every
it's almost like a utopia if you're
going to some school that everybody's
doing the same [ __ ] and wants to do the
same [ __ ] because eventually you're all
gonna start clashing you're all gonna be
like going for the same jobs and you're
gonna start competing with each other
whereas you know when there's people
doing everything you could find you a
little niche like I got I would get away
from my [ __ ] Education Department
today they're all [ __ ] math you nerds
you know like yeah the way it works in
Germany they give people a choice they
say you could
school or you can go to college or you
can go to trade school and you could
like learn a trade and then those people
usually and kitten pretty decent jobs
right get out but you know you have to
pick something at a relatively young age
but again that's like a do slightly
different way of doing it we're here
it's almost like with what we have it's
almost like a free-for-all because it's
like when she once you graduate in most
cases you're just on your own hell yeah
you know what I mean like I remember the
feeling right when I graduated college
and it was like okay what's the next
step pitch there is no next step now
it's on you know it's like well what do
you mean now it's on me that's that's
ridiculous I've been through a structure
this whole pulpit this whole way up and
then now you're just gonna let me loose
like no you don't off the diving board
you didn't even prep me for not having
structure you gave me a structure and
now I'm out of the structure well then
how did me being in a structure prep me
for not having a structure yeah it was
just weird I was like wow this is crazy
and then you know like I felt
immediately like oh my college doesn't
give a [ __ ] about me now I'm out the
door
don't care I don't give a [ __ ] but I
would it's dead it is different with
Taco Bell commercial it is different
with with like trade schools though like
you that the whole point is to prep you
for an actual career inside yeah so I
think we should have that option here
I think it's right it's not a bad thing
to look at I just I agree I mean some
parents have to there should be courses
that are just like like the next five
years and not just assume that when you
graduate everybody gets a job because
that's not how that [ __ ] works you know
oh of course not in fact we graduated
into one of the shittiest economies
since the Great Depression yeah so and I
mean like there's parents I think are
starting to change their mindset now
where they're understanding like kids
are coming out and they still need like
another [ __ ] grace period of like
three to five years to still do some
[ __ ] job or live at home and do
whatever the [ __ ] they got to do all I
mean our generation we are the
generation took a long time to get out
yours truly was on fox news yesterday I
want to go ahead and watch the clip
again and then I'll give you guys a
breakdown of exactly what it was like
every step of the way I'll tell you what
it was like when I was in there in the
belly of the beast
and the Lions Den and I'll tell you guys
my experiences on air and off air and
yeah I'm just gonna break it all down
for you so let's take a look at the clip
well for discussion let's bring in our
fair and balanced radio panel joining us
now from Philadelphia Ritchie Olli and
self-described a liberal host Kyle
kolinsky gentlemen nice to see both of
you the president was tweeting that
yesterday this morning on Easter morning
before church also went on Twitter he
said this Mexico is doing very little if
not nothing it's stopping people from
flowing into Mexico along their southern
border and then into the US they laugh
at our dumb immigration laws they must
stop the big drug and people flows or I
will stop their cash flow NAFTA need
wall exclamation point
rich what do you think's going on here
the president didn't get funding for his
wall his base is upset and now we see
this sort of hardening of his line on
immigration
Leland happy Easter I think the
president has this unique ability Donald
Trump makes the blue states act more
blue what I mean by that is you take
Browns actions right pardoning people
including a kidnapper so that they don't
have to face deportation and you know
Trump knows he's never gonna win
California but he doesn't have to as
long as he can win Ohio Pennsylvania
Michigan and ask yourself this question
you know our blue-collar workers in
those states are they can aside with
Trump on this issue or Jerry Brown who
says you know what we're gonna pardon
you so you view that you view this sort
of as a purely political calculation by
the president to try and push things
okay and I'm and I'm just going out on
the limb here Kyle you probably agree
with that so when it comes to these
Pardons and commutations I think we're
having a little bit of a false debate
here because there were 56 pardons and
14 commutations and 95
percent of them were for nonviolent drug
offenders so good kind if you want to
say what III I'm not talking about the
pardon commutation I'm talking about
President Trump here is do you think you
think this is a political calculation on
his part that is your fellow friend here
rich said that you're that they're able
to the president is view this is a way
to sort of drive a wedge in Ohio
Pennsylvania Wisconsin does that work if
so how did Democrats try and counter it
perhaps it's a political calculation but
in all seriousness parts of what he said
in that tweet I hope are not political
calculations I wish he would pull out of
NAFTA NAFTA has absolutely destroyed
middle-class families all across this
country and President Trump talks a good
game on trade deals he often says that
he's going to stop doing the dumb trade
deals that hurt working families all
across this country but I've seen very
little action on that front in fact
there's been 83,000 jobs that have been
outsourced as under President Trump's
first year so I wish that a lot of this
wasn't talk but unfortunately it is okay
well this seems to have me entered into
some very different places than I
thought it would but we'll go ahead and
take a listen to the president today as
he headed to church take a listen the
Democrats they had a great great chance
we'll have to take a look but Mexico has
got to help us at the border they blow
right through Mexico they send them into
the United States can't happen that way
anymore all right Kyle same analysis
here yeah I mean I don't understand why
he frames this issue as a criminal issue
when it's just told you why he did which
is that he thinks it works well for him
in Ohio and Pennsylvania in other states
so the question is how would Democrats
try to counter that well I mean simply
they could point out the fact that
ninety nine point seven five percent of
dreamers are law-abiding citizens and
about 91 percent of dreamers work or go
to school so when you don't want to deal
to help the dreamers they don't want to
dock a deal can we just stop pretending
like the democratic party wants to solve
this problem before midterms you guys
have nothing else to run on but fear
fear of deportation so you want to keep
that that issue alive keep that dream
alive if you will now and you'd love to
keep it alive in 2020 as well because
the Democratic Party right now has
nothing because as Jerry Brown proves
and as Phil Murphy and New Jersey proves
where he's announcing one and a half
billion for illegal immigrants to fight
Trump it proves that they go to the left
the cookie left of their base and it's
not it does not play well with
mainstream voters the reaction always to
tweet every trouble is to go left they
go further left would go further left
the majority of the American people are
in favor of the dreamers and like I just
said over 99% of them are law-abiding
citizens and so this isn't a middle
class this is I want you said you just
said you wish who would go further left
I wish the Democrats would go further
left I wish the president would go
further left again like I was just
talking about Trump referenced NAFTA in
that tweet we got it I wish he would
pull out of NAFTA I wish he would go to
the left kid you're on the campaign
trail he went to the left on on war
issues he said he would get us out of
Iraq he said he would get us out of
Afghanistan he didn't do it was lazy I
wish he would do those things
and also now he's saying that major
change possibly in US policy is gonna
pull troops out of Syria a lot earlier
than we thought
rich Kyle appreciate it guys we got to
run thanks that means different guys all
right listen
I've now watched that interview about
three or four times and I want to go
ahead and tell you guys what my thought
process was now before I get to that
I'll tell you what the whole situation
was like in general now it is very
streamlined and industrialized I mean
you show up there's like literally three
or four different layers of security at
the building you have to show your ID
you have to show a special card that
they give you anytime you go from one
room to another the most interaction I
had when I was there was with the makeup
girl and she was very sweet very nice
they basically they basically put like
like peach paint on your face it didn't
even feel like they were doing makeup on
my face they took like the peach colored
paint and they slapped it on and then
they you know like colored ruin the
lines basically in my face and they were
talking about how oh we got to give you
a darker you know foundation than what
your skin color actually is because
those lights are so bright that if if we
give you the the same color foundation
as your skin you know it you're gonna
you'll come across as so white that it
won't it won't look good so they give
you a darker foundation so that under
the bright lights it evens it out and it
makes it look normal and then when I saw
on the I saw the result I was like oh
that's that's true it actually does make
me look relatively more normal since
they put the darker foundation on so she
was very helpful the makeup lady and so
uh this show is shot out of DC I was in
New York and so I was at their studio in
New York by the way I didn't see any
stars or at least any stars that I knew
I think there was one guy who I saw
going into the makeup room next to me
who's a host but I don't know who the
[ __ ]
is and when it came time to shoot the
the segment it's like I was brought to a
floor that was basically empty okay
there are a bunch of desks around and
stuff but it was basically empty there
was one dude there one dude it was
sitting like in front of a computer and
I was put in like the corner of a room
that was kind of cordoned off a little
bit and then I I sent a picture on
Twitter of what my view was like it was
you know you saw a few different
monitors in front of me and stuff and
the thing behind me I know it looks like
there's a whole like giant thing
happening behind me that was just a
regular TV screen it was about a 55 inch
maybe 60 inch TV screen and I think it
was showing a live feed of the main
floor in New York City so that that
thing that was happening behind me was
actually happening in the same building
I was in but it was from a different
floor and then recorded the segment and
then was done and that was that and so
all right now let's get to the segment
itself it's it's weird you know I have
obviously plenty of experience with new
media and now experience with corporate
media and all I can say is that
corporate media the debate feels
contrived
it feels streamlined it feels just like
industrial it feels detached and
disconnected I mean they they just
assure me into the room sit me down on
the seat and then the first time I ever
had a word with the host was literally
when he was like okay how do you put on
your name I was like Kyle kolinsky he's
like okay and how about you would
describe yourself as a secular radio
host I said no I describe myself as you
know you could say left-wing host he
said liberal host so he changed it a
little bit there but that was the only
you know conversation I had with the guy
when he was already on air just asking
me during the commercial break hey how
do you say your name and then boom we
start and we jump right into it and you
could tell the way that they do it is
it's a four-minute segment is what it
was supposed to be it went a little over
I got to speak for maybe a minute and a
half maybe two minutes max
but you could see what they're trying to
do there they're trying to say okay this
person's got to play the Republican you
have to play the Democrat and then you
do your partisan talking points back and
forth and you know they'll they
short-circuited when I didn't like
respond exactly in those partisan ways
and you could tell that they really
didn't know how to deal with it like the
host Leland was like well your were
meandering here in two places I didn't
think we would go and you know I wanted
to say that's what happens when you have
thoughtful people on who actually give a
[ __ ] about the issues and you don't have
[ __ ] bobbleheads or just spewing
talking points so you could tell what
they were looking for and you could tell
that I wasn't really delivering exactly
what they were looking for but it was
interesting to see their reaction to
that now the first the question was so
bizarre and now people were saying some
people were saying on Twitter like I you
you know you didn't really like answer
the question and then I was thinking
about it and guys the question he was
asking me wasn't even [ __ ]
registering in my brain because it's
just a weird question he asked is what
Trump's doing a political calculation
how the [ __ ] do I know what does that
even mean is it a political calculation
what do I have the ability to read
Donald Trump's [ __ ] thoughts I don't
know what the hell's going on in that
guy's mind and that's why basically I
didn't really answer that question and I
just started talking about the issue
itself
I saw I was like and by the way you guys
know me like every interview every
conversation I ever go into I have the
same [ __ ] thought process my thought
process is as simple as can be tell the
truth that's it that's all I think about
that's all I care about there's no
[ __ ] plan it's just be honest tell
the truth that's all that's the only
rule if that's your only rule in every
conversation you've ever had you're
gonna be alright and so I went into it
going I just tell the truth that's it
doesn't matter what the issue is just
tell the truth but when he asked me a
question and it looks like I don't give
a direct answer the only reason I wasn't
giving a direct answer is because their
question wasn't registering in my mind
cuz notice and here's the thing and
you'll see this a lot on corporate media
they
rarely talked about the issue itself
they talk about the people talking about
the issue see the difference so talking
about the issue itself is what do you
think of NAFTA what do you think of the
border wall that's okay let's talk let's
talk about the issue though about
immigration let's talk about those
Pardons and commutations that they were
talking about the Governor Jerry Brown
in California did let's talk about NAFTA
but they don't do that they avoid the
talk on the actual substantive issues
they want to talk about the people
talking about the issues so Donald Trump
can mention something about NAFTA or the
border wall a Democrat can respond to
that but you're not supposed to talk
about the actual issues you're supposed
to talk about what they said about those
issues which is just such a low level
you know it's a weird level of discourse
because it's just at no point do you
touch on anything that matters I don't
give a [ __ ] about what's going on inside
Donald Trump's mind I'm not a [ __ ]
mind reader I don't know if it what he
did or said was a political calculation
not a political calculation all I can
tell you is my thoughts on those
substantive issues that he touched on so
that's why it's like oh you did really
answer the question that's all I know
how to do is answer the question in a
policy substance way and you're asking
me a question that I don't have a
[ __ ] answer how the [ __ ] am I
supposed to know what was it a political
calculation was that even mean why are
we having this guy what a stupid
conversation to have so it was a weird
question so that's why I couldn't really
answer it directly now I started by
addressing the premise of the
conversation so in other words this is
how they set it up they said okay
Governor Jerry Brown did Pardons and
commutations
they talked about how oh my god they
were a violent formerly violent
criminals how dare he and so then they
take that set of facts they say Donald
Trump responded and ripped him and and
ripped Jerry Brown ripped immigration
and all that stuff and then hey hey what
do you [ __ ] Siri just went on sorry
about that
so they rip them and then they go hey
what do you think of Trump's motives in
ripping him so in other words obviously
Trump is right about the substance of
the immigration thing and and all that
but what do you think about him ripping
Jerry Brown do you think it's a
political calculation or is it not a
political calculation so in many ways
that's actually genius because what
you're doing is you're baking into the
premise of the question
well obviously Trump is right obviously
he's right about what he's saying but
the debate is not whether or not he's
right on the policy issues they changed
the debate to hey what are his motives
in being so right in slamming Jerry
Brown and that's why I basically kind of
rejected the framework of the question
and I went back to well no hold on hold
on here let's talk about these Pardons
and commutations that you're all
assuming are so evil and wrong and
terrible I looked at the Pardons and
commutations there were 70 in total you
know how many were of formerly violent
criminals three that means 95% of the
Pardons and commutations were of
non-violent drug offenders and not only
should they be pardoned that the state
should [ __ ] apologize to them and
they should pay them restitution for
ruining their lives over a nonviolent
drug offense which shouldn't even be a
[ __ ] crime in the first place
so that's what I was trying to point
that out like no no no 95% of these
Pardons and commutations are people who
shouldn't even been locked up in the
first place and then they didn't have a
chance to get to it but my next point
was gonna be and of the people who were
formerly violent criminals they've been
released from prison one of them was out
since 1997 another one was out since the
year 2000 and they've become model
citizens they're [ __ ] working now and
they got families and they're totally
rehabilitated and the only reason Jerry
Brown pardoned them is because they're
about to be deported so they were
formerly criminals totally reformed
totally rehabilitated that's a proven
fact it's been the case for decades they
picked out these people because they
were such upstanding citizens now and
they were gonna be deported so they said
pardon so now you're not gonna get
deported so this is a way for for
Brown and say [ __ ] you to Trump with his
hardline immigration stuff but this is a
rare instance where Jerry Brown is
actually right about something
usually jerry brown's kind of a
corporate ii democrat and i disagrees
them on a million things this is an area
where he's right and i was gonna get to
that point to that you're framing it
like these guys are [ __ ] you know
menace to society right now they're not
they're just that's not true so in other
words my whole point was attacking the
premise because they baked the premise
in and then they said whoa oh why do you
think Trump is so right is it a
political calculation or is it not a
political calculation what the [ __ ] is
that
so I attacked the premise of the
question that kind of you know sent them
off and then so the next thing I try to
do guys and by the way I'm just letting
you know this was all on a subconscious
level because I only have one rule when
I go into the all these conversations
just tell the truth but there was
something cooking up in the subconscious
mind there that was making me go in
these in these directions so the next
thing was he reiterated the question we
basically excited to answer the question
attacked the premise of the question and
then what did I say I said I wish some
of what Trump was saying is not a
political calculation because some of
that I agree with
he keeps huffing and puffing about NAFTA
[ __ ] pull out and after I want you to
do that I'm in favor of that now here's
why that's that was such a good move I
know I'm talking about myself here so
that I shouldn't be saying it like that
but I mean it because that worked even
better than I thought it would work
because after the interview I heard from
people who I know who are diehard Trump
supporters who were like you did great
you did great and I like what you had to
say now hold on you're these people are
diehard Trump supporters they're
Republicans and they came out of
conversation going
you did you did great you did better I
agreed with you more than the other guys
mission accomplished
mission accomplished so now we walk away
from that conversation going people on
the Left go well of course that guy was
right and now Republicans and Trump
supporters alike died agree with that
guy now
why it's all in the framing I'm not
going out there saying Donald Trump is
wrong I'm going to
Tucker Carlson and neocon John Bolten
had a debate on Fox News this is from a
few weeks ago but since then john bolton
has become one of trumps top foreign
policy advisors so this interview really
becomes all the more important and
insightful so let's watch and then we'll
come back and discuss Ambassador John
Bolton a frequent fixture here on Fox
was at the White House yesterday for a
personal meeting with the president
United States News reports a lot of them
suggest he could be the next national
security adviser so the following
question is more relevant than out than
ever what is ambassador Bolton think is
the greatest threat to America today
ambassador Bolton joins us to me great
to see ambassador glad to be here so it
feels like we're moving kind of in slow
motion toward a conflict with Iran and
Russia in Syria do you think we are well
I think that's one possibility I think
the Iranians have clearly gamed what
they plan to do after the defeat of the
ISIS territorial Caliphate I think they
were thinking of it when our strategist
were not thinking of it and we're now
suffering the consequences with Iran
literally on Israel's border flying
drones into Israeli airspace I don't
think that's the really most dangerous
aspect of the Middle East though I still
think it's Iran's support for terrorism
and its continued effort to get
deliverable nuclear weapon right so
obviously Iran was greatly empowered by
the fall of Saddam I think we in
retrospect we can concede that there
haven't been any Iran sponsored terror
attacks in this country that I'm aware
of in the last 25 years there of course
been many many many sponsored by Saudi
Arabians of the Gulf states the Sunni
Arab world so why should we see Iran as
our primary threat because Iran for many
decades has been the world's central
banker of international terrorism
funding sHIIP Sunni terrorist on an
equal-opportunity basis providing arms
to them as they do to Hamas and the Gaza
Strip so it's their support for
terrorism generally that that should
concern is not necessarily specific
attacks in the United States but I mean
wouldn't I mean in order to you know
commit American troops and the billions
it takes to prosecute any kind of
conflict wouldn't you want to go after
the people who are attacking us here for
yeah well nobody's talking about
committing massive amounts of troops
what we have to worry about I think most
importantly is the threat of North
Korea's nuclear weapons program which is
more advanced than Iran's but it all
ties together in the Middle East you may
have seen reports recently of a UN
inspectors study of North Korea selling
chemical weapons precursor chemicals and
equipment to manufacture chemical
weapons to Syria likely financed by Iran
so there's a palpable threat of weapons
of mass destruction something President
Trump
acted against earlier in his term that
the North Koreans have brought into the
Middle East with Iran's participate I
believe that they're all bad places
though in 2015 you wrote a piece for The
New York Times saying we ought to bomb
Iran in order to stop their weapons
that's not quite what I said that's what
the New York Times headlines right well
I read it anyway I mean that as you know
that they write the headlines in the
op-ed writer right but I don't think
that's the only time you call for
conflict armed conflict with the run but
if we had done that then what do you
think we'd be now well I think Israel
could have done it 15 years before and
we'd be in a much better place as Israel
itself and the United States are in a
better place today for Israel having
bombed Saddam Hussein's nuclear reactor
in 1981 and for Israel having bombed the
reactor that North Korea was building in
Syria in September of 2007 so you've
you've called for regime change in Iraq
Libya Iran and Syria in the first two
countries we've had regime change and
obviously it's been ice a disaster I
think now no I don't agree with that and
let me let me I don't think it's been a
disaster no because to argue that you
have to argue let's just take a rock to
begin with you have to argue that
everything that followed from the fall
of Saddam Hussein followed inevitably
solely and unalterably from the decision
to overthrown and that's simply no I
would never argue that I'm merely
arguing the map you have to sir since
you well you just said that Iran is the
single greatest threat to us into that
region I think you'll concede that
Saddam was the greatest counterbalance
to Iran and they were
empowered by his by his fall so I think
it's fair to say if you think a Rana is
the real threat that way you know he's
kind of hard to defend that decision
right no because I think your analysis
is simple-minded frankly okay the
Iranian threat which stems from the
Revolution of 1979 was under way quite
apart from what Saddam Hussein was doing
the Iranians have been trying to get
nuclear weapons for 25 you don't think
the Saddam Hussein's made a run stronger
I think it made the the fall of Saddam
no did not make Iran stronger what made
Iran stronger ultimately was the
withdrawal of American forces in 2011 so
if you I mean I I'm not seeing it the
only person who thinks that you're the
only person I've met who thinks that
what would you say if you could sum up
the one lesson from what has happened in
Iraq what would it be well I think the
overthrow of Saddam Hussein that
military action was a resounding success
I think the mistakes that were made
subsequently setting up the Coalition
Provisional Authority and others that
followed from it are lessons about what
to do after a regime is overthrown but
I'd also point out because of President
Bush's surge policy when his
administration ended stability had
returned to Iraq it was not a place
you'd go for vacation right but he
turned it over to Barack Obama and it
fell apart subsequently and the point I
think you need to understand yeah is
that life is complicated in the Middle
East and when you say well the overthrow
of Saddam Hussein was a mistake is
simplest I would argue that I'm the one
who understands how complicated is but
just my view it's it's your long
experience in foreign policy no better
record than yours I would say but thank
you ambassador Curtis you're oh man that
ending that ending John Paul's like yeah
it's your long experience in foreign
policy huh Tucker and Tucker's like oh
my records better than yours [ __ ] okay
so first of all oh you [ __ ] are
gonna make me defend Tucker Carlson ah
oh it hurts it pains me to do this but I
have to do it because he's right and
John Bolton is wrong so let's break this
down
he says Iran is the number one state
sponsor of terrorism there's no other
way to describe that but preposterous ly
wrong and target Karlsson accurately
points out when named the Shia suicide
bombers against us Nieman named the Shia
terrorists who've attacked here and then
he rightly points out again that it's
really the Salafi militants who are the
problem it's really the ultra right-wing
Sunni militants who are an issue and
Bolton just kind of [ __ ] swipes that
to the side and acts like that's not
true that that's clearly the case I mean
what what is it 15 of the 19 hijackers
on 9/11 or 16 of the 19 hijackers are
from Saudi Arabia they are the ones
spreading radical fundamentalist
ideology
salafism Wahhabism all around the world
by exporting their extreme
interpretation of Islam and building
mosques all over the place and then they
have the nerve to try to argue that the
problem is Iran and the problem are the
Shias who are the counter balance to
fundamentalist Sunni supremacy so it's
just come on man it's just so
disingenuous and such [ __ ] and then
he talks about how well the you know big
problem is their nuclear development
well then I guess you'd better think
Obama for that now shouldn't you now
I've been super critical of Obama that's
clear everybody knows that but at the
same time there are some things he
deserves credit for the Iran deal was
one of those things it's a deal that
says hey we're gonna have the IAEA the
International Atomic Energy Agency
regulate and check Iran's nuclear
program all the time and make sure they
only enrich for power for their power
grid and for research purposes and then
in return all you have to do is give
Iran back their own money so it does
prevent Iran from getting a nuclear
weapon there's no doubt about it but
we've repeatedly violated the nuclear
deal now and John Bohlen wants to
totally get out of the nuclear deal and
they're probably about to do that by the
way that's all the reports that in May
Trump's can apply to the nuclear deal
which makes it way more likely they will
get a nuclear weapon so if you're
concerned about Iran nuclear development
then you should get your ass out of the
White House and you should get Donald
Trump's ass out of the White House you
should have somebody in there who
believes in preserving the
nuclear deal cuz that guarantees they
don't create a nuclear weapon when you
blow up the diplomacy
that'll make it so they do get a weapon
and then he goes on a [ __ ] [ __ ]
totally made-up argument of oh we have
evidence of North Korea selling weapons
to Syria and then Syria might sell it to
Iran just like you know Colin Powell and
you he was one of the the key people who
pushed for the argument that Saddam was
connected to Osama bin Laden and Saddam
had weapons of mass destruction he
always argued out now hey we got new
regime chance because Saddam oh my god
Saddam and the weapons in Saddam and
9/11 and Saddam and al-qaeda we got to
do we got to look at all the evidence oh
my god yellowcake we have yellowcake oh
my god look Colin Powell oh my god there
he is at the UN holding up a vial he's
holding a vial we have to take him
seriously okay sorry we gotta act so
this guy who has zero credibility about
anything is now the one who's stepping
forward and going well you know North
Korea's selling weapons to Syria totally
made-up and then by the way even if that
were a for a second that's true are they
doing that because they're about to
launch a preemptive strike against
Oklahoma no so then what the [ __ ] are
you why are you like we got act we got
to act and make no mistake about it john
bolton wants to be more involved in
syria john bolton wants to be more
involved in iraq john bolton wants to
start new wars with north korea and iran
so he's never met a war he didn't like
and as he's accusing tucker carlson of
having a simple-minded explanation he's
there's never been somebody with a
simpler mind than john bolton because it
doesn't matter what the problem is in
question the answer is more US military
he's gonna accuse anybody of being
simple-minded are you kidding me your
answer is always the same and this is
why i say neal conservatism and american
exceptionalism manifests as a
fundamentalist religion because
neoconservatism and american
exceptionalism it really is imperialism
and american supremacy so he thinks
we're better than everybody we should be
the only superpower in the world we
should control everything that's
happening around the war
and we're right and good by definition
so only when you have that kind of
warped mind set that fundamentalist
mindset can you rationalize and justify
as he's doing in offensive invasion
against the country that didn't attack
us they killed minimum two hundred
thousand civilians and by the way we
tortured on top of it and we're still
there today so the this guy is as
Extreme as it gets he's the worst of the
neo cons I was joking about it the other
day on Twitter I said John Bolton makes
George W Bush look like Noam Chomsky and
so then Tucker Carlson rightly points
out Iraq and Lybia regime change was
terrible there and Bolton disagrees I
know it's a we now there's now literally
slave markets in Libya slavery has
returned to Libya now I'm no fan of
Gadhafi and I'm sure everybody listening
here is not a fan of Gadhafi but you
know what else I'm not a fan of slave
markets and perhaps if we just mind get
our own [ __ ] business and didn't get
involved in Libya it be a more stable
country today and you wouldn't have Isis
proliferation in Libya as you do right
now and you wouldn't have [ __ ] slave
markets as you do right now and oh yeah
on top of that again we're talking about
an offensive bombing of a country that
didn't attack us which is a violation of
international law
so we violated international law in the
process and we [ __ ] up the country
even further than it was [ __ ] up in
the first place but no Libya invasions
good the Iraq invasion is good forget
the minimum 200,000 dead civilians you
know it's it's it's better now because
it's better than Saddam's gone and then
this is how you know John Bolton just
his view of the world is just factually
wrong is that when Tucker Carlson points
out hey man you're so against Iran why
were you in favor of the Iraq war then
because if you're so against Iran you
can't be in favor of the Iraq war
because Saddam was the counterbalance to
Iran in the region so when you toppled
Saddam and then by the way after Saddam
what happened Saddam was a Sunni leader
they put a Shia leader in place the u.s.
did so you're so against Iran and you
know you're so scared of Shia dominance
of the region then why did you topple
the Sunni counterbalance in the region
and put a Shia government in place that
which then in turn aligned
with Iran and he's like now that no that
didn't happen and tell Carlson's like
you know the [ __ ] you're talking about
you know it's [ __ ] you're talking about
that's not you don't know what the [ __ ]
you're talking about and then he argues
one other problem is that we pulled out
in the first place we're still in Iraq
today okay so we took a little [ __ ]
few months break when we temporarily
drew down that we went back in there
again I told you his answer is always
the same more war more US militarism
more occupation and so in other words
his answer is [ __ ] everything up and
then stay there forever
really john bolton and then what about
the fact that our [ __ ] infrastructure
gets a great a d+ how we gonna pay for
that huh how we gonna pay for that how
we gonna pay for the fact that half a
workers in america make $30,000 a year
or less and we've had middle-class wages
stagnating since the 1980s but you want
to take our hard-earned tax dollars you
want to take money of regular people and
then ship it to be as overseas so we can
[ __ ] dominate and control the world
when nobody asks for that nobody in
Kentucky's like wow you know I really
think the next movie that we should make
is we should invade Somalia and set up a
[ __ ] military base there and
micromanage their lives so listen we're
in trouble
we're in trouble because john bolton is
uh he's as bad as it gets
he's as right-wing as it gets he's as
ultra hawkish as it gets and even a guy
like tucker carlson who's very
right-wing on issues of foreign policy
he's more of a paleo conservative than a
neoconservative he's a throwback to the
days when you know people on the right
said i don't actually believe in small
government in the sense that i don't I
don't even want to have a big military
like I want to have a smaller government
in that sense too so Tucker Carlson's
right on this and john bolton is dead
wrong and he's so extreme that even
other neo-cons and I know Tucker
Carlson's on a neocon so I'm not
referring to him but even other neo-cons
look at john bolton like damn son he's a
little out there because he does wanna
bomb iran he wants to bomb North Korea
he's never met a war he
like and now he has the ear of the empty
minded easily persuadable idiot
president watch out
hello everybody I wanted to talk about
freewill versus determinism today so of
course the idea of freewill is that
basically you're the author of your own
destiny and you can choose how to act in
this world and the idea of determinism
is that you're really not in control as
much as your mind makes you think you
are we have a very very rigid
deterministic world in that between
genetics and the physical laws of nature
and your personal experiences in your
own environment and how nurture and your
culture has shaped you effectively it's
almost like an equation and you put all
of that information into a big machine
and then out the other end comes the
very next action you will take and that
idea is it's for everything in your life
so if you choose right now to I don't
know get up and go run a few laps around
a track or something you're not really
choosing to do that it's that the
physical the physical condition of you
know your surrounding environment and
your own genetics and your own life
experiences has made it so that you're
basically captive to the nature of
reality and you're just following the
path that was laid out for you already
that's probably a shitty way of
explaining it but that's as good a job
as I could do now we're gonna look at
Sam Harris argue in favor of determinism
ISM he he basically believes that free
will is an illusion or a myth we're
gonna give you Daniel Dennett's position
Daniel Dennett is another one of he's
considered one of the new atheist one of
the Four Horsemen of new atheism but he
has a position on freewill that's uh III
think he
describe it as like a middle ground it's
called compatibilism it tries to marry
together some of the ideas of
determinism with the idea of free will
and then also we're gonna look at Noam
Chomsky who seems to although he hedges
on in many ways he seems to hold on to
the idea that free will is true so we're
gonna have somebody represent the
deterministic position
somebody represent kind of the middle
ground which is compatible list and then
Noam Chomsky represent you know one
flavor or another of free will now
what's interesting about this debate to
me is that and I've discussed as few
other times on my show going back years
ago but I was always under the
impression that determinism was actually
kind of a religious notion because how
many times have you heard in your life
the idea of like oh was God's plan like
yeah God has a plan and issue X happened
as a result of God's plan and therefore
you know don't worry cuz you're really
not in the driver's seat God's in the
driver's seat he's the author of
everything and he already designed it
and laid out a path for you and freewill
is not real in that conception of the
world if the idea is that God is the
author of everything and designed the
universe and has a plan well then you're
just kind of like a passenger seat in
the car ride and God is in the driver's
seat so I always thought determinism was
kind of like a religious notion and in
my mind I thought well freewill is
clearly the idea of you know you are
responsible for your own actions and you
have the freedom to make decisions in
your life and I always thought that that
was viewed as the more hardcore
scientific perspective now what's
interesting is that I wasn't totally
right in that impression it's it's much
more complicated than that in fact there
are plenty of people
who have a naturalistic and you know
humanist version of the world many
people who are scientific minded who
believe determinism is true and Sam
Harris is a good example that but
there's many others it's not just him
it's there are many people who are
adherence to the scientific method who
think determinism is correct and it's
also the case that there plenty of
religious people who think freewill is
true they think that God has given you
free will and then you have to pick how
you will act in this world and if you
choose to act morally than in the
afterlife you get rewarded with that and
you end up going to heaven as opposed to
hell that's the you know a religious
conception of free will but anyway me
talking about all this is my long-winded
way of explaining how it was more
complicated than my impression
originally where you know basically
basically my idea was well obviously if
your determinist you're kind of like a
religious a crazy person not crazy
person that's too strong but you're
religious and that you think God has a
plan so you're just in the passenger
seat and everybody who is rational
believes in free will it turns out it's
much more complicated than that and it's
actually a mix there are plenty people
who are and aren't religious who believe
in free will and plenty of people who
are and aren't religious who believe in
determinism so okay having said that
let's jump in we're gonna start with the
determinist position this is Sam Harris
I'll probably pause as we go along here
and weigh in with my thoughts but I want
suggest either the problem of freewill
is actually deeper than that it's deeper
than the problem of cause and effect by
the way I put it on 1.5 speed so my bed
if you're not used to that I used to
hate the speed up thing but now I love
it I you just have to kind of get used
to listening that quickly but once you
do get used to it now I can't imagine
myself going back and listening to stuff
on regular speed but this is 1.5 speed
so if it's annoying you you could just
slow it down on your own end here that
we we have the problem is we had a
subjective experience of freewill but it
can't be mapped onto physical reality
you know I'm about to argue that free
will doesn't even correspond to any
subjective fact
if you pick a let me just say we're off
the bat I don't agree with that at all
yeah of course the subjective experience
that everybody has is that they have
free will and listen don't take my word
for it think about in your own mind how
you feel how do you how do you feel on a
day to day basis do you feel like you
are making decisions and you're you know
a free agent if you will and you are
deciding what happens I certainly feel
that way now he's gonna go on and and
qualify that statement by saying you
know you just have to look a little
deeper under the surface and then you
see where I'm coming from but just at
face value I don't agree with that at
all I think the opposite is true
everybody kind of has that feeling that
they you know subjectively that they
have free will let's continue into your
experience closely you can notices if
you pay attention you can see that you
know more decide the next thing you
think then the next thing I say thoughts
simply appear in consciousness I don't
look like my words hey what are you
gonna think next what am I gonna say
next I guess uh Denise are talking about
the pleasures of snowshoeing you know
where did that come from from what from
your point you came out of nowhere
they put the same thing with happening
in the privacy of your own mind we've
all made it an effort to be here and to
stay this extra hour here presumably to
hear what I have to say about free will
but there's also a beliefs in your head
and it's just same things haven't you
noticed and many of these things have
nothing to do with what I'm talking
about struggling to follow my train of
thought but there's competition you
suddenly start thinking things like I
should probably stop drinking diet soda
the thoughts just emerge in
consciousness we are not authoring that
would require that we think of them
before we think them if you can't
control your next thought and you don't
know what it's gonna be until it arises
where is your freedom of will now at
this moment many of you were thinking
what the hell is you talking about here
here's one talking about you didn't pick
that thought either well come back to
this one okay let me just say so what's
interesting about the argument he's
making here is I think it's a
distinction without a difference from a
lot of people who believe in free will
because that would still be defined as
you so in other words you have thoughts
popping up in your mind and he's saying
well where are they coming from
like that's not you like you're you
think you get to make the final decision
on the thoughts that pop up in your mind
but you don't know where the thoughts
come up that pop up in your mind they
just show up so what's weird about that
is I actually think that this might be a
little too strong with statement but I
think that's cut almost unscientific
because it's coming from your
subconscious mind or unconscious mind so
like yes thoughts are popping up in
consciousness but that's your
consciousness that thoughts are popping
up in so I think that this it's almost
like just a semantics issue at the end
of it because somebody can totally grant
him this point he's making and still
believe in free will because they just
say okay I am defining that as you so in
other words he's arguing you're not the
thinker of thoughts the thoughts pop up
in your mind and you don't know where
they come from and then the counterpoint
I'm making to that is well no that's
still you it's still your mind where
those thoughts are popping up so it's
like it just strikes me as he's making a
distinction without a difference and
somebody who believes in free will can
concede his point here but anyway let's
continue of course in a sense we do
think our thoughts before we think them
release our brain does and much of this
thinking is is something we never hear
about
and we're conscious of only a tiny
fraction of the information that our
brains process in each moment we
continually notice changes in our
experience in thoughts and moods and
sensations and behavior but we are
utterly unaware of the neural
physiological events that produce the
changes we consider the sensation of
touching your finger to your nose
you feel free try this and the cons of
the contact here simultaneous people we
know at the level of the brain that it
can't be we know that that the input
reaches sent from the finger reaches
sensory cortex after the input from the
nose this is true no matter how short
your arms along your nose if you're of a
mind to experiment works when your toe
is also so the brains correct for this
timing discrepancy by clearly buffering
the inputs in memory and then delivering
the apparent simultaneity to
consciousness so your experience of the
present moment using in a very real
sense a memory of the present moment and
even the simplest conscious sensations
are built upon unconscious mechanism an
unconscious process in which we are
fundamentally unaware you know people to
say this unconscious machinery also
governs what we think can feel and do
intend as well it's not an unjust
perception and that is where notions of
free will and more responsibility begin
to get sweets many people now
demonstrate it in a lab that person's
choices behavioral choices and voluntary
choices can be detected some moments
sometimes seconds before they are
consciously aware of having made the
choice over the physiologist in Jamila
Bey
quite famously do this with EEG but this
basic paradigm is replicated with fMRI
and indirect recordings from the cortex
in certain tissues and each of these
experiments people give them a very
simple task to push a left button as
opposed to a right button or move their
left hand brush at the right hand and
they just have to watch a clock and
decide when they were first consciously
aware of committing to the left or the
right can you do this and several
experiments over the years have shown
that people can go back and forth as
much as they want to become consciously
aware of when they when they're
committed they make their choice and yet
the experimenter is by scanning the
brain for one modality or another know
some half a second a second depending on
what the decision is even several
seconds before they do what they're
gonna do so as a result of this work and
is it's actually scientifically
uncontroversial to say that some moments
before you are aware of what you are
going to do it was simple you make it a
simple voluntary action at a time at
which you appear to be subjectively free
to do whatever you want your brain has
already determined what
will do and then you can gradually aware
of this decision while while you still
think during the process of making it
now I'm able to say this this is very
difficult to reconcile with conventional
notion of free will because this tiny
discrepancy demonstrates that you an
epochal for someone to know what you
were going to do before you do and while
you still think you you're free to make
up your mind but the truth is I think
actually too much of the native his
research the truth is even if there were
no time like even if a conscious
intention we're truly simultaneous with
its neuro physiological underpinnings
that we still be no room for free will
because you still wouldn't know why it
is you do what you do and again this is
a fact you can notice about yourself
directly let's run a little experiment
think of a city anywhere in the world
choose any city one yeah of course I
could of prime deal I could have
artfully placed queues in my speech in
the last minute it would make you more
likely to think just real quick I want
to say about the point about the study
that shows they could predict the
decision you make before you make it I
think that's interesting research and he
Sam Harris seems to think that it
indicates that okay there's no such
thing as free will there is a rebuttal
to that I'm not gonna mention the
rebuttal at this moment but Noam Chomsky
actually addresses that directly in his
comments so I just wanted to throw that
out there real quick and he's gonna go
on now to talk about how again well he
says even if that wasn't the case you
still like even if that research didn't
exist he thinks it's still you still
can't say that you have free will
because again he kind of goes back to
his original point here which is you
don't really know where those thoughts
come from in your mind the thoughts just
kind of pop up in your own mind but then
again I argue that's more of a semantic
issue because it's still those thoughts
are still appearing in your mind so you
know you could say hey you got to having
those thoughts pop up in your mind
because of your DNA and your lived
experience and whatever just happened to
you at breakfast or whatever you
saw on a billboard or something but the
that thoughts are popping up in your
mind it is still your mind so the idea
of like not ascribing your your
ownership to those thoughts I just think
is a little I have a hard time grasping
that because again I think ultimately
his description strikes me not that he's
doing it on purpose by any stretch of
the imagination but it strikes me as a
little bit of a semantic game it's like
well that's not really you because those
thoughts are appearing it's like yeah
but they're appearing in your mind so
that is you almost by definition but
let's continue Las Vegas for instance so
Beyonce so I don't think biggest city
any city and it must be pay attention to
what this conscious process is like now
the first thing to notice about this is
it this is free decision as you are ever
gonna make in your life you have all the
cities in the world to choose from
now several cities are probably her to
you I just focus on one everybody no I'm
sorry to say that you all pick the wrong
City don't ask me how I know this but I
do so I just watch you do this again
just you can see what the process like
pick another city can't be the first and
notice what that experience is like okay
did you see any evidence for free will
now we better people to find it here I
think it's not here it's not anywhere so
let's look for it first let's set aside
all those cities whose names you don't
know and therefore cannot picked maybe
you couldn't pick one of those if your
life depended on there's no freedom in
that obviously okay and there are many
other cities whose names quite well
known to you which simply didn't occur
to you to pick the first instance Cairo
didn't occur to you absolutely no the
Cairo is a city but for whatever reason
your Cairo circuits were not engaged as
a matter of neurophysiology Cairo was
not in the cards so I want you think
about this were you free to choose that
which did not occur to you to choose now
based on this on a state of your brain a
few moments ago Cairo was not coming
where is the freedom in that okay I
don't this is another one of those
arguments I don't I don't really get
the point he's trying to make because
he's basically saying and and he
actually goes on to make the point like
okay look at it like a movie if we could
rewind time to when I asked you to come
up with a city like could you have
conceivably picked something else and
that's a weird way of putting it because
what he's asking is it's almost like a
tautology it's like things are how they
are by definition so can they be
different it's like well no if you ask
it like that of course things are what
they are
so no it couldn't be different if it if
you're just describing what is and
saying if we rewind it like it's a movie
and press play could it be different but
that doesn't strike me as anything other
than a tautology it doesn't mean that
conceivably or theoretically you know
you actually couldn't have given you
know slightly different circumstances
you couldn't have other you know parts
of your brain firing that give you a
different answer the question so I don't
really understand the point that he's
trying to make here it's but you see
this a lot where and I think Daniel
Dennett touches on this where people who
are hardcore determinists this is an
argument that they make where they say
okay look at the way things unfolded if
you could go back to you know five years
ago or ten years ago or whatever could
you conceivably have changed it and I
mean the very premise of the question
being that we're in a state of reality
right now where everything was a certain
way it's like well no because if you're
assuming that the state of reality is
the same as it is today but we rewind
time well then if we're still gonna end
up in this same place in time then no by
definition it couldn't have changed it's
a tautology to say that but that doesn't
strike me as a point it strikes me as
like an on point because again if you
use it the example like a movie
it's like saying okay if you press
rewind on an actual movie you know
whatever you pick the movie Mighty Ducks
or Tombstone like if we press rewind
would be the same thing well yeah by
definition will be the same thing
because it's the same movie but
that doesn't mean that it's not
conceivably or theoretically possible
that the outcome could change given
slight tweaks in one direction or
another whether it be tweaks in genetic
code or tweaks in you know the
environmental or a cultural experience
Donald Trump had a meeting with top
Saudi officials at the White House and
he put on an embarrassing and shameful
display by bragging about how great they
are for doing business with us
thank you very much everybody it's a
great honor to have the Crown Prince
with us Saudi Arabia's been a very great
friend and a big purchaser of equipment
and lots of other things and one of the
biggest investments in the United States
is there I guess it's your big
investment is buying stock in companies
and various other things in the United
States and creating jobs we've become
very good friends over a fairly short
period of time I was in Saudi Arabia in
May and we are bringing back hundreds of
billions of dollars into the United
States and we understand that and they
understand that some of the things that
have been approved and are currently
under construction and will be delivered
to Saudi Arabia very soon and that's for
their protection but if you look in
terms of dollars three billion dollars
five hundred and thirty three million
dollars five hundred and twenty five
million dollars that's peanuts for you
should have increased it eight hundred
and eighty million dollars six hundred
and forty five million dollars six
billion dollars that's four frigates 889
million 63 million and that's for
various artillery some of the things
that we're now working on next and that
have been ordered and will shortly be
started in construction and delivered
that system thirteen billion dollars the
c-130 helic airplanes the Hercules great
plane three point eight billion dollars
the Bradley vehicles
that's the tanks one point two billion
dollars and the p8 Poseidon's one point
four billion dollars
and what it does is it really means many
many jobs we're talking about over
40,000 jobs in the United States so
we'll make the best equipment in the
world there's nobody even close and
Saudi Arabia is buying a lot of this
equipment and a lot of people are at
work making the equipment not only for
us because we as you know we were
getting a seven hundred billion dollar
military proposal and that's even a lot
for you guys but we're getting a seven
hundred billion dollar military plan
this year in 716 will be next year 716
billion dollars so we're we really have
a great friendship a great relationship
I would really have to say the
relationship was to put it mildly very
very strained during the Obama
administration and the relationship now
is probably as good as it really ever
been what a kook I mean this is a guy
who said when he was running for
president before he ran for president
he accurately pointed out that what is
it 16 of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 came
from Saudi Arabia the ideology of these
extremists comes from Saudi Arabia I'm
talking of course about Wahhabism the
ultra-conservative far right
interpretation literalist interpretation
of islam that al-qaeda believes in Isis
believes in so you have a group of utter
extremists and Donald Trump goes from
calling that out before he was president
when he was running for president to
becoming the number one cook because
business overrides any practical
concerns pragmatic concerns or massive
ideological differences or even
terrorism so business as usual the
status quo the establishment keeping
everything trucking along as always
that's something Trump used to criticize
and now he's the biggest cheerleader of
it and he's bragging about
how close he is with the Saudi crime
family
what a mega kook that's my new nickname
for Donald Trump mega kook that's what
you are buddy so holy [ __ ] that's so sad
now the most important point here is
those weapons are being used in a
genocide that's not an opinion that's
not conjecture that's not Kyle putting
some left-wing spin on it that's the
reality of the situation look at what's
going on in Yemen right now
Saudi Arabia is blockading the country
not allowing in medicine so there's a
cholera epidemic over there not allowing
in food so there are people millions of
people who are starving to death Saudi
Arabia has targeted mosques and open-air
markets and hospitals and schools
they've even bombed schools for the
blind they're using cluster bombs that
the US has given them that are illegal
under international law so there are so
many violations of international law and
it's a humanitarian crisis and it's on
purpose it's a choice and the US has
been helping them by the way not just
arming them and giving the money and
propping them up but also helping them
in terms of pointing out the places on
the map where they need to be bombing so
this is we're carrying out a genocide
and you have this shows you how
disconnected we are from the
consequences of our actions because when
you're the world's sole superpower
doesn't Matt you don't who's gonna hold
you [ __ ] a complan was gonna hold you
accountable so you don't need to give a
[ __ ] about the consequences of your
actions but how pathetic is it that
they're bragging about these weapons we
know they're gonna be used for a
genocide and the media I haven't heard a
single [ __ ] thing from the media
connecting the dots going wow we're
arming people who are committing a
genocide right now that's wild maybe we
shouldn't be doing that nobody in the
media is saying this nobody in the media
is talking about this how pathetic is
mainstream media in the United States of
America I mean and then it's amazing
because the other day Donald Trump
called to congratulate Putin on his
re-election everybody melted down on TV
and in corporate media now Obama also
did that in 2012 and Obama did that soon
after a Vladimir Putin invaded Georgia
not the US Georgia the Georgia over
there but those you don't know so now
that really made a big deal about that
actually that's not fair that the right
wing melted down when that happened so
but I said back then no I that's what
you do when you're a world leader I
don't really care about words you're
just playing the game to try to have
influence over that country in one way
or another if you say hey
congratulations on your win
sure he didn't actually win it but
you're just playing the game when you
say stuff like that I don't really care
about words you know what I do care
about material support so in other words
in the eyes of corporate media it's
outrageous and unacceptable when you
congratulate an authoritarian leader who
won a election but it's not outrageous
when we arm and prop up an authoritarian
country carrying out a genocide I don't
care about the congratulations are you
kidding me I'd much rather have the us
congratulate Saudi Arabia over anything
then [ __ ] arm them and prop them up
as they carry out a genocide and we know
they're carrying out a genocide so I
care about the material support pisses
me off
and the u.s. supports 73 percent of the
world's dictatorships so the fact that
they're melting down over a phone call
to an authoritarian leader who we don't
support materially while they ignore the
73% of the world citator ships that we
do support militarily just shows you how
skewed the perception is that's all it
is is you're serving you know
militaristic ends and the
military-industrial complex when you tow
their line like that and again I just
can't get over the fact that these
weapons are gonna be used in a genocide
and nobody in the media is going holy
[ __ ] he's bragging about giving weapons
to somebody carrying out a genocide
could you imagine instead of us fighting
the Nazis if at the time we ended up
militarily supporting the Nazis
could you imagine if we're like oh here
take we're gonna sell you a bunch of
different war planes and we're gonna
sell you tanks and good luck and then
you show [ __ ] charts with how much
money or are you kidding me
but there's a genocide going on in Yemen
right now primarily being carried out by
Saudi Arabia with our assistance and
nobody bats an eyelash okay that's what
we're doing cuz jobs something jobs Oh
God
there are other ways to create jobs like
a new New Deal you could build a
high-speed rail you could build a
renewable energy economy there's a
million you rebuild our entire
infrastructure instead you're bragging
about jobs that will be used for
massacres of women and children and
civilians so this is a giant scandal
it's not being treated that way by any
stretch of the imagination and so this
is Trump being cooked by the Saudis but
guess what it's not just Donald Trump
the Senate also bowed down to Saudi
Arabia so it was Bernie Sanders and Mike
Lee were just a few of a number of
co-sponsors on a bill that stopped the
US support of Saudi Arabia in the
massacre in Yemen so they proposed a
bill to stop the siege of Yemen and 55
senators voted against ending it
why on earth why on earth would the
Senate be in favor of continuing the
massacre and destruction of Yemen well
we know the answer the answer is because
they have many jobs in their district
tied to the military-industrial complex
you know they're very clever with how
they go about this did you know that
there are there's military goods that
are produced in every state in the
United States so when that's the case
you get Democrats and Republicans
generally being okay with making these
weapons and selling these weapons around
the world because they have a number of
jobs in their district that are tied to
that but
more importantly many of these people
get money in campaign contributions when
they run for office from those so-called
defense contractors they're really
offense contractors at this point so you
have senators cooked by the
military-industrial complex in the Saudi
crime family now again this is one of
those issues where people are saying
yeah but hey it got more votes in favor
of ending the siege of Yemen than people
thought so yeh how's that gonna look in
the history books man like hey we almost
stopped the genocide that we were
partaking in almost doesn't count for
the countless dead bodies that are
laying on the ground that just got hit
with a missile from a plane almost
doesn't count so this it's just beyond
sad and the Senate and they always
routinely vote in favor of continuing to
arm Saudi Arabia is this what the
American people want take a poll ask the
American people how they feel about this
they're not going to agree with the
Senate and then the final point I'll
make here is there are now allegations
of the Saudis owning Jared Kushner the
Saudi prince was heard saying yeah Jared
Kirchner was in my pocket and they going
to intercept has a great piece where
they go into detail where they explain
how Jared Cushman was reading the
president's briefings like the most top
top top secret information I was getting
so he knew everything okay and one night
he decided oh I'm gonna fly to Saudi
Arabia for a meeting now
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson at the
time did not approve of it was not okay
with it but characters like I'm going to
Saudi Arabia so he went to Saudi Arabia
and they apparently him and the crown
prince stayed up until four o'clock in
the morning a few nights in a row
and guess what it was soon after Jared
Kushner left that the Saudi Crown Prince
went in
got all the people who were not okay
with his power grab and locked him up at
the hotel in Riyadh and tortured at
least one of them to death and force
them to sign over billions of dollars
worth of assets so the idea is Jared
Kushner was reading these briefings one
of the thing in things in these
briefings was the names of the people
who were against the Saudi Crown Prince
consolidating power his brazen power
grab so Jared Kushner went to Saudi
Arabia told the Crown Prince in exchange
for what
who knows told the crown prince hey here
your enemies and then the crown prince
said thank you I'll get you back soon
with whatever money investments and some
cushion or properties or whatever and
then the Saudi Crown Prince rounded up
all the people who were his enemies and
against his power grab and then locked
him away so this could be Jared Kushner
you want to talk about collusion you
want to talk about sharing classified
information and then Rex Tillerson there
was a there was a time when Rex
Tillerson heard about what Jericho was
doing behind his back and he's like who
the [ __ ] is Secretary of State here is
it me or is it him
so Kushner's doing some [ __ ]
there's no doubt about that and this is
the influence that Saudi Arabia has over
our government and this is the level of
corruption that we're dealing with the
Senate does their bidding even when
they're carrying out genocide Jared
Kushner likely told the crown prince
who's against him and then he locked him
up the crown prince locked him up and
now Donald Trump is just bragging about
the amount of weapons that were giving
them so they can continue to carry out
that genocide if you're not beyond
pissed off by this and outraged by this
you ain't paying attention
it Halla [ __ ] Dow what it do
I'm gonna apologize to everybody because
I'm eating an apple and I will I will
not stop eating this Apple I'll he's
gonna be you because of the noise the
mouth noise she was like it's so
disgusting when you eat in your podcast
I was like I'm hungry at that time so I
want to eat I mean I agree with her but
if I don't eat this Apple I'll be like
dead by the end of the podcast sometimes
I'd like a snack or something like that
just to like I mean even in school back
in the day I would need something but
like just keep my like keep me awake or
some [ __ ]
yeah my brain I sat down like 10 minutes
ago in this heat and like my brain
wasn't working I was like okay I have to
do something about this so I just um
when someone talks with their mouth full
like is that something you notice you
know I'm weird because if somebody is
like really aggressively chewing and you
hear the mouth noises that doesn't
bother me
mm-hmm what bothers me is actually the
opposite what bothers me is like when
they're chewing and it's not loud but
you still hear it mm-hmm you know I'm
saying it's almost there in between
hiding it and just saying [ __ ] it boss
the wall that's the [ __ ] that bothers me
and actually what bothers me more is
just not eating noises but just regular
mouth noises if somebody's sitting there
and they're like there's one of those
people where it gets quiet and you just
hear like some mouth noises like like
some [ __ ] like that
yeah or some weird swallowing noise a
nice to meet like that battle but yeah
I'm using it terrible to like be around
for an extended period of time because
I'm probably like a curmudgeon
[ __ ] after a while did I do
anything on a road trip that you notice
that like was like man I wish you could
say I don't know I know you didn't but
that's why we vibe I think you're pretty
good at you're pretty good at like
sensing it's in the pipe yeah sensing
the mood of other people mm-hmm
and like you're cognizant of that and so
you know how to like navigate that
whereas some people they don't but it's
almost like they don't feed off of your
vibe that much and so they're just like
going their own [ __ ] 100 miles an hour
and that problem I'm probably hard to
beat those people it's hard for them to
be around me mmm because I might you
know after a while I might just lose it
F after a while on some stupid [ __ ] but
that's my fault you know I'm just a
weird kind of dude in that respect yeah
I used to remember the like I have
memories of like like being in school
and you try to eat chips or something
like that and you try and be like so
subtle about it and you because when you
eat a chip you hear it like in your
brain a lot more than what other people
do that's a great point so it's a point
you do hear a lot you remember that and
then that much yeah you'll be like like
and you hear that [ __ ] od in your head
and then the rest of the class you're
looking around like certain ones are
even louder I think like Frito Lays are
super loud corn chips mm-hmm they're
really loud I think they're them one of
the louder ones yeah I feel like Cheetos
like the puffy ones aren't that bad cuz
it's like just a lot of fluff no I
thought yeah Molly would always be like
don't eat on air cuz it's mad disgusting
and like it just sounds wrong and I'm
like it never bothered me that bad no I
never bothered me one thing I do notice
that bothers me though is if people are
doing podcasts on they smoke weed and
then they get the mean cottonmouth I'd
rather hear somebody chewing than hear
the cottonmouth
and I'm like clearing their throat or
something like yeah like the cottonmouth
and the clear in their throat because
like this I'm about cottonmouth where
you could hear that flyness
I put myself in their shoes and I'm just
like yo you need a drink right now like
you did chug the whole thing a Poland
Spring heart and even now you're just
putting a dent into your cottonmouth you
know what I mean mm-hmm but I don't mind
the eating as much as I mind that but
there are yes a listen to right now like
[ __ ] you you're eating right now and
talking now that [ __ ] doesn't buy and if
you do do it like you said like some
confidently [ __ ] and not on some like
trying to hide it yeah
like my most like iconic memories are
just like like videos or like I would be
at barbecues with just like a lot of
black people and they would be eaten and
they're just like over obnoxious
something like damn he looks like he's
really enjoying that [ __ ] eating some
ribs and it's just like this is
delicious and they're talking like
telling you a story about some [ __ ] like
back when I we were playing ball and uh
yeah I wanna be eaten on that type of
level one day not give a [ __ ] be telling
some story and someone just not even
like correcting me on my [ __ ] and I'm
just like really enjoying that [ __ ]
so I strive to get to that level by the
way this Apple has probably been in my
fridge for like over a week bad
Granny Smith it's what it's whatever the
green [ __ ] is yeah I don't know if Green
is Granny Smith and then the red ones
are like mama green dude to death you
don't like the red right or okay but I
like green a lot more do you ever get
funky with it and like cut it up and try
and put like peanut butter on it and
like really get weird with it when I was
younger I would do that I like apples
and peanut butter that's a good mix hell
yeah it's such a good combo like just
like the sweetness and then like the
peanut buttery sourness aren't there
yellow there's yellow are there yellow
apples too um I feel like there are okay
here my dog yeah that's alright no
worries
that [ __ ] barks all the time
when I come home and you would think
after like the tenth year that he's been
here he would realize that like it's
just gonna be me coming in with my book
bag and it's not some [ __ ] stranger
ass [ __ ] dogs are so dumb like dude
we've done this every day for the last
two years we've lived here we've
actually chill we actually touched on
two things I wanted to do polls about
the first one I was gonna do say red
versus green apple but that's why I
asked if there's yellow cuz we could
throw yellow in there there is a yellow
Apple I think those are pears right
while pairs exist but I think there's a
there's a yellow Apple to I'm gonna look
it up right now yellow Apple yeah I
think so
yellow and when I typed in AP apples was
the first thing that popped up a yellow
Apple yeah 25 different kinds of apples
damn that many yeah there's a bunch of
them you ever go apple picking yeah a
few times when I was younger I don't
really get the whole fun of it I don't
like strawberry picking because I don't
really like strawberries apple picking
was all right when you're a kid that's
some fun [ __ ] but as you get older it's
like whatever yeah and then you realize
the people that work there when you're
older just like some creepy Long Island
people who want to like steal your money
but when you're younger you're like so
what is the Apple place yeah like you
just realize that people who run these
businesses are just grimy creepy [ __ ]
people when you go there later in life
on like a date or something like that
like you want some apple potty but go
with that buddy and you're just like
yeah I just wanted to come here apple
picking cuz it was a date or something
have you ever had a pillared apple cider
donuts I think I have but I don't know
if I like them it's like when I had some
times it's too much like the they do too
much wood [ __ ] like there's too much
pumpkin [ __ ] there's too much apple [ __ ]
like keep it simple like there should be
some pumpkin pie that's banging and then
like you don't you'll need like pumpkin
syrup and pumpkin like dog food and like
I was never I was never a big fan of
pumpkin anything other than it was that
oh yeah okay so the first pole best
apple red green yellow I'm not gonna
micromanage it like McIntosh you know
what I mean granny yeah I think where
that is actually McIntosh now that
there's a few red but there's a bunch of
different red ones okay yeah like
there's a yeah when you go to the store
it's like there's a bunch of different
red ones um which can go with that best
apple red green yellow did you rinse the
Apple before yeah I did Israel
rush this [ __ ] I think so you think rads
gonna crush hey that's just the most I
think everybody's grown up with like red
apple is your friend that you grew up
with and like yeah but people some
people rebels like me and they're like
you'll [ __ ] your red apple where's my
green at I feel like it's like like
60/40 type [ __ ] yeah I think Reds gonna
win pretty handily
I think yellow is gonna get [ __ ] on it's
gonna be oh yeah yeah I don't even know
yellow like yeah we both know err we
didn't know was it existed like if I saw
a yellow Apple in the supermarket I
would be like something's wrong with
that [ __ ] like why'd you guys put that
out there what was the other one
you said dawg
you said you mentioned dog and I was
gonna do we were gonna do straight up
dog verse cat by the way I guess people
crush I asked people before the podcast
I was like give me Paul stuff anybody
hit you would [ __ ]
yeah the the dog verse cat one somebody
gave me and then there's a few more that
we're gonna do that the day gate that
some people gave me we had something
last week we were gonna do yeah I got
them right here okay Street Fighter
Mortal Kombat Tekken you're an Xbox
verse playstation do you play that
fortnight or asked you have you heard of
it
that video game no what is it
first-person shooter it's something like
that like a Henry was explaining that
[ __ ] to me well about how it makes it
different from any other shooting game
and I guess like the viewpoints are
different or something like that and I
was like sounds like every other game
why is it you know like everybody and
their mother plays that [ __ ] I can't
I've lost interest in games that I don't
that are not intuitive upfront like if I
have to [ __ ] force myself to learn
some [ __ ] and [ __ ] you like get make it
at least like I understand having to
learn to an extent because you it's a
game you have to learn how to play but
if it's difficult controls that even
after you learn it you don't get it then
that's not that's such a time investment
you know what I mean yeah yeah like you
got to make it so that it's somewhat
intuitive so yeah sitting there feeling
like a [ __ ] idiot on my twelfth time
trying to get that shot basis [ __ ] down
exactly like don't don't make it so hard
that I we can't do basic [ __ ] and I'm
gonna have to sit there and [ __ ] look
it up yeah I remember when I first the
only I I think I've said this before the
only game I used to play really on xbox
that was like a shooter was Tom Clancy's
like Splinter Cell mm-hmm and the game
was super hot up until this one point
where you had to like pick a lock and it
was like it was pretty far in the game
but like that made you lose interest
yeah it was impossible to pick the lock
and I remember like it was like when I
could go on the internet and look stuff
up and I don't really want to but then I
was like so into the game that I googled
like why is like how do you pick this
lock and there was like forums on it
like it's mad hard oh I can't do that
you got to do this that and the other
and I was like [ __ ] this game like yeah
I was really enjoying it up until this
point and I put a lot of work into look
like pick the lock but there should have
been a point where it was like all right
you could pick the [ __ ] even though you
don't really get it like you're trying
hard enough
okay that's exactly my point that's
exactly my point like you just lost
interest because it's like you made this
task too hard like the payoff if I get
through the [ __ ] is not even worth the
fact but you frustrated me so much in
the process to get through this lock
that even when I get through it it's not
gonna be like yes I'm through it it's
gonna be like [ __ ] you for making me
work that [ __ ] hard mm-hmm yeah it
wasn't it wasn't gonna be some sense of
like oh thank god oh thank god I beat
this level it was gonna go you [ __ ] this
game I never want to turn it on again
and like you make you want to break the
[ __ ] game I know that feeling man I
know that feeling
so for cats cat we're gonna do cats
verse dog straight up what are your
thoughts on that you're dog person right
yeah I've hate cats I think cats should
be thrown off of this planet that's
[ __ ] up dude
I was actually kind of torn I mean look
ultimately see here's the thing I like
dogs better cuz their demeanor is better
and [ __ ] and they are really loving and
they're more of a human being they know
like what's going on they're adorable
they're cute like yes so dogs win hands
down in that way but on the flip side
if the question is to own then I'm not
I'm not so sure I'm a dog person because
I was even looking into maybe getting a
kit in a while ago yeah I remember you
told me yeah it's a specific kind of
kitten it was like a British Shorthair
and there's another kitten called a
ragdoll kitten we're like they're they
want to like kind of cuddle with you and
[ __ ] they have like a very dog ish
demeanor for a cat but like the thing
about them that makes the cat's better
in my opinion to own is that it's so
much less work because cats are so much
more independent
yeah the nighttime maintenance you have
to do almost nothing almost nothing
mm-hmm so that's like versus a dog is
like you really have to give the dog a
lot of love and attention and you got to
walk the dog and they bark like a
[ __ ] every single bit yeah yeah
so to own I'm a cat person
I'm debt I would definitely be a cat
person but in terms of going over
somebody else's house Oh dog hands-down
if I'm going to somebody's house I don't
have to be around it for like three or
four hours yeah and then it's no
question a dog because you're gonna get
nothing but upside you're gonna get
nothing but you know the love and
attention and they'll play with you and
it's just like it you can't beat that
it's that they're the ideal pet yeah yes
so I just yeah I think if the question
was which would you rather be a dog or a
cat I'd absolutely want to be a cat I
think I relate more to look at Oh cuz
they're more independent and dogs or
more no because cats are just like I'm
just gonna chill right here for as long
as I want and then oh I'm gonna randomly
get up right now and just walk to
another spot and chill there it's good
that's like how I lived my life yeah I
saw this funny thing when I was when I
was younger I think my cousin sent it to
me like what's going on in the mind of a
cat versus a dog and the dog it's like I
woke up this morning my favorite thing I
breakfast my favorite thing I ran around
outside my favorite thing my owner pet
me my favorite thing and then for the
cat it was like some sinister [ __ ] like
looking at the owner like if I can find
a way to jump on the kitchen table and
take my claws and stab him in the neck I
think I could kill him and take control
of this whole domicile
and that's true it's like you see a cat
it looks really like independent and
like [ __ ] you I don't need you looking
at you like some big that's a master
plan in their head like I'm gonna one
day own this house yeah like if I was
bigger I can [ __ ] you up that's what a
catch thinking that's what like okay if
you think about it like they're
domesticated sure but if the cat was
bigger I mean how much bigger you have
to get and then all of a sudden it's a
[ __ ] Bobcat and then all of a sudden
it's a mountain lion and they all sudden
it's a [ __ ] Panther and then it's a
leopard and then it's a Jaguar and
there's a lion that's gonna rip your
[ __ ] neck so here the big would [ __ ]
you up what does a dog like evolution
[ __ ] would it like evolve all like a
horse oh [ __ ]
wolf dogs in fact dogs are domesticated
wolves that the dogs evolve to when
there were wolves that left the pack
because they would they would be around
the people and the people would feed
them scraps so like normal wolves would
[ __ ] a human up and just eat a human but
there are some like wolves that aren't
as fierce and don't have that mentality
to like be that killer instinct so the
last wolf in the pack yeah exactly so
that they would be the ones who kind of
hang out around the people they'd like
feed them their scraps and then though
the wolf and the people became friends
and then over time those kinds of wolves
when they would you know breed the next
generation would have those same kind of
characteristics those same traits and
then the further along you go the more
docile they become in the less fierce
they become and the more friendly they
become and then eventually dogs came out
of that hmm isn't that crazy that's
crazy
remember that from Neil deGrasse Tyson
this thing cosmos or whatever the [ __ ]
it was yeah yeah he was they were
explaining how dogs came about I was
like oh [ __ ] that's crazy that is nuts
I wonder if that'll happen with I mean
it's probably too small of a sample but
like those people that have like tame
lines and [ __ ] as pets
there's like only three of those people
out there but like eventually it takes
so much time like yeah yeah you're right
but like it takes so long for something
to evolve and like change characteristic
you know what I mean because yeah when I
say change I mean
[ __ ] change like their bodies got
smaller their ears took a different
shape their eyes took a different shape
their [ __ ] forgot a lot less hard it
got like softer so you know it's weird
you see this with pigs in a shorter time
frame if you take a domesticated pig you
know what a domesticated pig looks like
it's got like a pinkish kind of body
like a peachy pink --is-- kind of body
you release that pig in the wild it'll
grow thick hair and it'll grow [ __ ]
like [ __ ] what's the word toss fangs
not fangs like horn shits tusks or what
I think they're called tusks okay but
like they become a wild pig like a wild
pig is [ __ ] creepy looking
yeah that sounds creepy looking yeah
things are already [ __ ] creepy
looking as [ __ ] those things are nothing
to [ __ ] with wild pigs are nothing to
[ __ ] with thank you I wouldn't want to
[ __ ] with a wild pig yeah
okay so we got to do cat verse dog I
think dog is gonna crush in this pole I
think so too
yeah I just um I feel like there's just
more friendly dog stories than there are
a cat stories like you can't tell a good
cat story
we shouldn't even do this one cuz dog is
gonna crush so much not even worth it
yeah like there's no question here you
know I'm saying like it's worth it was
worth having the conversation so I can
make my point about how for a lazy ass
person you want to get a cat not a dog
you know what I mean like it's worth it
Rand Paul went on CNN's State of the
Union on Sunday and he was asked about
Trump's new pick for Secretary of State
and his new pick for CIA head and ran
decided to resist Trump harder than the
Democrats are resisting Trump so let's
watch and then we'll discuss new
nominations by the president for
Secretary of State and CIA director
you've said you're willing to do
everything you can to block the
nominations of Mike Pompeo for State and
Gina Haskell for CIA what are your
objections to the two and and what does
it mean when you say you're going to do
everything you can do to block the well
you know the president one of the things
I liked about President Trump and still
do like is that he continues to say the
Iraq war was a mistake
but when you say it's a mistake
basically what you're saying is that
regime change in the Middle East leads
often to unintended consequences well he
keeps appointing people around him who
loved the Iraq war so much that they're
ready for a war with Iran next and so I
don't think you really want people who
are eager for war to be running the
State Department you want a diplomat I
frankly think that Pompey owes positions
are too much of an advocate for regime
change really everywhere North Korea
Iran Russia you name it and I think
really we need to see the world as it is
doesn't mean we need to support what
happens everywhere in the world but I
don't think our policy ought to be for
regime change and so I think Pompeo
really isn't a good fit to be a diplomat
or to be the chief diplomat with regard
to Haspel I think that you know what
America stands for is not torture you
know tortures the hallmark of
totalitarianism we should be that hope
for the rest of the world that people
who you know who want to resist
totalitarianism that you know they want
to be free from torture they don't want
to be free to torture and so I really
think that she's it's inappropriate to
put someone to the head of the CIA they
have so much power power to assassinate
power to spy power to collect all the
data on everyone in the world I don't
think the person running that agency
should be someone who ran a secret
prison in Thailand and will you
filibuster these nominations on the
Senate floor I'll do whatever it takes
and that includes filibuster I will try
to make a point to the American people
and
maybe the American people will rise up
and say you know we stand in solidarity
with those who seek freedom from torture
not the freedom to torture it's just
inconsistent with who we are as a people
to have someone run our spy agency that
has all these enormous power who was
intimately involved with torture and
from everything we're reading was
supportive of the policy and so no I
can't support that and I will do
everything I can including filibuster
you know filibuster doesn't stop anyone
the only way I would stop anyone is if
we convinced you know enough senators
and it would take actually a majority I
think in this case to actually stop
their appointment but you know when you
read through the tortured abort report
that senator Feinstein put forward I
would hope that she will stand up and
say enough Sanath we're not going to
appoint people who made fun of the
process and really one of the worrisome
things about Gina Hass bellas she was
also involved with destroying the tapes
there were actually videotapes of trying
to drown these people and torture them
and these videotapes were destroyed
years later the first she was involved
with the waterboarding and then years
later she was involved with destroying
the tapes there's no way in the world
that she should be running our spy
agencies with all of their power and
here's the pushback you're gonna get
congresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming the
daughter of former Vice President Dick
Cheney tweeted about you this week
saying quote Gina Haskell has spent her
career defending the American people in
homeland Rand Paul is defending and
sympathizing with terrorists unquote
your response you know juvett juvenile
but I think the the Cheney's both father
and daughter could spend a lifetime
trying to justify the thousands of
soldiers thousands of Iraqis who died in
the Iraq war which was an unnecessary
war made the Middle East less stable
emboldened Iran and really have been
wrong about every foreign policy
decision of the last four years so I
think when they're done explaining why
people had to die in Iraq why had people
had to be maimed in Iraq and why it
really made the situation worse the
changes can then stand up and try to
make some points about other foreign
policy but until they've proved that
they know anything about you know the
world I think probably that I'd just be
quiet
damn damn
I enjoyed every part of that so Rand
Paul is libertarian ish if you talk to
actual libertarians they'll be like no
he's not a libertarian but he's a
libertarian leaning and sometimes that
leads him to be more forward-thinking on
certain issues than almost all the
Democrats so that really is a testament
to the sad state of our politics when on
certain foreign policy issues and on
certain social issues we look to a
Republican senator from Kentucky to show
us the way forward and not the Democrats
and I would love with every fiber of my
being if the Democrats all decided to
get on the same page and use that same
rhetoric that Rand Paul just used
against Gina Haspel and against Mike
Pompeo and against the Cheney's if the
Democrats all got on the same page and
made all these arguments against them
then I think pretty much overnight you
would see the the opinion of the
American people towards these disastrous
nominees tank it would plummet everybody
would say why on earth no we're not
gonna nominate somebody who partook in
torture she she oversaw torture and then
she destroyed the tape she destroyed the
evidence after the fact we shouldn't be
talking about nominating her for CIA
head we should be talk about we should
talk about nominating her for cellblock
C I mean this is a war criminal without
a doubt and then when you look at Mike
Pompeo
I mean he said it Mike Pompeo is a guy
who's never met a war he didn't like
he's been begging for a confrontation
with Iran he's been begging for
confrontation with North Korea he's
super hawkish with Russia so and then
john bolton also i don't think they
brought up john bolton in that
back-and-forth there but john bolton has
now been moved in for a top national
security position he's Trump's national
security adviser
so this administration overnight went
from really hawkish to insanely hawkish
maybe the most hawkish administration
that we've ever had I mean you have
nothing but neocon Warhawk American
Exceptionalist fundamentalists that are
littered in this administration now and
you know Rand Paul says if I have to all
filibuster it oh that's great and then
also by the way john mccain that john
mccain is you know being treated for
cancer right now my guess would be he's
barely hanging on to life by a thread
but he said no under no circumstance
will ask porcini hospital and the issue
of torture is a super rare issue where
john mccain actually makes sense and you
want to know why he was tortured he was
tortured in vietnam so it since this
issue affected him directly this is a
rare issue where he's like no i'm
left-wing on this issue so you know
that's good i just wished the democrats
the democrats drive me nuts
chuck schumer came out with a statement
saying well we don't know if we're gonna
oppose them but if Mike Pompeo gets
appointed I hope he becomes he gets
tougher on Russia and Putin Oh God
so in other words we're not gonna really
block it I'm not gonna you know try to
rally the Democrats to all be on one
side of this and and defeat this
appointment but if and when he gets
appointed man he better be even more
hawkish you couldn't craft a dumber
argument than that I mean that just
shows in no uncertain terms the
Democrats have no backbone and they
they're not actually on the Left when it
comes to foreign policy issues and we've
known this for a while Syria when Donald
Trump bombed Syria as he's done multiple
times and of course I'm talking about
the Syrian government the response from
the Democrats actually was to support it
so corporate media came on themselves
and everybody's oh this is great Brian
Williams was like the beauty of our
missiles taking off it's
amazing fareed zakaria was like now he's
presidential and then the Democrats were
like yeah we support this what so we're
we're bombing 8 different countries
right now Donald Trump increased drone
strikes by 432 percent he just did an
executive order saying we're gonna
torture so we got all this stuff all
fertile ground for Democrats to say this
is immoral this is unethical this is
unamerican this is unconstitutional this
is barbaric this is savage and this does
not represent us we're gonna fight back
against this but instead what are the
Democrats do they agree they agree so
this is why we call it the meek
resistance the mik resistance votes to
give Donald Trump more NSA spying as
they say he's Putin's puppet well that's
a weird thing to do if you think he's a
agent of a hostile foreign power to let
him spy on everybody more without a
warrant in an unconstitutional way the
[ __ ] are you doing the mick resistance
is in favor of deregulating wall street
and now the mick resistance sits idly by
as war hawk neocon torturers get
appointed all throughout trump's
administration and we have to rely on
rand paul to to do the job that the
democrats are supposed to be doing
listen man I can't I really can't
describe strongly enough how terrible
this hawkish administration's because
they really do believe in American
exceptionalism and our Empire in in a
way that's fundamentalist in nature and
one time I remember Dick Cheney and Liz
Cheney wrote a an op-ed I think it was
in the New York Times about their
ideology and about American leadership
and as I was reading and it became clear
no this really does neoconservatism and
American exceptionalism really does
manifest as a fundamentalist religion
because it doesn't matter how much
evidence how much proof you show to
these people that are hawkish nough
surround the world has led to
destabilizing the world
killed massive numbers of civilians and
has just been a harmful force a poll
show people around the world say the US
is the biggest threat to world peace
they don't say Russia they don't say
Iran they don't say North Korea they say
the u.s. is the number one country
that's the biggest threat to threat to
world peace so it doesn't matter how
much evidence you show them their answer
is always the same
no no we need more US militarism around
the world and and whenever we torture
whenever we regularly Massacre innocent
civilians by the thousands doesn't count
doesn't count because we we mean well so
that that [ __ ] giant wet blanket
throw it over anything that we do it's
like what intentions we mean well so now
we can move on and we can keep doing the
same [ __ ] no no and thankfully Rand Paul
is standing up and arguing back against
it and you know how morally bankrupt
that crowd is the neocon crowd is
because look at the argument list Cheney
mate this is all they have left they can
never ever ever win on the substance
they just can't they just can't because
we've killed so many civilians created
so many more terrorists destabilized the
world so when you talk about the actual
issues that get obliterated so what did
she say about Rand Paul to try to fight
back Rand Paul is sympathizing with the
terrorists thank you for admitting how
morally bankrupt you are and how
honestly idiotic you are they're just
gonna smear you as being with the
terrorists you know this is going all
the way back to 2002 now when people are
like hey maybe we shouldn't do the Iraq
war oh I guess you're with the
terrorists what I mean what an
intellectually embarrassing pathetic
response that is but that's all Liz
Cheney has left
that's all Liz Cheney and Dick Cheney
and Paul Wolfowitz and Bill Kristol
who's been wrong about everything he's
ever said ever that's all they have left
because all Rand Paul has to do is point
out our record point out the facts show
how terrible our intervention has been
and their response is
Rand Paul likes terrorists that's what
he likes he likes terrorists so thank
you Rand Paul for resisting the way the
Democrats should be resisting and by the
way Democrats this is why they get
obliterated in countless elections then
they wonder why won't you vote for us
well because you're not doing your
[ __ ] job your job is supposed to be
to be the anti-war party your job is
supposed to be to argue for these
positions I mean we spend 100 billion
dollars a year maintaining nine hundred
military bases around the world why are
you not running on cutting those
military bases in half
taking that fifty billion dollars and
using that to go towards free college
here by the way it only cost sixty
billion dollars to do free college why
are you not doing that why are you not
arguing to save the money the 7 trillion
we spent in Iraq and rebuild our
infrastructure we get a grade of D plus
why are you not arguing to make it an A+
so you don't have any arguments as to
what you're for cuz you're not actually
for anything and then you wonder why did
we lose we you lost because you didn't
[ __ ] stand for anything and your party
is littered with corporatist neoliberal
war hawks
so it actually resists the shitty
policies as opposed to what are they
doing they're either resisting without
resisting and just making noises with
their mouths or they're resisting from
the right and they're saying Trump
should be more hawkish or they're just
yelping about stormy Daniels all day so
even if there is a giant anti Trump
backlash in this upcoming election
really it's just it's just rolling the
dice because you don't have a coherent
cogent argument to make to the American
people so it's just an anti-trump vote
and I've had conversations with people
where they're not even you know big-time
Democrats and they're like yeah I'm just
gonna vote down the line Democrat to do
a backlash against Trump but then guess
what so let's say we have this anti
Trump backlash and you got Democrats
let's say you get a Democratic
supermajority what good is that if they
end up doing right-wing policies anyway
and that's what happened the last time
when da when Barack Obama had a
democratic supermajority we didn't get
Medicare for all we didn't get free
college we didn't get a living wage we
didn't end the wars you know we got a
right-wing healthcare plan with an
individual
mandate Obamacare which was which was
originally Mitt Romney's health care
plan and was a health care plan that was
cooked up by the Heritage Foundation
which is a right-wing think tank so you
want people to vote for you [ __ ]
stand for something be populist left be
a social democratic party be a party
that's against imperialism but no we
have to again the libertarians man the
biggest you know hit or miss crowd out
there on economic issues you're like wow
you're the most ignorant [ __ ]
in the world aren't you but sometimes on
social issues you're like oh [ __ ] yeah
legalize drugs that's right or with
intervention you're like oh wow Rand
Paul is gonna stand up and fight back
more than the Democrats are and really
what should be the cases Democrat
Republican independent everybody
libertarian doesn't matter everybody
should be united against these people
because in the case of Jena Haspel she's
a lot criminal she she ran she was the
head of a torture outlet literally
literally ran a black site and then
destroyed the evidence
she should be in prison in prison but
when you have like Obama didn't
prosecute these people well now you just
made it hey there's two sides of this
issue and it's a matter of opinion are
you for or torture you against torture
well doesn't matter who knows who cares
it's a debatable issue it's like
abortion you're for abortion you're
against abortion it's debatable right oh
let's have that conversation it's like
the tax rate what should the tax rate be
should be thirty five percent should be
twenty five percent because Barack Obama
did not prosecute the war criminals in
the Bush administration now they all are
still accepted in polite society they're
all in the Washington elite bubble and
this is just like they don't bat an
eyelash or over this yeah Gina Haspel
and then they had the nerve to go out
there and say a woman a woman to be the
CIA had historic and this is Donald
Trump doing that this is Republicans
doing that and that's some Mick
resistance corporate Democrats doing
that a woman how are we gonna how are we
gonna vote her down she's a woman if you
value diversity over
war crimes i value diversity so much
that i don't care if you're a war
criminal as long as you are not a
straight white male it's okay well then
you're pathetic because you this is Mick
resistance this is Mick liberalism this
is Mick feminism and you basically have
become a caricature of the left and it's
sad but Rand Paul's leading the way on
this and I hope the Democrats hop on
board and there should be consequences
if they don't I'm sick and tired of
these Democrats on the most important
issues they back Donald Trump and then
they have the nerve to get mad at you if
you don't go vote for them no they have
to earn your vote and one way they could
earn your vote is if they stand up and
fight back against these neocon war hawk
American imperialist tortures
Tommi Lehren did one of her final
thoughts segments on Fox News and she
put on a clinic in shitty arguments and
straw Manning opponents like it or not
President Trump has done some
outstanding things for the people of
this country let me help you in your
delusional ban of impeachment hungry
fools understand let's start with the
economy Trump push through a tax cut for
eighty percent of American taxpayers and
one of the Democrats want to do raise
taxes American paychecks are getting
bigger under Trump and they want to fix
that seriously
the economy has also added more than two
million new jobs the black unemployment
rate is that just six point nine percent
the second lowest ever recorded öand
Hispanic unemployment rate was at just
four point nine percent last month just
a tenth of a percentage above a historic
low and here's the thing about new jobs
low unemployment and economic growth
they help all Americans black white
brown left right and center is that the
kind of accomplishment you want to
impeach President Trump is also
dedicated to protecting our homeland the
number of people caught trying to sneak
across the Mexican border has plunged to
a 46-year low and the percentage of
illegal immigrants arrested for criminal
activity across the country is up to 92%
and how about Isis remember them well
under this commander-in-chief they've
been decimated and control little
territory in the Middle East and despite
the hysteria over President Trump's
tweets and his quote tone North Korean
rocket man Kim jong-un has decided to
come to the table is it historic yes
is it impeachable No Trump's done all
this and more with virtually no help
from Democrats and you want to impeach
him for what keeping his promises your
little activist groups are shelling out
millions to stop a president who is
winning and you can't even give us one
solid and honest reason why have you
instead thought of donating your
millions to causes you say you believe
in instead of wasting it on a campaign
to destroy president you're simply
jealous of it's very obvious you're not
afraid Trump is a bad president you were
afraid because he's too good I don't
know why anybody would do that
like why she's arguing the way she's
argument arguing she's making the
arguments
she's making because it's not like
they're so bad that anybody who spends
like a little bit of effort can just
debunk and swat away each and every
point that she made so I don't know why
it's almost like because there's a lack
of substance she turns up the volume
it's old O'Reilly trick like I really
don't have anything important or correct
to say so I'm gonna be loud okay but
that doesn't change the fact that you're
making really bad points so let's go
through this now we'll start with the
biggest claim the real reason people
don't like Trump is too good as
president so they're jealous they're
jealous classic classic straw man you're
telling your opponents what you think
they believe as opposed to just
listening to them when they tell you
what they believe and then responding to
their point in an honest way what you're
doing is you're saying I'm going to tell
you what you believe and then I'm gonna
slap down that thing that I just
pretended that you believed even though
you don't believe it he's you say he's
too good at being president or he's he
makes Democrats jealous because he's so
good at being president I come on man
really we have to I have to take time to
argue against that I mean listen just
for starters just for starters
half of workers in America makes $30,000
a year or less okay now I went after
Obama because wages were shitty under
him too but they're also shitty under
Trump so I'm I'm open and I'm honest
about the flaws on the Democratic side
because I have no stake in this game I
have no horse in this race or dog in
this fight I'm just calling balls and
strikes and telling you like it is so I
think that's a problem I think it's a
problem we're currently bombing eight
different countries Tommy now under the
Constitution the president has to get a
declaration of war when we start a war
from Congress they haven't done that are
you okay with that you're okay with
alleges bomb eight different countries
and by the way Niger is one of those
countries disappoint the direct threat
from Niger against the you
homeland tell me you know where's the
evidence that they're about to attack
North Dakota there's no evidence Niger
or Yemen or any of these countries that
we're bombing are gonna attack us so
we're just needlessly bombing all over
the place
Donald Trump increased military spending
sixty billion dollars I have a little
bit of a problem with that especially
because we spend more than the next nine
or ten biggest countries combined
already on military so look I'm just
pointing out some basic things that I
have a problem with and it's not just me
it's many people on the left and this is
why we don't like President Trump I
don't like President Trump conceal it
heard his administration full of Goldman
Sachs lackeys thankfully he lost one of
them recently Gary Cohen but he replaced
him with Larry Kudlow who's just as bad
if not worse but he's doing Wall
Street's bidding I covered a story about
how he colluded with the predatory
payday loan industry to charge so that
they can charge nine hundred and fifty
percent interest they scrapped the rules
that were gonna go in place to clean up
that industry I have a problem with that
Tommy so don't tell me that my problem
with Donald Trump is that he's too good
at being president or you're Joe Soto
over him get the [ __ ] it no listen to
what we say to you and by the way this
isn't just me now I'm giving you of
course really good reasons to despise
Trump there are people who have shitty
reasons to not like him and I talk about
that all the time whether there's people
talking about stormy Daniels you know I
can't stand that or just the chaos in
his administration oh my god there's
been a lot of turnover in his
administration come on give me something
better than that nonsense cuz we all
know if it was a Democrat with high
turnover Democrats be like who cares or
if it was a Democrat around an affair
Democrats be like who cares Monica
Lewinsky there you go but listen there
are reasons to despise him and we all
know by the way that would Tommy Lehren
not care about it if there was a an
affair where a Democrat had an affair
with a porn star when she shut up about
it and say listen personal lives are
none of my business no she would be like
this is wrong and terrible oh my god
maybe we shouldn't pitch him over that
so she's a hack everybody knows she's a
hack and her arguments are so bad but
really too jealous the Democrats are
jealous about Trump and he's too good at
being president yeah
that's the problem Tommy that's the
argument you know the Democrats really
believe is [ __ ] he's so good at being
president I don't know how we're
supposed to respond Jesus
okay then she says she says at one point
oh you can't I'm working backwards by
the way in her claims
oh you can't give an on his reason for
impeachment actually listening I
personally I don't favor impeachment
because you're gonna get Mike Pence
anyway Mike Pence is just as bad as
Trump if not worse in the process of
impeachment you spend a tremendous
amount of political capital that's
distracting from things you should be
talking about if you're the Democrats
like Medicare for all in free college
and a living wage and stuff like that so
you waste political capital you get Mike
Pence anyway and also you rile up
Trump's base and make it much more
likely that Republicans come out big
time in the next election so there's
really a lot of reasons why impeachment
is not a good idea so I don't personally
favor impeachment but the idea that
there is not an honest reason for
impeachment is [ __ ] so for example
the emoluments clause the mayas Clause
of the Constitution says the president
can't be taking money from foreign
governments Donald Trump has a worldwide
Empire with his business he
unquestionably has taken money from
foreign governments in fact it's not
even controversial there's been
reporting on it so for example he took
two hundred and seventy thousand dollars
from top Saudi officials at his hotel
and then Wow look at that lo and behold
he gave them one hundred over a hundred
billion dollar weapons deal but it's not
just them it's the Saudi government the
Turkish government he has business all
around the world in fact in 12 different
countries he has businesses so this idea
that there's not an honest reason for
impeachment okay I just gave you one
the emoluments clause now you could
agree or disagree with that Tommy and
say I don't think it really meets that
bar but it's an honest reason where
somebody could have it a disagreement
with you and say no this is a legitimate
reason to impeach and then there's other
reasons too like the fact that his first
military raid as president killed an
eight-year-old American girl I mean that
again you don't you could say I don't
think you shouldn't peach over that but
that's an honest reason for impeachment
assassin
an American without due process in any
way
it's assassinating an American with a
drone of course you could impeach over
that and by the way it's an 8 year old
girl
it's an eight-year-old girl nonetheless
so this idea of there's no reason for
get the [ __ ] out of here of course there
are there are honest reasons for
impeachment I don't happen to favor
impeachment because of the reasons I
described but there are honest reasons
for impeachment now I admit most of the
Democratic rhetoric is stupid it's over
Russia and when it comes to impeachment
I mean old [ __ ] there babbling about
when they say that but any Democrats who
say emoluments that's an honest reason
for impeachment ok then she gives a
Trump credit for the fact that he's
gonna have a meeting with kim jeong-hoon
and implies like she was like getting
Kim jong-un to the table Democrats
haven't done that if Barack Obama did
sit down with kim jeong-hoon she would
have been the first person to say that
he shouldn't be doing that oh my god
you're treating these dictators as
equals you're doing appeasement you're
doing an apology tour for America and
how do I know that this would have been
the reaction from people like Tommy Lera
it was the reaction when Obama said he
would meet with Iran without
preconditions he's like yeah I'll meet
with Iran no conditions and people were
like oh how dare you right you're not
saying release [ __ ] political
prisoners they have as a condition for
how I can't believe you do that terrible
a peace mint they sit down with our
enemies we supposed to stand up to our
enemies and beat up and say I'm not
gonna talk to you well Donald Trump says
I'm gonna talk to North Korean leader
immediately Tommy learns like wonderful
amazing if Obama did the same thing she
was a terrible so again partisan hack
clown and just to be clear guys I on the
other hand I'm not a hypocrite on this I
told you I don't think the meeting with
Kim Jong hoon is gonna work but I still
think it's a good idea to do the meeting
because the alternative is Trump and
isn't band of neocon Warhawk idiots they
do a conflict and they start bombing
[ __ ] so I'd rather him talk to them so
it's just she'll twist anything to be a
good argument for Trump and Republicans
to be a reason to support Trump and
Republicans then she talked about Isis
being decimated this one is hilarious
now first of all the reason
and why Isis is dwindling at the moment
has nothing to do with the US and it has
everything to do with the Syrian
government who have been on the ground
fighting them non-stop the Kurds who've
been on the ground fighting them
non-stop the various militias in the
region including the Shia militias that
are fighting them non-stop so they're
real hard fought battles won on the
ground by the people in the region which
by the way is what we've been saying
should be the case all along that the US
should stay out stop wasting our money
our resources our lives and stop killing
civilians and let people in the region
take care of it and that's what happens
people in the region take care of Isis
and immediately Donald Trump of the
Republicans take credit oh it's me I've
done it it's so strong now think about
this as they're taking credit for
destroying jihadists Donald Trump just
did over a hundred billion dollar
weapons deal with Yemen with a Saudi
Arabia and he did that as Saudi Arabia
is doing a genocide in Yemen their
blockading the country not allowing in
medicine people are having cholera and
dying millions of people are starving
because they're blocking food from
coming in the country along with
medicine they're bombing hospitals
mosques schools and here's the most
important point there's been it's been
it's been documented that Saudi Arabia
they get these weapons and you know what
you know what they do with those weapons
oftentimes they send them to Syrian
rebels and they send weapons to militias
Sunni militias on the ground fighting
the Shia Houthi rebels in Yemen and
guess what they're jihadists in Syria
many of the rebels are jihadists in
Yemen the Sunni militias on the ground
are jihadists it's al Qaeda in many
instances so we are arming Saudi Arabia
they are arming al Qaeda in other words
jihadis al Qaeda are getting us made
weapons as we are arming al Qaeda
tommy'll Aaron has the nerve to say
trump defeating jihadists are you
kidding me there's an easy way to defeat
them they'd be they fold within a year
completely if we stopped arming Saudi
Arabia and all these questionable actors
throughout the Middle East
so she doesn't know what the [ __ ] she's
talking about and then she talks about
immigration immigration drop under Trump
actually immigration was also net zero
under Obama and you guys just pretended
it wasn't you got just acted like no no
immigration is not necessary under Obama
no there's a P porous border people are
pouring through [ __ ] immigration was
Net Zero from Mexico so they again is
twisting facts it's replacing what
should be solid arguments with just
anger and listen I'm not against yelling
obviously I yell all the [ __ ] time on
this show but you have to have substance
behind what you're saying she doesn't
then she talks about is one of my
favorite arguments black unemployment
rate Oh black unemployment rate there's
new jobs new jobs being created well
first of all there were new jobs being
created under Obama all the time in fact
he had over ten million jobs over twelve
million jobs created under his
administration now did Republicans give
Obama credit for that the private sector
job growth know they didn't know they
didn't now according to their own
ideology they should because they love
the private sector so private-sector job
growth is [ __ ] awesome but here's why
I didn't give Obama much credit for
those jobs created why cuz they were low
wage jobs higher paying jobs were
replaced with low-wage jobs under Trump
what's going on low wage job creation so
I'm not gonna give him a bunch of credit
for those two million jobs created I'm
not gonna give him a bunch of credit for
the lowest black unemployment rate or
anything like that because their shitty
jobs too how stupid is that Oh we'll
give you a job that's not even a living
wage in many instances and now [ __ ]
praise me like I'm wonderful
what no how about you pay people a
[ __ ] living wage how about that so
that's the part they'll never tell you
under Obama's administration they may
have made that point as a counterpoint
when somebody says hey Obama did a lot
of job creation then the Republicans may
have said yeah but they're low wage so
it's not as that's not a damning
statistic against us but whatever
they're in power now now all of a sudden
oh don't look at the fact that it's low
wage job creation just say it's job
creation job creation so it's good
[ __ ] stupid Democrats and then
finally and this really is the crux
of how misleading her shitty arguments
are she says about Trump's tax bill it
cut taxes for 80 percent of Americans
and the Democrats you know they want to
raise taxes well first of all no you're
wrong on both of those things okay so
first of all over a 10-year period
Donald Trump's tax bill raises taxes on
everybody that makes $75,000 a year or
less that's not me speaking that's the
CBO speaking that's every nonpartisan
analysis speaking that's the economist
speaking so it raises taxes on the
middle class and the poor over a 10-year
period okay
second of all 83% of the benefits go to
the top one percent 83% of the benefits
so Paul Ryan did this the other day on
Twitter he was like if somebody came up
to me and said I can afford you know I
can get lunch with the tax break you
gave me and he had to delete the tweet
why because people were like that is a
[ __ ] embarrassing point as the Koch
brothers literally are reaping billions
of dollars of rewards from this tax bill
billions you're rubbing in people's
faces that somebody could afford a lunch
and that's just in the short run like I
said the long run they net raise taxes
on everybody making $75,000 a year or
less so that is such a [ __ ]
misleading argument it doesn't take into
account the fact that over a 10-year
period all the tax cuts for the middle
class have a sunset provision on it
which means they run out you know what
doesn't run out all the tax cuts for the
rich are permanent they're permanent
corporate taxes went from 35 percent to
21 percent by the way that's at a time
when corporations are already paying a
historic low percentage of the tax
burden in the 1950s corporations paid
33% of the federal tax burden 33 percent
then by 2012-2013 they were paying about
nine percent so who you think's gonna
pick up the slack you're gonna pick up
the slack and the Republicans just hand
it over a tremendous amount of money to
the rich they gutted the estate tax
cut taxes for corporations in the rich
gave you a little [ __ ] tiny little
bit and then they're gonna take that
away so it's just totally misleading to
say 80% of Americans get a tax cut under
Donald Trump and then the idea that the
Democrats want to raise taxes [ __ ]
[ __ ] Obama made 90% of the Bush tax
cuts permanent now many Democrats didn't
like that but those 90 percent that he
made permanent were mostly on low-income
people so this idea of like the
Democrats want to raise taxes on regular
people that's nonsense
that's the only argument the republicans
have leaned on to try to make the case
that they're for the middle class even
though they're not for the middle class
so but again this is the kind of
nonsense that you get these are all
misleading arguments [ __ ] arguments
flat-out factually incorrect arguments
there's lies Biko mission lies by
so remember the big bank deregulation
bill that we discussed last week well it
was advanced last week and last night it
just passed the Senate now the optics on
this are absolutely unbelievable because
yesterday during the day you had a
national school walkout over gun
violence where students were demanding
action to get common-sense gun reforms
in place and the Senate responds by
deregulating wall street I mean I've
never seen a better example that's just
a microcosm that's a perfect
that's the quintessential example of how
gone our government is and how corrupt
and disconnected from the people it is
because you have nationwide protests
this giant movement of like we're gonna
get some basic gun reforms universal
background checks ban on high-capacity
magazines we're gonna walk out of school
in order to do this and the government's
like oh isn't that lovely
anyway let's give CEOs on Wall Street
more money and more power what and it's
gonna speed up the next crash so here
let me show you Public Citizen says the
following breaking 16 Senate Democrats
joined Republicans and passing the bank
lobbyists act a massive rollback of the
Wall Street reforms enacted after the
2008 financial crash and then they
continued here remember these names the
next time Wall Street tanks our economy
and taxpayers are left to bail out the
big banks and they show here all the
Democrats who voted with the Republicans
Joe Manchin of course Claire McCaskill
and then you have Nelson Peters Shaheen
Stabenow tester Warner Bennett Carper
Coons Donnelly Hasan Heitkamp Jones
Kayne Hilary's [ __ ] VP pick Tim Kaine
Jesus man and by the way the amount of
money that these Democrats take from the
financial institutions is mind-boggling
I mean they are swimming in Wall Street
cash and that's why they did this and
then after the fact they come up with
this [ __ ]
nationalisation that they used to
deflect an obfuscate when they're
questioned on it and they argue no no
see what we're doing is we have to work
with the Republicans in a bipartisan way
because America loves bipartisanship and
this actually gives us a better chance
of getting reelected oh it's not the
case that you know Democrats who win in
a red state like Doug Jones who won in
Alabama the Democrats in that state are
not sitting around and the Republicans
in that state are not sitting around
like you know it would be wonderful if
we had an even more corrupt system if we
gave the big banks and Wall Street even
more power nobody's saying that nobody's
saying that that's a [ __ ] argument
it's corporate Democrats going I have to
agree with the Republicans to get the
moderate voters in my state to get
reelected but the people who put Doug
Jones over the top
it wasn't moderate Republican voters it
was the base the Democratic base it was
women and people of color and poor
people who came out of the Woodworks to
go vote for doug jones and then the
second doug jones gets in power he stabs
them in the back I mean you couldn't
come up with the worst strategy it's a
guarantee that Doug Jones is gonna lose
in the next election now if doug jones
went in the opposite direction and he
voted in a populist left-wing direction
and he didn't deregulate Wall Street and
he tried to get the people of his state
free college and Medicare for all and a
living wage and strong unions if Doug
Jones fought for those things then the
base would come out to vote for him even
stronger next time and he has a chance
of winning and in that case you might
actually get some crossover Republican
votes if you are fighting for the people
because average your Republican voters
they don't what you think they're
sitting around going man we really got
to give Goldman Sachs more power no no
so they do this massively corrupt action
because they take a tremendous amount of
money from big banks in Wall Street and
then they lie to themselves and tell
themselves well no this is what my
[ __ ] voters wanted and this is I
think this is good because I'm being
more moderate I'm being more
every time the Democrats try this
strategy they get wiped out every time
every time whenever the Democrats run to
the right whenever they become more
moderate whenever they're more centrist
what that really means is they're more
corporatist and they're doing the
establishments bidding and listen you
ran the [ __ ] experiment Obama was a
neoliberal corporatist at the end of the
day he did some good things but a lot of
what he did was status quo [ __ ]
guess what Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi
definitely neoliberal corporatists and
the Democrats lost over a thousand seats
with that philosophy and that ideology
Hillary Clinton lost a Donald frickin
Trump a guy who's a fake populist what
more evidence do you [ __ ] need what
more this is proof but they don't care
because again that's the way the system
works the system is they're getting so
much money from big banks and Wall
Street that honestly they don't even
care even if they knew that this vote
would hurt them in the next election
which they probably don't know they
wouldn't care it's like okay well I got
to raise more money the next election
anyway so I got it I got to do this
bidding but I could be as good of a
person as I want to be as long as it's
not you know hurting my donors well then
you're just stabbing your own
constituents in the back and by the way
this is so shameful I want to show you
how the media is treating this so
Politico says the following Senate
passes deregulation bill scaling back
dodd-frank okay so far nothing
objectionable the bill which was years
in the making was a rare bipartisan
bipartisan accomplishment at a time when
Congress is gridlocked on almost all
major issues they described it as a rare
bipartisan accomplishment this is the
virus in mainstream media and corporate
media they have this built-in assumption
that they don't even realize is an
assumption which is bipartisanship is
good by definition because working
together and compromise is good by
definition
but it's not good by definition it
matters what's in the compromise what
are they agreeing on oftentimes
Democrats and Republicans agree hey
let's keep illegally bombing Syria that
doesn't mean that bombing Syria is a
good thing just because Emma Kratz and
Republicans in Washington agree the
content the substance of what they are
greeing on not only matters it's [ __ ]
everything in the conversation it's
absolutely everything and oftentimes
what you find is Democrats and
Republicans when they do agree they
agree to screw you so I'm in the rare
camp that says there's not too little
bipartisanship in Washington all
corporate media will say that's the case
there's too much bipartisanship in
Washington because most of the time when
Democrats and Republicans agree they're
coming to rob you for their donors so
this is what we're dealing with this is
what we're dealing with we're dealing
with a corporate Democratic Party that
happily crosses the aisle to deregulate
Wall Street which speeds up our next
crash and we're dealing with the media
that refuses to educate you and refuses
to call a spade a spade the whole job of
the media is supposed to be to give you
information and to educate you give you
the proper perspective in context on
what's happening any journalist who does
the bare minimum of what they're
supposed to do would say the Senate
deregulate votes to deregulate Wall
Street this kind of legislation led to
the Great Depression and the stock
market crash in 1929 and led to the
subprime mortgage crisis and the Great
Recession in 2008 historically whenever
you deregulate and cut taxes for the
rich which is exactly what we've done
anytime you do that you have what's
called a boom bust cycle so everything
takes off and it was like oh my god the
economy is great the good times are
never gonna end and then the bubble
burst and then everything tanks I mean
we just went through this
we [ __ ] just went through this and by
the way dodd-frank all it was was a
band-aid with a little bit of mint over
a gaping gangrenous
and that didn't really fully address the
root problem with what was going on I
mean we didn't even get after the 2008
crash we didn't even get glass-steagall
implemented we couldn't even get
glass-steagall I mean that was a
no-brainer all you have to put back in a
place glass-steagall we even get that we
got this watered down giant loophole
bill dodd-frank which is barely a half
measure if that and now they're trying
to take away every single decent part of
that that remains by the way in this
bill we discussed it in the last segment
but just to give you an idea they
weakened the leverage rules of course
one of the main things that's going to
lead to another problem now they define
a small Bank anything that 250 billion
dollars worth or less it was 50 billion
dollars or less and it used to be that
banks it had 50 billion or more while
they're gonna be regulated more strictly
so that we don't we make sure that we
don't take risks that are gonna crash
the [ __ ] economy again well now they
said no let's up that cap from 50
billion to 250 billion and they say it's
okay because we're only we're only
making life easier for small community
banks community what the [ __ ] are you
talking about you know who one of the
companies are that benefits as a result
of this that small community institution
known as American Express so they're
just they're gonna [ __ ] crash the
economy again they just put it on
steroids and human growth hormone
we were already gonna face another giant
crash now it's just gonna come even
sooner and they act like this is the
right thing to do cuz my donors paid me
to do it shameful listen the humanist
report made a great point about this on
Twitter he said when it crashes again
all the senators who voted and the
Congress people who voted to deregulate
further have them pay for the entire
bailout have them pay for it cuz what's
gonna happen is it's gonna crash again
and they're gonna come begging to the
American people to tap theirs well we
got a well we have no choice who could
have seen this coming this crash who
could have seen it coming and now we
have to bail them out how about go [ __ ]
yourself how about you bail them out how
about that because we already
about once and we got hosed in the
process regular people haven't gotten a
raise since 1980 our wages have been
stagnant since 1980 half of workers in
America make $30,000 a year or less and
the greed and recklessness of Wall
Street they crash the economy bankrupted
their own companies and then the
government goes well since they pay us
our political donations we're gonna make
regular people bail them out so just
regular taxpayers with normal jobs oh
please if you own a [ __ ] deli or if
you own a dry cleaners or you own a
small grocery store and you go under
government doesn't come in and [ __ ]
rush to help you but if you own a giant
hedge fund and you're making casino
capitals bets and then you crash your
own company and the economy we have to
turn around and bail you out
[ __ ] that [ __ ] are you kidding me but
this it's gonna happen again
it's gonna happen again it's gonna
happen again it's gonna happen again and
shame on the [ __ ] Democrats they
couldn't have gotten this done if it
wasn't for the Democrats they couldn't
gotten it done and the [ __ ] media
describes it as a rare bipartisan
accomplishment how lazy how lazy do you
have to be as a journalist to not do
basic research to find out that
historically deregulation crashes the
economy it happens time and time and
time again cut taxes for the rich
deregulate giant crash it happens all
the time
and the media instead of educating you
it's just discussing this it's an
accomplishment cuz Democrats and
Republicans agree I don't give a [ __ ] if
Democrats and Republicans agree
have you noticed by the way that
Congress has an approval rating of
anywhere between 14% and 21% have you
noticed that have you noticed that is
that an accident or all the American
people wrong about what they think about
DC or are they right because they know
on some level they're being screwed and
we always keep voting for the lesser of
two evils
and we're voting for different groups of
corrupt people hey which donors are
going to win this time around the
Democratic donors or the Republican
donors and by the way there's a lot of
crossover because big pharma and
for-profit health insurance companies
and wall street donate to both of them
the military-industrial complex too
donates to both of them so we know
they're representing their donors are
not representing us and the [ __ ]
media is not pointing out what's goddamn
obvious and people have to come to
YouTube to shows like mine some random
[ __ ] with the microphone they have to
come here
for me to explain this basic [ __ ] to
them how sad is that because you're not
gonna get the answer you're not gonna
get people saying pointing out the
obvious and shitty outlets like Politico
cuz you got all you got
oh you got a cool 50/50 and that's what
they did in the article by the way
they're like well Elizabeth Warren says
this move is bad because hey it might
lead up to the next crash but the
Democrats who voted for it said oh
that's misleading and their point is XYZ
tell us who's [ __ ] right tell us
who's right but they're not gonna tell
you who's right because they want to do
the uh-huh [ __ ] neutrality bias and
establishment bias and by the way I saw
an article Bob Woodward legendary
journalist but you know what he said
oh I you know I I'm an objective
journalist because I don't pick sides
Bob that's not objectivity
that's not objectivity objectivity is
telling the truth no matter what
that's what objectivity is means it
doesn't matter how many people I piss
off it doesn't matter how partisan my
rant might be it doesn't matter if I'm
being clear and saying this side is
right in that side is wrong objectivity
is telling the truth no matter what what
Bob whatever it is describing his
neutrality he's saying hey I don't pick
sides it Who am I to judges that this
side says this at that side says that
who am I to judge
that's 50/50 that's a neutrality bias
and that's [ __ ] because that means
if somebody comes along to give an
extreme example here but it illustrates
it perfectly if somebody says two plus
two equals four and somebody else says
two plus two equals 22 Bob Woodward's
idea of objectivity is I'm just gonna
tell you that one person said two plus
two equals four and this other person
said two plus two equals 22 I'm not
gonna make a value judgment but that's
the [ __ ] problem as a journalist must
give information and educate people and
if you're educating them you say by the
way the guy who says two plus two equals
twenty two is wrong wrong but they're
not doing that and in fact if anything
they skew the article in the other
direction because the framing is you
know this is a rare bipartisan
accomplishment
so the opposition party is not doing
their job the corporate Democrats are
going along with the Republicans and the
media is not doing their job they're
muddying the waters I feel like we live
in the [ __ ] Twilight Zone I feel like
we live in the Twilight Zone because
we've seen this unfold again and we're
going right through the same steps and
it's gonna [ __ ] happen again and
anybody with a brain knows it
Donald Trump fired his Secretary of
State Rex Tillerson now Rex Tillerson of
course was the CEO of ExxonMobil before
he was picked to be Secretary of State
it was a giant scandal in the first
place in my mind that he was approved in
fact I went I was raging against the
fact that he was approved but what's
interesting is why Donald Trump fired
him so let's listen to Trump tell us in
his own words Rex and I have been
talking about this for a long time we
we've got along actually quite well but
we disagreed on things when you look at
the Iran deal I think it's terrible I
guess he put it was okay
I wanted to either break it or do
something and he felt a little bit
differently so we were not really
thinking the same with Mike Mike Pompeo
we have a very similar thought process I
think it's going to go very well Rex is
a very good man I like Rex a lot I
really appreciate his commitment to the
service and I'll be speaking directly
over a long period of time so there's
this crackpot theory going around that
Trump fired Rex Tillerson because he
criticized Russia the day before that is
100% factually incorrect because he's
replacing Rex Tillerson with Mike Pompeo
who was Trump CIA head now he wants them
to be Secretary of State
but Mike Pompeo is an even bigger Russia
hawk than Rex Tillerson so you don't
replace a guy who criticized Russia over
that issue and then replace him with a
guy who's an even bigger critic of
Russia so honestly that's just the
dumbest [ __ ] you know this is Russia
gate this is the [ __ ] hysteria that
people make up these crazy theories then
they run with it and they're like that's
it we nailed it that's what it is well
if you stop for two seconds to see who
he was replacing him with you would have
realized what no that theory doesn't
make sense because Mike Pompeo routinely
regularly and harshly criticizes Russia
in the most vituperative ways you can
imagine so that's just wrong that theory
now
the real scandal here is that Mike
Pompeo is even worse than Rex Tillerson
and this is what we're finding is that
the people who end up believing the
Trump administration nine times out of
ten whoever they're replaced with is
even worse so I want to remind you guys
about Mike Pompeo so he is Pro torture
that seems like a big deal to me he was
the head of the CIA now they wanted to
be the Secretary of State he is Pro
torture he doesn't hide that fact he's
very upfront about it and I love how now
it's a debatable issue in the United
States as to whether or not we should
keep doing torture thank you for not
prosecuting the bush-era war criminals
President Obama and your administration
it's it's supposed to be a non-issue
it's supposed to be non-negotiable
international law bans torture the
Eighth Amendment of the US Constitution
bans torture because it protects from
cruel and unusual punishment by now
since we didn't prosecute the war
criminals it's hey whatever it is what
it is I mean some people say it's okay
some people say it's not okay in world
we're also going to do this shitty tap
dance where we say it's enhanced
interrogation even though the techniques
were literally taken from a communist
Chinese manual on how to torture so Mike
Pompeo is a soulless [ __ ] who's in
favor of torture he also wants more NSA
spying again here are the things that in
my mind are really scandalous but they
don't get treated as such I can't think
of a more scandalous position we already
have all of your metadata being stored
in a multibillion-dollar NSA facility in
Utah and he goes no that's not enough I
want the government to be able to spy on
you even more and get even more of your
information so you just don't believe in
fourth member protection from
unreasonable search and seizure I've
been talking about Mike Pompeo for about
two minutes and we already have two ways
in which he brazenly disregards the
Constitution it doesn't believe in the
Constitution he doesn't believe in a
protection from unreasonable search and
seizure or protection from cruel unusual
punishment or a right to privacy and now
this guy they want him to be the
Secretary of State
he's also Pro gone
Tana MoBay and says it's really
important right really important have an
extrajudicial prison where you hold
people illegally so now three things in
the Bible inked and named we named three
things that Mike Pompeo despises about
the Constitution he also said that
Edward Snowden should be killed because
that's a great way to treat an American
hero who's showing how the government is
acting in an illegal fashion and
violating the Constitution Edward
Snowden is a textbook whistleblower
Daniel Ellsberg who gave us the Pentagon
Papers which we all agree now was
something we all should have seen how
our government was massacring civilians
in Vietnam now everybody says Ellsberg
is a hero but idiots in Washington still
say that Edward Snowden is a traitor and
he did treason and he should be killed
and now again Secretary of State they
want to give this guy even more power
and of course he wants to end the Iran
deal and this is what Trump says is the
crux of the issue how Rex Tillerson was
like okay look I may not like the Iran
deal but we're gonna keep it in place
because the deals done and it adds a
level of stability Trump's an idiot
who's like no I want to blow it up and
Mike Pompeo is somebody who agrees with
Trump so hey isn't that wonderful we're
replacing ya who probably was already
somewhat hawkish Rex Tillerson with
somebody who's an even bigger neocon war
hawk so that the real scandal is holy
[ __ ] the administration is somehow
getting even worse it was terrible to
begin with and Rex Tillerson should have
been approved to begin with but you're
gonna put Mike Pompeo as Secretary of
State I mean this is and so you might
say well okay Kyle maybe they're equally
bad
Pompeyo and and Rex Tillerson even if
you believe that you know who else is
now being brought into the Trump
administration to be a national security
adviser top national security adviser
John Bolton one of the guys who led the
charge in lying to the American people
to get us into the war in Iraq he lied
to the American people he is
the biggest talk in the country John
Bolton he wants to start a war not only
with Iran but with North Korea at the
same time while we're already bombing 8
different countries right now this guy
has literally never met a war he didn't
like he is a neoconservative
fundamentalist he believes in American
exceptionalism he believes in Americans
supremacism he wants us to be an
imperialist power and doesn't care about
the countless bodies we live we leave in
our wake so now he's being brought into
the administration as well so but it
gets even worse it gets even worse I
know it's already terrible but listen to
this now Gina Haspel was picked as the
new CIA director so some idiots Mick
feminists Mick resistance people go whoa
it's a woman now finally Trump's putting
a woman in a top position isn't that
great this is what happens when you mind
the mindlessly have diversity as a
virtue above all else you get duped by
grotesque head fakes like this see it's
a woman who we brought in there for
everybody shut up and you can't
criticize her right well here's what you
need to know about Gina Haspel Edward
Snowden tells us he or CIA director was
a key part of the torture program and
it's illegal cover-up her name was on
the top-secret order demanding the
destruction of tapes to prevent them
from being seen by Congress incredible
she directly partook in torture directly
directly she ran a CIA black site there
are detailed stories of her overseeing
the torture taking part in it again this
is what happens when you don't prosecute
war criminals now it's a debatable issue
hey fifty-fifty some people are for
torture some people are against torture
as long as it's us doing it if any other
country does it there
they're terrible and there
we need to do regime change ASAP do they
need to do regime change against us
because we did torture should some
country send you know special ops forces
into the White House to take it over and
do regime change cuz we're violating
international law that's what we say
when other countries break international
law should that be done against us now
but now it's not just that hey it's
whatever it's a debatable issue now the
war criminals are being honored and put
in to top government positions yet again
yet again she she took part in the
torture and then destroyed the evidence
after the fact unbelievable now you
might stop here and go okay okay but
this is so bad that clearly we have the
hashtag resistance is gonna stand up on
this one and fight back and not let any
of these people get confirmed right you
see where this one's going writers
Justin Schumer says at this point he is
not calling in Democrats to oppose
Pompeo and Haspel I think I suppose a
not calling on Democrats to oppose
Pompeo and Haspel but wants to hear from
them first what now it's even worse than
that because look at what he says the
instability of this administration in
just about every area weakens America if
he's confirmed we hope that mr. Pompeo
will turn over a new leaf and we'll
start toughening up our policies towards
Russia and Putin paratus exactly what
I've been warning you about all this
[ __ ] time corporate Democrats they
have no answer they they either resist
without resisting no we're not gonna
stop these two we're not gonna
oppose them we'll hear from them first
before we make a decision that's
resisting without resisting and then the
other half the time what do they do
resist
from the right they go oh if Pompeo is
approved he better be more hawkish with
Russia
he better be tough he needs to turn over
a new leaf and start toughening up our
policies towards Russia and Putin that's
gonna be the stance you take we've
already slapped sanctions on them out
the wazoo we have a NATO buildup on
their border right now we have our
military ships are in the Black Sea
right by their border we've had multiple
occurrences where planes were this close
to having a disaster Russian planes and
US planes u.s. flying near their
airspace Russian planes flying near us I
mean we're really flirting with disaster
any resistance party that's supposed to
be the anti-war party that's supposed to
be the Left Party would say what the
[ __ ] are your ships doing in the Black
Sea get him out of there what are you
doing with the NATO buildup on his
border we're gonna accidentally spark a
[ __ ] hot war a conflict here get out
of there what the [ __ ] are we doing
we're supposed to believe in peace and
negotiations and even when we disagree
with people try to find a way to
de-escalate but no now the party that's
supposed to be the left-wing party is
supposed to be the anti-war party's like
you need to be even tougher be even
tougher be more hawkish what are you
doing I mean literally Rachel Maddow did
a segment where she came out against
Donald Trump having talks with with
North Korea now I get it the talks
aren't gonna go well that's a given we
get that but you should still be okay
with the talks because if we don't have
the talks what's left you know what this
neocon Hawk administration is gonna do
and they're getting even more hawkish by
the minute and if they're not gonna talk
with North Korea what's gonna happen is
some sort of a conflict so you have to
stop resisting from the right because it
just shows their you're unscrupulous you
have no morality you have no ethical
code you don't actually believe in
anything you don't actually have
policies that are a desired outcome so
you know when a guy like Jeremy Corbyn
comes along in the UK and Bernie Sanders
comes along in the US and they actually
believe in something and will
fight for something they become
massively popular politicians because
are the only people actually saying
something real everybody else is just
politically posturing I don't know I
guess it makes sense for me to resist
without resisting or resisting from the
right it these corporate Democrats are
the worst you're given a situation where
a neocon Warhawk Pro torture a person
who despises the Constitution Mike
Pompeo they want a secretary of state
you're not even gonna resist that and
you're not gonna resist a war criminal
herself being appointed to lead the CIA
when she did the torture and then
covered up for the torture if you're not
going to resist this what the [ __ ] are
you good for what are you good for
but again I'm yelling at the same people
you know Democrats corporate Democrats
voted to give Donald Trump more NSA
spying power so what are you good for
what are you good for if we vote in the
opposition party you guys and you do
what the Republicans want you to do
anyway why the [ __ ] would people vote
for you if they're if you're not
actually gonna give us another option
we're gonna cover story in a little bit
corporate Democrats just deregulated
Wall Street again it was a dozen
corporate Democrats cross the aisle to
agree with the Republicans on what
[ __ ] planet is being a corrupt
sellout and being Republican light the
desired result on what planet do you
think that's gonna get you reelected
doug jones from alabama won because poor
people and women and people of color all
came out to vote for him the second he
gets an office he stabs them in the back
and speeds up the next economic crash
which is gonna disproportionately affect
those same people that just voted for
him so what the [ __ ] are you doing what
are you doing
you have the republicans and donald
trump that are so far gone that they
celebrate the idea celebrate the idea of
getting torturers and positions of power
war criminals and positions of power
outright authoritarian lunatics and
maniacs in position of power and then
you have the corporate democrats who go
right along with them and say you know
when the war criminals get a
they better be more hawkish against our
enemies I'm telling you I don't think
people really understand how this era in
history is gonna be described in the
history textbooks you know these people
in Washington men in DC they think
everything's all hunky-dory they really
have no idea the resentment and the
anger among regular people and they have
no idea how the rest of the world looks
at the lawlessness of the United States
the lawlessness the authoritarianism the
imperialism everybody looks at us like
this [ __ ] rogue state of crazy people
the United States repeatedly polls as
the biggest threat to world peace versus
every other country when you pull people
all around the world the United States
wins by a mile and a half they don't say
Russia is the biggest threat to world
peace
they don't say North Korea is the
biggest threat to world peace they don't
say Iran's the biggest threat to world
peace
they say the United States is the
biggest threat to world peace because
they actually see what we're doing
objectively
because they're not in the belly of the
beast but here in the belly of the beast
one party says I can't wait to just
nominate all these war criminals it's
gonna be [ __ ] wonderful and the
opposition party goes yeah but those war
criminals better be even more hawkish
all they just opened up the NCAA joint
with UCLA cheerleaders and nothing
better than that
welcome to the show everybody
Kylie horn all up in yes I'm now here
with the famous Kyle kolinsky oh yeah
because the Joe Rogan thing we're saying
that it'll roll game TYT yeah there's
fun Matt even wanted to take a picture
with celebrities cuz you're a celebrity
you uh we we already told everybody the
story about the guy from the office but
I was pretty cool when we just used him
standing in front of the hotel we were
like oh [ __ ] is this [ __ ] yeah I noticed
him immediately that I had seen him
elsewhere but I didn't I didn't I didn't
know his name it didn't click exactly
where I knew him from I would say he's
like a C plus B minus star I mean like
um I would say probably Rogen's bigger
than him but that's cuz Rogan is like
the number one podcast on the Internet I
think I think if they're both walking
down that he gets recognized more the
other guy I think the other guy gets
recognized more than Rogan just Casey
right maybe you're right maybe I'm
biased cuz I would recognize Rogan over
the other guy yeah but you're right I
mean he was in the office in the office
was like one of the top shows right
mm-hmm and I mean I think they have that
internationally been like
don't underestimate like a Hot Tub Time
Machine I saw that like a huge movie and
he had a big role well John Cusack
retweets me every now and then oh yeah a
Q sexy big into politics oh so I wonder
if he so he definitely had to see that
we met Craig Robinson and that whole
like [ __ ] we don't know he doesn't
follow me on Twitter but he retweets my
[ __ ] every now and then so I think he
sees somebody who follows me he follows
and that person retweets me all the time
and then they retweet the retweet
wouldn't you automatically think he
would give you a follow them all right
but he doesn't and I was like all right
he retweets me like once a month and
it's and he doesn't follow me it's like
all right John fine no no offense taken
I don't follow him either
that's so weird that's like
um Cam Newton did it so good one time he
was doing a press conference and one of
the reporters was like cam we saw on
your Instagram that like you know you
might have hurt your foot or something
or did this this past week and he was
like he was like oh you saw that he said
but do you follow me
and he I was like now I my assistant
showed it to me and he was like oh so
you don't follow me but you saw my post
and then the guy was like well my
assistant he was like so here ghost
follower and then like the guy was like
and cam was just like I guess he was
playing around but sort of being real
cuz that [ __ ] happens a lot like people
hate and they don't want to give a
follow or some [ __ ] you know that's all
right I don't really give a [ __ ]
actually I would I shouldn't even be
saying that because it's before I had a
hundred thousand followers I was a
little bit like alright get me over that
hundred number you [ __ ] I'm saying
so if you don't I had ninety nine
thousand four hundred and some-odd
followers I would have been like [ __ ]
you John Cusack you retweeted every
eight seconds and you're not good
following me do have isn't it so weird I
mean like you have so many followers
that like there's a random Alexandre in
there somewhere that like she likes you
[ __ ] yeah of course there's probably so
many people yeah but but I mean the
crazy real crazy thought is think about
you know my level of being known versus
somebody who's really really known like
they hit me versus like I have what 115
thousand Twitter followers or something
like that yeah and like think about like
Justin Bieber he has like over 30
million or some crazy [ __ ] you know but
it's so it's it's like that's really
famous that's yeah that's what I'm
looking at that dynamic there's a
hundred and fifteen thousand people that
know you and you might know like oh no
I'm Way off 27 of them he has 106
million followers
goddamn like that's just that's just
you're gonna lose your [ __ ] mind at
that point you know how do not lose your
mind at that point well lose your mind
in what sense what do you mean cuz you
gotta you have to feel grounded as a
human being but if everywhere you go
people look at you like you're a Martian
because that's what he gets everywhere
he
people look at him like he's a Martian
yeah or zoo animals the [ __ ] exactly
kazoo animal exactly like oh [ __ ] but
like there's something about somebody
looks at you just like yeah you're Dave
yeah that that makes somebody go like
okay that's like that's what everybody's
used to that's what everybody's used to
feeling that feeling of anonymity like
you can't ever he can't I mean he slips
up all the time because he's an idiot
but actually that Feridun he's young as
[ __ ] and he doesn't what the [ __ ] he's
doing but you know no he knows what he's
doing [ __ ] him you think so I think he's
yeah he's not not like young and naive
man he's got like he's been to too many
business meetings
he's interacted with too many people in
different countries and like even
through that if that [ __ ] is filtered
like you still got to get it
understanding for people and like know
how [ __ ] works we're like I thought the
people don't even get to talk to it like
people from other countries and [ __ ]
when you're famous from that young of an
age though because when he was a kid he
became famous mm-hmm that's got to [ __ ]
you up I mean look at the track record
look at all the people that that
happened to where they lost their minds
completely like who's the person who had
life has like a cult now who was that a
cult yeah Corey Feldman is that his name
oh I think that's his name Corey Feldman
from like the he got like molested by
Michael Jackson right supposedly I think
in on that um Michael Jeff I think he
was a Michael Jackson fan favorite Corey
Feldman's the guy I'm thinking of yeah
like there's a bunch of child actors who
lost their mind sometimes they get their
mind back like it you know what happened
with Miley Cyrus Culkin Oh Miley Cyrus
yeah Macaulay Culkin what's-her-face the
girl from Nickelodeon Amanda Bynes lost
my mind unless you got it back but like
some people lose it and get it backs and
then some people just lose it it
something happens when you're if you're
in the public eye before you're
developed at all as a human being then
like at a certain point it's almost like
they have a they have a crisis of
identity where they're like I didn't I
didn't really sign up for this when I
was a kid for my wall you know who the
[ __ ] I was so now I want to redefine
myself look at Shia libéré
yeah he got [ __ ] blinking he at a
certain point we was like no you're not
gonna look at me as even Stephens
anymore I'm gonna be the [ __ ] like
I'd be a badass I'm gonna be there it's
like and you screech screech you could
always tell when they're
overcompensating too like when Miley
Cyrus was trying to be a bad girl he's
like shaking her ass up on [ __ ] Robin
Thicke and stuff it's like playing so
hard like reel it in a little bit she
could reel it if she reeled it in like
90% back then that that would have been
like okay she's acting a little edgy but
she went so far past edginess that she
came all the way back around or just
being corny as [ __ ] you know what I mean
yeah yeah she went so far over the line
that it was like no now you're not even
over the line you're just stupid
yeah the [ __ ] she was doing was weird
and I think I mean I think though we all
go a little crazy it's just their [ __ ]
is magnified that's a lot yeah that's
good that's good that's a more kind
analysis of them that's probably true
man it's not like people like we're
human beings and all of us go through
phases and go through stages and it's
just my friends in high school that did
shrooms or something like that but if
they were a Hollywood star yeah then you
see them with their long hair some shade
to be like Oh going crazy yeah I don't
know but they it's the parents that
[ __ ] really [ __ ] the kids up and like
the parents are the sicker ones that no
attention really goes towards that like
Lindsay Lohan's parents are the sick
ones that really got her into that [ __ ]
young and [ __ ] up her mind and all
that stuff and then turned [ __ ] her up
but no one talks about her parents cuz
that doesn't sell [ __ ] newspapers or
whatever yeah it's a good point I mean
it the evidence looks pretty clear on it
that if you have fucked-up parents
you're gonna have massive issues but you
know I always struggle with I don't know
how much of it is the parents and how
much of it is them individually yeah you
know what I mean because I had a [ __ ]
technically a broken home because my
parents divorced and I don't feel like
it [ __ ] me up but then again who knows
maybe if i sat with some expert they'd
be like you're [ __ ] up yeah writing
about it or some [ __ ] like that and
telling you different you know sides of
stories and all that yeah it's crazy how
much influence
Aran's have over kids like and that's
just how the cycle works it's like I'm a
Knicks fan so my daughter is gonna be a
Knicks fan you know it's not it's not
until I get old that's true and you're
totally helpless until you're a certain
age yeah until you're like until you're
like 16 minimum you're helpless like
you're just cuz what age can you legally
start working I think it's like 16 or 17
or something like that yeah 15 16
something like that something in there
so like until you till you could work on
your own like and until your brain has
matured to a certain point until you
physically mature to a certain point
you're just like a [ __ ] you know like
a baby deer when it's on the shaky legs
and [ __ ] like that's what you're like as
a human being it takes humans so long
before they develop but then once humans
develop then they're you know by far and
away the most expansive and intelligent
beings versus other animals like there's
some animals you know I think elephants
like they [ __ ] the Alpha now and it's
just walking already like so they did
that on on Impractical Jokers it was a
cow and like a full-sized [ __ ] baby
cow came out and then they just start
walking they start walking just like
what the [ __ ] we look at a baby baby
doesn't walk until how old you know one
two something like that
did you see the ABC video I think was
ABC News of like a gorilla or something
like that like someone threw a cigarette
in the in the arm and it's it was in a
zoo
someone threw it like a cigarette and
the big-ass gorilla or whatever it was
like picked it up and just started
smoking it no and like brought it down
well you like brought it back up what's
so crazy is that they are superhuman
like there's some animals that you look
at them and you're like they're so
similar to us that it's mind-blowing
like sometimes you see a facial
expression on a dog and you're like yo
you're basically human sometimes you
look at you know chimpanzees or gorillas
like you were mentioning like and
genetically or in their DNA it's like
really really really really really close
to us like 99 points something you know
close to us so maybe we aren't that
special I was just talking about how
we're the most intelligent but there are
other
pretty intelligent you know beings out
there Helia I heard it on some podcast
it was like if you put just four people
ago was it maybe might have been Rogen
like for people's ago is when like we
were riding in wagons and just not that
smart
Oh like you know there there's like a
grandkid of one of the first 10
presidents or some [ __ ] that's still
alive today he's in that crazy I think
that's the fact was Zachary Taylor was
the president let me let me look this up
as we talk here know any of the
presidents are listen I know I know a
decent amount about the presidents and
once I get past a certain era and once
you put me too far back
I don't know I'm either no it's not it's
not easy because there's you know
there's a lot of them and you know US
history is we you know 1776 was pretty
much when it all started and then it's
yeah it's nuts to think that they all
like we're trying to accomplish some
[ __ ] and then eventually like they just
died and whatever they were I've had
when I die there's gonna be a day where
I die and then all the like presidents
that come afterwards I'm not gonna know
anything about cuz I'm gonna be dead and
that made me sad it's like I see I can
see from you know what we know in
history books how far we've come so far
but then there's gonna be a day when I
die and I'm not gonna see how it ends
you know what I mean yeah and that's
just like [ __ ] like I want to be able to
check in and be like alright so who the
[ __ ] is your check-in on some [ __ ] that
you did and just be like okay that's
that's that's what happened and then you
go back to sleep forever like if the
forefathers came back with the they
would say like what thing with the
Second Amendment they just like oh no no
that's not what we meant at all you sure
what they shoot how many bullets per
minute they have a bear who ripped off
another Bears arms or some [ __ ]
just like that cement my beer oh yeah I
tweet tweeted like a picture of that one
time you have the right to bear arms
that shows literal bear arms so here's
the fact by the way a tenth president Oh
John
Tyler's grandsons are still alive so the
Tyler was the president yes the tenth
president he was and his grandson his
grandsons are still alive that was as of
2017
yeah that that's crazy that's a crazy
[ __ ] fact Matt I think I've said this
before but I had an ex-girlfriend who
knew she was pretty dumb pretty pretty
pretty dumb but she knew every president
buy a song yep well that's the thing if
you tie it to a song of course cuz
there's some songs you'll never forget
certain songs like they're in your head
forever yeah you know so if you tie in
whatever information you're trying to
put in the song then because of the fact
you know the song you're gonna learn the
thing you know what I mean it's almost
like that like if you put a pill in
applesauce and you have the applesauce
you don't even realize you just had a
pill you know what I mean
so you get the medicine you even know
you had the medicine that's what it's
learning through music cuz museum can
remember I wonder what that is with
music just like rhythm or something
we're more like easy to I don't remember
it's like I think my friend told me
something about music one time that blew
my [ __ ] mind I don't remember exactly
what he said but has something to do
with like math that there's some sort of
a some sort of a link between music and
math well that would make sense because
I think music goes in certain like
eighths and sixteenths and like certain
whatever parts of the song that you hit
and I know they say with like we can
remember I don't know what type of like
what pattern of numbers but we can
remember a certain saddest of numbers
like that's why we could remember a
phone number or something like that
because it's in a sequence of numbers
that we know like three and then four I
know what what the thing was but like
you could remember certain pockets of
numbers if it's in like like a type of
system yeah I don't know I know I know
what you're talking about I've heard
that before too so the music and math
thing I don't know if it's been proven
but
they say that there's like it's almost
like you have a brain map and it's
almost like you're wired to under to
understand and appreciate certain sounds
in certain order so when a song
resonates with you it's because it's
it's kind of triggering that brain map
and and so if you hear something notes
that are out of tune or whatever you
limb you know you immediately know it's
out of tune but like okay why is it out
of tune why does that thing sound really
weird and bad to us but this other thing
sounds good to us and it's pretty much
you know uniform across the board people
know when something flows and when
something is shitty yeah you could tell
when something's offbeat like yeah if
they miss a note so it's like well how
the [ __ ] is that the case because one
would think or you know it's a I would
have guessed it would be a reasonable
assumption to say no we create music and
just it's totally subjective but it's
like no it's not totally subjective
there is an element of it that's
subjective if somebody prefers you know
whatever classical music to pop music or
somebody prefers rap to jazz or whatever
the case is so some of its subjective
but only within a certain narrow like
scope because there if you put together
just a bunch of notes that don't go
together
if I try to play the piano right now and
I don't know how to play the piano
you'll be like that [ __ ] was terrible so
it's like uniform everybody agrees so
why is it that everybody agrees and it
has something to do with math and that's
something that's at least what how was
described to me I don't know if it's
true but it's an intriguing idea this
idea that like music has to I mean music
is something that's very innate in a way
because you could play music for kids
and they start dancing my little my
little nephew one years old one year old
you play music for him he starts dancing
yeah it's like well he didn't he's one
year old he's just been [ __ ] himself
in eating this entire time like what the
it so it's an eighth like there's
something wired in us where that's like
you just react that way here's like the
rhythm and then you start moving with
the rhythm and stuff you see that I saw
there's so many of those videos of like
kids dancing to like the most popular I
think like turned down for
was one of them and then you see kids
rocking back and forth smile you're
right like they just hear sounds like
yeah and gotta be something that makes
people happy through good music yeah
there's something about that that's an
eight in the same way that you know sex
everybody knows sex feels good yeah you
know like there's certain things you
know you have to eat to survive so the
member is tied to that too because I
know they say scent is the strongest
what is the scent is the strongest sense
tied to memory I don't know if that's
true though I feel like I heard that in
a commercial yeah yeah it definitely
wasn't a commercial but I feel like it
could be true sure but you you I mean I
feel like I remember certain things from
smell like of course you smell something
and you're like it can take you back to
a damn now I remember 1999 I was going
to see a hockey game in New York City
with my dad and I smelled that soubrette
hotdog on the [ __ ] it up yeah of course
so maybe that with memory and music and
well this what we were talking about
when I was doing the Rogan podcast I
made a point about because he mentioned
you know ghosts and the fact that at the
Comedy Store somewhere it's like there's
President Trump did a rally yesterday
and during the rally he doubled down on
some comments that he made two weeks ago
in private now when I originally
discussed this story a lot of people
were like yeah and now it doesn't sound
believable doesn't sound believable I
don't think he actually said that I
don't think he actually believes that
and you know I got a decent amount of
[ __ ] for even reporting on it but I you
know I thought from reading the original
story that it sounded like Donald Trump
well now we know that the story was
definitely true because look at what he
says on the issue of drugs we're gonna
build a wall and we have to build a wall
for people for gangs for drugs the drugs
has never been a problem like we have
right now and by the way like the world
has do you think the drug dealers that
kill thousands of people during their
lifetime do you think they care who's on
a blue-ribbon committee the only way to
solve the drug problem is through
toughness when you catch a drug dealer
you got an you gotta put him away for a
long time when I was in China and other
places by the way I said mr. president
do you have a drug problem no no no we
do not I said huh
big country 1.4 billion people right not
much of a drug problem I said what do
you tribute that to well the death
penalty so hey if you're a drug dealer
and you know you're gonna get caught and
you know that you're gonna kill people
you're killing our kids they're killing
our kids they're killing our kids
they're killing our families they're
killing our workers but I said to the
president I said so you don't have much
of a problem
no and they had a problem you know if
you go back 200 years ago and they know
all about drugs it was devastating to
China the opium devastating it destroyed
China and I'm not gonna let it destroy
us and there was an article
one of the main papers maybe it was the
failing New York Times is one of them
and I don't even know where they get it
because honestly I don't know that the
United States frankly is ready for it
they should be ready for but at a
minimum you have to give long tough
sentences but if you go to Singapore I
said mr. president what happens with
your drugs
no we don't have a problem president I
said really why we have a zero tolerance
and he's not playing games these guys
don't play games you know we have a
different type of people they don't play
games I said how you doing on drugs no
problem
said what do you mean no problem and
that's entertainment you know a lot of
things are happening so what do you mean
Oprah we have a zero-tolerance policy
what does that mean that means if we
catch a drug dealer death penalty
[Music]
and they don't have a problem now
remember this if somebody goes and shoot
somebody or kill somebody they go away
for life and they can even get the death
penalty right one person they shoot one
person they get the death penalty they
shoot one person kill some person knife
one person the person dies they get
maybe the death penalty or maybe life in
prison no parole right okay a drug
dealer will kill two thousand three
thousand five thousand people during the
course of his or her life thousands of
people are killed or their lives are
destroyed their families are destroyed
so you can kill thousands of people and
go to jail for 30 days they catch your
drug dealer they don't even put him in
jail think of it you kill one person you
get the death penalty in many states or
you get life of Brisbane you think of it
you kill 5,000 people with drugs because
you're smuggling them in and you make it
a lot of money and people are dying and
they don't even put you in jail they
don't do anything but you might get 30
days 60 days 90 days you might get a
year but you're not gonna get and then
you wonder why we have a problem that's
why we have a problem folks and I don't
think I don't think we should play games
he's praising countries that execute
drug dealers that's it's not up in the
air it's not questionable it's not a
matter of conjecture it's not me reading
too much into the situation he's
praising countries that execute drug
dealers it gets even scarier
they are literally looking into how to
do this legally they've spoken to
officials from Singapore and said we
like what you do we think we want to try
this guys this is why a Donald Trump he
was praising Rodri
Duterte of the Philippines a leader of
the Philippines Duterte is currently
waging a genocide against drug dealers
and drug users there's been thousands of
people who've been murdered because
they're shooting drug users in the
street and Rodrigo Duterte doesn't even
hide this fact he's proud of it he's
proud of it in fact there are quotes of
him saying I really want the people who
are the family members of the drug users
to execute them but I don't think they
have the heart to do it and execute
their own loved ones so that's why we
need the police officer to do it and
don't worry if you do it we're not gonna
crack down on you if you do it we want
that Donald Trump is looking at these
authoritarian strongmen dictators and
going yes that's what I want that's what
I love so look at this this is deeply
authoritarian deeply tyrannical deeply
dictatorial and if you're somebody who
considers yourself a Republican or a
small government conservative you have
to understand that this is the biggest
government imaginable executing people
for selling a substance that tweak your
consciousness I've never seen a single
comment from a US president that's more
anti freedom than that I mean you know
freedom has a definition right I mean I
know politicians love to throw that
around just willy-nilly like oh I
believe in freedom freedom freedom
freedom freedom well here you have an
example of the exact opposite of freedom
Donald Trump wants to take away all of
your freedom to be able to tweak your
consciousness and understand of course
Donald Trump since he's a he's a clown
and he's an idiot and he's not smart and
he's certainly not objective
he doesn't realize that the the the
framework of his own society accepts
certain substances so for example
alcohol is a substance alcohol is a drug
you know caffeine is a drug a lot of
people don't think of caffeine like that
but it is a drug as is redbull as this
xanax that you get from a pharmaceutical
company so if you're talking about x'q
drug dealers are would you execute the
CEO of Budweiser would you execute you
know people who important sell coffee
would you execute the head of a
pharmaceutical company Merck would you
go you know knock down the door of the
CEO of mercs house or the owner of Merck
or the owners and drag them out would
you go execute the head of Purdue Pharma
now listen when you bring it up in that
context everybody recoils and they're
like what the [ __ ] are you talking about
you're gonna have somebody selling a
product which people buy willingly of
their own volition hey I'm gonna go get
this substance cuz I want to have a few
beers tonight or I want to have some
wine tonight or I want to have a couple
shots of Jack or whatever the [ __ ]
people willingly get that and then
you're gonna maybe execute the person
who's selling it I can't think of
anything more immoral than that but
Donald Trump thinks this is a good idea
and it's not even it's not this isn't me
reading in between the lines you're
looking too far into it this is what he
thinks this is what he thinks and what's
hilarious is he doesn't understand the
system that we currently have actually
leans in the direction of what he wants
to do so I don't know if you heard of
this thing Don but we have the war on
drugs going on we've wasted over a
trillion dollars in the war on drugs so
wasted over a trillion dollars we jail
more people than every other country you
have what millions probably of people at
least hundreds of thousands of people
probably millions of people behind bars
for nonviolent drug offenses so in other
words people who aren't actually
criminals they didn't do anything
violent they didn't break any laws that
really should be laws and they're you
know locked up behind bars right now we
have by the way we have tens of
thousands of people who've died in the
war on drugs because it's a literal hot
war on the border with Mexico and then
by the way you also make the drug
cartels much more powerful because of
the drug war because you make the
substance illegal you push it
underground and then guess what
the only people who are selling drugs
like marijuana and cocaine are drug
cartels so they have a monopoly on all
the money and that's why they get really
powerful that's what happened with the
Mafia
during Prohibition the Mafia were the
only people selling it and providing it
until they got really really really rich
so in an attempt to crack down on crime
and have law and order you actually made
crime worse you made crime worse cuz you
gave the bad guys all the money and all
the power that's what's happening now
with the drug cartels and this idiot is
like yeah we need a zero-tolerance
policy what the [ __ ] do you think it is
when you have more people locked up in
the US than anywhere else in the world
you wasted over trillion dollars on the
drug war drugs are illegal marijuana is
a schedule 1 drug which is comical
because schedule 1 means there's not
even the potential for a medical purpose
not even the potential for medical burrs
comical laughable ridiculous
so we already lean in the direction of
his dumbass ideas and he's like we
should go further oh my god by the way
Richard Nixon Richard Nixon one of his
top officials came out recently and said
hey you do know that we did this
specifically to crack down on black
people specifically to crack down on
hippies white hippies because we wanted
to criminalize their lifestyle because
we knew they weren't our constituency
they admitted this they they're on the
record saying the whole the drug war
wasn't for morality of it we didn't care
about that
we wanted to crackdown on deviant
populations Oh God and now Donald Trump
saying well execute them kill them kill
them kill them for big free people
making free decisions as to what to do
with their body and selling products
providing a service in the marketplace
that other people want kill them yes
well that is just as crazy as talking
about killing the CEO of Budweiser that
sounds like a crazy insane wild
authoritarian tyrannical genocide 'el
idea cuz that's what it is and it'd be
the same for you know people who sell
drugs for people who sell marijuana I
mean get the [ __ ] out of here man Wow
executing drug dealers Exene a more
authoritarian take than that and by the
way it's not even true there's a well
there's no problem in other countries
well first of all even if it were true
that there's no problem in other
countries you know you just took away
everybody's freedom and you don't live
in a free society
that's like saying ok we could have a
total and utter police state where there
are people with you know where they're
police officers with assault weapons at
every single [ __ ] corner and they shut
down all bars in the country and you
know we have a total lockdown on the
police state in in a in a sci-fi type
future in a futuristic movie where it's
like there are no rights none whatsoever
so ok you could potentially you know
find a way to reduce crime like that but
is that is that a desirable situation is
that how we want to live so sacrifice
all of your freedom all of your
enjoyment all of your pleasure for this
perceived idea of increased safety why
not put everybody in a [ __ ]
straitjacket and put them in a padded
room and say see you're happy here
there's no crime that exists in that
[ __ ] little padded room that you're
in so even if it were true that these
other countries don't have a problem
because they execute people even if it
were true it's a dumb idea but it's not
even true in fact you want to know how
one country that's done fantastic with
with this issue this issue of drugs
Portugal how has that happened Kyle they
decriminalized all drugs they
decriminalized all drugs they had a drug
scourge an epidemic there now they're
one of the better countries and they
don't have nearly as big of a problem
because they decriminalized all drugs
they stopped locking people up and being
punitive when it came to drugs and they
started treating it like a medical issue
oh you're addicted ok we're gonna have
treatment for you you know we're gonna
we're gonna treat you like a human being
not lock you in a cage or kill you as a
result of you know this issue that you
have man he is so bad
holy [ __ ]
holy [ __ ] he's like he really is the
foxnews president that's what he is
you know your [ __ ] uncle at the
Thanksgiving dinner table who's never
seen a conservative argument he didn't
instantly fall in love with your Rush
Limbaugh and Sean Hannity fan uncle that
that's not Donald Trump is that guy like
that's who he is and it's really sad
like he's not he doesn't know how to
think definitely has a low IQ and he's
just oh his arguments are so flippant
and so like there's what I think there
let me talk maybe kill him just kill him
[ __ ] kill him god damn it man holy
[ __ ]
I can't that's this is so immoral and so
unethical and so ridiculous and totally
indefensible and if you're somebody who
looks at this and you agree with him or
you think it's not as bad as you're
saying Kyle [ __ ] you
cuz you're wrong and on some level you
have to know that you're wrong how many
lives have been ruined already because
of the drug war and he wants to make it
worse he wants to potentially kill
people for selling drugs even though I
just spoke for over ten minutes I think
I met a I'm at a loss for words
I hope you're getting ready for the next
giant economic crash because I guarantee
you that it's coming so take a look at
this this is from the Washington Post
ten years after financial crisis Senate
prepares to roll back banking rules
isn't that lovely and you know who's
doing it
look at this next headline Republicans
are about to deregulate banks with
Democratic support 12 Senate Democrats
are backing a Republican bill to weaken
parts of dodd-frank so there's this
thing that I say and I say it pretty
often and I say it because it's true and
the point is bipartisanship as a general
rule is actually terrible it's actually
bad because the overwhelming majority of
the time when Democrats and Republicans
in Washington DC are agreeing they're
agreeing to screw you they're agreeing
to do the bidding of their donors so
that's why you should scoff when all the
centrist and establishment outlets start
begging for more bipartisanship because
they never go into the specifics they
never go into the details there's just
this underlying assumption that centrism
and bipartisanship is good by definition
but again they won't describe to you how
when there is agreement in Washington
between Democrats and Republicans it's
typically to screw you and to help their
rich buddies so let me give you the
breakdown of this here Senate Banking
Committee Chair Mike Crapo who has a
very appropriate last name he's a
Republican from Indiana and he's
sponsoring the bill it's called the
economic growth regulatory relief and
consumer protection act of course you
have to name a bill in an Orwellian way
that's like a rule in Washington DC
that's how we got the Patriot Act for
example the Patriot Act and by Patriot
we mean take away all of your
constitutional rights and forget due
process in habeas corpus and spy on you
endlessly patriotic as patreon
you do those things so you could see how
Orwell's at work here - the economic
growth regulatory relief and consumer
protection at consumer protection my ass
cheeks so here's what's in the bill
under current law banks with assets of
fifty billion dollars or more are
subject to stricter oversight from the
Federal Reserve and you know the reason
for that is simple Wow
it wasn't that long ago was in 2008 when
there was really really really lacks
regulation and as a result of that the
people at the banks were not the
smartest guys in the room they were the
greediest guys in the room and they made
terrible decisions that bankrupted
themselves and also brought down the
world economy so how about we have some
regulatory oversight for every bank that
is 50 billion dollars or above because
if you don't have referees there to make
sure that things aren't going crazy
things are gonna go crazy well guess
what in this bill they that raises the
threshold of banks that get strict
regulatory oversight to two hundred and
fifty billion dollars now they make the
hilarious argument that you don't
understand they're just doing this
because they want to help small
community financial institutions that's
why you have to raise the threshold for
oversight from 50 billion to two hundred
and fifty billion yeah there's so many
you know mom-and-pop 150 billion dollar
financial institutions out there at face
value this [ __ ] is ridiculous by the way
you know who was getting stronger
oversight and now it's gonna be lacks
that little that small business known as
American Express that's just one example
so they're lying to you they're lying
right to your face now the bill affects
about two dozen banks in total there's
another provision that allows foreign
mega banks such as dodge bank and HSBC
to put their American
assets into a separate holding company
to avoid US regulatory scrutiny so again
here we go they say it's to help small
banks but they raise the threshold from
50 billion to 250 billion so obviously
it's very big bags that are affected by
this and then on the other hand they
take foreign mega banks Deutsche Bank
HSBC and there's a loophole where they
can put their American assets into a
separate company to avoid up being
regulated this is right back to the
[ __ ] tricks that led to the crash in
the first place the bill allows lenders
with ten billion dollars and under to
expand the types of mortgages that they
offer so you know we can go for example
back to adjustable rate mortgages you
know again those things that were a
giant problem where they would say oh
we're gonna give you a low interest rate
now but in five or six years you're
gonna get slapped with you know a
gigantic spike in that interest rates
and hey you'll deal with it at the time
we'll cross that bridge when we come to
it
but then when everybody's rate went up
every bubble burst and nobody could pay
for it and there was a giant [ __ ]
crash and now they're going right back
to that it also eases appraisal
requirements on loans and exempt small
banks from disclosure rules so the bill
exempts small banks from the Volcker
Rule and again small they're talking
about here under two hundred fifty
billion and the Volcker Rule for those
of you who don't know that prohibits
speculative investments so like casino
capitalist risky bets from happening
with your money depositor money can't be
used for risky investments but now
they're scrapping that for small banks
and also it weakens leverage rules over
leveraging was again one of the main
problems that led to the original crash
to begin with this is unbelievably you
know crazy and it's almost comical like
the degree to which Wall Street has
captured our government is almost a
parody because it wasn't again it was
ten years ago wasn't that long ago that
we had a giant crash and they're going
right back
to the same things and then there they
brag about it because it's like hey we
agreed in a bipartisan fashion to do
something stupid but at least it's
bipartisan and a lot of the articles are
framed that way they're frame like well
looks like they're really getting
something done in Congress kappa is it
good or bad they don't tell you that
part so I want to give you the Democrats
who were for it this is absolutely
maddening you have Senator Joe Donnelly
from Indiana these are the Democrats the
Republicans there they're a lost cause
everybody knows they're a lost cause
they're hopeless the Republicans in DC I
mean they are nothing but a an arm of
Wall Street in corporate America but the
Democrats specifically the Blue Dogs and
the corporate Democrats they're just as
bad Joe Donnelly of Indiana a Heidi
Heitkamp of North Dakota Jon Tester of
Montana Mark Warner Claire McCaskill Joe
Manchin Joe man should Paula Jean
Swearengen you better go vote for if
you're in West Virginia in the primary
Tim Kaine remember when Hillary Clinton
and all the Democrats were trying to
pretend like no Tim Kaine has actually
really progressive we're not full of
[ __ ] yes you are he supported [ __ ]
TPP and now he's supporting Wall Street
deregulation what a joke this is and you
wonder why Donald Trump won well maybe
if Hillary Clinton didn't repeatedly and
routinely stab her bass in the back
maybe she would have been able to hang
on and win Gary Peters Michael Bennett
Chris Coons Thomas Carper and Doug Jones
remember Doug Jones
oh yay Doug Jones he won this is gonna
be great
the people the people who put Doug Jones
over the top poor people people of color
women and so people who are more
vulnerable those are the people who in
Alabama put Doug Jones over the top he
gets in there one of the first things he
does is deregulates the banks it's gonna
speed up the next crash which is going
to disproportionately hurt who the poor
in the most Boulder
in society I mean this is again it's
like a sick joke and what on earth makes
these Democrats think well you know in
order to be moderate in order to be
reasonable what we have to do is we have
to agree with the Republicans on core
issues no that's that's the [ __ ]
philosophy of democratic strategists who
repeatedly lose they keep losing
elections and now you still think
they're geniuses and they're right when
they say well rural voters in Indiana
and moderates want Wall Street to crash
the economy again so you got to do what
they want you to do who the [ __ ] that
voted for Doug Jones was seeing it
sitting at home going yes what are we
gonna give a Deutsche Bank another break
we need to give HSBC a hand up in this
crazy economy by the way they go on to
explain how the banks that they're
deregulated fifty billion to two hundred
fifty billion it's they're not they're
not struggling because they have this
[ __ ] argument of like oh it's
burdensome regulations and they can't
function in this situation
well no they're actually those banks are
doing fine right now
you know who's struggling working people
thanks you're doing fine but they take
the bank's who are already doing really
well and they go well since things are
going okay for them let's make life even
easier for them and deregulate them even
more it's not true that the way to win
elections and the way to win moderate
voters is to be corrupt because that's
what this is this is hey we're gonna be
corrupt and serve our big donors it's
not true that that's what you need to do
in order to win elections in fact it's
the opposite you have to super serve
your base if you're a Democrat if you
want to get reelected now who the [ __ ]
who voted for doug jones is gonna run to
the polls in the next election when he's
up for re-election all the people who
just voted for him he stabbed her in the
back but in his mind oh it's okay
because i'll pick up these phantom
center-right moderate republicans that's
not gonna happen
the republicans are going to vote for
you under no circumstances and you just
stabbed the people in the back who would
have voted for you your base so now it's
a guarantee that joke doug jones is
going to be out
in the next election cycle and when he
acts like this he [ __ ] deserves it
because you immediately stabbed in the
back the people who put you there now
it's not just that idiot Democrats think
this is a smart strategy obviously we
need to act like Republicans in order to
get Democrats to vote for us what that's
really what they believe that's really
what they believe that's really what
they believe but that's not all they
believe because there's another reason
why they did this take a look the
Financial Times pointed out that banks
that stand to benefit from the
legislation namely those with assets
within sight of the fifty billion dollar
range appear to have increased donations
to Senate Democrats who support the bill
individuals connected to signature Bank
a regional bank have donated one hundred
and twelve thousand dollars to senators
so far in the 2017-2018 election cycle
eight times as much as it did during the
entire 2015-2016 election cycle
senators Heitkamp and Donnelly two of
the bills co-sponsors have been the
biggest recipients of the signature link
Democratic donations ian Katz an analyst
at the Washington research firm capital
alpha partners told me it's possible the
Crapo bill could introduce some risk as
certain banks will now get less
supervision but this scenario won't be
dire quote it doesn't look to me it
doesn't look to me like it introduces
new significant risk into the system he
said that's [ __ ] adorable so an
analyst at the Washington research firm
capital alpha partners so in other words
somebody who's in bed with these same
[ __ ] is like this won't cause
systemic risks oh my god they're
fleecing all of us the government is so
beholden to big money and corporate
donors that like I said at the beginning
is it's like it's like a parody it's
like comical you know I mean this is so
brazen so blatant so overt it's almost
like they're rubbing it in your face how
corrupt they are we just had a subprime
mortgage crisis in a Great Recession by
the way there wasn't there
no recovery for regular people the
recovery all went to the rich and think
about what happened in the wake of that
recession Barack Obama stepped in he
didn't say I'm gonna bailout the people
he didn't do that he said oh we're gonna
bail out Wall Street so the same people
who just crashed the economy and
bankrupted their own companies you run
in there with a blank check of taxpayer
money and then they turn around and pay
bonuses to the people who made the
decisions that crashed the economy and
bankrupted their companies so this is a
game it's a game and there's no
consequences for them they [ __ ] up in
the first place
they got a bonus anyway now they're
right back to [ __ ] up and now they
got rid of the few rules that were in
place that tried to make sure this
doesn't happen again and then when
there's another crash the idiots on CNBC
and Fox Business are gonna be like oh
who could have seen this coming this is
so shocking I see it coming anybody with
a functioning brain who's not corrupt
sees it coming it's unbelievable and at
the same time this [ __ ] is going on they
pass a tax bill where 83% of the
benefits of the tax bill go to the top
one percent the bill raises taxes over a
10-year period on everybody making
$75,000 a year or less it raises it
excuse me cuts corporate taxes from
thirty five percent to twenty one
percent at a time when corporations are
already paying a historically low
percentage of the tax burden
corporations used to pay 33 percent of
the federal tax burden now they pay
about nine percent it's gonna be less
that burden is shifted on to you all the
while you get rid of the referees for
the richest people who rigged the
economy in the first place speeding up
the next crash and you're gonna shoulder
the burden of the next crash as well
that's what's gonna happen and half of
workers in America make thirty thousand
dollars a year or less about thirty
million people don't have health care
this is the country that we're living in
and the party that's supposed to be the
party of the workers a dozen of them
just stand
you in the back for some ridiculous
electoral notion of me stabbing the
voters in the back is somehow gonna help
me in the next election even though it's
not and also they did it for corrupt
reasons because they're taking donations
from these banks so there is no worker
party for the workers in America because
the one thing everybody seems to agree
on actually there's two things everybody
seems to agree on always do what Wall
Street wants and always push for more
war well we want people who are gonna
stand up against those things we want
people who are gonna fight Wall Street
on behalf of workers because those
interests are not aligned if you're on
the side of big banks and Wall Street
you are by definition against the
workers so we need somebody's gonna
fight Wall Street we need somebody who's
gonna fight the military-industrial
complex we're bombing eight different
countries right now talk to a random
dude in Kentucky you know he's just
trying to keep his [ __ ] lights on and
pay the water bill meanwhile we're
spending billions untold billions of
dollars overseas who in Niger is a
threat to that dude in Kentucky that
they're not there so stop wasting our
money that our infrastructure gets a
grade of D plus let's rebuild here at
home let's make our infrastructure get
an a-plus let's do a new New Deal and
put people to work but no your
government is too busy representing big
banks and lying to write your face oh
we're only doing this to help community
banks really what's your definition of a
community bank well we're gonna get rid
of the regulations for if they have two
hundred and forty nine billion dollars
that doesn't sound like a community bank
to me [ __ ] this is unconscionable man
the Democrats should be [ __ ] ashamed
of themselves and then listen you know
what another result of this is you're
rolling the dice in the next election it
would be a guaranteed blue wave if
Democrats ran on policy issues and were
serious about it imagine if every
democrat got on the same page and said
here's our agenda Medicare for
all free college living wage and the
Wars legalize marijuana
universal background checks on gun
purchases Democrats can run on any
individual issue and have a blue tsunami
the likes of which we've never seen but
they're not doing that they're talking
about [ __ ] stormy Daniels they're
talking about Russia non-stop and
they're deregulating the banks and so
now what you're doing is you're rolling
the dice in the next election
there still might be a blue wave but
that blue wave would be an accident it
would just be a Trump backlash and the
wave isn't gonna be worth much if you
get a bunch of Democrats elected and
then those Democrats keep agreeing to do
right-wing policies like deregulating
the bank's if that blue wave is not
really a blue wave it's a blue wave in
name but center-right politicians get
elected corporatist get elected then
what's the point of the blue wave in the
first place cuz you're gonna get right
way policies at the end of the day
anyway so they're rolling the dice here
for for the re-election because they
continue to stab
regular people in the back and do the
bidding of their donors so this is one
of the saddest things I've ever seen
we've learned nothing from history we
just had a crash because of these
policies and we're going right back to
these policies and as they implement
them they're bragging about it
we did something in a bipartisan way
sure the bipartisan bill is the stick a
broom up your mother's ass act but hey
at least it's bipartisan and bipartisan
means we're working together and working
together is by definition good so shut
up and cheer us as we do the bidding of
our donors no we're not going to do that
we're going to fight back against you
because both parties are wholly bought
known by the banks
so I'm about to show you a video clip of
Noam Chomsky and he's basically debating
some professors the professors seem to
be taking the position of moral
relativism and also post-modernism
so before I show you the video I just
want to give you some loose definitions
for that we go to the always trusty
Wikipedia I'm being pretty
tongue-in-cheek with that it's not
always trusty but sometimes it's it's
decent and I think this is one of those
instances so for moral relativism they
say moral relativism may be any of
several philosophical positions
concerned with the differences in moral
judgments across different people and
cultures descriptive moral relativism
holds that some people do in fact
disagree about what is moral meta
ethical moral relativism holds that in
such disagreements nobody is objectively
right or wrong and normative moral
relativism holds that because nobody is
right or wrong we ought to tolerate the
behavior of others even when we disagree
about the morality of it okay so let me
just break this down a little bit for
you
descriptive moral relativism is
something that is just a fact so in
other words descriptive moral relativism
means that there is a difference between
how people in liberal Hawaii and Saudi
Arabia view morality so the the feelings
of people generally speaking in Hawaii
versus Saudi Arabia they don't agree
much on what is moral what constitutes a
moral Society what the right way to act
in the world is I mean there's some
crossover of course as there is in any
human populations but there are a
variety of disagreements on women's
rights for example on gay rights and you
can go down the list so descriptive
moral relativism is really not
Hershel or even really open to debate
and Chomsky references that at one point
he says there's one version of moral
relativism which is totally
uncontroversial and it's descriptive
because that just describes the fact
that there are different cultures that
have different moral values so that
one's easy then you get to one that's a
little bit more graduated so meta
ethical moral relativism holds that in
such disagreements
nobody is objectively right or wrong
okay so that's a little different so
they're they're saying okay you can have
opinions and preferences as to which
kind of a society is better you could
say hey it's my personal feeling that
living in Hawaii is preferable to living
in Saudi Arabia but Metta ethical moral
relativism holds that you're admitting
that that view is subjective and there's
nothing objective about it so in other
words there's nothing factual from a
moral perspective about saying that
Hawaii or Denmark is more moral than
Saudi Arabia and then you get to
normative moral relativism which is the
most extreme version and here they say
normative moral relativism holds it
because nobody is right or wrong we
ought to tolerate the behavior of others
even when we disagree about the morality
of it so that one's the the most
controversial because that's basically
saying who are you to judge bro I mean
so what Isis may throw gay people off
roofs but they're just live in a
different way you can't say that not
throwing gays off roofs is superior to
throw in gays off roofs it's just a
different culture bro so normative moral
relativism is something that's you know
easy to mock and parody because it's a
very extreme version of moral relativism
where you basically are rendering all
judgments in incorrect you can make no
judgments about morality because you
have no grounds to do so now they go on
to say here in the Wikipedia page not
all descriptive
adopt a meta ethical relativism so the
first kind of relativists we spoke about
which we all are descriptive moral
relativist because that's a fact to be a
descriptive moral relativist they say
not all descriptive relativists adopt
meta ethical relativism and moreover not
all meta ethical relativists adopt
normative relativism so there's
different degrees here that's basically
what they're saying so the next thing
that they're gonna they bring it up they
touch on it in the videos you're about
to see the Chomsky videos you're about
to see but this also is definitely at
the heart of the conversation and the
debate that they're gonna have
post-modernism so many of you probably
know what post-modernism is but for
those of you who don't post modernism
describes a broad movement that
developed in the mid to late 20th
century across philosophy the arts
architecture and criticism and that
marked a departure from modernism the
term has long the term has also more
generally been applied to the historical
era that followed modernity and the
tendencies of this era while
encompassing a disparate variety of
approaches post-modernism is typically
defined by an attitude of skepticism
irony or rejection toward the meta
narratives and ideologies of modernism
if it doesn't make much sense yet hold
on because it's about to make sense for
you and often calls into question
various assumptions of enlightenment
rationality common objects of postmodern
critique include Universalist notions of
objective more of objective reality
morality truth
human nature reason language and social
progress post modern thinkers frequently
call to attention but frequently call
hold on I lost my place post modern
thinkers frequently call attention to
the contextual or socially conditioned
nature of knowledge claims and value
systems situating them as products of
particular political historical or
cultural discourses and hierarchies
accordingly post
modern thought is broadly characterized
by tendencies to self referentiality
epistemological and moral relativism
pluralism subjectivism and irreverence
okay so basically the heart of what you
need to know about post-modernism is
this snippet right here common objects
of postmodern critiques include
Universalist notions of objective
reality morality truth
human nature reason language and social
progress that's the heart of it so
they're not fans of you know a universal
notion of morality they don't think
there's an objective morality they don't
think there's an objective reality they
don't think there's an objective truth
or human nature they want you to be
skeptical of the Enlightenment you want
you to be skeptical of social progress
and post modern thinkers oftentimes they
they think much of what's around us is a
social construction so in other words
human nature doesn't play as big of a
role in creating societies a lot of it
is basically arbitrary they would say
and chosen and molded over time this is
the gist of the post modernist movement
so now that we have a basic
understanding of what moral relativism
is and post-modernism is let's watch
Noam Chomsky debate moral relativism and
post-modernism and then we'll come back
and I'll give you my take and I'll also
give you my history of what I thought of
these issues and then what I currently
think of these issues forty years ago
you had the telly televised debate on
the Dutch TV with Michel Foucault
probably the most influential
contemporary French intellectual you
said that you had never met anybody so a
moral and indeed is widely viewed as the
main defender of us
modernism and mobile relativism but what
is wrong with that don't you see that
ethical norms vary widely across space
and time sleeping subjugation of women
repression of homosexuals have been
accepted in many cultures and still are
here it is a scandal to make caricatures
of the Holocaust but it is considered
admirable to make caricatures of the
Prophet in Han it's the other way around
the terrorists of the Israelis are the
freedom fighters of the Palestinians
Muslims think that their religion is
truly universal and Christian things
likewise but for their religion while
secular easting secularism is the only
solution isn't truth itself including
scientific truth always the effect of
regimes of truth as Foucault call them
that are inextricably linked to power
isn't there something both parochial and
imperialist in asserting one's own value
system as being good truly Universal and
good if there are truly objective and
universal moral norms how do you
discover and justify them moral
relativism it's a it's a little
difficult to discuss it's a little bit
like discussing skepticism there there
are no skeptics you can discuss it in a
philosophy seminar but no human being
can in fact be a skeptic they wouldn't
survive for two minutes if they were so
they're not and I think pretty much the
same is true of moral relativism there
are no moral relativists there are
people who profess it you can discuss it
abstractly but it it doesn't exist in
ordinary life and to sharpen the
discussion a little should recognize
that the concept moral relativism ranges
over quite a broad spectrum so there's a
form of moral relativism which is
totally uncontroversial of course it's
true there are as quote this there are
ethical norms that vary widely over
space and time and that's a stat
observation of fact nobody denies that
a similarly every other aspect of humans
varies quite widely so for example human
visual systems that can vary quite
widely in the way they function
depending on early experience that it's
been shown by experiment enough with
humans but with other animals with
essentially the same visual system that
you can change you can change them
radically just by early experience every
biological system and I assume we're
biological organism so our moral values
and ethical systems are also biological
systems every one of them can vary quite
widely depending on experience that's
not controversial so for example the
human visual system can be varied
experimentally so that it will have
distant different distributions of
receptors that respond to horizontal and
vertical lines and that will give a very
different perception you can show it
with cats and monkeys we have the same
visual system on the other hand you
can't turn a human visual system into a
an insect visual system as you change
experience and this is quite general
across the biological domain including
moral systems there are there's a range
of options that's possible there's
variation within that range but there
are also limits to the range and in fact
this takes us to the there's a tendency
to move from the uncontroversial concept
of moral relativism to a concept that is
in fact incoherent and that's to say
that moral values can range indefinitely
that belief which is held is literally
incoherent it's based on the assumption
that moral values reflect culture but
then that raises the next question how
does a person acquire how does a person
acquire it's that his or her culture I
mean you don't get it by taking a pill
you'd get your culture you acquire your
culture by observing rather limited a
number of behaviors and actions and from
those constructing somehow in your mind
the set of attitudes and beliefs that
constitute your culture but that act is
very much like learning a language or
like developing a visual system or in
fact like finding a scientific theory
it's a matter of making a great leap
from scattered data to some outcome and
that leap is made essentially the same
way by all individuals given relatively
fixed experience and it's only possible
if you have extensive built in innate
structure just as you can develop a
human rather than an insect visual
system only if it's guided by genetic
instructions very specific ones the same
is true of acquisition of language of
acquisition of arithmetic or capacity
acquisition of a culture hence
acquisition of moral values but that
means that the most extreme form of
moral relativism is actually committed
to the belief in universal values namely
those that set the frame in which this
tremendous leap from data scattered data
to a complex relatively fixed system can
take place that's why the extreme
version of moral relativism which is
common and I think Foucault professed it
is simply incoherent if you adopt that
position you are committed to
far-reaching universal values and their
existence those that just as if you are
studying the visual system and you
discover that it can vary over a wide
range you're nevertheless in fact by
that very fact that committed to the
belief that there are fixed innate
genetically determined constraints that
set the framework in which it can too
and that sort of guide the development
of the structure even though allowing a
certain degree of variation and in fact
I think that the I won't talk about
post-modernism that's beyond my capacity
to discuss but just keep the
post-modernism which at least has the
merit of being incoherent I'm not sure
that post-modernism even reaches that
far but it reminds me of a famous
comment of a physicist Wolfgang Pauli
who was apparently pretty acid person
and used to say sometimes when someone
proposed something that's not even false
you didn't get that far but the take
these examples a slavery subjugation of
women repression of homosexuals and
let's forget about a variety of cultures
just think about our own in our own
culture not that far back these were all
perfectly accepted dorms so it takes a
repression of homosexuals that one of
the greatest mathematicians of the 20th
century Alan Turing who also was a war
hero in Britain he's one of the people
who really saved Britain from the German
assault he was instrumental in
developing the techniques that did
decoded the German signal so the British
were able to determine where the Bombers
have been a hit and so on and so forth
he was a killed by the British
government by a forced treatment to cure
his disease of homosexuality well it
wasn't that long ago I mean that was
when I was a graduate student you know
doesn't seem very long ago to me that's
inconceivable now totally inconceivable
moral values have advanced I would say
that what it means is that we have
penetrated more deeply into our own
actual moral values and seen as the
moral sphere
extends that some things that were
considered completely normal and
admirable are so atrocious you can't
even think about them and the same is
true of slavery subjugation of women is
very recently overcome one way to go yet
but changed dramatically in the last
3040 years as I mentioned beginning just
with consciousness-raising groups that
brought women to recognize that what
they took to be normal and necessary and
even unacceptable is in fact completely
that should be totally rejected
ok that's same thing widening of the
morals you're the same mister of slavery
a little bit earlier they're still our
slaves estimated thirty million or so in
the world but it's regarded as
reprehensible and totally unacceptable
and in fact if you look at the history
of overcoming of slavery in the West it
was substantially moral arguments
incidentally it's not that the slave
owners had no arguments they did and
it's worth attending to those arguments
in fact some of them really have never
been answered and the fact that they're
not answered gives us some insight it's
always in fact in general contrary to
the views of the extreme moral relevance
relativists moral disagreements can be
debated you don't just have to scream at
each other you can look at the arguments
try to find some common ground that work
from the common ground and try to reach
a conclusion that's the moral
interchange and it's often successful so
thanks
slavery one of the arguments during the
American Civil War of the slave owners
which is a serious argument is that they
argued that they are more moral than
northern industrialists and for a very
simple reason they own their workers and
therefore they take care of them that
just as if you own a car you'll take
care of it northern industrialists rent
their workers
and they don't take care of them they
have no responsibility for them just as
if you rent a car you probably won't
take care of it so therefore slavery is
more moral than than a capitalist
industrial policy actually I think
there's some merit to that argument but
instead of concluding from it that save
slavery is legitimate that we should
conclude what working people in the
north in the century and a half ago we
should draw their conclusion was a very
common belief among working people in
the United States that wage labor is
fundamentally no different from slavery
the only difference is its temporary in
fact that was such a popular view that
it was a slogan of the Republican Party
it was Abraham Lincoln's view you could
read it in the New York Times it's taken
a long time to drive that understanding
out of people's heads and I don't think
it's driven very far
I think it's right below the surface and
it continually comes out instantly just
to comment on this idea about regimes of
truth I suspect we're going to agree
about this but I mean I think Fugo Fuko
wildly exaggerated again there's a kind
of a truism which is not controversial
that power systems have some effect on
the way the scientific work proceeds and
can be accepted and so on sometimes it's
at the extreme it's a Stalinist biology
ok that had an effect
there's corporate influences on how drug
trials are conducted that's true there
are professional restric
constraints actually I've lived through
them in my entire life when I started my
own professional work I couldn't publish
because it was too inconsistent with
accept that ideas in fact the first book
I wrote in 1955 it didn't come out for
20 years and it came out then it was
submitted that rejected it came in out
later just
as kind of like for historical interest
but then filled and developed it grown
so sure that happens but its marginal
and there are self-correcting procedures
in the sciences which work pretty well
not perfectly but pretty well so there
is an element of you know power
relations that enter into say scientific
work but to talk about regimes of power
it seems to me
radically overstating the case the real
question is whether you can regard these
differences within a framework of
progress in the sense that some cultures
are features of culture are better than
others I mean the real question of
cultural relativism is is one whether
you think progress implies as you said
an underlined an underlying innate sense
for instance a sense of justice or
whether these cultural choices are
wholly arbitrary with none being better
than it but I mean that's the real issue
it was cultural relativism but whatever
you believe about that there is a fixed
basis there must be a fixed basis
otherwise you can't acquire our culture
in the first place and that fixed basis
has to be determinative narrowly
determinative now that fixed basis gives
our our actual human called moral values
now if you take a look if you raise the
question about progress you know I think
we are live we are live [ __ ]
welcome to the kyle is technologically
inept our this happens literally every
time we we do one of these I kind of
fumble my way through it but it's still
fun either way so let's see let me
refresh this okay that didn't work
of course what I'm trying to do is get
into the back end of this YouTube
livestream I'll start talking about
stuff in a minute don't worry about that
there we go live control room
boom Shakalaka beach okay here we are so
I'm gonna I'll take some super chats in
a little bit but first let me run
through some stuff that I wanted to talk
about um I see everybody's everybody's
jumping in the chat what's up everybody
holler for a dollar okay so this is this
is the pre Rogan livestream so um I'll
be on Joe Rogan Tuesday at 11 a.m.
Pacific time when I'm done here I'm
gonna I'll be hoppin on a flight
everybody knows how [ __ ] terrified I
am a flying so even though I don't
believe in prayer please say some
prayers for me I hate flying man I hate
it with such a burning passion it's
ridiculous I can't even put into words
how much I hate it
so I was talking to somebody about this
and they were like look it's just it's
all in your head so just you know you
could override it yeah that's kind of
true but at the same time it's not just
the thoughts that get me it's also the
literal feeling you get when you're
flying you're in like a pressurized
cabin and you're you know thousands of
feet in the air going 500 miles an hour
and you're in a little metal tube and I
think I'm like way too much of a control
freak
and since I'm a control freak I want to
always I'm a perfectionist and I always
want to be able to like micromanage [ __ ]
and if I'm in a position where I can't
like I'm forced to sit in the same place
and in the case of a flight to
California for six [ __ ] hours and
like there are no options it's just like
yeah here's it's almost like being in
prison it's like here's where you are
and you're not allowed to move really
you're not allowed to like be free or
get some fresh air like you're just
confined to this area and there's
something about that I [ __ ] hate and
just that like the motion sickness I
told the story before but when I was a
kid my dad had a boat and we used to go
on it and go fishing and stuff and then
and I never had a problem with you know
seasickness or anything but the last
time I went on a boat maybe three years
ago I immediately felt sick the second I
put my foot on the boat and just had a
little bit of the movement of the water
there I was like this is terrible is the
worst thing ever I feel like I'm gonna
die and I should have been smart and
said you know what I'm not I'm done here
I'm not going fishing with you guys and
taking a step off the boat and said okay
it is what it is but I didn't know I was
like suck it up be a man go out there
and it was like literally four or five
hours of sheer torture the entire time I
felt beyond sick I don't know the word
for it it was just like all my brain
wanted was to be steady in the same
position and all that was happening was
non-stop and so it was I can't even put
into words how sick I felt it was the
worst [ __ ] thing ever but what's
crazy is literally the second we got off
the boat I felt better
isn't that crazy it was the second I got
off the boat I was like oh that's it I'm
better I'm now on flat ground and I feel
good again so anyway isn't it funny that
I'm so strange that I'm more fearful of
just the plane ride than I am about
doing a podcast where I'm gonna there's
gonna be over a million people who
listen because that's what it is like I
bet I don't that's like afterthought
it's like whatever
looking talking in front of people's
nothing but the the idea of just being
on a plane is like it triggers something
inside that it's just it's not good so
anyway now that I've explained to you
guys how much of a little [ __ ] I am
there are some things I wanted to
discuss again I'll get to super chats in
a little bit but first let me go through
some stuff there's not gonna be a show
this week so I wanted to maybe you know
do some stuff now
and by the way Monday I'll be on I'll be
on The Young Turks for both hours and
then Tuesday is when I'm on Rogen like I
said but since I'm not gonna be here
might as well do some stories for you
guys alive here so one thing I wanted to
discuss is YouTube decided to punish
Infowars for promoting the Florida
School shooting conspiracy theory now
when we talk about Infowars I I have
less than no love for Infowars I think
there was a time when Alex Jones was
like half right about stuff and half
dead wrong and what I mean is he was one
of the first people to talk about like
NSA spying and oh my god they're
collecting all of your information and
he seemed like he was pretty civil
libertarian ish he also was at one time
strongly against the Iraq war so those
are the things where I could agree with
the guy but he always just put a heaping
dose of conspiracy theory in with it
stuff that nobody should accept at face
value and also there's a deeper problem
with conspiracy theories which is if you
get too obsessed with the conspiracy
theory then you totally forget about the
policy outcome and what you really
should be fighting for so like you're
sucking all of the air out of a movement
for example to end the war if your main
focus is you know 9/11 truther ism is
correct and we need the government to
admit that it's like okay so Eve let's
say in some bizarro world 9/11 truther
ISM is correct what if the government
amidst that then what like
there is no and then like so it's almost
like conspiracy theories love to smell
their own farts and jerk each other off
and act like we have a truth that nobody
else has and let's just keep talking
about that truth endlessly so Alex Jones
went from a guy who was like half right
about some policy stuff and then crazy
about a bunch of other stuff too now
he's just you know mister I love the
establishment I love Fox News and Tucker
Carlson and Rush Limbaugh and I'm
Trump's biggest [ __ ] defender and
then you mix in being just a standard
right-wing Republican douche bag right
along with insane conspiracy theories
like now he tries to pretend like he
never said Sandy Hook was a hoax [ __ ]
we know you said it was a hoax it's on
video so if you're promoting that kind
of garbage you're just wrong like
there's no other way to describe you're
just incorrect about [ __ ] um so I have
no love for Alex Jones I mean when he
think about the arguments that they made
when they said hey Sandy Hook is a hoax
the argument was well Obama's gonna come
and take your guns and this is how
they're gonna do it well guess what Alex
Obama didn't come and take the guns so
your whole motive is wrong like your
whole motive blew up the first thing
they when there's a crime the first
question is what's the motive for the
crime
if you can't establish motive then
you're wrong so this is one of those
instances where you said Obama was gonna
take the guns they didn't take the guns
in fact the Democrats obviously never
even proposed taking guns the furthest
they went was an assault weapons ban
which is just tweaks around the edges so
he's just wrong about [ __ ] now having
said all that do I agree with YouTube's
punishing Infowars no again this is what
people don't understand is if you don't
defend the free speech and the free
expression of people you absolutely
despise then you don't actually believe
in freedom of speech and freedom of
expression now of course there are some
rules you know like you can't do direct
threats of violence for example okay
that's a clear rule everybody agrees
with that you can't Doc's people okay
that's a clear rule everybody agrees
with that you can't do libel or slander
fair enough but
number one those things are notoriously
hard to prove and number two everything
else is open season you could say
whatever you want to say so Alex Jones
has always been promoting backwards
kooky ass theories and now is when
YouTube besides Oh will crack out on him
and the reason they're doing it is
because it's getting mainstream media
attention and the thing that's
frustrating is like they think like the
mainstream media thinks they're being
do-gooders by pointing out like huh look
at this okay I did you know YouTube
should do something about this when
people promote say crazy things but then
where do you draw the [ __ ] line man
this is the debate this is the argument
so if you say hey we're gonna pull down
some alex jones conspiracy stuff because
of you know they're they're lying about
one of the kids who went to this florida
school or they're smearing him and stuff
which is all true well then okay next is
i don't know by what standard you can
keep up the Sandy Hook conspiracies and
some of you might say okay yeah take
down those two okay but the next is the
9/11 truther conspiracies now by the way
I'm not by any stretch of the
imagination a 9/11 truther but it is
true that the official story is [ __ ]
like there's giant holes in the official
story so if you if you question that
narrative is that enough to get your
video pulled so you go from conspiracies
about the Florida shooting those gotta
go then you'd say Sandy Hook those got
to go then you say 9/11 truth and then
you get into JFK damage literally the
majority of the American people think
JFK was not assassinated just by Lee
Harvey Oswald they think something else
was going on whether it's the Mafia or
the CIA or Cuba or there's a million
theories out there but that's one that
to this day there's still a vibrant
debate going on and if you say okay
we're gonna pull down this Alex Jones
one because it's a conspiracy and it's
damaging and they said it violated the
boolean clause of their Terms of Service
I don't agree with that they weren't
bullying him they were just making a
[ __ ] theories well then where do you
draw the line and they will always
always always flip it back on the left
and that's the main point Abby Martin
made this point the other day and a good
she said listen I don't like on medium
for example is now pulling down all
right accounts and nobody despises the
alt-right more than me I think there are
a band of [ __ ] idiots but why the
[ __ ] I don't even understand if you
leave up there [ __ ] I think you're gonna
more people are gonna turn away from
them
so the original conspiracy video about
this shooting in Florida the dislikes
were like 70% or so so you know what
that means people watched it and the
overwhelming majority were like get
[ __ ] is this is [ __ ] so you gave
it a platform and people [ __ ] on it and
that's exactly the kind of free market
of ideas that you want so when they
start over policing and they pull down
the alt-right sites how long until they
start coming for the left and the answer
is they've already started coming for
the left we already know this this is ad
pocalypse was one example of that now
the D ranking crisis is the other
example of that how if you're if you're
already a subscriber of site of secular
talk you'll see my videos in the
recommended section but now YouTube is
tampering down so that I can't attract
as many new people and this is what
happens they've decided hey you're not
an authoritative news source so when you
start pulling down conspiracy theories
over here well then you're also gonna
start pulling down truth from the left
over here so when I start saying hey you
do know that the u.s. armed jihadists in
Syria when I start talking about that
some people might hear that and go
that's a conspiracy now they're wrong
because I know what the evidence is I
know what all the articles say and I
know the reality of the situation but
that sounds like a conspiracy doesn't it
oh the US is funding jihadist bi okay
the [ __ ] hippie dippie far-left
[ __ ] it's just it's a proven fact
but do we trust the establishment and
YouTube to be objective about that and
fair about that
so no they're gonna start coming for
people who talk about the DNC email
leaks and they're gonna say you're
useful idiots of Russia and this needs
to be pulled down and that needs to be
pulled down and then we're [ __ ] so you
have to draw a clean line that says you
allow it all allow it all the only
things you can't do or direct threats of
violence and daxing people and [ __ ] like
that but you just you have to take a
principled stand for free speech
and I know some people's response to
this is Kyle it's YouTube their private
company they could do what they want to
which I respond you're absolutely right
they can do whatever the [ __ ] they want
I'm not making a legal argument I'm
making an argument from principle I'm
saying if you want to abide by the
principle of free speech then they would
act in a way where they say okay
free platform you say whatever you want
here are the very few rules and that's
it
so it's just I think it's a shame that
you know they're doing that and then
also you make Alex Jones a martyr now
that's what just happened you made Alex
Jones a martyr and by the way sorry if I
peak off to the side here Tiger Woods is
in contention at a golf tournament and
that makes me the happiest person ever
you made Alex Jones a martyr so now he
gets to go out there and say oh they're
oppressing me because they hate the
truth and they don't want you to learn
the truth so infowars.com and go you
know join and talk about how wonderful I
am and how I'm so oppressed by the
powers that be when in reality Alex yes
you are being tampered down by them and
they're wrong for doing that but you're
also an idiot so you know that nuance
gets lost on people if you start making
Alex a victim so that's that's my two
cents on that let me dip in real quick
to what's going on here okay let me let
me go through some of the other stuff I
wanted to discuss so remember the Donald
Trump carrier situation from a while
back Donald Trump ran as a populist
candidate who said listen I'm gonna keep
your jobs in this country Hillary's
terrible Bill Clinton was terrible they
did NAFTA and they outsourced to all
these jobs and we are gonna make it so
these corporations keep jobs here
well carrier was the first example that
it was a brilliant marketing move
because Trump went literally went to a
plant that was they were gonna have
their jobs outsourced and said I am
saving your jobs and at the time
everybody gave him credit including me
because it looked like oh [ __ ] look at
that he actually held true and he's
keeping the jobs here and
No you started thinking like well why
the [ __ ] couldn't Obama have done
something like this or if Hillary were
to get elected nobody could conceive of
her going to a [ __ ] plant with but
you know blue-collar workers around and
just and talking to them like yes we're
gonna keep your jobs here and let's make
a big thing about this because this is
what it should be like in America well
turns out it was all [ __ ] because a
few months after they did this whole dog
and pony show and this Kabuki theater
headline started coming out about how
they just laid off fifty people now it's
a hundred people now it's 200 people now
it's 300 people now it's actually even
worse than that because they kept laying
off they laid off hundreds of people
anyway while at the same time carrier is
getting a giant corporate welfare check
from the taxpayers so it's the worst of
both worlds
before they were just gonna outsource
the jobs now they're outsourcing the
jobs and they're hosing down the
taxpayers so it's even worse than what
we possibly could have [ __ ] imagined
well guess what now we learned it's even
worse than what I just described it's
worse than what was already worse it
turns out that they struck a deal
carrier struck a deal back they get a
two point five billion dollar Pentagon
contract so the hill was reporting on
this and they basically say I'm gonna
scroll down here cuz the parent company
of carrier the people who really got the
deal I want to make sure I get their
name right I think it's United
Technologies a manufacturing giant that
struck a deal with President Trump to
keep hundreds of jobs in the United
States was recently awarded two point
five billion dollar Department of
Defense contract with no competition no
bid contract this is what was discussed
behind closed doors before they did the
Kabuki theater guys this is how politics
works Trump said I'll give you whatever
the [ __ ] you want if you just keep these
jobs here for a few months and that's
what happened so United Technologies is
the company they're the parent company
of carrier they say the company the
company received millions of dollars in
tax breaks over ten years to keep the
jobs in the US Greg Hayes CEO of United
Technologies have the time they were
convinced to stay in India
after discussions with Trump and
vice-president pence but days after the
deal was reached they said an interview
that part of the company 16 million
dollar investment in the facility would
go towards investment in automation so
last July the plant laid off 300 workers
at the Indianapolis facility and in
November the company announced it would
lay off more than 200 additional
employees see this is what it is man
you're getting [ __ ] working-class
people are always getting [ __ ] and
then guys like Trump come come around
and he runs as a fake populist and he
doesn't [ __ ] deliver Obama was
similar on this front to he did a lot of
fake populism [ __ ] he spoke against
NAFTA and then he signed some free trade
agreements when he was elected under
Obama there were 87 thousand jobs that
were offshored in his in his final year
in office eighty-seven thousand jobs now
Trump is actually even worse
ninety-three thousand jobs were
outsourced in his first year as
president so you basically have two
wings of the corporate party we don't
have two political parties in this
country we have two wings of the
corporate party so it's a [ __ ] shame
and the Democrats have such an
opportunity here they could take over in
a blue tsunami come the next election if
they actually cared about populist
candidates and uncorrupted candidates
but the reality is they're actually
fighting back against the populist and
uncorrupted candidates who are running
we've discussed the stories about how
they're they're basically swinging an
axe at the face of various justice
Democrats who are not taking any
corporate PAC money and who are for
Medicare for all in a living wage so it
it's tough to watch this unfold because
we're hurling towards the abyss and the
establishment of both parties is
facilitating that and in fact putting it
in hyperdrive so by the way you guys can
start sending in those super chats now
I'll just there's just a few more things
I want to talk about so Donald Trump
said violence in video games might be
responsible for the mass shootings
hmm testing testing 1 2 3 dust it's
working we could do this go it's so
professional we're so professional hello
everybody
what are we live Dober live man oh we
live not live but we're on I tweeted out
right before we were about to come on
corn
give me poll questions okay good I ask
people for poll questions how many good
ones we're gonna find out right now I
don't know there's 83 responses so
hopefully there'll be some polls in
there I feel like a like a cigarette
smoker man who's like really been going
strong and not having a cigarette with
Twitter I'm like oh [ __ ] yeah I've been
on a big break the last time I checked
was I think when my daughter was born I
might have checked there's some [ __ ] cuz
I was just sitting in the hospital so
that's like it's the last time you
checked yeah okay so hold on I think
you're on to something here because I
know there are times I have flashes of
it where I'm like oh [ __ ] I'm kind of
addicted to Twitter like I have flashes
of it where I'm like but that's your job
it's not mine it's not like but it like
it's a little bit of a problem like I
will be doing some [ __ ] and I'll be like
okay I'm done with Twitter for the night
and I'll X out Twitter and then not even
two minutes later I'll open a new tab
and go to Twitter yeah I'm like I don't
I can't why did I do that like I just
said I don't want to do this anymore and
then I went right back to it yeah it's
like that's something that's like that's
like an issue that's when you go woah
woah woah woah woah woah
maybe it's time to like unplug here for
a little bit because it's almost like
it's like a reflex in a way I don't even
think about it just like what Twitter it
just happens
it's just like I was doing that when I
woke up dude like it was like I woke up
and instantaneously was like grab my
phone
check ur Twitter Instagram and Facebook
I deleted a while ago but I posted for
when my daughter was born but like I
came to the conclusion like I guess I
mean if you have a following and like
people like like what you're saying and
like there's a purpose behind your [ __ ]
then yes Twitter by all means but like I
was walking to work and I saw like a
sale sign on a window and the [ __ ] was
painted on there so I tweeted like if
the sale sign is painted on your window
[ __ ] is
definitely not on sale and I was like I
think that's funny but then later on I
was like who gives a [ __ ] like what the
[ __ ] like who cares that I wrote that
like who like who cares I laughed at it
what I saw no no it's you know what cuz
when you get positive feedback it's like
oh this is fun like this is good what I
have made rules for myself with my
Twitter usage I don't really read my
mentions ever if I ever come across my
mention that's by accident
smart because I know what it's like to
go through the motions you could go down
a [ __ ] rabbit hole well sure that's
the thing is like I'm the type of person
where I have this thing where I'm like I
have to correct this like I it's just
this thing I have where if I see
something that's not true I'm like oh I
I have to correct this I can't just
leave it like I have to and so somebody
will say something that's not true and
I'll go to correct them and then you're
right it becomes a rabbit hole because
probably 50% of the people I'm
responding to they're not even they have
no interest in like oh okay I was
factually wrong well here's that like
they don't it could be a right-wing or
trolling or it could be just a troll
trolling for trolling sake yeah or you
know like every now and then you might
get somebody who's like oh [ __ ] my bed
but most of the time it's like it's not
like an actual exchange because that's
what happens I think when you're on the
internet that's what it's like you're
not gonna get exchanges that are like
regular colleges because you're not
sitting face-to-face with the person and
you don't have you don't feel like the
other person's human you know yeah yeah
when it's online you could [ __ ] on
somebody and then just act like it's
totally fine because you're not you're
so disconnected from that person that
doesn't [ __ ] matter
yeah imagine like being at a [ __ ] gas
station and like just being like hey
like you you left your gas pump open and
if someone's like oh yeah thanks so much
man appreciate that but like if that
went down on Twitter like just some
little [ __ ] like that like just a little
comment someone will be like well you
know gas pumps technically can stay open
for five plus hours alone without you
noticing and commenting on like then
you're just like yeah there'd be a fight
it's just a whole big fight that like in
real life you're right like some [ __ ]
that you would say to someone they would
just take it and be like okay yes no
I'll probably get back on there okay so
here are the rock versus stone cold is
one
hmm that's a good poll that is a really
good one um I'm gonna
omit the ones there I'm like favorite
porn but didn't even give options like
missionary verse doggie verse reverse
cowgirl verse I had a friend who went to
the Chicago car show the other day and
they had little iPads next to all the
new computers
he put youporn on all he sent me a snap
and it was just like he was looking at
the car and they fanned out to the iPad
and it had you born on it and then he
walked away I was like that's so genius
they didn't put the [ __ ] like kid
little lock on it and for know anyway
you go to the MAC store and get on
browsers I'm sure they party blocking in
the next door there's a lot of places
where you can um do you remember in high
school I think it was high school they
used to block certain like webpages that
you like couldn't go to or something
like that but there was always a way to
like go around it
yeah like google the website and then
like find a link within the website and
get in there somehow did your parents
ever have the lock on your [ __ ] no that
no they didn't on me either I think I
don't I think I told the story once on
air about how I went up when I was young
I went to a porn site and then like the
next day my mom was using the computer
it's yours she found the thing cheese
like Kyle did you do this and I was like
oh she got pink yeah oh man
it used to be a site called white house
dot-com but it was born there I don't
know if it was Dahmer dotnet or some
[ __ ] it was an old White House dot
something and then somebody had told me
about it in school like hey man if you
go to this [ __ ] they won't even know
it's porn because it's [ __ ] it's
white house dot whatever and I was like
oh my god that's so brilliant and then I
and then I went to it but the problem is
like you know how sometimes when you
type a link in you type something in and
press Enter for a website other shows
after it yeah so it was like white house
calm slash come jizz balls so my mom
found it she's like this is you I didn't
fess up to it I was like no
Oh knew that [ __ ] wasn't gonna put you
on blast I sort of respect her for that
I was I was young man that was I and
then I remember I told somebody you know
who this is because I've told you this
story off air but there's this dude who
we knew and I told him in class we were
talking and I was like yeah man
did you know that if you like jerk your
dick long enough white stuff will come
out he was like what I was like yeah
that happens he's like no so yeah go try
it yeah I mean at a certain age you got
to figure that [ __ ] out yeah you know I
I had to I figured it out before like
nobody told me yeah I think I had I
think it was like a rumor and then I
tried it and then on like the sixth
attempt it worked
because I had done it a few times and it
didn't work and I was like why is this
not working and then I was like you know
what I'm just gonna keep going until it
[ __ ] works and then I did it until
worked I was like oh my god it's real
it's not fake oh I was amazed by it yeah
I'm sure I mean that's a [ __ ]
fascinating thing to see it's like some
fireworks with some shoot it's not that
special imagine fireworks came out of
your dick hole okay so we got rock burst
stone cold
can you throw a like hold Colgan and
macho man on that [ __ ] or is it just
like national that's that's like you
know limited to the Attitude Era I think
I feel like mankind was in there in that
error like making a strong case well
here's a good one New World Order verse
degeneration X that's good that's a good
one too yeah let's see put a Gatorade
Gatorade flavors the UM the light blue
[ __ ] is that Arctic blue ha but see if
you start adding and now you got to go
with just a classic you gotta go with
blue red blue green orange green or

think blue would smack that it would be
blue red I'm very confident it'll be
blue red
our yellow aren't our orange yellow blue
red yellow which is your favorite blue
me too yeah blue is banging the blue one
the dark blue one is good and then they
came out with a light blue one which is
even better I like all of those like
they came out with like a like a light
greenish one I even like that jizz
colored white one oh that one's good the
Arctic shits
my favorite is blue and then red and
then orange and then yellow but what was
it blue or red orange yellow that's my
word I think that's what I think it's
gonna be too yeah I think it's gonna be
that too mm-hmm okay so that one's out
let's do D Generation X person New World
Order that's the tough thing key X wins

wrestler stone cold verse the rock
what's Attitude Era Attitude Era is like
the era after where they were WWF
stopped caring about being like
kid-friendly and started off doing sex
jokes and showing titties and [ __ ]
yeah they sort of got a little raunchy
yeah that was that was actually right
when we were in like middle school in
high school that's when they were in the
Attitude Era and it was good it's it's
widely viewed as like one of the best
wrestling eras oh yeah today's nonsense
yeah I saw a highlight of Ric Flair like
straight making out with a girl and like
in the ring and I think it was from well
he was older it might've been the tail
end of every Ric Flair was born old yeah
I know that's true he really at like
they said oh his hair is blond didn't
some [ __ ] I saw but no it's like that
[ __ ] has always been like white yeah he
came out with that [ __ ] hair he
looked like he looked now just as a baby
like one of those plush pillow yeah a
hundred percent he was born with like
wrinkles in that hair and [ __ ] he came
out like well whoa makes you boy

nutmeg hazelnut it's like it's some kind
of nut no pun intended you're right it's
like hazelnut and [ __ ] things too
hastily yeah that's it we're good with
those few I mean we could do New York
for Chicago pizza but I think New York
will crush that [ __ ] yeah I think
there's more than New Yorkers to revolt
in that [ __ ] yeah in New York Pete I
mean Chicago pizza is good but it's not
it's not Nana Eric's good cuz it's just
quick easy like slice you could just
down that [ __ ] yeah you said Chicago is
like a literal pie yeah you got it it's
like a hole it's a whole thing
it's a whole meal okay I think well I
think we'll leave it at that for today
all right so I have a little surprise
for everybody come my next show I got
this awesome light hanging in the studio
now like above you like a halo no it's
um it's over my right hand shoulder so
so there's the two TVs behind you now
one of those TVs drop down big time and
then this studio light it's kind of like
a bar light says the Kyle kolinsky show
that's above that TV and that it's hot
it's really hot
and I can me I'm like yes and then I
push forward the other TV and I want to
play videos on that when I want to show
a video oh yes I switched it up a little
bit in terms of in instead of cutting to
a video where I say like okay let's
watch this now it's gonna be I could
play it and I like that a little better
because then I'll be more inclined to
stop it and talk about it as I go as if
you'll still be on the screen when the
videos yeah showing yeah and I used to
do do like I used to play the whole [ __ ]
to say it's a two-minute clip I'll play
the two-minute clip and then respond to
every point after but if I do it this
way I could it's easier to just stop and
I could talk a little bit play stop talk
a little bit play if I if I want to on a
servo though but the thing about it was
it was a [ __ ] pain in the ass man to
get it to get it in like nothing's
[ __ ] easy no nothing's easy I was
amazed by like so to [ __ ] measure it
and then there was the drilling into the
ceiling and foam and like all this [ __ ]
and you got to do everything exactly
right and then when you're done I looked
at it on the camera
way too bright [ __ ] was just [ __ ]
like almost you couldn't make out parts
of the light because it was so bright
because like this is [ __ ] miserable
but then I you know that's when you have
to just keep [ __ ] with it I went into
the manual brightness thing on the
camera and I had to touch different
parts of the screen to like okay lower
this [ __ ] and it would go down and then
it started to look good but then I was
pitch black and then I was like I gotta
brighten this part of the screen and
[ __ ] make this part of the screen
darker it's oh there's a giant pain in
the ass but at the end of it I was like
okay finally it looks like it worked and
it still I'm still probably gonna [ __ ]
it up in eight different ways come the
first show I'm surprised you stayed with
it and not just like which is like [ __ ]
it I'm leaving it
wellthank after the fourth attempt well
see that's the thing about me is that I
like I like having a schedule and stick
into my schedule and going through my
stuff but when something deviates from
the schedule will [ __ ] annoys the
[ __ ] out of me and this is one of those
examples like I don't want to spend half
the [ __ ] day trying to figure out and
that's the point is like when people
look at it on-screen they're gonna be
like oh number one that looks good but
number two that probably took a few
minutes just to put it
no that ship took half a [ __ ] day it
was like four hours of [ __ ] and it was
just a [ __ ] pain in the ass but
thankfully now it's over
hopefully hopefully I'll like it like
this and keep it like this and hopefully
first yeah the first video that's just
gonna like fall on your head or
something it's always what happens the
first video in the new studio was like
the camera was [ __ ] crooked well
actually what's interesting is the
camera wasn't crooked the camera was
perfectly level when it needed to be
crooked like isn't that weird that I
made sure I was like okay I'm gonna make
the camera perfectly level and I made a
camp
I made it level and then everybody in
the video was like this [ __ ] is crooked
as [ __ ] and also you had to probably
would piss so many people like if you
had you had to slant it yourself a
little bit so I had a net then I realize
afterwards I'm like okay so the move is
not to make it level because if I make
it level it's gonna look crooked the
move is to make it look straight even
though it's not straight so you look at
the screen and go okay that looks
straight you and then you look at the
leveler thing and it's totally out of
whack it's like your [ __ ] is crooked
[ __ ] 14 degrees but being crooked 14
degrees makes it look level you see I'm
saying not at all I think you do see
what I'm saying so I made it level the
first time to record a show in the new
studio but a camera looking level in the
studio looks [ __ ] crooked a camera
sitting level looks crooked when you
look at it on the video okay and so I
had to make the camera crooked in order
to make it look straight in order to
make it look level so that's sort of
like the rearview mirrors [ __ ] like the
[ __ ] could be slanted as [ __ ] but it is
like straight and you're in your mirror
no not really
oh because that I could see is like you
sometimes have to turn that downward and
diagonal but you could still see your ol
window okay then yeah that is kind of
like what I'm talking about like you you
needed it's super crooked just to see it
right just to see properly
that makes it yeah that's kind of like
what it is with the camera okay so but
it's a good point is it's always a
[ __ ] learning experience I the lights
were too bright and washed me out for
years and you know there's all these
[ __ ] issues that's that's what
happens it's it's a learning experience
which is why you know something you're
gonna get blowback from people
regardless son
matter what even if it's a clear or like
step in the right direction for 80% of
the audience they're still gonna be 20
well that's what happened when I changed
the picture I changed my picture and
people were like you look like a vice
principal I changed the back I was like
all right you guys win I'll change him
oh you changed the back yeah I changed
it back and got rid of the I took the
orange man picture and I need are
enjoyed it a little bit oh really yeah I
just changed like the lighting [ __ ]
like got rid of some brightness or some
[ __ ] I don't know what situation yeah it
was all right but I just changed the
saturation a little bit tweaked it a
little bit but yeah there's always gonna
be issues where people are even if it's
a step in the right direction 20 percent
will be like put it back yeah
so remember remember your your aim chat
thing you can put a little icon yeah in
a corner mm-hmm
I think I used to have on the dude from
Jimmy Neutron his boy call Weezer yes it
used to be in my corner man I loved aim
aim was so great so it was so weird
though like why would I put him
oh why would you put that guy well yeah
like why would anybody put anything whoo
we didn't put some weird [ __ ] on there
anything yeah that's that's like a given
it's like people with their skype [ __ ]
now they'll put some random [ __ ] you
know yeah they should bring back those
[ __ ] chat rooms like there's no real
chat rooms anymore
there were probably so many pedophiles
oh there was so much pedophiles going on
we might be witnessing a sea change on
the issue of guns at the moment so for
one thing many of the mass shooting
victims friends from the shooting in
Florida are now in the public eye and
they're speaking out in a stronger way
than I've ever seen on any other issue
so I want to take a look at that here
here's a little clip from a speech by a
student named Emma Gonzales terrible
tragedy and how it should never happen
and maintain telling us nothing is going
to be done about it I'm gonna happily
ask him how much money he received from
the National
[Applause]
because I already know number of gunshot
victims in the United States in the 1
and 1/2 months in 2018 alone that comes
out to being fifty eight hundred dollars
is that how much these people are worth
to you Trump if you don't do anything to
prevent this from coming continuing to
occur that number of gunshot victims
will go up and the number that they are
worth will go down and we will be
worthless to you to every politician who
was taking donations from the NRA shame
on you
if your money was as threatened as us
would your first thought me how is this
gonna reflect on my campaign which
should I choose or would you choose us
and if you answered us will you act like
it for once you know what would be a
good way to act like it I have an
example of how not to act like it in
February of 2017 one year ago President
Trump repealed an Obama era regulation
that would have made it easier to block
the sale of firearms to people with
certain mental illnesses
from the interactions that I had had
with the shooter before the shooting and
the information that I currently know
about him I don't really know if he was
mentally ill but I still I wrote this
before I heard what Delaney said Delaney
said that he was diagnosed I don't need
a psychologist and I don't need to be a
psychologist to know that repealing that
regulation was a really dumb idea
Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa was the
sole sponsor on this bill that stops the
FBI from performing background checks on
people adjudicated to be mentally ill
and now he's stating for the record well
it's a shame that the FBI isn't doing
background checks on these mentally ill
people holed up
you took that opportunity away last year
so that's incredible for a variety of
reasons I mean first of all you would
never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever
ever see elected Democrats be that
aggressive and that forthright and that
concise in their messaging and if they
were that would land in a way that you
have no idea how much that would
reverberate through society and how much
people would appreciate arguments like
that because she's really cutting
through the [ __ ] and getting to the
heart the heart of the issue hey you
took she said 30 million I read I read
21 million put look at the debate we're
having is the 21 hours of 30 was [ __ ]
ridiculous either way he took a colossal
amount of money from the NRA and now
shocker he likes to sit on his [ __ ]
fat ass while kids are getting
slaughtered and he doesn't propose any
idea that would fix it now the common
dodge from the right is was really
mental hell is about mental health so we
need to address that really then why did
you guys try to repeal Obamacare 60
times and why did you guys destroy
Obamacare Trump did through executive
orders and why are you guys trying to
cut Medicaid right the [ __ ] now
so okay you say this is about mental
health great then I I guess you're gonna
support a bill that allows universal
access to psychologists and
psychiatrists under a medicare-for-all
system right no you're not because
you're [ __ ] liars that's what you are
you're deflecting that's what that's
called
it's deflection it's
fushion they're gonna do nothing about
this nothing so here you have a student
who's doing what elected Democrats
throughout the country should be doing
but they're not she has to do it after
she saw her [ __ ] friends get killed
and you wouldn't ever even see the media
do this like again the job of the media
is to hold people in power accountable
and get the truth out there and get
facts out there you would think that
somebody in the media would go okay hey
let's do an objective breakdown on what
happens with guns in the United States
versus guns in other countries and you
will see very quickly that we have way
more mass shootings than any other
country and we have way more guns than
any other country so maybe there's a
[ __ ] connection there and maybe it
makes sense to do a universal background
check and a high-capacity magazine ban
and some other gun reforms but no nobody
in the media would bring that up nobody
in the media you're gonna see people on
[ __ ] you can see Wolf Blitzer go
Donald Trump took 21 million dollars
from the NRA and now he's doing nothing
and he's their puppet you're never gonna
see him do that it's taking a victim's
friend in a Florida shooting a high
schooler to make the arguments the
Democrats should be making so all the
credit in the world to her and [ __ ] the
elected Democrats and [ __ ] the media for
not making this argument and there's
more here I want to show you some of the
students they sat down on the show Face
the Nation and here's what they said
March for our lives has support from
everybody and at the end of the day this
isn't a red and blue thing this isn't
Democrats and Republicans this is about
everybody and how we are begging for our
lives and we are getting support but we
need to make real change here and that's
exactly what we're going to do so Emma
what is the plan you say you want to
spark the national movement it's one
thing to talk about it it's another
thing to actually make it happen what
are you going to do well what we have
set up right now we have a website March
for our lives we're going to be doing a
march in March on Washington where we
get students all over the country are
going to be joining us these kids are
going to make this difference because
the adults let us down
and at this point I don't even know if
the adults in power who are funded by
the NRA I don't even think we need them
anymore because they're gonna be gone by
midterm election there's there's barely
any time for them to save their skins
and if they don't turn around right now
and state their open support for this
movement they're going to be left behind
because you are either with us or
against us at this point we are giving a
lot of the politicians that we feel
neglected by a clean slate because
that's the past and we understand that
but from here on we are creating a badge
of shame for any politicians who are
accepting money from the NRA it is a
special interest group that has most
certainly not our best interests in mind
and this cannot be the normal this can
be changed and it will be changed and
anybody who tells you that it can't is
buying into the basada that's being
created by the people who have our blood
on their hands
David a lot of people saw the reporting
that you did from inside the school
while the shooting was taking place and
I'm truly sorry that that all of you had
to live through that but I want to read
to you what President Trump said last
night he said that it's actually the
Democrats that have let you down because
they didn't pass legislation when they
controlled Congress does he have a point
President Trump you controlled the House
of Representatives you control the
Senate and you control the executive you
haven't taken a single bill for mental
health care or gun control and passed it
and that's pathetic we've seen a
government shutdown we've seen tax
reform but nothing to save our
children's lives are you kidding me
you think now is the time to focus on
the past and not the future to prevent
the death of thousands of other children
you sickin I just want to say something
I've heard a lot is the word gun rights
and that has the connotation that we are
trying to strip people of their rights
well first of all we have the right to
live and second of all here at March for
our lives at least for me we don't want
to take the guns away from Americans my
father is a police officer he has guns
and I understand that having concealed
weapons is good for protecting yourself
but an ar-15 is not needed to protect
your house from robbers it's not
to hunt bears an ar-15 is a weapon of
war and a 19 year old who is mentally
challenged and has problems was able to
buy an ar-15 easily we don't want to
disarm America we want to make America
have to work for their weapons and we
have to make sure that everybody who has
this kind of power in their hands has
been cleared to have it because if
Nicholas Cruz had gone through five
minutes with any medical professional
they would have said this person does
not need an ar-15 this person needs a
counselor and 17 people would not have
needed graves god damn man god damn this
moment feels different it really does I
don't know exactly why I mean I guess
it's because the students are taking the
lead these people were just in a school
as a mass shooting happened and they saw
their friends get [ __ ] gun down but
this one feels different I know there
was more I don't know the right word for
it
there was more concision and more
directness and less [ __ ] on this
issue in that short clip than on
anything I've ever heard any Democratic
politicians say on this issue ever there
was no beating around the bush there was
no flowery rhetoric it was all directly
to the point hey we would need something
to be done here's generally what we
support we're gonna march on this issue
to show everybody how serious we are on
it one of the kids said to Trump shame
on you shame on you because Trump said
hey the Democrats hit you no blame them
because there was a time that they had a
supermajority they didn't get anything
done that's half true but the part of it
that's not true is [ __ ] you control
everything right now so go do something
right now if you're saying hey he should
have done something when he had control
okay but by your own logic you should do
something now because you have control
do it do it but no they're not doing it
but again this is what a moment this is
because it's almost like the younger
generation got so fed up and then they
witnessed this and then it all it's all
just it's all out there now there are
real
you [ __ ] have been sitting
around doing nothing taking checks from
the NRA as you let 32,000 people die
every year in this country from guns
about 10 to 12 thousand homicides every
year don't tell me there's nothing you
could do that's just not true of course
there's something you can do you're
choosing not to do it so we're gonna
[ __ ] make you do it how about that
and they're right man so this one does
feel a little different I don't know if
anything will happen I mean after Sandy
Hook when we didn't get gun control we
didn't get any kind of gun reform you
know every reasonable people were saying
including myself well this didn't change
the something's gonna change us but this
one is like it's a tipping point a
little bit it feels like because now the
kids are speaking out and man are they
they're they're made for this moment
they're all really good they all the
points they're making are all great and
I love how they kept hammering away on
money in politics because that's the
main thing and you know they probably
already have made the connection but if
they have and wait until they make the
connection of oh [ __ ] that's how our
entire country's [ __ ] run you think
money in policy is the problem when it
comes to guns well wait till you see
what it does to our economic policy you
know that's exactly why
Wall Street keeps getting deregulated
and we keep having [ __ ] giant crashes
and that's why wages for the
working-class have been stagnant since
1980
that's why unions are on the decline
that's why we don't have a living wage
that's why we don't have Medicare for
all
because for-profit health insurance
companies bought our politicians so the
issue of money and politics is polluting
every issue in the United States of
America and that's why our government
routinely has like a 14 percent approval
rating when you ask hey what do you
think of Congress it could be just after
you elect them and their approval
ratings like 20% because our systems
[ __ ] broken and these kids are
pointing it out a hell of a lot better
than any elected Democrat has pointed it
out and the final point here is so this
it does feel different this time around
but but there's another reason why it
feels different not just these kids who
are doing a fantastic job but look at
this top GOP donor I will not write
another check until candidates support
assault weapons ban so that's the only
way that will really get action on this
issue not just when one top Republican
donor says I'm not going to write
another check until you do something on
guns but when you actually have a
coalition of top Republican donors top
corporate donors who say no we're not
gonna donate you until you do something
about this issue and that's it's
possible that that happens I mean it's
possible that we're faced with a
scenario where all of the big money
that's not aligned with guns lines up
against guns so you'll have the gun
lobby versus every other Lobby and then
obviously every other Lobby is gonna win
because they have more money than the
gun lobby that's the sad reality is that
you're not really gonna get change on
this until you threaten the funding
sources for Republican politicians the
NRA
this is one of those rare this issue of
guns is one of the rare issues where
almost all the Democrats have their
hands clean because they don't take NRA
money there might be a small number who
do but the overwhelm over 90% of
Democrats take no NRA money so they're
gonna be on the right side of this issue
when it comes to voting but the
Republicans you can put enough pressure
on them other donors can put enough
pressure on them where they feel like I
will if I vote with the NRA I will net
lose more money for my reelection
campaign so I can't vote with the NRA
anymore I think that's the only thing
that'll really get this to change but it
would be nice if the Democrats had teeth
and they don't even when they even when
the Democrats are actually right on on
the issue like on gun reform they don't
know how to fight for their position
which is the most embarrassing thing
ever and we'll get to a story on that in
a second with just how clear it is that
the American people want gun reform but
these kids did a fantastic job and
hopefully we see more Republican donors
move against the NRA and then that's
really the thing that will maybe make
this instance different
Robert Muller has a new round of
indictments in his investigation that
broke over the weekend so this here is
from CNBC they say Special Counsel
Robert Muller Russians conducted
information warfare against us during
election to help Donald Trump win
special counsel Robert Muller said a
grand jury had indicted 13 Russian
nationals and three Russian entities for
alleged interference in the 2016
presidential election the defendants
allegedly conducted information warfare
against the United States election
process to help Donald Trump win the
defendants used fake American personas
social media platforms and other
internet media to advance their scheme
according to an indictment so let's dive
into the article itself we're gonna go
through the whole thing and as we go
along here and at the end I'll break it
all down for you and try to put it in
context and explain what it all means so
they say a federal grand jury has
indicted 13 Russian nationals and three
Russian entities for alleged illegal
interference in the 2016 presidential
elections during which they strongly
supported the candidacy of Donald Trump
special counsel Robert Muller's office
said Friday the indictment said that a
Russian organization called the internet
research agency sought to age
information warfare against the United
States to quote sow discord we've heard
that one before so discord in the
American political system by using
fictitious American personas and social
media platforms and other internet-based
media Internet research agency a so
called troll farm based in Saint
Petersburg Russia was allegedly
controlled by a defendant in the
indictment named I'm gonna butcher this
like crazy you have given e frog as in
who is a wealthy associate of Russian
President Vladimir Putin the indictment
said the internet research agency was
registered with the Russian government
as a corporate entity in 2013 and by May
2014 the group strategy
included interfering with the 2016 US
presidential election with the stated
goal of spreading distrust towards the
candidates and the political system in
general remember these words because
that's all important spreading distrust
towards the candidates and the political
system in general the indictment said
the indictment details in extremely
sophisticated conspiracy in which
defendants traveled to the United States
to conduct research employed specialists
to fine-tune social media posts to
ensure they appeared authentic and stole
real people's identities to purchase
online ads by early to mid 2016 the
defendants were supporting the
presidential campaign of then candidate
Donald J Trump and disparaging Hillary
Clinton the eight count indictment
charges the defendants also engaged in
operations to denigrate Republican
primary opponents of Trump such as
senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Florida's
Marco Rubio the indictment said some
defendants posing as US persons and
without revealing their Russian
Association communicated with unwitting
individuals associated with the Trump
campaign and with other political
activists to seek to coordinate
political activities foreigners are
barred from spending money to try to
influence the outcome of a federal
election as part of their efforts the
defendants also allegedly encourage
minority groups to either not vote in
the general election or to vote for a
third party candidate both actions would
have hurt Clinton who receives
significant support from minority voters
and after the election of Trump as
president in November 2016
the defendants used fake personas to
organize and coordinate political
rallies in support of Trump while also
doing the same to create rallies
protesting the results of the election
the indictment said on one day November
12 2016 the defendants organized a rally
in New York to show your support for
president elect Donald Trump while at
the same time organizing a Trump is not
my president rally that also that
also was held in New York Deputy
Attorney General rod Rosenstein said the
defendants created hundreds of accounts
using fake personas on the social media
platforms Facebook Twitter and Instagram
to advance their scheme one example of
that was the Twitter account
Tennessee GOP which used the handle T en
ten underscore GOP and which falsely
claimed to be controlled by US state
political party the indictment said over
time the Tennessee GOP account attracted
more than 100,000 online followers the
defendants also allegedly used a
computer infrastructure based partly in
the United States to hide the Russian
origin of their activities and to avoid
detection by US authorities Rosenstein
said there is no allegation in the
indictment that any American was a
knowing participant in the scheme nor is
there any allegation that the scheme
affected the outcome of the election one
more time on this paragraph because boy
is that [ __ ] important Rosenstein said
there is quote no allegation in the
indictment that any American was a
knowing participant in the scheme any
American so I guess that includes Donald
Trump nor is there any allegation that
the scheme affected the outcome of the
election that seems pretty important to
me all the defendants are charged with
conspiracy to defraud the United States
three defendants are charged with
conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank
fraud and five defendants are charged
with aggravated identity theft none of
the defendants is in custody the
indictment came four days after an
American named Richard Pinedo Pinedo
however the [ __ ] you say that pleaded
guilty to using identities stolen from
US citizens to bypass the security
systems of online payment payment
companies pinedo also bought and sold
bank account numbers over the internet
using stolen identities the indictment
said that the internet research agency
was registered with the Russian
government as a corporate entity in 2013
by in or around May 2014 the
organization strategy included
interfering with the 2016 US
presidential election with the stated
goal of spreading distrust toward the
candidates and the political system in
general House Speaker Paul Ryan said we
have known that Russia meddled in the
election but these indictments detail
the extent of the subterfuge the
Russians engaged in a sinister and
systematic attack on our political
system it was a conspiracy to subvert
the process and take aim at democracy
itself
today's announcement underscores why we
need to follow the facts and work to
protect the integrity of future
elections okay so I know that was long
but I felt like it was necessary in this
instance to give you the entire article
so that all of the facts are out there
and then I can turn around and interpret
it so my take on this is very simple all
of the things that are just the most
obvious crimes ever so for example
stealing real people's identities well
that's a crime and you absolutely should
enforce the law to prevent stuff like
that from happening the wire fraud and
bank fraud aggravated identity theft all
these charges to me those are legitimate
because you can't have people just
stealing people's identities and using
it for you know attempting to to swing
an election even if it was ineffectual
and they say hey there's zero evidence
that this affected the outcome of it but
those are crimes and of course you
should go after people for those crimes
now beyond that is this something that
has merited the response that it's
getting in mainstream media I would
argue no because what we're talking
about here is and we have to keep it
real about the reality of the situation
guys these are Twitter trolls they they
took like a dozen Twitter trolls and
they said we're gonna charge them and
you know our hair is going to be on fire
and we're going to act like
this is a giant attack on the United
States of America and if you think I'm
being hyperbolic by phrasing it that way
wait until we get to some tweets here so
that's my general take on it should you
go after the people who did this for
doing identity theft and for doing wire
fraud and bank fraud absolutely you know
just let people get away with crimes
like that but the reaction from the
media the reaction from the Democrats
has been wildly disproportionate to what
actually is going on here
because at the end of the day we're
talking about Twitter trolls who went
out there and remember they explained
it's not just that the Twitter trolls
were supporting Donald Trump the whole
idea was to quote sow discord so after
the election they had rallies in favor
of Donald Trump and they had rallies
against Donald Trump so they ran a
Tennessee GOP Twitter account and they
also you know there were reports from a
few months ago that said they were big
on trying to push black lives matter and
I think this is one of the reasons why
people like me have have been stunned by
the reaction from many people over these
stories is that we're just talking about
Twitter trolls that's what we're talking
about sowing discord is something that
sure you could argue they did it and
that was the goal and that was the aim
but even if they didn't do it I got news
for you it's not like the whole country
would be holding hands and singing
Kumbaya
we're deeply divided with or without any
interference from anybody so let me go
ahead and show you one of the other
aspects of this because one of the
points that I've been making all along
one of the points the jimmy dore has
been making all along and people like
Glenn Greenwald is we've all been saying
well you don't understand is when you
hype this up the Russia hysteria it's
inevitably going to be used they're
going to turn it back around on the left
now that's already happened because look
at what Google's done and what YouTube
has done in terms of the algorithm what
they've done is they've deprioritized
independent news and they've done it
under the guy
of no we're just protecting everybody
from fake news so Russian fake news
exists and it's out there therefore
we're going to deprioritize the Russian
fake news but right along with that
every independent media outlet well we
can't verify that they're totally
trustworthy and straightforward
so we're going to deprioritize them as
well so now I'm deprioritized
a bunch of your favorite political
commentators are deprioritized we're
treated like alex jones as if we're fake
news and you have independent outlets on
the right and the left are deprioritize
so now they they give they take
establishment outlets and those are the
ones that they hold up as Paragons of
virtue and truth-telling and of course
that's a nonsense it was mainstream
media that called torture enhanced
interrogation at the behest of the bush
administration it's mainstream media
that downplayed the the DNC email leaks
which proved that the primary was rigged
against Bernie Sanders its mainstream
media which praised Donald Trump the
most when he bombed Syria what a weird
time to praise him and act like he's
being presidential so mainstream media
spreads fake news all the time but
they're the ones that are being pushed
by the algorithm on Google and on
YouTube and independent media is being
suppressed so under the guise of
fighting Russian fake news and
propaganda they've attacked the left
myself Jimmy Dore print outlets like
alternate and truth out in TruthDig
alternate wrote an article months back
saying our views are collapsing and it's
because Google is hiding our website so
that's one of the main problems with
this Russia hysteria is that they're
taking the fact that Twitter trolls
exist and they go oh my god we needed
another round of cracking down so
Twitter please crack down more on
anything you might think is Russian
propaganda Facebook Facebook decided
we're gonna deprioritize the entire news
aspect of Facebook and they're gonna
push family and friends so that
destroyed a lot of outlets thankfully
Facebook's not our primary primary
source of getting our information out
there but for many outlets it was and
now they're screwed so what you have now
is Democrats
begging for another round of social
media and media censorship as a result
of this because what's the logical
response to this if you think oh my god
Russian trolls swayed the election well
we got to stop Russian trolls from from
swaying any future elections
therefore please Silicon Valley
oligarchs do us a favor and take
everything that you don't think we
should see because it's fake news and
hide it censor it ban it and that's why
this is so scary because if you don't
understand the consequences of this and
how this is going to be used as a moral
panic to crack down on the left well
then you're just not [ __ ] paying
attention so here's another round of it
right now as soon as Muller came out
with these indictments what happened
next well look at this so I tweeted here
we go chickens coming home to roost
again on Dems fomenting Russia hysteria
now your social media arguments in favor
of Jill Stein and Bernie are suspect
because their unwitting Russian
propaganda weird how Russia gate
arguments always backed the
establishment narrative and then you
could see there Vox tweeted an article
Donald Trump Bernie Sanders and Jill
Stein all appear to have been helped by
Russian election interference and then
Politico took it a step further
Sanders silent on claim that Russians
backed him in 2016 so you see what
they're doing there huh they're going
hey Bernie's not even speaking up about
this
so Russians helped him and he's not
speaking up about it is Bernie in
cahoots with the Russians is he a Putin
stooge is he a Kremlin agent I'm just
asking questions here this is like the
definition of McCarthyism and a Red
Scare okay so guess what Bernie Sanders
and he's been doing this all along he
half plays into this Russia hysteria and
so he released a statement saying it so
unfathomable that President Trump hasn't
spoken out and blah blah blah blah blah
well guess what Bernie what you said
wasn't enough it's never gonna be
considered enough to these people you're
already tarred with the notion of
potentially being a Russian
so even after bernie sanders released a
statement on this what happened well
look at what the MSNBC talking heads are
saying this is from re Mel burr Bernie
Sanders response to Muller indictment
does not address that this Russian
operation tried to help his campaign her
indictment just as I reported regarding
Trump that is a remarkable omission I
[ __ ] told you I told all of you this
is how it's gonna be used it's used to
suppress the left at home and it's also
used where the Democrats now make
right-wing arguments against Trump
they're resisting Trump from the right
hey why are you why aren't you putting
more NATO troops on Russia's border I
think you should do a military buildup
on their border haywire
why aren't you even more hawkish in
Syria sure I know you're staying there
indefinitely sure I know you bombed the
Syrian government four or five times
already but hey men I don't understand
some of those bombings didn't look like
real bombings maybe you should bomb the
Syrian government more you're resisting
him from the right which means you've
now all bought into the neocon narrative
why the [ __ ] do you think Bill Kristol
and David Frum have gone right along
with these Russian arguments because all
of their political ends are met by the
arguments the Democrats are making more
more censorship and marginalization of
the left here at home and then it's a
move to the right on foreign policy more
sanctions more escalation over Crimea
more NATO troops on the border with
Russia so move to the right on foreign
policy move to the right at home
domestically so look this is this is
insane this is almost that's almost the
definition of McCarthyism Bernie why
aren't you speaking out against this it
looks like Russia helped you oh you
spoke out against it well I don't know
you still didn't bring up the specific
points that I wanted you to bring up so
that's a remarkable omission Bernie what
are you hiding but it's even worse than
this why they're not just doing it to
Bernie Sanders you know who else they're
doing it to Jeremy
korban now in the UK so Jeremy Corbyn is
the UK's Bernie Sanders he's an
anti-establishment leftist he's in the
Labour Party of course leader of the
Labour Party
look at this meanwhile in the UK the new
Red Scare hits Jeremy Corbyn so they're
mucking up some [ __ ] against Jeremy
Corbyn about this hey are you in bed
with the Russians are you in bed with
everybody what's going on here Jeremy
why are you are you hiding something I
think you're hiding something and listen
this is how the neoliberals and the
corporatists try to win the civil war
that's going on on the left they can't
win on policy substance and ideology
because the populist left is going to
destroy them 100 out of 100 times when
it comes to policy substance and when it
comes to ideology and improving people's
lives so since they can't beat us since
Neo liberals and corporatist can't beat
us well then you have to play dirty and
how do you play dirty simple you just
declare that anybody that believes in
those ideologies and follows those
people Jill Stein Bernie Sanders Jeremy
Corbyn you name it well you're outside
of the realm of respectable debate
you're outside of the the spectrum of
Reason here because you're probably
tainted by Russia you're a Russian
stooge or you're a Kremlin puppet so
we're just gonna draw a clean line and
say you're not even allowed in the
debate and that's how the corporatists
and the Neo liberals try to win this
left-wing civil war that's going on
right now and what's said is I've seen
many people who were on the proper side
of that civil war now they've gone right
down that slippery slope they're there
right down that rabbit hole and I feel
like I'm in the twilight zone
where every virtually everybody's
feeding into this hysteria and they
don't understand the consequences of it
and they don't understand how damaging
it is and they don't understand that
they're being tricked so it's just
really sad now again I said you might
call my points hyperbolic when I showed
you how this is really about Twitter
trolls and then the reaction from many
people is were under attack
I wasn't being hyperbolic look at this
this is now mein
stream discourse in America this is
centrist Twitter in the US
imagine if FDR discounted the importance
of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor
and focused on how his critics had no
proof that he knew about it
hashtag Russian Pearl Harbor okay that's
not it
Chris Hayes had two politicians on his
the intercept published some DMS that
WikiLeaks had with some of their top
supporters
I believe these DMS date back to about
2015 now some of the stuff in the DMS I
think is personal and I see no value in
discussing it so we're not gonna discuss
it other stuff I would say it's just out
of context smears
and so for example they accuse Assange
of being sexist and anti-semitic I think
the evidence that's presented on that
front is so weak and feeble and wrong
that we're not even gonna bother to
bring it up so I don't buy that at all
but we're gonna put that aside and
discuss a different part of the DMS here
and this I think is interesting I think
it's noteworthy I think it's newsworthy
and I think it merits a broader
discussion now before I continue let me
just say Julian Assange is arguing in
response to this well no you're just
wrong from your premise because though
the article and the intercept assumes
it's Julian Assange running the
wikileaks account and responding to
people through the DMS and the wikileaks
account this entire time he goes
actually no it's been well known public
knowledge for a while that we have
rotating people who end up running the
the wikileaks account on twitter so it
wasn't me for these instances and you
know therefore don't i don't know why
you're using this try to smear me it's
not true of me okay so I just want to
give you his side of the story and now
let's jump into it and I'll give you
what they said and what's causing a stir
and what my take on it is so in 20 back
in 2015 the WikiLeaks account said in
DMS to some of their friends and top
supporters we believe it would be much
better for the GOP to win
Dems plus media Plus liberals would then
form a block to rein in their worst
qualities with Hillary in charge GOP
will be pushing for her worst qualities
Dems and media and neo liberals will be
mute she's a bright well-connected
sadistic sociopath
and then they continue here GOP will
generate a lot of opposition including
through dumb moves
Hillary will do the same thing but
co-opt the liberal opposition and the
GOP opposition
hence Hillary has greater freedom to
start wars than the GOP and has the will
to do so
so as Glenn Greenwald points out that
yes mainstream media is gonna spin this
a little bit and they're gonna act like
that's it Julian Assange is Pro Donald
Trump now Glenn says well no because you
have to look at the context of his
entire argument what he's saying is hey
maybe in the long run Donald Trump will
be better for left-wing causes that's
Glenn green grin Glenn Greenwald's
interpretation of what Julian Assange
allegedly is saying here or what the
WikiLeaks account is saying here and
yeah I mean in context that's the
argument he's making he's saying hey
listen if Trump wins it actually would
be better in the long run but not
because Julian Assange and/or WikiLeaks
supports right-wing causes but more
because they think it's it's the
backlash effect argument that he's gonna
be so bad that you're gonna there's
gonna be a wave of people on the Left
who are principled and write about
issues overtaking the Democrats and then
that leads to a Democratic Party that's
effectively what it should have been all
along whereas he says if Hillary wins
you make it so that the louder voices on
the Democratic side of the neoliberals
and the GOP will sit silently by while
Hillary starts more wars so actually if
you believe in left-wing causes it would
make it would be better in the long run
of Trump won so that's the argument he's
making now is that an argument that's
true
well I would argue it's half true and
half untrue so what do I mean by that
well I don't I don't like it when people
discussed the 2016 election in a way to
suggest that there was any win
on the table because there wasn't there
was no win on the table at all
again the WikiLeaks account is arguing
well it's better if Donald Trump wins
because that'll lead to a left-wing
backlash and then we'll get good
Democrats finally elected well no you
don't know that at all you don't know
that at all
it's a lose-lose if Hillary wins it to
lose because she's a corporatist
neoliberal war monger if Donald Trump
wins it's a lose because it turns out
ultimately he's a corporatist
neoconservative war monger so that's a
lose-lose
there's no spinning it like oh hey maybe
a positive in them mmm oh no if you're
trying to spin either one as a positive
you're cherry-picking to the point of
absurdity okay so I just want to I just
want to dismiss this notion outright of
any option being a win if Hillary won it
was a loss if Donald Trump won it was a
loss and that's why so many people were
frustrated now to the idea that oh if
Donald Trump wins that'll lead to a
left-wing finally the right people will
take over the left well again that's
half true half untrue so Donald Trump
the theory is oh my god these people
will block Trump from everything he
wants to do that's negative well that
didn't happen
so right now Donald Trump is bombing
eight different countries Obama was
bombing seven Trump added Niger for good
measure so we were bombing seven
countries under Obama which was already
horrific now we're bombing eight
countries under Trump now we're
permanently occupying Syria so the
Democrats did not give an opposition to
that they went right along with it
there was a 432 percent increase in
drone strikes under Trump there was a
report from air wars that just came out
that said that's a trump in one month or
excuse me one year killed more innocent
civilians with drones than Obama did his
entire time in office and that's not
because Obama was good on this issue
it's because Trump is that bad on this
issue because Obama killed 90 percent
the wrong people he just didn't do as
men
drone strikes as Donald Trump so the
Democrats did not at all rein in Donald
Trump when it comes to drones not even
close
Donald Trump loosened the rules of
engagement in Niger specifically and
also Somalia he goes yeah tired of this
thing of hey maybe we kind of have to
wait until it's defensive for us to do
anything let's just get rid of the rules
of engagement and you have a massive
increase in civilian casualties like I
described even though it was already bad
under Obama again if the argument from
WikiLeaks was hey the left is gonna
fight back and stop Trump from doing all
these terrible things well look at what
happen with the Paris climate agreement
Trump pulled out of it and Democrats are
sitting around with their thumbs up
their asses screaming about [ __ ]
stormy Daniels a porn star screaming
about some memo [ __ ] they're mad
because Trump said [ __ ] hole you're
under estimating the ineptitude and how
terrible and weak the Democrats are if
your theory is any Republican president
no matter how bad will lead to a
principled backlash from the Democratic
Party now again you're not gonna get
that principled backlash you do see on
the grassroots there's an attempt okay
we have to try to fight back and have
populist left people take over the party
I know because I co-founded one of those
movements just as Democrats okay its
energy on the Left it's forcing people
like Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker
to stop taking corporate PAC money
that's all good that's all fine and
dandy but the pushback is a hell of a
lot slower than it should be and the
Democratic Party joining this left-wing
movement and actually being principled
is happening 1/100 as fast as it should
in order to be ineffectual opposition to
Donald Trump this Democratic Party is so
weak in their opposition to Trump it
makes me [ __ ] sick it makes me sick
how they sit around while he he just
destroyed our entire tax system made it
so the next crash is going to happen
very soon and at one point four trillion
dollars to the deficit to give 83
percent of the benefits of the tax bill
at the top 1%
raise taxes on everybody making $75,000
a year or less and when the Democrats
were asked hey are you gonna run on this
issue and say we're gonna repeal and
replace Trump's terrible tax bill that
gives all the money to the rich the
Democratic response was no we're gonna
restore balance so the notion that oh my
god Trump would be ineffectual and get
nothing done and [ __ ] the Democrats
would be able to stop him on everything
he does that didn't happen that didn't
happen he's getting a lot of [ __ ]
[ __ ] done even if it's not mostly
through legislation look at all of his
[ __ ] executive orders his shitty
executive orders three million people
got kicked off for health insurance
because in his executive orders you know
for every one new regulation you need to
get rid of to now because of his dumbass
executive orders there they destroyed
the fuel remaining regulations on Wall
Street because of his executive orders
so it's not true to say hey Trump is
going to lead to a backlash that's gonna
know didn't there is a backlash
happening but it hasn't taken root and
it's not the the predominant movement on
the left or for example you wouldn't
have had that story that just came out
about how you have Democratic officials
tell candidates who want to run the
first thing they say is can you go
through your phone and raise like a
quarter of a million dollars right now
and then if the person says no they go
we're not interested in you so you're
gonna tell me that this Democratic party
that has that philosophy is gonna be a
sufficient opposition to Trump they're
not they go along with them the majority
of the time so they're just not so that
theory is wrong the only narrow way in
which it's right is that among the
grassroots you're seeing that kind of a
reaction but the grassroots is still
being held down by the corporatists okay
and then of course there's other
examples the marijuana crackdown there's
no pushback from the Democrats the you
know you have Jeff Sessions doing a
marijuana crackdown right now you have
the Supreme Court the idea was oh my god
if Trump wins well then just have the
Democrats block a vote on this
Republican supreme court pick until the
next democratic president
that's what the Republicans did they
said we're not gonna allow a vote on
Merrick garland no matter what we're
just gonna block them for like over a
year [ __ ] off we don't care [ __ ] you
[ __ ] you so the argument was well let's
if Trump wins hey might be a good thing
because then the Democrats will be able
to do jiu-jitsu and do the same kind of
option and reaction and say we're gonna
not allow you know whoever they pick and
turned out to be Neal Gorsuch on the
course on the court
well they didn't they folded immediately
as I would have I predicted I knew
they're gonna fold because the Democrats
saw they suck so the point you know that
I would argue is it's not better at the
GOP won of course it's not it was a
lose-lose WikiLeaks Assange whoever said
that and that's a that's a naive way of
looking at it like oh maybe it'll be
good if Trump went no it's shitty if
Trump wins it's shitty if Hillary wins
and if you go rigidly and strictly by
the issues it would just be slightly
less shitty if Hillary had won the only
difference as far as I could tell
were those very narrow areas like
Hillary Clinton obviously she wouldn't
have been as shitty with the Supreme
Court cuz she said I would have kept
Merrick garland up who's a shitty
centrist but that's better than
far-right judge like Gorsuch you know
Hillary would not have pulled out of the
Paris climate agreement so slightly
better than Trump on issues of climate
change so there are a few differences
where Hillary was better but my main
argument here is it was a lose-lose
either way and the idea that and I'm
gonna quote it again that we believe it
would be much better for the for the GOP
to win that's naive if you believe in a
left-wing agenda that's naive man it was
a lose-lose and it did not come to
fruition that oh if Trump gets elected
everything he wants to do will be
blocked and Democratic socialists
immediately will take over the party
that didn't happen that didn't happen we
tried
we [ __ ] tried goddamn it we really
did but at the end of the day they're
still the overwhelming dominant force in
the party of the neoliberals which is
why Trump is getting away with so much
of the [ __ ] that he wants to do so I
would just I would just say stay away
from this kind of faulty reasoning
because it is faulty at the end of the
day it is faulty I see the theory he's
laying out but it just turns out to not
be empirically correct by the same token
I don't think the opposite is true
either that's why I said he's half right
half wrong because the opposite argument
is no if Hillary wins then everything
will then it'll be good it wasn't good
if Hillary won it wouldn't have been
good either it just would have been
slightly less shitty
but in either situation you still have
neo liberals being the dominant strain
in the Democratic establishment and you
still have the far-right Neo
conservatives being the dominant strain
in the Republican Party and listen some
people argued hey wait WikiLeaks
released the DNC emails I defend them to
this day doing that and I will continue
to defend them for WikiLeaks released
the DNC emails and I don't even care how
they got them I don't even care if they
got it from Russia fine don't give a
[ __ ] I need it it's good that we saw
that a primary was rigged more truth is
always a [ __ ] good thing okay so it's
a good thing that we saw the leaks of
the DNC emails
some people argue yeah but they should
have released the RNC emails too and to
that I say well maybe they didn't have
access to them but now I get the sense
that even if they did have access to the
RNC emails they wouldn't release them
and maybe I'm wrong and I hope I'm wrong
because I like WikiLeaks but the fact
that they're whoever was running the
account Assange or not was saying we
believe it would be much better for the
GOP to win well that leads me to believe
that yeah they would probably only
release the damaging information on
Hillary because they're saying hey I we
believe it's better for the GOP to win
so if you believe it's better for the
GOP to win why would you leak something
that would hurt their chances right now
again maybe I'm wrong and
I hope to god I'm wrong man I really do
because in my mind if you believe in
leaks in a principled way you should
believe in them in the case of the [ __ ]
are you going on behind the scenes of
the DNC and the definite [ __ ] that is
potentially going on behind the scenes
at the RNC I guarantee you there's a
whole bunch of [ __ ] up [ __ ] going on
behind the scenes at the RNC so I would
just hope that WikiLeaks would be able
to put aside their own personal politics
and do the across-the-board leaks you
know on DNC [ __ ] but also on RNC
[ __ ] and they can put that aside the
fact that in their estimation quote we
believe it would be much better for the
GOP to win so that's my take on it and I
hope moving forward that when we get
leaks the leaks are gonna be in the
interests of the American people
regardless of the partisan politics of
it
because I don't care about the partisan
politics of it I care about exposing
wrongdoing across the board that's my
concern
so we have some pretty surprising and
interesting news for everybody this is
from CNBC Cory Booker joins kirsten
gillibrand
and other Senate Democrats in rejecting
corporate PAC donations senator Cory
Booker fell in line with other high
profile Democrats by vowing to stop
accepting donations from corporate PACs
Booker joins the likes of 20/20 hopefuls
Kirsten Gillibrand Elizabeth Warren and
Bernie Sanders with his pledge okay
so there's lots say about this first and
foremost you have clear jockeying for
position among Cory Booker Kirsten
Gillibrand and Elizabeth Warren moving
into 2020 it's not even close it's
crystal clear some of them have their
heart dead set on running and they're
going to run but having said all that
how are we to take this news that Cory
Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand Democrats
who are solidly in the establishment
wing of the Democratic Party how are we
to take the news that they're rejecting
corporate PAC money well I've seen
responses to this story that almost all
of the responses save one I don't agree
with because some people are overly
optimistic about this and they act like
that's it we're done fly the flag
victory I don't agree with that and some
people are overly pessimistic about this
like nope doesn't matter at all doesn't
count at all because they're corporate
Democrats and that's how they are and
nothing ever changes with that so don't
don't act like it does I don't agree
with that take either I think the answer
is in the middle and I think the
rational National David Dole he's got a
great youtube show you guys should check
it out he did a good video on this when
it was just kirsten gillibrand who and
now she's not taking corporate PAC money
and his position basically sums up my
position and that position is cautiously
optimistic so is this the end-all be-all
that they stopped taking corporate PAC
money
no is it a step in the right direction
yes so I want to show you some charts
here so I can further flesh this out for
you first we're gonna look at Kirsten
Gillibrand's no
here this is the source of her funds
throughout her career or actually I
think it's 2013 to 2018 but that's a
large enough chunk to get a good sense
of how she's been throughout her career
small individual contributions she's
taken four point five million in that
front now those are the what I would
call the good donations that's regular
people saying I like kirsten gillibrand
I think she's gonna fight for me and
fight for regular people so here's some
money that's defined as less than two
hundred dollars a small contribution is
two hundred dollars or less
thirty one point two one percent of her
donations are small contributions okay
then you have large individual
contributions about eight point nine
million that's sixty one percent of her
contributions then you have PAC
contributions about seven point seven or
seven point eight percent and she hasn't
done any self financing now to get rid
of corporate PAC money what that means
is you're not gonna have corporations
officially bundle money give it to her
and the reason why one would forego
those donations is very simple
those definitely come with strings
attached oh you want to take corporate
PAC money well guess what they're gonna
immediately look at you to do their
bidding that's the way corporate PAC
money works if anybody tells you
differently they're idiots like the
Supreme Court for example says nope this
isn't corruption and this isn't even the
appearance of corruption well you're
wrong and you're comically wrong and
you're idiots of course it is if
somebody gives you [ __ ] thousands of
dollars you know you're gonna take that
[ __ ] phone call more than you're
gonna listen to a random grandma in
Kentucky of course that's human nature
so for example the Republicans take you
know Exxon Mobil money well then they're
gonna be they're gonna look at them like
okay you're gonna vote for our subsidy
every year right our corporate welfare
check of four billion dollars a year
right if you take corporate PAC money
from Wall Street they're gonna look at
you like hey the next time a
deregulation bill comes up you're gonna
support it right because that helps us
so you're gonna do that right so that
money definitely comes with strings
attached
so for kirsten gillibrand say I'm not
taking that anymore
good that gets rid of the worst source
of corruption and the most obvious
source of corruption now she's not
foregoing all pac money so in other
words there are some PACs that give for
like women's issues for example
reproductive rights she's like I'll
still take PAC money from them why
because she ideologically agrees with
them and it's not like they're making
her flip her position they just support
her position she says I'm pro-choice
they say hey we're pro-choice - here's
the pac money so she says I'm not gonna
stop taking that I think Union money -
she's not stopping taking which okay you
know that's I mean on 90% of the issues
I agree with the unions so it still has
a corrupting influence but it's a less
corrupting influence it's just not as
damaging a special interest if you will
there are a few issues where I disagree
with them like for example unions were
in favor of like the Keystone XL
pipeline because hey jobs now that
conflicts with what I think the proper
position was because we should care
about the climate and say no we can find
other sources of jobs so no so you might
have Union money have show a conflict of
interest in that sense but overall okay
you want to take Union PAC money you
want to take women's issues PAC money
that PAC money is not nearly as bad as
corporate PAC money Wall Street money so
the worst source of corruption corporate
PAC money she's saying I'm not taking
that anymore that's good now here's the
point that David Doyle made which is a
great point which is what you still have
to look out for in the case of Kirsten
Gillibrand and again I'm not downplaying
the fact that she stopped taking
corporate PAC money that's a good thing
unquestionably a good thing and I'm
giving her credit for that credit where
it's due on that front but what happens
is oftentimes politicians like Kirsten
Gillibrand will have these dinners will
have these parties and it'll be hey
2,000 bucks a plate or the limit 2500
bucks a plate and what they do is you
will invite people from a particular
industry maybe you have a meeting with
goldman sachs and maybe you say hey
we're going to
dinner with people from Goldman Sachs
come on to the dinner 2500 bucks a plate
and then you've packed the room full of
Goldman Sachs people they pay you twenty
five hundred bucks a plate and then at
that cocktail party you have
conversations with these people and
you're absorbing their worldview so when
you get rid of the corporate PAC money
you get rid of the worst source of
corruption there are still sources of
corruption being big-money dinner
parties where admittedly they're staying
under the $2,500 individual cap but the
way in which the dinner party unfolds
and the people you're surrounded by
you're not surrounded by the you know
the blue-collar worker or the accountant
or the teacher you're surrounded by
executives who have a very particular
worldview and you're gonna reflect that
if that's where you're getting a lot of
your money now again in the case of
Kirsten Gillibrand the large individual
contributions defined as above $2,200
usually it's the max of $2,500 that's
sixty one percent of her funding so you
should be happy she stopped taking
corporate PAC money but here's how the
ultimate judge of how corrupt she is or
isn't her voting record so at the end of
the day if she stops taking corporate
PAC money but she supports a bill for
deregulation of Wall Street doesn't
matter much that he stopped taking the
corporate PAC money because you still
voted in the corrupt way at the end of
the day anyway but if you stop taking
the corporate PAC money and you vote
against the deregulation and you vote
for medicare-for-all for example and to
be fair to Kirsten Gillibrand she had
recently come out said I'm a favored
Medicare for all well then that's a good
thing then we'll give you total credit
and listen for Cory Booker and Kirsten
Gillibrand is saying no more corporate
PAC money I need you to understand
something everybody on the Left who was
saying you know what [ __ ] you guys I do
have a purity test how about that
I'm not gonna support you unless you're
for Medicare for all and free college
and a living wage and you stop taking
corporate PAC money everybody on the
Left who was allowed who was aggressive
who was unwilling to compromise
who was saying no I have a purity test
now come get my vote all of you you're
the people to thank for them doing this
you're the people to thank for them
taking a giant step in the right
direction because if it wasn't for you
they wouldn't have done it so all of the
shaming of the Jill Stein voters and the
people on the so-called far left who
said no Hillary's got to earn my vote
they're the ones who earned this you
would have never had Cory Booker and
Kirsten Gillibrand ever come out and say
I'm done taking corporate PAC money
unless they were convinced I have zero
chance in 2020 if I keep taking
corporate PAC money so this is a giant
sea change this is a step towards making
the Democratic Party the party of
workers again now they're not there yet
cuz I just told you 60% 61% of her
contributions are not small donations
they're large individual donations so
we're still not there yet but it's a
it's a step in the right direction so be
cautiously optimistic in the case of
Kirsten Gillibrand just say okay I like
that you stopped taking corporate PAC
money I'm gonna keep my eye on those
large individual contributions but I
just need to I just need to see this
reflected in your voting record okay so
you say you're not corrupt anymore
wonderful vote for a medicare-for-all
vote for free College vote for a living
wage and and then we'll give you even
more credit okay so cautiously
optimistic by the way a good comparison
here what percentage of Bernie's
contributions are small individual
contributions about 80% ideally you'd
want to have all the Democratic
politicians get all of their money
through small individual contributions
now again there's a little bit of wiggle
room there if you want to take a little
bit of Union PAC money or women's issue
PAC money okay that's not as bad
obviously it's corporate PAC money but
the ideal would be small individual
contributions and actually the real
ideal is just have publicly financed
elections clean elections they're not to
worry about any of this private source
of funding but Bernie who's more of the
paragon of being uncorrupted
he's about 80% small individual
donations so Kirsten Gillibrand is
31% small individual donations 61% large
individual donation so just keep your
eye on that but again cautiously
optimistic so now let's move on to cory
booker cory booker is worse
so his small individual contribution is
less than two hundred dollars it's ten
point two four percent so about two
point three million dollars that's lower
obviously that's a smaller percentage
than with Kirsten Gillibrand and
obviously Bernie's is eighty percent in
that category large individual
contributions seventy two point eight
four percent so about sixteen point five
million dollars PAC contributions is
about ten point six two percent so again
with him getting rid of corporate PAC
money don't don't get it twisted
it is it's definitely a step in the
right direction cuz he's saying I'm
gonna get rid of the worst source of
corruption great but again same thing
with cory booker as it is with kirsten
gillibrand
just keep your eye on that large
individual contribution number and also
the next step really is to try to push
people to stop having those fancy
schmancy cocktail parties where you're
in a room with all Wall Street people
who are paying less than the cap of
twenty five hundred dollars per
individual contribution but you're still
absorbing their world view but either
way the more democratic politicians that
say no corporate PAC money the better
that's good and the next step of course
is stop having those dinners with rich
[ __ ]
who give you $2,500 let's push you more
towards this small individual
contribution mold of less than two
hundred dollars and the way that you
start doing better fundraising that way
is very simple just push for the right
policy goals the uncorrupted policy
goals push for Medicare for all in free
college in a living wage and ending the
wars and a new new deal and legalizing
marijuana and to be fair to Cory Booker
he's for legalizing marijuana and he
says he's for Medicare for all now but
if you push for those things in the long
run you're gonna get a lot of small
contributions you're not going to get as
many big contributions and that would be
better at the end of the day so
step in the right direction take a win
where you can get it this is you can
thank a purity test leftist for this
because they're the ones who really are
responsible for getting us this change
and just still keep in mind though that
Wall Street and insurance companies and
pharma are in Booker's top 10
contributors in large donations large
individual donations so keep your eye on
that and you know for Gillibrand I think
Wall Street is still in her top ten
contributors for large individual
contributions now again you want to
compare that to somebody who's really
uncorrupted Bernie's top donors or
Democratic issues groups like for
example we described women's women's
rights groups where they push for
reproductive rights and they donate
money so Democratic issues groups
education they donate a lot to Bernie
Sanders retired people so you really
want to be uncorrupted go towards small
donations from the people by pushing an
agenda that the people want move away
from the large individual contributions
but having said all that it's still a
colossal II positive thing that we now
have Democratic politicians going I'm
not gonna take corporate fact money
anymore because if I keep taking it I
have no chance of never mind winning in
2020 I might not even have a chance of
getting reelected the next time I'm up
for election as a senator so that's
definitely a good thing and let's hope
this trend continues
guys just a quick update to this story
you're about to see the original segment
that I did in a second but during
editing and uploading this story broke
and it's an important update to the
story so I figured I throw this in
beforehand before you see the clip
before we knew this information so the
Daily Beast and and a few other outlets
are reporting that Nicholas Cruz the guy
who did this mass shooting trained with
white supremacists war pro-trump Patton
school
the pro-trump had thing okay I don't
there's a lot of Trump supporters the
overwhelming majority of them are not
terrorists that goes without saying but
trained with white supremacists that's
um yeah that would make him a terrorist
if he if he indeed killed these people
to try to spread his white supremacist
ideology then yeah that would be
terrorism and you should take note of
how many outlets will call this guy a
terrorist now that we know this and it
was a white separatist paramilitary
proto-fascist organization so yeah if
you're doing violence in the name of
that political ideology white
nationalism then that would be the
definition of terrorism so we'll see if
he gets charged with terrorism my guess
is no and we'll see how much the media
refers to him as a terrorist my guess is
they won't refer to him that much as a
terrorist if at all but yeah that is
what this guy is so you can change this
label from mass shooter to terrorist but
anyway now to the original segment and
you will see my breakdown obviously
everything else I say in the segment is
accurate just replace mass shooter with
terrorists we had another gigantic mass
shooting yesterday let me show you some
of the facts of what happened at least
17 people were killed in the school
shooting at least 15 others were
hospitalized
with five individuals sustaining
life-threatening injuries teenagers and
adults are among the victims according
to the Broward County Sheriff's Office
so this happened in Florida at least 12
people were killed inside the school
building two others were killed outside
and another person was fatally shot on a
street corner when the suspect fled the
scene at least two died at the hospital
Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said
at a press conference Wednesday the
sheriff said the 12 victims killed
inside the school have been identified
but law enforcement is not releasing
their names a football coach was killed
and the son of a sheriff's deputy
suffered a non-life-threatening injury
after he was shot in the arm around 2:30
p.m. just before class dismissal the
fire alarm went off and shooting began a
law enforcement official told CBS News
it was believed the suspect pulled the
fire alarm before the shooting rampage
so he the whole idea was let's try to
lure out more people and kill them the
lone suspect and now he's in custody is
19-year old Nicholas Cruz according to
the Broward County Sheriff's Office he
was taken into custody off school
property about an hour after the
shooting and was initially transported
to a nearby hospital he has since been
transferred to the sheriff's
headquarters reports CBS News Cruz is a
former Stoneman Douglas high school
student who had been expelled for
disciplinary issues the sheriff said
though he did not say when or why Cruz
is currently enrolled in Broward County
Public Schools Broward County
Superintendent told reporters at a press
conference Sheriff Isreal said Cruz was
armed with an ar-15 rifle and countless
magazines investigators have begun to
scour Cruz's social media activities and
so far have found quote very very
disturbing materials so he didn't just
have an ar-15 and countless magazines he
also used smoke grenades and this guy
was armed to the teeth so this is uh
this happens way too often in the US
in fact there's sad to say but it's true
just keeps happening that after one of
these instances the onion of course the
satirical news outlet tweets out an
article that they did in 2014 which is
relevant
virtually every month since then and in
that they say there's nothing we could
do to stop this says the only nation
where this occurs regularly and that's
true that's true I mean that's just the
fact of the matter you don't see mass
shootings this often in any other
developed country or even any other
country so that's a fact that's a fact
and it's a a sick one that we have to
digest and understand you know there's a
lot of propaganda out there in regards
to the issue of guns but that's an
inescapable fact and you're you're
kidding yourself you're effectively
brainwashed by a bunch of propaganda and
[ __ ] if you think that you know of
just no worse and dark country than it
is elsewhere yes it is yes it is in fact
I've had conversations with people from
Australia who literally said to me like
oh yeah we would visit America but we're
we're actually scared of being killed in
a mass shooting now if you live in
America you think well come on man and
obviously if you look at the statistics
overall you could go ah come on I mean
even though we have a higher incidence
than other countries it's not like it's
like hey it's gonna happen on any given
Tuesday where you go out in public or
whatever but that's the that's the taste
that's left in people's mouths around
the world when they look at what happens
in the US because it is true that just
it's happening at a record clip no pun
intended using the word clip it just
it's seemingly endless so let me give
you some more information about this
Nicolas Cruise the guy who carried out
the mass shooting he had shot at a
somebody's chickens
not that long ago was a neighbor the
neighbor said this kids messed up he's
killing my chickens or trying to kill my
chickens to be fair I'm not sure if the
chickens are actually dead or if he was
just [ __ ] around and shooting at them
that's one of the first signs of
somebody who's psychopathic is they love
to hurt animals or torture animals
that's one of the first signs they also
say he recently had bitten a child I
don't even know what that means but that
is a sign of some sort of deep
psychological issue he also stood he
also stole residents posts I don't know
what post is mailbox I guess still
residents post and they say he threw
eggs at a neighbor's car while the
neighbor was driving he was banned from
wearing a backpack to school when he
went to school because he had repeatedly
made threats so much that people were
like we don't trust him with something
where he can conceal anything at all he
could conceal stuff in his backpack we
don't trust him he needs to everything
needs to be on out and open when he
shows up somewhere because this dude has
some serious some serious problems so
they spoke to the kids at the school and
virtually all of them said the same
thing any all the ones who knew him they
were like oh yeah we always joked he's
gonna be the next mass shooter this is
so chilling when you go through this
because it's not just that the signs
were there is they were overwhelming
evidence was just screaming at everybody
now perhaps the the most frustrating
part of this in September a Youtube numr
user by the name of Nicholas Cruz
spelled exactly like he spells it it's n
I K oh la s which is not that's not very
common spelling of Nicholas so somebody
by that name on YouTube left a comment
on a video stating quote I'm going to be
a professional
school shooter now the person who posted
that video and it was a video on a
documentary about a mass shooting that
happened in the 1960s but the person who
had that on their channel immediately
contacted the FBI to their credit and
the FBI immediately answered and then
the very next day they when they
interviewed Nicholas Cruz apparently
they missed quite a bit here because he
ended up they ended up not doing
anything so they've interviewed him and
then they thought of her and then they
left and then he was still able to
legally own a gun and pass a background
check
dad takes me off to no end because what
good is the background check if you have
no standards so if the idea is you just
go through the motions like oh okay
we're gonna do background check oh [ __ ]
there's a lot of damaging and
questionable stuff here anyway here
we're gonna sell you the gun now that
was the point of the background check
what was the point of background check I
think there's an implication when all
reasonable people talk about a
background check where if you happen to
come across somebody who has bragged I'm
going to be a professional school
shooter the background check covers that
for those people to say oh we're not
gonna sell you a gun now [ __ ] but no we
have this thing where she's what are we
all on autopilot like oh okay here let
me do the background check there's a lot
of questionable stuff okay I'm going to
sell it to you anyway well no you're
allowed to have standards and your hat
allowed to use human reason and judgment
and you're allowed to be logical about
it and you know that's one of those
things where even if somebody tries to
push back against you you can you can
stand your ground and say no we're not
gonna sell him a gun and nobody should
sell him a gun because look at his
record now I get it some people will say
well he'd go to the black market anyway
but here's the point only some of the
people
who are rejected from buying a gun
legally will have the ability to get
something on the black market not
everybody has the social skills to make
the connections to meet a [ __ ] on the
street gun dealer so you're gonna have a
giant decrease in instances of people
who are gonna carry carry out these
kinds of crimes being able to get their
hand on a on a weapon it makes it harder
that's the point
it's obviously not foolproof it's
obviously not hey you know if you stop
people like this from getting a gun
legally all of them will never be able
to get a gun no obviously in some
instances somebody's gonna go to their
[ __ ] Grandpa's house and find the key
and open his gun to drawer and get a gun
and then go do a terrible thing or some
of them will somehow get the connections
to the black market and get a gun on the
black market but it's all about
disincentivizing as much as possible and
even if you have just only a 50% drop in
the people we're able to get those guns
well then you just save a tremendous
number of lives so I don't for the life
of me I don't understand I mean you
would think that if you're gonna do a
background check on people thing number
one you do it's checked for a comment
like this on their social media accounts
as I even hard to find the [ __ ]
social media account it's as goddamn
regular name is the name used on YouTube
so what kind of what are you doing in
the background check if you're not doing
[ __ ] like this is there no background
check at all is it just hey check the
criminal record and that's it man he
really said I'm going to be a
professional school shooter this is the
second mass shooting we've covered in a
year actually probably in the past six
months where the comment there were
there were comments online from the
person who did the shooting saying
almost exactly that this is the second
one we have to be we just have to be
smarter about this [ __ ] man and
we discussed this about a year ago when
this happened but common sense gun laws
are not debatable among the public but
we have a Republican Party that's
totally bought and owned by the
leadership of the NRA who get their
money from gun manufacturers so they got
even the most basic protections so for
example you had a rule that was put into
place by Obama which said hey listen if
under Social Security it's been
officially determined that you are not
have sound enough mind to control your
finances so in other words you need a
guardian to control your finances for
you because you're not capable enough or
you don't have sound enough mind to
control your finances yourself if that's
the case you're not allowed to get a gun
so okay you're too out there to be able
to control your finances you're too out
there to own a [ __ ] firearm that is
not an unreasonable thing to say in fact
again if you did a poll the overwhelming
majority the America well guess what
Trump signed an executive order that
rolled that back bump stocks is another
example bump stocks change a weapon into
a fully automatic weapon that's
effectively what it does now on paper
fully automatic weapons are banned in
the u.s. so how can you ban fully
automatic weapons but have this gigantic
loophole that allows fully automatic
weapons by another name through another
method and after one of the last mass
shootings we learned oh my god the
person had a bum sock I think it was the
one in Las Vegas when 58 people died 58
people 58 were taken out during a
[ __ ] concert from some [ __ ] in a
hotel room shooting at him I think
that's the one where he had the bump
stock we didn't even bend the bump
stocks after that guys we don't even
have a universal background check 93% of
the American people say we want a
universal background
93% if 93% of the public want something
and you can't get it you don't have a
representative democracy on paper the
u.s. is a constitutional republic and a
representative democracy you can get rid
of that representative democracy part if
that's the case because there's 93% of
people wanted you don't get it well what
do you need 94 95 96 % but that's it it
has nothing to do with what you want
the NRA money controls the Republican
Party and they block any movement to try
to fix these things at all even the most
basic things Marco Rubio was on Twitter
after the shootings and thoughts and
prayers thoughts and prayers with the
people who are affected by this and
everybody pointed out you've taken
literally over three million dollars
from the NRA you scumbag so don't don't
give me that nonsense it's just a
platitude
yeah whatever here I'm gonna throw some
nonsense that doesn't mean anything at
you after your children your child got
slaughtered massacred and I'm not gonna
do anything to change it while people
are tired of the inaction man do
something and don't don't get it twisted
um I'm actually relatively moderate on
the issue of gun violence in the sense
that you know I'm in favor of some
regulations but I'm not in favor of
certain measures that I would consider
extreme so there is room for reasonable
debate and disagreement on this issue
but what's not debatable is hey do we
have it nailed right now because the
answer that it's [ __ ] no I mean people
argue people like to argue on the on the
far right if they're on solidly on one
side of this issue they say well the
bottom line is more guns equals more
peace that's what they argue and they
say you know how I know that there are
more good people in the world than bad
people so if you arm everybody well the
good people with guns outnumber the bad
people with guns therefore the good
people with the guns keep the bad people
with the guns in check so that's a
theory that's a hypothesis here's the
only problem with that you have to
empirically test it to determine whether
or not it's true and when you run the
experiment it turns out that's just not
true so the United States is just
absolutely swimming in a soon
me of weapons we have over over 300
million weapons so we have more guns
than any other developed country and
guess what we actually have more gun
violence so that theory is factually
incorrect hey more guns equals more
peace well the you the US has the most
guns and we have less peace we have more
gun deaths so you're just wrong I don't
know how I was gonna say it you're wrong
you're incorrect we ran the experiment
we see the numbers you're just wrong
sorry now I would have more respect for
those people if they just came out and
said yeah you know what we're gonna have
a higher gun death rate but I don't care
cuz hashtag freedom okay that's a fair
argument you could take that position
that's fine you can make that argument
now I'm not gonna begrudge you that I
might disagree with you I at least
disagree with you a little bit cuz I'm
in favor of some moderate regulations
but just be honest about what your
position is you can't don't lie about it
and say oh we have more guns but that's
gonna be more peace that's just not true
so I saved a few facts here for you at
the end of the story that should put
into perspective just how bad this issue
is of gun violence in America roughly
one hundred and eighty five thousand six
hundred and forty eight people have died
from guns in the US since the shooting
and Sandy Hook
when was Sandy Hook I think it was 2012
right so twenty twelve thirteen fourteen
six years one hundred and eighty five
thousand six hundred forty eight people
have died from guns in the US and Sandy
Hook Sandy Hook doesn't feel like it was
that long you know what that means we've
had three Viet Nam's
in our own borders from guns since Sandy
Hook we've had about 26 wars on terror
in our borders since Sandy Hook let
those facts sink in
don't tell me we can't do anything we
should have a universal background check
with strict standards where if you find
something like a post on social media
I'm going to be a professional school
shooter you go okay no you're not
getting a gun and there should be
penalties if they that person gets sold
to gun legally to the people who sold
them the gun of course so universal
background check with reasonable
standards in place of course a ban on
high-capacity magazines should be in
place so that if somebody has to reload
more often you're making it possible
they were during one of these shootings
you could have somebody tackle them and
you should also generally treat guns
like cars I don't think that's too much
to ask people we look at cars like oh
that's a weapon so you need to pass a
test in order to drive a car now some
people would say well listen but that's
it you don't have a right to a car in
the Constitution you have a right to a
gun in the Constitution but here's the
problem with that argument that doesn't
mean you can't have basic regulations on
that right so I agree you can't ban guns
we agree but can you regulate them of
course you can somebody can't walk
around and say oh I think I have a right
to an RPG or a chemical weapon or a
nuclear weapon no we go that's a weapon
that you're not allowed to have now is
that a restriction of their rights no
just like even with the First Amendment
and free speech you can't do libel or
slander that's against the law
hard to prove rightfully so but against
the law you can't do direct threats of
violence direct specific threats of
violence that's against the first moment
you're not allowed to do that even
though we have an absolutist free speech
stance in this country so you can have a
right to bear arms while understanding
hey you got a pass universal background
check you we can't have high-capacity
howdy everybody hello welcome to the
jungle it's weird how howdy was a thing
you know how people sit like that was
their greeting mmm bunch of wheel
readings over the year oh yeah from time
to time our only texts should they
definitely say how do you say Hawaii
they say but it's making a comeback
Jimmy Dore who's my friend who has a
show as well he his co-host opens with
how he says howdy howdy when he does the
show he just opens with that you know
it's a things come in and out Howard
Stern you say hey now right yes somebody
said yeah so no but it was like a like
howdy was like a like an actual greeting
right yeah well yeah it was it still is
people I mean the way the language
always changes a little bit like they
used to do the you ever heard those like
cops and robbers talk from the 1920s
like alright see I'm gonna tell you I
always say see at the end of it I'll
listen here see I'm gonna put your hands
up put them up put them up put them up
stick them up language now you [ __ ]
well now it's just like get on the
ground it's not even put your hands up
anymore no now they just shoot you
that's true they show up and start
shooting and then you're like I was just
speeding like four miles an hour over
the limit don't kill me yeah yeah well
congratulations man I mean yeah dog
that's uh it's it's exciting and the
audience knows cuz Monica's a Molly's
channel and stuff yeah so it's uh it's
it's a different like Parenthood is that
asks just a different world like it's
like as soon as you have that baby
you're just looked at as a different
person you know how how did you feel
from one moment to the next cuz like one
day you're not a parent and then the
next day all of a sudden you're a parent
yeah I mean it's still hitting me like
when I hold like my baby like it's it's
it still hits me that like even my I
sent my dad a couple pictures and he was
even like I can't believe you're a dad
like I was like yeah like I'm thinking
one like you're an [ __ ] why would you
say that
and then - I was like if he's right as
[ __ ] like how like how am i dead like so
it's just sort of like surreal you know
like it's it it's not really hitting me
totally yet because the baby is still
just like not anything that can
comprehend anything and like isn't it
isn't a person like yeah like until that
happens when there's talking yeah
exactly like when she's like like dad
what like what is this
so like asking questions then it'll be a
little stranger you know right now it's
just like I'm holding something that
that is very valuable it's like right I
can fine fine piece of China or some
[ __ ] yeah can't draw well I know with my
with my niece and my nephews it was
really bizarre to me watching them grow
because I like I remember when they were
just little mashed potatoes like just
these little people that would just sit
there and drool and [ __ ] on themselves
and like now they're talking and they're
playing sports and they go to school and
they work the iPad and like I remember
something was wrong with the TV one time
and we figured out I could have figured
out and my little nephew was like I'll
do that let me give me it and then press
a button or two and then at work and I
was like yep that's [ __ ] up yeah I
remember when you were not even existing
and then to think that my body has
changed so much to see like him grow
from being really little to now being
kind of big and talking and being smart
it's like well my body was growing that
whole time too like yeah so it's like
I'm not the same person I was in 2011 -
yeah and you don't think about that you
just look at the kid and it's like wow
he can talk and he can do all this [ __ ]
but it's like no you're grown exactly
yeah like now we don't even realize it
but like how many meals have I eaten
since then how many shits have I taken
since then out like how much has my hair
got in gray since then and it just keeps
marching on
yeah I don't know about you but I always
feel like I have moments of like I still
feel like I'm 16 basically like I say
yeah but like I always want to just like
pump the brakes a little bit and
whenever people around me are always
moving I'm always I'm always like damn
like just press pause for a little bit
like and that concept seems like it
shouldn't be hard like okay we're in
time and time moves forward but like you
almost feel like if you spend a day by
yourself in your room on the Internet or
some [ __ ] or you watch TV all day it's
like you feel like you kind of press
pause a little bit on life mm-hm but
you're not actually pressing pause like
time just keeps moving yeah and it's
creepy it's like whoa this is not it's
not stopping it's just keeping it just
doesn't stop yeah that's I mean I think
of that it's like your life is just like
a timeline like I look back obviously
when my daughter was born and then it's
like all right before that was my
wedding and it's just like you just have
these like events that happened that are
like monumental events and you like
people celebrate you in that moment so
you get texts and calls and all that
[ __ ] and it's just like all eyes are on
you and it's just like you go about your
business again well you know what's
interesting is I I kind of look at it
like that to almost like my life was in
different stages like there were
different chunks and it's like you know
for example your time in elementary
school like that's its own thing like
okay and and you take some memories from
that I remember we used to have field
day we just go play some [ __ ] and it was
fun
so--but and but like I almost feel
looking back like all the time was even
evenly split through each era and that's
just not true so for example there was a
time period when this was after my mom
and my dad had split up maybe five years
or so after that and then we moved out
of the house I grew up in and we moved
to my grandma's house we moved in with
my grandma for a little bit and my mom
and I did I should be clear and I
remember that timeframe now as if it was
almost equal in time to the time I spent
at my house growing up but I was only at
my grandma's house for like a year and a
half
mm-hmm and that I was at my you know
however many years I was amazed when we
ended up leaving the house I grew up in
but you look back on it and everything
is segmented into its own little thing
and it's just like an illusion that your
mind plays on you like no you were at
that place for a lot shorter time but
now you look back on it and that's like
its own era so you look at it as like
its own thing even though it's less time
yeah it's weird how it's like your mind
plays tricks on you too almost managed
your memories and your your time frame
and like what do you think that is you
think it's like do you want to remember
that memory is like longer than what it
was or it's just not particularly in
fact if anything is probably the
opposite I didn't want to leave the
house that I grew up in I didn't like
that idea in fact I despised that idea
it's interesting because you talked to
people whose parents got divorced and
one of the first things they'll tell you
is like they felt horrible about that
like damn did I do something did I [ __ ]
up I never had those feelings about my
mom and my dad it's all I was almost I
don't know if I was like emotionally
disconnected from it and I was doing
that as a matter of necessity or if
that's just kind of how I am Raj was
just looking at it like okay they're
human beings I don't get along anymore
so it makes sense how old were you how
old was I when they split I must have
been like 12 or 14 and then before you
could understand it a little bit they
divorced a few years later but no that's
the timeframe when people say like the
kids are most affected by it all right I
wasn't that I mean I don't think I was
affected by maybe if I went to a
psychologist or a psychiatrist and they
really dug deep they'd be like no you
actually did feel trauma over that four
and yadda-yadda manifested in this way
or that way I don't know but the point I
was gonna make is I felt like it had a
much bigger emotional impact on me when
we left the house I grew up in then
having my mom and dad split up my mom
and dad split up when I was still in the
house that I grew up in I was like okay
well I get that the date they had
troubles and they don't it's better for
everybody I kind of thought about it you
know but I think you're more tied to
memories in the house of [ __ ] that
you've done then like memories you have
with your pet like yeah
think about it yeah I think the
occasions with your parents and stuff
like that and do certain events but
you're not spending like most of the
time when you're 1314 you're spending
that time by yourself well I've always
been kind of like a loner you know what
I mean like an individualist where I'm
up there reading a [ __ ] Richard
Dawkins book as a young teenager and
they're doing whatever so yeah I think
in my mind it was like especially the
basement at that place it's like my safe
zone like I walk into it and it's like
that's it I'm safe I'm good here there's
my home notes yeah and then when you
pull that rug out from underneath me
then I was like this [ __ ] up man
but with the divorce I was like I get
[ __ ] happens
you know what I mean yeah yeah so it's
I'm weird like that with places but no I
didn't particularly feel like when I was
at my grandma's like I wanted it to last
longer in fact it was the opposite
definitely was probably weird but like I
see it definitely was taking you out of
your element of just being in the house
like cuz I had the same issue and it was
like yeah I had a issue too because me
and my sister moved to New Rochelle well
my brothers stayed back on my dad yeah
that separation of my like I feel like I
had more connection to my brother and
yeah that's big then I lost that with my
brother yep and [ __ ] it up a little
bit you know yeah that I feel like that
that that's big for sure because you and
your brother are close and then having
that it's like whoa yeah really feel the
split I wonder how much how how many
more kids who don't have siblings put
the blame on themselves
as opposed to like parents getting
divorced and and having a brother sister
to like go through that [ __ ] with yeah I
just I wonder how that affects every kid
cuz again I didn't feel like I'd had
that much of an impact on me but I know
that with a lot of people they read that
really shook them up and it's really
like holy [ __ ] you're breaking the
foundation of what made you know them
thrive but yeah it's I mean it's tough
man people are it's a difficult
situation people are complicated and
then that [ __ ] happens and then people
just have to try to deal with it and
pick up the pieces and move on and
that's life really yeah everyone's just
a [ __ ] human being and that's why
it's like I was texting someone and
who just had a newborn also and he was
like it's gonna it's gonna help you're
not that my relationship is bad but it's
gonna help your relationship by just
having like a stronger bond there but
then I guess at some point people
getting divorced that [ __ ] wears off
because it's there's a lot that goes
into it the baby is like up in the
middle of the night like crying and [ __ ]
like that and it's just like it's just
on you and your significant other to
[ __ ] shape this person and it's like
well and it's a full-time job man oh
hell yeah
it's not it's it's a very serious thing
and it's like it requires so much
attention and effort you know what I
mean it requires so much attention and
effort but it's just it's crazy how
anybody can just have a kid like you
know like it's just like it's wild to me
like you're in the hospital for two days
and then they're just like alright
you're you're you're on your own like
that isn't that doesn't that feel weird
like you're on your own like wait what
I'm responsible for a life now barely
take care of myself and I got to worry
about a little baby just like even
little things like the baby like an
infant stage like their head like rolls
around and it's just like God hold their
head because they don't well it's funny
you say that because I'm I'm like I'm
like infamous for not knowing how to
hold a baby it's almost like a running
joke within my family where they'll like
I've tried to hold the kids when they
were babies I mean I just it's like I
have zero paternal instinct yeah I'm
like I'm like holding the baby like it's
strange because it's and you know what
it is like I feel like on some level I
wanna make sure I do it right and the
fact that I'm so obsessed we're doing it
right [ __ ] me up more yeah like I [ __ ]
it up more because I start and then one
time my brother-in-law was like dude
like the babies and we're talking about
when I don't know how old they were
maybe 10 months at that point or some
[ __ ] and my brother-in-law was like like
dude he's gonna he knows how to balance
himself so it's almost like you just got
to provide a little bit of something for
them to sit on and then he's got like
his back is not jello like he's not
gonna sit on your back
their [ __ ] head does that [ __ ] well
that's that again well that's cuz your
baby's so young at this point but when
they're 10 months they can sit up so
like you just got to hold them a little
bit and then they got it like they look
at you like I got this [ __ ] yeah so but
we I don't know it's it's it's it it's
crazy to [ __ ] just put it all
together like back to that original
point like my dad's saying like I don't
know how your dad like I don't I don't
know how anyone's a dad like guys guys
are just guys you know and it's like
we're not supposed to know how to hold
the baby you know do all that [ __ ]
that's for woman's like instincts we
just don't know what the [ __ ] we're
doing at least you're speaking for
myself I'm sure there are some dudes who
might have some sort of natural instinct
on that front but I have zero of it and
you know I don't know how much of that
can be attributed to the fact that I'm a
dude or how much that could be
attributed to the fact of when I was
raised I more on the typical boys [ __ ]
like I like video games and [ __ ]
action figures and playing sports and
[ __ ] like I just never developed that
kind of although we're back in the day
hoe mech yeah that was the [ __ ] kook
yeah it was fun like I enjoyed home act
like but I still don't know how to cook
like almost anything it was a class that
like people [ __ ] it on but meanwhile
that's like a pretty important class
practicals [ __ ] practical joke man
absolutely if you do everybody had to
take a class on how to balance their
checkbook and all that stuff it
definitely would help a lot I mean
school should be a mix of learning the
practical knowledge for the real world
like that [ __ ] that we're talking about
and then also you mix it in with a
traditional education where you learn
how to think you know what I mean like
you learn philosophy and [ __ ] like that
they should mix it where it's a little
bit of both but you're right that they
don't like they very rarely do that kind
of [ __ ] nowadays but speaking of food I
am and we should actually jump into
these polls before I get into the flow
yeah in fact I will say though watching
I watched the baby be born and like
watching a baby coming to the world was
that that was pretty [ __ ] incredible
like my wife asked me because she was
like what did you think like what was
that moment like and I was like like cuz
people hype that [ __ ] up and that but
like in that one moment just seeing no
baby - baby was pretty
it was pretty it's pretty awesome I
don't I honestly don't know how women do
it because I did that I mean I forget in
some comedy movie from like the 90s a
woman explains it is like trying to
squeeze something the size of a
watermelon out of something the size of
a lemon yeah it's like how the [ __ ] did
the physics doesn't work no like how the
even taking like a massive dump like
when you when you finish that dump it's
still like something you can look at no
but it is you can look at it and be like
okay I could see how that came out
but like you've never taken a dump the
size of a baby that's not no and then
the fact that it literally is a baby
like you gave birth in it like it wasn't
just the body that came through
there's intestines and a brain and
eyeballs everything had to come out of
there like something something with
genitals came out of your genitals mine
[ __ ] over here we still aren't convinced
that the baby is ours cuz like that [ __ ]
right now it does not look anything like
either of us like I don't try too much I
saw one picture and I won't think that's
Correns face all really 100% and my mom
said the same [ __ ] my mom was like
that's Koren okay alright that's good to
know hunters on it alright cuz she's got
like strawberry red hair and I had red
hair as a child too but I got blonde
hair I was like real a tanam blonde as a
kid yeah for a while - it went away when
I was like I don't know four but your
dad had blonde hair right or there was a
trait somewhere right no my dad when he
was older did the Trump trick there's a
light guy trick where you dye your hair
blonde and that makes it look almost
like your hair is transitioning from
brown to white but it's stuck in a
blonde phase [ __ ] I think I remember
looking at him I was like okay his [ __ ]
is okay yeah like that's that's the old
white man trick if you die there blonde
a certain shade of blonde it can look
like you're not actually dying it holy
[ __ ] yeah yeah that's a good s trick
sorry I'm getting a random [ __ ] phone
call which I'm it's a 1-800 number
calling during the podcast that's ooh
there's those [ __ ] scams are it's
like savvy now they put your area code
on the [ __ ]
oh yeah yeah I don't I literally don't
answer my phone unless I know who it is
same I've become that person to it and I
was this close to doing that [ __ ] with
email to where I was like I almost want
to deactivate my email I can't because I
need yeah but like I was this close to
just like why I do that with my phone
I'd literally don't answer anything I
don't know so why wouldn't I like I got
a [ __ ] scroll through 30% ads 20%
[ __ ] I don't know what the [ __ ] it is
only that some [ __ ] which I'm supposed
to get but isn't even really that
important you know it's just like a
waste of time it is it's just a waste
time anyway was I saying about the hair
I was saying my dad [ __ ] was blond oh my
hair was blond yeah um yeah I guess um
yeah nobody in my family really had
blond hair that I know when they were
oldest yeah you know but that's
something like I see with my nephew now
too
he had blond hair when he was younger oh
really and my niece too but now it's
becoming more brown it's weird how that
works
it is super strange cuz we don't have a
blonde trade anywhere and it's like a
blonde strawberry blonde dish
it'll it's gonna be my mom it's gonna
become like yours yeah
so here we go again with Russia gate
being pushed on everybody I have a new
article here and I'm gonna break it down
for you and what I would do is I just
want everybody to keep an open mind as
we go through all of this information
because you know I do that when I read
through all these articles on Russia
and this Russia gate stuff I never go
into reading the articles like I'm gonna
come out proving the point that I
already believed no I go into it with an
open mind and I read it and I adjust my
opinion accordingly you know I thought
and everybody knows this that early on
when Muller was doing the you know the
investigation where it was mainly
focused on treason and Trump being
Putin's puppet I thought this is a waste
of time this is ridiculous
but then you know however long into
maybe a month into his investigation or
something there was an article in
Bloomberg or Reuters I don't remember
where they said oh no now Muller has
expanded the investigation and now it's
about Trump's finances and so it's about
financial crimes and and potential
money-laundering and that's when I did a
segment and I said oh [ __ ] now this
investigation is serious and now it's
something I totally support so in other
words I'm making the point that you have
to be open-minded when you read this
stuff and just go where the evidence
takes you and then that's how I come to
my conclusions so having said that now
let's go through this article and we'll
see what's true and what's false so look
at this NBC News tweeted breaking US
official in charge of protecting
American elections from hacking tells
NBC News that Russians successfully
penetrated voter registration rolls of
several US states prior to 2016 election
Wow
now before we continue I want to ask
everybody a question what what's your
interpretation of that when you first
read it just the title and what's the
implication the heavy implication of the
title I'll tell you what my takeaway is
I read that and I go oh [ __ ] they're
trying to make the case that Russia
Act or election where they're flipping
votes like they flipped votes maybe in
the Rust Belt where it was for Hillary
and they flipped it to Trump that's how
I that when I read that that's what my
takeaway is like oh [ __ ]
see Russia hack the election and now
it's proven I'm gonna read it one more
time so everybody knows breaking US
official in charge of protecting
American elections from hacking tells
NBC News that Russians successfully
penetrated voter registration rolls of
several US states prior to 2016
presidential election so the implication
the taste in my mouth as I read that as
they're saying they literally hack the
election and did stuff with votes that's
how I read that now understand the
overwhelming majority of people only
read the headline and in this case the
tweet only read the tweet and they go ah
see
so Russia gate I can't believe some
people are saying rush gate isn't real
look proven it's proven i-i've seen
headlines like that from people I
respect but proven proven is proven
Russia hacked our election and the
voters and the voting okay so let's go
directly to the article and see what
they actually say in the article quote
the US official in charge of protecting
American elections from hacking says the
Russians successfully penetrated the
voter registration rolls of several US
states prior to the 2016 presidential
election in an exclusive interview with
NBC News
Genet mantra the head of cybersecurity
of the Department of Homeland Security
said she couldn't talk about classified
information publicly but in 2016 quote
we saw a targeting of 21 states and an
exceptionally small number of them were
actually successfully penetrated jeh
Johnson who was DHS secretary during the
Russian intrusion said quote 2016 was a
wake-up call and now it's incumbent upon
States and the feds to do something
about it before our democracy is a
again we were able to determine that the
scanning and probing of voter
registration databases was coming from
the Russian government NBC News reported
in September 2016
that more than 20 states had been
targeted by the Russians there is no
evidence that any of the registration
rolls were altered in any fashion
according to US officials let me repeat
that there is no evidence that any of
the registration rolls were altered in
any fashion according to US officials so
the giant implication of the headline
and the giant implication of the first
few paragraphs just gets washed away
halfway through the article so oh my god
this thing happened watch out and then
you read read reading they go by the way
there's no evidence that any
registration rolls were altered in any
way so what the [ __ ] with the headline
and what the [ __ ] with the hair on fire
in the first few portions of the article
there's no evidence but of adheres to
all the things that we think maybe kind
of sort of didn't really it all happened
[Music]
listen guys
this reminds me quite a bit of the lead
up to the Iraq war
now you could again you could say that's
hyperbolic but you're just wrong because
that's if you go back and read oh my god
Saddam Hussein 9/11 Saddam Hussein 9/11
Saddam Hussein 9/11 Saddam Hussein work
with Al Qaeda's and I'm losing on a
yellow cake yellow cake at BU and yellow
cake buried in paragraph like 12 anyway
there's no direct evidence that shows
that any of this actually happened so
then why the [ __ ] are you what are you
doing what are you doing you need to
understand this is the deep state
leaking [ __ ]
to the press and using them as puppets
like we're being propagandized right now
there's an attempt to ramp up with
Russia and that's why you see all these
headlines and that's why you get all
these misleading articles and these head
fakes and [ __ ] okay so they go on in the
article to say this quote NBC News
reached out to the 21 states that were
targeted five states including Texas and
California said they were never attacked
so this is just again this is just like
the remember when they said 17 agencies
have concluded that brush out a
collection was total [ __ ] later on
it came out they included like the
[ __ ] Coast Guard in there what that's
the old Dick Cheney trick I had this
memo from the from the Department of
Justice and they say torture is okay
well what did Dick Cheney do he just
went and spoke to a low-level person at
the Department of Justice said just sign
this thing here and the governor right
here and then the Department of Justice
says you know he would do this with the
media he would leak Dick Cheney would
leak to the New York Times Saddam
Hussein weapons of mass destruction
that's what he has and then they'd run a
big front page think Saddam Hussein
weapons of mass destruction and then
Dick Cheney would go on Meet the Press
and go even the New York Times says said
I'm saying weapons of mass destruction
now we're doing the same thing 21 states
voter rolls hacked by the Russians and
then you read on they go Oh quote there
is no evidence of any of the
registration rolls being altered in any
fashion and then you read on when the
media contacted five of the states they
included on the list they were like what
are you talking about
I mean have any issue whatsoever know
what you're talking about they continued
following initial publication of this
article the National Association of
secretaries of state which represents
top electoral officials around the
country said it was quote still only
aware of one state voter registration
system that was penetrated are you
[ __ ] kidding me so we went from I'm
gonna read you the headline one more
time breaking US official in charge of
protecting American elections from
hacking tells NBC News that Russians
successfully penetrated voter
registration rolls of several US states
prior to 2016 presidential election
oh [ __ ] hair on fire everybody flip out
buried in the article quote there is no
evidence that any of the registration
rules were altered in any fashion and
then you read on the 21 states becomes
one state now this is where people who
are still heavily propagandized might
say yeah but Kyle you know hey man even
if it was one state well I mean what
you're pooh-poohing the fact that the
Russians got into the voter registration
rolls of one state how I don't
understand why you would downplay that
that's terrible that obviously needs to
be stopped
well I agree with you you know how you
stop that increase your defense that's
what most what you do and by the way
that the federal government didn't do
that so okay increase your cyber defense
problem solved
that's right this so this is a non-story
but it's actually worse than that
because we don't even what does that
even really mean oh the Russians and the
voter registration rolls are the
Russians Russian okay well you do know
we have congressional testimony over
this right so we have a department of
homeland security official who testified
in front of Congress and was asked all
these questions let's see how he would
describe what happened here and if it's
a big deal or not when when you
characterize these things as attacks I
think that that is perhaps overstating
what may have happened in the in the 21
States as was mentioned over the course
of the summer the majority of the
activity was simple scanning scan
happens all the time it's happening
right now to a number of probably your
websites as scanning is a regular
activity across the web I would not
characterize that as a as an attack it's
a preparatory step in terms of those
scripts there are two scripts one script
was provided to states that wanted
additional information if they were
included in that batch of 21 there you
go there you go I mean the it's amazing
how so this story which I just broke
down for you in full generates a
thousand headlines everybody flipping
out
if you've proven rush us one our
election that's how that's covered and
they go interference they interfered in
a political process that's not with
their own country hmm unreal
meanwhile we literally just covered a
story last week or two weeks ago Joe
Biden was at the Council on Foreign
Relations and he was given a speech he
was just casually talking and he said we
rigged the political system in Ukraine
he openly spoke about it I held a
billion dollars over their head and said
oh you want this money will you have to
fire this day prosecutor okay that is a
much much clearer example of meddling in
a foreign political system than any of
the accusations that have been leveled
against the Russians in regards to our
election and that got no coverage at all
not a single outlet covered that I that
had to be that was released by WikiLeaks
and nobody covered it nobody covered you
would think that if they it's a real
principled concern of people in the
media in the United States we don't want
anybody meddling in our political
process we don't want anybody meddling
in anybody's political process well for
[ __ ] sake Joe Biden was just bragging
about meddling and rigging a system in
Ukraine you didn't find that interesting
when you spent the last few months
talking about you're not allowed to
meddle in political process he's oh and
then not only that
you got Rex Tillerson casually floating
here maybe we're gonna go do a military
coup of Venezuela what now you don't
have to like the government of Venezuela
but they're not an imminent threat of
attack against us what Venezuela is
planning an attack against Nebraska is
that what's happening and we need to
defend our nation by toppling the
government no he's just like him maybe
whoa maybe we'll do a coup there and
topple the government you want to talk
about meddling in a political process
how about overthrowing other [ __ ]
governments that have nothing to do with
us so it's just [ __ ] spare me with
the [ __ ] this is all it's become so
comical and so over-the-top and it's
almost like the less that's there the
more hyperbolic the headline is so I
just need everybody to understand what's
going on man and listen again because a
lot of people take what I say on this
issue and then they strawman me so let
me be crystal clear for the thousandth
time I support Robert Muller and his
investigation I like the fact that he
knocked off Manta fort and Flynn on
financial crimes and I think if he can
get anybody in that in the
administration including Trump on
financial crimes wonderful that's great
because he's certainly a corrupt ass
businessman and I'm not by any stretch
of the imagination giving him a pass for
his corruption of course not I give no
politicians a pass for their corruption
so by all means do your thing
Robert Muller but just reel it in with
the hysteria and the overreaching on
this Russia gate stuff because it's
[ __ ] tiresome and it's also dangerous
because like I've explained in detail
the Democrats are now resisting from the
right half the time the Democrats resist
without resisting at all they'll toe
Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia and
then they give you no policies that
they're in favor of in any realm okay
and then the other half the time it's
resisting Trump from the right where oh
my goodness you know Don you should
really be in Syria permanently well he
did do that now now he's in Syria
permanently I hope you're happy
Democrats and no Democrats are resisting
and saying you shouldn't [ __ ] be in
Syria they want him to be in Syria
because Syria is Putin's Ally so hey
you're standing up to Putin buy-in
definitely militarily occupying Syria
that's the position of the Democrats now
the Democrats want to arm rebels in
Ukraine now the Democrats are for a NATO
buildup on Russia's border so they want
Trump to be more and more hawkish to
prove that he's not Putin's puppet and
then Trump acts more and more hawkish
and nobody's resisting and saying hey
maybe stop escalating with another
[ __ ] nuclear power so that's what we
need to do we need to resist from the
left I want our troops off of NATO's
ball off of I want NATO troops off of
Russia's border I want to stop
permanently militarily occupying Syria I
don't want to arm rebels in Ukraine I
want to do peace talks with Russia I
guess I'm a Putin puppet so this is my
concern on this issue is that all you
have is hawkish cries from the Democrats
it's really sad again just a few days
ago maybe a week ago now Russia and us
had planes that almost collided over the
Black Sea if those planes go down what
happens what happens that's dangerous
isn't it so why the [ __ ] are our planes
by Russia's border in the Black Sea get
him out of there man not a single
Democrat would say that and and if Trump
did that it would immediately be spun as
see Putin's puppet you don't want a
permanently militarily occupy Syria
Putin's puppet you don't want to fly our
planes right by Russia's border Putin's
puppet so now we're in a position where
even if Trump does the right policies to
de-escalate that will be used as
evidence of him being Putin's puppet
[Music]
it's a dangerous time because when we
used to have the Cold War at least there
were voices that were fighting against
it in the political landscape in America
now we have this new cold war and the in
vogue thing to do is to resist by
calling for a faster escalation of the
Cold War
so no prominent voice in the national
political scene is going no stop go in
the other direction deescalate
very dangerous place to be in
Dave Weigel of the Washington Post said
something pretty interesting on Twitter
this was back on February 7th I want
everybody to take a look
asked Dems at retreat presser if they'll
run in 2018 on repealing the tax cuts
and Jobs Act answer not really
they'll quote restore balance Joe
Crowley who by the way is one of the top
corporate Democrats in the country and
Alexandria Ocasio Cortes is running
against Joe Crowley and she has a real
chance in the primary so please look her
up and support her if you can Joe
Crowley said quote Democrats are for
creating economic security for the
American people were not in favor of
putting the country further out of
balance so a different tone that ours
Republicans visa vie Obamacare excuse me
a different tone than Republicans visa
vie Obamacare we promise to repeal
Obamacare ended up being a bogus promise
but it won elections so look at what
he's saying there the Republicans when
they campaign you know what they do they
throw red meat at the feet of their base
non-stop yeah you know what we're gonna
do
we're kicking immigrants we don't like
immigrants yeah and the base is likely
oh yeah [ __ ] the immigrants bro woo
they're the problem with everything
we're not scapegoating woo so that's
what they do and they say Obamacare
we're gonna repeal Obamacare that's what
we're gonna do we're gonna reveal
replace it it's so terrible and you know
what they could point to when John
Boehner was Speaker the house they tried
to repeal Obamacare over 60 times what
what now compare that to the Democrats
even when the Democrats have the
overwhelming majority of the American
people with them they try once lose and
then take their ball and go home so for
example universal background checks
that's a policy that over 90% of
Americans support even a majority of
Republicans even a majority
of NRA members say yeah universal
background checks we're in favor of that
well guess what
the Republicans said no when the
Democrats proposed it and then what guys
what okay fine we're gonna go away now
no counter-argument no trying again no
doubling down or being aggressive in
their messaging that's this what the
Democrats do and now we're presented
with another clear opportunity is what
this is guys Donald Trump's tax bill
this Republican tax bill which is now
law you know what the approval rating
was it ranged there were obviously
different polls done on it sometimes the
approval rating was in the 20s the
highest one I saw was 33% that's how the
American people felt about this this tax
bill that's how they felt about it and
so Dave Weigel goes well I'll ask the
Democrats cuz the most obvious thing to
run on in the world are you gonna run on
repealing this tax bill and replacing it
with your own tax bill just like the
Obamacare strategy that the Republicans
had repeal and replace go hard every day
attacking this tax well are they gonna
do that nope
they say literally no we're for
restoring balance what does that mean
what does that even mean what does that
mean again I'm gonna I'm gonna bring up
the Adam Johnson quote because he says
this repeatedly and it's spot on
Democrats need to learn that nobody
shows up to a pep rally for a tie nobody
does that
can you imagine everybody to stand
around on a pep rally yeah what are we
gonna do we're gonna tie with the other
team nobody does that
they shall we're gonna crush them we're
gonna win that's what we're gonna do
but the Democrats entire message is well
yeah what I would like is maybe if we
had Tim bipartisanship in some
negotiation and some compromise and then
maybe we could have some balance and I
think that would be wonderful if we
could sit down at the table with these
people that we vehemently disagree with
and then meet them halfway which means
that we'll get legislation that we
halfway completely disagree with and I
think maybe that would be a good idea
you can't say the Republicans are
crazy in one breath and then in the next
breath say and that's why we should meet
them halfway because then what you're
arguing is it wouldn't it be great and
wouldn't it be ideal if all of our
legislation was half crazy that's your
argument but listen man
the Democrats are fundamentally weak and
there are many reasons for but one of
the reasons is because of their donors
so at the end of the day the Democratic
donors also want deregulation of Wall
Street the Democratic donors also want
their taxes cut just go back and look at
that clip of the billionaire who was on
MSNBC what's his name James Clube accor
something like that he was a billionaire
on MSNBC in one of the top donors to the
Democratic Party and he would tell Chuck
Schumer and Nancy Pelosi if you don't
stop with the anti rich stuff we're done
with you we're not gonna fund you
anymore to which I say good [ __ ] go
home we don't want you
I mean how [ __ ] arrogant you're
giving money to politicians and you're
saying I'm going to control you send the
the Democratic Party becomes the [ __ ]
James clew Beck party and not what's
it's supposed to be the party of the
people the party of workers but of
course Chuck and Nancy you're like yes
sir so that Bernie Sanders rhetoric you
know that Rho Conner rhetoric did you
sweep that under the rug shut the [ __ ]
up shut the [ __ ] up shut the [ __ ] up and
then that's why they go out there and
they're not saying they're not running
on a platform of yeah we're gonna get
rid of these gigantic tax cuts for the
rich of course we're gonna get rid of
these are you crazy
it cuts corporate taxes from 30 percent
to 21 percent at a time when
corporations are already paying a
historic low percentage of the tax
burden we're gonna get rid of it [ __ ]
massively slashes the estate tax the
estate tax is just a tax that applies to
people with [ __ ] estates it's like
the top point o 1% of society that's who
they decided to save money for 83% of
the benefits of this bill go to the top
one percent this bill raises taxes on
every American making $75,000 a year or
less over a 10-year period of course
we're going to get rid of
they don't say that why because their
donors also kind of like the bill that's
who loves this bill rich people so if
the Democrats are beholden to those rich
people it's controlled opposition so
that's why they go out there hey are you
gonna run on repealing this horrendous
tax bill that screws over working people
across this country no we're not we're
gonna restore balance what does that
even mean what does that mean you even
telling you man it's Milton it's the
stapler guy from [ __ ] office space oh
yeah we thank you mine I have my stapler
back I'd really appreciate could I
please have the government back I would
like to maybe win an election or two and
I think it would be wonderful if we did
that but you're not gonna get people to
vote for you if whenever you have power
you don't do the things that people want
anyway
and that's what happens the Democrats
had a super majority under Barack Obama
they didn't do single-payer when they
had a super majority they'd even get a
[ __ ] public option which is like the
most watered down version that would be
acceptable for a health care bill and
and honestly that even still wouldn't be
acceptable but it'd be better than
[ __ ] Obama care which is a formerly
right-wing bill I mean that's what that
was that Obamacare copied Romneycare in
Massachusetts Obamacare copied a
Heritage Foundation bill I mean that's
what an individual mandate system is
it's the original right-wing plan so
what if the Democrats have control and
they do Republican policies anyway then
the Democrats aren't going to win
because when the people are given an
option between Republican and Republican
light they're always going to pick the
Republican base they go at least that's
more authentic you have to run as
liberals run as progressives run as left
wingers on Apollo unapologetic left
wingers but they're not going to do that
so by the way we checked in on this
because I just gave you the Dave Weigel
tweets this was from February 7th a few
days later zyi Jelani of the intercept
said well let me follow up on this and
see what's going on maybe you know Dave
Woggle just spoke to one or two
Democrats and they said no we're not
gonna run on that but now maybe they saw
the headlines and they said hey maybe we
should actually run on repealing this
thing it already at best is 33% popular
so why wouldn't we run on that so zyi
Jelani followed up and what did he find
Democrats pessimistic on tax cut we've
got what we've got for the next thirty
years they have no fight in them they
have no fight in them you know I've
pointed this out before but I'm gonna
keep pointing it out because it's true
if the Democrats chose to run on
virtually any policy issue they would
win in a landslide in the next election
it wouldn't even be close it wouldn't
even can you imagine the enthusiasm how
quickly people would come out to vote
for Democrats if they for example said
our whole strategy for the 2018 midterms
is we're gonna get you a living wage
we're gonna get you a living wage and
we're going to tie it to inflation we're
gonna get a $15 minimum wage tied to
inflation that's what we're about and
then they their whole campaign was built
around that we support fight for 15 you
could point out the examples there are
states where Republicans literally
lowered the minimum wage they lowered it
I didn't hear a single word from a
national Democrat about that you could
run a campaign just on that and say we
win you want to know why 80% of
Americans are already with you 80% of
Americans want to raise the minimum wage
even most Republicans are with you
that's a clear winner of an issue you
could say these Republicans they despise
working people you want to raise minimum
wage they want to lower the minimum wage
they're so disconnected formality US
Democrats are gonna raise the minimum
wage to a living wage and tied to
inflation we're gonna help millions of
people across this country that's what
we're gonna do because if you work
full-time you should make enough money
to survive that's a position why are the
Republicans against the duh
did you know that the minimum wage is
actually worth less today than the
minimum wage was in 1968 did you know
that if the minimum wage kept pace with
inflation from 1968 it would be about 10
dollars and 75 cents or so today so now
it's 725 the minimum wage is worth
significantly less than it was in 1968
if the
wage kept up with productivity it'd be
about $20 an hour today if the minimum
wage kept pace with the wage growth of
the top 1% it'd be 21 dollars today
point out these things fight for these
things but they won't do it that's how
they'd win an election could you imagine
if every Democrat in the country got on
on on the page of we're gonna run on
legalizing taxing and regulating
marijuana and we're gonna attack the
issue from every angle we're gonna say
guess what this is gonna create hundreds
of thousands of jobs Republicans I guess
you're against creating hundreds of
thousands of jobs guess what this is
gonna do massive deficit reduction for
the respective states across the country
and for the federal government I guess
you know I guess the Republicans are
against collecting tax revenue and I
guess they're not fiscal Hawks and
fiscal conservatives and deficit hawks
because they want to keep the deficit
high by not legalizing marijuana
I guess the Republicans are against the
free market because all we want to do is
take this issue which by the way 60
percent of the American people agree
with they want to legalize marijuana all
we want to do is take that and give the
people what they want and create a free
and open marketplace where the party of
freedom that they're the party that's
against freedom call your Republican
politician and ask them why they hate
freedom if the Democrats ran on that
issue they'd crush if the Democrats all
ran on Medicare for all they'd crush if
the Democrats all ran on this tax bill
is a massive giveaway to the rich it
adds over a trillion dollars to the
deficit eighty three percent of the
benefits go to the top one percent it
raises taxes on everybody making $75,000
a year or less US Democrats are going to
raise taxes on Wall Street and cut your
taxes if you're a worker if the
Democrats all ran on that they'd win
instead they have no message they have
nothing they have nothing all you get is
Trump is bet you know what the new one
is they're the Democrats have been for
four days now they've been apoplectic
because there was a guy who worked in
Trump's administration in his cabinet
who it turns out there was information
that leaked about how he was an abuser
he did domestic violence against his
wife so what happened
Trump fired him now of course with Trump
there's a thousand gross things around
it like oh he defended him publicly and
he said he didn't do it and there's
clear evidence the guy did do it in
yadda yadda yadda but all you hear from
the media and all you hear from
Democrats is that story doctors a
wife-beater in his administration
bad bad people up so you're bad people
you know that you're bad people why are
you focusing on personality-driven drama
soap opera [ __ ] why are you making it
about personalities where they talk
about who the people are and everybody
knows their names and then you turn on
CNN and the banner has the person's name
in it and everything there's a single
mother in Kentucky right now who's
trying to pay the [ __ ] light bill and
put food on it she doesn't give a [ __ ]
about your shitty drama and always try
to think for a second if the story was
there it was flipped and it was
different from the partisan angle how
you'd feel about it if Bernie Sanders
became president and he happened to hire
somebody who was a domestic abuser and
then he he learned about that and went
oh [ __ ] that's [ __ ] up and then he
fired the guy we'd be over it in a
minute and a half all of us would be but
now there's some people the mainstream
media is [ __ ] themselves still four
days into it other media outlets online
are talking about that non-stop this is
this is all a distraction from policy if
all you're gonna do is clutch your
pearls and do the the soap opera drama
you're not going to win elections people
are gonna go why are you so unserious
Trump is an idiot but somehow you're
more unserious than he is at least
Donald Trump every day goes out there
and says something about Papa policy
even though he's a hundred percent wrong
and whatever the [ __ ] he talks jobs jobs
jobs the market something he'll say [ __ ]
like that I'll tweet about out terrible
immigrants are you don't hear anything
from the Democrats about health care
about jobs about the minimum wage you
don't hear anything foreign policy
nothing they're not saying in the wars
if the Democrats ran on a platform of
end the wars and reinvest that money
here at home in a giant infrastructure
bill that would win them an election
they don't have anything to say about
that so if all you're hearing from the
Democrats is oh my god mean people bad
people in the administration and isn't
Russia terrible
Russia Russia Russia well then you're
gonna lose the election or at the very
least you're gonna have mixed results in
an election that could easily be a
landslide for you so this is the problem
this is the problem
the Democrats are defeatists they're
their corporate US also and they have no
fight in them they have no fight in them
they're not I mean seriously
they're asked point-blank are you gonna
run against this super unpopular tax
bill they go no we believe in balance
and compromise literally the worst
argument you can make that's what that
is because we have all the evidence the
Democrats we just had 8 years of Barack
Obama and that Democratic Party you know
what that Democratic party was that
Democratic Party did the exact same
thing that you're arguing for here
balance and compromise and negotiation
and we'll work with Republicans that's
what they were all about and what
happened you lost a thousand seats now
compare that to the Tea Party I disagree
with virtually everything in tea parties
for policy-wise but all they did was
scream at the top of their lungs about
their policy issues and then they want
to know in a landslide so you have to
counter that by running on your issues
in a loud aggressive way but they're not
doing that they're barely discussing any
policy issues at all so it's pathetic
it's gross and listen guys all the the
sideshow stuff about how crazy this
administration is with all the [ __ ]
happening with the different
personalities that's all a distraction
that's all a distraction and a diversion
from focusing on the things that would
win the Democrats in election
this year tyt's been making a lot of
moves now you can too
now how you're going to do that you want
to launch a new business that sounds fun
you're going to change careers jesus
lord mercy you're going to need a
website for all that
lucky for you squarespace also making
moves you're going to go to
squarespace.com tyt
you're going to get 10 off your first
purchase and you're going to get to
build
anything you want on that website with a
unique domain
what are you crazy go do it now go
welcome to tyt interviews we're going to
do a
unique one today we are going to have
someone else from the tyt network on
to discuss one issue in particular and
that
is russia
so if you remember you're watching this
live everybody else it'll go up for you
soon and you'll get to watch it
uh for yourself as well but that's
this is when you would be watching it
because you're not watching live okay
anyway
we go to kyle kalinski from secular talk
and he's going to join us on this issue
um i
i brought kyle on because he's a
reasonable dude i fancy myself a
reasonable dude
and uh we ostensibly have a disagreement
on russia
i think it's a big deal uh i'm going to
characterize his position as not a big
deal
but luckily he's here and can speak for
himself and what we're going to try to
do first is find points of agreement
which i suspect will be plentiful and
then boil down to our disagreement on
russia
and then figure out why we uh each have
the position that we do
so uh kyle first can i get you to agree
that that was an excellent super bowl
um yes although i do have to add the
caveat that
i'm one of about 17 guys in america that
doesn't care at all about football
okay uh i think that i rest my case and
i will see all of you guys later
all right score one for me as we move
forward all right no seriously
uh and and i want to be clear this is
just a discussion so
um now i will say that i think that
russia
is a quote unquote big deal because um
i believe that trump did far worse than
helping the russians meddle in our
elections i believe that he did
money laundering and i think uh that he
owes the russians
and and is paying them back and i think
it is
a wildly dangerous situation for our
democracy
okay so what part of that if any do you
agree with
uh and what part do you disagree with so
i agree that uh trump probably did money
laundering
um i think he did money laundering
not just with russia i'm convinced he
did it
with other actors as well i think he's
colluded with other governments perhaps
in an even more
clear way than he's colluded with the
russian government if he's indeed
colluded with the russian government at
all
um you know when we talk about this
issue of russiagate i think there's
it's actually a very complicated issue
because there's many different moving
parts to it
so the first question is and you just
touched on it what is trump guilty of
um i would say that he's probably guilty
of money laundering
uh i think he's guilty of collusion with
turkey saudi arabia and israel
and um i also think he's guilty of uh
other financial crimes with uh there's
evidence he's done it with the mafia
he's
there's evidence he's done it with big
banks and
and wall street firms so generally
speaking i'd say i support
what robert mueller is doing but i
support what robert mueller is doing
because i think he can basically take
out one by one trump's cabinet
on crimes like that so for example what
he's already done with flynn what he's
already done with manafort
like i support that stuff and there's a
a lot of evidence
of the guilt of various actors in uh
trump's administration
but i just think that the idea of trump
being
putin's puppet or trump doing treason is
basically a liberal pipe dream that's
equivalent to
democratic benghazi because you're never
going to get trump on treason you're
never going to get trump on being
putin's puppet
nor do i actually think he is those
things so i think that's the crux of our
disagreement
all right so um now let me agree back
with you first on a couple of issues
um i think that it is curious that we
don't talk about
donald trump's collusion with saudi
arabia turkey and some of the other
countries that you mentioned
now i get why because there is no
allegations that saudi arabia
mess with the vote on the other hand
donald trump has very clear financial
interest in saudi arabia
and seems to have changed our policy
to suit saudi arabia which is deeply
problematic
and an argument could be made for israel
and certainly turkey as well
so um does the media care less about
that
because saudi arabia turkey israel etc
are essentially our allies
and and it's uncomfortable to talk about
that
and are they demagoguing russia because
it's easier yes
so i agree with you on that um and is
the democratic party
using russia meddling in the elections
as an excuse for their loss to donald
trump
yes i agree with you on that no question
about that
now and i think there was a lot of
different factors involved
now but if you think that donald trump
has done the money laundering as i do
and apparently
you do to some extent isn't that kind of
a big deal
uh to oh sure should paraphrase biden
no abs i think it is i think all all the
financial stuff that you can get him on
of course it's a big deal
it's a big deal in the same way that you
know people like us went after hillary
clinton for the clinton foundation
and the fact that she took a tremendous
amount of money from saudi arabia
and all these very repressive
governments and then she did their
bidding
and helped them through policy you know
by the same token
when you look at what trump's done just
to give people a specific exchange
because i'm not sure that they know
i'm not sure people know a lot about the
saudi arabia thing or the turkey thing
or the israel thing because again the
media doesn't discuss it
but you know in those instances like
trump registered
eight new businesses in saudi arabia
when he was on the campaign trail
he also took 270 thousand dollars
from top saudi officials for them to
stay at his hotel
not because they actually needed to
spend 270 000
that was a bribe and they were paid back
because trump gave them a 350 billion
dollar weapons deal
and then by the way they took those
weapons and turned around and they're
literally committing a genocide in yemen
right now and i don't use that word
lightly i think that's the right word to
use
for what saudi arabia is doing in yemen
with the weapons that we gave them
so i think there's a clear connection
there and i would love it if
if mueller gets him on anything i think
it'd be great
um but i think the thing that frustrates
me
is um they're focusing on the flimsier
case
the case of russia and the reason why
they're doing that is because
there there are hawkish goals here and
these are the same hawkish goals
that have been in place for a very long
time i'm going to use the dirty word
here but the deep state
has always been standoffish against
russia we've expanded nato towards their
border
when we promised that we wouldn't do
that and now
because we're so obsessed with trump's
connection with russia
you find a lot of overtly hawkish
rhetoric coming from
democrats and i know that they view it
as like they're resisting trump and
they're being strong
on trump but the reality is when you
have rachel maddow for example
arguing that if trump removes
nato troops from russia's border that
somehow proves
that putin has the peepee tape and
therefore he's putin's puppet and
therefore
donald trump should keep nato troops on
put
on russia's border i don't agree with
that and in fact i think that's
rachel maddow being like very neocon
hawkish
and flirting with world war iii because
of how she's choosing to resist trump
on the russia issue so if they wanted to
resist trump just on the financial
crimes angle
we wouldn't even be having this
conversation because i'm totally on
board with that
in fact i think i'm even stronger on
that issue because i could point out
the thousand ways he's done the corrupt
deals and he's done the collusion with
other foreign governments i mean to give
the example of turkey
michael flynn took 500 000 from the
turkish government
then michael flynn pushes the u.s
government to not arm the kurds who were
fighting isis
so that's direct money from the turkish
government and then we did something
directly to benefit the turkish
government there's your collusion right
there
that's been proven but nobody talks
about it nobody cares
because that's not the real concern of
the people who are yelping about this
the real concern is let's move to the
right on foreign policy and let's be
hawkish
and escalate with russia so
let alone flynn's deal where they were
planning to
kidnap someone from america and
deliver him to erdogan which is just
insanity
now look people will say and rightfully
so that's flynn
we don't have any evidence nor do i even
suspect that trump authorized that
now trump does have business dealings in
turkey so
i wouldn't put it past them and be happy
to do that investigation but there isn't
very much evidence of that
but there's overwhelming evidence
against flynn and hence the
plea deal that he took now on the
hawkishness
look i don't want to be hawkish towards
russia um i also don't want to be naive
towards russia i don't think that they
have our best interests
sometimes i see progressives who are
like oh my god no
putin and russia could be our allies
putin is basically a dictator and if
you're a progressive you should have no
interest in defending
vladimir putin who has been against
democracy in russia
let alone ukraine and other places so
this whole thing of like
no poor putin has been uh
you know put upon by the west i'm not
buying that
i'm not interested in dictators anywhere
including russia
um but just because i don't want to be
hawkish towards
russia doesn't mean that we should not
investigate
things that trump might have done with
russia i think that i could have the
position of
no i don't wish to go to war with russia
and i also don't wish to let them get
away with whatever deal that they have
with our president that makes sense
absolutely if that was where it ended
again we wouldn't be having this
conversation but
i think the problem is the consequences
not just
from the position that you're taking
right now
but the effects that this has had on the
broader political
scene so you know just to give a few
examples
democrats are now in favor of arming
rebels in ukraine and those rebels are
very unsavory characters including
there's been some reporting on how there
are neo-nazi
rebels in ukraine who are anti-russia
and so
the idea is well you arm them and you
have a standoff over the crimea thing
so that's not again you can be
like i wouldn't say i'm anywhere near
pro-putin he of course i agree with you
he's an authoritarian menace
but he's a threat to his own people and
i don't think
and then the people of ukraine and the
people of
georgia and potentially people of
estonia
okay so then this gets into a bigger
issue then what exactly should our
policies be towards russia on that front
and you know i've tried to make clear to
my audience all along every time i talk
about this issue
where i stand on those policy issues so
you know for example the exxon deal
i'm against the exxon deal i think if
trump ends up approving that yes that
sign of
corruption and cutting a deal but i'm
for the sanctions over crimea
tentatively because again you have to
take into account nato's history of
expanding towards russia's border
which they view as aggression but i'm
not in favor of for example
the uh sanctions the new round of
sanctions over the
uh so-called election meddling because
number one the intelligence agencies
presented zero evidence for that and
these are the same people who said
that uh saddam did 9 11 and so we need
to do the iraq war
and number two they we're acting like
there are no consequences we keep
escalating with them and keep hitting
them with
sanctions on top of sanctions on top of
sanctions arming rebels that are on
their border
and then we expect like oh that he's
just gonna like fall back in his place
no he's a nuclear-armed power
and this is why this is a dangerous game
that we're playing
yeah so i look if you say to me
um i don't want to get into a dangerous
game with russia and
arming unsavory characters in ukraine
i'm going to agree with you
mainly because whenever we go to arm
unsavory characters
we don't have a great track record on
that i remember
a guy we armed back in afghanistan that
was fighting the russians at the time
his name was osama bin laden
oops right right so i'm
against that kind of interventionism on
the other hand
estonia is now whether it was right to
do in the first place or not
is part of nato so if russia goes into
estonia
it's incredibly important that we
protect estonia otherwise our treaties
don't mean anything
so so then you would potentially do
world war three to protect you
then i told you you lose me on that
world war three is really hyperbolic
super hyperbolic so like whenever like
sometimes some
folks on the left you like get into a
situation
of what should we do about russia
sanctions not sanctions et cetera
boom world war iii card right so so
you can do things about his incursion
into georgia
ukraine and estonia short of launching
nukes
well right but again if we're if we're
what we're doing right now is we have a
nato buildup on his border
and that's like if russian troops
all of a sudden were right on the border
of mexico every single politician in the
u.s would say
get the guns ready it's time to fight
back but for some reason when we put
nato troops directly on his border
that's viewed as like oh my god if
you're against that you're a putin
puppet
and that's no no i don't think you're a
putin person i don't think anybody's a
putin puppet
in that regard but um but and if you say
hey maybe we should
have estonia latvia et cetera withdraw
from nato that's a
interesting argument but
but it's a different thing to not defend
estonia if they are part of nato
well let me just say i'm i'll just go on
the record now and say i
i would not uh send u.s
troops to fight to protect estonia and
you could say that means i'm weak on
russia or whatever the case is
sorry but i don't think yes potentially
risking i'm not saying it would lead to
world war iii but if we get into some
sort of a hot war
over estonia i don't think it's worth it
to send you know
men and women from kentucky who never
heard of estonia until three and a half
minutes ago to maybe fight and die to
protect them
um so and again this all goes really
back to the issue of nato and
uh who's really at fault here like again
i said i'm tentatively for the
sanctions on over the crimea thing and
the reason i say that is because
we lied to russia when the soviet union
was broken up we said listen we're not
going to move an inch towards your
border and then we kept moving towards
their border that's a provocative action
that's an aggressive action
and that's not something we would
tolerate from them look at what happened
when they put
missiles in cuba and pointed them at us
we said oh [ __ ]
we're going to war so the fact that we
have them in that position right now
again i'm just trying to get people to
see this from both sides and that
doesn't mean that putin's a good guy
he's a menace against his own people
but i don't think he's a threat in the
same way uh that people are being
so Joe Biden is a very mixed character
in my opinion he sat down for an
interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo and
you're about to see classic Biden which
is gigantic downsides but also the
occasional upsides just so everybody
knows he's likely gonna run in 2020 and
we're gonna see he's gonna give us here
some clues some hints as to what his
strategy would be going into a 2020
election
so first let's see the mumbo-jumbo angle
and the part where it looks like he
doesn't know what he's doing are we
heading down a very bad road or do you
think this all ends well look when I
when the president first got elected I
got heavily criticized for saying I hope
he succeeds because America succeeds and
the president succeeds and I found
myself first first bemused thinking that
maybe these were just over the top gas
that we're going on but now I've gone
from that to I'm genuinely concerned
there's two things that have popped up
first one is that on this business this
this naked nationalism that it's now us
against them as Richard Haass says
there's three ways countries lose their
ability to influence the world and lose
their power and one of them which is
advocating that power we're advocating
our responsibility around the world and
putting everything in terms of us versus
them the second thing that combines with
that is this phony populism this notion
that the way in which that you the only
reason you have a problem is because of
the other it's because of that immigrant
or that minority or because of someone
else doing something to you
and so this president spent his entire
time since he's gotten an office trying
to divide the country study unite the
country and as I said it we I am more
optimistic about the chances for America
in the 21st century than I have been in
my whole career we have the most
advanced universities in the world where
all the research comes out oh we have
the most productive people
world where have the most agile venture
capitalists we're in a situation where
we're energy independent North America I
mean what are we doing we're not talking
about any of the things that really
matter and all he seems to be trying to
do is undo everything President Obama
has done but he's not able to do that by
the way why not well because if you see
what happens you have he's tried to get
he's damaged health care but it's not
gone
he has gone after the Paris Accord but
you see mayors and governors and local
leaders getting together and making sure
that doesn't have the effect that he
intended it to be you find us in a
situation where you know there are
millions of people still have as I said
health care and preventive care you find
ourselves in position where the
education system it's actually getting
better and better so that was a poor job
and I'm gonna break it down for you and
explain why it's a poor job because the
message is it's all over the place it's
just garbled up if garbled is a word I
may have just made it up but if I did
make it up man that's a great word
garbled bar gold bar bar belt whatever
you got the point
he's just mumbo-jumbo he's all over the
place so he goes first he starts
attacking Trump he's like ah man
nationalism as nationalism is bad then
he goes to well you know the other
problem is the u.s. is abdicating power
around the world what so for those who
don't know Trump's bombing 8 different
countries number one that's not a good
thing number two that is certainly not
abdicating power around the world you
know people like Biden and establishment
types were upset with Trump when he was
on the campaign trail not because they
thought this guy's a lunatic who's gonna
start blowing up everything in sight and
starting unnecessary wars but because
they thought he might not do that
because half the time he did non
interventionist rhetoric on the campaign
trail and said let's get out of
Afghanistan and let's rebuild here at
home now he didn't end up acting on that
stuff but I wish he did act on that
stuff Joe Biden is upset because oh no
America seems to be abdicating power how
Joe how we're bombing a different
countries how we still have 900
military bases around the world how so
then he moves on to his phony populism
there's phony populism going on here
stop you know the Democrats need to stop
attacking the idea of populism and
there's also doesn't seem to be a clear
definition that everybody's getting on
board with for populism so he seemed to
indicate that populism is bigotry no
populism is doing the appealing to what
average people want doing that which is
popular among average people so stop
stop smearing that word understand that
the populist angle of Trump's campaign
was oh I'm not going to outsource your
jobs I'm against NAFTA I'm against TPP
so that was the populist angle of
Trump's campaign it not
man I hate immigrants so when he starts
attacking populism but I think most
people intuitively understand the
populism means you know look doing what
the average Joe wants then that's not
you're not that's not kind of land
that's not a message that's gonna land
so the when he goes after Trump he goes
after Trump for nationalism abdicating
power which is a terrible idea to go
after him for if you want to go after
him you should go after him for not
abdicating power in other words not
withdrawing US troops from around the
world that would be a more powerful
message because people want to stop
wasting money and all these dumb Wars he
goes after him for populism and he goes
after him for bigotry then you get to
and this is why the message is so
confused he goes I'm optimistic about
America wait what you just went through
a million reasons why you're like God
things are so bad and then he pivots to
a domme optimistic what what you can't
say I'm gonna attack this guy who's
president now because he's doing so many
fucked-up things and then also say but
I'm optimistic which is it either you're
like holy things are really bad
look at this guy in here or you're like
oh I'm optimistic about the country he
tries to have it both ways and then he
he references venture capitalists come
on Joe Kahn Joe really as if you know
Rhett a regular person is sitting on
their couch in
in the state of Washington going yeah
you know we do have some great venture
capitalists don't we know they're like
 you venture capitalists it's
because that's the circles he runs in
middle-class Joe is now is now wealthy
ass Joe that was not catchy enough well
you get the point and then he goes on to
say well we and we got the best schools
hey maybe you should be focusing on the
student loan debt crisis for example or
the fact that you know people are still
paying off student loan debt and they're
in their 50s and 60s that seems to be a
big problem to me but no you're bragging
about how great our schools are and then
finally the he does the the bragging
about Obama's half-measures Obama's
incrementalism the Democrats are not
going to win elections on half-measures
you're not going to win elections on
half-measures you're gonna win elections
on saying here's what I'm in favor of
and you guys already support these
things Medicare for all free college
living wage new New Deal legalizing
marijuana it's not an inspiring message
to go out there and say well you know
Obama did some good things that were
incrementalist and Trump is trying to
take him away but he's not totally
succeeding and taking him away what the
 is that what is that so at the same
time that he's lambasted trumping only
things are terrible he's other messages
America is already great just like
Hillary Clinton did and we know how that
message worked out people rolled their
 eyes you want to know why people
rolled their eyes cuz they're hurting
they're hurting Joe people are
struggling half of workers in America
make thirty thousand dollars a year or
less you pick one you either go holy
 things are up and we have to
fix them or you go America is already
great now what I would tell you is drop
the Americas are too great stick because
it's nonsense that's the old-school
political playbook Ronald Reagan won on
his sunshine and cheeriness it's not the
1980s anymore Joe
it's not the 1980s anymore you have to
run on a message of is up
and we got to fix it you want to know
why you have to run on that message cuz
 is up and we have to fix it
so
but this is the downside of Joe Biden if
he runs in 2020 and he runs a campaign
like this believe it or not he could
lose and I know I'll be like oh please
Kyle but everybody said every step of
the way Trump would never become
president he's president so I would hope
people have learned humility by this
point first they said he's never gonna
win a debate then he wanted to bait then
they said okay he's never gonna win the
second debate he won the second debate
then they said there's no way he's gonna
win a caucus he won a caucus then they
said there's nobody's gonna win a
primary he want a primary then they said
there's no way he's gonna get the
nomination he got the nomination then
they said there's no way he's gonna be
present he became president now people
are saying there's no way he's gonna get
reelected have some humility and
understand it is possible to lose to
this guy still despite all of his
ridiculous antics and nonsense and even
his shitty policies if the Democrats
have a message that can't even be
understood like this one things are
terrible but also I'm optimistic about
America is it which is it if they
do that they're in trouble that's shitty
Biden now let's see what Biden can be at
his best watch when you go to speak to
the Democrats now this is going to be a
big deal they have to figure out some
very fundamental things being anti-trump
probably won't be enough what is the
challenge for your party the challenge
is for us to step up and offer concrete
answers which we're doing for example
when we talk about you know the plight
of the of the working class well you
know one of the plates is the cost of
education the cost of daycare the cost
of being will care for your kid and
there's no reason in the world why we
can't step up and have continued
education that's free that we can't be
in a situation where look today one of
the reasons why we ended up the most
powerful nation of the world because of
our education system and the turn of the
20th century in New York and other
places I said they're going to be twelve
years of not means-tested free education
if we were doing that today Chris do you
think we do it for 12 years
No so if there's not enough not even
close everybody knows it so what the
hell are we doing the money on other
people's homes oh well no no well I see
I don't think that I think they think we
don't have the money to spend if you
eliminate it one single loophole call
stepped-up basis there's there's a
trillion three hundred and forty billion
dollars in loopholes out there for the
wealthy and for others if you're just
eliminated one that cost seventeen
billion dollars I could put every single
qualified kid in America who qualifies
into Community College for free for free
cutting the cost of four-year college in
half it cost six billion a year and I
can reduce the deficit by eleven billion
dollars because we're giving away
seventeen billion dollars a year in a
thing cost us so an idea like that is a
centrist idea you've said before the
Democrats have to think about how to get
to the center and speak to the people
that voted for President Trump your
party is not moving to the center mr.
vice president it's moving to the left
well Chris you know me well and I don't
want to I don't want to correct you my
point is I don't think you have to
choose between your heart and your soul
if you go back and look at my record of
36 years and seven I was ready to won
most liberal senators in the United
States Senate that 36 year period
I'm the guy that spoke out on same-sex
marriage and a whole range of other
things I take a back seat to no one to
being progressive I found no distinction
between being able to be progressive and
worrying about working-class people
thank you there you go and by the way to
his credit very few other Democrats
wouldn't know to respond like that most
people would immediately give in to
Chris Cuomo's framing where
Chris Cuomo is like hey you know in
order to be Trump you guys got to move
to the center that's what you gotta do
most Democrats being oh yeah totally
you're right we need to move the center
let's go to the center now that's what
most Democrats would do Joe Biden was
like man well here's the deal if your
progressive you're fighting for workers
I was one of the most liberal senators
and that's actually what makes me win
elections yes that's the answer
now listen overall I mean let's keep it
real about Joe Biden he's an
establishment Democrat he's at the very
least a half establishment Democrat
I think he's maybe a little more to the
left than Obama but he's probably not
even as far left is Elizabeth Warren and
Elizabeth Warren has quite a bit of
establishment in her so I'm not saying
he's you know
he's some sort of populist left hero
he's not but I'm just saying that his
rhetoric there is winning rhetoric that
rhetoric right there is winning rhetoric
so he says oh what do you do to win and
Joe Biden basically says free college
there's an issue right there why
wouldn't we do free college and all you
have to do is eliminate one tax loophole
for the ultra rich and then you could
pay for free college thank you Joe that
is that's true that's a winning message
the US Democrats are for a free college
the Republicans are not for free college
they're for protecting tax loopholes for
the ultra rich so whose side are you on
America you want to be with the people
who are fighting for the mega-rich to
continue to hide their money in the
Cayman Islands and Barbados or
you want to be with us who are saying no
we're gonna close that loophole and give
your kid college for free that's a
no-brainer that's a no-brainer
and again Chris Cuomo they're totally
spewing the establishment
wisdom of well you know obviously since
the Donald Trump is a Republican and so
in order for the Democrats to win they
need to move more towards the
Republicans and be more centrist do you
like my hard core logic no I don't eat
it because that's exactly what Hillary
Clinton did Hillary Clinton's whole
message was oh look at me I'm so
moderate I'm so centrist I'm so ready to
negotiate and compromise and you know
hey Trump is the only really bad
Republican I love all the other
Republicans those are good people but
Trump is an anomaly and man is he crazy
and is he outside the realm of what's
acceptable and people looked at that
said she's the establishment candidate
 that I'm gonna go with the
anti-establishment candidate Trump they
rolled the dice on a crazy reality host
because Hillary was that unpalatable
because she was so establishment and she
made arguments like Chris Cuomo is
saying they should the Democrats should
make now
arguments like Oh
so centrist look at us we agree with the
Republicans Chris I got news for you
buddy the American people hate the
Republican Party and the Democratic
Party they hate both parties so why do
you want the Democrats to run a
candidate who's like I agree with both
parties that's literally the last thing
that any candidate should do a can that
has a much better shot at they come
along and say hey I hate the Democrats
and the Republicans I think you're both
terrible I think you're both not
representing the American people
Congress has an approval rating of 16%
and you want the can take that's gonna
come along and say I agree with both of
these very unpopular parties what an
idiot you're such an idiot
but this is all they talk about in
Washington DC this is all they say in
their in their sycophantic circle jerk
of elitists where they're like oh this
this this is the argument that will win
elections but you've tried that for
decades and you keep losing that's the
exact argument that the Democrats used
throughout the Obama years and what
happened the Democrats lost a thousand
seats who's the most popular politician
in America right now Bernie Sanders
Bernie Sanders is the guy who says I
don't like either party the Republicans
are terrible and I'm trying to beg the
Democrats to move in the right direction
but they're not listening to me so the
guy who regularly shits on both parties
and money in politics and talks about
income inequality and says hey let's do
free college and Medicare for all in a
living wage
that's the guy who everybody's like I
like that guy so the second part here of
what Biden said is good that's good
that's how you win elections you talk
about concrete solutions tell people hey
I'm for free college that's what you do
that's what yeah I'm for free college
I'm for free healthcare I'm for a living
wage I'm for legalizing marijuana I'm
for a giant jobs program that rebuilds
our infrastructure this is how you win
elections so Biden when push comes to
shove you put Biden in a corner and
he'll actually start making some of the
right arguments but the problem is his
message isn't sharp enough and you saw
that in the first part of what I showed
you because when you give him it's
almost like when you give him too much
of an open-ended way to answer a
question that's when he's all over the
place oh you know trumpet the
nationalism is bad and abdicating power
and phony populism and bigotry but
America is great and that's why things
are
terrible but they're great and I'm
optimistic and we have good venture
capitalists Oh Joe what are you saying
so listen I hope it doesn't come down to
Biden versus Trump I really do
I hope we have a populist left candidate
who's really against the establishment
not somebody who's mostly with the
establishment but occasionally bucks the
establishment like Joe Biden but I did
want to give you a breakdown of if he
runs which seems likely at this point
what to expect from him from Joe Biden
if he were to run you can expect
basically half the time for him to make
terrible arguments and come across not
well but the other half the time you can
expect him to actually stumble upon some
of the correct arguments so you know
look I think if it was in 2016 and it
was Biden versus Trump instead of
Hillary versus Trump I think Biden would
won but I don't even want to have a
question about it I know Bernie would
have won I know it with Biden it's like
no he'd probably win but there's a
chance Trump wins so I don't know let's
not roll the dice anymore let's let's go
with the safe option who the person who
we know is gonna win and the safe option
is not the centrist option Chris Cuomo
the safe option is the left option
well hello mofos hey hey all my
cellphones in Guam look like Guatemala
on the other side of the Ring sure it's
not gonna interfere with the UH with the
feed your internet actually does look
better so far today I like my computer
knock on wood man but every week we say
this [ __ ] or like I let's not jinx it
but I refreshed my skype unusually I'm
such an idiot because the the Mac laptop
asked me what the like administrator
like name is and password mm-hm and I
usually never know what it is and then
just today I was like I think it's just
corn and my password hard type that [ __ ]
a minute worked Oh God there you go like
so dumb
oh it's what it is nailing a password on
this first try is such a it's like oh
what a relief this is so that's a good
feeling
then you'll try to go to the same [ __ ]
three months later and then you forget
it you're like yeah just had this how
did this [ __ ] happen well anyway so
they worked like I did every update on
skype and it was like you want to do
this [ __ ] to Oz like it [ __ ] it do it
and did like some extra [ __ ] how long
did it take it probably was a long
upgrade it wasn't that long to be honest
with you it was actually quick it like
it wasn't one of those that took forever
and was like remember back in the day
like the piece of paper used to be like
no you don't remember that what you
would download something yeah I do I do
I remember that and you would say like
this will be done in six hours and 54
seconds and then like you wait six hours
and it be like you've got another 12
hours
yeah it's uh it looks good so that's
good news
we got 82 polls that we have to do today
so we should probably jump right into
the polls let's get it so first of all
we'll do morning showerer verse night
shower because we debated that last time
and I'm very interested to see what
people have to say about that
I know I guess what's my turn on that
[ __ ] I am a morning shower but there
isn't a greater feeling of showering and
then going into your bed when it's like
freshly when you're fresh yeah so I'm
come I'm curious what the audience will
say my guess is that most
we'll say morning because my guess is
that most people shower in the morning
so they're just gonna do like a quick
like tribalism thing of like yeah that's
my [ __ ] so I'm gonna do that but then I
think you're right that if people were
to stop and think about it like I was
mostly a morning shower person my whole
life but when I stop and think about it
the thought of the night shower is
actually better because for the reasons
you described when you're done showering
and you go to lay down and you're like
oh [ __ ] I feel so clean in this bed
right now but also some people like my
wife had a problem she used to sweat a
lot in her sleep like some people like
you know have wet dreams some people
she's gonna hate the fact that you just
mentioned that I know that [ __ ] was bad
like if she would wake up in puddles of
sweat you know not for nothing not for
nothing and it might also make her
better than I'm about to say this it
feel better is that I think I actually
have that too
sometimes I feel like I sweat at night
ya know we're not even because like the
room like this whatever just sweat it
could be so many different things maybe
like an intense dream or like like I
don't what the [ __ ] the cause of that is
bollocks
nothing used to help her I never
regularly got a wet dream
were you like not in your sleep yeah I
mean I had I think I had it like a few
times but it wasn't like you know it
wasn't even when I was going through
puberty it happened that after that what
the [ __ ] is this [ __ ] mm-hmm but I
didn't have that regularly and they
thought like how often does that happen
with other people like is that a thing
work when people go through puberty like
four nights a week they wake up and they
nodded themselves yeah probably I mean
like or if you're just like I don't know
maybe you watched something before you
went to sleep of like us like a sexy ass
girl on a commercial or something and
that's the last thing on your mind yeah
you know what I think it's when I was uh
when I was like 19 20 and all that I was
probably jerking off so much that I just
drained myself of all mind up and so I
didn't have any left but I went to sleep
nothing left in the tank yeah so I never
really had that but that's a weird
concept isn't it I've had this it's a
strange concept I'm sure those people
have had sex dreams like there was like
there was a time when I was like
dreaming I was having sex and I woke up
was literally [ __ ] my bed like like
oh I was like laying on my stomach and
just like pumping and I was like holy
[ __ ] I'm sleeping and I'm [ __ ] my bed
this is crazy like when I woke up and I
was like oh my god I'm like actually
doing it yeah and that's a bad feeling
yet when you wake up and you're like
damn I'm not [ __ ] begging Giselle and
then I wasn't once you wake up and you
realize you're doing it it's like you
can't finish that it's like no no just
keep [ __ ] my bed and use like
basically my belly and the sheets as the
fake vagina here is that what I'm gonna
do
that'd be so sad they got the robots and
[ __ ] now so I wouldn't be surprised
people just close their eyes and
envision whatever the [ __ ] they want
oh that's coming man I saw a funny thing
i retweeted the other day somebody was
like how do you unlink your Twitter from
Amazon and then the very next tweet was
the dude bought like a big-ass and
vagina like a thing that you're supposed
to [ __ ] oh man and it was like I just
purchased this on Amazon after a while I
was like [ __ ] it and he just bought it
every time he buys something on Amazon
it shows up on his Twitter yeah I guess
he linked it somehow oh that's that's
probably not a good move yeah I mean
that happens sometimes if people have
their Twitter link to their YouTube and
they like a video sometimes it
automatically tweets it and like you
like this video
oh I mean I know that's happened too
I mean we spoke about like when the
Knicks assistant coach Kurt Rambis is
like this old white dude he's like in
like Asian like porn videos or some I
thought it was the next actual coach
wasn't it Jeff no and a hornacek wasn't
doing it was Kurt Rambis which is just
having funnier because he just sits
there in silence or the other coach and
he stands there and looks like a G well
Ted Cruz got got to oh yeah yeah and
then he had to blame it on like a
staffer like who was the [ __ ] you
kidding Ted who are you kidding
it's not a staffer it's you yeah those
are bad but like the Amazon thing
there's no context behind it so if
you're buying like elephant jelly or
some [ __ ] people are like what the [ __ ]
is he doing with that yeah I was just
trying to think are there are there
things I'm embarrassed to buy yeah of
course
there are even buying toilet papers like
were you ever embarrassed to buy condoms
back in the day that's a big debate well
yeah no yeah I'm embarrassed to buy
anything that's somewhat private like
even toilet paper so you buy it in
domestic cashiers like using it and
you're like yep I'm gonna take a [ __ ]
and wipe my ass with that
that's like they're holding the thing
that's gonna be all up on your ass in a
second yeah that's true wipes are
probably even worse because you're like
yo my thing is messy down there yeah but
that funny thing is that [ __ ] it's
cleaner too like I said like you're
saying I'm cleaner than other people if
I'm buying these wipes that's true yeah
but you're cleaner because your [ __ ] is
Messier like if you do you could be a
normal [ __ ] but use those those wipes
just to be clean I think anyone who uses
wipes knows nah because it's gonna be a
little bit messy my ground on this son
because I just started using these bang
and ass wipes and I will just cuz like I
feel like yes yes wipe if it's just on
some regular like I just took a nice
deal no just use the why because you
know I was thinking about it and this
like for example throughout Europe they
use bidets so they're everyday almost
all those places have bidets where after
you take a [ __ ] water squirts in your
ass and cleans it and then you what and
then you wipe yourself and you get super
clean from that we don't we just don't
have that in the US and everybody just
uses toilet paper and like you know you
can make the argument yeah that's
totally fine why not just use toilet
paper but then when you stop and think
about it it's like well if you really
want your ass to be clean you either got
to do a bidet or you got to do some sort
of a wipe and so I was like yeah I
actually want to use a wipe now because
that's just that makes sense to me like
it'll be cleaner and it'll be better and
so I found these flushable wipes and
they're they're good I like yeah there's
nothing better than when someone has
wipes in their bathroom because when
you're using toilet paper if there was a
survey of like how many asses are
actually clean yeah just use toilet
paper you know it's not high enough it's
like yeah I know when I'm at work or
something like that like I'm just doing
a couple wipes unless it's like if it's
super messy I'll probably do less wipes
actually those like yeah I gotta get
back to my desk
and even probably even way more with
dudes cuz hairy ass isn't [ __ ] and like
ya take a [ __ ] with your hairy ass and
then go to wipe it would just toilet
paper it's like no use a wipe or
something or yeah why shouldn't needs to
get on their bidet [ __ ] like that should
be standard but we're already we're too
far down the path of not having them
it's not like everybody's just gonna
randomly I mean I guess you can't train
Americans to use that portable ones now
though where you can attach it to your
toilet and use it really yeah like it I
don't know portable is not the right
word but like you connect it to your
toilet and then have you ever used one
because like I've seen them I've seen
pictures of them I've never actually
held my ass everyone I know that they
have Japanese toilets that it comes in
the toilet also like really good they're
really nice toilets and like when the
water splashes up from the toilet when
you're done you press a button or
something and then they it does it and
apparently it feels great I'm sure it
feels amazing imagine you don't even
have to [ __ ] you just go in there it's
good to squirt the hot water in your ass
or like I'm starting to realize that
anything with like a little bit of like
warmth to it or heat to it is just like
it's such a good feeling like it does so
much good for your body like I was
taking a nap and I just woke up and I
made like a nice hot chocolate and it
just like warmth in my body and it like
starts my brain up and like when I Drive
like my wife's car she's got on the
steering wheel all this steering wheel
like who would [ __ ] thought of that
and it's just like you're driving and
your hands are feeling warm well my mom
recently got a heated floor in her
bathroom I've seen people with that sue
is genius yeah and she loves it she's
like you could keep it at an exact
temperature I'm like yeah that's what
I'm saying but honey because extreme
heat and extreme cold they're both used
in a therapeutic way so you have like a
sauna or a steam room and you those get
really hot and playable is there to
exfoliate and then there's the other
thing too I just called a cryo chamber
where like you put your the culture
right yeah and a really cool thing and
they're both supposed to have
therapeutic effects and yeah that's cool
and cool that apparently extremes on
both sides to do that obviously you
can't go overboard with it or else
you're putting you're putting yourself
in danger
but I used to love heat heat more like I
used to be in the summer it was my
favorite even if it was like 90 degrees
I was like oh this is I like hot weather
I just like being in hot weather but if
I got older heat now I don't do as well
with and I prefer to be in like cooler
weather so I'd rather be outside in 43
degrees than 93 degrees yeah I think I
would agree with that one too yeah yeah
because now I feel like stuffy when it's
hot yeah I'm almost like geez I even
though I don't have trouble breathing
I'm almost at the point where it's like
a psychological thing where I'm like I
feel like it's hard to breathe because
like the air is too thick and it's like
the heat can be oppressive yeah but I
also feel like the heat is just so much
good for the like so much better for
your body and [ __ ] like that like people
live in Arizona or Florida or something
like that well yeah it takes someone
from that like just the like birth and
they do grow up in both places and they
eat the same [ __ ] like the person in the
heat my opinion is gonna live longer
just because it's better for your bones
or whatever well I know that when people
have aches and pains and [ __ ] when they
get older they will move to a climate
that's like in Florida or something
because it's better with you know they
don't have as many aches or pains or
whatever yeah apparently the cold does
have some sort of an effect where you
feel that more people want that heat
when they get older so even on a smaller
scale like tote like toasting a [ __ ]
sub or something just like the heat in
your mouth tastes better than if you
just eat like a regular eyes piece of
bread yeah I do prefer a hot meal to
another that meal for sure um so the
next poll we were gonna we wanted to do
a beer poll but we have to figure out
which of beers we want to put on there
mmm um so obviously we're gonna put
corona god because you you and I are
both Corona guys mom I'm pretty sure we
probably have to put I mean we have to
put like Budweiser Bud Light or
something right
I feel like well I I think I saw a pole
that light like Bud Light was like the
top beer or some [ __ ] like that so we'll
have to do Bud Light then yeah but then
if you do bulla you got to do
Coors Light too or some cheese yeah I
mean I guess that's see that's why we
needed to talk it out we gotta figure
what Heinekens got to be on there people
that's a go-to for people so then that's
our
pull right there Corona Heineken Bud
Light Coors Light yeah okay there's not
I mean there's other beers that I like
better like I actually like fosters the
Australian boss's is good by Michelob
you we used to get down on remember when
we were doing our diets who drink those
Michelob Ultra Ball tree yeah like
that's the thing is like see this is why
the pole is so hard like I know Foster's
can't make the pole because it's too
like obscure yeah I'd think you'd like
make a lobes competing like I feel like
Mick maybe throw a Michelob on there
instead of Coors Light you know what I
mean
like I think you would just get it would
get waxed really yeah I think Michael
like that's it's going extinct soon
that's like a really I know sir yeah I
don't think anybody's going to the bar
odor and Michelob 's anymore okay so if
they are that's it's in the back of the
[ __ ] fridge even the bartender's like
like new bartenders I haven't heard of
Michelob Corona Bud Light Heineken Coors
Coors Light how the [ __ ] do you spell
Hynek goddamn it why can't there be like
intuitive names you know like Dave's ear
[Laughter]
Heineken oh my god I would have spelled
it right I'm tonight is like now there's
like just weird hipster beers and all
that [ __ ] like perhaps I mean like
that's the thing is people who are gonna
respond to this poll like I like blue
moon bro yeah there's this [ __ ] they
only sell in Wisconsin and I live like
ten minutes from the Wisconsin border
line it's called spotted cow
oh [ __ ] [ __ ] is bangin it sounds like
you're drinking a cow's bile yeah it's
whatever they put in that [ __ ] is mad
good so I feel like I'm not happy with
the ones that were really going with but
I know we have to put Bud Light I know
we have to put Corona I know we have to
put Heineken mm-hmm
Coors Light I feel like we could replace
with another beer but I kind of hear you
that it's really up there in the like in
the beer sphere yeah and I mean I don't
know what else would replace it like
boom-boom is big now that ain't big
enough
okay so there's Amstel I'm looking now I
just looked at
there's Stella which is the that's a big
one
Guinness yeah that's not I wouldn't even
I mean is that a beer I mean it's yeah
it's a dark yeah
Denis yeah I guess the Miller Lite nor
Beck's
back the singer Beck the singer we drink
his pee yeah I mean I guess we got to do
Coors Light unless I'm trying to think
of anything else unless Stella I mean I
feel like if we throw that in the pole
that could be like a come-from-behind
type [ __ ] I thinks how Stella got her
groove back imagine I typed that whole
thing out on the poll of people like
what the [ __ ] are you doing dough sekiz
odo sakis - world's most interesting all
right [ __ ] it we're putting course and
then people are gonna every there's
gonna be so many responses at this bowl
I would boot this would natty light is
big for colleges for colleges but again
like that's the thing is like so if I
had my druthers I put I put fosters on
here but I know yeah that doesn't belong
in the top four yeah like I'm trying to
narrow it down to the top four and just
let it rock but yeah I don't think it
makes that top four alright last
question ditch Coors Light for Stella or
no no no no I don't think so yeah
because there's Stella and I'm thinking
but I feel like Korres is like an old
white dude beer like if like if you're a
60-year old white dude you've been
drinking Coors forever but like you're
not listening to this show if you're a
60-year old white dude there's unless
you maybe eight percent of my audience
is a six-year old white dude no offense
to you guys I love you but I'm just
saying that like Kourt my point is
Korres is not gonna have a big
contingent among my Twitter followers
where there might be some people who are
like I like Stella if you wanted to
cover the light category you did Coors
Light but then you took Bud Light off
and did Budweiser because Budweiser
but the thing is the the heavier beers I
don't know that I feel like the light is
to go to more than not then why does
definitely to go to Corona
I just put Corona I didn't put korone
light I didn't put Corona extra I just
put Corona so maybe whatever you did
Budweiser
/ Bud Light and then Coors Light
Budweiser / Bud Light Coors Light /
course course like yeah yeah yeah as if
you're like a Coors drink like yeah if
you're in the Bud Light category if you
don't have an option for budweis yeah
that covers both of them Corona
I'm so I hate the [ __ ] contestants on
every single one of Ellen's shows
YouTube is at it again [ __ ] with the
algorithms and making their platform
more controlled from the top down and
worse so look at this YouTube's new
attempts to limit propaganda draws fire
from PBS so that's interesting now PBS
is upset well let me explain what
they're doing what they're doing here is
they're labeling government-funded
outlets on YouTube now that comes with a
warning like a banner anytime you watch
a video funded by a an outlet that gets
a lot of funding from the government so
they're labeling them and they're
letting people know like hey just to be
clear look at where the funding comes
from for these videos you might want to
take it with a grain of salt that's the
gist of it and they rolled it out slowly
so for example on artis videos that's
what this is really about they want to
say they rush it propaganda rdrd some
people already got the messages but
they're rolling it out slowly I think at
some point all of us are gonna have it
unless they decide to go in the other
direction now because of the backlash
from this but well what's happening is
now PBS is finally paying attention
because it's affecting them before it
affects them they have nothing to say
about it they don't care that's the
nature of the way this stuff works so
when it was D monetization well it
didn't affect them that badly so
whatever we don't care
well affected independent media outlets
like myself the D monetization scandal
the ad pocalypse as we called it well
what happens when there was the D
prioritisation scandal that's the new
one is that new people have a harder
time seeing my videos as well as the
videos of other independent creators
because we're deprioritized
so in other words YouTube is pushing
more traditional media outlets that
corporate media outlets MSNBC CNN so if
somebody's not already a fan of secular
talk it's harder for them to stumble
across a video of mine in the related
video section it used to be anything you
look at that's political online anything
there'd be a video The Young Turks that
pops up there because they have even
more videos than I do but a video of
secular talk as well and we're just
everywhere but now when you deprioritize
us in the algorithm
and put us in a lower level now we're
not everywhere now it's harder for us to
gain we were gaining 30,000 subscribers
a month not that long ago 30,000 a month
30,000 now we're gaining like 3,000
listen I'm open to the idea that some of
the drop-off is because the elections
over so people aren't as interested in
politics totally even if you tell me hey
man we're gonna chop that number in half
you're gonna get thirty thousand a month
then it's gonna be 15,000 I'd say damn
50 percent is a big drop-off but you
know what maybe maybe that's just
because of the election but when you go
from 30,000 to like 3000 there's there's
an algorithm issue there - but listen
this isn't just conjecture I'm gonna get
to the facts in a second here but isn't
it amazing that now PBS speaks up did
PBS say anything when they when the US
government decided RT is gonna be
labeled as a foreign agent remember that
coz is it's stunning that they said yes
foreign agent but did they say that
about Al Jazeera no did they say that
about the BBC No so in other words the
argument is not oh let's just be honest
with everybody and let them know that
these are government-funded outlets the
argument is let that one outlet from
Russia we're gonna scare people about
that one outlet and let the other ones
off the hook that was the US government
well now u2 is doing this and they're
doing it with government-funded outlets
across the board and now finally since
it's affecting PBS they're going oh [ __ ]
no this is a bad idea
and by the way man listen I so I take
everything from RT on when they talk
about Russia related issues with a grain
of salt but other issues they're just as
good if not better than other outlets I
mean ed Schultz is on RT he's he was
fired by MSNBC when he opposed the TPP
you have Thom Hartmann he's over there
I think Lee camp is over there Abby
Martin used to be over there and when
she was over there she criticized
Putin's move in Crimea annexing Crimea
so there's a lot of good hosts over
there but because of this hysteria
they're just trying to smear the whole
network
can act like no don't take any word they
say seriously well listen I'll take what
they say on the on Russian issues with a
grain of salt but I'm also gonna take
what CNN and MSNBC say about foreign
policy issues with a grain of salt why
they get tremendous you know money from
the military-industrial complex
go ahead watch one of the sunday shows
Meet the Press or whatever you'll see an
ad for like Raytheon or Boeing and
you're like what the [ __ ] what are they
trying to sell people in the audience
[ __ ] anti-aircraft missiles know what
they're doing is they're buying
corporate media's silence on their
[ __ ] that's what they're doing oh
don't do that expose on Raytheon or
Boeing they give a lot of money to the
network that's what that is
you have to read Noam Chomsky's
manufacturing consent to understand this
the propaganda that's spewed by
corporate media is just as servile to
the US government if not more servile
then state media is funded by
governments so that's a mind-blowing
fact but it's true and he details it in
just painstaking with a painstaking
amount of research he shows you know
this is the case and I'll prove it
here's how they're always doing
propaganda for US imperialism and the US
government but again is there gonna be a
warning on MSNBC and CNN are they gonna
say warning MSNBC fired every host who
was against the Iraq war are you gonna
say that no are they gonna say warning
they take a tremendous amount of money
from the military-industrial complex
warning they take a tremendous amount of
ad money from Exxon Mobil so be careful
about what they say on climate issues on
on Fox News are they gonna say warning
they're funded one of their main
stakeholders is Prince Alois bid until
all a Saudi prince or Saudi whatever the
billionaire Saudi guy are they gonna say
warning Fox News has close ties to the
Saudi government not gonna say that
again this is why people call this a Red
Scare because they're they're using that
issue Russia Russia Russia to crack down
on dissenting voices and now since
you're you're moving slowly towards
going after the mainstream also like PBS
now everybody's like whoa whoa wait what
we've been telling you about this from
the beginning but you didn't care when
it was just
you didn't care so now earlier I said
this isn't just conjecture on my part
this is a fact that there are D
prioritizing us look at this admission
in the middle of the article quote in
November Eric Schmidt the former
executive chairman of Google's parent
alphabet said that the company would D
rank R T and N and another Russian
government affiliated news outlet
Sputnik in its search results in an
effort to curb misleading and
exploitative content Schmidt added that
the company does not want to ban the
outlets and Google later clarified that
the company does not deer a deer ank
individual websites so ok you see what
they just did there there's an admission
there the admission is ok what more do
you guys want we made it so that the
algorithm is biased against RT and
Sputnik and we made us that we're
burying their videos what more do you
want that's that was his argument and
then when people were like whoa did you
just admit that you're like censoring
that outlet Google was like no no we
don't do you rank things you just said
you did the former head just said yeah
we do ranked him what more do you want
so that's the admission because YouTube
has been maintaining from the very
beginning and we knew it was lies cuz
we're youtubers so we know like no we
what do you know we're not no we're not
[ __ ] you know taking you know your
show Kyle in the humanist report and
Jimmy Dore and David Pakman and to be
fair right-wing outlets too and and set
and taking them and putting them in a
lower priority when it comes to
recommended boxes on the side why am i
all of a sudden unable to talk properly
when it comes to the search engine on
the side we're not we're not deep
prioritizing your stuff we don't do
ranked anybody and put them in a lower
tier well again I know you've done that
because I see the numbers on the back
end and I know what's in anomaly and I
know what's normal and we're in a
situation where looks like a permanent
anomaly because we're being
deprioritized and I told you guys show
the beginning it's not just us there's
been a 60% cut in our revenue on YouTube
there was a time when it was a 99
percent cut thankfully
they got we got off the blacklist which
was the new we're not gonna give you any
ads but now we're just in a lower level
of ads and again it's not just me it's
virtually every independent media outlet
that's what we're dealing with now
so they admit it and they're like no no
we didn't [ __ ] say that yes you did
say that and we already know because we
have the facts on our side we have the
numbers to show it and then again this
is where it gets a little conspiratorial
but it's not really conspiratorial
because I get the messages all the time
so what is everybody lying at once or is
everybody misunderstanding it people are
always getting unsubscribed from my show
and then the other one is you know
people will subscribe and click the
notification bell and then they just get
sun clicked what why they subscribe and
click the notification then all of a
sudden they don't get the notifications
what it's all because of this it's all
because of this and listen right before
I came on air another story look top
Intel dam warns foreign spies could be
manipulating YouTube okay here we go
again
here we go again here we go again here
we go again here we go again so now it's
not just oh my god fake news crackdown
on the independent outlets and say like
they're all like Alec Alex Jones now
it's not just that now its own foreign
spies too you know what they use as
evidence that foreign spies are on
YouTube I'm not kidding about this it's
gonna sound like I'm kidding I'm not
kidding they say in the article there
were six times as many anti-hillary
videos as there were anti-trump videos
and you think that's evidence of foreign
spies aren't that's not evidence of that
at all you know what that means you
idiots
that means Hillary Clinton's candidacy
pissed off the entire right wing every
right-wing outlet online and half of the
left-wing outlets that's what that means
because all the the left-wing outlets
The Young Turks myself Jimmy Dore
humanist report David Pakman Sam cedar
especially in the primary we were all
Bernie's uh boarders all of us so yeah
there were a lot of anti Hillary videos
because those things
to be pointed out she voted for the Iraq
war she voted for the Patriot Act she
supported NAFTA we're talking about a
hawk who is in favor of deregulation and
was Republican light her entire career
so yes we got we pointed that out
because that's her [ __ ] job is to
give the facts but they say oh that's
anti-hillary biased there were six times
as many anti Hillary videos as anti
Trump videos again a giant portion of
that is because the left was being
principled and going after Hillary when
she disagreed with us and also because a
lot of the anti Trump stuff is just duh
so we don't need to talk about that as
much because it's duh now that he's
president I would argue talk about a lot
more see obviously has more power but
that's not evidence of anything but they
say up foreign spies Florence what the
[ __ ] and it's listen it's Google it's
YouTube it's Facebook - Facebook - you
know what Facebook did sorry news and
politics we're gonna put you to the side
now people are gonna get more stuff with
friends and family
well you just took out there are many
news outlets independent news outlets
that their primary way of getting their
news out is Facebook you just crush them
on a whim doing it on purpose they want
to push the establishment outlets
because the establishment outlets that's
them
Mark Zuckerberg establishment guy
considering running for president he
wants independent outlets like me
[ __ ] on his attempt to run for
president on his own platform if he were
to decide that no they don't want that
it's ever it's Twitter - sending out the
letters Oh careful you retweeted
something that could have been Russian
propaganda what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ]
and they wouldn't again they'd never say
CNN it's fake news even though they've
spread fake news we know they had
virtually every US outlet called torture
enhanced interrogation because Bush said
we want you to call an enhanced
interrogation you know that is that's a
lie that's propaganda that's fake news
it's [ __ ] torture it's torture when
Iran does it it's torture when any other
country doesn't it's torture when we do
it but they called it enhanced
interrogation because they're puppets of
the state but they're never gonna say Oh
deprioritize CNN they said it was
enhanced interrogation they're never
gonna they all downplayed the WikiLeaks
emails which were factual did hey this
is what Hillary said she said there's
big
against the rich and we should be kinder
to the rich she wants totally free and
open trade borders which is like NAFTA
on steroids she said that they go ah
that source is from Russia so that's
propaganda the facts you're giving me or
propaganda and the places that don't
give those facts we're gonna prop them
up what they even said on many
mainstream US outlets all the WikiLeaks
stuff is fake it's not fake they just
call it fake so are you gonna deep-fry
or tie CNN and MSNBC because they said
it's fake when it wasn't no the game is
rigged the game is rigged and they're
gonna use it to crack down on
independent outlets across the board you
need to support people who you like at
this point I know this sounds like a
cheap plug but it's really not because
this is what we've been dealing with for
a long time and it is scary thankfully
you guys have made it so that we're
primarily grassroots funded now you're
the main source of funding for this show
and I appreciate every single one of you
that do it if you just want to give two
bucks a month on patreon so we can keep
doing the show exactly as is its
patreon.com slash secular talk again
I really really appreciate that all of
you do that and I actually take pride in
the fact now that I can tell people yeah
this is primarily grassroots funded
because you know what that is that's a
giant middle finger to all these [ __ ]
stories and all the ways that they're
slyly de prioritizing us and screwing
over independent content creators that's
you guys saying to them you know what we
don't care throw the [ __ ] kitchen
kitchen sink at us and we got their back
and that's something they would never
have ever nobody's gonna [ __ ]
crowdfund
wolf blitzer's pouring ass if something
were to happen to a CNN job never
because doesn't stand for anything he
just reads the [ __ ] prompter he's
like Ron Burgundy and everything the
prompter is usually stupid and
uninteresting so it says a lot that you
guys have said you know what yes here's
two bucks a month we appreciate what you
do and keep doing it so patreon.com
slash secular talk and always think of
the other content creators too if you
love their stuff whether it's humanists
report or jimmy dore or tim black or
david pakman or sam cedar and listen
there's with all those people we don't
agree on everything in fact there's
massive disagreement on a lot of
different things
but there's a you know a flavor for each
particular version of left-winger on
YouTube and whoever you support you know
basically what I'm saying is support
them if you support them because we're
all going through it and it's just that
some people aren't as vocal about it you
know what I mean
some of us are out here really
highlighting this stuff and talking
about it all the time
others don't talk about it as much but I
know from conversations with them that
they're they're all struggling so if you
could look out for them too that'd be
great
so guess what everybody I'm partly
honored and partly annoyed that I've
been smeared by a right-wing blog so
this is from the Gateway pundit and I
don't know what they think they're
achieving here by digging up old tweets
of mine but I think that they think they
got me so we're gonna go through this
and we're gonna discuss it literally
every PR expert in the world if they
were giving me advice would tell me no
don't talk about this gateway pundit
pundit is a tiny far right-wing blog so
there's no way to no reason to bring
this up and therefore like expose your
whole audience to it but I don't give a
[ __ ] because as I think all of you know
by now the main thing about secular talk
is honesty authenticity and transparency
so even though it's a little
embarrassing we're gonna go through the
old tweets that gateway pundit dug up of
mine and then you guys can make a
determination if indeed I am sexist and
homophobic and racist I'm all of the
ists okay so this is Cassandra Fairbanks
wrote this she used to be a left winger
allegedly I think she supported Bernie
Sanders but then she supported Donald
Trump in the general election and now
her and Mike Serna [ __ ] hang out all
day and try to figure out how to smear
left-wingers so she says tweets
uncovered by the gateway pundit reveal a
history of homophobia sexism and racism
precisely what he spends so much time
judging others for now what you're gonna
see here there's going to be a bunch of
things that you see here ninety-eight
percent of the stuff I don't feel bad
about at all
two percent of the stuff I feel a little
bad about and again I'll explain it as I
go on here but she's gonna she lacks a
lot of context and that's obviously on
purpose so first she cites the Justice
Democrats platform page by the way I'm
not affiliated with justice Democrats
anymore so you're not
this doesn't accomplish anything like
what do you want me to step down from
the place I already stepped down from
that's not gonna happen this is an
attempt to just smear me and smear the
left and act like all the things I care
about don't matter anymore because
sometimes I said things that were
questionable but this is from the
Justice Democrats platform we must speak
out against racism sexism xenophobia and
all forms of bigotry non-discrimination
protections that currently apply to race
religion and gender should be expanded
to include the LGBTQ community and the
atheist community so then she has some
tweets of mine she thinks this is like
setting me up for a gotcha where I said
in 2016 pointing out bigotry racism and
double standards is not bigotry racism
double standard and uncomfortable fact
that simpletons can't swallow so in
other words what I'm referring to there
is there's a trick that people on the
far right like to use if you call out
something that is actually racist you
know like for example Donald Trump
repeatedly questioning Obama's birth
certificate and then when he showed the
short form and the long form birth
certificate and the announcement of
Hawaii newspaper of his birth he goes oh
yeah well I want to see your college
transcripts so you just keep moving the
goalposts because hey you know it this
guy's skin color has something to do the
fact that I'm not going to accept him as
a legitimate president or if you point
out facts about the drug war and how
it's disproportionately targeted on
minorities when you point that out some
people go oh you're being racist by
pointing that out so they're in over is
by pointing out racism and trying to fix
it they're calling you racist just
because you brought up race so that's
what I'm pointing to there another thing
is if conservatives want us to stop
calling out racism they should stop
being racist now this one lacks context
this tweet is from 2014 my birthday in
2014 by the way that's random but I
think I'm referring to something
specific there I don't remember what the
specific thing was but there was
something in the news in 2014 at that
time that it was a super racist thing I
don't remember what it was but me saying
if conservatives want us to stop calling
out racism they should stop being racist
it was in regards to a space
civic story where the reaction from the
right was in my estimation racist again
she leaves out the context of course she
leaves out the context because then that
makes these comments look a lot less
reasonable but now we get into the
controversial stuff while kolinsky
spends a hefty amount of time judging
others it looks as though he has been
throwing stones from inside a glass
house in 2012 kolinsky asserted all
Asians look the same okay I'm sorry for
laughing because this is actually in the
2% that I feel kind of bad about like
yeah that's [ __ ] up that's a [ __ ] up
thing to say I shouldn't have said it
the thing I put hashtag there I said it
because I was trending on Twitter at the
time yeah there honestly there's no
excuse for this one it's [ __ ] up I
really shouldn't have said it it's not
true and it just shows like I'm a dick
so I do kind of I do feel bad about that
one I shouldn't have said that I will
add though that there this is the this
is what they're using as evidence that
I'm racist and that's just not that's
not true I'm not saying I wasn't saying
Asians are inferior to anybody the
definition of racism is you think you're
superior and other races are inferior I
don't believe that I've never said that
I never would say that I never would
believe that I'm wholly convinced that
that's not the case so this that's not
racism it's just me being an [ __ ] and
saying something I shouldn't I said but
I do apologize for that one because
that's not cool man don't like don't
don't [ __ ] say that
then okay let's keep going here this is
one the next one is one I don't feel bad
about at all oh and by the way let me
just say I'm Joe Rogan reached out to me
over the weekend I'm gonna be on his
podcast on February 27th so everybody
can look forward to that I know I'm
really excited for that and unless just
say I don't think it's a coincidence
that like it was yesterday or two days
ago that me and Joe Rogan set this thing
up and it like immediately after that
happened boom there's an article and a
far right-wing blog smearing me do you
think that's coincidence I don't think
that's a coincidence Joe Rogan has a
gigantic
reach and you know I I don't think that
people on the right want somebody like
me having the ability to reach a wider
audience because not to toot my own horn
I think I'm pretty [ __ ] convincing and
I can make a good case for left-wing
stuff so I don't think it's a
coincidence that I you know a few days
ago I was offered basically my biggest
platform ever to go on Joe show and then
boom immediately somebody they dig up
old tweets by the way how sad are you if
you sit there and go through old tweets
I mean they were talking about a tweet
from [ __ ] 2012 okay next she says
more recently kolinsky noted that Asians
aren't just yellow but varying shades of
beige - actually that's not what I said
I said they're not yellow they're
varying shades of beige so this was not
from not that long ago in fact I
remember when I wrote these and I stand
by everything I said here cuz stop and
use your [ __ ] brain instead of being
triggered like a little snowflake for a
second I said white people aren't really
white they're light beige okay that's
true you all know what white looks like
white looks like this the page right
here that's white white people people
who are called white don't look like
that they look like they are a light
beige that's accurate
that's just factual brown people are
more like dark beige again stop and
think about what when somebody says Oh
brown people they're referring to
usually Hispanic people or South Asian
people or Arab people and no they're not
actually brown they're like a dark beige
color so people who are called brown are
like a dark beige color I know that like
you're not allowed to say anything at
all about race under any circumstance
ever or else you know there will be some
people who are triggered but I don't
play that [ __ ] I don't care I don't care
if you're triggered it it doesn't
doesn't mean anything to me so you can
be the [ __ ] PC police all you want
about accurate thing things I say like
this here but it doesn't matter what I
said is still true another thing I said
is black people are different shades of
brown so in other words people who are
called black they're not really black
black is black usually people who are
called
their skin tone is actually their skin
tones or it's like a different shades of
brown and then I said apologies for
being so literal but it annoys me that
somebody made that other [ __ ] up and we
all have to run with it and then I said
whoever the [ __ ] called Asians yellow is
just a prick
they're obviously varying shades of
beige - yeah that's true
Asians are called yellow they're not
yellow I don't know why I don't know why
they're called yellow they're not yellow
it's just weird that we call B and like
a Native Americans are called Reds
they're not red again they're a
different shade of beige so I don't like
why why would you include this in your
article trying to smear me it just makes
me look like I'm I'm telling the truth
okay so let's continue anti-racist
darling also want you to know he hates
Asian drivers okay this one's [ __ ] up
- I said hashtag things we all hate
Asian drivers yeah that's [ __ ] up I
shouldn't have said that cuz that's not
true it's not this is it's a stereotype
like Oh Asian drivers are bad no like
there are plenty of Asian drivers who
are not bad and there are plenty of
drivers of other races and ethnicities
that are bad so this is one of the 2% of
things in this that I apologize for cuz
that's not right I mean again we're
talking about something I said in 2011
so like like why are we even talking
about this now but yeah it was [ __ ] up
I shouldn't have said that
in addition to his offensive tweets
about Asians there's also many examples
of him using the term [ __ ] over the
years despite the fact that he is not
black ah oh no oh no okay so let's see I
said to somebody damn can a [ __ ] get a
parking spot help a [ __ ] out and then
referring to somebody used to work with
Fabian tried that's the best we could do
without asking the [ __ ] for a photo op
I don't remember who I was talking about
there but it was some like low-level
celebrity and I said ni GGA by the way
let's just say ni GGA that is totally
different from ni Jie GE are like so
listen there are some things
that I used to say that I wouldn't say
anymore but I'm I this is not it's not
racist I was that awkward white boy who
used ni GGA because I thought I was cool
and like half of my friends were black
so I thought I was down and cool so I
used that and they were never offended
by it I you know never thought twice
about it it was I just always said that
I grew up in nourish L a very diverse
place in Westchester County and like
again I wouldn't say it now but to use
this as like evidence of me being racist
that's just not true
that's just not true at all and then
here's another one me saying to a friend
of mine who I used to work with in
response to something OD tweet Negro
again out of context I'm talking to a
friend here so I said Negro like
whatever get the [ __ ] over that's not a
big deal again these aren't things I'd
say now but it's not like stop trying to
pretend like this somehow makes me a
bigot a racist then again I said that in
response to somebody Negro these are
friends of mine like and weird [ __ ]
around then the next one this one's just
cringy because I just sound like a
douche partially because I am a douche
but somebody called me out they're like
dude like you're white why are you using
the n-word on Twitter again meaning ni
GGA I never said ni g GE r nor would I I
think that's horrendous and that's I
understand like the hurt that comes
along with that word and how in context
of course no white person should say ni
Jie Zhi er but he said you really like
using the n-word on your huh
can't say I agree homes I said got my G
pass god that's a cringy tweet
it's like yeah look at me I got my GPS I
could use it like no yeah again I
shouldn't have used it but I just it's
it's just not evidence of racism because
I'm not racist so here's another one I
said thanks [ __ ] listen this one again
I need to be
to be clear about something here
whenever I like so another thing we used
to say is if something happened and we
didn't like it we go gay and like now
that's not really something we do but we
did that for a really long time and
that's not that's not us arguing
we are against homosexuals and they
should not have equal rights because I
always believe they should have equal
rights it's almost like if you remember
that episode of South Park where I think
the it was [ __ ] I think they used the
word [ __ ] and they were like ah these
guys are [ __ ] and then people were like
ah how dare you you hate gay people and
they would say no no no we don't hate
gay people we're we're against [ __ ] and
then they go on to explain in the
episode they're referring to these biker
guys who have who are on their
motorcycles and they go like Leviathan
and it's a really funny episode but
there's actually a point in there and
the point is if somebody's uses the word
like oh that's gay that's they're
actually not saying hey gay people
aren't equal and we shouldn't treat them
equally that those are different things
it's just something that people said for
a while now you could say look that's
it's wrong and we shouldn't do that
anymore and maybe you're right about
that but I just don't like it when we
try to pretend like that means that
somebody's you know anti-gay cuz I've
always been in favor of gay marriage
I've always been in favor of gay rights
and to try to pretend like when I'm
saying something in jest to somebody
like thanks [ __ ] like that's the same
thing or thanks Negro like that's the
same thing as me being some sort of a
racist southern segregationist type
person who thinks other races are
inferior again that part is just not
true then I said how much gay sex do you
think is happening at the RNC in
Cleveland yeah I stand by oh and of
course that's like how many stories have
we covered about the people who are
massively anti-gay but then they get
caught blowing people like that's
happened time and time again whether
it's Christian preachers who are
far-right or Republican politicians and
by the way that's one of the things I
said after a story broke
the time that one of the gay dating apps
that like the the traffic to the gay
dating app increased some tremendous
amount in the wake of the RNC moving to
Cleveland so like there was a big bump
in in activity on that gay dating app
when the RNC went to Cleveland that year
so it's like yeah that's that's what
that's what [ __ ] happen like what why
are you acting like that's something
that's like wrong I'm first of all I'm
making a joke second of all the joke is
pointing at something that's true yeah
there was a lot of gay sex happening at
the RNC in Cleveland a lot of closeted
gay people got together and had sex I'm
not saying that's wrong by all means do
what teach their own go ahead have all
the gay sex you want but that number one
that was happening number two I am kind
of joking as I say that anyway so I
stand by that completely um then I said
somebody get my bail money ready legit
about to murder this loudmouth Italian
lady and the [ __ ] blasting her iPod
hashtag [ __ ] waiting rooms yeah I don't
remember what was happening there but me
calling a particular woman a [ __ ] has
nothing to do with as she says here
kolinsky also has a less than
progressive view on women including
referring to them as [ __ ] like no I'm
not referring to all women as [ __ ] I'm
referring to a very specific lady who
was pissing me off for a very specific
reason what I used the term [ __ ] now
probably not but I was mad at the time
and I said the word [ __ ]
that doesn't mean I think all women are
inferior it means that there was an
individual woman who I thought was a
[ __ ] at the time here's another one me
tweet quoting a friend of mine
prostitutes got job security I guess
always going to be a dick to suck I mean
it's still funny thing that he said so
yeah I don't think that's really a big
deal then I asked a question at one
point in 2012 who sucked more dicks in
their life Madonna or Britney Spears
okay so you're getting a trend here
what's going on I'm just an [ __ ] and
I think you guys know that anyway yeah
I don't like is there something sexist
about that tweet I don't think there's
something sexist about that tweet well
how why would somebody think that sexist
I'm just asking if who suck more dicks
in their life and I'm you know I would
guess Madonna when I stop and think
about it but I don't know I thought that
was an interesting question so I tweeted
it okay I should stop laughing this is
supposed to be serious and then I said
at one point in 2012 Elisabeth
Hasselbeck confuses my penis I say that
because you know she's an attractive
woman but she's so far-right politically
that I'm like oh my god you're
insufferable so yeah I don't really care
about that either I don't know why you
think that's like oh I got him he's
sexist like no none of these things are
sexist this is just me being a dick
that's all this is that's all this is I
would never say I think women are
inferior to men because I don't think
they're inferior to men by any stretch
of the imagination
I just thought one lady was a [ __ ] in
particular not all women I asked
questions about who sucked more dicks in
their life yeah this isn't like a big
deal get the [ __ ] over it and then
finally this this one pissed me off the
most from them because this is a smear
attempt and I'll explain why in a second
she says regarding the singer Kesha who
recently concluded a battle with her
former producer dr. Luke who she claims
had been sexually assaulting her
kolinsky declared she should write a
song called a mejor now here's why this
is a [ __ ] smear the date I said this
was 2011 this is years before Ke$ha a
clue accused dr. Luke of anything so the
impression she's trying to give you is
like oh my god kyle is talking about a
woman who just accused a guy of like
sexual assault and rape
Kyle's calling her a [ __ ] no that's not
true because at the time there were no
accusations of rape there were no
accusations of sexual assault or
anything so it was just Kesha I don't
know I was watching like one of her
music videos or something and she was
like damn near butt-ass naked or like
what were the lyrics to her first song
like down stop blah I listen to the
lyrics that song one day and I like
looked it up and I was like holy [ __ ]
this is like really [ __ ] now again
I'm not even putting her down for that
so I want to break down some of the
specific policy proposals in Donald
Trump's State of the Union address for
you let's start with corporate tax cuts
and deregulation we slashed the business
tax rate from thirty five percent all
the way down to twenty one percent so
American companies can compete and win
against anyone else anywhere in the
world in our drive to make Washington
accountable we have eliminated more
regulations in our first year than any
Administration in the history of our
country you know the Democrats have been
seized on this the media hasn't really
spoken about it but what he just said
right there is terrifying and there's
enough to say about that little sound
bite to hammer Trump in the Republicans
with and ride a wave in the next
election - giant victories so first of
all the corporate tax rate who brags
about cutting corporate taxes you know
politicians used to be smart enough to
know that if they do something like that
you got a you got to keep it on the hush
son keep it on the DL because people are
not it's not like you know a random dude
is sitting in his living room in
Kentucky like you know goddammit man I
really wish Berkshire Hathaway could
keep more of their money
nobody does that nobody says that your
political instincts have to be beyond
[ __ ] up to think like I'm gonna brag
about a corporate tax cut and regular
people are gonna go isn't that wonderful
no in fact polls show the American
people want to raise taxes on the rich
they want to raise taxes on corporations
so right now corporate profits are at a
record high right now and wages you
there hasn't been a significant increase
in wages since the 1980s
so wages are stagnant corporate profits
are through the roof the rich are doing
better than ever before but dumbass
Trump goes out there and brags like oh
yeah we cut the corporate tax rate from
35 percent to 21 percent that's not
something to brag about
that's something you hide you idiot god
there's so it's like they've been in
their insular far-right bubble they're
corporatist bubble for so long that they
don't even realize that that [ __ ]
doesn't play among the general public
now here's another scary fact
corporations used to pay 33% of the
federal tax burden I believe that's when
you go back to about the 1950s today
they pay 9% of the federal tax burden so
they used to pay 33% now they pay 9% now
that leaves a giant question out there
for us who picks up the slack who picks
up the slack in that situation well the
answer is you you pick up the slack and
that's not conjecture
that's not opinion but that's not me you
know breaking it down in some weird
equation or something no that's look at
their tax plan the Republican tax plan
raises taxes on everybody who makes
$75,000 a year or less over a 10-year
period so whatever tax breaks there are
for working people they expire now some
people say well look that's how you made
the deal I mean what were you gonna do
that's all they could possibly do no
they found a way to make the tax cuts
for corporations in the rich permanent
but whatever tax breaks there are for
the working class they're temporary
that's on purpose in fact it was a great
breakdown of the Republican bill in the
intercept where they explained in no
uncertain terms this is actually the
largest tax increase in US history
because the tax decrease is targeted for
the rich and it's trillions of dollars
of a net tax increase on working class
people so you don't Don you don't brag
about cutting taxes for corporations how
do you not know that oh my god that's so
stupid that's so stupid and then listen
it doesn't you know people they'll say
like oh the wealth is trickling down but
that's not true so first of all only 2%
of people got a bonus as a result of
these tax breaks but that's misleading
because it's not even as a result of
these tax breaks that's what they claim
they'll say oh so many people are
getting bonus
really is unbelievable it's tremendous
well actually no 98% of people did not
get a bonus and of the 2% of people
that's massively misleading to say
because for example we know that unions
have been negotiating to try to get wage
increases for a long time they were
rejected on the wage increase front but
they got a concession and you know AT&T
for example said we'll give you a bonus
so what happened is unions fought for
that behind-the-scenes tooth and nail
for an extended period of time and then
eventually when management caved they
then turn around and go oh the reason
we're doing this is because of the tax
break no it's not but that's corporate
propaganda to try to get politicians to
always fork over money to corporations
in the rich listen if you really want to
help working people you know how you
help working people give the money
directly to working people but they
don't do that they never do that Donald
Trump's not proposing a living wage bill
he's not doing that he's not proposing a
unionization bill which guaranteed would
increase wages across the board for
working people what they do is oh we
need a middleman there of course we need
a middleman so give all the money to the
rich and corporations and then maybe
they'll pass it down well 98% of the
time they did not do it that's a fact
98% of the time but they go oh that's
the s what you do is trickle-down
economics you give it to the rich and
then it'll trickle down to the bottom no
it's not trickling down the bottom
that's the point it's not doing that
over 90% of the money went directly to
stock buybacks which enriches the people
at the top of the companies if you
wanted to raise wages for working people
you just raise wages for working people
that's it but they didn't do that
they'll give it to the rich and then
maybe kind of sort of not really it'll
trickle down to working-class people so
that's the first point is who brags
about cutting the core protection I mean
you so [ __ ] disconnected and this is
why Trump's tax bill had a 33 percent
approval rating because people see
through your garbage propaganda
I mean you are out there lying by the
way about the bill to pretending like oh
this is all for the middle class in the
lower-class that's not true but people
caught on to it that's why only 33
percent of people like your bill only
the people who are the you know I will
never abandon Trump people ever they
believed in him like it's a cult or a
fundamentalist religion those are the
only people who say they like this bill
everybody else is like no this is
terrible
now the second thing is he bragged about
deregulation that might be even more
maddening than bragging about the
corporate tax cuts because we have such
a strong historical record on the
effects of this and it's ugly so for
example in the roaring 20s there was a
lot of deregulation going on a lot of
tax cuts for the rich going on in fact
it was the teens in the 20s you know
leading up to the stock market crash
1929 and then the Great Depression so
this is something we've seen throughout
history over and over and over again cut
taxes for the rich deregulate what you
have is a boom bust cycle in the economy
which means everything takes off we go
oh but yet the good times are never
gonna end this is amazing that's why
they were called the Roaring Twenties
that was like oh yeah this is awesome
and then eventually the bubble burst and
everything plummeted so we're seeing the
exact same thing right now this isn't
steady stable growth this is a bubble
growth fueled by speculation and the
results are gonna be very very damaging
so you're bragging about deregulation
disregarding what happened during the
Great Depression
disregarding what happened under Reagan
everybody acts like Reagan had a great
economic record as soon as he left
office there's the the bubble burst and
there was a giant downturn also Bill
Clinton repealing glass-steagall george
w bush putting a deregulation and
overdrive throughout the 2000s what did
we have oh my god oh my god the market
it's going so high this is so amazing
this is so incredible oh [ __ ] subprime
mortgage crisis Great Recession in 2008
we still haven't recovered from that
whatever recovery there's been the
money's gone to the rich wages have not
increased higher paying jobs were
replaced with lower paying jobs that's
another thing Trump did in this state
you know the unemployment right look at
the unemployment is so wonderful what
he's not telling you is those are higher
wage jobs went away and they were
replaced by lower wage jobs so it's so
misleading to just look at the
unemployment rate and see that's perfect
that's just as misleading
is looking at the market and going see
the markets doing well everything's
great
no the market is more of a reflection on
how the rich are doing and how
corporations are doing and again there's
gonna be there's gonna be a collapse of
the marketplace I don't know what the
catalyst is gonna be it could be any of
a number of things it could be the
totally unregulated multi
trillion-dollar derivatives market it
could be as a result of student loan
debt it could be as a result of credit
card debt it could be the housing market
again there's a million in one ways this
bubble can burst but one thing I can
guarantee you it's gonna burst so buckle
up on that front [ __ ] but to brag about
deregulation when it wasn't even that
long ago it was just ten years ago that
we had the subprime mortgage crisis in
the Great Recession and then the effects
of that lasted to this day we're still
feeling the effects of that in terms of
working people so to brag I mean one of
the things Donald Trump did and
corporate Democrats crossed over to help
him with this is the fewer remaining
provisions of dodd-frank they got rid of
him
the problem with dodd-frank was that it
was too weak not that it was too strong
but they're acting like Oh dodd-frank
it's too strong yeah just get rid of it
Joe Manchin helped with that a bunch of
corporate Democrats up with that
Republicans across the board helped with
that and it's like we have no collective
memory and you would think so Trump
mentions this Oh deregulation isn't that
wonderful no it's terrible we know the
effects of that we know the effects of
that it's like you're taking the refs
out of the game you take the refs out of
the game and it's gonna go there's gonna
be [ __ ] chaos but the Democrats had
nothing to say in response to this and
the media had nothing to say in response
to this in a world that made sense where
you had a media that did its job and an
opposition party that did its job they
wouldn't let this comment go they would
keep hammering him you're bragging about
something that's gonna lead to a giant
giant crash how on earth can you brag
about do you not remember 2008 do you
not remember what was going on I mean
there are no rules for how much
differential companies can leverage
there's no rules for derivatives so you
could do bets on top of bets on top of
side bets and puts and calls and look
goldman sachs
remember when Bernie Sanders said you're
in the campaign their business model was
fraud he said it because it's true so
one of the things they did is they sold
toxic subprime mortgage packages to
unsuspecting clients and said listen
you're gonna make a lot of money if you
invest in these these packages which by
the way were rated triple-a because they
bought the ratings agencies so they got
[ __ ] fake ratings who went to prison
over this nobody went to prison over
this they sold them to their clients
telling them they're gonna make a lot of
money then goldman sachs turned around
and bet on those same products to fail
that's called fraud that's called fraud
so it's like a car salesman sells you a
car goes this is the best car ever it's
got no airbags it's got no seat belts it
breaks down the second you leave the lot
and it explodes and you die inside there
the car salesman who sold you that car
telling you it's awesome that's what
goldman sachs is they know it's foolish
it's a piece of [ __ ] but they sold it
saying it's awesome they're criminals
that's fraud they should all be in
prison but none of them which prison not
only do they not go to prison they got a
bailout not only did they get a bailout
now you have many goldman sachs people
in the [ __ ] white house today because
of Donald Trump so these are criminals
that we're dealing with here and now
they're bragging bragging about
corporate tax cuts bragging about
deregulation goddamnit media where are
you Democrats where are you I mean I
went after CNBC in fact you know who
else did that at Jon Stewart
because CNBC leading up to the subprime
mortgage crisis in the Great Recession
they kept acting like everything's great
and there's gonna be no downturn what so
a network full of so-called financial
experts none of them saw that we were
about to head off a cliff none of them
only one guest on the show a libertarian
economist was like I think there's a
bubble it's going to burst soon
everybody else laughed him out of the
room so an Network full of so-called
financial experts none of them saw we
were in a giant bubble are you [ __ ]
kidding me I was at the time that they
were having these segments I was 19
years old and I was like we're in a
bubble they couldn't see it because
they're the corporate propaganda network
that's what they are they just invite on
the CEOs to say
tell the American people your [ __ ]
now we'll pretend like it's true
that's what CNBC is fox business same
thing so nothing but propaganda and we
had a market totally unregulated and the
effects were disastrous and now it's the
same thing and he's bragging in his
State of the Union about that guy's it's
like we've lost our mind
I feel like between going right back to
the stuff that caused the crash and the
endless war mongering that has never
stopped under any of the administrations
it's like are we are we all just gonna
sit here while we turn this world into
hell on earth is that what we're gonna
do apparently is what we're gonna do
because it's a toothless fake resistance
that the Democrats are doing and the
media is you know they're too busy
conspiracy mongering you're talking
about Russia talking about the fact that
Donald Trump said [ __ ] hole that you
know the new one is they're talking
about some [ __ ] memo and the FBI and
all it is is you know it's amazing I
noticed it today as I'm reading through
all the tweets about it it's like CNN
and MSNBC and all the domain shows Fox
News as well but from the other
perspective they cover everything like
it's a soap opera and then Devon Nunez
said this oh yeah but what about what
about James coming why are you [ __ ]
there taking it really important issues
macro issues policy substance issues and
they go sweep that under the rug and
let's just talk about the personality
angle of this and the he-said she-said
angle this and let's make it like a
[ __ ] soap opera well then you suck at
your job if you want to if you want to
act like you know you're covering a soap
opera go cover a soap opera go create a
show where you like you know talking
dead you know how they have that for the
walking dead talking soap opera go
[ __ ] talk about the soap operas after
they're on air go create a show to do
that why are you you're not serious
people these are people who are supposed
to be reporters and journalists who know
about the details of the policies and
they can educate the American people and
tell the America what's going on in
Washington
that's not happening so it's just it's
sick it's sick and you know you should
never let this guy get away with
bragging about corporate tax cuts at a
time when they already have record
profits and working people are
struggling bragging about deregulation
when we know that's gonna it just
guarantee that the next crash comes
sooner we're so far away from basic
sanity that I feel like I have no hope
what's up [ __ ] has everybody doing
we're doing our third livestream this is
not secular talking smack like it was
the last few times what I'm gonna do is
a as you could tell from the title is a
little preview of what to expect for
Trump's State of the Union so I'll break
that down for you and then however long
that takes I don't know maybe 30 minutes
or so is my guess but could go longer
could go shorter but then perhaps I'll
take some super chats from you guys you
know I should mention that I spoke to
some people about the super chats after
the fact and they were like yeah there's
no way to really guarantee that they all
stay up apparently they go away after
like 2 or 3 minutes which i think is
ridiculous cuz that's like I can't I
just simply can't keep up with that so
anyway I apologize if I missed some
super chats the last time around but you
know if we get to super chat today which
I think we will little later I'll do my
best to answer the questions as fast as
humanly possible and hopefully answer
more of your questions although I'm
pretty sure I'll miss many more so I'll
jump into I'll jump into that in a
second into the breakdown of the State
of the Union I do realize that at this
moment that I'm live I'm competing with
with the Emperor God king known as
Jordan Peterson over on Joe Rogan's
channel so I don't expect as many people
to be listening to this although we have
crop I think we have some crossover fans
myself and Joe Rogan but believe it or
not I think what there's even some
crossover fans between me and Jordan
Peterson which is a little surprising
because you know I'm not the biggest fan
of his and I'm pretty sure he's not the
biggest fan of me so um it's a little
weird that we have crossover fans but
hey whatever to each their own
I am entering on the back end here in
the control room I see that you guys are
chatting away in the live chat that's
wonderful so don't don't hit me with
super chats yet at least at this very
second because if you do I'm gonna miss
it so I'm gonna go ahead and start my
breakdown and I'm gonna tell you guys
exactly what you can expect during Trump
State of the Union now first of all let
me just say even though I despise Trump
with every fiber of my being and he's a
danger to the world and I consider all
that stuff relatively relatively obvious
you can't lie that the idea of a trump
State of the Union is a little bit
exciting I feel dirty and gross saying
that but I really think that's true I
mean the guy is I don't even know the
right word for it he's just a wild man
he seemingly talks off-the-cuff and he's
got that fake straight shooter thing
going on and he certainly generates a
lot of media attention but this I expect
this to be a bonanza okay so first of
all what is what are Trump's main themes
gonna be well it shouldn't surprise you
that probably his biggest theme is gonna
be the market and unemployment this is
something that you know if you follow
him on Twitter you'll realize that it's
basically his response to everything but
his response to pretty much everything
at this point is oh yeah well the
markets doing tremendous believe me the
markets to on unbelievable I have to
just tell you and the unemployment rate
like for example jay-z was criticizing
him over the weekend I did I think he
did an interview on CNN with Van Jones
and you know Trump responded like oh
yeah well the black unemployment rate is
the lowest it's ever been so how about
that unbelievable now what's annoyed me
about this is the response from many
Democrats and the response from people
who are basically neo liberals they
respond by saying oh no you have to give
Obama credit for the
unemployment rate among black people
today and you know I think that they
just fundamentally don't care enough
about the issues to dive deeper into
into something like this but the reality
is the response from people on the Left
when Trump brags about the low
unemployment rate should be the
unemployment rate is not a very good
measure of the health of the economy
it's just not so yes we have a low
unemployment rate today but these are
not high paying jobs so you know this is
what happened with the subprime mortgage
crisis in the Great Recession people
lost higher paying jobs and then when
there was a bounce back first of all
most of the benefits went to the top one
percent in the rebound in the recession
but for everybody else even if they got
a job they got a lower paying job so you
know the idea of like harping away on
the unemployment rate as if that's like
you know oh my god it's so great that
this thing is low no you need the
details as to what exactly are those
jobs and how well are people doing so
the stock market and the unemployment
rate those are not the best economic
indicators of how your average American
is doing in fact there's some of the
worst indicators of how your average
American is doing I'm gonna draw an
analogy here that's gonna sound a little
ridiculous but I'm saying it because
it's true you can have a situation where
you have a 0% unemployment rate you know
how you do that slavery so everybody
who's not working oh we're gonna it's
gonna be forced labor and then you could
turn around and go back
look we don't we don't even have
unemployment in this country isn't that
wonderful no because again what matters
is what are those jobs and unfortunately
the job growth that we've had it's all
in the low-wage it's all in low-wage
industries so it's just sad to see that
the response from Democrats is so weak
it's such a weak response to say oh the
low unemployment rate yeah that's great
but it's Obama who gave us that no stop
the response is you're focusing on the
unemployment rate Donald Trump because
that's the best thing you can
- because you can't account for the fact
that all these jobs are low wage jobs
and income inequality is that a record
high right now so it annoys me that you
know you have this paradigm where people
are responding in an ineffectual way
that actually helps Trump because then
people are gonna roll their eyes and go
okay so we're gonna give Obama credit
for this one Trump's been in for over a
year and he's done different economic
policies so look for Trump to talk about
the unemployment rate he's gonna do that
and look for Trump to brag about the
market my guess is he's gonna bring up
the record a number of or he claims it's
a record number of highs for the Dow
since he's been in office but again
what's the response to this the response
is we're in a [ __ ] bubble we're in a
bubble this isn't real growth so you had
the subprime mortgage crisis in the
Great Recession then the government just
reinflates that bubble they bailed out
Wall Street they did the stimulus and
you haven't had an increase in wages for
the middle class from the 1980s and
onward so we are in a gigantic bubble
people forget that leading up to the
Great Depression
it wasn't like Oh everything is stable
and steady and we're all happy it was oh
my god we're [ __ ] riding a tsunami
wave and the good times are never gonna
end and that's why they called him the
roaring 20s is cuz the market was
booming and everything is great isn't is
awesome and then boom there was a giant
crash stock market crash in 1929
followed by the Great Depression again
you saw similar trends in the 2000s
leading up to the subprime mortgage
crisis in the Great Recession in 2008
we're right back in a gigantic bubble
and it drives me [ __ ] crazy that
again the response from the Democrats is
oh no we need to give Obama credit for
the great economy that we have now no
the answer is it's not a [ __ ] great
economy it's not a great economy you
have corporate profits are at a record
high but again you haven't had an
increase in wages for the middle class
from the 1980s
so don't the problem is the Democrats
always agree to the framework the
Republicans set up and then try to argue
on their grounds
the real answer is you bust up the
framework and say your whole paradigm in
the whole way you're measuring this is
incorrect I don't give a [ __ ] that we're
in a bubble that's a bad thing I'd
rather have steady stable growth where
you have strong unions a living wage and
you have policies that are good for the
workers but no we deregulating like
[ __ ] crazy now going right back to
the same policies that caused the crash
in the first place and so again this is
what Trump's gonna do he's gonna brag
about the market he's gonna brag about
unemployment even though the market is
not an indicator of how your average
person is doing it's an indicator of how
the rich are doing and an indicator of
how corporations are doing and the
unemployment rate that's a misleading
thing to talk about because again
doesn't matter if the unemployment rate
is low but all the jobs are paying a
pathetically low wage which is the exact
situation that we have right now but
again you're not gonna hear a good
response from the Democrats on that
front and the market and unemployment
will be two main things that Donald
Trump talks about he's gonna hammer away
on those issues okay the next thing he's
gonna do is he'll bring up the bonuses
that some companies are paying out as a
result of the tax bill now again this is
massively misleading the Republicans
have a really good PR machine and
marketing machine so they get people to
believe their [ __ ] but the reality
is first of all ninety-eight percent of
workers saw no benefit from Trump's tax
bill and two percent did of those two
percent that did again this is something
you have to dive into the specifics of
for example in the case of AT&T they
said oh it's because of Trump's giant
tax cut that we're gonna give our
workers a bonus well guess what when you
research it you find out no the the
unions negotiated with AT&T to get that
and then after the fact the management
at AT&T goes oh no we're doing this
because of the great tax bill it was
just passed so this is what's called
propaganda you had a hard-fought victory
by the union's but what's given credit
is the far right wing
policies that just hand more money over
to the corporation's another thing is
well over 90 percent of the benefits are
going to stock buybacks so in other
words people who are the executives at
all these different corporations are
taking the benefits of this tax bill and
giving themselves more money that's
that's the gist of it
furthermore we already know that I think
it's 82 percent of the benefits of
Trump's tax bill goes to the top one
percent everybody who makes $75,000 a
year or less will see a net tax increase
over the next ten years
so whatever middle class benefits there
are in the bill are temporary but what's
permanent the corporate tax cut for
example Acuff from 35% to 21% um the
estate tax is another thing the a giant
cut in the estate tax originally they
wanted to eliminate it but they gave a
little bit of ground on that it used to
be if you have five million dollars
worth of wealth or more you get hit by
the estate tax now it's 11 million
dollars or more so this is just it's
just to give away to the rich that's all
it is that's all it is and you have a
giant PR machine on the right that spins
it and tries to pretend like no this is
great for workers well here's a radical
idea if you actually cared about workers
instead of giving the corporations and
the rich money and hoping that it
trickles down to the workers you could
have just done a policy where you gave
the workers the money but they didn't do
that and they didn't do that because
they're not for the workers again it's
there's always all we got to do with the
middleman I've give it to the rich
people and give it to the corporations
and then it will maybe trickle down well
no if you really wanted to give it to
the workers ok make the minimum wage a
living wage that helps a lot do card
check or other pro union legislation
bans so-called right-to-work laws if you
were to do that then you would be giving
the benefits directly to the middle
class you could have done you know you
could have given them a gigantic tax cut
made it permanent but they didn't do
that again you'd net raise taxes on
everybody who make seventy five thousand
dollars a year or less over the next ten
years so what he's gonna do is he's
gonna have really misleading examples
and help you point to a certain
corporation
and say oh my god it everything is so
great and isn't this great for the
workers even though I just gave you the
facts and it's not great for the workers
but I'll have a few misleading examples
and he'll hammer away on those
misleading examples so this is this is
how he's gonna build his case on
economics he's gonna focus on the market
the unemployment rate and the effects of
the tax bill but it will all be skewed
it will all be misleading it'll all miss
the higher picture
I mean imagine that the bigger picture I
should say imagine I mean we live in a
country where half of workers make
thirty thousand dollars a year or less
you're gonna have Trump go out there and
try to make the case like know things
things are actually [ __ ] wonderful
that's and and workers or I mean workers
are really getting help under my
administration that's just complete
naught or nonsense and by the way only
33 percent of the American people even
supported Trump's tax plan even with the
[ __ ] just just tsunami of propaganda
in its favor
i reference tsunamis twice let's try to
go up with a different one i was like
[ __ ] we're going with tsunami okay so
that's his economic case another thing
he's gonna do is he'll he's gonna brag
about isis being defeated what he's not
gonna tell you of course is isis they
actually are in shambles at the moment
but that's not because of the US at all
that's actually because of the Kurds the
the Kurds were on the ground fighting
back against Isis vociferously you have
the Syrian army exact same thing they've
been fighting back against Isis you have
the Iraqi army and you have Shia
militias so Trump is gonna make it so
that the United States takes credit for
hard-fought victories from people in the
region and that is [ __ ] really
frustrating really frustrating because
not only did for example - Deker were
the Kurds largely responsible for what
happened with Isis but now we're sitting
by idly and allowing Turkey to destroy
the same Kurds that just really took it
to ice
it it's infuriating so Washington is
gonna take credit Donald Trump is gonna
take credit and they're gonna bolster
these neocon policies he's gonna make
the case that you know I have destroyed
Isis Isis is in shambles and it is
unbelievable it is tremendous and he'll
be propping up neoconservative policies
in the process arguing that intervention
is good when of course we wasted
trillions of dollars in the Middle East
Trump used to point that out to all we
wasted trillions of dollars why don't we
just rebuild our infrastructure here at
home this is crazy but no now Trump is
bombing he took us from bombing seven
countries to eight countries he
increased drone strikes four hundred and
thirty two percent State Department just
announced the other day we're staying in
Syria indefinitely so he's gonna try to
bolster these interventionist policies
and argue all it's obviously a good
thing look Isis is in shambles don't
talk about the Syrian army don't talk
about them and by the way we also bomb
the Syrian government a few times their
air base if you remember that he's gonna
say don't
he won't mention it but it there will be
a clear argument there of don't give
credit to the Syrian army don't give
credit to the Iraqi army don't give
credit to the Kurds we're gonna take
credit for it and we're gonna use this
as an argument for further intervention
he's also going to and this one is
probably gonna be one of the grosser
parts of the speech although it's all
gross he's gonna talk about people
who've been impacted by gang violence to
justify his immigration policies so and
and he'll use an old trick that
Republicans have used for a while but
he's kind of put front and center a lot
more he's gonna use people who are
Hispanic as and say look they're victims
of gang violence from illegal immigrants
therefore isn't it awesome that we're
doing a massive crackdown on
undocumented immigrants that's the
argument that's gonna be made and I know
that because they I think it was NBC
News released a list of people who Trump
invited to the speech through he's gonna
point to you know how this is what
presidents do they'll give their say the
Union appoint 200 and this person and
they tell a little story anecdote about
that person and then everybody collapse
and that he's gonna do that with people
of color
who had an experience where a loved one
or something was murdered or hurt by
another undocumented immigrant and the
underlying argument is going to be we
really should be deporting all these
undocumented immigrants as a result of
the fact that some of them are criminals
and of course he will never acknowledge
and people on the right never
acknowledge the fact that not just
immigrants but also undocumented
immigrants a lower percentage of them
are criminals than the population this
is that amazing because you hear
oftentimes these arguments coming from
people like Trump like oh yeah I mean
the only reason we're against them is
because the [ __ ] they're bad people
and they're criminals that's why we're
against and we got some bad hombres here
but they'll never talk about the macro
statistics on the fact that the u.s.
population in general there are more
criminals among citizens than immigrants
and undocumented immigrants so you know
what they're gonna do it's it's cheap
demagoguery and of course he would never
bring up the fact that if you really
want to stop gang violence you end the
drug war if you end the drug war I mean
that is a [ __ ] machete to the throat
of criminal activity in the United
States because if you legalize tax and
regulate drugs basically what you do is
put the drug cartels out of business
over time and if you put the drug
cartels out of business there's gonna be
a lot less crime and violence because a
lot of the criminal activity is directly
related to the black market of drugs see
if there's a dispute now because drugs
are illegal it's settled in the street
with guns if there's a dispute when you
have legal taxed and regulated marijuana
well guess what you go to court and you
wear suits and ties and you figure it
out like civilized people and we know
this is the case because look at what
happened with prohibition when we had
prohibition of alcohol crime shot up as
a result that's when you had the Mafia
get really really powerful and organized
crime get really powerful well the same
thing is happening now with prohibition
of other drugs so he's going to act like
the way to stop gang violence is to
deport all these undocumented immigrants
when in reality the way to stop gang
violence is to legalize tax and regulate
the intercept has a superb article out
by Lee Fong and Ryan Grimm and it's
called the dead Enders candidates who
signed up to battle Donald Trump must
get past the Democratic Party first so
what they do is they Chronicle what
populist left candidates have had to go
through in order to try to gain support
from the Democratic Party now you would
think right up front well hold on now
the Republicans won in a landslide
you know they control every level of
government and well the answer is clear
we ran our center-right candidate last
time in Hillary Clinton she lost well we
got to move left now we tried
center-right we've been trying
center-right we lost a thousand seats
under Obama we lost the White House with
Hillary Clinton so obviously we move
left now you would think that that's the
logical answer right no that's they go I
don't care about logic we have a
responsibility to our donors so we're
going to keep running Republican like
candidates that will renew
now I'm not gonna go through every
example that they give in the article
because there's just endless examples in
the article I'm gonna leave the article
in the video description box you can
read through it all yourself if you'd
like but I do want to give you one
example so you get an idea what's really
going on just King is a superb candidate
running in Pennsylvania's 16th district
in fact she's a justice Democrat and
she's endorsed by virtually every
grassroots Left organization for clear
reasons that you're as you're about to
see so here's what they say about her in
June one of their own talking about
left-wing groups Jess King who heads a
nonprofit that helps struggling women
start and run small businesses in the
area announced that she would be running
to take out Republican representative
Lloyd Schmucker in Pennsylvania's 16th
district Nick Martin her field director
and another co-founder of Lancaster
stands up again left left-wing group was
a leading activist in the popular and
robust a local anti pipeline movement an
organized Network King was able to tap
into she planned to focus a populist
progressive campaign on canvassing and
harnessing grassroots enthusiasm if
suburban
came along attracted by the promise of
Medicare for all or tuition free public
college then great but they would not be
Kings target she's targeting the base
Lancaster stands up voted to endorse
King as did a local immigrant rights
group with a broad grassroots network
make the road Pennsylvania Justice
Democrats a small dollar operation that
was backing leftist Democrats got behind
her as well the primary is set for May
15th with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
ruling on Monday that the GOP had
illegally gerrymandered the state's
congressional districts insisting they
be redrawn before the primary the
decision could cut either way for King
depending on the shape of the new map
King then sought to secure the
endorsement of the major players in the
Democratic Party circles in Democratic
Party circles her campaign reached out
to Emily's list which was founded to
elect pro-choice women to Congress
Emily's list sent King a questionnaire
which she filled out and returned
affirming her strong support for
reproductive freedom that was October by
which point her campaign had broken the
$100,000 mark a sign of viability she
had hoped would show Emily's list that
she was serious we followed up a few
times after and she did not hear and she
excuse me we followed up a few times
after and did not hear back said King
spokesperson Guido George NT it turned
out the Democratic Party had other ideas
or at least it had an old idea as is
happening in races across the country
party leaders in Washington and in the
Pennsylvania district rallied instead
around a candidate who in 2016 had a
raised more money than a Democrat ever
had in the district and suffered a
humiliating loss anyway okay so do you
understand what happened you have a
grassroots candidate rise up she has the
support of all the grassroots
organizations she's been involved in
left-wing movements for a long time
everybody's like oh my god what a great
candidate and she's running on Medicare
for all in free college and a living
wage
so what this is awesome this is all we
have the perfect candidate and we we
know we're gonna win here but as soon as
she asked the major Democratic players
that are tied to the leadership of the
Democratic Party hey can we get your
guy's endorsement - look we have all the
endorsement of all the populist left
organizations they're full of activists
that are doing the hard work on the
ground they go oh yeah totally well
we're gonna forgive us we'll think about
it and then maybe we'll get back to you
or something yeah that's great dude are
you running whoo-hoo then what do they
do they literally don't even give her a
call back to tell her hey we're not
gonna endorse you they don't do that
what they do is they pick and prop up a
corporate Democrat who already ran in
the last election broke the fundraising
record and got their ass handed to them
now why are they doing that why did they
say ho we'll go with the Republican like
candidate instead of just king and
endorse them well the answer there's two
reasons number one Jess King is not
running his Republican light she's
running as a Bernie Sanders style
politician she's a crusader for populist
left ideas she totally supports
reproductive choice of course of course
so when you fill out the emily's list
thing they say oh is this do you agree
with us on the issue issues she's like
yes
and they're like great we don't like you
go away or they don't even respond to
her call and say they're gonna endorse
her they don't even say hey we're not
gonna do it you're gonna go in this
other direction they just finally brush
you off we don't care about you because
you're actually grass roots are actually
populist left not only are you for
reproductive choice but you're also for
Medicare for all free college a living
wage on those issues we're not
necessarily with you because we're tied
to a Republican leadership Republican
leadership is tied to big money donors
big money donors don't want those
policies so the actual left-wing
politician who would win no we're gonna
go with the shitty Republican light
politician who has a good chance of
losing cuz they already lost when they
broke the fundraising record so the two
reasons why they're not going
just king number one she's not running
as Republican Lite and number two in
fact I'll let them explain it in the
article listen to this
the way to win party support Democratic
Party support is to pass what's called
the phone test in order to establish
whether a person is worthy of official
backing d-triple-c operatives will quote
rolodex a candidate according to a
source familiar with the procedure on
the most basic level it involves
candidates being asked to pull out their
smartphones scroll through their contact
lists and add up the amount of money
their contacts could raise or contribute
to their campaigns if the candidates
contacts aren't good for at least two
hundred and fifty thousand dollars or in
some cases much more they fail the test
and party support goes elsewhere okay
stop let's reflect here the situation
with the Democratic Party is way worse
than even I thought I knew it was bad I
was the one sounding the alarm from a
long time ago it's even worse than I
thought this is this is unconscionable
this is insufferable I mean think about
that who the [ __ ] can grab their phone
and just through the contactless raise
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
here's your answer nobody the top one
percent maybe the top point 0.1% that's
it so what they're saying is no no it is
a requirement that you are an elitist to
run as a Democrat it's a requirement
that you're a corporatist
to run as a Democrat listen I
I run secular talk showed us pretty well
doesn't it you know how much money I to
raise if I went through my [ __ ] phone
to try to
raise money for a campaign probably less
than $1,000 and my mom would be giving
500 so what they're saying is policy is
irrelevant policy doesn't matter at all
do you have big money connections they
literally prioritize big money
connections before anything involving
policy and they wonder why they lose
they lost the Donald Trump guys this is
why you [ __ ] lose to Donald Trump
you know they lost a thousand seats
under Barack Obama Nancy Pelosi Chuck
Schumer the leaders of the Democrat they
lost a thousand seats why because all
their candidates are like this Hillary
Clinton lost to Donald Trump why cuz
she's like this let me give you some
platitudes in some cliches break down
the barriers stronger together we don't
hate minorities yay and it was like okay
oh I'm so inspiring they don't want
people who are in favor of Medicare for
all in free college and a living wage
and a new New Deal and end the wars and
legalize marijuana they don't care about
their litmus test is not o are you in
favor of these hallmark policies that
you need to support in order to win
because they're overwhelmingly popular
and this is a democracy no their litmus
test is can you raise $250,000 by just
going through your phone
this is beyond disgusting and the
Democratic Party is even worse than I
thought this is as bad as it gets men
this as bad as it gets
you have guys oh my god they're
responsible for Donald Trump they're
responsible you have a populist left
candidate who has a massive grassroots
support activists are supporting them
everybody's like yes just King yes
awesome gets all the the good people
small money donors who care about the
issues and are fighting on the issues
they all support of the people support
her the corporate Democratic Party
elitist Democratic party goes we're not
even gonna give you the courtesy of a
response call to let you know that we're
not picking you we're just gonna go with
this Republican like candidate who
already lost because they're that
beholden to donors to big-money donors
so here you have it man
this is as damning as it gets the
Democratic Party they have two
requirements for you to run for them you
have to be Republican light and they go
on to explain that in more detail
Democratic leaders are like okay yes you
have to abandon your base in order to
get the suburban moderate Republican
voters to vote for you that's what they
say the the Republican the people who
are socially liberal but fiscally
conservative abandon your base for those
people so the two requirements are you
have to be a Republican light and you
have to be able you have to be a
corporatist and an elitist and be able
to raise two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars from looking at your from going
through your contacts in your phone this
is even worse than I thought it's worse
than I thought it's worse than I thought
[Music]
this is what gives us Trump this is what
gives us the Republican because there's
no there's no opposition the Republicans
have a vision it's the worst vision in
the world but it's a vision what are we
in favor of [ __ ] immigrants build the
wall scapegoat immigrants for all your
problems endless war all that stuff and
when you give people the option of a
Republican or Republican light they
always choose Republican why not give
them a different option somebody who's
populist left somebody who represents
what a Democrat is supposed to represent
ending the wars legalize marijuana new
New Deal living wage Medicare for all
free college nope because if you're for
those things you're pissing off the
donors and they I just showed you how
they prioritize the donors over the
policies so you have to be Republican
light you have to be a corporatist and
an elitist and you have to sell out to
big-money donors that's a requirement in
the Democratic Party listen to me listen
to me you have to support these
candidates Jeff King you know listen I'm
not affiliated with justice Democrats
anymore I'm not but if I would have
conversation with Jess King what I would
say is this is where we open a two-front
war Jess now many people who run Jess
King is a good person
the Justice Democrats are good people so
oftentimes their instinct is the
opposite of that their instinct is like
you know we try to [ __ ] play nice
with the Democrats but go after the
Republicans and I would say no this is
where we open a two-front war the whole
purpose of your campaign now I don't
want to hear you talk for five minutes
without mentioning the fact every time
you talk you need to bring up the
establishment of the Republican Party
hates us and the establishment of the
Democratic Party hates us because we're
gonna represent the people of both
parties we're gonna represent all
Americans and push for the policies that
all Americans agree with including
Medicare for all and free college and a
living wage and they hate me the
establishment Democrats hate me despise
me the elitist corporatist Democrats
hate me I would take a [ __ ] chainsaw
to the Democratic Party I would say
they're part of the [ __ ] problem look
at what's going on here look what's
going on here I don't want their support
that's what you say you open a two-front
war you fight the establishment of the
Republican Party and you fight the
establishment of the Democratic Party
you say I don't want your [ __ ]
support emily's list I did when I
thought you were decent people now I
know you're not decent people now I know
you don't even care about the issues you
say you care about you don't care about
reproductive choice I'm better on
reproductive choice than the Republican
Lite candidate you are backing so you're
frauds you're fraud you're elitist
you're corporatists so I don't want
anything to do with you I despise the
establishment of the Republican Party
and the Democratic Party I'm here to
represent the people the Democratic
Party needs to shape up and do their
goddamn job and start representing the
people but they're not doing it so I
want everybody to vote for me because
I'm gonna take on the establishment of
both parties I'm gonna take on this
corrupt government and I'm gonna fight
for the people I don't care about name
recognition or party I care about
fighting for the people that's what I'm
here to do so you don't see this is the
this is where many people who are good
candidates they slip up because they
want to play nice with people who are
supposed to be on their side the groups
but no when they snub you this bad when
they expose how corrupt they are an
elitist thing
and they don't even care about the
issues they say they care about that's
when you take out the [ __ ] chainsaw
and swing it at their face so if I was
affiliated with justice Democrats still
I would get in contact with Jess King
and let her know this is this is your
strategy moving forward and then you win
and then you win because that's when you
get even more grassroots support Bernie
Sanders to this day goes out there and
says the Democratic Party is a failure
and here's what they need to do to be
better
Weerd the one politician in the United
States of America who openly shits on
both political parties is the most
popular politician in America what does
that tell you tells you people despise
the parties and on some level they know
how corrupt they are they might not be
able to explain in detail how that's the
case but they know they're [ __ ]
corrupt because they're not representing
them so your job is to go out there and
destroy both parties with your arguments
and use policy to get people to donate
you so I'm gonna leave Jess Kings her
website where you can make a donation to
her campaign I'm gonna leave that in the
video description box please do it
because look at how much it's biased
against populist left candidates if
populist left candidates don't sweep in
the upcoming election it's not because
the American people don't want them it's
because their campaigns were crushed
crushed by big-money crushed by the
establishment Republicans crushed by the
corporate Democrats that's the only way
we can lose is if they don't hear our
message because when people hear our
message they agree with us
so virtually all of you know this by now
but guess what happened a few days ago
Democrats caved on the spending bill in
government shutdown they caved so if you
remember the one thing that they were
asking for
they started the debate by asking for
one thing that was the the whole debate
was just okay we understand that you're
the Republican Party you're in control
the government from top to bottom we
don't know what the [ __ ] were doing as
Democrats so can you please please
please please please just give us
protection for the dreamers which over
80% of the American people want please
please please and then the Republicans
said no well the government's back open
so obviously the Republicans gave an
inch at the very least they gave a
centimeter or a millimeter or else the
government would still be closed right
no they gave nothing the exact same
thing that Mitch McConnell was offering
the day before the government shutdown
is the exact same thing that the
Democrats got after the government
shutdown they didn't even get protection
for the dreamers they were asking for
one thing they didn't get it you know
what they got a verbal commitment from
Mitch McConnell which by the way is
worth so much he's the the most disliked
politician in the United States of
America that's a literal nobody trusts
them nobody likes him he has a track
record of being a far-right lunatic
who's unwilling to compromise who's
unwilling to bend on anything but
Chuckie Schumer got a verbal commitment
from Mitch McConnell that at some point
in the future Daka would come up for a
vote they didn't even say oh we're gonna
guarantee you know X amount of
Republican votes so hey it's probably
gonna pass because look how many people
that we have that are gonna support it
didn't say any of that
I guarantee that at some point in the
future there will be a vote on Dhaka
where it may be passes or it doesn't and
Chuck Schumer's like okay that's fine
let's uh let's go in that direction
[Music]
now there's an NBC News Paul there's a
new NBC new News poll 39% of Americans
now say that the Democrats deserve the
lion's share of the blame for the
government shutdown
38% blame Trump and the GOP so the
American people it's it's by a slim
one-point margin within the margin of
error so it's really a wash here but the
America people go yeah okay it's kind of
the Democrats fault that's why we had
the shutdown I need you to understand
that the Democrats were plus 20 points
five days ago
on the shutdown so in other words every
poll showed oh if the government shuts
down it's gonna be the fault of the
Republicans because the Republicans
control the House the Senate and the and
obviously the presidency so the
government shuts down it's on then
clearly the Democrats were plus 20
points then the government shuts down
you know you have Chuck Schumer showing
the spine of a jellyfish and then the
weakness is so overwhelming that the
American people go oh gross yeah anyway
it's like a 50/50 I don't know it's it
looks like it's both their faults for
the government shutting down it's not
the Republicans fault maybe he's 50/50
something so in other words all of the
[ __ ] marketing and messaging that
the Republicans started doing right when
the shutdown happened it worked it
worked the Democrats had a 20-point lead
going into a shutdown but then the
Republicans took to Twitter Paul Ryan
and you know Mitch McConnell and the
Republicans went out on the end
Trump and the Republicans went out on
the shows on TV and they said hashtag
Schumer shut down Schumer shut down
Schumer shut down Schumer shut down
that's what this is is the Democrats
fault as the Democrats Falls the
Democrats fault is the Democrats fault
it's the Democrats fault and then when
you repeat something enough people
eventually shrug and go okay I guess and
that's what happened here now how much
did you hear the Democrats saying in
that in that time frame when the
shutdown was happening did you hear them
say anything I didn't hear them say much
in fact the only arguments I heard
coming out of the Democrats is oh we
gave Trump everything he wanted what
what so the Republican marketing is I'm
gonna drop an anvil on your head
blame you for everything and I'm gonna
continue hammering at home even after
Schumer caved Trump took a victory lap
on Twitter Democrats caved a Democrat
scape weak spineless you had you know
rubbing it in like oh god you guys suck
at that I'm gonna rub it in your face a
little bit
everything about this Democratic Party
is screams weakness
it's beyond pathetic what we're
witnessing I've never seen that before
you had a 20-point advantage going into
a shutdown where people were going to
blame the Republicans but you didn't say
anything during the shutdown you didn't
remind people hey Trump shut down
Republicans shut down they control every
level of government here hey why don't
the Republicans come out there and tell
you why they're against the policy that
over 80% of the American people are in
favor of even a majority of Republicans
want to support the dreamers why don't
they tell you they don't they don't say
cuz they don't know how to market they
don't know how to message they don't
know how to make their [ __ ] case they
don't know how to keep the pressure on
and so they just ended up [ __ ]
withering away and caving they turned a
giant advantage into a disadvantage
imagine if the Republicans had a policy
where over 80% of the American
or with them you wouldn't be able to get
them off TV you wouldn't be able to
prevent them from telling you eight
times a day oh by the way America people
are with me they're not with the
Democrats
hey Democrats why are you tyrants why
are you fascist trying to override the
will of the American people I thought
this was supposed to be a representative
democracy what's going on here but the
Democrats have a gigantic advantage over
80% of them with over 80% of the
American crafts and protecting dreamers
and what do you hear me we gave you
everything you want mr. president and
yes maybe the shutdown is our fault
Oh God so here's the best line of the
article I want to show you Schumer and
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi
believed they had a deal in September
that would exchange protection
protections for dreamers for more border
security as long as that did not include
funding for Trump's promised border wall
Trump later said that no such deal had
been struck and the White House released
a long list of 70 demands including the
border wall that the administration
required in exchange for protecting
dreamers you see what the Republicans do
they go oh you want one thing one thing
that over 80% of the American people
agree on okay we'll consider giving you
that one thing here's a list of 70
things you have to give me mind you the
70 things that the Republicans are
asking for across the board they pull it
less than 50% the colossal position of
strength that the Democrats had is
indescribable I mean you can give a
middle schooler with no training in
politics the same scenario and they'd be
like oh [ __ ] thank you
this is great so let me teach the
Democrats a little something here if
they're all asking you for 70 things in
return for one thing why not turn the
tables on them and say oh that's nice
now here's my
140 demands to get a single Democratic
vote a single Democratic vote you're not
gonna get a [ __ ] single Democratic
vote unless you give me 140 things now
listen at the end of the day are you
gonna get a hundred for snot but when
you negotiate from a position of
strength if you it what's the old saying
if you shoot for the stars you might
reach the moon right oh I'm gonna shoot
for the stars they're really [ __ ] far
out there I didn't get to the stars but
I got to the moon see this is why we
were saying from day one the Democrats
position should be here's what's gonna
happen you are gonna give us protection
for the dreamers you are gonna give us
chip the children's health insurance
program funding you're gonna give us net
neutrality you're gonna give us a
guarantee that there's no cuts to Social
Security or Medicare you're gonna give
us full funding for Puerto Rico because
they're US territory and they were
obliterated by a hurricane and they're
sitting there some of them still don't
even have [ __ ] power you're gonna
give us I'm just getting started
but there are five things you will not
get a single Democratic vote until you
give us every one of those things now
when they try to go buh-buh-buh but you
go every one of those things I just told
you polls over 60 percent in fact here I
will show you the polls I'll give you
the exact number for each one now so if
you're against fine if you're not in
favor of giving us anything things fine
now you're gonna have to go explain to
the American people why it is that over
60% of them can piss off you're gonna
have to explain to them why in a
representative democracy you refuse to
represent them you say no I'm not going
to do the things that are overwhelmingly
popular and by the way I'm gonna try to
do things that are not popular at all
you have to go out there and do that if
I if I was one of the Democrats oh my
god I'd be so insufferable and smug and
I'd be so unbearable I'd be on every
show I could get on on on you know the
sunday talk shows I'd be all over
Twitter I would have made people go okay
okay I get it this is a trump shut down
and a Republican shutdown and the
Republicans want to do policies
everybody hates and you want to do
policies everybody's for and if you
fight really really really hard
eventually it would be a no brainer of
course you would get [ __ ] daca of
course you would absolutely of course
you would get chip by the way
they were bragging cuz chip was given to
them for six years six years if you did
ship for ten years you save billions of
dollars it's a program then that saves
the government money and it's health
health insurance for children what the
[ __ ] oh god they're so embarrassing
they're so pathetic and okay you ready
for this I haven't even gotten to the
the most important part so this was the
original agreement
okay look well Chuck Schumer goes crying
to the Republicans okay I guess maybe
we'll give you everything you want will
reopen the government and they did a fun
you know they funded the government for
I don't know three weeks or some
ridiculous small timeframe like that
but guess what the Republicans already
reneged on the plan to do a clean DREAM
Act down the road look they caved again
the Democrats caved again okay I know
that we said that under the deal to
reopen the government we will you'll
you'll do a DREAM Act later but you
don't even have to do that we can just
drop the DREAM Act thing completely and
maybe we'll get a budget deal are you
kidding me
are you kidding me and you know the
Democrats genuinely think like no we're
gonna come out of this thing looking
good because you know what this shows we
are moderate and bipartisan and we like
to in compromise every single person on
the Left who was invigorated and is
ready like yeah let's go get the
Republicans yeah let's make sure we go
vote for Democrats in order to you know
take the country back every single one
of them thought well obviously the
reason we would vote for Democrats is
because they're willing to fight for us
for our position well now everybody in
the country who
gives a [ __ ] about the dreamers
everybody in the country who gives a
[ __ ] about the issue of immigration they
go why would I go vote for the Democrats
now at the end of the day you give the
Republicans exactly what they want
anyway I'm picking you because you are
supposed to fight for us if you cave the
first time they make a peep even though
over 80% of the American people are with
you then what the [ __ ] is the point of
me going to vote for you there is no
point in me doing that it's a waste of
[ __ ] time they've Democrats are so
stupid they think they're doing some
sort of you know they're playing chess
and like oh we just got the Republicans
because by giving them exactly what they
wanted at some point down the road
something happens and then maybe somehow
magically we end up getting what we want
no you keep losing because you're losers
you don't win by losing you win by
winning but they abandoned immediately
they abandoned and to be clear this is
more the Senate Democrats in the House
Democrats although some House Democrats
are weak as [ __ ] too but they were
reported in the house they're like what
the [ __ ] what are you doing you have
over 80% of the American people with you
and you're like okay I will cave on that
what I would never in a million years
give them a single vote not a single one
until we get daca chip and even the
other things that I laid out for you
protection for Social Security Medicare
net neutrality but the fact that they
went into the debate asking for one
thing they got nothing except a promise
that eventually we'll vote on it and
then now they don't know where and I'm
gonna do that well then what the [ __ ]
are the Democrats good for they're good
for nothing and there's this theory
floating around now and it looks pretty
good right now
that they're controlled opposition that
you have you know what happens is the
donors fund really strong Republicans
who don't back down under any
circumstances they fund really weak
Democrats and the whole point of the
Democrats is you know they're like the
wrestler you know how there's a wrestler
who's old and no longer star and they're
in the twilight of their career and then
the idea is a new wrestler comes up and
they
over on the old wrestler meaning that
they become popular by beating this old
you know wrestler who has somewhat of
some name recognition or whatever well
that's what the Democrats are you know
Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi the
leadership of the Democratic Party
they're funded by big donors they're
funded by Wall Street they're funded by
Big Pharma and for-profit health
insurance companies and their job is to
go out there say yeah we kind of with
the people I guess we're not as shitty
as the other guys but then whenever an
actual policy fight happens immediately
the Democrats came here have whatever
you want Republicans and that they had
the nerve are you kidding me Chuck
Schumer had the nerve to say well you
know if the people gave us the if people
voted for us then you know maybe we'd
have the DREAM Act now you wouldn't
fight for it when you had over eighty
percent of the American people with you
you wouldn't take a stand on it so we're
supposed to believe you that don't worry
I'm really for it and and why the [ __ ]
would we believe you on that you caved
immediately and you got nothing yeah it
looks like they could be controlled
opposite they're weak on purpose they're
weak on purpose all of all the
grassroots energy and everything which
is gone it's nowhere to be found because
this now people are getting the wake-up
call that we were rewarding them that
this was the case from day one but
they're getting the wake-up call like oh
this Democratic Party is utterly useless
they're just totally useless they don't
believe in actual populist Left ideas
they don't want to fight for the people
so you know [ __ ] why the [ __ ] would we
help them exactly which is why primaries
are the answer there's a lot of
primaries going on right this second
Justice Democrats are running over 50
different candidates the candidates are
all populist left and they're fighting
for Medicare for all in free College in
a living wage and they wouldn't have
buckled on so this is such a no-brainer
no we're not gonna give you a [ __ ]
the DREAM Act the DREAM Act
you're gonna we're not gonna get you're
not gonna get a single vote if it's not
for the if you don't have the DREAM Act
in there okay that's such a no-brainer
but
there are candidates out there who will
do the right thing but of course the
Democratic Party they're suppressing
those candidates and they're propping up
the candidates who are weak who are
corporate and who are Republican light
and we're gonna get to another story on
that later where you're gonna I'm gonna
give you the details of that because
really when you peek behind the curtain
holy [ __ ] it's worse than any of us ever
thought but there you have it the
Democratic Party they couldn't they
couldn't get any more week the
Republicans will when the Republicans
have a policy that is 30% liked for
example the tax bill they just passed
about 30% the American people like to I
think was 33% they take a policy where
they're at 30% and they'll run roughshod
over everybody and they'll say you're
crazy if you disagree with me we're
gonna do this policy the Democrats have
over 80% I will cave immediately and
give you everything you want they didn't
even start the negotiation by asking for
things that are overwhelmingly popular
that the American people want they'd
even start the negotiation from there
they started by asking for one thing and
then eventually they came and didn't get
that got a promise to do it later and
then now we know they're I mean get that
[Music]
they don't get it they'll never get it -
then the answer is always the same oh we
always should move right in order to be
more moderate be more bipartisan
compromise more and that's the way we
get people to like us more the more we
stab our base in the back the more we
pick up those moderate voters in the
suburbs who are fiscally conservative
but socially moderate so hey that's the
direction we're gonna go and you've been
trying that for decades and every time
you've gotten your ass handed you on a
silver platter
you lost a thousand seats under Barack
Obama Hillary Clinton lost running on
that exact same model to Donald Trump a
dumbass reality star with an IQ of
sixteen but still your answers wild now
the problem wasn't that we moved to the
right the problem is we didn't move
right enough now here let's cave
completely on the dreamers and then
maybe somehow that'll help us at the
polls know it's going to hurt you
massively and now you're making it so
there's gonna be mixed results in 2018
there's all this grassroots energy and
people despise Donald Trump in the
Republicans and then you'll come along
and somehow make it so that you're more
spies than them even some mainstream
media corporate democrat apologists were
like holy [ __ ] that's the weakest thing
I've ever seen in my life you caved
immediately that's disgusting
even people who are already inclined to
agree with the likes of Nancy Pelosi and
Chuck Schumer even they're like whoa you
guys are really really bad at this
aren't you
we are back [ __ ] gonna get
tired I know there's gonna be a
conspiracy that pops up that's like he's
just trying to upload two videos so he
can get more money from the two videos
the last [ __ ] was bad like it was good
for a while I have a picture of the
frozen screen so I could tweet that [ __ ]
out I haven't been on Twitter in a while
but um it was like and I was like
[ __ ] put your finger down at me
and it didn't stop right it was just
like oh and then it had like the
rotating spinning wheel [ __ ] but I heard
you good yeah it was like it got it got
bad like Barrow is making out words it
could be a Wi-Fi issue we could be a
Skype issue it could be some other [ __ ]
but whatever it is what it is
right now I still have the thing now
when I hear you and then I see your
mouth move but it doesn't matter it's
all really yeah what's the latest some
porn search that's probably what's
hacking this [ __ ] milf squirt [ __ ]
deep crowded public masturbation saline
[ __ ]
Jesus Christ that's some that's some
weird [ __ ] that's some weird porn sites
huge butt plug somebody types in
worldstar somebody typed in sex with
sister homeless man imagine just someone
put like like Nikes or groceries like
some normal [ __ ] they thought they were
they thought they were like typing into
Google something I was just somebody
typed Scarlett Johansson like
Valentine's Day gifts or something good
anyway
so we still got poles beach poles yeah
dude okay so so we get the one live with
Britney Spears Christina and Jessica
Simpson yes that is live okay
and then we did sprite verse seven up
versio did we put that one up yet or no
I thought that one that was as I was
starting to not hear you but I thought
okay like sprite would win on a
landslide on that [ __ ] oh we didn't put
that up yet okay so let's put that one
on now sprite verse seven up verse
Sierra Mist
I think sprites gonna wax that ass
I also think sprite is gonna win but
it's gonna be closed with 7up I think I
think it's gonna be closed with 7up 7up
is come on strong but sprite I don't
know sprite is like more relatable to
hood kids and stuff like that like they
get him well with rap music and [ __ ] and
what 7up is 7up some preppy [ __ ] 7up is
like sprite 7 can I compare that [ __ ] to
7up is like you're at like your your
uncle's barbecue and there's seven up
there yeah seven up is like I don't even
know like I like 7up better I think
it'll be closed between sprite and 7up
yes the Aramis they ain't [ __ ] moving
nothing on that shoe yeah you in that
category what what category is mountain
doing didn't we do in the pole for best
soda oh no we didn't did we miss that
and I meant to bring that up too because
I know we didn't put it in there but we
should have I read comments afterwards
and some people in the comment section
were like how did you guys not even
think of Mountain Dew and I was like
you're so right like that should have
been in there really Mountain Dew yeah
you don't like Mountain Dew I don't
think I've given it enough chances Oh
I'm stunned right now because man I love
Mountain Dew number one and number two
if you were to ask me like does Corinne
like Mountain Dew my response would be
without even asking you I'd be like he
loves Mountain Dew didn't he asked me
that I'd be like he loves Mountain Dew I
used to like they came out with the Code
Red by the way while you were away I
grabbed one of these oh you're smart man
I texted you on Sunday I thought I was
trying to have as many as I could
how many did you get - that's half that
at five I told you man we're we're old
now we can't do that [ __ ] when we were
on college we could put more than that
away but I think I have like I don't
have 15 or 16 in my fridge or something
like that and then at 5:00 I was just
like I just feel full and like hey did
you feel fine or no yeah I felt fine cuz
I took a shower at night and sort of
just washed all the [ __ ] off me mm-hmm
and sort of felt
good start a drink in middle of the day
right yeah early I started yet first
football game I like two o'clock okay so
that's why you felt fine yeah
I'm not I don't generally like alcohol
like I when I drink alcohol makes me
especially if I have it like early and
by the night I have a headache if I
drink it early and if I drink it a night
it's fine but I always feel sloppy when
I like now I since I don't drink anymore
if I have like I don't drink anymore you
just show me I'm saying you know I don't
drink like this is the first time I've
had a beer and [ __ ] weeks yeah but
like if I have three beers I will be
legitimately like tipsy slash drunk and
I'll feel and I'll feel sloppy like
that's why I'm not a big fan of clocks I
feel like sloppy when I drink it yeah
every Bowl like intoxication it's like a
[ __ ] like yeah yeah intoxication and
you feel dehydrated bloated and [ __ ]
yeah so it's not my favorite but like
these are the let this was the last beer
in the fridge so what I think we should
have I think I think Coronas are [ __ ]
just like the best beer out there right
well this is next week's ball if you
have morning shower verse night and then
we'll do beers in next week but I still
have some I wanted to get through today
so maybe we should save these for next
week but wait one note on Mountain Dew
wasn't there a study I think the reason
I was turned off to Mountain Dew because
that [ __ ] will always like your sperm
count right thing but it's not just
Mountain Dew it's like a food it's like
a it's like a flavouring or something
that's in a lot of [ __ ] it's in like
whatever like [ __ ] a lot of different
sodas and it's in a lot of different
foods oh really
yeah it's it's some food coloring or
something like that and that's what
turned me off to it like I always wanted
to give it a chance and I think I did
like it but then I heard that like study
came out a rumor or whatever and I was
like nah [ __ ] that I can't no I'm not I
don't know how significant that is
though because it's it's like the same
thing like with accutane there when
everybody was like oh [ __ ] that [ __ ]
causes like depression and and suicide
so they click a warning on the on the
bottle for it but basically excuse me
the way the story goes is like there was
literally one case of somebody who
happened to be on accutane who commit
suicide and then they like it was like
anecdotal and they were like well we
need to put the warning because this
person was on [ __ ] accutane and the
committed suicide but it's like you
don't know that that was the [ __ ] that
caused the game do it like that's
ridiculous there might actually be like
a lower incidence of people who take a
guillotine to commit suicide than the
general population committing suicide
like it's just they drew the connection
where they're necessarily one so I took
accutane I never had a single problem
with it my friend
so yeah Kay never had a single problem
with it uh-huh so it's one of those
things I don't know how yeah it could
have just been a myth that started like
there could have been a video of a guy
like a porn or something banging his
girl and then like took a sip of
Mountain Dew lost his hard-on because he
was like a porn star or some [ __ ] and
then a rumor just got started with that
like rumor spread fast yeah that was the
Mountain Dew that he couldn't get hard
cuz the Macan do these t like has the
whole video just trying to explain that
[ __ ] so the other poles I wanted to do
which I think we'll save for next week
but we could discuss them now the pole
of which is the best tic-tac in fact I
have tic-tacs there it's actually across
the room now but oh they're so white are
orange hands I was gonna say that's my
favorite they're light orange and green
are the tekneqs
orange definitely number one but white
is putting up a strong fight because
that's like the grown man tic-tac now so
I think it's funny you say that because
I think I think white handily beats
green like yes white beats green handily
but in my mind get worked up by orange
if they were industry orange tic tac is
the Tiger Woods of the tic-tac world
yeah like like that's that 14 major
championships for orange and the closest
is like Phil Mickelson with like six
just way back there like Phil Mickelson
is is the is the yet the white but it's
not touching the [ __ ] orange yeah no
no no yeah White's not touching orange
but I think I think there is a
progression of that [ __ ] I think Orange
we liked it because it was when we were
younger but now I've sort of advanced to
the white not me man
I still orange team yeah cuz I just I
came up with the idea for this poll then
I was like I'm gonna get a thing of Tic
Tacs for each one
so the past few weeks I had like one of
each year and I started with orange I
was like these are [ __ ] good yeah and
then I was like okay now I'm gonna get
the green I was expecting the green to
be bangin I was like these look like
you're gonna be good and then I said
it's not even like a green green color
right isn't it like a light it's like a
lightest turquoise e-type kind of green
but it's masculine as green should [ __ ]
we're poisoning the well here we have to
do this pull now because then people
listen to us and be like oh we're going
Orange - I got another [ __ ] pole just
sprung off of that pole [ __ ] we got so
many poles Kylie and corns poles is the
new name of the show oh great a
starburst of all time hell yeah that
[ __ ] is where's the question I don't
know other people would say no I think I
spoke to someone they said they didn't
like the pink [ __ ] I was like no like
the pink [ __ ] that's like not [ __ ]
utter obviously came out with a
starburst flavor like starburst
and like the thing was all pinks so if
you have that genius like a the [ __ ]
that everybody likes you know that's got
to be the best [ __ ] okay that is genius
and I'm gonna go buy them yeah they have
that all Pink's the whole shoot is pink
okay so I'm doing the tic-tac one now
because we have to do it is your
prediction that ours is gonna blow them
out of the water in the pole though or
no it might be stupid it might be like
84% orange in a three purse oh you think
so yeah I do
orange orange like people in Japan know
about orange people in like third world
countries know about orange tic tacs I
feel like I feel like the others might
actually surprise us because you and I I
don't know we bias because we like the
sweetness of the orange one the bet
better by far but other people when they
look for a tic-tac they might not be
looking for the sweetness they might be
looking for the mint enos you know what
I mean yeah if if you like if you ask
anybody tic-tac they say the orange [ __ ]
like whether or not they like it or not
orange is just the goat of Tic Tacs okay
maybe you're right maybe I'm curious to
see the results now I'm happy we did
this poll now and we didn't wait till
next week that's like Girl Scout cookies
like there's better flow
but when you think of Girl Scout cookies
you think Thin Mints like there are
better flavors but Thin Mints is just
like would win a poll hands-down just
because that's the that's the Air Jordan
like that's that's the [ __ ] test to
[ __ ] but that's not I feel like white
tic tacs or more the go to tic-tac for
people then the then the orange even the
orange are way better just in the same
way for Girl Scout cookies I hear your
point I think you're right
but the Samoa is in my mind are way
better that's what I'm saying but but I
don't think people going into a poll I
think they would just give it to
thinman's just because it was like you
got to bow down to that [ __ ] now you go
to CVS the most stuff of the most Tic
Tacs that are gonna be missing are the
orange shits that's a good point
there's that's a good effect like I'm
not really gonna see the white and the
green and then the on it it could just
be like a lot less yes if you're like
hey which which one sells out the most
the dude behind the counter will be like
probably orange all right [ __ ] so I
wrote down starburst pole Girl Scout
cookie pole morning shower overnight
shower beer pole I got and I haven't
even gotten to the other the last one I
wanted to do today which was pancakes
versus waffles vers french toast that's
a good ass pole cuz I was just thinking
about that [ __ ] the other day I would
never order waffles if I went to a
restaurant or some [ __ ] never I don't
think so I think really I think and
pancakes is some [ __ ] that you would get
as a side like because usually your
omelette comes with two pancakes with a
bowl that statement
I always feel how pancakes or some Maine
[ __ ] I feel like oh really
that's me in my mind that's what it is
but then again the I've had pancakes
more in my life when like my mom has
made me pancakes
versus I know you're talking are you
gonna like IHOP or some [ __ ] yeah but
our pancakes like a main [ __ ] even at
IHOP or no I don't think so I think it's
on side [ __ ] at IHOP what
because pancakes I don't know how you
feel about pancakes in terms of how like
full they get you but I get so full from
pancakes like I yeah I guess I'm like so
[ __ ] full yeah yeah I agree they're
haters here's a here's another thing
- [ __ ] on French toast even though it
could be at the top of the list in some
people's opinion if you have a bangin
french toast
there's an International House of
Pancakes there's a Waffle House but
there's no French toast like restaurant
change [ __ ]
so if they can't even get into the
[ __ ] restaurant chain business how
they trying to be number one on the list
not buying it because I feel like yeah
because you would think you would think
there would be like a waffle like a
waffle zone or some [ __ ] because the
opposite the same point you're making
could be a reason in the opposite
direction which is it's more of like a
delicacy like oh [ __ ] we're having
french toast in this [ __ ]
oh so it's more exclusive than its own
it's like the VIP room like oh [ __ ]
that's a good argument I mean look in my
mind but you I was thinking of a
different point about French toast when
you mention that which is it's hit or
miss like you could get a french toast
that you're like I know people who make
bad french toast that's what I'm saying
like somebody can make a French toast
and you're like you see like a little
bit of egg on it and you're like why is
there why do I see the egg on it like
know sometimes the egg on that [ __ ] is
bangin though what that yeah that's the
thing is like so yeah but when it's not
right when it's all white looking and
[ __ ] [ __ ] up french toast and you're
like it's is this should be delicious
but it's not that delicious but like
pancakes I feel like even shitty
pancakes are pretty good like I've never
had pancakes and been like you yeah
you're right the first couple pancakes
that you make in the pan usually are the
ones that are [ __ ] up there's no
there's no I think they're the better
ones because there's more butter in that
[ __ ] oh no I disagree because they're
not because it doesn't get the pans
either not hot enough and unless I maybe
on my pan that isn't hot enough but
those are the ones that are usually the
most albino looking okay okay the first
couple ones cuz the pans not hot and
then you put the like the fourth one on
and the shit's brown all around back in
the glory days of life when my mom used
to make me pancakes
it was I would tell her like this is I
sound like [ __ ] Cartman like name do
this for me man
I mean I I would tell her like you gotta
add like after the first batch of
Pancakes like pause for a minute and
heavy butter into the pan cuz then when
she cooks the first one with the butter
it's delicious if she doesn't add more
butter then it's just like the later
ones become like dark and not as fluffy
and delicious
that is true obviously okay but in my
mind I do have to say though and when it
comes to waffles there's like I prefer
the Belgian waffles the fluffier waffles
I don't know how you feel about that
versus regular waffles like I eat I go
to the difference well like in eggo
waffle for Legos I like like that kind
of a waffles a little thinner oh you're
talking about the kind like that they
have at the hotels that you could flip
the [ __ ] over and it's 2 minutes and
this [ __ ] is like yeah yeah the thick
fluffy waffles
yes the Belgian waffles I like those the
best but I also like Eggos I in fact I
eat that goes more yeah but I like the
Belgian ones but in my mind look overall
I'm gonna have to give it to I'm gonna
have to give it to french toast in my
mind because really yes and here's why
cuz when you get good french toast
it's just soars above waffles and
pancakes like that's a good-ass point
because the french toast
it's like french toast to draw another
golf analogy is like John Daly like John
Daly's a crazy [ __ ] you know
he's fat he's out of shape but he's a
regular ass dude with regular ass
problems but like when he played well in
his prime he won two majors like like
that's his peak that his peak is high
like he blowing away a field and [ __ ]
hitting the ball 350 yards like that's a
french toast french toast is like you
could have won that's gross but then
when somebody nails french toast you're
like yes that's a good point the ceiling
on french toast is way higher than like
pancakes you know what you're gonna get
even like the top chef in the world can
make pancakes that potentially me or you
can make yeah
waffles same type of [ __ ] you're using a
waffle maker mm-hmm french toast like
you got to have the right amount of egg
you could throw some you could show
throw some of that white [ __ ] on it that
is like powder didn't throw some [ __ ]
like whipped cream on that [ __ ] yeah I
could do that I think that's gonna be
the most evenly balanced poll that we
have
I think see I think pancakes are gonna
win i think pancakes are gonna win and
maybe by not by a lot but not
necessarily by a little like I think
pancakes are gonna crush yeah I think
pancakes will win but I'm with you I
think french toast because of that
reason the ceiling is way way high on
that [ __ ] and waffles is just like
anybody [ __ ] baby can make that [ __ ]
doll can make that [ __ ]
so so then you agree with me french
toast is your pick but you think wow
yeah you think waffles will edge it out
or kind of win a little comfortable no I
think pancakes
okay I'm insane cakes yeah holes
pancakes french toast is a good [ __ ]
but then there's a [ __ ] another poll
it's just straightforward I hop or
Waffle House I'll add that to the list I
don't I honestly don't think I've ever
eaten at a Waffle House before I've
eaten that IHOP but isn't Waffle House
more in the south
yeah it's just more and random like
hello hello hello everybody what's up
welcome to the shiz oh we make a whole
show and no [ __ ] issues weird issues
it'll happen at some point the
definitely yeah like the random like you
know weird connection or whatever yes
[ __ ] freezin or like you you hear me I
don't hear you yeah well that one was
rare but cross your fingers on that one
that was a random one like I'd never
happened before I know I feel like it's
doing that [ __ ] right now like you're
sort of like going slow but I think I
think it's gonna pull through for me my
computer well my internet is on point
so that's your [ __ ] I should become a
Mac from like 88 like the first [ __ ]
that came out it's an old Mac it's like
a 2000 something Mac it's like one of
those silver laptop ones but it's like
one of the first shits
yeah they had that silver thing for a
long time yeah the way that they yeah so
we got a lot of um we should just change
the name of the show to Kyle and Correns
poles because not only does that sound
gay as [ __ ] it also is like what we just
do on this show now yeah that's it would
make its way on to you porn if we just
named this like there's the there's the
lesbian how do they put it lesbian
soccer mom fart compilation is on there
cuz of Leon and it's me making my fart
noises on air he put that up there and
it's just I came across that I'll be I
think I wouldn't be tight I'll be I
would be excited no it's amazing because
there's thousands of views on it and the
light rate is like over 90% that's
hilarious yeah so I mean I guess that's
just because people who listen to the
show
like I retweeted it I think once so
people who listen to the show watched it
and they were like that's funny and they
liked it but could you imagine you're
you got some like weird fetish of
hearing like lesbians fart on each other
and like you're looking it up and like
you see actual videos like that and then
there's just me yeah anyone who went to
that [ __ ] like without knowing you yeah
definitely has a problem yeah they'd be
pissed there's that guy brandon waddell
who's a comedian who uploaded like they
uploaded a part of his
Podcast to you porn or something or horn
hub and it said like I don't know
something about like young boy [ __ ]
blows whatever some some dude it was
like a joke they uploaded it like that
and Matt dislikes so like it somehow
made it I don't know if it made it to
the main page of pornhub or whatever oh
man like people were clicking on the
video expecting to see him like blow
somebody and when he didn't people were
mad I mean lookit understandable if
you're on a porn site and you're trying
to jerk off like you're gonna want to
see what you came to see yeah
oh that makes me feel so dirty for even
being on that site that people go on
that site like looking for weird [ __ ]
like that oh yeah there's a [ __ ] I wish
I remembered the name of it there's this
thing that live tracks what people are
searching on porn on a porn site and it
was [ __ ] devastating like it's not
like you would think that a large chunk
of them are just searching for like
whatever [ __ ] big tits you know but
good [ __ ] like just random like
Street the normal like the normal
shopping aisle is it is [ __ ] crazy in
fact I'm gonna look it up now while
we're talking because I could if we if I
read that out on air people will laugh
their [ __ ] ass off and how ridiculous
it is yeah I feel like it's a live feed
of people sighs eat of what people
search website that tracks searches yeah
there's definitely some weird [ __ ] on
there but then there's just some normal
[ __ ] probably just like Apple like happy
couple happy married couple
nobody searches that [ __ ] nobody website
that tracks porn searches life like
someone searching like guy who actually
ordered pizza that he wants to eat have
you seen those there's those porn videos
where dudes put their dick in the in
through the box the I've never seen it
but that's like the stereotype just like
typical like big sausage pizza type of
legs yeah that's literally the name of
the thing I think a here it is I think
yeah porn MD use live search
stream to see what porn users crave
let's imagine someone really wanted to
see that like they were really craving
like one of those big sausage pizza
videos okay wait before you actually put
my bed I have to cut you off because I'm
on the site now oh you got it gay Roman
holds Teddy what a mature FFM pale
freckles big [ __ ] pissing Jesus Christ
no no mom foot job son someone search
that this is what people are searching
right now oh my god some of them are
normal like POV point of view teen
[ __ ] small [ __ ] humiliation iron man
iron dick that's just a guy lined up on
a wall and people are just like pointing
at his small [ __ ] humiliating him I
think that's gotta be right small [ __ ]
humiliations gotta be something like
that there's nothing sexual in it
besides a guy with his pants down and B
were just laughing it's they probably
like I don't know at some point
somebody's nothing I guess right it's
the ball busting dice ball busting dice
female bicep worship like somebody jerks
off to that
yeah probably guys from the gym probably
get into that one all right my bad what
were you saying before and for the rest
of the show every like eight minutes I
will say one thing somebody sir [ __ ] but
what was what were you saying when I cut
you off
oh no I was saying like someone who
actually really wanted to see a big
sausage like Pizza video and the video
is actually just someone like getting of
pigs like sauce it's this big order of
pizza and they just eat that [ __ ] the
whole video well there are people who do
like like to get off to women just
eating that like that that's it like
they stuffed themselves like it's women
who are moreover overweight and then
they give them food and they just keep
eating the [ __ ] food there's like a
name for it guys want to watch women
just [ __ ] well I was sort of
fascinated by like I said last week that
show
my leg which won't stop growing or
whatever oh yeah yeah like I wasn't I
wasn't like attracted to it but I was
sort of just fascinating to watch that
[ __ ] you know so it's like almost like
if you see a large human being just in
their element eating some [ __ ] you're
like damn that's what they're doing what
they want to be doing right now
oh damn so you had that feeling of like
of like I'm kind of jealous that they
just said [ __ ] you to all the rules
well that but oh yeah I was just
fascinated at the how big their legs
were like it's something that I don't
see every day you know so it's like I
guess people have a fascination towards
[ __ ] that I mean I don't know people
have foot fetishes and they see feet
every day but you don't see like that
feet yeah those are yeah those are like
two slightly different things where you
have people who want to see
extraordinary people whether it be for
the good or the bad like yeah like so
that's a thing but then also just people
get off to weird [ __ ] true so that's why
you again it's book of world records
like even the freak people like that
they used to get mad attention because
like people would just never would see a
lizard guy or like worse sometimes I get
this bottle sometimes it gets like a
little cruel like you remember the old
the old school circuses used to be like
get like you know whatever like a really
hairy woman and be like you're a [ __ ]
freak [ __ ] now get out there and have
people laugh at you like yeah yeah and
like with midgets and [ __ ] they do that
in um in Dominican Republic and when I
went to Colombia like their big thing is
like at these they have like these shows
it's it's like a dance club but then
they have like a show and like they
perform and all this stuff and their big
thing is like midgets and like people
and the ER and Columbia are like
fascinated by them and it's like they
degrade them so much on stage like just
making fun of them and just using them
as like props or whatever and like the
person is probably making decent money
because they're working at like a
popular place yeah but just to get [ __ ]
it on and yeah yeah that's a thing you
know that's that's definitely a thing I
mean we have versions of that like when
you really think about it even a show
like cops like I'm like I actually kind
of enjoyed watching it half the time
but like
half of the [ __ ] they do on cops is like
[ __ ] tackle nonviolent like weed
smokers like somebody yeah smoking some
weed on the corner and then this poor
person got their life [ __ ] ruined by
an [ __ ] cop who like chases him down
and [ __ ] and we're sitting there
watching it for entertainment like this
isn't [ __ ] the guy's life is ruined
for you no it's so true some nothing
[ __ ] but everybody watches it like let's
watch this [ __ ] yeah
it's so [ __ ] up there's some about
when you put a [ __ ] uniform and a
badge on somebody it's just everybody
it's almost like a trick like a trick to
make everybody feel like what they're
doing has to be official because they're
wearing a badge I mean mm-hmm it's like
we're even like a doctor's coat or
something like that or that anywhere
like whenever I'm out and and I'm
wherever somewhere in public and I'm
wearing a suit and tie
you can even sense it in other people
that they look at you like oh [ __ ] he
might be really important nope
just because you're wearing a suit and
tie yeah any person could go to the
[ __ ] store and buy a suit and tie
it's not okay you know it's just one of
those things yeah it's [ __ ] weird
that's so it's always such a yeah it's
such a weird concept people who do look
at you differently like what like what
is this guy doing why isn't wearing a
suit totally yeah but on the on the porn
tracker cute little [ __ ] was one that
came up while we were talking yeah I
feel like that would be a common one Oh
somebody typed in TR ymp shrimp but were
they trying to type in Trump oh maybe
Trump or shrimp submissive [ __ ] pig
slapped that one sounds good some of
them were words I can't even pronounce
like it looks like our German word Jason
moon buttons her pink blouse oh yeah
they probably do international [ __ ] and
people in Germany probably want to see
some [ __ ] insertions dog like this is
the [ __ ] people search man I don't even
know what that I don't even know that
that just sounds weird now here's a
normal one titty [ __ ] [ __ ] MILF that dude
is definitely looking for an old video
that he saw like six months ago
he's like damn
that's all I know it was like a MILF in
it and he he nodded like on earth that's
like you ever looked for music lyrics on
Google yeah and you just type it
whatever you think of like most random
part of the song where you're not even
sure what they're saying but you're
gonna guess like I think they say this
in it and then you type it in and it
does like three other songs that are not
the song and you're like [ __ ] yeah or
you try to just you try to do the beat
yeah any words you can now be heard it's
like da da da da da da da da
there was one time where it was like the
beat was in my head but I didn't
remember any of the words and I was like
there's literally no way I'm gonna get
this song now there's no way I'm gonna
get it like if you were there or
somebody was there where I could have
done the beat maybe you would have been
able help me but I was sitting there by
myself and I just had my computer I
can't do with the beat did you get the
shooter no I didn't get the [ __ ] and
then there was that one time I told you
this we even spoken about on the podcast
before there was this hot rap song I
heard when I was driving and there was a
one line and it I remember the guy was
like I like girls that like girls like
Ellen yeah it was like a freestyle rap
I remember you tell him the beat was hot
and then dude said that and then I was
like oh I will easily find this song
later so I'm just gonna type in that
lyric and it couldn't find it and then I
was like I was mad because I thought
this is definitely like just almost like
a freestyle on some mixtape you know and
they were just playing it like at the
lunch hour or some [ __ ]
mmm and they never really play it a lot
and then I was like really mad that I
couldn't find that song they never found
that song either never found that song
and I tried so hard I asked everybody
obviously remember our friend Jimmy he'd
wrap inside and out I was like you have
to know this song you're searching for
that song forever like when you were
telling that [ __ ] to people they're
probably like sometime what like what I
know I don't know what Jimmy was like I
think I know it's like I know the song
you're talking about like oh really Pete
that line I was like yes that's the line
but I don't know what comes before I
don't know what comes after it I don't
even remember how the beat goes but
that's this [ __ ] I know is in the song
he was like I don't know he's I don't
know I can't tell you I was like no yeah
I feel like that would be so hard but
I'd feel like if you had some of the
lyrics you should have been able to find
that you know
I know I know but it's one of those
things where you needed like one more
line and then you could've gotten yeah I
sometimes can't think of any of the
lyrics and then I'll think of one word
for the [ __ ] and then like the whole
song will come back to me and then I'm
like I got that [ __ ] and then I'll find
it on Google and then sometimes this
song will like you'll forget it but then
one time the song will randomly pop in
your head and you're like oh that's the
[ __ ] yeah yeah have you ever been like
sitting there thinking about it and like
waiting for it to hit you and you're
like I know it's gonna hit me but why
has it not hit me yet you got to wait
like 20 seconds and then it might hit
you yeah I mean before where it's like
good in my memory and it's examen out
yet I got a start yeah I got it like
like dig for one word in the song and
then like I'll find the [ __ ] mm-hmm
speaking of that freezing [ __ ] my ship
froze and it was when you were pointing
and it looks like you were like pointing
screaming at me oh [ __ ]
unfortunately that's not the one that
people are gonna see they're gonna see
my end where it's just tonal okay good I
want to take a picture this is shows
manatee oh now yours is slowly freezing
holy [ __ ] Oh cuz I maybe I just put my
phone to take the picture its depth on
the phone probably I got on the side of
my screen the raw [ __ ] from last night
oh I wanted to talk about that we'll
talk about that in a second I wanted to
first we got to do our polls we got to
get them out of the way oh yeah so
there's a few we're gonna do there was
one that you and I spoke about last week
I forget what it was where we said all
we'll do that next week you mom I was
talking to Molly about this it was
Christina Aguilera Britney Spears okay
and then I was like should we well she
was like if you do that Bowl don't throw
a Madonna in that [ __ ] cuz she's not
she's not in that category yeah I kind
of agree with that but then I was like
Lady Gaga might be in that [ __ ] and she
was like more of a gaga than Madonna but
no not even Gaga right not even Gaga but
then I threw another [ __ ] into
that [ __ ] Jessica Simpson yes that
actually makes sense
who should be on that [ __ ] I think I
agree we'll add her but she's gonna get
rocked but I think she belongs on that
poll yes he'll definitely get work but
maybe she gets in love I mean she's more
popular um is your phone still by the
thing or no Chuck you're from those far
away bouquet all right keep it far away
I did this I gotta do the same with mine
cuz it did start kind of lagging a
little bit think it's mice yeah my skype
i think is probably [ __ ] up
you're still pointing at me i feel like
i'm getting reprimanded right now oh my
god it's still frozen on that same
screen that's crazy the same [ __ ]
okay so we got Britney Spears Christina
Aguilera I may have spelled Aguilera
wrong who knows how to spell that [ __ ]
and Jessica Simpson
I feel like Brittany's gonna do work in
that one because Christina's like fat
and sort of irrelevant now yeah I think
Brittany's gonna win although it's gonna
be hilarious to see the results of this
just cuz my my audience is
overwhelmingly male it's about 88% male
and so I think my Twitter followers it's
the same thing so most of the responses
there's gonna be the [ __ ] is wrong with
you like why are you asking this yeah
but they're not it's a legit quite now
they probably [ __ ] with either one of
them by the way gay grandfather somebody
is searching for porn wise right now
damn I feel bad for that dude there
something happened and that guy's like
younger life does Tina Aguilera I fell I
did spell it right holy [ __ ] hey good
for us
okay so who's better Britney Spears
Christina Aguilera Jessica Simpson my
prediction is that Britney Spears is
gonna win Christina Aguilera second
followed by Jessica Simpson and if you
ask me who is better I think Christina
Aguilera has a better voice but I think
Britney Spears I think thought songs
yeah Britney Spears is like she sure her
trek-like
list would just [ __ ] on Christina
Aguilera's yeah even though Christina
Aguilera could sing better but Brit yeah
if you're asking someone to sing like a
national anthem at like Super Bowl or
some big ass event you're asking
Christina Aguilera Britney Spears yeah I
big question who's better I'm sorry for
this is that just saying she's better
okay so that's numero uno
so was there another one that we said we
were gonna do or no because I have three
others that I want to talk about I don't
remember any other ones I always
thinking of one when I was Duke I do
this [ __ ] all the time
brush my teeth in the shower but I
didn't know if that [ __ ] was weird or
not when I was younger I did it okay we
have to do that poll that's a good one
when I was younger I did it and then at
some age I just stopped I was like no I
don't do that anymore but I just feel
like it's way more convenient because
when you do it outside of the shower you
get like the toothpaste all over your
mouth and stuff like that and then you
got a like rear into your mouth after
you showered well that's the thing is
like when I stopped it's like why don't
I do it anymore I should do it still I
see yeah I stopped at one point but
there's no reason like I just thought
like Oh older people don't do that but
that's not necessarily true yeah I think
like okay I think it's gone and they
were and they were we I don't know if
they were weirded out by it but just
like like didn't know what to think
about it and I was like yeah that that's
the normal [ __ ] like you're cleaning
yourself in the shower you might as well
do your teeth if you're doing your hair
and like balls and ass and all that
stuff they didn't know what to think
about like they'd never heard anybody do
that before I think they heard of
Twitter seriously jumped the shark with
their most recent endeavor let me show
you a tweet here that certainly blew my
mind so a Twitter user here says shout
out to the hashtag resistance hashtag
resistance Twitter for having Twitter
emailing me suspecting that I spread
Russian propaganda hope you
ignominiously car theists are proud of
yourselves and then you can see the the
letter here as part of our recent work
to understand Russian linked activities
on Twitter during the 2016 US
presidential election we identified and
suspended a number of accounts that were
potentially connected to a propaganda
effort by Russian government linked
organization known as the internet
research agency consistent with our
commitment to transparency we are
emailing you because we have reason to
believe that you either followed one of
these accounts or retweeted or liked
content from these account during the
election period this is purely for your
own information purposes and is not
related to a security concern for your
account so there over 600,000 of these
emails went out now I have yet to
receive one yet but I should be
receiving one any day now because there
you have to understand how broad of a
scope this is the argument was made that
no they're trying to sow discontent or
discord or however they phrased it in
the US that's what that's what the
Russians TM are trying to do so they
went as far as to argue that for example
Oh activists who are pointing out
Hillary's poor record on African
American rights they're their Russian
plants so remember for example when the
activists was showed up to a Hillary
donor event and she kept hitting her
with the super-predators quote like you
called us
for predators and Hillary's like yeah
anyway whatever [ __ ] move along you
know and the list goes on and on
oh you voted for the crime bill the
things that Hillary Clinton you take you
take money from Saudi Arabia and then
you pretend to be super feminist like
what at what you've done Haiti and
Honduras so when people pointed that out
there's no counter-argument to that it's
just true like that [ __ ] is just true
about Hillary and how bad her record is
on this stuff the crime bill you name it
so there's no response so what's the
counter-argument when you can't win oh
you're you're a tool you're a puppet of
the Russian government they're trying to
sow division in the United States and so
when you retweet an account like that
that is attacking Hillary on her record
when it comes to race you're a Russian
puppet so now we're gonna have to send
you an email saying uh hey we have
reason to believe that you either
followed one of these accounts or
retweeted or liked content from it you
better watch out what are you doing what
are you doing you're I guess you're
falling for Russian propaganda and
that's the thing is they make no
distinction between Oh was any of this
so-called Russian propaganda factually
accurate or not no no you just from the
internet research agency some Russian
thing if you retweet her like an account
from there that's your I guess you're a
sucker I guess you're a chump no quite
the opposite it seems the case of me
you're the suckers you're the chumps by
trying to do censorship by another name
trying to curtail free speech trying to
curtail a free and open discussion of
ideas because something something the
source is evil and bad and wrong and
anything from that source is tainted so
what if Russians like you know whatever
turkey sandwiches I like turkey
sandwiches ah [ __ ] Putin puppet
Russian BOTS I mean the wording of this
is [ __ ] Orwellian beyond imagination
as part of our recent work to understand
Russian linked activities on Twitter
during the 2016 presidential election we
identified and suspended a number of
accounts potentially connected to a
propaganda effort by the Russian
government linked organizations
potentially is doing a lot of work there
isn't it because we've already seen
stories Twitter has suspended Council
they set Russian trolls but then some of
those people like I'm not a Russian
troll what are you [ __ ] talking about
because again it's more about what are
you saying what arguments are you making
so you know what's next Oh anybody who
who shared those accurate WikiLeaks
emails from the DNC accurate species of
Hillary Clinton where she talks about
how she wants totally free and open
trade borders which is like NAFTA and
TPP on steroids where Hillary says oh
you know there's a lot of bigotry
against the rich in this country that's
what I think she said things like that
and you learned it from WikiLeaks and
from other leaks and the next step is I
your hey man we say even though we've
presented no evidence that WikiLeaks
works with the Russian government
therefore by sharing that information on
Twitter you're a Russian puppet and we
just want to send you an email saying
you better watch out you better watch
what you share this is a stunning
crackdown by the way so when it comes to
crackdowns on free speech it's much
harder for the government to do we have
the First Amendment and case law
throughout US history has consistently
ruled on the side of hey even odious
disgusting speech is protected speech so
and that's a good thing we have like an
absolutist interpretation of the First
Amendment as law right now but there's
another way that they can attack free
speech they can have their you know
their corporations that they're linked
at the hip with do the dirty work for
them so today we're not people aren't
likely to go out into a literal public
square and have discussions where do we
have our discussions well we have our
discussions on social media social media
is the new public square whether it's
Facebook or Twitter or what-have-you
so when you take this public platform
which is now the public square it's a
private platform since private
company but you have that private
company do the bidding of the public the
government not the public as in the
people but the public sector is in the
government when you have the private
corporations under pressure from elites
in the government start cracking down on
speech because I don't know something
something Russia well what you have here
is the perfect manifestation of a Red
Scare that's what this is and they're
gonna they're gonna use this to
crackdown against all dissenting voices
and again you might say well Kyle that's
you know you're extrapolating too much
here you're reading too much into it
but I would say to you it's already
happening they're already suspending
accounts they say a Russian propaganda
they're sending the threatening email
say you better watch out look at who
you're following and stuff like for
example I follow RT and RT America that
alone can be ground up here's a I can't
believe you're [ __ ] Russian propaganda
Russian propaganda now I take from RT
and RT America I take stories on Russia
with a grain of salt I do and I think
that's the right thing to do that's a
right approach to take but stories that
are not related to that they do a great
job they [ __ ] Tom Hartman works for
them he's fantastic ed Schultz works for
them you know who got fired from MSNBC
because he's against TPP you got a lot
of good people who weren't there so
again this is just a way to try to in a
broad way crackdown on dissent and it's
worse than that because so it's not just
Twitter chilling free speech in this way
and telling people hey don't say the
wrong things it's also Facebook doing it
and it's also Google doing it so you
guys have probably seen this already by
this point but they say Facebook founder
Mark Zuckerberg announces plan to
prioritize trustworthy news sources
based on user surveys so first of all
let's just put out there a hierarchy is
a terrible idea because you should have
a free and open exchange of information
you should have effectively net
neutrality for all the different
now that does mean that some shitty
outlets you know might get a little more
exposure than you'd like for example
Alex Jones but that's a small price to
pay for having real independent and
alternative outlets that tell the truth
out there not being discriminated
against but know what they're gonna do
is say oh now we're gonna have a
hierarchy of news outlets they say
they're doing it by user survey now what
are the effects of that well you're
gonna have the bulk of people go I guess
CNN I guess MSNBC and Fox so in other
words the people who are the established
media outlets who have huge name
recognition they're the ones who are
gonna get prioritized and that what
they're doing here is they're passing
the buck by saying oh well let the
people tell us which outlets but in
reality they knew from the very
beginning well what we really do is want
to prioritize established outlets now
that raises a very important question
what happens when those people spread
fake news because this is you know
Facebook is trying to get rid of fake
news by doing this well I don't know if
you know this but virtually all of
mainstream media referred to torture as
enhanced interrogation at the behest of
the Bush administration that's doing US
government propaganda and lying about
the nature of what's actually happening
mainstream media did that so will
mainstream media be deprioritized when
they push some [ __ ] like that
well mainstream media be deprioritized
when they ramped up the war in Iraq when
they did propaganda to get us into the
war in Iraq you know Phil Donahue was
fired because he was against the Iraq
war
so is are they going to say oh [ __ ]
mainstream media today is pushing fake
news so we got a deprioritize mainstream
media in the context of what's happening
right now they're not going to do that
what about when there were the WikiLeaks
email leaks and we saw everything that
Hillary and Debbie wasserman-schultz
said all those things were true but to
make sure media didn't cover them
because oh [ __ ] we might you know
something something Russia you know hey
maybe Russia helped in getting WikiLeaks
this information doesn't matter that is
true the source of how we got it
somewhat tainted and I don't know it
might help Donald Trump and we don't
like Trump so I don't don't [ __ ] run
with it well they will they be penalized
will they be deprioritized when they do
misleading stories trying to downplay
accurate leaks no they're not going to
do that so again this is censorship by
another name and I think what's scariest
to me because now it gets into not just
a broader issue a macro which now it's a
micro issue and it affects our bottom
line and it affects everything we're
doing here at secular talk but yes it
has been proven that we know that
Google's algorithm now prioritizes
mainstream outlets over all alternative
and independent media so yes we are
treated like Alex Jones and our results
are buried now in Google searches you
know you have alternate saw a drop of
over 50% as soon as Google tweaked their
algorithms because the argument is hey
look AlterNet they're the same as like
you know the [ __ ] Daily Caller what
Daily Caller is or worldnetdaily on the
far right AlterNet is that on the far
left so that's fake news so we got to
not do that you know hey that outlet may
have been harder on Hillary Clinton they
should have been so over 50% drop in
their traffic current affairs another
fantastic left-wing outlet over 70% drop
over 70% that doesn't happen naturally
that happens when they tweet the [ __ ]
algorithms so now Facebook's tweaked
it's a priority move away from news
completely by the way they want to
prioritize family and friends okay but
then to the extent that they prioritize
new stuff it's going to be major
establishment outlets that oftentimes
push total [ __ ]
so Facebook's doing that Google's doing
that and YouTube of course Google's the
parent company at YouTube so we've seen
the effects too you know Jimmy Dore took
a massive hit David Pakman took a
massive hit the amazing atheist who's
not even primarily political took a
massive hit because they're just saying
everybody that's not already established
we are going to deprioritize so that's
the effects of what we're talking about
now I want to show you this chart
because this is what's been happening
here at secular
talk behind the scenes I think this is
an important chart now I'm not saying
this is necessarily nefarious but I am
saying that there has been a trend and
this has been happening on a regular
basis so during the election we were
gaining a thousand new subscribers each
day now if you tell me Kyle looking and
off in a year that's not an election
year that's gonna drop maybe 40 percent
I'd say that's a big drop but you're
probably right maybe it'll you know
whatever I'll instead of gaining a
thousand new subscribers a day we'll
gain 600 new subscribers a day that's a
gigantic drop but I can see that because
you know with the election political
stuff is prioritized yada-yada if you
tell me no you will gain [ __ ] about a
hundred and 50 subs per day from a
thousand during the election down to 150
subs per day I'll tell you something's
wrong here something's wrong here they
are deep prioritizing our content and
they are D prioritizing our content I
just told you Google has done this
YouTube is owned by Google and with ad
pocalypse of course they did this they
put people in different categories of
how monetize they can be the level of
ads they get what happens when your
videos are D monetized and they are
harder to find when that happens they
don't share them as much on the sidebar
if you happen to watch secular talk all
the time you'll probably get some
secular talk videos on the sidebar but
it doesn't they don't attract new people
anymore so when it was a thousand subs a
day we're not talking about a 40% drop
which is massive
to gaining 600 subs a day we're talking
about 150 subs a day and then BOOM what
happens every now and then a purge an
absolute purge and you can see there
that there was a day that had dropped
off off the map and we lost more than a
hundred and fifty subscribers in a day I
want to explain some of you guys that
might not know that the trends of the
way this stuff works that's not a thing
that happens once your channel hits a
certain point you gain steadily that's
the way it works so if there's ever a
massive anomaly that is an anomaly that
happened on purpose now it could be
because hey YouTube is just purging
inactive accounts and honestly that
would have been my preferred answer I
would say that's yeah that seems like
the most reasonable answer but guess
what
I've gotten countless messages where
people like no I've had to subscribe
your channel three times because they
keep unsubscribe me from your channel
people who are subscribed go hey your
videos are not popping up on my main
page anymore I don't know why so I've
gotten countless you know messages like
that I know the same thing is happening
for Jimmy Dore David Pakman and others
so what you're seeing here yes from the
top down and many of this a lot of this
is being taken the the catalyst for it
all is Russia it's just been wiping out
taking a hatchet directly to all
independent and alternative media
outlets so you know I said this last
night man the so-called solution here is
worse than the problem no I'm not saying
Alex Jones isn't a problem the guy's a
[ __ ] maniac and he's a gigantic
audience and he has influence but the
solution is not let's [ __ ] censor him
or censor or you know deprioritize all
independent outlets but that is the
convenient answer for the establishment
because when YouTube became a giant
political force when independent media
became a giant force those guys Wolf
Blitzer is not gonna [ __ ] beat me in
the long run he's like watching a burnt
piece of toast or watching paint dry on
the wall he's as boring as boring can be
he's never said an interesting [ __ ]
thing in his life he's not gonna beat me
so since they can't beat us they cheat
and the cheating is you know the
tweaking of the Google algorithm the
YouTube algorithm tweaking of the
Facebook algorithm and we're talking
about life or death for so many
different independent media outlets so
if you like this show and you like the
content we put out and you appreciate it
I'd really uh I would love it it would
mean the world to me if you would
consider going to patreon.com/scishow
talk and donating even if it's just two
bucks a month you know I don't I would
rather have a little bit of money from a
lot of people to keep this going and
keep doing what
what we're doing um I don't want to you
know I want to do the opposite of the
[ __ ] model which is whoo let's go to
like one billionaire and get [ __ ] all
the money no billionaire would want to
fund us and I wouldn't want to take
money from a billionaire I don't want to
feel beholden to those people I want to
be beholden to the audience so if you
can give I think there's a an option of
$2 $3 and $7 you want to go nuts donate
seven dollars a month you want to go
middle-of-the-road just do three but at
least two dollars if you like what we do
and you respect it and you appreciate it
and you agree with most of the stuff
then please help us out and think of all
the different outlets that you like in
in this time of need because it's only
gonna get worse
it's gotten worse from from the
beginning of the rumblings of ad
pocalypse by the way there's never been
a recovery from ad pocalypse we have ads
now we run a blacklist then we're off
the blacklist but it still it was a 50%
cut for a long time now it's an over 60%
cut and I don't know if that's a link to
the new algorithm tweaks or whatever the
[ __ ] it is but that's why we need you
now more than ever think of all the
different creators who you appreciate
patreon.com slash secular talk I want to
thank you for doing that and for
everybody who's already a patron and who
has been helping all along I love you
and a sincere thank you from the bottom
of my heart
so last year we had the original women's
March 4 million people showed up I mean
that is such a large number I think I
think the articles of the time were
saying it was the biggest protest in US
history multiple different cities it
just all over the country people [ __ ]
poured out into the streets and it was
basically a sign of anti-trump ISM and
well yesterday in the day before we had
the second women's March that actually
carried over it was one day and then it
some of it carried over into the next
day but apparently in New York City it's
estimated that more than two hundred
thousand protesters marched this year
there were approximately 50,000
protesters in San Francisco five hundred
thousand in Los Angeles more than 40,000
in Oakland tens of thousands in Seattle
and more than 10,000 in Washington DC
they say that some cities like Chicago
and Philadelphia had larger protests
this year than last year and it's
estimated that the two cities combined
had more than 300,000 protesters now in
total about a little over 1 million
people showed up this year that's the
early estimates for this year's women's
March so you had 4 million last year
right in the wake of Donald Trump
getting elected you could argue that's
probably why we're even more people out
there now what year in 1 million people
showed up if that's a that's an
impressive showing you know you are
flexing some muscle if you get a million
people to show up anywhere for any
reason but I have to say you know in my
mind if anything it could have been the
reverse it should have been the reverse
so like ok if a little over 1 million
people show up for the first protest I
get it you know the guy didn't win the
popular vote Donald Trump he's a [ __ ]
maniac look at his countless statements
on the campaign trail that were just
genuinely scary and some of them
advocating for more crimes hey we're
gonna bring back torture and do it like
crazy we have to take out their families
killing civilians in the Middle East on
purpose so I get it I get it but there
was also an argument early on of hey
this guy's a monster we know he's a
monster but at least on economics he
said some populist things maybe he'll
pull through with it whether it's you
know stopping the trade deals that
outsource all the job
protecting Medicare Social Security or
any of that stuff he didn't come through
on that stuff but I could see it would
logically make sense to me that people
would say okay we hate him but just give
him a little bit of a chance first but
no you had the four million people
originally now a year later after all of
his monstrous policies there's fewer
people that doesn't make sense to me I
would say hey why don't you have even
more people this time around because
look at what the [ __ ] guy did the guy
just passed a tax bill that cuts
corporate taxes from thirty five percent
to twenty one percent that's a giant
giveaway to the rich and corporations I
mean we're already at a point in history
where corporations are paying a
historically low percentage of the tax
burden so it gives even more to
corporations shifting the burden on the
middle class and I mean that's like a
shock to the system holy [ __ ] look at
what this guys doing this is a this is a
class war waged by the rich and by
corporations on working people on
middle-class people and poor people
that's what's going on over a decade the
tax bill raises taxes on everybody
making $75,000 a year or less the guy
over three million people lost health
insurance his first year in office why
his countless executive orders that are
just taking a hatchet to the kneecap of
Obamacare gutting the the marketing
budget ninety percent so that they don't
get the word out of hey it's time to
enroll I mean the things that these guys
did they got rid of the individual
mandate in Obamacare which was the glue
that held the [ __ ] thing together in
the first place premiums are up twenty
percent and the list goes on and on he
appointed his cabinet is just packed
full of goldman sachs executives that's
why they did a tax bill that was in
favor of goldman sachs in favor of
corporations and Wall Street in the rich
because those guys wrote the [ __ ] tax
bill the estate tax cut that nobody was
asking for except the top point oh one
percent that's in the bill so the list
goes on and on I mean now we're bombing
eight different countries Obama was
bombing seven we added another one Niger
for good measure
you know we should have been bombing
seven now we're bombing eight and
Trump's first military rate as president
killed an eight-year-old American girl I
don't know why we're still not talking
about that that's a real
[ __ ] scandal right there instead of
the [ __ ] country's remark dad says
he killed a [ __ ] eight-year-old girl
who's in American his first rate as
president what the [ __ ]
increased drone strikes 432 percent so
with everything that the guys actually
done whoa uh how do you how was there a
decrease how is there a decrease how's
their [ __ ] decrease in people that
went out there and then look man here's
where my contrarian side kicks in and
I'm not doing this to be a dick I'm
doing this because I genuinely care
about these issues and I want to fix
them but look if you're doing a March
and the banner is women's March you're
blowing off steam that's what you're
doing you're blowing off steam
Oh women's March yay we're good people
it's got a very Hillary esque feel to it
a very mix em inist feel to it a very
you know we're for good things and
against bad things here's some
platitudes here's some cliches look at
the pink [ __ ] hats we're wearing and
there were I saw a lot of tweets where
people said listen I went last year the
women's March I ain't going this year
and the reason why I'm not going this
year is I don't think that these are
people who are really against
imperialism I don't think these are
people who are really trying to fight
back against corporatism and people are
saying look I'm like I feel like let
down by this thing that I became a part
of because and here's the main point it
is a largely leaderless now some people
will say oh that's a benefit but I
disagree I think you need somebody steer
in the ship I do I don't think you're
better off if there's no captain at the
helm and that's not to take away from
the people who are actually out there
protesting every single one of them
that's a good thing but you know you the
civil rights movement needed guys like
Malcolm X and Martin Luther King jr.
because you need to take this amorphous
rage that people feel and that's what it
is
it's a morphix rage I'm mad about stuff
that's what I'm mad about things are bad
and I'm mad well you need somebody to
step up and say let me let me explain
perfectly and crystallize why you're
really upset
and let me tell you the solutions Martin
Luther King came along and said what we
need is the Civil Rights Act what we
need is the Voting Rights Act and then
he went on to say his further arguments
were we need unionization we need a
living wage we need we need free health
care he said any just inequality in
health care is the worst kind of
injustice we need to end all these wars
the US government is the greatest
purveyor of violence my government is
the greatest purveyor of violence on
earth today so you had somebody come
along we said yes we're all mad you got
that amorphous feeling of anger anger
are vague rage but you need somebody who
says we're gonna color within the lines
here we're not gonna take the [ __ ]
crayon like a child and yeah no you're
gonna color within the lines here's
exactly what we're mad at and here's
exactly what the solutions are so I
think I think that's why you had a
decrease man you had a decrease because
this isn't issues based and when you
just and come on keep it real women's
March it's a strong identity politics
thing CNN did an article I read through
it I was cringing the entire time where
they spoke to some people who marched in
the women's March said why are you why
are you doing this so many of them were
like well you know I'm I'm for I'm for
women and people of color and the LGBTQ
community okay that's good
but what does that mean give me exactly
what so what do you mean so how exactly
are you for the LGBT community what does
that mean now if you said I'm in favor
there's over 20 states that still allow
legal discrimination against the LGBTQ
community they could fire you if they're
uncomfortable with you being gay so we
need anti-discrimination protections in
those places I'd say great that's a good
reason to March wonderful but when you
just say I'm for people or downtrodden
yes that's called virtue signaling I'm
just I'm Ford these people and these
things and then and then you know
there's a great there was a great
science
Nataly sure is a DSA member I think in
LA and she was holding a sign that said
single-payer is feminist or it said
Medicare for all is feminist now look I
know some people might look at that man
like why do you have to add the identity
politics angle to it but stop and think
about it because that's actually a
brilliant move because what it does is
it takes the issue of Medicare for all
and it personalizes it to many people
who are in that March in their primary
concern is identity politics now you and
I might disagree that the main focus
should be identity politics but as I
always say the solution to the all the
problems against minority communities
and downtrodden communities it's
universal solutions all the solutions so
oh you know the the criminal justice
system is racist because it
disproportionately uses the death
penalty against people of color for the
same crime when why people commit it
mandatory minimums are racist because it
usually are used against people of color
even if a white person commits the same
crime they don't get the mandatory
minimum so what's the solution in both
those cases get rid of the death penalty
get rid of mandatory minimums a
universal solution to a problem that can
narrowly be defined as you know a
problem affecting people of color so
that's exactly what Natalie Shar is
doing with that sign hey
medicare-for-all is a feminist issue
well of the 45,000 people that die every
year because they don't have access to
basic health care over half of them are
women so you say oh there you go it's a
universal solution to an issue that's
being framed in an identity politics way
now again if you're using that kind of
messaging to appeal to people and show
them the way to the right policies I'll
take it I'll take it you know in my mind
my sign would just say Medicare for all
but if you want to say it's a feminist
issue and that makes it so that Medicare
for all gets more momentum behind it and
guess people say yes this is exactly
what we want in the same way that vague
orphis Ange against a racist system that
Martin Luther King said Voting Rights
Act Civil Rights Act that's what we want
you take the vague anger of we're [ __ ]
really mad and say oh and here's the
solution fine fine fine let's do that so
but my point is you can't just when I
read through that CNN article I was like
this is a problem because you ask people
hey why are you marching you know I
don't disabled people aren't treated
fairly women and people of color aren't
treated fairly I'm for change you've got
it's got to be more than that or else
people will go you're just blowing off
steam that's what you're doing you're
out there going I don't like Trump okay
what's your solution yeah and you can't
just say oh I don't know Hillary some
politic no what exactly are you in favor
of cuz it's not you don't get to just
give up on all this when your side wins
because if you do that and you don't
pressure your side they ain't gonna do
deke mcgee-zax for you and that's why
you need strong leaders in a movement
and let me just show you my tweet on
this because this really encapsulate how
I feel about it
all of this grassroots anti Trump fervor
is a great sign now we must harness this
energy to real solutions for the 99% get
money out of politics medicare for all
free college living wage and the wars
new New Deal and the drug war and much
more so some might say I'm wrong but I
think that if you had a focus for the
women's March that went beyond just
women's March I think that could have
done better
I do and like for example a
medicare-for-all March that is the
solution that's the solution to our
health care 100% so I don't give a [ __ ]
if you say you know Medicare for all is
a [ __ ] feminist issue or Medicare for
all is a black issue or I don't care how
you message it but if that's the main
core of what you're arguing for I'm
[ __ ] right there with you but when you
just women's March okay and then and
then and
then I don't just want it like I was
thinking in my head how many people are
out there doing this March but in their
mind they're like okay I'm out here
doing this March and that's it like that
the like in other words the March is an
end in and of itself you know what I
mean I think there were some people who
were fine with that notion and other
people were like this is like getting a
little bit pregnant it shouldn't be a
thing like oh I'm a little bit pregnant
yeah we're marching for stuff and things
yeah that's what but no if you were out
there medicare-for-all we're not gonna
[ __ ] stop until we get it you know
living wage we're not gonna stop until
we get it by the way that's another
issue or if you wanted to frame it as a
feminist issue you can why most people
making the minimum wage which is not a
living wage are women so if you wanted
to hold the sign living wage as a
feminist a fine do it go ahead living
wage in my mind is an issue that's good
for all Americans like I said Universal
solutions for every problem but that's
um that's marketing that would work and
you would have a goal you'd have a
purpose you wouldn't just be a little
bit pregnant you would be [ __ ]
pregnant and you don't stop until you
have that baby that baby being a living
wage or medicare-for-all or ending the
wars or what-have-you
so you have to harness this energy
leaders have to harness this energy
towards productive solutions and what
happened over the weekend is when I
tweeted that it did decent in terms of
numbers for retweets and likes but there
was a congressman who actually responded
to me and he said you're right it's
start and this starts with electing you
know going out and voting and electing
the right people he said something of
that effect
now the congressman who said that to me
is Ted Lou I didn't respond to Ted Lou
but I part of me wanted to respond to
him because Ted Lou is one of the first
politicians who is relentlessly pushing
this new Red Scare he's all the time he
talks about Trump Putin Trump in fact it
says in his [ __ ] Twitter bio and I
don't take orders from Vladimir Putin so
my response to Ted Lou when he says that
to me is no congressman no it starts
with you a Democratic congressman and
all the Democrats putting these issues
Center shut the [ __ ] up with your Red
Scare and oh my god Russia Russia Russia
Russia Russia because there's no policy
ends to that that are that are positive
for the people there's no policy as to
that the only logical policy conclusions
from you fear mongering against Russia
all the time is an escalation with
Russia more sanctions against Russia
pushing to the brink of war with Russia
so instead of you putting that issue
front and center
you put those issues I just laid out
front and center living wage Medicare
for all and the wars and the drug war
new New Deal so on and so forth you
shouldn't be telling me oh it starts
with voting no it starts with you saying
these things to make us want to vote for
you
we don't want vote for you when you're
[ __ ] message listen Josh a [ __ ]
something no it starts with you
congressman it starts with you and
that's my message to the protesters as
well for the women's March I think
you're overwhelmingly you're good people
and you mean well but you have to
sharpen your message or else it
nothing's gonna happen you're not gonna
win if you're if all you're expressing
is amorphous rage and anti-trump anger
then all you're gonna get is amorphous
politicians who are anti Trump and what
does that mean it means nothing cuz you
get rid of Trump and what you have you
still have the system in place that got
us Trump in the first place
so again by and large I think the people
we're dealing with here good people and
they mean well but you need leadership
and you need to sharpen that message
because that's not amorphous vacuous
message list identity driven drivel is
not a long-term solution
it's called blowing off steam and it
makes you feel good but at the end of
the day it changes nothing
Fareed Zakaria did a curious segment on
the issue of immigration that I wanted
to share with you let's watch the
central issue feeding populism around
the globe is immigration that's why you
still see right-wing populism in such
countries as Germany Holland and Sweden
where economic growth is strong
manufacturing is still vibrant and
inequality has not risen dramatically
Donald Trump remember beats 16 talented
Republican candidates because he
outflanked them all on one issue
immigration meanwhile Democrats continue
to move left on economics believing that
this will make them more credible
populist but polling shows that the
public is already with them on economic
issues where it and the working class
especially differs with them is on
immigration and yet the party is now
more extreme on this topic than it has
ever been positions that dozens of
Democratic senators took on immigration
10 years ago are now totally rejected by
almost every Democratic Party leader
most for example would have agreed that
America's current mix of immigration
skews too heavily toward family
unification and needs to attract more
immigrants with skills now none will
speak on the issue the party today
embraces sanctuary cities suggesting
that local authorities should ignore
federal laws or even defy federal
authorities who try to enforce the law
of the land imagine of Republican
mayor's did the same with regard to laws
they don't like on say guns or abortion
it is difficult to be moderate on any
topic these days most of all immigration
Donald Trump discusses the issue in ways
that to me seem racist factions of the
Republican Party have become ugly and
mean-spirited in tone and temper
demeaning immigrants encouraging
nativism and bigotry to compromise with
these kind of attitudes seems
distasteful even immoral and yet the
issue is one that should allow for some
sensible middle ground the late Edward
Kennedy was one of the most liberal
senators in the country Senator John
McCain is a staunch conservative and yet
they were able to agree on a set of
compromises in the mid 2000s that would
have largely resolved
America's immigration deadlock and the
rage surrounding it let's be honest the
scale and speed of immigration over the
last few decades is a real issue
just since 1990 the share of
foreign-born people in America has gone
from 9% to 15%
it's nearly doubled in Germany and the
Netherlands it's nearly tripled in
Denmark most of the new immigrants do
come from cultures that are more distant
and different and societies can only
take so much change in a generation if
mainstream politicians do not recognize
these realities and insist that those
who speak of them are racists they will
only push the public in its desperation
to embrace the real racists of which
there are many most of that I don't
agree with
he made some points that are decent but
overall that argument is not compelling
to me like oh you better be super far
right-wing on immigration or else the
public will embrace people who are
really far-right on immigration what so
you should be wrong about stuff first so
that the the public doesn't embrace the
other people who are also wrong I don't
that's oh god that's just a weird
argument and also there is a supreme
irony of Fareed Zakaria whose brown
arguing like a lot of immigrants coming
in here man we probably have a Doosan
about this a lot of people from
different cultures you know you know
okay that's bizarre so let me let me
break down his argument there
he says the Democrats are more extreme
on immigration than ever and what he
means is in a left-wing way and he said
that hey come on you need to be more
reasonable on this stuff Obama broke the
deportation record I don't know what you
mean he's so in a weird way he's right
but he's right in the opposite way that
he thinks he is he's like all the
Democrats are more extreme on
immigration than ever yeah they're more
extreme in a right wing direction he
thinks they're more extreme in like a
left
direction.i what the [ __ ] are you
talking about Ronald Reagan did amnesty
Ronald Reagan so the old school
Republicans were in many ways to the
left of the debt
today's Democrats on immigration so what
a weird argument he's making it's so
wrong that it's stunning now furthermore
if you say well maybe Kylie you know
he's not talking about Obama and he's
just talking about these Democrats in
the context of this current debate and
this government shutdown okay let's see
what the Democratic position is tweet
from Dick Durbin our bipartisan deal
gives the president everything he asked
for border security family unification
Visa Lottery DREAM Act this is what
compromise is all about Democrats and
Republicans support it why wouldn't
Congress pass this deal I think they
gave him everything so what do you mean
the Republicans are saying no oh we're
not against daca but we refuse to
support any spending bill that has daca
in it so then how can you blame the
Democrats for not being reasonable on
immigration or not being right-wing
enough on immigration they get dick
Durbin say hey we're giving you
everything you want Chuck Schumer same
thing oh yeah well whatever take I don't
care
so what [ __ ] he was talking about he's
saying Democrats are more extreme than
ever on immigration and he's not saying
in a right wing direction he's saying
they're too extreme in a left wing
direction I how can you read that gives
the president everything he's asked for
and go up these [ __ ] Democrats
they're too unreasonable on these issues
ah ah come on for Reid what are you
doing man what are you doing and listen
where I differ from many people who
watch this show is I don't I'm totally
indifferent to a wall it's super
inconsequential it's just a symbolic
[ __ ] thing it's whatever I couldn't
care less I'm not for the wall but I'm
also not massively against it I don't
view it as like oh it's a [ __ ] wall
you put a fence between you and your
neighbor's house whatever it's a [ __ ]
fence between you or your neighbor's
house I don't care about that but I care
about everything else in the debate and
on everything else the Democrats have
moved to the right not to the left
and they're even saying now we'll give
you the wall - so I don't know what more
you want from Democrats and then also
let's let's keep it real here
furry just made some stuff up he just
made some stuff up there so he said
Trump won because of immigration he
outflanked all the other Republicans on
immigration that's one of the reasons
why he won but these guys everybody
loves to everybody in the establishment
media loves to underplay Trump's
economic populism as campaign rhetoric
he's been the opposite since he got
elected that's a given he's been
horrible on these issues but he was
super left-wing on trade medicare
medicaid social securities and I'm not
gonna cut them I'm not gonna cut them
there were even times where he said
we're gonna cover everybody with health
care that's what we're gonna do there's
only one way to do that it's a medicare
for all so you had to interpret it from
what he's saying and you had to believe
him he even though he's a ranting idiot
who's shooting from the hip but he was
pretty left-wing on economic stuff so he
married the xenophobia and bigotry that
the right-wing base loves so he fired up
the base but then he he put a heavy dose
of economic populism in there railed
against TPP railed against NAFTA you
know sounded like he was gonna be for
workers and then that that attracted
everybody else so that's why you won but
know these just given credit to the to
the anti-immigrant rhetoric that's not
you can't say that that's the main
reason he won because you're just making
that up there's nothing to back that up
and then the argument he makes about
sanctuary cities is also [ __ ] now I
didn't know this until recently but when
I researched it I was like oh that
actually makes perfect sense apparently
the reason for sanctuary cities is not
like Maha we will go against the federal
government and and go in the opposite
direction and protect immigrants
muah-ha-ha know the reason for sanctuary
cities are it actually lowers crime
rates because what happens is if
somebody lives in a high crime
neighborhood and there's a crime that's
committed and they know something if
they are not documented immigrant
they're not going to talk to the police
because then the police find out oh
you're
document immigrant and then maybe they
get deported so people are scared
shitless that if they're upstanding
citizens and they're out there it you
know in the sunlight for everybody to
see that they'll get deported the reason
for sanctuary cities is those people now
report crimes and they go I know I'm not
gonna get deported this is a sanctuary
city so I just saw a [ __ ] violent
crime happen so I'm gonna talk to the
police so I'm gonna tell them hey look
this is what I saw and now they don't
don't worry about getting deported
so it's not like the Republicans portray
it as oh the the Democrats just want to
protect undocumented immigrants because
they're in favor of criminals or
something ridiculous like no the whole
reason for it is actually the opposite
it's to reduce crime because the
statistics bear out that when you have
the sanctuary cities they're able to
stop a lot more crime because then the
undocumented immigrants step out and go
I saw a crime and let me tell you about
it and they're upstanding citizens so I
don't like come on for Reid you're
supposed to be a smart guy who like is
read up on all this [ __ ] and knows the
arguments for it but you're not you
[ __ ] glossed right over that you
probably don't even know it and then the
final point is when he says like imagine
if Republicans did this on abortion and
gun rights so he's saying Oh Democrats
violate a federal law brazenly imagine
if Republicans did this on abortion and
gun rights okay I will cuz they do that
like [ __ ] he's acting like Republicans
are reasonable and they always follow
federal law what the [ __ ] are you
talking about how many how many states
red states have trap laws targeted
restriction of abortion procedure which
basically bans abortion without just
saying the words we are banning abortion
in this state so what they'll do is
they'll come up with arbitrary
guidelines oh your ceilings need to be
15 feet tall they need to be 8 feet or
more wide and oh [ __ ] yours doesn't meet
the code I guess we have to shut you
down
they say oh even if you're a clinic that
just gives out an abortion pill sorry
you need to have a surgical procedure
room as if you you're giving abortions
surgical abortions and they go we don't
we don't do that here they go doesn't
our laws say you have to have a surgical
procedure room and if you don't we're
gonna shut you down this is what they do
they pass you know six week abortion ban
laws in some red states that's
unconstitutional through and through
totally against federal law you have to
it 23 weeks I believe is a lie you could
regulate it after 23 weeks but they go
no we're gonna regulate it we're gonna
say we're gonna ban it after six weeks
that's unconstitutional that's against
federal law but the Republicans do it
anyway on gun rights of course you have
red states where you know oh are we
supposed to do a background check
ttz sorry we didn't do it anyway here's
your weapon were you talking about for
Reid what kind of Pollyanna issue
[ __ ] is this like he knows like the
Republicans follow federal law or the
Democrats need to follow it to Jesus
Christ man so yeah I don't know what the
[ __ ] he's talking about I really don't
now listen overall what's my take on
immigration I've spoken about this
before I fancy myself a moderate on
immigration so I just told you I
genuinely don't give a [ __ ] about the
wall it means nothing and I think people
who act like it means something you're
just being silly because it doesn't mean
anything it means nothing
guess what even if you build the wall
people gonna find a way under it they're
gonna find a way around it they're
people gonna get in this country most
undocumented migrants in this country
take a [ __ ] plane you want to know
why cuz the years not [ __ ] 1876 so you
can get in by taking a plane so it
doesn't that's symbolic [ __ ] I don't
care about that but also in my opinion
look I would deport criminals no problem
deporting criminals whatsoever I don't
think that's a problem I don't think
that's a sign of bigotry by any stretch
of the imagination
I think that's common sense but most
Democrats are in favor of deporting
criminals too so they're not you know
totally off on this but what I would do
is for all the non criminals amnesty
amnesty if you're here and you're you
know a people immigrants by and large
come here to try to create a better life
they're not coming up mwah
we will rob from [ __ ] Thurston they
don't do that that's [ __ ] a
caricature that's [ __ ] they don't do
that so for people who are not criminals
amnesty for them and then from then on
I'm fine with border protection
you know you want to do some sort of
catch-and-release [ __ ] after that fine
do it but for everybody who's already
here in his established here as so many
people are what are we doing we're gonna
[ __ ] sorry you've been here for eight
years and you have a job and you're very
productive and you know you've
assimilated well but we're gonna kick
you out for reasons I don't know why
we're gonna kick you out we're just
gonna kick you out oh your name happens
to be Jose and you have dark skin it's
I'm not trying to kick you out because
of the brownness of your skin I'm just
trying to kick you out because of
something law and order even though
you're a law-abiding citizen and you
have assimilated and you're very
productive and you're doing well here so
that's my take on it amnesty for all the
people who aren't criminals deport the
criminals you can do border protection I
have no problem with that whatsoever so
I am myself a moderate on immigration
but the point is and the reason why Furi
drawing is he's acting like the
democrats are super far lefty on this
when they just said hey trump you could
have your wall the only thing we want is
protection for dreamers which is a
[ __ ] no-brainer kids people both here
as kids and no [ __ ] saying whether or
not they were coming here you're gonna
deport them when all they know is
America so furries wrong because he's
acting like the Democrats are super
left-wing when they're not they're not I
don't know any Democrats who are saying
I want blanket amnesty for everybody in
the country protect the criminals like
what no nobody's saying that so why are
you pretending that the Democrats are
super far left-wing and they're the
unreasonable ones and they're the most
extreme on immigration what do you have
a Republican Party that's saying we're
against dreamers people brought here as
kit under the age of 16 their people
bought here eight years old brought to
us through no choice of their own
they're eight they're brought by their
parents they've become very productive
something like over 99% of them are good
law-abiding citizens you know some
really high percentage of them work so
on and so forth Republicans are
pretending like oh no we're not against
them but then any spending bill that has
protection for dreamers in a drug know
we're against that so why isn't your
rant targeted only at the right because
they're the extreme ones on immigration
I don't know where the [ __ ] you're
getting all this [ __ ] from and there is
a supreme irony in you being a brown man
and acting like these you know these
immigrants man what are we gonna do
about them freed what [ __ ] are you
talking about man what are you doing
here okay so yeah he's mostly wrong he's
mostly wrong
the only thing where there's a grain of
truth is the idea that moderation on
this issue is a good thing it's a
reasonable thing and I'm in favor of
moderation on this issue but where he's
wrong is assuming the Democrats are
super far left wait that's just not true
they're nowhere near super far left
doing on this issue
not even close in fact old-school
Republicans like Reagan in many ways
were to the left of Democrats on the
issue of immigration so you totally
misdiagnosed this
so we had a government shutdown occur
and that means Congress couldn't agree
on a spending bill so Republicans are
trying to blame it all on Democrats
Democrats are trying to blame it on
Republicans I'm gonna break down for you
exactly where the blame lies now the
most important fact is Republicans
weren't even close so they didn't even
get 50 votes
never mind 60 votes so you had Jeff
Flake Mike Lee Lindsey Graham and Rand
Paul vote against the spending bill so
all of the all of the grandstanding
against Democrats doesn't make much
sense since you didn't even get over 50
votes for your side so I don't you can't
even get your side together but you're
gonna blame Democrats for not voting for
it now again the specifics are
interesting and we'll get to that but
first let me tell you who's affected by
the government shutdown so let me tell
you exactly what that means because
people like to throw that around without
giving you the context and all the
specifics of it so take a look at this
700,000 undocumented immigrants who are
part of the deferred action for
childhood arrivals program daca will be
affected as there's currently no fix in
place ahead for the March 5th deadline 9
million children who are under the
children's health insurance program
whose parents who usually earn too much
to qualify for Medicaid but not enough
to afford private health coverage will
have less certainty about the future of
their health care about 1.3 million
active-duty military will be expected to
work potentially without pay the
military is currently paid through
February 1st in the 2013 government
shutdown about 850,000 government
employees were furloughed each day and
there could be a similar number this
time around 1.8 7 million civilian
government workers could be exempt from
furlough including the workers at the
Transportation Security Administration
and food and safety inspectors border
patrol officers and federal prison
guards up to 417 National Park sites
could be closed though the Trump
administration is going to try
to allow limited access wherever
possible Interior Department spokeswoman
Heather swift told CNN 19 Smithsonian
museums could be closed now this is the
first time in US history that there was
a government shutdown when one party
controls everything so the Republicans
obviously have the presidency with
Donald Trump they have the Senate and
they have the house they control
everything and they still weren't able
to get a spending bill passed first time
in US government history so again keep
that in mind because that's an important
fact that's being overlooked now the
main argument coming from Republicans at
least at this moment is well the
Democrats they don't they're holding our
troops hostage I can't believe they're
holding our troops hostage and that's
simply not true
so Mike Pence did a speech where he lied
Paul Ryan has been lying about this on
Twitter Ted Cruz exact same thing where
they're claiming Democrats don't even
want to pay the troops to fight for
illegal immigrants Democrats are not
even paying the troops well you're gonna
see how true that is
in this clip so yesterday when the
government had already shut down but in
the morning they had they were trying to
work out a deal and you had Senator
Claire McCaskill take to the floor and
say the following and listen to Mitch
McConnell's reaction senator from
Missouri mr. president I am this
shouldn't take very long but I was most
disappointed tonight when the president
United States put out a statement that
tried to divide us based on party when
it came to support of our military there
is no such division everyone in this
chamber knows it and so as we have in
other instances where we have had a
shutdown I remember in 2013 we did this
right off the bat I want to make sure
that tonight we send a very clear signal
that we don't want one
to pass with there being any uncertainty
of any soldier anywhere in the world
that they will be paid for the valiant
work they do on behalf of our national
security I ask unanimous consent that
the Senate proceed to the immediate
consideration of calendar number 36 HR
1301 that the amendment at the desk
providing for continuing appropriations
for pay and death penalty for members of
the Armed Services be considered and
agreed to the bill as amended be
considered read a third time and passed
and the motions to reconsider be
considered made and laid upon the table
with no intervening action or debate is
there objection mr. Paden reserving the
right to object what therefore I've J so
there you have it the the main argument
coming from Republicans now is they're
not the Democrats these goddamn
Democrats to defend illegal immigrants
they're willing to not pay our glorious
troops good well no they actually
proposed doing exactly that
Andy you rejected it you rejected it
Mitch McConnell is not in favor of
paying the troops but what's most
stunning about this shutdown is the
Democrats did the typical weak spineless
democratic thing of giving the
Republicans everything they want and
then the Republicans still said no and
spit in their eye so the main crux of
this comes down to whether or not
there's going to be protections for the
dreamers the Republicans keep saying
that they're not against the dreamers
but then they're refusing to to do
protections for them in any spending
bill so it they won't they won't just
say it but the Democrats have laid out
the red carpet in fact I'm gonna show
you this tweet here from dick Durbin
take a look at that tweet we're gonna be
discussing that a lot more today that
tweet but dick Durbin rolls out hey
listen this we're giving you everything
you want even the [ __ ] border wall
they say okay yeah sure no problem we're
willing to the border wall if there's
protections
for the dreamers and the Republicans are
still saying no so the Republican
position is you give me everything you
get nothing and then I'm gonna scold you
for not supporting it what the [ __ ] is
that what is that I mean that's it's
amazing how ridiculous they are and just
detach from reality they are but also
how powerful this is as a strategy so
part of their strategy just lying I mean
what they do is they'll just they try to
do hashtag Schumer shut down and push it
on social media of course that's it's
not catching on as much as they'd like
but they've made it a debate they've now
made it a debate the polls show the
American people blame Republicans for
the shutdown way more than the Democrats
but the Republicans are being so
aggressive in the framing and the
marketing that they're saying no it
really is the Democrats fault and now
Pete some people are shrugging their
shoulders for this maybe it is the
Democrats fault the Republicans keep
saying it's the Democrats fault but this
is their strategy and this is this is
what they're good at now the Democrats
on the other hand do the exact wrong
approach so the Democrats are the person
who walks in to buy a let's say a
fifteen thousand dollar used car and
they go up to the salesman and they go
how much is this oh it's it's fifteen
thousand okay I'll give you sixteen
thousand wait what why do what are you
talking about why would you do that that
it's fifteen thousand that's the sticker
price you're offering a buff sticker
price right away I don't understand that
Schumer was bragging about the wall
representative Gutierrez was bragging
about the wall dick durbin yeah sure
will give you a wall no problem we'll
give you everything you want just the
only thing we want is daca in return and
they still say no and the Republicans
still say no by the way Democrats the
way you're supposed to fight and the way
you're supposed to negotiate because if
do you want to win in the next election
or not apparently they don't want to win
the way you negotiate is you walk up to
a used-car sell to how much is this
oh it's $15,000 that's nice I'll give
you a nine that's how you negotiate you
negotiate and by the way you're
negotiating from a position of strength
in this I haven't heard a single
Democrat reference poll numbers in
guards to the policies that they're
fighting for the Republicans love they
just keep [ __ ] smearing feces all
over the face of the Democrats and
they're like yeah you're legal
immigrants you want to protect illegal
immigrants and you screw it over our
troops to do it not a single Democrat
has said whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
that's nonsense we're fighting for
people who were brought here as children
all they know is America they're wildly
productive they're getting educated they
have jobs these are good people
and by the way seventy to eighty percent
of the American people support them 70
to 80 percent of the men are with us
so you Republican Party need to go out
there and explain to the American people
why you're fascists and tyrants and
authoritarians and you want to override
the Democratic will of seventy to eighty
percent of the American people this is
supposed to be a constitutional republic
and a representative democracy do your
[ __ ] job and represent the people but
no the Democrats go listen all we want
is one thing Dhaka that's it that's all
we want is one thing we're gonna give
you everything you want outside of that
and the Republicans go no we want a
hundred percent of what we want and we
want you to fall in line and vote for it
too it's amazing the political debate
they were having in the country and this
explains why the Overton Window which is
the spectrum of debate and conversation
that's deemed appropriate is
significantly far right so we have the
Overton Window in Washington DC
among the establishment in the United
States the right fringe is fascism and
the left fringe is moderate Republican
ISM is being a center-right person
centrist you know at at most so this is
a encapsulation of everything that's
wrong with with the debate in our
country at the moment so if I if I were
in the Democrats shoes what would I do
I would say this is this is a win across
the board for us because look the polls
show the American people will blame
Republicans I would point that out
non-stop and say you're not gonna pull
one over on the American people they
know whose fault it is you control every
branch of government you can't even hold
your own
caucus and you're gonna [ __ ] say it's
our problem no this is your problem this
is on your shoulders the American people
already agree with you make that case
even more so even more people agree with
you and then I would say I wouldn't say
just give me daca and that would be it
they're spitting in your eye no matter
what no matter what they're saying no no
you give us everything no so okay you
want to play that game let's play that
game how about you're not gonna get a
single Democratic vote unless unless you
give us daca which is 70 to 80 percent
favorability chip children health
insurance program which is wildly
popular net neutrality 83% of the
American people are in favor of net
neutrality why are you not adding this
in the bill nope you have to do
protections for net neutrality or you
get zero Democratic votes zero
Democratic votes let me say one more
time zero Democratic votes not a single
Democrat is going to vote for you is
going to vote for this spending bill
unless you have net neutrality in there
because we're on the side of the
American people you are not on the side
of the American people you're on the
side of the Internet service providers
who are destroying our free and open
Internet and I would say Oh protection
for Social Security Medicare you're
gonna add provision in this spending
bill that there will be zero cuts to
Social Security and Medicare or you're
not gonna get a single Democratic vote
not one not one not one now you can say
we're extreme but that's a lie you're
extreme look at the poll numbers the
American people are overwhelmingly on
our side so we are representing the
people you are not representing the
people so if you give them a list and by
the way I'm being overly kind by only
having those things on my list those
four things on my list because what
happens like I said the people already
blame Republicans for the shutdown and
don't blame the Democrats for the
shutdown and then when you take these
issues and you go out there and message
on those issues you know what happens
every single person in the country who
cares about net neutrality deeply which
is a lot of [ __ ] people goes that's
it I'm voting for Democrats in the next
election they're standing on principle
and they're saying I refuse to give you
a single vote in unless you add net
neutrality into this bill people who
older people who lean right go hey wait
a second they're saying add protections
for Medicare and Social Security I
thought you guys everybody was in favor
that already why are the Republicans not
signing on to that well I guess I have
to go over Democrats in the next
election because obviously they're the
only people who really want to protect
Social Security Medicare they're making
it a big thing in the budget
negotiations you know every single
dreamer every single American citizen
who cares about the issue of immigration
is gonna go okay finally you're standing
up for something 78% of the American
people support this chip health care for
children I mean for [ __ ] sake if you
can't make a stand there that people are
gonna go what the [ __ ] are we are we
waiting on here I mean what what is
wrong with the Democrats Adam Johnson
made a great point on Twitter he said
nobody shows up to a pep rally for a tie
and that's effectively what the
Democrats come out in support of us and
we will we'll give the Republicans
almost everything they want nobody's
gonna want to vote for you nobody's
gonna care [ __ ] it we'll stay home there
nobody's fighting for us anyway so it's
just pathetic what the Democrats are
doing here give the Republicans
everything they want the Republicans
still say no one spit in your eye and
then they go out and lie about it it
really is amazing
you could you could come out of this
government shutdown having them on the
[ __ ] ropes they're already kind of
scared about what's gonna happen in the
midterm elections you could have them
[ __ ] their pants and for everybody
who says no this is bad politics how
there is a government shutdown in 2013
and you know what happened as a result
of it the Republicans still ended up
winning in a landslide in the next
election so the idea of like yeah you're
being too obstinate well the Republicans
were being too often in 2013 and what
happened they still ended up winning in
a landslide
perhaps because people on the right went
oh they're willing to fight for what
they believe in the [ __ ] polls
already bear that out that people would
rather have you fight for what you
believe in then just I don't know do
compromise bipartisanship deal
and then that and then we're good no
those things are not inherently good
those things are not inherently virtuous
bipartisanship making a deal compromise
what's in the [ __ ] compromise that's
what matters and the Republicans say
give us everything and shut the [ __ ] up
so your response is the Democrats should
be how about you give us everything and
shut the [ __ ] up how about that [ __ ]
how about that well then they go well
you don't have the numbers to do that
okay but I will after I'm done with this
argument because I'm gonna win this
[ __ ] argument because the people want
what I want
they're so weak and they're so
ineffectual and the Republicans are so
[ __ ] stupid and brash and cocky sure
of themselves
it's just Oh God our government is
[ __ ] broken it really is broken so I
don't you know there was murmurs but
right before I came on air I haven't
seen the details of it that Mitch
McConnell offered a deal you know to
Schumer I haven't seen the details of it
but from what I have seen about it on
Twitter people are saying if they accept
this deal they're the most pathetic
people on earth so you know chances are
what if I'm guessing here maybe they did
something like we'll give you some sort
of compromise on dreamers like hey we
only protect some of the dreamers
400,000 of them or some sort of
compromise where they give part of chip
and part of the dream actor and then you
know it's classic classic Republican
politics steak the furthest right
position possible and then demand that
the Democrats meet you halfway and then
when the Democrats meet you halfway
you're already on the far right so
what's the point so that would be my
guess but I'll have to see the details
and the specifics of the bill before
really rendering a judgment on it but
listen if I'm the Democrats
those are my demands and I'm not budging
a [ __ ] inch and so that means you
have to do daca you have to do chip you
have to do net neutrality and you have
to do protection for Social Security or
Medicare and then by the way you know
what happens when you negotiate from a
position of strength the people are
overwhelmingly with you you're
negotiating from a position of strength
the America people already blame the
Republicans for the shutdown you know
what happens in that situation the end
result is they give you chip and they
give you daca
which is really what the Democrats
wanted all along
but in just traditional democratic
stupidity that they started from that
negotiation point they said all we want
is chip and daca and we're gonna give
you everything else including the
[ __ ] border wall well then well now
you have to negotiate from your starting
position and you have to cave even more
which is why we're in this position
right now but if your starting position
was dr. chip net neutrality protecting
Social Security or Medicare then the
compromise position becomes protect daca
and chip so they're so bad and look it's
at the point where when you look at this
stuff
it's hard to not conclude that they
might be bad on purpose
I hope everybody's ready to get angry
today because that's what's gonna happen
take a look at this story from Politico
Tillerson US will maintain a military
presence in Syria this is an official
announcement of we're gonna stay in
Syria indefinitely we're just gonna stay
there a country that didn't attack us
yeah we're just gonna invade it and
occupy it and never leave this is why I
get frustrated and this is why I'm
really tough on the so-called resistance
because they love resisting when it's
trump's vulgar language they love
resisting when it's on the surface
Russia Russia Russia Russia so whenever
it's not policy related right yeah let
me let's just resist resist resist look
at my [ __ ] pink cat or whatever the
[ __ ] but when it's actual policy
crickets [ __ ] crickets [ __ ] that's
what I hear right now so here's the
here's an opportunity where the
mainstream media can go wall-to-wall
anti Trump coverage and they would be
right to go wall-to-wall anti Trump
coverage oh my god look at what he's
doing
invasion occupation of a country that
didn't attack us do the American people
want this no the American people don't
[ __ ] want this look at the polls they
don't want this you could resist wall to
wall on the mainstream media the
Democratic Party every elected Democrat
in the country can be out there saying
what are we doing what are we doing they
didn't even vote on this war there
wasn't even a vote that's that's against
the Constitution
that's a violation of the Constitution
you have to vote on a war Congress
approves war but no the administration
says oh we'll just go in there and we'll
pretend like this is all linked to
[ __ ] 9/11 9/11 Vedic Syria in goddamn
2016 2017 2018 is linked to 9/11 in 2001
when Al Qaeda barely exists anymore
there are jihadis Shore but other of
jihadists the ones the ones in Syria are
they the ones who attacked the United
States on 9/11 no are we even fighting
them in Syria no they're the ones were
de facto aligned with in Syria because
those are the rebels who are fighting
back against Assad the Syrian government
Democrats and [ __ ] mums the word
nobody's saying anything
this strunk resist what we do is resist
we're so strong where the opposition but
then when this happens nobody does
anything and then they wonder why you're
not super excited to go vote for them
maybe cuz you're not offering us
anything you're not doing anything the
American people want Democrats voted
with the Republicans to deregulate Wall
Street again that just recently happened
now we have this situation and by the
way even when they actually do oppose
Trump they have no backbone
they have no spine they already folded
once on daca they already Foley once on
it that's an area where they actually
disagree with them yeah we're in favor
of the dreamers they're not in favor of
the dreamers okay what are you gonna do
about it sorry we already folded once
around Christmas are we gonna fight now
maybe I don't know it depends on the
mood we're and we'll see well here's an
area do you have any idea you could win
an election on this issue alone you know
how easy it is these guys want endless
war play the clips of Donald Trump what
are we doing in the Middle East this is
what he used to say what are we doing in
the Middle East
we're wasting all of our money there our
infrastructure gets a grade of D plus
let's rebuild our infrastructure with
the money we're wasting overseas
why are we wasting this money it's so
stupid it makes no sense meanwhile our
soldiers are also dying in these
conflicts overseas countless civilians
are dying overseas which makes people
hate America even more and radicalizes
more people what are we doing bring the
troops home bring the troops don't play
clips of him saying that show the poles
of the American people only 17% of
Americans still want to be in
Afghanistan we're still there and that
was as of 2013 I bet that number is even
lower now probably 10% of Americans who
want to be in Afghanistan talk about the
7 trillion dollars wasted in Iraq 2
trillion dollars wasted in Afghanistan
why are we why are you not talking about
this stuff why are you not saying we are
a hundred percent against this
indefinitely saying in Syria are you
kidding me because they're just not
they're not against it they're not
against it it's not like Obama's hands
were clean on this front
he went into Syria too he was doing
drone strikes too he was bombing seven
countries Trump escalated it to eight
countries he threw he threw Niger in the
mix let me give you some of what's said
here Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on
Wednesday indicated that America will
maintain an indefinite military presence
in Syria to fight terrorist groups we'll
get to that in a second stand up to
Iran's growing influence and pave the
way for an end to the regime of Syrian
leader Bashar al-assad
all right let's pause what they just
said there makes no sense so what
they're saying is we're gonna stay in
Syria to be against everybody that's
where they just said because how are you
gonna go against Iran and Assad but also
against terrorist groups I Got News for
you it's Iran and Assad who are fighting
the terrorist groups you don't know that
but they do know that they're just
trying to pull the wool over your eyes
cuz they think you're an ignorant
American who's not gonna look into this
[ __ ] listen I don't care what the [ __ ]
you think about Iran or Assad you don't
have to like them you shouldn't like
them I don't like them but the fact of
the matter remains they are the ones who
are fighting the jihadis on the ground
in Syria that's a fact
all the store
we recently covered about how Isis
genuinely is on the brink of defeat and
they're running scared in the desert why
do you think that is it's because of the
Syrian army and it's because of the
Kurds and it's because of the Shia
militias and Iran it's because of the
Iraqi army it's because of the people on
the ground they're fighting them not
because of us
I know Trump likes to take credit for it
it's not because of us so how are you
gonna fight the people who are the
terrorists but also the people who are
fighting the terrorists and act like
these aren't contradictory goals those
are 100% contradictory goals so that
doesn't what they said already doesn't
make sense we're gonna stay there to
fight the terrorists but also to get
Assad out of power and also to fight
Iran so we're gonna stay there and fight
everybody that's what you're saying
you're gonna do do you have any idea how
moronic that sounds - anybody who knows
anything about the region more Tillerson
remarks were the clearest enunciation
yet by a trump administration official
of us plans in Syria they were
especially striking in their open-ended
commitment given the president given
that President Donald Trump campaigned
on a desire to extricate the u.s. from
messy wars in the Muslim world Tillerson
speaking in California at Stanford
University's Hoover Institution said the
Trump administration won't repeat the
error former President Barack Obama made
in withdrawing US troops from Iraq only
to have to send them back later to help
fight the Islamic state terrorist
network look at the [ __ ] framing
there we're not gonna make the same
mistake as Obama of pulling the troops
out they're not saying oh we're not
gonna make the same mistake as Bush of
going in there what that's what you
should be saying we're not gonna make
bama's mistake was taking people out no
it wasn't no it wasn't it was Bush's
mistake for sending anybody in in the
first place now you could say hey we'll
wire you know if while we're there what
are we supposed to do now now that were
there get the [ __ ] out
and guess what let's say you pull out of
everywhere in the Middle East and
everything goes to [ __ ] so so you want
help people help people send some
humanitarian aid to people who are not
jihadists I'm fine with that I'm sure
you're fine with that
if the choices are send people
humanitarian aid or [ __ ] stay there
indefinitely militarily and occupy them
wasting trillions of dollars and our
lives and the lives of civilians on the
other side which one is a better choice
but no they act like we have no choice
Obama's mistake was pulling out we have
no choice we have to be there forever
stop trying to pretend like we have no
choice we obviously have a choice we
clearly have a choice I just told you we
wasted seven trillion in Iraq which the
two trillion in Afghanistan we're
bombing eight different countries right
now drone strikes increased 432 percent
under Donald Trump the military budget
is what over seven hundred billion
dollars did you know we could fund free
college in the United States not with
the military budget with just the
increase in the military budget from
this year there was a 100 billion dollar
increase in military spending this year
Bernie Sanders free college bill cost
about 80 billion dollars so when they
tell you they always tell you this oh we
can't afford free college Medicare we
can't afford or can't afford a can't
afford can't afford our own we can't
afford it but endless war they don't
even [ __ ] blink
yeah sure blank [ __ ] check I don't
care that it's not helping anything I
don't care that these are illegal wars
of aggression I don't care that the
American people don't want this at all
in a [ __ ] democracy
I don't care well then stop pretending
like you're a representative government
you're not you're not a constitutional
republic you're not a representative
democracy you're not you're a goddamn
oligarchy and plutocracy you're
representing the rich you're
representing the corporation's you're
representing the military-industrial
complex a lot of people are making a lot
of money from these endless wars but
also a lot of innocent people are dying
where the [ __ ] are you media where are
you I know you're too busy still talking
about the [ __ ] country's remark so
you're too busy
doing fake resistance to do actual
resistance on policy issues you what is
it gonna take what is he gonna take
we're already permanently in Iraq we're
permanently in Afghanistan for those you
who don't know we have nine hundred
military bases all around the world that
costs a hundred billion dollars a year
to maintain what are we are we just
gonna endlessly throw money at this [ __ ]
while we have 45,000 people that die
here at home cuz they don't have access
to basic health care tens of millions of
people who have no health insurance
whatsoever we're just gonna sit around
and let this happen
half the country makes thirty thousand
dollars a year or less we're just gonna
pay all that's fine
don't care don't care wages have been
stagnant since the 1980s the minimum
wage is not a living wage so we have
millions of working poor people I don't
care about any of that just keep
throwing tax money overseas killing
innocent people creating more terrorists
all of this is illegal under
international law what we're talking
about here as a terrorist government the
United States imagine imagine if the
facts of this were reversed and it was
Iran bombing eight different countries
invading them illegally and permanently
occupying them what would we say imagine
it was [ __ ] North Korea all we saw in
to North Korea oh my god threat North
Korea the North Korean threat North
Korean threat North Korean threat is
North Korea bombing eight different
countries invading and occupying three
of them indefinitely is that what
they're doing do they have nine hundred
military bases around the world at a
cost of one hundred billion dollars a
year that's us we're doing that and you
don't get a goddamn peep from the
so-called left-wing party not a word not
a word from them
[Music]
and don't and then god damnit if any if
I hear anybody try to browbeat somebody
on the left word you voting for
Democrats I don't want to hear it I
don't want to hear it all the energy
that you've spent berating the left how
about you take that energy and berate
the corporate Democrats for going right
along with Donald Trump right along with
them not even a question it's not a
question yes your policy were with you
we want you to be able to spy on
everybody NSA spying we just voted to
give you warrantless spying power ten
Democrats did that about the same number
of Democrats voted to deregulate Wall
Street so you vote with them on Wall
Street you vote them on NSA spying you
vote with them on foreign policy and
then you're like gosh I can't a white
count are we winning
I've wonder [ __ ] why I wonder why
because with you your slimy little
weasels who try to pretend like you're
on the side of the people and then you
don't vote with the people at least in
recent times Trump's out there like yeah
I'm a [ __ ] [ __ ] sure I've had
enough of this man I've had enough of
this an immediate [ __ ] sound asleep
sound asleep nothing to say about this
nothing to say about the NSA spying
either the Democrats sound asleep
because they're there right along with
them we're not having we're having a
fake debate in the country this is all
Kabuki theater the Democrats will what
course language Donald Trump uses and
Donald Trump will get out there and say
yeah I'm his [ __ ] whole country's Naha
and then all day long the [ __ ] media
Oh
language language rhetoric let's talk
about the surface level semantics
literally [ __ ] I don't care about
some I care about policies and on
policies
you guys are continuing this rotten
disgusting Empire and we can't sit back
and let that happen anymore
the US has backed the rebels in Syria
the rebels are unquestionably aligned
with gee
they are jihadis many of them in fact
there was a study that found over 60% of
the rebels are jihadists 60% there's
been stories of us weapons given to
rebels those rebels immediately hand him
over to al-qaeda there's been stories of
literally us-backed rebels beheading
children there's also been stories of
Pentagon backed fighters in Syria
fighting CIA backed fighters so we're
arming both sides in a conflict even
along with supporting unsavory extremist
characters so understand that this has
nothing to do with protecting you
nothing at all what this has to do with
is us power us domination hegemony
that's what this has to do with it has
to do with the United States maintaining
control of what's viewed as a vital
region of the world and we look at the
world as a global chessboard and we want
to dominate that we want to keep Russia
in check we want to have our allies
dominate the Middle East we've aligned
with Saudi and Israel and we want to
have total control the region for
natural resources purposes so just
understand what this is about
they're gonna pretend like it's about
protecting you from terrorists if they
were so concerned about protecting you
from terrorists why did they armed them
in Syria if they're so concerned about
protecting you from terrorists why did
they give Saudi Arabia over a hundred
billion dollar weapons deal recently
Saudi Arabia is the home of Salafism
Wahhabism the extremist ideology that
the terrorists have they've been in fact
Saudi Arabia has been arming terrorists
jihadis
on the ground in Yemen they've also been
bombing women and children in Yemen so
we're aligned with them as they as the
government tells you no we we need to
keep doing all these wars and illegal
occupations because we're fighting them
it's the saddest most disgusting thing
I've ever seen and again anybody who's
well read on this stuff knows
immediately that the points the
government is making are total [ __ ]
so it's time to rise up and fight back
against it and not allow the government
to do this anymore
because we can't take it anymore
we don't have the money to do all this
[ __ ] around the world we got to stop
massacring innocent civilians we have to
stop backing terrorists if we just
stopped arming everybody in the Middle
East and elsewhere terrorism in the
world would be cut in half in a year we
give the arms to everybody who ends up
fighting how about we don't do that
that was Jill Stein's idea people love
to [ __ ] on Jill Stein but Jill Stein had
a brilliant idea when it was like you
know they're trying to figure out Oh
what do we do to be terrorism huh how
are we gonna be terrorism everybody I
know we're gonna get involved in this
war in that war and this war and Jill's
like no here's an idea how about you
stop arming everybody if you stop arming
everybody they're gonna not gonna have
the weapons to fight if they don't have
the weapons to fight you get a lot more
peace around the world now don't you so
just know that the government's lying to
you they're lying to you what they say
their purposes are that's not their
purposes they're not looking out for you
in fact what they're doing is robbing
you taking the funds and dominating the
world while backing terrorists
so last week the House of
Representatives voted to give Donald
Trump unprecedented warrantless spying
powers it wasn't a close vote it was a
devastating vote 55 Democrats crossed
the aisle and voted with the Republicans
in order to allow Trump to use the NSA
to get all of your information your
metadata and now this came up in the
Senate so how did that go now actually
let me give you a few more specifics
about it this vote in the Senate is
whether or not to shut down debate and
proceed to the actual vote on it so in
other words they're voting whether or
not they want to tweak the legislation
as it is whether or not they want to add
an amendment that you know might add
some protections for everybody from the
guy who Democrats claim is [ __ ]
Hitler and Mussolini and every
authoritarian strong men in the world
rolled into one you would think that
they wouldn't want to give that guy
spying powers they say he's Putin's
puppet so if he's Putin's puppet why
would you want a guy who's a Manchurian
Candidate who's doing treason who's
representing a hostile foreign actor to
be able to spy on all Americans so
naturally the Democrats are gonna vote
to amend it they're not gonna vote to
close the debate right wrong so it
passed 62-38
that was the vote 62-38 and as the
intercept says here it wasn't just
Republicans Democrats also voted to shut
down debate on Trump administration's
surveillance powers now
it's even sadder than that so it was
most Republicans who voted with Trump
and with endless warrantless indefinite
spying but there were some Republicans
who said now I don't I don't want to
have the government with these powers
with these authorities it doesn't it
doesn't seem right
so it was Mike Lee of Utah Ted Cruz Ted
Cruz actually voted on the right side of
this Rand Paul and a handful of other
Republicans again the overwhelming
majority of Republicans were like
warrantless spying is awesome let's give
it to this you know tangerine cheeto
bloated megalomaniac sure he'll he can
wield that power I always [ __ ] up is it
wheeled or yield that power whatever it
is he'll use that power in a smart way
but you ready for this here the
Democrats who voted the wrong way take a
look Tom Carper Bob Casey Catherine
Cortes Masto Joe Donnelly Tammy
Duckworth Dianne Feinstein Maggie Hassan
Heidi Heitkamp Doug Jones Doug Jones
angus King who's an independent Amy
Klobuchar Joe fricking mansion Claire
McCaskill Bill Nelson Gary Peters Jack
Reed jeanne Shaheen Mark Warner Sheldon
Whitehouse the resistance is full of
[ __ ] and what's amazing is many of the
people who are voting to give Trump
endless warrantless spying ability are
the same people who are the loudest in
saying he's Putin's puppet he's
committed treason against this country
so think about that think about that by
their own logic
maybe they're Putin's Stooges maybe
they're doing the Kremlin's bidding or
else why would you vote to give a guy
who you say is representing a hostile
foreign power the ability to spy on all
Americans so it just shows you and it
proves the point it really does that
it's the people who are the biggest
failures on policy are the ones who will
shriek
about the Russia thing they're also the
ones who will shriek the loudest about
all the surface disagreements
although oh my god he said [ __ ]
countries can you believe it let me rant
for 45 minutes about how this is this is
not okay sir this is unbecoming a
president your decorum is not right
you should be more polite the people who
will talk endlessly about how brash
Trump is and how he's breached decorum
and he's not polite the people who will
focus on the style of Trump and the
Russia scandal are the people who agree
with him a hell of a lot more on policy
when they would like you to know because
it's so easy to do that faux resistance
it's so easy to fake you out by
posturing to sound like you're anti
Trump and then you're like ya know let's
let's give them the warrantless spying
power let's vote for and many of these
people did let's vote for many of
Trump's picks for his cabinet why not so
this is the mick resistance through and
through these are the corporate
democrats joe Manchin now remember guys
you can do something about it this isn't
one of those instances where I tell you
what happened and we all go [ __ ] shits
really [ __ ] up son anyway let's move
on to the next story no we can we can
look at this and go shit's really [ __ ]
up but there's an answer the answer is
in the case of Joe Manchin Paula Jean
Swearengen he has a primary opponent a
primary opponent who's gonna fight for
Medicare for all in free college and a
living wage and to legalize marijuana so
you have an amazing candidate fights for
a new New Deal and the wars she's superb
and she's running against the worst
corporatist and in his mind he thinks
well I need to be more like Trump in
order to get reelected no no Trump ran
on a fake populist campaign that's one
of the reasons why he won the people of
West Virginia genuinely want populism so
they want economic populism they
a new new deal they want
medicare-for-all now you might say Kyle
yeah that's you projecting onto them
that's not true we've seen how many
times have we discussed the town hall
where bernie sanders is with chris hayes
in a room full of trump voters and they
gave us standing ovations and kept
clapping for medicare for all and a
living wage so given the option of a
populist democrat they're gonna pick the
populist democrat not the corporate
sellout and not the you know on neptune
republican whose head is up his own ass
what i think one of the Republican
candidate in West Virginia owns a coal
mine where like twenty nine people died
because he skirted regulations are you
[ __ ] ki what who's gonna vote for
that guy you have to have to have to
vote for Paula Deen Swearengen in the
case of Dianne Feinstein there's an
answer Dianne Feinstein is solidly
right-wing she's Republican light there
was a video that resurfaced of her this
week from in the past where she sounded
like Trump on on the issue of
immigration some of the illegal aliens
coming in this country so it's not it's
her voting record to forget the rhetoric
put the rhetoric aside how many times
have you spoken about it she voted for
the Bush tax cuts she supported
virtually every outsourcing deal so this
is a person who's for Wall Street
deregulation this is a person who is not
left-wing at all she loves the NSA and
and you know all the intelligence
agencies which act in a which breached
the Constitution all the time and act in
an authoritarian way on a regular basis
so we have an answer
Allison Hartson is the answer in
California
so just remember man we don't have to
just sit sit back and take it there is a
response and the response is on us it's
on us to get out there and do the hard
work and
lift up these candidates who by the way
take no corporate PAC money so it's
harder for them to get the official
recognition and even with that by the
way
Alison Hartson outraised
every other candidate in the race
including Dianne Feinstein in November
so it can be done we just have to keep
keep the pressure on so let's move
forward and let's fight cuz we I can't
take this [ __ ] anymore
I mean how maddening is this they act
like he's the next Hitler and then they
vote to give him a you know warrantless
spying Authority forever they they don't
care about the Constitution by the way
even if this was under Obama and they
said hey let's vote to give Obama the
the endless ability to violate the
Constitution in the Fourth Amendment and
to spy on everybody and collect
everybody's metadata it would still be
wrong because it's not about the
individual that's an office it's about
the principle of the thing this is a
violation of the Constitution you know
you have no protection from unreasonable
search and seizure anymore you have no
right to privacy why would you and it's
not like they haven't you know use this
Authority in a negative way they already
have this is what we learned from the
Snowden leaks for example one of the
things we learned is people at the NSA
would spy on their exes they called it
love int it was short for love
intelligence it was an open thing where
they'd be like yeah I'm gonna just gonna
go look at what my ex is doing they say
that many people in the intelligence
agencies they are the ones who have the
tape over their webcam on their computer
what this is this used to be considered
like just wacky out-there conspiracy
theory [ __ ] no it's not
they built a multi-billion dollar
facility in Utah to store all of your
metadata this is how they smear you so
what happens if you rise up and you want
to fight for the people look what I have
an Eliot Spitzer not saying he's great
he's a hypocrite in many respects he
cracked down on legal prostitution on
prostitution as he was going to
prostitutes giant hypocrite
but he will also crack down on Wall
Street so what did they do
Wow look at that all the dirty details
about your private life get leaked out
there how I don't know we happened to
stumble across it come on this is how
they get you
this is exactly what they did to Martin
Luther King they rubbed in his face all
of his affairs and they they sent the
letter saying hey what you should kill
yourself you're not a man of honor
you're not a man of integrity look at
what you're doing in your personal life
you're holding up pretending pretending
you're this this moral authority and
look at you look at all the dirty things
you're doing sexually this is what our
intelligence agencies try to do they try
to get Martin Luther King jr. to commit
suicide you're gonna trust this
government whether it's the NSA the FBI
the CIA we're talking about the CIA
history of overthrowing governments so
that we can put our own puppet dictators
in there who will serve our corporations
this unscrupulous authoritarian
government you're gonna trust them with
everybody's metadata and ten Democrats
they're supposed to be the resistance
they're supposed to be the left the
Democrats just said yeah I don't it's
fine take all of our information let
Donald Trump have this in front on 'old
Trump oh god it's so embarrassingly
pathetic they don't represent you they
don't care about what you want they
don't care about the constitution they
don't care about civil liberties or
human rights they don't care and all it
took was a fake example or two of what
we use as a program to get the
terrorists or something so please now
you have to allow us to continue to spy
on everybody you want to spy on somebody
get a [ __ ] warrant that's the way the
system works that's why it's supposed to
work get a warrant and then go spy on a
particular individual looking for a
specific thing no they don't have to do
that if you're having a email
conversation with a loved one of yours
who happens to live in oh I don't know
London they Jay collect all of their
[ __ ] all of their correspondence
unbelievable man unbelievable
these Democrats there's not a strong
enough word to describe how loathsome
and rotten and [ __ ] as they are get
rid of them throw the bums out and throw
all the Republicans out to it like I
told you the the overwhelming majority
of Republicans were in favor that's
overwhelming majority so I'm not letting
them off the hook based on being hard on
the Democrats here all I'm saying is the
Democrats are supposed to be the
hashtag-- resistance but when it comes
to policy how many times have I said
this they agree a lot more with Trump
than they would like you to know some of
them are actively helping right now hey
we need let's deregulate Wall Street
again you want to do regulate Wall
Street again hey let's do that hey let's
vote for Trump's cabinet picture we do
that yeah I think we should do that hey
you want to let this guy continue to go
to endless war and idly sit here want to
let him increase drone strikes and just
sit here they're all there in favor all
that stuff which is why when they're
talking against Trump Atal I can't
believe his language he said [ __ ] whole
countries I can't believe this guy
that's so that's so not polite god clean
up your language sir you want to resist
[ __ ] resist resist on policy but no
you can't do that because you're you are
without a doubt little puppets of the
establishment they're making you dance
for them and they're sitting back and
watching it and enjoying it because they
know you're by no stretch of the
imagination principled and you by no
stretch of the imagination want to fight
for the American people
we're back [ __ ] so you pretend to
pick where we were talking I don't even
remember we're something about
psychologists and dick size and all that
I don't know but you remember Good Will
Hunting where it was like the best
[ __ ] person great movie but then
Damon like ripped his butt apart and
[ __ ] exposed him for being all [ __ ]
up that's such a good movie I think I
want to go back and watch that movie my
favorite movies yeah I think that was
one of my favorite movies too yeah I was
just watching Magic Mike before we came
on air Magic Mike that's that were there
strippers right yeah Matthew
McConaughey's in it
Channing Tatum Olivia Munn's in it I
never watched that movie is it good I
watched like the last half an hour and
it seemed like just like a coin I mean
it seemed okay it seemed okay but it's
definitely like a chick flick like
McConaughey was in a g-string falling
like dancing on stage all oiled up you
know that's pretty funny you know what I
uh I watched this week i watch The
Godfather I hadn't Sun up I've never
seen The Godfather I saw when I was like
15 or some [ __ ] and I just didn't
remember any of it
it's really good right it was pretty
good yeah it was pretty good it
definitely stands the test of time um I
guess I was just a mob boss yes I gotta
watch a godfather to now and Godfather
three but it was good it was good I mean
it was definitely like you get the sense
it was like an old-school II movie yeah
but it was definitely worth watching for
sure and I'm curious what Al Pacino's
great in it and so is Marlon Brando this
is like the usual suspects of Italian
dudes in there right is Joe Pesci in it
Joe Pesci is not in The Godfather know
but he's in Goodfellas he's okay and
that was a that was a good movie too
he's also in casino all right isn't he
in casino yes I think he's in casino too
I feel like I feel like they all made
their rounds in those movies like just
all those like DeNiro Pesci and they're
all pretty good on Brando you know what
I finished I finished Boardwalk Empire
too recently he told me I got a I think
I'll look into that one listen that it
started out for me it takes me a while
before I really get into a show mm-hmm
but for me it was at the end of season
three I was like god damn that's that
this is good for a Boardwalk Empire is
there like killings like what makes it
good like killings that are like just
like deceiving people and she like that
yeah he's a gangster he was he was a
politician and it's semi based on a true
story the guy's name was Nucky Johnson
in real life in might be in the show
he's Nucky Thompson and he was a guy who
was the treasurer in Atlantic City and
he was a politician and he was very
well-connected but also during
Prohibition he was bringing the alcohol
in and he was getting super rich and he
was a [ __ ] mafia boss basically oh
and then you have like you know them
versus and so you're gonna meet the the
guy who's the the black mob leader the
Nucky Thompson who's I guess Irish and
then there's Arnold Rothstein is in it
who's the Jewish mob leader and then you
have the Italians Missouri is him and
it's just it's it's just a good show
it's just all the [ __ ] that happens and
how he loses power and comes back to
power and what ends up happening and
yada yada yada yada yada so I just
recommend watching it but it's up there
now like I put it up there with [ __ ]
breaking Breaking Bad and I put it up
there with Sopranos it's up there man it
was good it was really good
yeah my sister watch and said she liked
it a lot she would always have to like
catch the episodes when they were on I
think I'm gonna have to look into that
one so I'm thinking next maybe black
mirror I'll do cuz black mayor
everybody's [ __ ] themselves over it
but the thing with black mirror is you
don't have to watch from season one to
like where it's up to you just pick no
every episode is different you could go
to season like season 4 episode 1 was
good
season 3 episode 1 was good like you
could so I just look at all the titles
to show house that was kind of like that
oh it's all separate kind of it's like
each show has its own medical thing
which is separate but the plot does kind
of go from episode 1 all the way through
but you're saying this like The Twilight
Zone then there were it's all each one
is an individual thing yeah I don't know
I don't know what the toy with the
Twilight Zone was all different [ __ ] all
different [ __ ] different
characters in each yeah that's different
exactly how black mirror is yellow and
it's dope cuz I literally just looked on
Netflix and like an episode title look
intriguing I was like I'm gonna choose
that one and it's just you could pick
whatever the [ __ ] you want so it's not
if you like you have to get invested in
that series like you could watch some
other [ __ ] and then just in between like
pick a black mirror episode and watch
well I'll tell you right now what
remains on the list it's still most of
the list is there which is annoying
because I didn't even put a dent in it
so since I started my my goal to watch
the good shows I've done Breaking Bad
The Sopranos better call Saul but that's
still on obviously the wire which was
great Deadwood narcos Prison Break these
are all you watched these are all the
ones I watched and Boardwalk Empire the
ones I haven't watched buckle up the
Americans Game of Thrones Mad Men
damages the shield 24 homeland billions
goliath ray Donovan lost Oz West Wing
house of cards the man in the high
castle Dexter Spartacus mr. robot Rome
black mirror orphan black Sons of
Anarchy Medici in treatment fan of
brothers Twin Peaks and Madea does yeah
Madea does whatever yeah so I still got
a lot more I don't know I feel like you
should not go off lost because I heard
the ending was whack to that [ __ ] and it
was like 4700 episodes
oh it was a lot of episodes I heard it
was like it's like the bajillion seasons
and also like that - and that should
supposed to be really hot which one Mad
Men is a zillion episodes oh really
yeah and it's like I want to see it
because it's hot but it's so many
episodes and it's like like Boardwalk
Empire wasn't there's five seasons and
it was like yeah that's not that bad ten
per season or maybe eight per season or
whatever the [ __ ] it was um you should
throw on and I'm I haven't watched it
but I heard it was good sons of anarchy
that's on the list yeah Oh was it on
there yeah I heard that was a good one
but then you can also take off house of
cards too because that [ __ ] did it oh
yeah I am gonna take that one off
because it doesn't have an ending yeah
and also because since I'm a I'm a
political junkie I'm always it's almost
like so the same thing happened with
so I like golf and when I would watch a
golf movie there's only like two golf
movies that are even watchable because
when they [ __ ] up little things it's
like with you remember in rounders where
the way they bet like I call and I raise
X amount and you're like no I guess not
a bloater play exactly you got to do it
got a raise all at once you can't
[ __ ] do that so it's like the same
[ __ ] like when I watch a golf thing it's
like the guy's got a swing that looks
terrible but he supposed to be the best
one of the best pros in the world it's
like don't [ __ ] like get a guy who
knows how to swing the club yeah so it's
just annoying and the same [ __ ] happens
with what was I talking about house of
cards and politics of cars and politics
ain't politics like Wesley would have I
see a West Wing because I'd be like no I
know how this [ __ ] works and you're not
no this is good you do have to make it
like extreme like how could they even
like with Boardwalk Empire where he was
a politician but he was also a [ __ ]
gangster yeah so I was like oh why cuz
he's a gangster I got it like now that's
the new angle I feel like a parody would
almost work too if it was like a joke on
pot like yeah like I'm like your bio it
was Billy Madison yeah yeah yeah of
course cuz like he was a golfer but like
what you're talking dad works too
yeah for sure yeah I've been watching um
on HBO there's a show crashing with Pete
Davidson I think isn't it no Pete Pete
Holmes Pete Holmes Pete Davidson's the
guy from SNL um he's like a religious
comedian dude who's like sort of
figuring out the like comedy scene and
the season 2 episode 1 he meets a Penn
Jillette you know I'm right again mm-hmm
Penn is like an atheist so I think in
real life too and he like he talks to
him about like religion and sort of just
has him second-guessing all his [ __ ] and
he goes out and gets like real drunk and
like has sex with this girl but I know
it's a good show I have a I have a
picture with Penn Jillette I met Penn
Jillette I'm like fascinated by them I
really like like yeah yeah they're
they're cool they're hardcore
libertarians but I like them they're
good guys that's not like a bad thing
right doesn't that mean they're like no
means they're half right in my opinion
half right half wrong but he had their
cool day they do a good show I saw their
show in Vegas uh-huh it's great show
I also saw Louie Anderson in Vegas that
was good Louie Anderson he was like a
thousand pounds I'm going back to 2010
or 2011 that I saw him he was like a
thousand pounds back then was he funny
funny as hell really he was yeah he was
funny was it like super dirty and
raunchy dirty little dirty he's good it
was funny hilarious that's funny
they're coming back with Roseanne I saw
that but she's gonna be a trump
supporter and it that's what I heard
supposedly oh she's a trump supporter
there's your show she's gonna be Trump
supporter that's like what their chart
that's like the thing they're trying to
do that's part of it like back when it
was the original Roseanne she was like a
working-class kind of person he was like
racist and like she's a little she's a
little iffy but you know I hope that
show doesn't do well she was number one
by a mile when her show was out like it
was crazy
good I don't know I never watched it but
she was like ridiculously big like
ridiculous like you have when you have a
conversation it's like Seinfeld or
Roseanne like those are that she's in
that you know in that I feel like she
was in that in the early 90s but then
like towards the end she started getting
smoked but they went out number one like
Seinfeld but I could be wrong
oh no you might yeah you might be right
maybe they did like and on their own
note yeah she she follows me on Twitter
Roseanne yeah really yeah I'm kind of
flattered by that okay so maybe I hope
to show des okay I watched actually
young Sheldon on CBS oh it's like it
don't this [ __ ] don't it was it was just
one episode so I don't have a big enough
sample size on that [ __ ] that supposed
to be the spin-off of the Big Bang well
yeah he's like he's the Sheldon like
he's the guy from Big Bang and he does
like voice talking throughout it
it's like The Cleveland Show like who
the [ __ ] watched the Clio no Cleveland
show is trash
but young Sheldon was okay there was
like a NASA scientist that came to his
high school classroom and he was like
explaining how it's very expensive every
time a spaceship goes up because when it
lands it just lands in the ocean and
then Sheldon raised his hand it was like
well why don't why doesn't it land like
on land and they would you would save
like losing the thing and the guy said
well it's very complicated and it's
something I can't explain he was like no
I can explain it for you right now and
he like goes up to the board and does
this whole diagram [ __ ] and all episode
he's like trying to get in touch with
NASA and would it like I don't know I
always I was entertained by it it's at
30 minutes or an hour 30 minutes right
thirty minutes yes they come that thing
is gonna get amazing ratings and it's
gonna be super high up there yeah the
Big Bang Theory super high up there
that's a big bank there he's been there
forever I don't like my uncle watches
that mine if you could turn to CBS and
they'll always say like watch Dave and
Dick it's the number one rated and I'm
like how is all this [ __ ] number one
rated cuz there's a lot of boring white
parents out there yeah
America is packed full of boring white
parents that's what they do
they'll come home I can't they may sit
there and a night of watching that [ __ ]
they've just been trying to find the
next friends since friends went off the
air
I think Big Bang Theory is almost like
dude that's it's on CBS it's on Fox it's
on like TNT and yes it's on all those
stations oh my god I think it is like a
hole that [ __ ] that's not on some Fred
[ __ ] then cuz friends is everywhere you
know there's not a time of day that law
and order is not on TV
it isn't notice on TV yeah they must be
making so much money I went through
phases with Law & Order there was a time
when I would watch it all the time and
then after like a year I was like I'm
good I don't need to watch this anymore
yeah but you can always watch it like
it's always there you put it on it is
always exactly it's always there like
watching episode alone order my wife was
saying there was an episode where a guy
put a camera in Starbucks toilets cuz he
got off on like seeing people pee and
like and [ __ ] oh my god yeah imagine
seeing somebody [ __ ] from that angle
where you see like the [ __ ] ass open
yeah yeah it's weird
oh one auto writers got to be pretty
like I mean they're creative but they
got to think of some [ __ ] up [ __ ] they
probably just go to like the police
blogger of like New York City and just
see what the hell happens okay are they
all based on true stories are just some
of them I don't know I know that I feel
like they're always in the beginning you
would see this like based on a true
story or something like that yeah I
think most of them are like loosely
based on a probably like portable yeah
Boardwalk Empire where it's like loosely
based on it is a story maybe they do
that
yeah the liberties with it but that was
the thing that was really cool about
boardwalk Empire's that like they said
usually in in these in shows that are
similar to it they will have it mostly
fictional but they'll sprinkle in some
real characters mm-hmm but with
Boardwalk Empire they did their reverse
where they followed the character who
they based on a real character and a lot
of it is real and then they sprinkled
into fictional stuff I could see that
yeah they made it interesting because
you're going oh it's like 50/50 is this
one of the things that really happened
or is this one thanks yeah usually this
[ __ ] that was like over-the-top extreme
OD it would be like the Hollywood Chum
shaman dramatization
don't drop ization droplet is easy oh
you know what we didn't do for a pole
that we should have done [ __ ] look I
mean we got to do Tupac verse biggie so
that's another one yeah you got to do
that you got to do Britney Spears verse
Christina Aguilera yeah you got it did
you throw Jessica Simpson in that pole
to like would Madonna be in that pole
would she be the New Kids on the Block
on that [ __ ] mmm you know yeah
you do kind of have to add her look down
a Britney or Christina did you all Lady
Gaga Lady Gaga to new right for that
poll that's like a nice big time that's
like going in sync Backstreet Boys or
Bieber yeah true true true yeah good
point did you watch any of the games
yesterday on TNT
I watched the Cavs Warriors one just
like the end of it and then I woke up to
like the whole melee that happened with
the Clippers rockets did you see all
that [ __ ] I did I was gonna ask you if
you if you heard about that apparently
just childish James Harden Trevor Ariza
and Chris Paul
and Chris Paul no they went to oh and
Chris Paul who who were they trying to
[ __ ] up Blake Griffin Blake Griffin and
Austin Rivers and what why I didn't see
the well just they were just beef in
because well I mean it just goes back to
when Chris Paul played with the Clippers
and everybody thought they got along but
I don't think Chris Paul and Blake
Griffin really got along and then Trevor
Ariza during the game was talking [ __ ]
to Austin Rivers who was on the bench
and shree close so they start a beef in
and I mean they probably are mad at like
Austin Rivers because his dad is the
coach and the GM gave Mike a 40 million
dollar contract granted he's a good
player so they were beefing about that
and then like Blake Griffin bumped into
Mike D'Antoni and likes like D'Antoni
started screaming at Blake Griffin so
everybody was [ __ ] screaming at
everybody oh [ __ ] and then after the
game they asked Blake Griffin like would
you say to a reason and he was like he
asked me if he was coming a birthday
party yeah Blake Griffin seems kind of
like a douche though like I don't think
I like him he seems like a douche but he
seems like he's he's a little witty he
seems funny on Sasha it was like a
creationist like he thinks the world is
6,000 years old really I thought I read
a long time ago oh I just listened to a
podcast with Kyrie Irving and JJ reddick
he's a flat earther Kyrie Irving yeah he
but like he was like I wasn't saying the
earth is flat I was more so just saying
question thing like don't question that
yeah
exactly you're not the question that
that's done that one settled you know
what to bring that one up and then JJ
reddick was like I have my own
conspiracy that arm that I know is not
true but I might think it's true um that
dinosaurs never actually exists oh come
on man they're just [ __ ] with people
at this point are they just trolling
they could just be [ __ ] with people I
don't know because then he was like you
know I went to I go to these like I went
to the Natural History Museum or
something like that and even do to work
there was like yeah all the dinosaurs we
have or only like we only ever found
like the most 80% of a dinosaur or
something like that it's all that
genetically computer ease those are
creationist talking points there that's
what they do they try to say is you like
that yeah there's the dinosaurs that's
what they try to argue even though
doctors died out 65 million years ago
yeah but there's like there's dinosaur
fossils like there's actual proof that
and never being true I don't think the
80% oh you only found 80% oh really and
even if that was that's not like a lot
of sound 80% of a dinosaur yeah like
they existed yeah if you found 80% of a
human being you'd be like okay they were
human beings yeah you wouldn't say
humans don't exist I only found 80% of
one [ __ ] yeah they're I mean Kelly they
were laughing man did you see Shaq and
Charles Ross you were laughing their ass
off at like oh you're gonna fight them
is out you're gonna do like you went
slow and make it forty million dollars a
year they were laughing cuz I think yeah
the police was called yes the police
revolved there was a police presence
like [ __ ] police presence like we do
officer Chris Paul is gonna hurt me yeah
they did a police blogger
what it do people yo I got my phone next
to the computer I should probably move
it to ya Afghanistan you heard the
little like from it or no no I just
heard a doodoo oh I heard this is from
it but I just moved my phone and it
stopped oh really
so yeah this time usually I have some
topics for the podcast that I keep in
the notes on my phone
mmm but I printed it out on a sheet of
paper just so that I could keep the
phone far enough away or won't [ __ ] our
[ __ ] up
that's what Molly did so she started
like her own like she's doing like a she
makes a couple YouTube videos or
whatever for pregnancy [ __ ] oh nice yeah
and she had me come on one of them and
she had like printed out questions and I
was like you printed out questions just
so everybody knows Koren has done zero
prep for any of the podcast IO but for
me the only prep I do for the podcast is
if I think of something during the week
I'll just put it in my notes that's what
I've been doing through though like
recently but I also have a bad memory so
like if it happens to me on like
Wednesday or Tuesday after the show I'm
like oh maybe I'll talk about that [ __ ]
next week and I'm like I don't remember
what the [ __ ] one that happens to me
too man you have to like the second you
think of it like there were times where
I was falling asleep and a something
came to me for the podcast and I
literally like rolled over grabbed my
phone put it in my notes because if you
don't put it in right away
you're gonna you're gonna [ __ ] it up you
know what I do that for when I would
have like a job interview or something
like that and I like something I feel
like I would want to talk about any
interview I would always write it down
just because I'm like and I think of the
[ __ ] when I'm in the shower I always
want me in the shower I have the best
ideas yeah that happens to me too
sometimes in the shower I'll think of
something what do you think that is like
just you're feeling good warm what
ladies you're not like you're letting
the ideas come to you you're not like
chasing them down yeah yeah I feel like
I've heard a lot of people say that a
lot of comedians too I think
say like that they think of their ideas
in the shower yeah I believe that
so before we got this we fired up the
podcast you mentioned the the David
Letterman Obama interview yeah I enjoyed
it a lot yeah I always have a lot of
different feelings when I see
when I see like Obama and stuff with the
first thought is obviously well it's
better it would be better if he was in
power compared to trump that's a given
so like I think like damn it wasn't that
long ago that we had somebody who was
not as shitty in all this human being
yeah but then the other side of me is
always like like Letterman really was
sucking him off yeah he was going and
was the only president I've like
respected or something he said something
like that right at the end yeah his his
final thing like that's sort of like
just outside of like I mean I mean you
know obviously the policy politics [ __ ]
a lot better than I do and just like
obviously Obama has done bad [ __ ] and
sent people off to war and killed
whatever you know drone strikes and all
that stuff but like just on some like
like human being like looking at Dave
Letterman when he he said like two
things back-to-back that like why wasn't
I in Selma when that March happened and
he was like Letterman said like because
Obama said you know aren't you lucky to
be in your position or something like
that and he was like it you know I am
because you know when when who's the guy
that walked across the bridge that they
were talking about John Lewis they were
talking to you John Lewis he was like so
when John was walking across the bridge
I was driving down to Florida with my
friends to get drunk in Bahamas Wow and
he said so I am lucky and then I don't
know where that point was going but like
it just it just was like a genuine
moment they were David Letterman was
like I really respect you just as a
human being and like politics aside
which is hard from two people to do
because it obviously Obama was president
he just seems like a genuinely good like
dad like human being doesn't seem like
he's cheating on his wife right thing
really loves his daughters so for me I
was like wow Letterman really respects
him on that level yeah you know it's
when you look at the intangible [ __ ]
that doesn't like matter much ultimately
like the how he is as a human being and
how he talks and how he you know there's
the rat he's peaceful yeah like all that
[ __ ] nobody can deny that he's like he's
an adult like he's a mature person
whoo you know you'd go oh I it's better
than that guys in charge than a guy like
Trump by like a million miles but that
was a little annoyed at the like
knocking him off because you I mean
you're not gonna get it from David
Letterman because he was a he was a
talk-show host he was a you know
nighttime talk shows it's like he's not
gonna do the grilling him on like how
about all those drone strikes he killed
innocent people do you ever think of
that or like you know the stuff that
would be real hard questions that I
would actually be curious to ask Obama
because I don't want a lot of you
I don't think Obama is a bad person but
I think he was like disconnected enough
from a lot of the damage of many of the
decisions he made particularly on
foreign policy that he didn't like he
didn't connect the dots like he didn't
really think like I'm responsible for
this you know what I mean so those are
questions I'd like to see asked but you
know they they're not gonna do that in
that kind of an interview but overall I
like I like I like interviews like that
in general like I like hearing what
these kinds of people have to say and it
was interesting seeing Dave Letterman
after such a long time when he was
because he was one of my I liked him
more than a lot of the late night hosts
yeah I think he had more of that like I
don't give a [ __ ] attitude I'll just I'm
gonna ask it you know like yeah and he
clashed often times with a lot of like
Bill O'Reilly he had on in clash with
him and ball he out on a classroom and
actually with Trump he did something
that's like legendary they don't people
should go watch this whenever they get
the time it's David Letterman had Trump
on and he got him to talk about it cuz
you know how Trump was used to the China
China's terrible China China yeah and so
he got him to like go off on that kind
of a riff and then he was like oh by the
way I have your ties here these are
really nice it was a nice tie he's
holdin up he's like I like the color and
everything and he's like hey do me a
favor hold this flip it over what does
it say on the back and Trump was like
made in China and I was like that's I
like that because it just it's just he
cornered him in such a masterful way
like the way he walked Trump down that
path the Trump was just going right down
that path like yeah China to do it
they're killing us with the trade deals
China China said it's right it's right
for like any celebrity
or someone in power when they're on live
TV or on one of those like talk shows to
get cornered like that you know because
usually their publicist or whatever
that's like don't ask him about this or
they don't want to talk about this or
they're savvy enough to see the trap
being laid from a mile away
when Trump couldn't because Trump's
Trump so he's just like you know like a
rabid animal that's in a cage and he's
like isn't China like - doing some bad
stuff so yeah China said and just went
right down that path which was hilarious
we should probably do the poll questions
right up front because yeah he said
there's a good one oh well we had one
from last week - right em I remember
that cube versus uh chop dice
oh that's right cubes were okay so let's
let's put that one out there right away
because we already know that we're doing
that one and then I got a few more that
I want to and I was thinking of a way of
that I could like you know already have
them lined up in the old Twitter machine
before I got out here's an awful like
type it as we talked but yeah I don't
know how to do that so yeah drafts or
something but I don't know if it was
what could do for a poll or I haven't
even tried I'm not gonna lie to anybody
I had earlier today I had this delicious
veggie wrap it was so [ __ ] good do
you like I don't know you don't like
fried eggplant now it looks too much
like chicken parm and it gets me mad
that's not chicken parm oh I like I had
fried eggplant with peppers olives and
then like some cheese or something was
in there it was [ __ ] delicious
he it sounds banging but I my mom used
to get like when we would order Italian
food for dinner and they would deliver
that [ __ ] she would get like a eggplant
parmesan and I would always be hungry
like the next day cuz she would only eat
like half and I would see it in the
fridge and I'll be like yes there's half
of a chicken parm in there and she baked
it sagg plant and you'd be like that's
pretty funny
okay so this one is going out right now
skis cubed ice versus crushed ice yeah
that's a that's a good pole it's a great
pole simple and I think I know what the
results are gonna be you think it's
gonna be crushed cuz I know I used to be
crushed but now I think I'm cubed
no [ __ ] that is gonna [ __ ] it's gonna
cry cubed is gonna crush all you think
cubed is gonna win 100% 100% what's your
reasoning cuz [ __ ] well I don't know
anybody my dad I think was the only
person in the world who loved crushed I
think I mean they wouldn't give you
crushed on the refrigerator as an option
if people didn't like it that's a decent
point hold on once I actually I'm gonna
do this right on the screen here cuz my
phone is acting up
I like how um that's true that is true
cuz I remember one time this is I'm
gonna sound so stupid everybody
listening here but whatever let's roll
with it I there was like this Camaro
that Chevy made for a while that was
like this dislike neon green Camaro and
I was like that color is [ __ ] hot I
love that color and I was like damn if
other like if other companies made cars
in that color I bet that [ __ ] would sell
like crazy and somebody was like hey
idiot if they would if they DIF that was
the case they would have already been
making him it was like no and they were
like yes they would have made it if that
[ __ ] sold a lot and then I had to rely I
realized like oh that's right they're
only gonna make it if it like sells so
that is to your point like the crushed
ice it's in like every single
refrigerator has that option if it's got
the ice thing in there mm-hmm all the
funky colors for cars are usually on a
Camaro that's a good point
the Camaros do tend to have a lot of
funky colors right out of like all the
coming Mustangs sometimes you see like
it may be like a purple or something
like that but I feel like Camaros are
the only ones where you see like a
bright yellow bright green like a like a
an aqua blue or they had to stripe a lot
of almost the stripes are gone on almost
every other kind of car but they for
like Camaros they threw them in there
yeah I feel like Camaros a big on that
Chargers not so much sometimes you could
see a funky color charger what's the
line between like super douchey and cool
when it comes to sports car because
there is a line you know what I mean
like you know yeah for sure there's a
line like if you get the
if you get a Camaro when you get it in
like like a dark gray like that might be
hot but if you get that bright green
people might be like you're a douche and
a [ __ ] yeah loser yeah I think there
are certain colors that are okay like I
think on the was the first car we
mentioned the Camaro Meryl yeah the
Camaro
I think bright yellow is fine because
that's almost on some like transformer
[ __ ] so it sort of gives you the okay
yeah sports cars yeah like a lot of
sports cars come in yellow so that's a
kind of a regular almost like a rescue
like that's such a bold color I would
never get a yellow everyone old I've
seen some yellow shirts I like though
even though yellow is a bold color but
I've seen some yellow shirts or I was
like I like that it looks kind of good I
would almost argue that wearing yellow
is tougher to wear than pink I mean I
love rocking pink I think pink is like a
really nice color yeah that's true
I don't know I just I'm not a fan of
yellow anything I think yellow would be
my least favorite color I just voted
right now damn that's [ __ ] up I don't
do I even have a least favorite color I
think I like I'm all like I like wearing
shirts of all different oh that's not
true you know what color I don't like
navy blue I'm a fan of navy blue
I'll tell you right now it's having an
identity crisis it's always had an
identity crisis it doesn't know if it's
like if it's like black or like dark
grey yeah it's blue like it's like
flirting with both it's like I want to
be black but no I don't I also kind of
want to be blue and it's like sometimes
you gotta look at it for a while to
figure out exactly what it is like what
shirts are the [ __ ] worst even when
you go to the store when you have to
look to close on a shirt if you don't
know if it's blue or black and then you
even ask the employees like hey what
color is this and they're like hold on
sometimes you can look at the tag and
he'll tell you that I'm like why why
isn't it just blue or black that's the
exact point that's the exact reason why
I've always kind of not like navy blue
and I know [ __ ] I think most people
like navy blue though so it's almost
like [ __ ] up because I depends cuz I
think there's different shades of navy
blue if it's navy blue enough where you
could tell it's navy blue
okay with it if it's like a navy blue
that's comfortable in its navy blueness
and it's obviously navy blue I'm fine
with that it's okay it's still not up
there in me for cut with me for colors
but yeah it's okay but when it's the one
that's really borderline then I don't
then I don't like it okay so wait we got
it we got to keep doing that just like a
1970s that was like a 19th like 80s song
right Donna yeah okay so first polls out
and by the way I think cubed is gonna
win with 70%
I think 70/30 I think we might have an
upset on our hands tonight white yeah
and crushed might you feel like I'm just
gonna pull a trump I think so I think
people I think people will go with
crushed okay the next one and this is a
good one because we got to figure out
exactly what we're gonna put in the poll
but I'll tell you what I first put down
and then we could we get so I wanted to
do milky wavers KitKat versus Reese's
vers Twix that's what I wanted to do now
I'm anticipating that you're about to
hit me with nah son you gotta throw
Snickers in there or you're gonna hit me
with nah you got to put I don't know
some other Three Musketeers or some [ __ ]
and I have [ __ ] Three Musketeers
Snickers has to be in there okay so step
but see here's my reasoning why I left
Snickers out because we only have we can
only put four in there and what are we
doing is it best chocolate bar yeah best
best chocolate bar I guess she's like
her she's got to be in that [ __ ] see
that's the thing I was afraid of because
so the reason why I'd said milky wavers
kick a vers Reese's vers Twix is in my
mind those are like the four that are in
the running in my mind for like the best
but I know good take Milky Way hell
Milky Way's a [ __ ] Milky Way see but
I think that the majority are gonna be
with you on that and they're gonna say
you have to get rid of Milky Way and put
Snickers in there
yeah yeah Milky Way is like if you were
to compare Mario and Luigi right marry
Oh Luigi yeah even though I when I play
[ __ ] Mario Kart I would pick Luigi
over Mario it's irrelevant because Mario
is Mario yeah exactly yes all right I'm
swayed on that we'll get rid of Milky
Way we'll put in Snickers I don't I
think I'm gonna stand firm on KitKat
Reese's and Twix Kit Kat Reese's and tic
twigs kick hit I'm okay with Reese's
yeah I gotta be in there Twix is that
alternative that's sort of swaying it
from me a little bit so you all know
banging you thinking you want to acts
that for Hershey's what about M&Ms that
sort of has to fall in the category so
let's [ __ ] but [ __ ] okay so let's keep
it with best chocolate bar bar but then
Reese's art isn't really a bar yeah
that's true too but it's still it still
has to be on the list cause it's Reese's
[Music]
I'm a big fan of heath bar there's no
way that shit's getting on the list or
hundred grand but there's no way that's
a hundred grand is bangin it's got the
little like nugget things in there mr.
Florez yeah that is a hundred grand
nobody yet nobody eats it nobody has it
nobody now people are like hunter
grinding or just art my I never had one
of those meanwhile like that [ __ ] is
bangin yeah
that is good those little like those
little crispity things it's like a
little rice krispies yeah my mom loves
what the [ __ ] are called it's got like
raisins in it and chunky bar so chunky
bar I don't think I've ever had that
I've never even heard of the chunk you
ever had that my dad used to love almond
joy yeah jelly I've heard of you like
never - I know - which I was like damn
you're the only person that likes good
and plenty on in the world yeah good
yeah don't like good and plenty it was
like licorice II [ __ ] it's like a
Mike and Ike licorice he tastes it was
you it's like old person candy it's like
that's the big family yeah I'm enjoying
like that like that was the purple but
mama joys are pretty good the good news
like this old guy [ __ ] candy good &
plenty was in the purple box
almond joy was in the blue [ __ ] right
that's right yeah yeah
I like gum peanut chews but I think it's
only an East Coast thing because they
don't have it in the Midwest good peanut
chews are pretty good I'm a huge fan of
peanut chews all right so I think I love
Mike and Ikes I think they're delicious
but we're talking about obviously
chocolate here I think so we sneak as
KitKat Reese's Twix I'm comfy with that
yeah that's fine I just feel like we're
we're I mean there's her there's Hershey
Pennsylvania and Hershey Park like her
she's a big one but here okay so here's
my reasoning why it's getting left
behind here cuz it's so plain like it's
just a chocolate bar yeah it got a
zillion things in there true yeah
leave Twix Twix gives it a little okay
yeah what's your favorite on that I'll
tell you mine in a second Twix Kit Kat
Snickers Reese's I'm gonna have to go
I'm gonna go Snickers Twix Kit Kat
Reese's not a fan of the peanut butter
really and I'm some chew and Snickers
cuz it's always there
like it's just a good default to always
have some sometimes not in the mood for
Twix and Snickers I can always have a
Snickers um I'll tell you mine in a
second and then I'll tell you what I
think the audience is gonna say I feel
like you're gonna put so many candy bars
so last week Trump spent some time with
the leader of Norway and after that he
had an immigration meeting with some
senators some Democrats and Republicans
and in that meeting he allegedly said
why do we have so many immigrants from
 countries quote
countries you know why can't we have
more Norwegians come here so originally
he didn't deny saying that the White
House did not deny that he said that but
now in the days since there are some
Republicans who came out and said no I
was in the room and I didn't hear him
say that it's always weasel words to
kind of tap dance around it which leads
me to think of course he said it and
then some are saying I was
misrepresented that's what I'm sure and
every single Democrat in the room dick
Durbin being one of them but there were
others came out and said no he did say
that and it was clear that he said that
it wasn't up in the air we know for sure
so this story in particular the
country's phrase that led to a tsunami
of criticism it's some of the toughest
I've seen the press beyond Donald Trump
now why is that we have to look at the
context and according to the context
that we were given what he's saying is
and he gave specific countries to El
Salvador Haiti and African countries
what he's saying is hey people who come
here from El Salvador and Haiti and
Africa they're not welcome because those
are countries which means that
everyone coming from those countries are
shitty people which of course is the
 definition of bigotry oh you're
gonna your Haitians are gonna come here
people from El Salvador are gonna come
here Africans are gonna come here why do
we have so many people from
 countries coming here so the
point there is these are inherently
shitty people now the implication is all
people who come from these places are
shitty people which again is I don't
know how anybody could argue that's not
bigoted of course that's bigoted
now furthermore immigrants from those
countries ironically are typically way
more educated than immigrants from
predominantly white countries from
Europe for example so you don't have the
right when you press them enough they go
no we just want to get rid of the
illegal immigration all we want is legal
immigration and we want it based on
merit that's what we want it based on we
want people gonna come here and are
gonna work their ass off well guess what
according to your own standard
Republicans your merit-based standard
way more people who come here from
Africa for example are educated they get
a degree so that's in that's an
interesting fact isn't it because it
really unmasks their real position their
real position is they're black and brown
people and I don't really want them in
the country
so even though they are more educated
which means in their mind the mind of
the Republicans that means they work
harder the boys right they wouldn't they
got a degree and they're working hard
they're more educated but I still don't
want them because you know
countries they're from
countries so their people even
if they're really hardworking and they
got educated and and whatever just said
we don't want them so I wonder what the
operative factor isn't who they want to
let in and who they don't want to let it
why would you want more Norwegians to
come here right like that that was
that's what he was saying hey let more
Norwegians come here when Norway is just
colossal II left-wing I mean they are a
social democracy through and through
you're talking about you know a stronger
middle class single-payer paid vacation
time by law so if they're massively
left-wing and you're saying hey why
can't we have more people from that
massively left-wing country come here
well then that's an admission it's not
about politics he's not saying it's cuz
the politics of the country are shitty
when
he says says their countries
therefore don't let them in if it's not
based on politics what's it based on
based on race so you know I don't know
how anybody could argue that this is not
a bigoted thing to say of course it's a
big thing to say the implication was
keep out all people from these countries
because I've deemed them
countries which means the people from
there are inherently shitty all the
other factors don't matter merit doesn't
matter doesn't matter how hard they work
and by the way let me be clear about
something I don't I'm not even sure I'm
I'm in favor of a merit-based system
because the whole point of people coming
here is that and this is what it's been
all along oh I want to get a better life
and have a better future so I'm gonna go
there so even if people are from a
so-called country that doesn't
mean that the people leaving the
so-called country are hole
people like the idea what Trump's family
didn't come here why would they come
here were they coming from a country
that had troubles probably you know my
my family on my on my mom side was from
Italy going back I think my mom's
grandma was the one who came here right
so my great-grandma was the one who came
here and I guess they came from Italy
and they were thinking hey we're gonna
leave here and go to America because we
want to create a better future
so Trump's logic is to turn around and
say well stop coming from your
countries but again wouldn't the
argument be hey we're leaving because we
want to create a better life so the
ideas they want to come here and work
harder so I don't the logic breaks down
but even so he would never say that
about a place like Italy why because
they're white they're viewed as white
people who come from Italy so it's like
oh even though you were massively poor
when you came here and all that stuff
that good people trying to get ahead but
when it's people from Africa or El
Salvador or Haiti who want to do the
exact same thing and the statistics show
they actually do that where the hell
we're gonna go get edge
at a much higher rate than the rest of
the country and yada yada he's like no I
still don't want you here why what's the
only factor left you tell me and it look
it's a ridiculous conversation to have
anyway about Trump's bigotry and I say
that because if you don't realize at
this point that he's a bigot you're just
not sure you're lying to yourself or
you're just ignorant
on his history so this was an
interesting tweet I thought from Keith
Boykin when did you know Trump was
racist one housing discrimination let's
just pause right at the first one there
that's one that many people don't know
it was reporter early on when Trump ran
for president but then it kind of went
away Trump and his dad owned owned
buildings and they refused to rent to
black people yeah strike one you're out
if you're gonna refuse to rent to black
people again isn't that like the
definition of racism and bigotry yeah I
own a building and it's like Black's
need not apply I don't care about your
income I don't care about your situation
I don't care about the content of your
character I don't I don't care we don't
it's red lining sorry you're not allowed
in this part of town Trump and his dad
were sued over that they had to go to
court okay that's just number one we're
on here
number two the Central Park five lied
that's when Trump wanted the death
penalty for people who turned out to be
innocent people of color who turned out
to be innocent of a crime he called for
the death penalty for them and he had no
evidence of their guilt but he said I
don't I want to kill them and then even
after they were proven in US and he was
like yeah we should kill him anyway
birtherism is another one yeah Wow the
first black president of the US he
wouldn't shut the up about oh he's
not bored here are these from where are
these from Kenya he's from somewhere
else oh he showed his long-form birth
certificate I don't care I want to see
his uh oh he showed his short form birth
certificate I don't care I want to see
his long-form oh he showed his long-form
I don't care I want to see his college
 transcripts weird thing he never
said that about Bill Clinton it has to
be the first black president for him to
say that number four called Mexicans
drug dealers that's when he launched his
camp
they're coming over the border they're
criminals they're rapists I assume some
are good people number five the ban on
Muslims that's is such a clear example
of bigotry he wants to ban all Muslims
all Muslims all Muslims because al-qaeda
exists so in his mind what's he saying
hey any Muslim is close enough to
al-qaeda I don't give a I don't
care if they're Shiite I don't care if
they're moderate Sunni I don't care if
they're Sufi I don't care if they're a
Mahdi I don't care about the different
schools of thought I don't give a
it's all basically the same in my mind I
want to ban all Muslims
I want to ban all of them how can
anybody argue that that's not bigotry I
don't it's hard to wrap your mind around
it that he anybody could argue because
what he's saying is they're all close
enough to the worst kind so I'm just
gonna lump all of them in with the worst
kind and just say we're just gonna keep
all of them out and by the way that's
literally what he said we want a total
and complete shutdown of Muslims coming
into the u.s. he announced that in a
speech now when he did his Muslim ban
what happened it was unconstitutional so
they had to water it down more and then
watered down more and then watered down
more and then water it down more and it
still got slapped down because you can't
do it then we have the pardon for Joe
Arpaio who was discriminating and just
asking people with brown skin for their
papers when he said that the Nazis who
were chanting white lives matter and
Jews will not replace us at that Richard
Spencer rally to keep up a Confederate
Monument that's what they were
protesting for to keep a Confederate
Monument up he said some of them very
fine people on both sides on both sides
they're very fine people then he
endorsed slaves supporter Roy Moore by
the way that's literal he said Roy Moore
said isn't it you know things seem to go
smoother back in those times I don't
know how anybody could deny the Trump's
a bigot at this late date but I want to
give throw a little plot twist at you
here so that's Trump's
country's remark and you know my take on
it but there's another angle to this
that annoys the out of me which is
the reaction from
Democrats so look at this top dem is to
introduce resolution to censure Trump /
 countries remark now you might
be thinking well Kyle why does this
annoy you because this is Democrats
saying yes we agree that he's a bigot
we're gonna censure him
that's so we're on your side okay here's
why this annoys me this is what we call
Mick resistance this is Mick resistance
Trump's bigotry and stupidity allows
Democrats to resist without resisting
nothing hinges on your shitty attempt to
censure him over the country's
remark but they'd rather how many
Democrats are going to back this while
at the same time simultaneously voting
to give Trump more spying powers which
is what just happened 55 Democrats said
yeah we want to allow him to do
warrantless surveillance on the entire
country so for them to allow him to do
spying by the way I thought you said he
was Putin's puppet now you're in favor
of him spying on everybody so doesn't
that mean you're Putin's puppet too but
this is the point man this is this is
what they do they say oh we're so
against him he's such a bad person now
let me vote with him on everything that
actually matters so another
point is how about fighting for the
dreamers there's this whole dacha fight
that's going on now democrats said we're
gonna huff and we're gonna puff and
we're gonna blow your house down and we
will stand strong and shut down the
government if you don't give us a clean
DREAM Act then what did they do push
came to shove and they were like anyway
we're folding and we're not gonna force
a clean DREAM Act so as they're they're
doing fake fighting yeah we're gonna
fight Trump on policy yeah we're gonna
we're gonna look out for the dreamers
watch out anyway we fold and you can
have whatever you want a Republicans but
then they'll turn around and they'll say
oh we're proposing to censure Trump over
his country's remark
sir how dare you say something I am so
against you gosh golly I'm so against
you you said mean things and used foul
language we're against you and we're
gonna stand united on this front to say
that you shouldn't have said whole
countries but nothing hinges on that
people's lives hinge on looking out for
the dreamers their lives hinge on that
but you're not fighting on that front
you're fighting over the ocean whole
countries how dare you say that this is
the problem is that trumps vulgarity and
idiocy and bigotry allows Democrats all
they have to do is go you're a bad
person mr. president you're mean you say
bad words we don't like it when you do
that and then peep idiots in the press
go oh so brave brave of the Democrats to
agree with Donald Trump on everything
policy wise but wag their finger when he
uses bad language so that's what's so
 frustrating about this this is
this is virtue signaling and fake moral
posturing by the mick resistance and
then let me show you one more here
because this annoyed me to Stephanie
ruhle chokes up when recounting having
to hide Trump's comments from her kids
that's what led in MSNBC host to tear up
hide the kids literally hide them now
look I just did a whole thing about how
I agree those are bigoted comments
through and through with terrible things
to say and he is a bigot of course
absolutely but this is gonna be the
issue that leads you to tear up on air
where the were you to tear up when
Trump's first military raid as president
killed a young American girl his very
first military act as president killed a
young American girl in a botched raid
where were you to cry when when Trump
increased drone strikes four hundred and
thirty two percent by the way under
Obama drones killed 90% civilians 90%
civilians where were you to cry for that
where were you to cry for I don't know
the children
of Gaza when they were slaughtered in
2014 by terrorists Benjamin Netanyahu
and his bloodbath in there where were
you to cry then where were you to cry
for all the innocent civilians that died
when we continuously bomb eight
different countries which we're doing
right now where were you to cry when
they got rid of the rules of engagement
in Somalia that's gonna endanger lives
even more so where were you to cry for
all these things where were you to cry
for the 45,000 people that die every
year because they don't have access to
basic health care in the United States
where were you to cry for that where
were you to cry for the UN report that
just came out that said extreme poverty
in rural America is just as bad as in
third-world countries
where were you to cry for that where
were you to cry for Edward Snowden who's
hiding overseas even though he's a hero
whistleblower who exposed the crimes of
our own government where were you to cry
for that because you're not serious
people you're not serious people all you
do in the establishment press is for
what's the hot-button issue of the day
Oh Trump cursed let me cry on air cuz of
my kids all my kids my kids my kids god
damn it man
your moral outrage meter is broken and
it's been broken all along there's
roughly three or four different stories
every single day that can lead you to
cry where I would forgive you if you
cried on air and I might even do a
segment where I say this is a brave
segment where she's showing human
emotion over an issue that truly should
evoke human emotion the slaughtering of
innocent civilians overseas where were
you to cry for the people of Yemen the
people of Yemen who are routinely being
slaughtered by Saudi Arabia backed by
the United States as we arm them out the
wazoo they attack open-air markets they
attack mosques they attack schools
hospitals there's over a million people
who are suffering from a cholera
outbreak in Yemen totally preventable
but why do they have a cholera outbreak
because Saudi Arabia's blockading the
country and stopping medical supplies
and food from going in and we agree with
it we're totally fine with it where the
 your tears for that issue where
your dears you don't have them cuz
you're not serious
you're a corporate prop that
they throw out there to do Mick
resistance and then you turn around and
agree with Trump on policy that sure
will fold for daca but oh he said
all countries oh oh my children my kids
I don't want to hear another
word to Mick resistance I'm so sick of
it I'm so sick of it I'm so sick of the
he cursed have you no decorum sir can't
you can't you go back to slaughtering
innocent people and being massively
corrupt politely why can't you do that
like Obama and Bush so sick of it stop
with the Russia Russia Russia oh
oh oh he's a puppet now let's vote for
him to spy on everybody let's have
warrantless spying on everybody let's
give this maniac free reign I'm so
against him he's Putin's puppet he
curses it's bad anyway here's
warrantless spying powers here's
authorization for another war
here's you know tacit agreement of your
goldman sachs pact administration the
democrats are never gonna connect their
outrage back to policy because they
agree with him much more on policy than
they would like you to know
so today is uh Martin Luther King Day
and I want to do what I've been doing
pretty much every Martin Luther King Day
which is lay out for everybody the parts
of his history that the mainstream of
society doesn't want to talk about so
the part of his history that everybody's
okay with talking about at this late
date is the idea of equality you know I
mean when you look at the horrific
systemic discrimination against black
people in the United States of America
it's undeniably disgusting you have
slavery and you have segregation and Jim
Crow and you now of course the the next
phase of that is the war on drugs where
some people call that the new Jim Crow
because it's used to crack down on
people of color and poor white people
and you just throw them in a cage for
tweaking their own consciousness
slightly and that the u.s. jails more
people than every other country on earth
which is a really wild thing to think
about that
for example we jail more people than
China shows you something's deeply wrong
with how we're doing it here but the
part that everybody will talk about now
is just the idea of hey equality we
shouldn't have segregation we should
have equal protection under the law even
like people who may be genuine racists
will tell you that even if they are that
and most of them will deny it but
they'll say well of course everybody
shut it you should have equal protection
under the law you know of course you
know wait we shouldn't have a [ __ ]
colored water found in a white water
fountain even most racist at this point
will go yeah no you separate the water
fountains that's that's nuts
and so this demonstrates one of the
oldest tricks in the book which is they
deny you they deny you they deny you and
then once you win they turn around and
go oh obviously of course I was on that
side all along I don't know what you
mean
and it's a classic case of if you can't
beat them join them you know and this is
why many Republicans nowadays say Omar
Luther King jr. as a Republican any vote
Republican view
around today because they know you're
not gonna win that debate anymore
the debate of hey was he one of the good
guys are one of the bad guys they used
to fight that back in the day now they
know oh we can't we can't win if we say
he's the bad guy
so okay can't beat him join it but he's
one of us he's been with us all along I
don't know what you mean
so yeah exactly so do you need to
understand that but again that's the
portion of his legacy that everybody
will talk about and everybody tries to
steal it
Republicans probably go oh yeah he was
with us and that's why we all agree he's
great but he's more with us than he is
with you the part of his legacy that
people kind of push off to the side
sweep it under the rug and shush about
it is Martin Luther King was a committed
anti-imperialist he was also a committed
Democratic Socialist now you can say
Kyle that you put in your own spin on it
but you would be wrong if you say that
so of course I'm gonna give you some
quotes here to back it up
in a letter to Coretta Scott King in
1952 he said this quote I imagine you
already know that I am much more
socialistic in my economic theory than
capitalistic and yet I yet I am not so
opposed to capitalism that I have failed
to see its relative merits it started
out with a noble and high motive to
block the trade monopolies of nobles but
like most human systems it falls victim
to the very thing it was revolting
against so today capitalism has outlived
its usefulness it has brought about a
system that takes necessities from the
masses to give luxuries to the classes
so he continued on this topic in 1966
which is years later and he said this
there must be a better distribution of
wealth and maybe America must move
toward a democratic socialism call it
what you may call it democracy or call a
democratic socialism but there must be a
better distribution of wealth within
this country for all of God's children
now think about what he said there and
think about how he's gonna be portrayed
today everybody's gonna act today like
we got hit his dreams were achieved he
had a dream dreams were achieved it's
over let's wrap it up and all go home
and have a sandwich that's how he's
gonna be discussed today but I just told
you one of his the things he was most
interested in was the distribution of
wealth being unfair let me ask you a
question if Martin Luther King jr. knew
that the richest six people in the world
have more wealth than the bottom 50% of
the world combined what do you think his
reaction would be six people more wealth
than over 3.5 billion people combined
what would his reaction be to half of
workers in the u.s. making $30,000 a
year or less what would his reaction be
to 20 million uninsured 45,000 people
dying in the United States
every year because they don't have
access to basic health care what would
his reaction be pretty sure his reaction
would be why the [ __ ] are we stopping to
celebrate my legacy without bringing up
these very important facts and trying to
fix them what are we doing here because
again everybody's gonna act today like
well man what a hero and he made it he
we he won Civil Rights Act Voting Rights
Act let's move along and even if you
look at him through that narrow lens
which is what the mainstream does how
many people are going to bring up that
the Supreme Court axed many provisions
of the Voting Rights Act recently how
many people are gonna bring up
gerrymandering which is still a gigantic
problem how many people are gonna bring
up voter ID laws where the specific
purpose is to block more people of color
from voting therefore making it more
likely that the Republican wins how many
people gonna bring that up
not many right how many of you looking
to bring up the war on drugs to say oh
my goodness look at this this is used
for social control this is used to crack
down on people of color and poor white
people
and throw them in prison and take away
their power in fact it's not just me
saying that it's Richard Nixon's but top
officials saying that they came out and
admitted a few years ago yeah that was
the whole point the whole point of the
drug war was to do social control we
knew that the hippy white people and
people of color weren't gonna vote for
us so what do you do I don't know try to
criminalize their what they do you
eliminate a problem that way and we
still have that system in place but
people will act today like I don't know
what you're talking about
we got the Voting Rights Act we got the
Civil Rights Act where's the problem
so in April 1967 Martin Luther King gave
a speech at Riverside Church in New York
City and in that speech he called the US
government quote the greatest purveyor
of violence in the world if somebody
says that today they're left out of the
room which is funny because our
government is just as militaristic as it
was then now he was referring to the
Vietnam War I wonder what he would have
thought of the war in Iraq an offensive
war against the country that didn't
attack us where minimum 200,000
civilians were killed and by the way we
did torture which is illegal under
international law and illegal under
domestic law we have an Eighth Amendment
protection from cruel and unusual
punishment in the Constitution that's
considered a ban on torture but we
tortured anyway we have an extra
judicial prison Guantanamo Bay still
open to this day I wonder what Martin
Luther King would think about that he
called the u.s. the greatest purveyor of
violence in the world right now we're
bombing 8 different countries 8 8 we
have nine hundred military bases around
the world that cost a hundred billion
dollars a year to maintain when you pull
the rest of the world and you ask which
country is the biggest threat to world
peace they answer the u.s. by far it's
not even close we crush every North
Korea they say we're a bigger threat
then Rush
they say we're a bigger threat than
Saudi Arabia they say we're a bigger
threat then and he said back then the my
government is the biggest purveyor of
violence on earth today now you would
think based on how everybody treats
Maher Luther King today that it's like
everybody's saying that every step of
the way I don't know what you mean he
was beloved every step of the way that's
why we celebrate him today it's so
obvious that he was right about
everything
no people fought him tooth and nail not
only that people fight him he was a lone
voice in the wilderness back then
standing up for things that were right
so the entire establishment elitist
liberal media will act like Martin
Luther King amazing so correct on
everything and everybody knew that
interesting listen to this the New York
Times editorial board blasted Martin
Luther King for linking the war in
Vietnam to the struggles of civil rights
and poverty they said it was quote too
facile a connection and that he was
doing a disservice to both causes they
said they're quote are no simple answers
to the war in Vietnam or to racial
injustice in this country the Washington
Post editorial board said that King had
quote diminished his usefulness to his
cause his country and his people for
speaking out against Vietnam I got it
was nice when you were talking about hey
maybe we shouldn't be overtly
discriminatory against people for having
a different skin color that was all fine
and dandy we tolerated that but now
you're gonna talk about not doing
imperialism and militarism you've uh you
know your usefulness has diminished and
then get this in all 168 newspapers
denounced him after he gave his speech
coming out strongly against the Vietnam
War where he fundamentally said we
are the terrorists here as we are the
government is we're using napalm and
Agent Orange on innocent villagers women
and children killing over a million
people innocent people
why Vietnam is not about to invade
Nebraska what are we doing here he comes
out strongly against that 168 newspapers
denounced him I'm willing to guess that
of the 168 newspapers all the ones that
are not bankrupt defunct today are gonna
sing MLK his praises now aren't they
Hafiz obviously he was right every step
of the way and everybody knew that don't
go back and look at our history of
denouncing him President Johnson
immediately terminated his relationship
with MLK when MLK came out strongly
against Vietnam and he said quote what
is that goddamned n-word preacher doing
to me we gave him the Civil Rights Act
of 1964 we gave him the Voting Rights
Act of 1965 we gave him the war on
poverty what more does he want man is
that a telling quote in other words
that's that's LBJ saying I don't deserve
any credit for all the good things I did
for the good things I did Civil Rights
Act Voting Rights Act War on Poverty I
don't even deserve credit for that
because what he's admitting is it wasn't
me it was MLK and it was the civil
rights movement that pushed me to that
position and what do you want of Corti
conceded and did the right thing in
these few areas so back up off me why
can't I slaughter innocent civilians in
Vietnam now that I gave you I was trying
to appease you by giving you a few of
the things you wanted and now you want
to like end the wars and stop massacring
people that's indicative of the entire
Democratic Party today today they don't
do things cuz oh I am ekran equality
Sheen who takes a tremendous amount of
money from Wall Street in the
military-industrial complex and the
private insurance companies
I was willingly going to do the right
thing no we have to force them to do the
right thing it's the same dynamic at
work today 100 percent this is what
happened with
medicare-for-all for example what was it
50 House Democrats that supported it and
you guys made it over 120 because you
said no no no we're not gonna take no
for an answer we're gonna vote you out
if you don't do this so to save your own
ass you're gonna come have to come out
in support of Medicare for all
how telling is that he's like what do
you want I gave you a few things that
you wanted now you want me to stop
massacring people how dare you well it's
because he actually cared about the
issues you're not gonna buy off him as a
constituency like oh I guess you'll back
my slaughter of innocence after I give
you a little bit of what you want [ __ ]
that no he's fighting for the right
thing which is why he didn't stop
fighting for the right thing and let's
be clear he wasn't just standing up
against the establishment which he was
he was standing up against the sentiment
of the entire country see we're under
the misimpression today that oh I guess
the people are always anti-war because
that's what the polls show today even
though we're still interact still in
Afghanistan only 17% of America still
wants to be in Afghanistan but were
there no backyard Vietnam the war fever
was peaking and so the propaganda from
the government convinced the population
know who really should be there so the
polls showed the people were for Vietnam
in fact a Harris Poll conducted after
Kings Vietnam speech found that only 25%
of even African Americans supported him
in his anti-war turn only 9 percent of
the public at large agreed with his
objections to the war 9 percent he was
one of the nine percent who stood up and
said this is wrong and I'm gonna explain
why and of course he also launched the
Poor People's Campaign in 1968 he wanted
what he called a quote grand alliance
between working people of all races to
fight for a brighter future to fight for
a living wage to fight for a job
guarantee from FDR's economic Bill of
Rights these are the things he supported
he was a Democratic Socialist
he said injustice inequality in health
care is one of the worst forms of
injustice that's a clear call for a
Medicare for All system a single-payer
system so today when you hear people
talk about them they're not gonna bring
up his democratic socialism they're not
gonna bring up his anti-imperialism why
because most of the people you hear talk
about him are gonna be in the
establishment they're gonna be elitist
to one degree or another whether it's a
certain newspaper outlet whether it's
CNN or MSNBC and if they don't bring up
his anti-imperialism
and they don't bring up his democratic
socialism then they're gonna give you
you the misimpression that his work is
done and you can go home and watch some
TV you don't need to be an activist you
don't need to fight you don't need to
protest you don't need to call your
Congress people you don't need to throw
your weight around you don't need to
organize it's done that's why we're
celebrating it's over that's it
Voting Rights Act Civil Rights Act move
along don't look into this thing any
further if they painted an accurate
picture of him that'd be a dangerous
thing for them now wouldn't it because
then all of us would be out in the
streets and we'd be fighting for
Medicare for all a living wage free
college and the wars legalize marijuana
and the drug war a new New Deal
so remember to keep fighting for his
legacy because he was right and if he
was around he would tell you my work
isn't even 20 percent done son so let's
keep fighting that's what he would tell
you don't let the establishment pull the
wool over your eyes and act like it's
over it's done man what a great hero
good thing we accomplished things
everything we were looking for and now
we could just all relax
no they hated him at the time the
establishment despised him at the time
despised him and now they turn around
and say his work is done and by the way
we totally supported all of his work
it's a trick and it's a trap well I'm
here to tell you about that trap so you
know how to react and you know to keep
fighting for his legacy because his
legacy is right
morning consult and Politico did a poll
of the top 2020 contenders against Trump
so they went through the Democratic
field and I want to go ahead and show
you their results and I think you'll
notice something up front in terms of a
problem with this poll so they say that
Biden's favorability among the base is
74% then you have Elizabeth Warren 51%
Al Franken 45% even though he you know
stepped down over sexual misconduct
allegations you have cory booker 37% Tim
Kaine are as I call him the human
saltine cracker Tim Kaine 37% Andrew
Cuomo the governor of New York 35%
Kirsten Gillibrand 28% Kamala Harris 27%
senator Christopher Murphy of
Connecticut 23% governor steve bullock
of montana who a grand total of eight
people have even heard of 21 percent
terry mcauliffe of virginia corporate
Democrat extraordinaire Blue Dog
Democrat extraordinaire 22 percent Amy
Klobuchar 20 percent John Hickenlooper
19 percent again John Hickenlooper it
sounds more like a serial than a than a
politician Starbucks executive Howard
Schultz is this getting a little
ridiculous to you 21 percent
former Missouri Secretary of State what
the [ __ ] Jason Kander 19 percent Los
Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti 19 percent
Disney CEO Bob Iger 19 percent governor
jay Inslee of Washington 17 percent Seth
Moulton of Massachusetts okay come on
now say 16 percent so what they did for
this poll is they basically said all
right name anybody and they're gonna be
a 2020 contender for the Democrats to
take down Trump so go ahead name anybody
you want like a random state senator
from Wyoming let's say 26 percent they
have a 26 percent favorability among the
Democratic base
so they just threw all the names against
the wall here and asked everybody what
their take is and you know these are the
results so of course the main headline
that everybody's walking away with is
you know Joe Biden favorite among the
Democratic base followed by there's my
barn yes yeah now you probably have
already noticed the problem with this
poll but if you haven't think about it
for a second who was left off Bernie
Sanders they put [ __ ] John
Hickenlooper they put a breakfast cereal
they put a human saltine cracker they
put people that nobody knows who the
[ __ ] they are Jason Kander Steve Bullock
is that Sandra Bullock's dad but they
didn't put Bernie Sanders they are gonna
come up with every trick in the book in
2020 to deny Bernie Sanders they are
gonna bend over backwards they're gonna
do mental gymnastics in a way that you
and I have never seen we already learned
about one of their tricks which Howard
Dean showed us on MSNBC when he said Oh
Oh see I I think this is the Democratic
Party has to change and the progressives
are taking over the Democratic Party
that's a good thing but it's because of
that that we have the young people
taking over the party that I want a
young candidate so forget Bernie Sanders
I Kamala Harris Cory Booker how about
that so you see the trick it's oh I
agree with the young Millennials which
is why I'm going to support somebody
who's younger for a president and not
Bernie Sanders but way hold on it's the
young people who want Bernie Sanders so
what are you doing that's called a bait
and switch oh I'm totally with you
that's exactly I agree a hundred percent
with you which is why I'm against Bernie
Sanders and I'm for somebody younger
who's a corporatist
it is a sad trick who every
which everybody's gonna see through but
now look at mean this is just a snub
beyond snubs because guess what when
they craft these polls they sit around
in a room you know it's the people of
morning consult but really the people at
Politico because they're the ones who
you know got the people of morning
console to do the poll for them there's
a polling company but Politico were the
ones who said we want to do a poll on
the 2020 contenders and they all sat
around our room and they said okay who
are we gonna put on this list and you
think Bernie wasn't brought up by
somebody of course Bernie was brought up
by somebody and they were like no we're
gonna leave him off the list why stuff
things don't care leave them off the
list because the establishment and the
corporatists will never take him
seriously and they'll never take him
seriously because he doesn't want to
play ball with them the corporate is in
the establishment are like yeah [ __ ]
that guy we'd rather have former
Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander
on the list Disney CEO has anybody even
[ __ ] mention that guy thought of that
guy nobody cares about any of these
people and by the way it's not like we
don't have old poll numbers so you know
they say uh Joe Biden's the front-runner
seventy-four percent favorability among
the base
what's Bernie's favorability among the
base over eighty percent and that's why
he's left out - it's hard for the
establishment to write articles going
are our enemy is the one who's the
front-runner so we're gonna pretend I
mean we've seen this also with Justice
Democrats we just covered the story the
other day about how Alison Hartson
senator Feinstein's strongest opponent
literally based on grassroots support
based on money raised from the
grassroots because she takes no
corporate PAC money whatever metric you
want to use number one contender they
downplay er they said of the most
prominent contender is Kevin de Leon who
negative for people care about so they
just they try to snub you in every way I
mean it was Politico who wrote the
article that said Bernie Sanders
supporters largely giving you know the
establishment wing of the party a pass
based on what based on what
there are so many great candidates who
are primary corporate Democrats and
everybody started busting ass and
working really hard from day one after
the 2016 election so the only way you
can come to that conclusion is if you're
covering your eyes and you're covering
your ears and you're saying I'm going to
I already wrote the article before
looking at the evidence so they didn't
look at the evidence they didn't look at
the facts on the ground they didn't look
at the over 50 candidates that are
primary Congress people and and Senators
they just said I'm just gonna hi this is
what I want to be true and this is the
narrative then my corporate overlords
want me to push so that's what I'm gonna
do in other words the idea is do cactus
you don't have a choice you don't have a
choice I just want the Democratic base
to understand you don't have a choice
we've made you fall in line election
cycle after election cycle and now we're
gonna continue to make you fall in line
election cycle after election cycle and
even when it is beyond obvious and it's
in everybody's face that there is a
giant coup happening they got what
that's what no Bernie's he's named on
the list so what about you that you want
to support [ __ ] Disney CEO Bob Iger
what that's who you should support
because he's on the list we added a
middle list we have we have determined
in our smoke-filled back room to leave
Bernie off the list because he might
hurt our corporate profits so you know
he's just not on the table there are no
you know primary challengers to
establishment Democrats I guess you're
gonna have to sell first out from
Democrats again this is what they do man
you know and you wonder why alternative
media outlets new media outlets like
mine and there are many others out there
why we're rising in popularity we're
rising in popularity not because we're
great but more because the mainstream is
beyond pathetic and they suck and they
just they lie to you
they're either massively ignorant or
they're lying to you and this is
something that you think like what
people you think people are not gonna
think of Bernie Sanders who is their
favorite to be the 20/20 nominee just
cuz you wrote your shitty little article
and excluded him and you did your shitty
poll and you excluded him even though
you you know added I don't know some
[ __ ] state representative from North
Dakota it's not we're not just gonna
forget about Bernie we're not just gonna
forget about the corporate Democrats and
the DNC rigging the primary the last
time around and how you know the
corporate Democrats don't support
Medicare for all they don't support free
college they don't support a living wage
they don't want to end the wars they
still take corporate money we're not
just gonna forget cuz you know unlike
perhaps some older generations we we
don't give a [ __ ] about your flowery
rhetoric and whether or not you look
presentable and you look like a shiny
polished politician well we care about
his [ __ ] policies so you're not gonna
pull the wool over our eyes anymore but
this is like it's just such a grotesque
example of that like what do you think
you're accomplishing here like oh you
were all just gonna forget about oh look
at this list a Bernese on on the list i
guess he doesn't account for anything
anymore
look you've been trying to do that all
along and the guys the the most favorite
politician in the country literally
doesn't matter how you ask it when you
ask people in their respective states so
you go to Vermont for Bernie you go to
Kentucky for Mitch McConnell and you ask
their constituents Bernie is the most is
the everybody's favorite politician so
everybody's favorite senator they
self-report hey this guy is a great
senator he's number one in the country
by far now when you don't do it on a
state-by-state basis and ask their own
constituents you just ask the entire
country Bernie still wins so and then of
course there were all the polls where he
destroyed Trump you know Hillary had a
maybe a three point or four point lead
on average nationally over Trump within
the margin of error Bernie had an 11
point lead 12 point lead on Trump not
within the margin of error and of course
the people who Bernie was accused of
having too much support of so we're
criticism are the people who could have
won this election and made Donald Trump
not president so point is and I think
you all get it it's overwhelming the
evidence that we have right now is
overwhelming that Bern
would have won Bernie's still the most
favorite politician in the country
Trump's numbers are tanking Hillary's
numbers are tanking Bernie's numbers are
rising because the more people hear him
the more they like him because they know
oh I think that guy's looking out for me
because he's been saying the same thing
for decades the things that he wants are
things that help working people but it
is because of those things that shitty
Politico and morning console just go
they leave him off our poll
leave the [ __ ] frontrunner off our
poll of the 2020 contenders for the
Democrats we can't let them do to Bernie
what they did to Bernie in 2016 we can't
let him do it we have to fight back
three times as hard we have to they have
to hear us roar they have to not deny us
because you know I keep saying this but
it's more true than ever nobody's coming
to save us we have to come to save
ourselves so that means you spread the
word through word-of-mouth you are the
ones who are boots on the ground
knocking on doors to get the word out
making phone calls and this goes for
every great candidate that's out there
whether it's Paula Jean Swearengen in
West Virginia
whether it's Allison Hartson in
California you have to be the ones to
spread the word to put the time in to
make the donations because there every
single thing they bias against us
because guess what in a true free
marketplace of ideas and policies we win
ten out of ten times because it's just
clear look on hey here's a sheet of
paper with what our candidates are for
here's a sheet of paper with what the
corporate Democrats are for who do you
want 10 and a 10 times people because
hey I want this person I want the
populist left person so since that's the
case that's why they feel like we have
to rig it we have to rig it we just to
leave Bernie off the pole pretend like
there's no primaries happening anyway
that this is why they have to do these
dirty tricks because they can't win in a
straight-up fight so when they when
they're totally indifferent and they
don't cover us at all
when
they take just colossal amounts of
corporate money and we take no corporate
money even though our ideas are more
powerful they have the upper hand
because there's a well-oiled machine
propping up the corporate us in the
establishment and snubbing us so but now
at least you have you know you have
shows like this where we can just go hey
wait this [ __ ] you see what's going
on here that's [ __ ] and we can begin
to fight back so don't let them win man
don't let them win I mean what kind of
sick [ __ ] is that you're gonna leave
them off the pole cuz there's no there's
no innocent explanation to that you know
what I mean so let's say you all did
forget you know uh whoops we just forgot
but you remembered [ __ ] Disney CEO
and John Hickenlooper and Amy Klobuchar
so if you real if you genuinely forgot
then you're a bunch of idiots and you
shouldn't be involved in them in
political media you should just move
along if whoops I forgot about the
[ __ ] frontrunner of the Democratic
Party on a poll of who should be the the
nominee in 2020 so that's inexcusable if

minute ago yeah I think I locked on 30
seconds yeah so I got I got the poll
questions for today man I was thinking
to god I got good ones for today I got
two polls that we're gonna do today cuz
I was trying to think of some [ __ ] but I
was like oh I can't really think of
anything well these are so good you're
gonna be like oh like I would have
thought of it if you didn't say it it
would have just came to you one night
cuz it's been there that straightforward
like these are like staples of the poll
question game that we could have asked
like the first time okay I'm ready for
him
oh are you eating the skittle says that
skittles nerds wrote let me see it hold
it up you got some hold up nerds a rope
you never had a nerds rule I don't think
I ever did no Oh what you can eat this
[ __ ] and then hang yourself with it if
you don't you can't make up your mind
what you want to do it's like it's like
a long gummy thing there's nerd stuff oh
that's good I like gummy gummy good you
know what I've had the meanest craving
for I talk about this all the time the
the old school WWF ice cream bars oh
yeah I've had the mean craving for them
on a level that like I didn't think was
possible and what's so frustrating to me
is that obviously now they don't exist
but nobody's like even it's not like
anybody else is thinking about maybe
making making it you know what I mean
like if they do like it'll be it'll be a
replica like it's not gonna be the
author you want one from like 1996
exactly like I don't know all
freezer-burned and [ __ ]
I don't know I think like good humor or
somebody makes it but I think so but I
bet that Vince McMahon is like no I'm
not gonna allow you to make it with like
it different well well kinnexa fell I
heard about that I heard XFL is coming
back gonna bring this [ __ ] back to me
except for ice cream bars maybe there's
hope then for the WWE ice cream bars or
XFL ice cream are as long as they're the
same [ __ ] taste of the old ones I
mean those were like seriously delicious
no I feel like when things come back out
that have been away for a while it's not
the exact it's not like the same you
know yeah like there's gonna I'm gonna
know right away though cuz I remember
exactly what those things taste like
they'll know on the first bite I'll be
like this is like a cheap knockoff yeah
that's um I'm trying to think of
something that like was big like back in
the day and they came back out with it
and then I was like Twinkie nuts well
Twinkies went away for like like a year
like they remodeled no they went out of
business and then somebody bought the
rights to make them mm-hmm but for the
second that like I even went out and
bought Twinkies when they were gonna go
out of business because I was like
they're like somebody might not buy them
again and then I will never live another
day of my life having eaten a Twinkie
yeah that's it tweek it's a wrap on
Twinkies so I went and I bought like
three boxes of Twinkies yeah it should
have kept them there probably still good
that's the that's the old thing is the
Twinkies like last forever because
you're so [ __ ] jacked up with
preservatives and [ __ ] exactly if you
see like all the zombie movies or any
like movies that's the truck you wanna
like find is like a hostess truck or
some [ __ ] if that [ __ ] probably has zero
nutritional value but it's so alysha's
so bad it's so [ __ ] up the good taste
the [ __ ] that tastes great is not good
for you yeah but then again there are
some things that are like kind of good
for you that taste good you know what I
mean but it's not so like like Mexican
food for example like the ingredients in
Mexican food are like good for you so
you should have good tasting Mexican
food and it's good for you you know what
I mean yeah yeah that's like the only
example I got yeah there's nothing like
that yeah there's nothing that hits the
spot like some [ __ ] bang and fried
chicken or some like Krispy Kreme
Doughnuts or some [ __ ] that's like you
eat it and you're like and this is
making me healthy yeah
Kayle you're not gonna be like oh my god
I'm have a craving for it it's like no
that doesn't happen it's so [ __ ] up
that that's it I died remember on the
sour powers that we get like the skinny
straw ones yeah you know it's got like
some like got some like kangaroo like
rabbit you lookin [ __ ] on the
front of it yeah yeah yeah mmm shower
pal they have on the bottom like they're
showcasing it it says fat-free on it
because they're fat-free like I guess
technically like through whatever
concoction Splenda and all this crazy
[ __ ] it's fat-free but mother [ __ ]
that's it yeah and plus like I think it
you know I was reading about how like
they tried to make it was the sugar
industry that tried to demonize fat for
the longest time and they were like
that's the problem fats the problem
that's the problem and don't worry about
sugar or carbs that's fine but fats are
the problem and then that was it's all
[ __ ] like you're supposed to have a
decent amount of fat in your diet the
thing you want to go lighter on is like
the carbs and the [ __ ] so everybody
was getting fat when they started eating
fat-free [ __ ] never he's like what the
[ __ ] is going on it's because you're
going nuts on like you're eating big-ass
bowls of pasta while you're eating some
fat-free [ __ ] and you think oh this is
gonna be good but no so that's like um
[ __ ] Oprah try to do that [ __ ] she
had like she was being Oprah and we'll
probably get to her later and help her
yeah but um she try to have this like
she came out with a whole weight-loss
thing or whatever and then her big motto
was like if you want to eat the bread
eat the bread Oh she'll still lose
weight and I was just like no I doubt
that work like I think like magazines
and [ __ ] came out later it was just like
yeah that didn't work
yeah there's no like none of the fad
diets work like I think there are a
bunch of actual there are a bunch of
diets that do work but I think that they
stand the test of time like you're never
gonna have I'm sure you all that looks
good I'm sure um everybody's seen those
commercials of like you know drink this
[ __ ] shake twice and you lose 30
pounds in a week it's like no [ __ ] stop
like the fad diets are [ __ ] or the
Newton the Nutri systems are over the
[ __ ] it's called it's like eating
[ __ ] cheeseburgers and
Fausta and you're gonna be good no but
there are different diets that work and
have different purposes like the
Mediterranean diet supposed to be very
healthy the diet that always made me
lose weight is a keto diet where your
body's in ketosis so it burns fat for
energy as a palooka to burning carbs for
energy sugar for energy so you just have
to eat a diet that's high in fat and
high in protein but yeah that was that
that's the [ __ ] that we do yeah that
we've done a bunch of times before is
your cholesterol levels could shoot up
and in the long run it might not be
great for your heart but I've seen
contradictory evidence on that so I'm
not sure exactly but in my point is that
that that is a diet where I know you
could lose weight on that because I have
you know what I mean yeah we've both had
results from that sure sure yeah
there's no shortcut though I mean
there's never a shortcut it's just
you're gonna have to sacrifice like the
big thing for me I'm Italian and I had
pasta like a [ __ ] all the time
growing up and then when I had to do
that diet there's just no more pasta
sorry you just can't have pasta no no
you want to cheat a little bit and cut
around the edges and usually you get
grilled chicken but you were like you
know what I'm gonna get a chicken parm
tonight okay like that's not as mine as
many carbs as a bowl of pasta but it
still carbs in that but you know you
should probably what they say like 30
carbs or less a day or something on that
diet if you wanted to do it ideally I
think yeah maybe yeah another you say
that I think that's what it is nothing
like you look at so [ __ ] everything has
everything carbs in it yeah that's like
that's nothing but everybody wants a
short cut I mean like yeah you can't
when it comes down to it you gotta work
out eat right you gotta like exaggerator
to be like hey what can I do in this
quick like two-week like no [ __ ]
you got to work out yeah you got to work
out and you got it you gotta eat at
least a clean-looking shortcut yeah well
you know what I've been I've been good
since I've been swamped if people were
wondering I've been sticking to my thing
from January 1st I haven't really [ __ ]
up yet the only things that and whatever
this is like semi cheating but every now
and then I have a bowl of cereal and
it's not a good cereal it's like a
shitty cereal but that's nothing wrong
yeah
what's the shitty cereal cereal of
choice Captain Crunch or Lucky Charms
bangers yeah they're good they're good
are you the type of dude that like I
think Lucky Charms was like we're coming
out with a marshmallow only cereal were
you a fan of that you need to mix other
thing in there yeah you can't just have
that but do you seek out the
marshmallows um
it's when you get a bite that has no
marshmallows that's a little bit of a
downer you want to have at least one
marshmallow in there you know yeah yeah
yeah no they're both good they're both
good I hadn't had Captain Crunch in a
long time but I was like damn comes to
play you know but outside of that it's
been a lot of grilled chicken you know
some brown rice vegetables you know I
drink that v8 [ __ ] all the time yeah I
saw that in the process but whatever
mm-hmm because I'm not gonna [ __ ]
what I'm gonna buy all natural like
ingredients and then grind it up in a
thing and I have time for that [ __ ]
wasn't my wife's been doing she makes
these smoothies and she has to eat uh I
think they're prunes or some [ __ ] damn
or I think it's prunes and she mix them
into her [ __ ] but they're like big-ass
raisin looking things yeah
best prunes I think yeah and like I like
the raisins but I think I like prunes no
I think it was [ __ ] yeah I think I tried
like prune juice and I'll leave this is
disgusting well it just sounds disgust
what I like raisins raisins are
delicious do you not like razors no no
I'm not a fan of raisins but I didn't
mind getting that little like it was a
red package right with that lady on the
go yeah yeah yeah yeah there's the
reasons California it was always mad
racist with like women and packages
ain't your mom remember Aunt Jemima mrs.
buttersworth that's to be our poll
because I'm tight and my wife she bought
mrs. buttersworth uh-huh and I said why
the [ __ ] didn't you buy Aunt Jemima like
answer mom is a [ __ ] when the first
Sarah Sarah yep yeah aunt you're my love
Andrew - Sarah oh my god but that [ __ ]
is dumb racist like [ __ ] the Washington
Redskins they should try to pull back
after Miami yeah they're like this is
our slave who we're putting on the phone
his [ __ ] Uncle Ben like food companies
were mad racist back in the day you know
it did centers that you're right about
that I think you're right about that but
at the same time I feel like it's been
around for so long that it's almost
the fact that it's racist cuz now it's
just Uncle Ben you know what I'm sayin
yeah but yeah right that the roots are
like San Francisco like cooking food
who's cooking food for like some white
dude yeah that's true yeah
I can't even live in San Francisco and I
got like [ __ ] job I got some money
like but I'm not cooking nothing I go
saying Francisco broke his [ __ ] okay so
you wanted to do Aunt Jemima versus Miss
buttersworth is one of the polls I gotta
add this to the list I don't know should
we do all three of these I'm thinking of
today or no man [ __ ] it I think Aunt
Jemima will win in a landslide that
might just be an easy one because I
don't think anybody [ __ ] with mrs.
buttersworth okay hold on I'm writing
this in okay we're gonna do today so
I'll just go right to the poll but here
are the ones I was thinking you're gonna
love these so the first one is who's
better or actually I don't even know how
I want to word this question because I
feel like I might want to word it by
like mess it mess it
messaging by bringing up MJ Michael
Jackson by saying like who's the best
since Michael Jackson or who's Michael
Jackson's heir apparent or okay and the
choices are usher Chris Brown or Justin
Timberlake that's a good poll question
that is good yeah
whoo you know I don't even my mind isn't
made up on this which is why I'm
bringing it up to you so that I could
hear your argument out because unlike so
much [ __ ] there's so many variables like
if you're like like a with it young like
light-skinned dude you're gonna pick
Chris Brown but if you're like a Corning
like white college kid you're gonna pick
Justin separately all right so okay so
that I anticipated you might say that
but what's interesting is you know you
know who Charlemagne is right yeah of
course yeah Charlemagne has a video up
from a few years ago where he was you
know doing an interview and he said
hands down Justin Timberlake is better
than Chris Brown and is the person who's
following Michael Jackson as the King of
Pop he said hands down and then he went
through a list of my justin timberlake
songs and was like you could like this
is a
Michael Jackson song I guess what this
is like I think you take back the night
and then he said remember when he did
that thing in like the MTV Music Awards
or some [ __ ] he did like all of his
songs and that [ __ ] went on for like 25
minutes and every one of his songs was
just banger banger banger banger banger
banger that's true you might have just
you might have just swayed me because I
think Justin Timberlake also embraces it
more than like Chris Brown is that dude
who plays basketball who's just got
crazy talent but like doesn't know how
to really like harness that [ __ ] in you
know so I don't think that makes him the
MJ like so okay so but now I feel like I
want to make an argument it's not that
crazy factor to beating women but put
all that aside for a minute because like
Michael Jackson was maybe did a little
little boys that's I'm saying that's a
pop made Michael Jackson Michael Jack
crispy I might get that so bad more
likely molest kids that's what the play
I think um I don't know man like to me I
think Justin Timberlake is great and but
there's like there's always a chance
that when I hear one of his songs at a
certain song I'm like may like most of
the time I'm like this [ __ ] is hot but
sometimes I'm like me did you hear his
newest [ __ ] that he just came out with
like it's okay like that's the same
thing that I thought right but when I
hear Chris Brown song it's almost a
guarantee I'm like this [ __ ] is gonna be
fire and then I hear and I'm like this
is fire that is true yeah like it but
that so but as over as a raw number
though Justin might have more songs that
are his that I love but it's a Garrett
it's like a guarantee that whatever song
Chris Brown releases I'm gonna love
where as uh sure uh sure's God forgot
about us her bangers but I for him I
feel like there's he doesn't release
enough you know what I mean I'm gonna
throw somebody else in the mix to go
ahead exciting tweet the poll yet Bruno
Mars I'll add him to the poll but [ __ ]
that guy he's out here too he's gonna
win the pole though that's the problem
is it you know like he'll get like 7%
[ __ ] [ __ ] with him but bet he's like
the more cookie-cutter one of all of
them even more than Justin Timberlake
yeah if anybody really is a second come
cutter he's like newer so people I love
Mars
you see they dig it you know he got
caught with like cocaine right and my
Vegas yeah that's why that [ __ ]
always working yeah he got like cocaine
charges or some [ __ ] in Vegas like
nightclub or something like that a
couple of years let him go let him go
[ __ ] you guys why you [ __ ] with
people [ __ ] okay so I'm just gonna put
who's better Justin Timberlake here's
okay my guess is this it's gonna be
close between Justin Timberlake and
Usher then you know it's gonna be Justin
Timberlake and Bruno Mars one in - uh
sure three Chris Brown four do you think
Chris Brown's in before I think he's
gonna be fourth because ever since the
thing with Rihanna even though we're
trying to put that aside for purposes of
the music people aren't gonna put that
aside you know yeah that's what I was
having that argument with someone the
other day or not the other day maybe a
month ago I was trying to say I could
still hear Chris Brown song and be like
that's a good song regardless of what he
did to Rihanna you know does that make
me [ __ ] up like I still thinks with 87
while he was married and that doesn't
mean he was not one of the best ever
best golfers ever [ __ ] saying like
there's a lot of Lucy Kate's still funny
yeah Louis okay there's another great
example yeah that he's hilarious but he
just jerks off in front of people
hey does weird [ __ ] not excusing it it's
just saying that that didn't take away
from his like that being that crazy of a
person maybe contributed to him being
such a brilliant comic but it also
contributed to him being [ __ ] up and
committing crimes sexually yeah I didn't
hear that [ __ ] and then be like Oh Louis
CK's not funny anymore okay so I'm
adding Bruno Mars to the poll right yeah
I think it needs to be added to that so
I just did who's better Justin
Timberlake Chris Brown Bruno Mars uh
sure and then do who would you rather
who would you rather the Spice Girls or
Hanson it's my sister saw Hanson in like
a New York City Street one time oh
really
did they look like her I live
really thought they were girls for a
while and then my sister was like no
they're there guys
I was like stop playing she's like no no
no they're guys I was like what I still
remember that like yeah yeah we could
have been girls in their first video
they all had long as they're playing the
drums and the song is like you know high
pitch they said they'd just come back
out with that song like it was so long
ago that they could come back out that's
a good foot you know I've thought of
that before like what if like a song
that was just super hot that just
CNN host Michael Smerconish talked about
Trump's mental health and he did it from
a perspective that's pretty unique and
surprising so I want to hear him out and
then we'll discuss one of the most
talked about aspects of Michael Wolfson
new book on President Trump has been
it's calling into question Trump's
fitness for office not just in terms of
his knowledge temperament and experience
but also his mental fitness and the last
one trends into territory that troubles
me let me explain in 1964 a magazine
called fact polled mental health
professionals on US Senator and
presidential candidate Barry Goldwater's
fitness to serve as commander in chief
the magazine published a cover story
claiming that many found him unfit after
the election Goldwater sued the editor
for libel and won this engendered a
debate in the mental health community as
to the propriety of rendering opinions
about an individual they'd never met
much less examined even if that person
is a public figure eventually this led
to the American Psychiatric Association
in 1973 adopting what's been known ever
since as the Goldwater rule which says
in part it is unethical for a
psychiatrist to offer a professional
opinion unless he or she conducted an
examination and has been granted proper
authorization for such a statement the
rule has been in place and was largely
respected for more than 40 years until
the candidacy and election of Donald
Trump his behavior led many to express
frustration at what they feel is a gag
rule claiming that they've seen enough
of Trump from his public utterances and
his tweets to decide a group of 27
mental health professionals went so far
as to collaborate on a book expressing
their concerns called the dangerous case
of Donald Trump and this week came news
that in early December the books editor
Yale University psychiatry professor dr.
ban DX Lee met on Capitol Hill with more
than a dozen members of Congress
concerned about Trump's recent behavior
now several quotes and episodes in
Michael Wolf's book have thrown fuel on
the fire of this debate including Steve
Bannon saying that Trump has quote
lost it on Friday when asked about
Trump's fitness for office on The Today
Show wolf said this let me put put a
marker in the in the sand here 100
percent of the people around him they
all say he is like a child and what they
mean by that is he has a need for
immediate gratification it's all about
him that some have questioned the
president's fitness is not new in fact
one election day poll found that 63% of
all voters thought that he lacked
temperament to serve effectively as
president that included 19 percent of
those who voted for him and those
numbers have not improved in the last
year but I don't think we should
encourage this sort of speculation first
its inexact and it's subjective second
it's unfair and unseemly just as I said
it was when some speculated about what
ailed Hillary Clinton when she took a
stumble on September 11 of 2016 I don't
distinguish between mental and physical
in respecting privacy but more
importantly I'm uncomfortable with the
idea of getting rid of the Goldwater
rule which was imposed for a purpose it
wasn't fair to Senator Goldwater that he
was the subject of armchair diagnosis
we'd set a dangerous precedent in
allowing our public servants to be
diagnosed by laypeople or professionals
who've never met them professionally we
might discourage some from seeking
public service and had this always been
the thinking we'd also have denied
ourselves many fine public servants if
we precluded those with mental illness
linked in a Churchill among them and why
stop with elected officials why not
speculate about the policeman or about a
cable anchor or a school principal or
even a psychiatrist not only is that
unfair to the person being spoken about
but it's unfair to those who are dealing
with mental health issues to have their
very real diagnosis become political
fodder if you want to impose a standard
that any person seeking the highest
office first be rendered mentally and
physically fit in a man
that applies to all okay but to
arbitrarily scrutinize one particular
candidate or officeholder at least in my
opinion is wrong now what if a certain
amount of instability is not a deficit
in a leader but an asset that was the
theme of a book that I read in 2015
which includes these statements when our
world is in tumult mentally ill leaders
function best and in the storm of crises
complete sanity can steer us astray
while some insanity brings us to port so
I think he's both colossal II wrong and
colossal II right at the same time so
let me explain exactly what I mean here
towards the end he's making the argument
hey what if mental illness in a leader
is a good thing and he's referencing a
book that made that argument that I
think argued Winston Churchill was a had
some mental illness and Abe Lincoln what
had I think severe depression and the
guy makes the connection between hey
mental illness and good leadership and
particularly when things are bad you
want somebody who's has some mental
illness issues because they're not
they're able to think outside of the box
you know that's I think in one of the
angles to the argument that they make
but I think overall that she's not
you're that's not nuanced enough of a
point so if you want to say hey mental
illness could be a benefit in a leader
but that's narrowly applied to mania for
example if somebody has mania issues
where they're you know really they move
really fast and they work at a really
fast pace and they think fast and they
kinda are ceaseless in in how hard they
work and stuff I'm totally open to that
idea in fact I could see that that does
make sense somebody that has some mania
issues some mild mania sure that that
person can be perhaps even a better
leader than somebody who doesn't have
that
even depression I can see the link there
you know I have a grandmother or had a
grandmother she's passed away now but
she was she had severe depression
throughout her life she also happened to
be one of the smartest people I'd ever
known in my life and you know I I don't
know if it's been proven or if it's just
speculation but there's been a lot of
discussion about how there might be a
connection between people who are
depressed and intelligence there's like
a link between all you're really
depressed but you're kind of morbid and
nihilistic and you're you're really
bright you're really intelligent so I
could see that too I'm open to the idea
that somebody with mania or somebody
with depression can be a superb leader
I'm open to the idea that somebody who's
really obsessive
you know really narrow-minded and
obsessive that that person can actually
be a good leader so I'm open to all of
that here's what I'm not open to and
here's where the where his point fails
and where it's not nearly nuanced enough
he's not drawing a distinction between
the different kinds of mental illnesses
you know talking about mental illness as
one blanket is like talking about drugs
as one blanket like all marijuana and
 crystal meth same thing like
what no no or marijuana and crocodile
which makes your skin rot off
almost immediately when you start doing
it it's the poor man's heroin Crocodylus
or bath salts yeah some guy ate some
guy's face off because of bath salts by
the way I don't know if that's actually
true I think that was the original
reporting and then it might have been
later they said no that didn't happen
but whatever like bath salts and weed
it's not the same thing man it's just
not let's stop don't it's not nuanced
enough to just say drugs by the same
token it's not nuanced enough to say
mental illness because somebody with
depression who could be a superb leader
that's not the same as somebody with
paranoid schizophrenia if somebody has
paranoid schizophrenia and they have
delusions and hallucinations where
they're seeing that is not there
and they can't and they don't have a
connection to objective reality
in a strong sense I'm not open to the
idea that that could be a benefit in a
leader I'm not I think that's a
ridiculous notion so you know you could
say that's unfair to people with
paranoid schizophrenia but I don't know
if the person has paranoid schizophrenia
but they're medicated and they never
don't take their medication and as a
result of being medicated then that
issue is taken care of and they can lead
when they're under the influence of
medication and they can connect with
reality that's fine but not when they're
unmedicated and they're paranoid
schizophrenic and they can't they have
hallucinations and delusions that's not
the same as somebody who's manic or
somebody who's depressive and they could
be a good leader it's not the same thing
so by the same token with Trump the
specific kind of mental illness that
people are speculating about is dementia
I wouldn't put that one in the category
of ones where you could be a great
leader again if you want to say mania or
depression or you know some obsessive
disorder and that person could be a
great leader again I can see that
totally not saying everybody who has
those things would be a great leader but
some people who have those things could
be great leaders sure but dementia is
one where look I've seen it the other
grandma I like how I'm mentioning both
my grandma's in this segment totally
random but my other grandmother when she
got to her older age she had old age
dementia and there's not there's nothing
about that that's Oh give this person
more power in control there's nothing
about that that that's that should be
your conclusion I mean that's like a
really terrible idea we're talking about
somebody who gets up at one o'clock in
the morning and thinks it's six o'clock
in the morning or seven o'clock in the
morning and they start cooking breakfast
and one o'clock in the morning and the
alarm goes off and they don't know what
the to do or they wake up in the
middle of the night and they're
screaming they start wandering random
places just walk out look it's a
difficult thing to deal with when people
have dementia now I'm not saying Trump
definitely has it or
doesn't have it to that level but
assuming that some of the reports are
true about how like when Melania was
standing right next to Mater rallies
like sorry Melania couldn't be with us
or the countless anecdotal examples of
people saying he'll tell a story and
then two minutes later with all the
exact same story and act like he didn't
just tell it two minutes ago if some of
those things are true dementia is not
one of the kinds of mental illnesses
that should be affecting a leader
certain ones sure that could be a great
leader and have them but other ones know
and dementia is one of those where I go
no where there's too much of a
disconnection from objective reality
where it's dangerous and you're not of
sound mind to make proper decisions so I
don't think he's being nuanced enough
and I honestly think overall his
argument is a little bit of like
honestly politically correct of
like oh how dare you maybe try to you
know try to say some people can't do the
job because of mental illness that's
exactly what I'm saying and that's right
some people can't do the job because of
certain kinds of mental illness other
kinds of mental illness might be totally
fine but certain kinds know it's really
dangerous and the point you're making is
a really bad point that has consequences
because here's ultimately what he's
trying to do he's trying to nip the
entire conversation in the bud and say
no the entire conversation about whether
or not Trump is mentally fit to be in
office it's an illegitimate conversation
so we're gonna nip it in the bud we're
gonna kneecap it this conversation
should not continue because you're being
like discriminatory or something against
people with mental illnesses and
therefore you can't have this
conversation well no come on man you
can't say that this is an illegitimate
conversation if the president actually
ends up having dementia that's a
dangerous situation for somebody with
dementia to be the most powerful person
on the planet okay so that's most of my
take I do have some other thoughts
though like for example the people who
talk about Trump's mental fitness
endlessly they annoy me just as much as
smear Khanna shy noise me hear
Smerconish is saying this is a total
non-issue you're not even allowed to
talk about it I think that's wrong
but it's also wrong when so many
corporate Democrats and corporate
Democrat apologists oh like all they
want to talk about is his Russia and his
mental fitness that's it
and they're doing that for a reason
they're doing that because they don't
know dick about policy and they're not
actually following the news to get the
actual information to argue against
Trump in a cogent and sufficient and
sound way so what they do is they go I
don't know low-hanging fruit what's the
low-hanging fruit
I hear he's Putin's puppet yeah Putin's
puppet Putin's puppet I hear he's a like
a legitimately crazy person and he you
know has dementia so uh he's unfit for
office he's unfit for office he's unfit
for office so I do kind of agree with
Samir Khan ich in that it's like the
people who only talk about that are just
they're dead weight in the
conversation they don't know anything
they don't care about policy so they're
just adding their voice to a chorus of
silliness we're like just because of how
I don't like him and how he is unhinged
that's why we should get rid of them so
they got nothing to say about tax policy
they have nothing to say about war they
got nothing to say about doing Wall
Street's bidding and nothing about any
of that Chinese unfit something so
that's like the lazy man's argument and
the ignorant person's argument when
they're anti Trump so that annoys me as
well
and I guess the final point I'll make on
this is Smerconish might be right on a
broader point though and that is the
that there's no if you go down this road
it's not gonna be an objective standard
so let's say Trump is ousted I don't
think this is likely to happen but let's
say Trump is ousted they use the 25th
amendment they say he's got he's
mentally unfit yada yada and he has
dementia whatever the case is you I
think are incredibly naive if you don't
realize that this will be used against
every president in a partisan way so
they'll say oh I don't agree look at
Obama oh my goodness look at the
terrible decisions that Obama made in
regards to backing Syrian rebels who
were jihadists which he did by the way
that's meh he's mentally unfit if you're
deciding to back people who are the same
kinds of people
who want to attacked us on 9/11 and I
mean what oh it's gonna be used people
are gonna take little Colonels little
nuggets like remember when Obama said
one there was 58 States or 54 States or
some somebody would say uh mentally
unfit eat it you don't know how many
 states there are obviously you
have some sort of deep-seated issue here
in your brain and we got to get rid of
you we don't have a choice we have to
get rid of you so if you're calling to
use it against Trump understand the very
it's gonna happen immediately with
somebody who you like who you don't want
them to use it against guaranteed
guaranteed and that's a point that's
worth making that all the hacks who want
to only talk about him being mentally
unfit today you know as soon as it's
used against their somebody they like
they will clutch their pearls and they
go oh how dare you this entire
conversation is now illegitimate to
speculate about whether or not a
president is unfit that's what's gonna
happen all the people who say it's
totally fair game now second it's use
against somebody they like ah totally
unfair never discuss that ever so there
that's pretty hacky and yeah I get his
point too about with other fields like
okay you want to open this door in
regards to the president what happens
when they start saying okay what about
this police officer what about this
firefighter what about this teacher what
about hey you maybe are mentally unfit
we've determined and it can be used as a
red herring to oust people in other
words the establishment might dislike
somebody because they're tough on the
establishment and then the establishment
uses the argument ah no it's not because
we don't like them that we're asking
them it's cuz they're mentally unfit so
it's it does open the door to genuine
discrimination but you know again my
notion here is I don't think it's an
illegitimate conversation to talk about
trumping unfit for office mentally unfit
for office I think people who only talk
about that or hacks and they're wrong to
only talk about that but in my mind it
just needs to be a very nuanced
conversation because certain kinds of
mental illness I don't see being a
problem and could even be a benefit but
Conn's yes are a problem and I think
that conversation is one worth having
but we should be aware of all the
pitfalls in the process
so there's an account on Twitter pretty
big account the account is called
pixelated vault boat and it's funny I
follow it I know a lot of people who
follow it and what he does is absurdist
comedy you know it's it's usually
heavily political but it's a you know a
healthy dose of just absurdist comedy
it's kind of comedy that I particularly
enjoy and with this new book that's
coming out fire and fury which details
what's going on in the Trump
administration what's actually happening
behind the scenes but there's been many
you know passages that leak here and
there about oh my God look at what Trump
said about this issue and look at what
Trump said about that issue and oh all
the advisers think he's an idiot
so what pixilated boat did in classic
pixelated boat fashion is he decided to
do a fake passage from the book and
tweet it out now again this is what he
does like he does he's not trying to
dupe anybody but I'm about to read you
this passage and then tell you the
reaction so pixelated boat says wow this
extract from Wolf's book is shocking
insight into Trump's mind and it says on
his first night in the White House
President Trump complained that the TV
in his bedroom was broken because it
didn't have the gorilla Channel Trump
seemed to be under the impression that a
TV channel existed that screened nothing
but gorilla based content 24 hours a day
to appease Trump White House staff
compiled a number of gorilla
documentaries into a makeshift gorilla
channel broadcast into Trump's bedroom
from a hastily constructed transmission
tower on the South Lawn however Trump
was unhappy with with the channel they
created moaning that it was boring
because the gorillas aren't fighting
staff edited out all the parts of the
documentaries where gorillas
weren't hitting each other and at last
the president was satisfied quote on
some days he'll watch the gorilla
Channel for 17 hours straight and
insider told me he kneels in front of
the TV with his face about four inches
from the screen and says encouraging
things to the gorillas like the way you
hit that other gorilla was good I think
he thinks the gorillas can hear him so
um you know my guess is that virtually
all of you hear that and you go wow
that's funny that's like a funny joke
tweet well guess what there are many
people on Twitter let's face it mostly
corporate Democrats or corporate
Democrat apologists who looked at that
and they thought the gorillas Channel
Donald Trump oh my god he wanted the
gorillas channel in his room it was it
Pixley to boat what he found in Michael
Wolf's book fire and fury is real so so
many people thought it was real it
started trending on Twitter that's a
fail on a level I wasn't sure was
possible so a few of the people who fell
for it
Erick garland is one this is a guy who
by the way has been one of the leading
voices in the Trump Russia conspiracy
this guy tries to connect dots and say
oh no he really is Putin's puppet and
Trump did treason and he's a Manchurian
Candidate and all that stuff one of the
leading voices in the Russia conspiracy
is so dim that he believed this obvious
joke about the guerrilla Channel don't
get me wrong I get it like Trump's a
[ __ ] idiot
so you know I'm trying to be kind here
if there was a somewhat similar passage
that
wasn't as absurd like if you reeled in
the absurdity like 50% yeah I could be
believable
it could be honestly the story could be
believable if it was just you know Trump
was upset that there wasn't a gorilla
Channel or something okay I can believe
that I could believe that you know I
bought a gorilla Channel there's no
gorilla Channel sad sad I could get that
but the details of this make it
obviously a joke
[ __ ] obviously so but this is what
we're dealing with now there was another
I forget the guys name he's another um
he's another corporate Democrat
apologist I forget his name but he was
another prominent person who thought
this was real the hashtag resistance was
all over this thinking it was real some
of them even after it was pointed out
like hey man look this was actually this
is a joke you know what they did they
were like oh yeah no I know I was just a
play playing into the joke and saying
like oh my god see it's real guys I
guess me D continuing the joke that's
when you know you're really [ __ ]
embarrassed I'm not even gonna admit
that I was duped by the joke I'm gonna
go to be fair to Eric garland he was
like okay you got me but there were
other people who tweeted it out like it
was real with you know they said their
own thing like wow look at what
pixelated bow fan in the book and then
you know when they were people like
that's fake they were like oh yeah no ID
yeah I know I was I was I was joking too
[Music]
but look this and what I wanted to
discuss this for it's obviously
hilarious which is one of the reasons
why we're discussing it but also there's
a genuine problem here man and that
problem is look everybody on the left
even if you're not a fan of Obama we
used to say to people on the right you
have to not be idiots because what's
happening is you're willing to believe
anything negative about Obama simply by
virtue of the fact that it's a negative
thing about Obama
which is why you
had an unconscionable percentage of
people in the Republican Party I think
it was like 50% of people who were like
yeah I don't think he was born in
America I think he was born in Kenya or
you know his birth certificate from
around here
you know he's foreign you know a
ridiculous percentage of people in the
Republican Party thought that Obama was
a Marxist you know it's it's stories
like that and a large percentage of
people believing it like there was I
think it was half the Republican Party
thought that acorn stole the election
for Obama in 2012 when it was against
Mitt Romney when acorn already hadn't
existed for years so there was the acorn
scandal the mucked up scandal with James
O'Keefe Democrats and Republicans
shivved acorn in the side eliminated it
got rid of it as a result of that hack
job done by James O'Keefe but then when
the next election rolled around
Republicans 50% of them still blamed
acorn for Mitt Romney losing they
thought acorn stole the election for
Obama and everybody on the Left looked
at everybody on the right and said Wow
an embarrassing percentage of you are
willing to believe [ __ ] anything as
long as it portrays Obama in a negative
light well guess what that is exactly
what we're dealing with here now again I
get it Trump's an idiot he's innate
everybody knows he's an idiot any
reasonable person knows he's an idiot
he honestly does not he's not able to
follow complex thoughts he
unquestionably has a low IQ he tweets
things like you know I'm like a really
smart person and a very stable genius he
did that this weekend he did that he did
that this weekend that's not just Oh a
tweet in 2009 no now it just happened
you know who says that's somebody who's
not a very stable genius he imagined
Stephen Hawking saying I'm a very stable
genius I'm a very stable you know I'm
like a really smart person never what an
actual really smart person say that cuz
you know real gangsta-ass you know what
don't flex nuts cuz real gangsta-ass
know they got him trumps like I'm great
don't you got im
right but the point is we all know he's
stupid but this it should have been
obvious to you that this was a joke all
it just requires a little bit of
skepticism like even lesser than your
average amount of skepticism and you
would go oh this is obviously a joke
this is hyperbolic this is absurdist and
it's like that on purpose
so don't have Trump derangement syndrome
there is a million and one things to go
after him for that are legitimate but
see that's the problem with so many
people in the hashtag resistance is that
what they do is they take all the things
that are inconsequential or all the
things that are criticisms that are weak
and mealy-mouthed and they go all in on
those criticisms and they don't attack
them on the most substantive points and
honestly one of the main reasons for
that is to learn the more substantive
points requires learning requires
reading the news figuring out what's
actually going on in the country you
know how are you how are you gonna
critique Trump for his one of his first
actions as president being raising taxes
on the middle class which is what he did
they got rid of a tax break for
first-time homebuyers
how can you critique Trump on raising
taxes on the middle class on day one
unless you know he raised taxes on the
middle class on day one how are you
gonna critique Trump for doing a
military raid his first military act as
president killed a young American girl
in a botched raid how are you gonna
criticize him for that if you don't know
that he did that how are you gonna
criticize Trump for increasing drone
strikes four hundred and thirty two
percent if you don't know that he
increased drone strikes by four hundred
and thirty two percent how are you gonna
criticize him for appointing what five
six top Goldman Sachs officials to his
administration who wrote his [ __ ] tax
plan if you don't know that that's what
he did how are you gonna criticize him
for going going back completely on his
promise to get rid of the
carried interest loophole which is a
special giveaway to hedge funds special
giveaway to Wall Street how are you
gonna critique him for going back on his
word to get rid of that if you don't
know that he did that so all the actual
work to attack Trump the escalation with
Iran
you know the arming of Syrian rebels
which are linked to al-qaeda how are you
gonna criticize him for that if you're
not reading about that learning about
that and knowing the real ways to attack
them trust policies are standard
establishment Republican and we all know
standard establishment Republican is as
bad as it gets so you can criticize them
on policy you can even criticize them on
some non policy stuff but when it gets
to this point now what you're doing is
you're destroying your own credibility
and that's why this is an important
story is that you can't wait to dunk on
Trump so you're willing to take anything
to do it and in the process of that it's
always the low-hanging fruit it's always
he must be a Manchurian Candidate he
must be Vladimir Putin's puppet ah he's
unfit for office because he's mentally
unstable now there is an argument for
that but you have to not rely on just
your gut or just what it looks like to
you you have to have an argument that's
more powerful than that then I don't
know look at him look at him so you're
not point is all you're doing is
sniffing your own farts in your own
liberal bubble if every point you make
against Trump is only something that's
gonna make people who already agree with
you not along and that's the case if
you're doing this guerrilla channel
[ __ ] and you fell for it is that we
are you're already predisposed to hating
everything about them so you look around
you go this is real right and then
everybody in you're sick of Fanta
bubbles like yeah this is real
hashtag Hillary 2020 those are the kinds
of people who fall for this [ __ ] those
are the kinds of people who fall for
this [ __ ] we're never had anything to do
with policy if Donald Trump you know
came out and we're going to
a story on this later if Donald Trump
said live we're gonna do Medicare for
all and he actually started fighting for
it I know that wouldn't happen and again
we'll get to a story that's similar to
that later
but these are the same people who got
Medicare for also stupid
what so other words they don't believe
anything they don't actually believe
anything they're just in the politics
into politics for the tribalism and for
the I'm on Team Blue yay you're on Team
red boo
our side is good your side is bad see
your side so stupid that he wanted the
gorilla Channel
that's real I'm a serious thinker just a
little bit of skepticism you wouldn't
went yeah something's off with that so
it's just embarrassing this is just
embarrassing that so many people fell
for it when the guy he wasn't even
trying to do people he was making it so
over the top on purpose that you would
go oh it's funny joke but people who
despise Trump so much they were just
like that must be real and then the
final point of this is and then they go
ahead and then they do this and then
what's the effect the effect is people
go fake news see here's the fake news
Trump was talking about people say
anything anti Trump and then it's
believed and then it's spread and it
goes viral so the media and in corporate
Democrats are working overtime to try to
prove Trump right and that's why this
should really upset you is because the
way you win is to make good arguments
and hammer away not make really shitty
arguments in your insular bubble and
hammer away because then you become
unbearable to people on the fence they
go yeah I would have been with you but
holy [ __ ] you're unscrupulous and you
don't give a [ __ ] about the truth so how
am I supposed to be with you so I'm I do
these segments as a warning pump your
[ __ ] brakes and use your
mind don't just be reactionary idiots
because that's the thing that we're
against and we're supposed to be
consistently against we were against
them under Obama and it was and I'm fine
with criticizing Obama of course I've
criticized him very strongly but the
things I defended him from was when
idiots were saying he's a Marxist he's a
Kenyan he's a Manchurian Candidate but
now that's the same kind of thing you
see going on in corporate democrat
circles and corporate democrat apologist
circles and it's really sad
what's up you willy wonka [ __ ] I
don't know what that means and neither
does corn but I said you know what I've
seen a lot of mal recently well
everybody's clowning the father from
Willy Wonka or it was at his grandfather
or some [ __ ] the dude who's like in the
bed the whole time um no I don't know
what you're talking about
oh well sold Willy Wonka he he like the
father or grandfather is like in the bed
on bed rest for dumb along and then
Willy Wonka comes to the house with the
goat like with the chocolate bar
whatever it gets the golden ticket and
then his grandfather whatever who
supposedly had been on bed rest for like
27 million years all of a sudden sees
that he wins like the prize to go to
this crazy chocolate [ __ ] and he like
jumps outta bed and starts like dancing
and going nuts and everybody's like you
know this [ __ ] is he's been good
old uh my line to get disability like
supposedly the mom is like a housewife
and like the son takes care of him and
all of a sudden he's like he won the
lotto and his grandfather's just like
well bet I'm good that story kind of
reminded me of my grandma on my excuse
me on my dad's side she she had like she
was really smart but she had like
serious mental issues she was manic
depressive son like she'd go through
these phases where she would be like
super almost like she did like a
shitload of coke and she'd be like super
awake and like figuring [ __ ] out and
working and but then she'd go through
the Depression phases to where she would
don't want to talk to anybody don't want
to see anybody don't want to go anywhere
don't want to eat anything and she had
like serious issues but she like bipolar
or was it just like yeah a polar manic
depressives all those things and so like
by the end of her towards the end of her
life though like she spent the last like
30 years of her life just like in her
apartment just like reading [ __ ] and
like watching [ __ ] on TV but like I
remember looking at up and like looking
at her medic her med her meds it was
like she had like every [ __ ] medicine
Under the Sun
for like [ __ ] anti-anxiety [ __ ]
antidepressant [ __ ] antipsychotic [ __ ]
it was like all that stuff it's crazy
how they give all that [ __ ] to old
people like I think I had a not a
grandmother but I think I had an aunt
who had all that [ __ ] too yeah it's like
you're giving [ __ ] 15 plus different
medicines to these people who don't even
remember like like some basic [ __ ] and
you think they're gonna remember to take
two of those and one of those and then
that yeah it's not good but when I get
that old I'm having those [ __ ] pills
hell yeah that's you
well I'm just thinking about that right
now like how the [ __ ] do they remember
like like that they didn't take that
pill right no they don't they do I don't
think I don't think my grandma did of
course not if anyway she would like call
my my dad and be like buck I need you to
get me whatever fill-in-the-blank and
let you be some [ __ ] like from the
kitchen and that [ __ ] is like 20 feet
away from her and he'd be like get up
and get it yourself you'd be like I
can't do it but she could do it like she
didn't do it she would just be like I
can't do this or that it's like no you
could do it you just don't want to do it
and he was right she actually could like
you could like Hatcher you walk in you
could just catch her like walking around
[ __ ] walking actually before we do
anything else we got to do we have a new
tradition on Kyle and corn we do a poll
every time we do a thing oh yeah
so I got a poll for today but I wanted
to talk to you about what we put in the
poll first because there's four options
and we got to whittle it down okay we're
gonna do best soda that's what we're
gonna do but we need to figure out which
four go in there so I think cream sodas
gotta be on there okay so we're gonna we
have we have no choice but to do coke
right and push coke slash Pepsi right we
have to put that in the [ __ ] right or do
we not I don't know is why I'm asking
you this is why I wanted to talk about
it I feel like we have to like if you
don't want to like our own poll for
[ __ ] Coke or Pepsi you want to do all
we should do that so we got to do two
polls then because you say Pepsi right
I'm a Pepsi I like better
imma call right let's do that one first
we'll just do that one and then I wanted
to get to
I was thinking like if I had to pick my
favorite soda mm-hmm once saw one last
soda to drink right man I had to pick
one last soda to drink that's a hard one
for me I think it's a tough one because
I try to I try to decide that when I buy
a soda in the supermarket I'm like what
do I want to drink for the rest of my
life type of [ __ ] it's a genius way to
think about it no but I think I know
what I would pick I do I think I'd go
with dr. pepper I love the one that's
got to be in there yeah yeah I don't
know why but I love it I think I have
one too randomly what it's the cherry
7up oh that [ __ ] if you put it in a
glass it's just like some ice cubes yeah
what okay I got to ask you this one cuz
I want to see your reaction to this one
what do you think of vanilla coke I'm a
big fan I'm a big fan too in it's weird
because they sell it in the supermarket
in cans yeah but they don't sell it in
like a two-liter bottle bottle or
anything like that I wonder if that
[ __ ] up like the ingredients or some
[ __ ] like but I wonder how much of that
they sell have you ever had cherry 7up
cherry 7up - it is delicious
didn't I just say that should know you
said cherry coke oh did I say Terry
Colby cherry separately my cherry 7up
okay yeah both of them are delicious
though cherry coke and cherries banging
throughout yeah my bad I meant cherry
seven red cherry 7up okay yeah now
they're both see this is what I'm saying
this why it's so hard to even make this
poll so okay 7up is a [ __ ] that's a
banger like okay that I love Terry seven
first things first we're gonna do the
traditional just Coke or Pepsi okay
because we we should have an it's I find
it fascinating that you and I are on
separate sides of this one I think
perhaps I think you're you're following
your base is more Pepsi drinkers as my
bowl I mean I got like like obscure like
I don't I don't want to do Pepsi I mean
coke of all the polls though we've done
like what four polls I think the people
who only disagree with me on one so like
the trend is but then again there's no
way they would know
like what I would think of this without
me talking about it true so all right
let's let's find out so first we're
gonna do coke coke versus Pepsi yeah I
like I just I think Pepsi has like a
better taste to it but don't get me
wrong there's nothing there's nothing
bad about like an ice-cold coca-cola -
yeah I love like like Mexico they use
like real sugar as opposed to here and I
heard it yeah yeah I heard that
I don't know if they mean tasting or
health-wise but I heard it's better that
could also be on some type of [ __ ] that
we talked about before or it's like
since we don't have it the rumor just
goes around that that [ __ ] is better you
know like yeah well Pepsi commercial on
my TV right now that's a sign that might
be a sign remember they came out with
all these different they came out like
Pepsi Max and like Crystal Pepsi I don't
even know if I ever had that remember
that Crystal Pepsi no what the [ __ ] was
that it was some [ __ ] that they sold in
like the 90s and then they discontinued
it they made like a big thing of it and
then it didn't do well it's like the
arch deluxe with McDonald's they were
like doing the arch deluxe like this is
the next [ __ ] I use the next Big Mac
[ __ ] like everybody's supposed to love
this and they discontinued it okay I
poked the first Polar's which is better
I put coca-cola Pepsi we're gonna do
length because for the show we're gonna
do an hour well good enough that's the
thing is that we get enough in an hour
like we get plenty of votes in an hour
yeah and that's an easy one so even if
you you're against our [ __ ] polls you
gotta have a favourite in that [ __ ] oh
you have to have - okay but now we have
to whittle down the best soda period so
okay we're agreeing then we're gonna put
dr. pepper on the list and we're
agreeing we're gonna put cherry 7up on
the list obviously so those do there's
only four choices that we get though so
what do we put for the other two because
that's hard because that's why I think
you got a cross off root beer because I
feel like dr. pepper is in that same
category yeah and you gotta cross off
Coke and Pepsi - for the best so like
we're asking Coke and Pepsi in a
separate poll but we're not gonna put
that in the best cuz who really thinks
that one of those is the best
yeah like the better I think I got one
like for the list what are soda I was
just gonna say like orange orange I want
to do like orange / grape
but is that like is that like almost
cheating cuz it's like that's two-in-one
like that like it's not two-in-one but I
think it's different enough that I'm
just thinking about myself here because
I don't like grape at all like so if I
saw that on your so Orange slash grape
you'd be like I'm not gonna click that
sound like great yeah cuz I don't want
it I don't want to give my vote towards
great you just hit me on another level
right there alright so then we gotta go
cherry 7up Dr Pepper orange soda and
cream soda
are we missing anything we can if we
were missing something we got to kick
something off the list no hard to kick
you off the list of that list that's a
good-ass lewis like it was one time I
had I had strawberry soda but I'm not
gonna add that on the list because it's
so rare yeah you know like I think it
was like a strawberry crush and that
[ __ ] was bang that sounds good but you
could you have like multiple glasses of
that like could you refill you know you
can't you can't have multiple you can
only have like one aren't soda I think
you could refill your drink the whole
night if you're eating pizza or Chinese
food or some [ __ ] cream soda same thing
there was a pizzeria when I was a kid
that we used to go to they had the best
fountain orange soda it was like they
put crystal meth in it or something he
was just so delicious I could just drink
that fountain orange soda all day
there's something meals that you just
need a [ __ ] call that soda with you
know like even if even if you're
allergic and you like died from soda if
you have it three times in your life you
have to have it you have it so okay so
what are is that what we're doing we're
doing dr. pepper cherry 7up orange and
cream or do you want to axe cream and
put something else because even though
I'm not I wouldn't pick cream I see how
that could go on that list yeah I'm not
against it going on the list because I
feel like a lot of people might be like
I'm picking cream soda
I feel like root beer is the father of
cream soda and sort of would get cited
if you didn't put room so the kind of
cakes root beers ass though I really do
I think cream soda kind of kicks root
beers ass it does
I think there's your siblings mediocre
that's what I like I've only ordered a
root beer maybe like four times in my
life because there's no G of soda game
though it is it is OG it is OG but
that's
you can that's like picking like who's
the best golfer ever and then somebody's
like [ __ ] Gene Sarazen it's like that
dude's been dead since 1936 yeah if I
could say that he hasn't been dead that
long but you got my point like yeah yeah
yeah yeah they pick a dude from like
1943 yeah it's like you're not no stop
it's either jack or tiger pick one oh
you don't do that yeah true mm-hmm I
like that list I'm trying to think if
there's anything we're missing out or
like we're not sold on cream soda like
there's something we might yeah cream
soda is it's there but it's not missing
anything I don't know those are the four
that I would look at if I'm looking at
the shelf I'm confident I'll lock them
that answer oh I already have the
preliminary results for the Coke versus
Pepsi but I'm not gonna spoil it back
Abbi I'm not gonna spoil it yet because
what I'll do is I'll come back at the
end of these polls and then we'll give
the answer trying to run through the
trying to run through like the soda
aisle right now yeah those is a good
okay so now we go from which it I did
The Witches better Paul Coke or Pepsi no
I'm now I'm I just typed the best soda
and here we go oh let me do this I'm
watching uh Ellen DeGeneres's new show
she has a new show yeah it's um they
like just do all these crazy games like
the game is show the show is called game
of games and literally every contestant
is like someone who is from her audience
like x 500 million on crack oh [ __ ] so
you ever like seen a highlight of her
show or her show and like she calls an
audience member up to the front yes I
have and they do and it's just like it's
yeah and they're like just like running
in place jumping it down and they can't
put a sentence together and just
clapping their hands and smiling and
that's what every contestant on this
show is what games are they play though
do they play games that are kind of
interesting and that you
you want to watch it or is it just
stupid yeah it's it's pretty fun like
they stand on this like circle that
drops you into this thing and like you
answer a question but I'm a little tight
at the contestants because it's it's
like they're too excited they're too
excited it's fake it's like fake it's
really fake and then right and then you
look at Ellen and she I've said this
before she doesn't look like she's happy
doing what she's doing she might not be
I mean she's been doing like the very
lowbrow kind of talk shows for a while I
mean she has spoken about serious issues
which probably she's happy when she does
that but most of the time she's you know
being silly I feel that way about Fallon
because Fallon does that [ __ ] all the
time
yeah and then everybody starts [ __ ]
on him like hey [ __ ] you had donald
trump on your show and pet it in like
stop like Ellen's all over Hillary yeah
but she's just like she'll give away
like ten thousand dollars or some [ __ ]
and she's like hands over the check like
here [ __ ] here seems tight about
it okay so I so let's um so I was
talking today I did like a live stream
today all night talking [ __ ] and one of
the things I was talking about was like
starting the first I'm on my diet again
you know like I'm on my diner new me
exactly and I'm working out so but I
like I've already been like tempted by
food I shouldn't eat and stuff of course
yeah when you were you text me about
Wendy's I was like the whole Wendy's
yeah so but I realized like I go back
and forth I go back and forth between
wanting to be like on some of the rock
[ __ ] like yeah I get up and go to the
gym and I'm on point versus wanting to
be on some demotivational like don't be
yourself yes I don't care about any of
this [ __ ] you me let me eat whatever I
want do whatever I want so I decided
today I went I got the top ten
motivational quotes from brainy quote
it's like a website that does quote yeah
I got the list of the top ten I want and
what all-time that's what they say it's
me no it's not there's no like you can't
objectively measure it
you know they just made a list though we
think these are the top ten so I want to
do those and I got the top ten D
motivational quotes and I wanted to go
through them and then we're gonna
determine which ones make more sense I
feel like the number one D motivational
quotes should just be nah just chill
like what's or whatever someone says
because I'd agree with that I mean yeah
that makes sense you should you know
cycle workouts like now just to add
exactly like I get that all right so I
think I think a lot of these
motivational ones are corny I just kind
of skimmed through it before fight it
like listen to this one this is
motivational or D motivational this is
the motivational okay always do your
best what you plant now you will harvest
later yeah I mean just basic like you'll
see that on a third grade teachers wall
or some [ __ ] but like like I've seen
motivational quotes and I'm like oh [ __ ]
I like that [ __ ] like there was one of
my favorite ones was from Martin Luther
King he said the time is always right to
do what's right
oh sure it is the time is always right
to do what's right you know and that
could give you like a little burst of
like yeah let's [ __ ] do it you know
yeah but then there are other
motivational quotes they're just like so
corny that you're like I don't want to
be motivational now because you just hit
me with some corny [ __ ] like that one
always do your what like that's just a
given yeah like always do your best will
you plant now you will harvest later I
think well what about like what if I
want some [ __ ] gains now they'll tell
me what I plant now I'm gonna harvest
later and I want to wait for the [ __ ]
harvest you know what I mean you got to
hit me with some [ __ ] that makes me feel
it more yeah that one doesn't have like
a lot of oomph to it okay here's one
that's even worse because it just drags
on infuse your life with action don't
wait for it to happen make it happen
make your own future make your own hope
make your own love and whatever your
beliefs honor your Creator not by
passively waiting for grace to come down
from upon high but by doing what you can
to make grace happen yourself right now
God to him
yeah like shut the [ __ ] up okay that I'm
about to get off my diet reading these
that one was only that one was
definitely a motivational speaker at an
event who said the first part of that
[ __ ] and the audience didn't start
clapping yeah you just kept going yeah
that was actually Bradley Whitford who's
an actor why the [ __ ] is he even on this
list failure what do you say
he said you scroll up he definitely said
like one sentence the audience was like
that's it that's okay yeah that's a good
boy infuse your life with action people
were like I don't know what is it
don't don't wait for it to happen make
it happen okay the commercial for the
casinos there's a commercial in New York
for the casinos really do this they sing
that song oh that's funny make your own
future make your own hope okay that's so
bad I'm gonna back was definitely like
yeah I'm leaving in the demotivational
opinion of ones and we haven't even
gotten to him yet the next one is
failure will never overtake me if my
determination to succeed is strong
enough that one's okay yeah no they're
like just Kimmy do you know though
there's one that was on like a shirt
when I was when I saw when I was younger
I thought it was [ __ ] brilliant well
it was a workout thing it was like and
he was like pain is weakness leaving the
body or something like yeah I've heard
that I was like oh I like that I like
that one yeah it sounds like I could see
that like you're in pain working out but
that's like that's your weakness leaving
it's like okay I can [ __ ] with that
remember those um like life is good
what's up [ __ ] I'll let you boy so as
everybody knows I still don't know what
the [ __ ] I'm doing with these live
streams um ooh
there I am I heard myself in my ears I
have one person watching 26 people
watching gimme gimme gimme come on more
where y'all at
Kyle lookin like a snack wrong fake news
110 people watching can we get to a
thousand in the middle of the day we
about to find out [ __ ]
okay so let's try to figure out how did
I do this last time I think the super
chests just pop up right I mean so I'm
gonna take some super shots obviously in
a second if I could figure out what the
[ __ ] I'm doing again so somebody told me
after the fact last time that apparently
the $2 super chats don't pop up in like
the super chat area where you can read
the super chats so like you got to kind
of keep your eye out for the $2 Super
chats so I apparently I missed some
questions last time I still don't know
what the [ __ ] I'm doing so bear with me
I apologize if I miss people's questions
last time and I apologize in advance if
I miss any questions this time but
before we get in to the the super chat
stuff and as I'm talking to you I will
continue to click through to try to see
what the dealio is with the super shots
I don't remember when I click last time
but I do have a couple things I want to
talk about apart from that apart from
answering all y'all questions so um
somebody said Kyle DP is dead okay let
me touch on that for a little bit first
boom-shaka-laka have my money I will
take that $5 dishonest Abe thank you
drunken peasants yeah drunken peasants
is gone and went under yeah
it makes it sound like it went bankrupt
or something it didn't go bankrupt but
drunken peasants is TJ Kirk's podcast
apparently he's starting a new one soon
though which I look forward to checking
out I like drunken peasants I went on
drunken peasants probably three or four
times of course we had the debate on
drunken peasants against razörfist who
got razor fisted but all my appearances
on drunken peasants I liked I was a fan
of the show but you know the first
thought I had when that when TJ
announced that that's gone is like wow
and we take things for granted you know
what I mean like we take things for
granted like when it's happening you
just think like what do you mean this is
just gonna keep happening I don't
understand why like it's something that
exists and it's just it's not gonna stop
existing but then it stops existing and
you're like oh [ __ ] when that was
happening maybe I could have you know I
don't know cherished it a little more
and I think that might be something with
human nature that's just how human
nature is you just start taking [ __ ] for
granted so it's a shame but I'm sure TJ
will his new podcast I'm sure will be
good I don't know all the details of the
story but there may have been issues
behind the scenes as happens with
anything where human beings are involved
and there's multiple different
viewpoints and a dispersion of
responsibilities but yeah I'm sure TJ
will have a good new podcast and we will
all miss DP so our IP DP by the way how
weird is this the first video that pops
up on my thing is Kyle debates
conservative youtuber razörfist on
drunken peasants isn't that weird like
we're talk I'm talking about I mentioned
that we're talking about drunken
peasants and then it's just that's the
first recommended video Wow
this [ __ ] is getting kind of creepy okay
so while I still don't know what the
[ __ ] is going on with the super chats
and I probably won't be able to
figure it out this time cuz I'm a
dumbass oh there we go live control room
it popped up then now there we go this
is where I was last time so maybe I'll
get a good I'll get a good sense over
yeah if I happen to get some super chef
but so here's what I wanted to talk
about apart from answering your lovely
people's questions where's my little I
made a little tiny list here oh [ __ ] you
I clicked on the wrong thing here it is
okay so I was gonna tell this story on
air but I didn't have time
Holaday conversations with the family
listen I try man people get the wrong
impression of me from what I do of like
yeah I bet Kyle's the one that sits
around at Thanksgiving dinner or
Christmas dinner or whatever and he's
the one that brings up politics no [ __ ]
I don't bring it up at all I don't want
to talk about it I don't want to hear
about it for a variety of reasons but I
won't I won't really get into the
reasons but oftentimes it's brought up
to me family members will start talking
to me about it and then I can't help
myself because it's like look I'm I'm
happy you not talking about it but if
you bring up something and it's just
like ridiculous then what am i what am I
gonna do sometimes it is not to take it
and I'm not alone yeah sure whatever
I'm sure you're right yeah bama's birth
certificate ever but sometimes I can't
help myself so the conversation last
time and the reason why I'm bringing
this up is because it doesn't fit in
that regular category of like either
just totally dismiss it or not along or
zone out a family member had brought up
in the context of a conversation about
taxes a few points that should be
rebutted so first of all there's this
theory that he has which is just totally
made up that it's the Democrats are the
reason why the taxes aren't permanent on
people making $75,000 a year or less
what no so Republicans have a majority
[ __ ] everywhere and they use
reconciliation to get it through the
Senate so they just needed 50
votes to get it through the Senate so in
the house it's a ridiculous lead that
they have so they can put whatever the
[ __ ] they wanted in the bill they didn't
put permanent tax cuts for people making
$75,000 a year or less cuz they don't
want to put it in there they don't agree
with that um
and that should be obvious but no we
came up with this cockamamie theory of
like it's cuz the Democrats you know
they're the ones who wanted to to put
the sunset provision on that no the
Democrats wanted neither part of the
bill the tax cuts for the corporations
and the rich because none of the
Democrats voted for it
and the tax cuts for the middle class in
the way that they did it but again it
there's a sunset provision on it after
ten years that goes away and if anything
that should be permanent and there
should be temporary cuts for the rich
and corporations well there really
should be none but it's a Republican
bill so I get it that they're gonna put
it in there but point is a family member
just made it up like oh yeah no it's
because the Democrats that the $75,000 a
year or less that those tax cuts aren't
permanent and it's like how do you how
do you take yourself seriously when you
just come up with these theories that
are based on absolutely nothing like oh
yeah this is how I'm going to
rationalize it that the Republicans are
the party of regular people is that look
they gave a tax cuts in middle class
people but oh there's a sunset provision
but the ones for the rich are permanent
but so I can't blame the Republicans for
doing what they did so I'm just gonna
say it's because of the Democrats that
they didn't make those tax cuts
permanent so that just count under my
skin because it's like it's so
delusional it's like you're he's trying
so hard to convince himself like you
know this is what's going on the
Republicans are looking out for for
regular people
then as the conversation moved along he
let me know what he really thinks about
Texas and he says oh it should just be a
flat tax of 20% flat income tax rate of
20% so this is one of those things where
I feel like at face value
people might look at it and go yeah
that's reasonable why not a flat tax of
20% I mean it seemed it's it's simple
its straightforward it's a tax rate that
people by and large can handle so why
not just the flat tax of 20% across the
board and then we're done
and you know my response to him and this
is why I wanted to discuss this so you
guys know what to say if somebody brings
us up to you is a 20 percent flat tax
what that ends up being is a gigantic
tax cut on the rich and a gigantic tax
increase on the poor so we already have
historic levels of income inequality and
this is his solution like yeah just do a
flat tax 20% but that will make income
inequality even worse because I Got News
for you if somebody makes twenty five
thousand dollars a year they can't
afford to pay twenty percent of their
money in taxes but if somebody makes
eight million dollars a year not only
can they afford to pay twenty percent
taxes they should be paying a much
higher tax rate than that so this is one
of those things where it kind of sounds
good in theory like Oh 20 percent flat
tax so simple but in reality it's a
horrendous idea because we have record
income inequality right now it would
exacerbate it it would make it much
worse and it's a giant tax increase on
the poor and a giant tax decrease on the
rich um
and so I brought that up to him and his
response was okay but I'll let then the
first $10,000 is tax free as if that
like ameliorates the whole thing and now
all of a sudden he's making a good point
no because if somebody makes eleven
thousand dollars a year they can't
afford to pay twenty percent of their
money to the government they just can
they just can't so that's not just
that's not a good system because again
you'll have Bill Gates paying twenty
percent in taxes and you'll have this
person make an eleven grand paying
twenty percent taxes they can't afford
to pay it Bill Gates can afford to pay
that and much much more and still be
mega rich if he does that so that was a
little bit of an infuriating
conversation and I just want everybody
to realize there are some ideas that
sound good at face value
but then when you think about it you
realize it's actually a terrible idea
you know it's honestly it's almost like
communism
it sounds great from each according to
his ability to each according to his
need but then it when you implement it
it's actually terrible so and I know
there are people who listen to me who
actually consider themselves Marxist and
they would say I'm being flippant and
I'm not you know arguing against a steel
man argument they would say I'm straw
Manning them and arguing against that
listen no matter how intellectual you
try to make it sound ultimately I think
it doesn't work but in theory on paper
you look at it you go oh that might work
and that might make perfect sense and I
feel very similar with you know like
extreme libertarians and people who are
semi libertarian and they would say yeah
flat tax why not well here's why not
giant tax decrease for the rich who
don't need it giant tax increase on the
poor who do need their money do need to
be able to keep more of their money so
not a good idea of flat tax not a good
idea at all even though it face value
some people might like it now the next
thing that really annoyed me was um we
got into somehow Jeff Bezos came up the
Amazon guy who's now worth like 100
billion dollars and I said to him I
think he was in the context of the flat
tax argument
I said listen nobody should have 100
billion dollars nobody should have 100
billion dollars that's too much wealth
that's too much power and just by virtue
of the fact that he has that money he is
a threat to any form of government I
mean that's a threat to democracy period
and his response was like well but he
earned that money and I'm here to tell
you no he didn't
nobody earned a hundred billion dollars
that doesn't mean anything
so you could say in a market sense he
accumulated a hundred billion dollars
but your market value is not equal to
your human value so we pay people in
accordance with their market value which
means that you have Jeff Bezos with a
hundred billion dollars but you also
have 30 million people in this country
without health care
you know you have half the country
making $30,000 a year or less I know
people who worked three jobs literally
sunup to sundown working like crazy
busting their ass on the hardest workers
I've ever seen and they were in poverty
so this idea of like yeah but you don't
Jeff Bezos just worked really hard so I
don't know you can't what are you gonna
take his money away from him no that's
the point is this isn't a meritocracy so
I'm not taking his money away from him
because the underlying assumption there
is that it's it's his to be taken away
but no if you accumulate a hundred
billion dollars it's not just that you
worked harder than other people it's
that your market value the accumulation
of wealth with your market value perhaps
that's not the way the system should be
created where your market value is your
actual material well-being value so a
hundred billion dollars you literally
can't I mean that would be this is such
a dumb way to explain it but nonetheless
here I go that'd be like he lives 200
years old and spends a billion dollars a
year but that's [ __ ] crazy that's just
absolutely utterly ridiculous and again
at the same time that's happening we
have people who can't afford to keep the
[ __ ] lights on people who are getting
kicked out of their house who work you
know so it's just a the the premise is
flawed when they go yeah but that's his
money you can't what do you mean that's
his money listen right now I think it's
either six people or eight people I
think it's six people the six richest
people in the world have more wealth
than the bottom 50% of the world so six
people more than 3.5 billion people they
didn't just work harder they're products
of a system where there's rigging
there's corruption there's tremendous
wealth passed down from generation to
generation this isn't a meritocracy
period it's not a meritocracy if you
think it's a meritocracy you're
hilariously wrong I mean thing
about in the context of a pizza pie so
you have a pizza that's that can feed
everybody in the world six people walk
in and take more than half the pizza and
leave what remains for you know over six
and a half billion people that's not
they didn't just work harder and if you
think that's the case
you're just factually wrong some of the
hardest people I've ever seen hardest
workers I've ever seen they lived in
poverty so the problem is with the
system the problem is that there's an
assumption that we live in a meritocracy
we do not live in a meritocracy
so you have to craft a system that makes
sense you have to craft a system that
doesn't give people material well-being
solely based on their market value so
anyway that was my response to that I
was gonna get into some other stuff here
but I'm gonna check in on the super
chats real quick skis okay I'm seeing
I'm seeing the money I'm not seeing the
questions wrong wrong so can somebody
send me a question so I see if it pops
up a super chat question so I could see
if it pops up I see the $20 yeah eric s
gave twenty bucks thank Eric thanks Eric
but I don't see questions I guess he
didn't ask a question kolinsky Kirk
20/20 that's funny I love pizza sub Kyle
sup Jacob how you doing man so can
somebody send me a question here real
quick with a super chat so I see if
everything's working all hunky dory I
think it just might be one of those
situations where I'm not getting a lot
of super chats today how many 1378
people I gotta say man not bad for the
middle of the day not bad for the middle
of a Oh Carl okay so Carl sent a
question here let's see in 1992
Clinton's DLC took over DNC and
formalized corporate funding any hope
fixing this in 2018 could a progressive
POTUS easily forced DNC reform that's
good question
um I think we have to force DNC reform
so that they had the reform committee
and now it goes to one person it goes to
another committee and then it comes back
to the reform committee and then the
whole DNC votes on it but they asked for
reforms like the effective elimination
of super-delegates and stuff like that
and we'll see we'll be able to see if
they reformed or if they didn't reform
and if they're serious about this or
they're not serious about this um so and
then we'll judge accordingly how you
want to vote and who you want to support
and all that stuff and that's a giant
factor is how fair is the DNC you can
make this thing okay now I see it's
working because all these questions are
popping up so no way Carl I hope I
answered your question there yes the DNC
started taking corporate money now we're
trying to fight back to make them be
what they should have been all along and
it's a question of whether or not um
they'll actually abide by what the
people want
nelle OS I feel like you should have
stayed on JD kind of feels like it's
being taken over by social justice
warriors okay so that let me let me
address that because of course this was
something that was gigantic on the
internet for understandable reasons I
think jank was put in a no-win position
and then I think subsequently I was put
to knowing position so everybody knows
most of the story there were old blog
posts from the late 90s and early 2000s
that popped up of jank back when he was
a right-winger not that that's an excuse
of course for the for the substance of
what he said but some of the stuff was
tongue-in-cheek there were other blogs
they were probably serious where he had
some odious opinions and stuff and so
basically the staff that JD was like
listen you're one of the faces of this
movement we don't want that because one
of the things he said was you know I
think my reading of this I think it what
he was saying was tongue-in-cheek and he
was poking fun of himself for not being
able to get laid but he said obviously
the genes of women are flawed because
they don't want to reproduce nearly
enough for everybody to get along
peaceably and fruitfully at first when I
read that I didn't think it was
tongue-in-cheek either he was dead
serious and I was like damn that's kind
of like the definition of sexism and
jank was massively sexist but then I
read it over and over and yeah it looks
like he's making fun of himself for not
being able to get laid but anyway the
staff at JD said sorry we don't want to
have a leader of our
movement who's who said things like that
at any point because then you're feeding
into the narrative of the Bernie bro and
you're gonna make it so people dismiss
us and say yeah we were right about
these guys all along they had they have
one their leaders one of the phases of
the movement was a sexist or of course
the Hillary people would say probably is
a sexist even though that's nowhere near
true of course shanks not sexist so
that's what they said
so jank stepped down and said listen um
I don't want to hurt any of the
candidates so I will willingly step down
but then when he was stepping down on
the way out the door they kind of kicked
him in the kicked him in the ass and
the hill wrote an article expressing
shock and awe at Trump's policies in
regards to Russia now you know everybody
is aware of the current climate when it
comes to trump and Russia and the
narrative coming out of the mainstream
media and the focus from the Democrats I
mean I think it's fair to say that this
is now the Democrats main focus like
this is what they talk the most about
corporate Democrats talk the most about
this issue you know maybe this mixed in
with how Trump is just so unhinged so
it's almost like they make a point to
not hammer away on the policies which is
wild because Trump is just in terms of
his actual policies in many ways he is
MIT Romney he is an establishment
Republican extraordinaire pact his
administration full of goldman sachs cut
taxes for corporations and the rich you
know deregulated everything in sight you
name the destructive right-wing policy
endless war he's doing all that stuff
but instead of talking about you know
that stuff and instead of the democrats
selling a different vision medicare for
all free college living wage and the
wars they don't talk about that stuff
why they don't necessarily agree with
all those policies so what do you do
when that's the case you go ahh unhinged
unfit for office and you say stuff like
is Vladimir Putin's puppet that's what
he is
well when the people at the hills
decided to look into the policy angle of
the Trump Russia scandal here's what
they found in surprise Trump maintains
many Obama era Russia policies the Trump
administration has quietly maintained in
Obama era approach to countering
aggression from Moscow even as the
president's dismissal of Russian
meddling in the election and warm words
towards that country's leader have
scandalized Washington
it approved the largest commercial sale
of lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine
since 2014
a move that earned praise from both
sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill and
implemented sanctions targeting people
in Russia for human rights abuses under
US law some on look were on lookers
fretted the president might try to evade
okay let me pause so they're actually
they're not even right what they're
saying is oh he continued Obama era
policies that's not true in fact he's
more hawkish than Obama Obama refused to
arm people in Ukraine because he said
listen that's a direct escalation
towards World War three
you're gonna arm people in Ukraine who
are fighting Russians well then that's
you know this is just cold war 2.0
turning into a slightly hot war because
that's a proxy war that's a proxy war
that's the West and the u.s. in Ukraine
by the way a lot of the people who are
actively fighting the Russians there are
neo-nazis that's not an exaggeration but
Obama said no we're not gonna arm these
rebels because number one many of them
were [ __ ] neo-nazis and number two do
we really want to do World War three
over [ __ ] Crimea that's what Obama
said I'm not gonna arm him and he caught
a lot of [ __ ] from neo-cons and the deep
state and the establishment when he said
that Trump is like okay I don't care
tremendous believe me
so Trump is arming Ukrainians who are
fighting Russians that is a giant
escalation now if the resistance was
being competent they would say no don't
do that don't arm these people many of
them are neo-nazis don't arm these
people you want it [ __ ] World War
threes that what you want but no because
the narrative is Donald Trump is
Vladimir Putin's puppet foreign agent is
running the US government
the resistance is nowhere to be found
and I just told you bipartisan praise
what do I always warn you about
bipartisanship in Washington run for the
hills when you hear bipartisanship
coming out of Washington because the
only time they agree is to screw you and
to do more war so what was the last
bipartisan deal we had to deregulate
Wall Street in the big banks Joe Manchin
and a bunch of other Blue Dog Democrats
agreed with Republicans hey let's
deregulate the banks more that was the
last bipartisan deal coming out of
Washington now you have bipartisan
praise of arming Ukrainians to fight
against Russians it's amazing how it
doesn't matter how hawkish she gets
doesn't matter how right-wing he gets in
his policies the resistance arguments
why don't you go further right-wing oh
that is a recipe for disaster
and then again so we implemented
sanctions and he signed the sanctions
bill that Congress passed more sanctions
on Russia he was like fine I'll sign it
even though I don't want to he said I
don't want to but he signed it and then
the argument became I'm not kidding
about this people would be like but he
hesitated in implementing them so that
proves he's Putin's puppet are you
[ __ ] kidding that's your argument
sure he's escalating
but he didn't do it and they he did it
in a timely fashion or he didn't do it
in a timely fashion he escalated but it
took him a little longer than I expected
so therefore he's his puppet this is the
argument there mate I'm not kidding
about this people tweeted me about this
like Kyle so naive sure he increased
sanctions but it took him a little while
yeah all right so let's continue I'll
give you more information it increased
the budget for the European deterrence
initiative an effort begun under former
President Obama to bolster allies
defenses in response to Russian
aggression and deployed US soldiers to
Poland as part of a majority u.s. NATO
task force
and it is poised to announce more
sanctions against Russia faced with a
January 29 deadline to name targets
under a separate law grudgingly signed
by President Trump over the summer even
some obama officials call the approach
mainstream quote the policy has been in
continuity with the Obama administration
post 2014 after the Russian invasion of
Ukraine
said Daniel freed who under Obama served
as the State Department's sanctions
coordinator I think the actual policies
on the ground have been pretty good said
freed who also worked as a senior
official on Russia issues during the
Bush administration but those policies
have been obscured by the president's
unusually warmer rhetoric
toward the Kremlin so that that's it
right there that explains it so because
Trump dared to say hey wouldn't it be
nice if we got along with Russia because
he dared to say that people are
unbelievable
[ __ ] Putin's puppet over here who
doesn't want to like escalate to World
War 3 I think he's been compromised I
think he's a Manchurian Candidate
because of his rhetoric Democrats lose
their [ __ ] and they go see Putin's
puppet meanwhile all of his policies
they say it's the same as Obama's
they're wrong it's more hawkish than
Obama he is being more hawkish than
Obama because he armed Ukrainians and I
just told you increase sanctions
increase the budget for the European
deterrence initiative so in other words
all of trumps rhetoric about hey we need
to move away from NATO or reform NATO
because we pay too much and they should
pay more and all that stuff
nonsense what he's actually increasing
he's increasing funding for it
so let me explain you what's happening
this is Trump going yeah I don't care
whatever the establishment wants to do
you do in terms of Russia
I don't care and in his mind this is him
like disproving the the Democrats who
say he's Putin's puppet but what's the
problem with that the problem is how
would Trump disprove that he's Putin's
puppet by being more aggressive and
being more hawkish and what's crazy is
that even when he acts more hawkish as
he's doing Democrats go nah not hawkish
enough sir oh no so
now the resistance argument is why don't
you go full right-wing and go to
escalate to world war three with Russia
and listen that's the problem and people
have gotten mad at me like why do you
not cover the Russia thing exactly like
the mainstream media it's cuz I don't
agree with them Rachel Maddow did a
segment where she said if Trump removes
NATO troops from Russians border from
Russia's border that proves that
Vladimir Putin has the PP tape of him so
in other words the only way Trump can
prove you wrong that he's not Putin's
puppet is to continually keep us on the
brink of World War 3 don't you see a
problem with that Rachel and by the way
what a weird assumption I mean you want
to talk about Trump derangement syndrome
what a weird assumption if he moves us
away from the brink of war by removing
the NATO soldiers obviously Putin has
dirt on him as opposed to I don't know
maybe Trump doesn't want World War 3
that would be my takeaway oh [ __ ] good
he's moving removing the troops from the
nail from NATO's border so in other
words now even if Trump does the right
policies he's gonna be smeared as well
see told you it's totally soft on Putin
but see that's why I want to ask all the
people who are who pushed this Russia
stuff all day long I want to ask them so
forget all the things I think that you
know this happened or that happened and
he's doing their bidding in Yatta Yatta
put all that stuff aside for just a
minute and you tell me every policy you
favor in regards to Russia
what do you favor in terms of Ukraine do
you want to arm Ukraine what do you
favor in terms of sanctions do you want
a sanction Russia and what sanctions
exactly are appropriate do you want to
keep NATO troops on the border do you
want to increase funding to NATO answer
all those for me and the disgusting
thing is I think the overwhelming
majority of the hashtag-- resistance
would tell would say all those policies
that they prefer it's the right wing
side of those policies escalate further
arm the people in Ukraine and that's
where my core disagreement is with them
I don't agree with that I want to move
away from world war 3 I do want to get
along with Russia because I want to get
along with everybody I don't want to be
buddy-buddy and hold [ __ ] Putin's
hand and frolic in the park and ignore
his human rights abuses of course I
don't want to do that but do I want to
have it
the neutral relationship so we're not
living on the [ __ ] brink of war with
another nuclear-armed power yes that
used to be the Democratic position early
in Obama's time in office that was the
Democratic position remember when Obama
mocked Mitt Romney in 2012 because Mitt
Romney said Russia's the biggest threat
to the United States and Obama said the
1980s called they want their foreign
policy back al Qaeda is the biggest
threat to the US not Russia I want that
I want that kind of Democratic Party
back the one that says no I wanted to
kind of make peace with people who we
don't agree with and who we have issues
with but no now if Trump makes peace
with them she proves the Urim entry in
candidate and you're his puppet and
you're his [ __ ] that's my problem with
this stuff and by the way it's also a
matter of evidence people say Oh a trump
to Russia
Trump Russia trouble what okay where's
your evidence virtually everything they
point to has been retracted by the media
that originally reported it isn't that
funny and then again they screamed about
Russia Russia Russia meanwhile what
happened with Michael Flynn Michael
Flynn is indicted because this
[ __ ] took money from Turkey over
five hundred thousand dollars from
Turkey to push in Washington the idea
that now don't arm the Kurds the courage
don't want armed them to fight Isis even
though that would make sense because
they're the best fighting force in the
region against Isis don't arm them why
because stuff and things
I wouldn't arm them because he got paid
to take that position so there's a real
scandal there's a real turkey scandal
holy [ __ ] turkey is paying for influence
to get whatever policy they want in
Washington there's a foreign power
controlling your government and it
[ __ ] happened that happened um
Ukraine same thing with Ukraine Paul
Manafort and Ukraine Donald Trump in
Saudi Arabia they paid him to what
$250,000 to stay in his hotel why
because they actually spent $250,000 no
they gave $200,000 so that they could
buy weapons they bought favouritism this
is the exact kind of [ __ ] we got mad at
Hillary Clinton about for the Clinton
Foundation bills going around the world
giving shitty speeches getting paid
billions of dollars so that Hillary
Clinton can approve arms deals for
brutal dictatorships what the [ __ ] do
you think's happening with Trump in his
hotels and his businesses around the
world
Saudi Arabia gives him way more money
than they actually spent at his hotels
they shouldn't State his hotels in the
first place there's a conflict of
interest there but they stay there gives
him give him hundreds of thousands of
dollars and then look at that
Trump approves in over a hundred billion
dollar weapons deal Trump opened eight
new businesses in Saudi Arabia during
the campaign so he takes money from a
foreign government Saudi Arabia and does
their bidding and nobody says Saudi
Arabia scandal Trump's a puppet to Saudi
Arabia
well you [ __ ] should because we have
the evidence on that we have the
evidence on Ukraine we have the evidence
on Turkey we have the evidence on Saudi
Arabia we have the evidence on five or
six different countries because Trump
does business with 12 different
countries we have direct evidence of hey
they give you money you do favors for
them using your position of authority
that is a clear violation of the
embodiments clause in the constitution
but no instead of bringing that up what
do you do
Russia even though you've done no favors
for Russia even though you've been more
hawkish and more right-wing with them
Russia well this is why the Democrats
are trying to squandering their chances
to win in 2022 Trump has a chance to win
again at 2020 I know you know come on
it's no bad low approval rating that's
all true but what the [ __ ] do the
Democrats stand for if their only
argument the entire times Russia [ __ ]
Russia unhinged Russia and he's unhinged
your argument of I'm not him was already
tried and how'd that work out so you
need to fight for Medicare for all in
free college and a living wage and
ending the wars and a new New Deal in
legalizing marijuana [ __ ] stand for
something stand for something and one of
those things that you should stand for
is hey let's deescalate with Russia by
the way you want to oppose Trump Russia
good I do too
I'll be the guy actually resisting you
go no no no you want to arm Ukraine bad
idea don't arm Ukraine no no don't
implement more sanctions that's a bad
idea to implement more sanctions no stop
stop
giving more money to NATO troops to keep
him on the border stop stop stop
escalating to World War three if you
want to resist there's a way to resist
resist the actual policies
so there have been four days of severe
unrest in Iran there have been giant
protests that broke out now the reasons
behind them are varied and it's not one
central thing it appears to be a mix of
different things so I've read bankruptcy
of retirement funds is one of the
reasons why people are protesting
inflation so you know economic reasons
corruption is another one even foreign
policy where you know there's chance
about how they don't want the government
to be spending on Yemen or Lebanon they
want the government to take care of the
people of Iran but the last time
something like this happened in Iran was
2009 and back then and he was called the
green movement they were supporting
reformers now they've gone a step
further and they appeared to want the
government toppled so they're against
the hardliners and the Reformers I mean
a sound ronnie is president right now
and he's a reformer but he's part of
this you know they're just viewing the
government as their enemy at the moment
so let me give you some of the things
that they've been chanting this is
fascinating
we don't want an Islamic Republic we
don't want it we don't want it this is
one of their chants they are using Islam
as an excuse to drive people crazy
so another huge part of this protest is
against theocracy the Iran is a young
country and that younger generation
despises the old clerics the grand
ayatollah you know people who've used
religion as a bludgeon over their head
to try to get the people to fall in line
there's a theocratic country a Shia
Islamist country the young people are
like no we're more secular so that's
another chant independence freedom
Iranian Republic another chant
reformists hardliners game is over
another chance so they're against both
we are all Iranians we don't accept
Arabs now somebody who I have a friend
from Iran who says this the
interpretation of this that people are
giving is wrong we only accept Arabs
doesn't mean literal Arabs it's not a
racist chant what they're saying is we
don't accept Islam that's another way of
saying we don't accept Islam because
they view Islam as Arabic and Islam you
know had effectively taken over Iran so
what they're saying is we're all
Iranians so like we're all Persians we
don't accept Islam we want to reject
that we are getting poor and clerics are
driving fancy cars
it's another chant we will die but we
will take Iran back come out to the
streets Iran Ian's shout for your rights
death to Revolutionary Guards death to
the dictator is another one
they set pictures of the Grand Ayatollah
on fire so this is this is real [ __ ]
going down there and by the way here's
probably the most controversial chan
Reza Shah rest in peace Reza Shah was he
was the dictator of Iran
now again again you could say of course
Kurt currently even though there's
elections for who's gonna be President
the Grand Ayatollah is really in control
the Revolutionary Guards are really in
control so it is still you know an
authoritarian situation and they are the
dictators but before that it was the
Shah and the Shah was ousted in the 1979
Islamic Revolution so you have some
protesters who were chanting for a
monarchy back who are chanting for the
secular dictator to come back so it
again it appears to be a mix of things
people are protesting for there's no
central message there's economic stuff
there's you know corruption there's
calls for a secular monarchy to come
back so this is all over the place
now protesters attacked banks and
government buildings and there are even
reports of top government officials
fleeing the country which is a wild side
because that's what happens when people
are going should this government's gonna
collapse there's video shared on social
media that showed the police in Tehran
firing water cannons to try to disperse
demonstrators and at this point at least
12 protesters were killed that's
according to time and I saw that right
before I came on air and social media
sites sites have been shut down
so more popular social media sites which
people used to communicate and this is a
really interesting thing to see because
Iran has been honestly one of the most
stable countries in the region amid the
turmoil everywhere else there they've
been very stable but now you see this
unrest bubbling to the surface now the
Iran deal of course it was Obama and
Kerry and Hassan rouhani and it was
supposed to be something that brought
prosperity back to Iran and you know
made it so that like they the
Republicans love to use this totally
misleading fact about how Obama gave
Iran billions nonsense
they gave Iran back their own money that
we stole from them with sanctions so in
other words hey you don't create a nuke
we have the IAEA come in there and
regulate and and do inspections and make
sure you don't create nuclear weapons
and in return we'll give you back in
your own money so that's what happened
so this was expected to bring prosperity
to everybody which is why it was people
love the Iran deal
um but what's happened is because of
corruption that wealth didn't really
trickle down so it's kind of a similar
situation of what we're seeing in the
West and that there's such extreme
corruption that even in a situation
we're supposed to help the people no
it's like with our recovery here how
corporate profits are now at a record
high but wages haven't budged they
haven't gone up so that's similar thing
there except there they're also
dealing with inflation which makes the
cost of like eggs and milk I think it
went up like to double the price it was
so that's when you get people in the
streets go not only are we not seeing
the benefits we actively win the wrong
direction because we didn't see the
windfall of the Iran deal and also now
the prices of common goods are going up
so they poured out in the streets so
corruption is a big issue but also the
rhetoric from Trump has scared investors
from going into Iran and making deals
with Iran because they're afraid the US
government's gonna come after them say
no you can't do that so this is another
giant problem is that I think there were
like one or two deals oil deals and some
other deals that were made with Iran but
so many other corporations are like
we're not gonna do it we're not gonna
make a deal with them because Trump is
talking about some [ __ ] go to war
with them based on his rhetoric and then
the final thing to say about this is
this this is a very tricky situation
there's been a lot of paradoxical stuff
happening so this has been these
protests have in the West been hijacked
and exploited by neo cons and
right-wingers and it is the grossest
thing to see like John McCain who
famously sang on the campaign trail bomb
bomb bomb bomb bomb Iran they so he's
saying like yeah let's bomb him you know
literally Hillary Clinton who was always
super hawkish on Iran in fact that was
one of the main reasons I voted against
her in 2008 in the primary by the time
it got to New York it was just between
Hillary Clinton and Obama and I voted
for Obama one of the reasons why in the
Oh a primary is because Hillary Clinton
was not doing interviews where she's
talking about how I'm no well not under
any conditions talk to them and maybe we
use force I was like what the [ __ ] this
is what this isn't a Republican primary
so Obama was saying I'll talk to them
without preconditions and the media was
spinning that like it was a scandal I
was like that's not a scandal that makes
perfect sense of course you want to talk
to your enemies to figure out if we can
make peace so he said I'll talk to them
without preconditions I was like that's
reasonable I'm gonna vote for him
because at the time remember it was
difficult a difficult choice because
Hillary was actually campaigning on
single-payer back then and Obama
was not so it was like whoa who do you
go for it was it was kind of a toss-up
but then when you I looked at all their
policies I thought Obama was slightly
better because he also had rhetoric
against money and politics Hillary did
not so but we don't need to go back and
rehash all that stuff the bottom line is
Hillary Clinton John McCain neo-cons
like Bill Kristol all these people are
like a Donald Trump [ __ ] Donald Trump
was on Twitter talking about we're
watching closely for human rights
violations we have you have to side with
the protesters who want basic human
rights [ __ ] there are people
over a dozen people who are facing what
40 years in prison because they were by
some broken windows on Inauguration Day
in the u.s. you are cracking down on
protesters these are there were
journalists who were arrested and some
of them were facing life in prison
thankfully I was cut down but there are
people who are on trial and you're
acting in an undemocratic way I mean
[ __ ] ask Edward Snowden how the u.s.
really Tate how serious the US takes the
first amendment he's in [ __ ] hiding
because you want to prosecute him and
the head of the CIA who you picked is
openly saying we should execute him you
don't get to [ __ ] lecture people
about human rights you [ __ ]
you're [ __ ] arming Saudi Arabia and
they're bombing women and children in
Yemen shut the [ __ ] up with your pho
cries human rights human rights anyway
did you see my first raid as president
which killed a young American girl yeah
I increased drone strikes 432 percent
and have been massacring civilians all
over the place I got rid of the rules of
engagement in Somalia I loosened them
but now I'm gonna faint concern about
human rights when I can't paint on
torturing you [ __ ] campaigned on
torturing and as oh you're on the
respective protestors please oh we care
so much about human rights here in
America nonsense
[ __ ] nonsense in fact Colin
Kaepernick takes a knee other football
players take a knee they tell you it's
because we are against state violence
when you have police officers killing
unarmed people and you go on a crusade
trying to ruin people's careers you know
teller disrespecting Affleck
disrespecting the flag and now you're
pretending you care about human rights
get the [ __ ] out of here so this is why
this is I mean this is next-level
annoying because even if you have
sympathies like I do for the protesters
and you want them to I don't know move
past an Islamic Republic and do a
peaceful transition of power to a purely
democratic society where Hassan rouhani
for example who's president would run
stuff and then you have elections and
okay this person runs an ester in other
words if you want to move past the
Revolutionary Guards and move past the
Islamic Republic and the ayatollahs
which I do that's what I want for Iran
right wingers around the world are using
this to exploit the circumstance to try
to destabilize Iran so that they can get
a u.s. puppet in there see this is why
this is so but to be fair there's also
the flip side hypocrites as well and
those are people who are gonna not not
nothing to see here these protests are
irrelevant these protests don't matter
support the Iranian regime because the
protests are outside paid agitators
foreign agents who are just trying to
[ __ ] rabble-rousing or trying to
destabilize this country
that's not true either man that's not
true either the idea that you have to
support their god support that
government that government is very
oppressive of course it is of course now
of course it's not as bad as Saudi
Arabia but that's not saying much
that's not a very high bar so the people
who are reflexively and to be fair these
are people on the left in Western
countries the people who are reflexively
backing the government like not the
Iranian regime did nothing wrong that's
[ __ ] hacky and reactionary also so
you have a weird paradox happening here
where left wingers in Western countries
are supporting the right-wing Islamic
government of Iran but right-wingers in
the US and in other Western countries
are supporting the left-wing protesters
so it's a weird paradox that's happening
here where what's my position here's my
position
I hope the protests put enough pressure
on the government where there are major
concessions made and you have
significantly less power given to the
Revolutionary Guard and given to the
Ayatollah and you have a more democratic
system pop up I mean ideally I'd like to
I wish
Iran was totally secular I hope these
protesters succeed on that front
I hope they succeed in ending the
corruption and getting more of the
fruits of their labor and getting a
government that's more fair and just to
them so I'm in favor of the protesters
doing that and getting those concessions
and moving in a more peaceful direction
but I am by no stretch of the
imagination okay with any foreign
interference I don't want to I don't
want to hear another [ __ ] word out of
the United States from anybody in our
government about I'm on this side I'm on
that side shut the [ __ ] up shut the [ __ ]
up the United States toppled the
democratically elected government of
Iran in 1953 toppled there was a guy who
came to power Mohammad Mossadegh who
said I'm gonna stop letting Britain in
the u.s. take all of our oil at a
discounted price that's what they did
they would just took the oil
oh you're our puppet so you give us the
oil and you screw over your own people
Mohammad Mosaddegh came to power said
I'm not gonna allow that anymore
it's our oil it's our oil so the u.s.
said can't have it CIA did a coup and
put the Shah into power
so we toppled their government in 1953
that was a bad idea that was a terrible
idea
that laid the groundwork and much later
down the road in 1979 you had the Shah
violently overthrown in an Islamic
Revolution so I don't want the u.s.
intervening in any way stay the [ __ ] out
don't try to go in there and topple them
don't try to aid the [ __ ] protesters
by giving them weapons or whatever don't
do any of that stay the [ __ ] out of it
because it's none of our [ __ ]
business and we're not honest actors
here we're biased we want to have a
puppet regime to us of course that's
what we do all
the world we support 73 percent of the
world's dictatorships so we don't care
about the well-being of Iranians who our
[ __ ] government was just talking about
bombing okay
so you I should stay out but and
everybody should stay out but I hope
that the protesters succeed in getting
concessions and creating a more equal
Iran a more free and open Iran an Iran
that looks out for the people of Iran
and in Iran that is not a theocracy
anymore so I hope the protesters succeed
while strongly shunning people from the
West and elsewhere who are trying to get
involved in this and exploited for their
own nefarious purposes
Bernie Sanders went on CNN and was asked
about Trump's tax plan and he put on a
clinic and how to message and go on the
offense I understand you're not a you're
not a fan of the tax bill you don't like
the large corporate tax cut and you're
not happy with the tax cuts for the
wealthy but according to the Tax Policy
Center next year ninety-one percent of
middle income Americans will receive a
tax cut isn't that a good thing yeah it
is a very good thing and that's why we
should have made the tax breaks for the
middle class a permanent but what the
Republicans did is made the tax breaks
for corporations permanent the tax
breaks for the middle class temporary
and according to the Tax Policy Center
that same organization at the end of ten
years eighty three percent of the
benefits go to the top one percent sixty
percent of the benefits go to the top
one-tenth of one percent meanwhile at
the end of ten years well over 80
million Americans will be paying more in
taxes 13 million Americans as a result
of this legislation are going to lose
their health insurance health care
premiums are going up we got a one point
four trillion dollar deficit as a result
of this bill and Paul Ryan is going
around saying oh we have to offset that
deficit by cutting Social Security
Medicare and Medicaid to answer your
questions should we have focused on the
needs of the middle class we should have
but the bulk of the benefits in this
legislation go to large profitable
corporations and to millionaires and
billionaires I want to ask you how you
view the election of your newest
colleague senator elect Doug Jones do
you think that this is part of a blue
wave or is this just a one-off because
of the horrific allegations against Rory
Moore well of course why Moore was not a
strong candidate that goes without
saying but if you look at this election
if you look at the election of November
7th what you're seeing all across this
people all across this country are
people catching on to the fact that
Donald Trump ran for president saying
that he was going to defend the interest
of the working class in middle class and
it turned out he lied you have a
president who told us that he was going
to provide health care to everybody then
he proposed the
thirty million people being thrown off
of health insurance his tax plan was
going to benefit the middle class the
bulk of the benefits go to the rich and
large corporations he was gonna take on
the drug companies and then he appoints
the guy to head the Health and Human
Services Agency who comes from the drug
companies etc etc so I think what you
are seeing is a referendum on Donald
Trump about a man who said one thing
during the campaign and his actions are
very very difficult different he wanted
to drain the swamp well it looks like
the swamp now is more billionaires in
his administration than any president in
American history
so I think the what we're seeing in
Alabama what we're seeing in Virginia
New Jersey and it states all across this
country a large voter turnouts where
people standing up and fighting back and
demanding that we have a government that
represents all of us not just the 1% if
I were the Republicans I would worry
very much about 2018 and what I'm gonna
be doing is doing everything that I can
to rally working people and young people
to develop policies that protect workers
and the middle class not just
corporations and billionaire that was
very well done the Democrats should take
notes and just do exactly what Bernie
Sanders is doing there because that's
how you message and you mark it properly
and you know he dared to be nuanced
there at the beginning and he's feeling
the heat over it because what people do
many corporate Democrats have taken that
out of context when Jake Tapper Assam oh
is it our our the Trump tack cuts a good
thing for the middle class and he's like
yes so many corporate Democrats have
taken that out of context and they're
using that to smear Bernie Republicans
as well are taking that out of context
and using that to smear Bernie in fact
the RNC released a statement said
something ridiculous like the Grinch
turns into Sanders Claus and is happy
with tax cuts for the middle class from
our tax bill well first of all wait a
second you you're saying he was the
Grinch and now he's Sanders Claus
because he's giving you tax cuts because
he's okay with tax cuts for the middle
class but didn't you used to smear
as being Santa Claus before by
pretending like oh he's in favor of free
college and free healthcare so he wants
to give people all this free stuff so
he's like Santa Claus and oh my god
isn't that so pie in the sky
you know unicorn fairy dust nonsense and
we should be against Santa Claus here we
should be against Bernie Sanders acting
as Santa Claus use this Mirim like that
now when you think the argument of Santa
Claus makes sense in your favor you say
he was the Grinch now he's you know
Sanders Claus and that's a good thing
that he's Sanders Claus just their
messaging they don't know what the [ __ ]
they're doing I don't know let me fling
mud against the wall and hope it sticks
but corporate Democrats and Republicans
are Republicans are going to see all our
tax such array even Bernie Sanders loves
it well Bernie Sanders voted against the
bill of course so why are you not
putting the rest of the context in there
and for the corporate Democrats trying
to smear him they're trying to say he's
too Pro Bernie so definitely don't go
with Bernie Sanders in 2020 go with some
corporate Democrat because they don't
they don't they can't actually defeat
Bernie corporate Democrats can't defeat
Bernie by having a real honest
discussion about their policies versus
his policies so the only way to fight in
that situation is smear the guy I don't
know just say likes Trump's tax plan
boom there you go so he was daring to be
nuanced and of course he was raked over
the coals for it but when his real
argument was is yeah the middle-class
tax cuts are great those should be
permanent but you have to decouple them
from the tax cuts for corporations and
the rich and of course they didn't do
that they made the the tax cuts for
corporations and the rich permanent and
you know the ones for the middle class
there's a sunset provision on them and a
decade out you're gonna have what 80% of
the the benefits go to the top one
percent sixty percent of the benefits go
to the top point one percent so this is
this is class warfare that's what this
bill is they'll that they do and they
say oh we're gonna come back and make
these tax cuts permanent for the middle
class
yeah sure this is what they always say
man they always have something they
could spin it you know they act like oh
don't worry we're gonna cut corporate
taxes but
get rid of all the loopholes so that
therefore the corporate tax rates
basically gonna be about the same well
then why not just keep the [ __ ] tax
rate the same because they're lying they
don't want to actually keep the tax rate
the same they want to keep the loopholes
in and lower the rate so that they pay
an even significantly lower rate so this
is the this is the nonsense this is the
[ __ ] that's coming from the right on
this so I agree with Bernie too by the
way I've often said on this show I've
never met a middle-class tax cut I don't
like and you know Ted Cruz was trying to
smear Bernie he was saying like oh okay
Bernie then vote with me to make it
permanent it's like no Ted again you're
not getting it Bernie saying I like the
middle-class tax cuts we should have if
we want it to vote on that on their own
I'd vote yes but you're adding in with
it you know doubling the estate tax in
the sense that it used to be five
million and above when this for the
state tax to apply you now it's 11
million and above a reduction of the
corporate tax rate from thirty five
percent to twenty one percent there's so
many ways in which you just [ __ ] hand
barrels of cash to the rich and this is
class warfare on the middle class of
course he's not going to vote for that
part of it so you know Ted Cruz acts
like me I like tacit tax cuts for
everybody me okay but the American
people don't
the American people want to act cuts for
the middle class but not for the rich in
corporations
Ted the main part that Ted loves is for
the rich and corporations and then you
know the the second point that Bernie
made there is a very important point
which is he's putting everything in
context about Trump he's arguing listen
this guy turned his back on the middle
class this is the guy who said I'm not
gonna outsource your jobs you know we're
gonna keep the jobs here NAFTA was
stupid TPP is stupid you know I'm not
gonna cut Medicare Medicaid Social
Security this is what Trump said you
know he made these arguments on the
campaign trail well guess what now
that's the next trick the Republicans
passed this tax bill adding 1.4 trillion
dollars to the deficit then Paul Ryan he
already did it turns around the next
week and goes oh look at this [ __ ]
deficit we got to attack this deficit so
we got it I mean we got a reform
title mints which means cut entitlements
and anytime you hear those words
reformed in your mind immediately go to
cut cuz that's what they're saying
they say reformed to take the sting out
of what they want to actually do which
is cut it so you know hey guys you could
have just not increased the deficit and
then you wouldn't have to turn around
and go oh we got to cut entitlements but
no that was the whole point the whole
point was we don't care about the
deficit adding to the deficit it doesn't
bother us at all when it's for tax cuts
for corporations in the rich and this is
what we wanted to do all along was cut
Social Security and Medicare so that's
what we're gonna do
and remember Trump said I'm not gonna do
it Bernie's done this where he's gone on
the the Senate floor and he's shown
Trump's tweets on this Trump did like
you know there's a tweet for everything
is what everybody's saying now and
they're right there's like 10 different
tweets where Trump like I will never
like Mike Huckabee copied me by saying
he's not gonna cut Medicare and Social
Security I was the first Republican to
say that but Donald Trump is a liar and
he did turn his back on the middle class
I mean he said I'm not gonna outsource
your jobs well guess what the last year
under Obama there were 87 thousand US
jobs that were exported under Trump's
first year 93 thousand so there was an
increase in outsourcing jobs for mr.
made in America I'm not gonna outsource
jobs tremendous unbelievable I mean and
we shouldn't be surprised because this
is a guy whose own products are made
overseas so what's he gonna go in there
I'm really gonna fight for the American
people
you didn't even fight for the American
people when it was your own company now
you want to you know pass legislation
that forces everybody to keep the jobs
in the US you're not gonna do that and
he didn't do that
so I think Bernie's much more effective
at tearing down Trump than any other you
know national politician I mean of
course like ROH Khanna he's superb at it
and there's a few others but you can
count them on one or two hands because
what Bernie can do is he can actually
disagree on the policy front whereas
with so many of these Democrats you get
just teeth las' [ __ ] arguments like a
Russia your Putin's puppy
you did treason what and they'll you
know they'll say impeachment we're gonna
impeach and then you go okay well number
one what for exactly and then they just
give you kind of vague stuff they don't
tell you exactly what for and then
number two how are you gonna impeach
when the overwhelming majority the house
is our Republicans Hagan impeach so it's
like you're chasing your own tail I'm
resisting
I think impeachments a good idea instead
of yelping about [ __ ] impeachment and
rush all the time and instead of arguing
against like you remember Trump did is a
few times he's been in the middle of a
speech and he goes to sip some water and
he doesn't like a toddler he takes two
[ __ ] things and he's like hold you
from both sides like a kid would and you
know they'll talk about that all day CNN
host what's-his-face Cuomo Chris Cuomo
yeah I think that's his name he was like
he did a segment where he might where he
mocks that it's like but this is how
they resist and then they'll turn around
and agree with his Jerusalem move like
anything policy wise and it's mild
resistance sometimes agreement but then
on everything not related to policy
that's when they really dawn rush drop
when Paige went mm-hm
but Bernie can go out there and say
listen this guy's a liar and he's
screwing you over a thousand ways to
Sunday he's outsourcing your jobs their
next move is they're gonna come for your
Social Security and your Medicare they
have rich tax cuts out the wazoo when
Trump was the guy who said I'm gonna
raise taxes on hedge funds he did argue
that so but he lied he [ __ ] lied
you're gonna listen to a guy who calls
himself anti-establishment and then
appoints multiple Goldman Sachs workers
to his administration you have the
[ __ ] Treasury secretary and his top
economic adviser
these are Goldman Sachs lackeys and
guess what they're crafting you know tax
proposals that benefit Goldman Sachs so
and this is the guy who argue against
Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton saying
they're bought by Goldman Sachs and Wall
Street and then he appoints them
directly to his administration now
Hillary was horrible with
street of course but even she would have
known you don't [ __ ] pick the
president of Goldman Sachs to be in your
administration just like you don't pick
the CEO of ExxonMobil to be your
Secretary of State you at least have one
layer of removal one degree of removal
from the corruption you at least go with
the guy who was in government but his
best friends with the Exxon Mobil person
or the Goldman Sachs person you don't
immediately go to the person because
then everybody goes oh [ __ ] this is all
a [ __ ] scam and they're all just
trying to screw us over so it got it's
so amazing he said he doesn't case turns
back on everything he says it really is
amazing how he's he has no shame none
whatsoever
held she'll just turn around but you
know that's we again we shouldn't be
surprised this is the guy who was saying
he was gonna jail Hillary during the
debates like in his first week in office
he's like yeah I'm not gonna he said
like I'm gonna have a special prosecutor
look into her during the debates way
after he got elected oh oh yeah I'm not
gonna do that we're not gonna try to
jail Hillary because he just he says
anything he will say [ __ ] anything so
Bernie showing the real way to resist
and everybody who wants to defeat Trump
should hop on board the way to do this
is to focus on the specific policy
disagreements because you don't need to
sell the American people short you know
he said well we got a frame at a
different way because they might not get
it no they [ __ ] get it if you point
it's not hard to figure that out oh look
he X he outsourced 93 thousand jobs when
he say he wasn't gonna outsource jobs
that's even more than Obama that's not
hard to get people can see that people
can [ __ ] see that so this is how you
defeat him and this is why Bernie
Sanders without a doubt is the
front-runner on the Democratic side for
2020
[Music]
hey everyone welcome to the sixth
edition of establishment exiles my name
is Mike Ferraro I am reporting live from
calculon's B's old massage parlor studio
and with me today on the show I have a
Lacey Anu can you hear me LEC is my
internet going off oh okay
yeah we hear you now okay because I just
paused okay it was probably my internet
I think that Comcast is throttling me
because of my [ __ ] talking we also have
we also have Ashley Hudson here today
hey and then of course we have our
special guest host of secular talk and
co-founder of Justice Democrats Kyle
kolinsky hello everybody thanks for
having me appreciate it yeah thanks so
much for coming on the show and also on
such short notice - this is we
appreciate him in oh my pleasure yeah
you know in the spirit of the holidays I
thought it would be great for us to talk
about snowflakes now I don't want to
focus on left-wing sjw's because I think
we all agree that they are problematic
on our side but we all speak out against
them the ones who in particular get a
pass are the right-wing sjw's who I
think are even more easily triggered
than left-wing sjw's I'm talking about
Serna vish I'm talking about
evangelicals and you know it's a it's a
special topic today which is perfect for
our yes because nobody shits on right
within cow Klinsky so Kyle you lately
have been kind of going after Serna
[ __ ] so do you have anything to say in
particular about right-wing sjw's
because i think you really hit it best
yeah I think what's uh most frustrating
about that crowd is the fact that they
kind of make a point of pretending that
they're really really principled and
they care so much about free speech and
that you know hey everybody should get
over it if you're offended like nobody
cares about you being offended like we
care about facts over feelings but then
at the first chance they feel like they
get the opportunity they immediately
flip on that and I've never seen a
better example of it than what happened
recently with Sam cedar how you know
Mike Serna vich dug up an old tweet from
Sam cedar in 2009 where Sam was
basically poking fun at people who were
excusing Roman Polanski's the
allegations against Roman Polanski of
like raping a thirteen-year-old so you
know he's had something along the lines
of if my daughter ever get gets raped I
hope it's by like a very talented man or
something like that and they dug this up
took it out of context pretended like
he's literally Pro rape like okay really
like what person on planet earth has
ever wished to their daughter was raped
like it's so obviously an attempt to be
sarcastic but they took it out of
context presented it wasn't sarcastic
and then they go on this you know this
crusade of trying to get him fired and
they briefly succeeded and what stunning
was like a few of these people tweeted
at me because I you know said how
they're [ __ ] hypocrites and I can't
believe how fast they flip on this
belief and suppose did belief in a free
speech and so many of them hit me with
like well you know maybe it's time for
the left to get a taste of its own
medicine and it's like well then you are
just admitting that you want to be an
equal and opposite hypocrite so if
there's somebody you know on the Left
who says I don't want to give a platform
to this hateful person and we should
protest them giving a speech at a
college campus well you're saying is I
would do the same thing if you know
let's say an tyfa was gonna go somebody
who's an anti full leader was gonna go
give a speech at a college campus i
would be the one standing out there with
the sign saying don't allow them to come
here and it's like well then just be
honest and admit you don't believe in
free speech you just use it as a tactic
to you know really use it as cover for
the most heinous people in the country
what you'll notice is that whenever it's
like whenever somebody's like genuinely
bigoted they'll never come out and say
no i'm going to defend this person's
bigotry they'll say oh man
why don't you why don't you let him talk
it's about free speech you're allowed
you're supposed to let them talk so they
use it as a cover for like disgusting
ideas and so that that's what it's
really about that's why you see like for
example Tommy Lehren has been just the
biggest one like oh you're such a
snowflake get over it nobody cares if
your feelings are hurt and then
meanwhile she's the one who's like
cheerleading people like Colin
Kaepernick getting fired for peaceful
protest you know it's like well there's
a perfect example where you could stand
up and say hey listen I'm the person who
said I'm principled on free speech this
guy's doing a nonviolent protest against
police brutality so he should be
protected he should still have a job in
the NFL even though I disagree with him
on the issue he should you know
everybody should let him keep his job
but no they flip immediately based on
their own political leanings so I guess
the thing that annoys me the most is
that there's plenty of people who [ __ ]
on the Left whenever there are
authoritarianism the left-wing and you
know they D platform people on college
campuses and stuff there's like a
universal uproar when that happens but
people on the right just get away with
their snowflake ISM in the most brazen
ways like Donald Trump is another
perfect example and I'll just give this
last example and I'll shut up and let
you guys talk but so for Donald Trump I
mean he sued Bill Maher cuz Bill Maher
made a joke about how Donald Trump's dad
might be an orangutan like he sued him
he literally served him with court
papers if you to now take Donald Trump
out of the picture and imagine that's a
left-wing college kid with pink hair how
that would be the biggest story but Dave
Rubin would have [ __ ] seven episodes
about how this this pink haired college
kid is the biggest threat in America to
free speech
but when it's the President of the
United States who does it not only do
they not talk about it they act like
he's a hero for free speech and he's
busting a political correctness when he
is the quintessential example of a
right-wing snowflake and social
injustice warrior that's I think my
favorite of Donald Trump's lawsuits was
when he sued the journalists that said
he was a millionaire
and that was incorrect because actually
he's a billionaire somebody yeah that's
a great example I didn't know about I
knew he did a bunch of suits over speech
stuff but like I didn't know about
that's a good one I got to add that to
my repertoire yeah definitely add that
one because that is quintessential
Donald Trump in the way that he argues
it is through this economic lens right
like my my net worth and my image and my
brand is Trump and I'm so rich and
people want to be associated with it
because it's you know it's a
spectacularly decadent and that's
because I'm a billionaire not a
millionaire right so yeah so that that's
it's I actually haven't thought about
the oaf lake aspect of somebody like I
mean actually no I was gonna say up
somebody like Trump but he's the
quintessential snowflake yeah he was
triggered by being called a millionaire
so he needed a safe space he sued to get
his safe space back the billionaire safe
space and speaking of being triggered
I've been talking about net neutrality
I've been tweeting a lot of naughty
words to you know politicians and FCC
commissioners and whatnot and then I had
a right-wing snowflake tell me that the
minute I started to use profanity my
point was lost so everything that I said
disregarded so I responded saying I'm
sorry I triggered you snowflake but the
next time our public officials screw us
over I'll be sure to keep your feelings
in mind and it irritates me because
these are the same [ __ ] people like I
went through this this is an individual
I won't name drop him because he's just
a nobody but he has videos on YouTube he
has his own little show that talks about
snowflakes and whatnot so they will rail
against you know people who are against
seemingly against free speech on the
left but they never say anything on the
right and I don't want a name drop too
many people here because I don't want
this stuff too many people but
hypothetically speaking one show that I
used to watch I'll call it the Dubin
Report so I went through this
individuals Twitter feed 0 posts about
net neutrality if you really care about
freedom of speech
aren't you shouting from the [ __ ]
mountaintops right now about what's
gonna happen I mean right-wingers like
Baked Alaska I just named rocks goddamn
it no but like Baked Alaska they were
bad from Twitter Milo Unocal is banned
from Twitter these are people who are
against net neutrality I don't know
about Baked Alaska but Milo kanopolis is
against net neutrality but he's willing
to allow you know seemingly left leading
companies like Comcast who sponsored the
Democratic National Committee or
convention in 2016 to take control of
the Internet does he not think that
Breitbart would be censored and not
included in a Comcast news package if
they say one thing that's controversial
I mean I don't understand it if you
really care about free speech this is
the issue of our lifetimes perhaps that
will have the biggest impact on free
speech yeah so the hypocrisy is what
drives me absolutely insane so whenever
you talk about right-wing social
injustice warriors it's it's therapeutic
for me because nobody articulates just
how big of hypocrites these people
really are than you so well yes don't
worry
it's hard to tell on the net neutrality
issue which ones on the right are lying
and which ones have genuinely been duped
by the propaganda so like you look at
somebody like ah gee pi it's not hard to
tell ah dude PI's a liar
rajat pi knows exactly the ramifications
of his actions
he knows he's doing the bidding of the
Internet service providers he knows is
gonna ruin net neutrality and freedom on
the Internet
he knows that now you're gonna have the
internet turn into a lot more like a
cable type thing where you got to pay
for different packages but like somebody
like ben shapiro or you know somebody
like ruben for a like i there's a chance
that they might just be that stupid
where they fell for the propaganda on
the right where they try to pretend and
if you notice this is how you know
they're so incredibly wrong and it's so
disingenuous is that the only argument
they have is to just totally lie and
pretend like no no we're the ones who
are for net neutrality if you look at
the way this was framed by some of those
cretins on the FCC that's what they said
like NetApp eyes like no no I'm the one
who's actually for net neutrality so
what's so amazing is that they have no
argument so much
much to the point that they just have to
pretend to be the people who are
opposing them and that's really really
really sad it is yeah and it just gets
back to this whole idea that if you if
you truly care about freedom of speech
then this is an issue that you should be
you know speaking out about but the
problem is that they don't really care
about freedom of speech to talk about
freedom of speech you know in the
left-wing SJW sense the only reason why
they purport to care about it is because
that gets you clicks it's no Milo you
innopolis you know getting shut down
from berkeley or whatever that gets you
a lot of clicks so i think that a lot of
it what one part of it is clicked baby
and basically just trying to ride this
wave of anti sjw ism which again none of
us will deny that left-wing
authoritarians are a problem but the
problem is that these people who are
supposed to be in favor of free speech
they never acknowledged the hypocrisy on
their own side and the biggest some of
the biggest ones who are I think right
wing sjw's are the evangelicals I mean
the people like Jim Baker Pat Robert
Robertson these are people who are
triggered at the dumbest things ever
just the existence of homosexuality for
example there's Roy Moore how can they
not see that and speak out against that
it drives me Christians have a right to
the First Amendment Mike Christians are
the ones that can run for office because
you have to swear on the Bible was
founded as a Christian nation and the
Constitution is a Christian document so
when you have all these people coming
and start suddenly starting to to swear
to uphold the Constitution and their
Muslim that that can't be right Roy
that's really your labor Roy Moore that
is literally the argument yeah Roy Moore
is spokesperson exactly Bo thank you I
take pride in that you know it can be a
hard job but like the arguments that he
uses is based on this Christian
theocracy that only this specific group
of people are allowed these protections
under the law and then every
else and these are people that also say
that diversity isn't good that America
should be shedding supporters in America
is a judeo-christian nation needs to
uphold its values so then those rights
only apply to a very specific set of
people what's funny you're right and
what's funny is that they're kind of
admitting the worst version of
themselves like they're kind of
admitting the strongest left-wing critic
version of themselves when they say like
oh we're only Chris you have to swear on
a Bible so obviously only Christians can
run for office like when they say that
they're kind of admitting that like oh
yeah we also don't think that minorities
really have rights either because of the
fact that the founding of the nation
there was the you know the three-fifths
compromise so like they viewed as people
so when they say something like that
like oh you wouldn't mean you have sworn
a Bible so obviously only Christians can
run like in Harran is in that is this
idea of like well obviously only land
owning white males really had have
rights and that's like a total
verification of their strongest critics
who would argue hey these people are
bigoted these people are against anybody
who's not like themselves then they go
on and prove it when they say stuff like
that I mean that happened and I could be
like mr. membrane it but there was
something that happened here at the
state level honestly I don't even
remember where night remember reading
about it like a few months ago but um
they recently like at the state level
passed a law makes that it could be
slightly misremembering but the basic
premise is I think so like daycares ones
that are Christian daycares you know
there's a lot of Christian schools
Christian Ashley was the clarify you're
in Alabama right so that's what you're
referring to Alabama I know I said I
could be slightly mentioned membranous
but if I'm I believe they made it so
that he's like daycares or whatever
they're told they they could refuse
people on the basis of religion which is
crazy because they're always like
religious freedom religious rights but
I'm pretty sure cuz I think I talked to
somebody about this my guess is they
just want to keep like you know Muslims
out and maybe just not god-fearing
people which is
crazy it's crazy to me that they can do
that but that's what they did
and I don't you guys remember either um
it was a while back some couple of women
went and they protested something that
Jeff sessions was doing I think it was
not long after he after he got it got
appointed what they were protesting
something that he had I can't remember
and it I think actually they just said a
couple of things like they didn't agree
with I don't know if you guys can
remember this but they were actually
removed removed from there and I think
not only were they removed but I'm
pretty sure that they were gonna be
charged just for saying they disagree
with what Jeff sessions was doing and I
if I remember correctly it was pretty
like minimal and and pretty unoffensive
relative to it a lot of other things are
going on so that's a good example of one
of your like snowflake yep Jeff Sessions
and I don't remember but yeah yeah they
they define their rights as their right
to take away everybody else's rights
that's very and that's not a stretch
that's not a stretch either because when
you look at even historically take a
look at the arguments that were made
back during segregation when you know
the northern states and the federal
government we're trying to basically get
them to stop doing that they would say
oh no here we go with the Northern
Aggression again and this is this is all
about state even back to slavery they
used to say no no this isn't about
slavery this is about states rights so
they always try to pivot and change the
argument to states rights because in
their mind they mean the states rights
to determine that people are inferior to
them and then they get to take away the
rights of other people so that's that's
part and parcel of their ideology and
their philosophy it's I get to do
whatever I want to whoever I want and I
get to control them and I get to take
away their rights and that is my right
to do that and if you disagree with that
you're wrong and the protesting example
such a great example because you're
right this is this is also something
that happened on the day the on
Inauguration Day or a bunch of protests
and there was a there were like a few
people who were violent but they
arrested like hundreds
of people and charge them with these
whatever it was like felony rioting or
something and so many people are facing
like 60 years in prison as a result of
this hey and it's still happening right
yep there's a case going on right now do
you guys remember I think it her name
was it red fawn
yeah who might my remember and it
quickly she facing life in prison I
believe she is is that kind of or the I
don't know if it's life in prison it's
certainly more than twenty like it's
it's insane
but it's really insane sentence like for
the for the node Apple thinks she was
kind of like leading the doing a lot of
leading the protests and it's it is just
I I couldn't I mean even for our country
I couldn't believe it when I read that
the kind of sentence she was up against
for protesting this kind of thing yeah
and there's there's been a bunch of
these laws that effectively criminalize
protesting that are being passed in
Republican legislatures around the
country so again this goes right back to
the main issue here you would expect the
people who love to pretend like they're
the most in favor of free speech and the
First Amendment that they would be the
first ones to go nuts whenever there's
an example of a law passed at the state
level that tries to criminalize
protesting but no those are the people
who are actually passing the laws they
have nothing to say about actual threats
to the First Amendment
yeah and Attorney General's from
conservative states they actually penned
a letter to Jeff Sessions office the US
Attorney General asking him to be able
boy oh boy do we have stuff to talk
about I know many of you have been
anxiously awaiting my comments on this
matter and much to the chagrin of
probably everybody involved in this
whole thing I'm gonna do the only thing
I really know how to do which is to be
100% honest with everybody involved and
and give my take and lay it all out
there
so I'm sure most of you have heard about
all this already but nonetheless here we
go rehashing it so a few days ago
this story comes out Young Turks founder
janggu Gore apologized for ugly
insensitive old blog posts exclusive
liberal host once wrote that women are
genetically flawed because they don't
want to have sex often enough so what's
gonna happen is I'm gonna go through
this I'll try to get through it as much
of as possible without commenting and
then you know I'll come back and and
give everybody my take so in other words
I don't really want to go point for
point here I want to get it all out of
the way and then we'll discuss it so
they say Young Turks creator and host
Jake youger made multiple graphic and
disparaging remarks about women in his
early days as a blogger including saying
that women were genetically flawed
because they don't want to have sex
often enough the rapp found the blog
posts from the early 2000s in online
archives in an interview with The Wrap
ugar apologized and said he deleted the
ugly posts a decade ago because quote I
don't stand by them the stuff I wrote
back then was really insensitive and
ignorant you've you're said if you read
that today what I wrote 18 years ago and
you're offended by it you're 100% right
and anyone who is subjected to that
material I apologized to and I deeply
regret having written that stuff when I
was a different guy you ger said he
wrote the posts while he was still a
conservative before he underwent Apple
transformation into a liberal his news
organization The Young Turks now offers
left-leaning stories and commentary
quote if someone said that today I would
heavily criticize them on the show and
rightfully so and I have I've criticized
myself over the years he added I had not
yet matured and I was still conservative
who thought that stuff was politically
incorrect and edgy when you read it now
it looks really honestly ugly and it's
very uncomfortable to read in an entry
from 2000 ugar complained about not
having enough sex while living in Miami
quote it seems like there is a sea of
tits here and I am drinking in tiny
droplets I want to dive into the whole
goddamn ocean he wrote obviously the
genes of women are flawed they are
poorly designed creatures who do not
want to have sex nearly as often as
needed for the human rights to get along
peaceably and truthfully in another
entry rules of dating youger describe
how fast physical intimacy should
progress women ignore these at your
peril he wrote rule 1 there must be some
serious making out by the third date if
you haven't felt your tits by then if I
haven't felt your tits by then things
are going things are not about to last
much longer in fact if you don't get
back on track by the fourth date you're
done he added Rule two there must be an
orgasm by the fifth date you know post
archived in 2003 he wrote about
carousing carousing carousing with the
numerous women in New Orleans while
drunk I had one of the best nights of my
life at Mardi Gras I kissed over 23
different women saw and felt countless
breasts and was in a wonderful drunken
stupor thanks to my friend John Daniels
read the post John Daniels is sometimes
used as a nickname for Jack Daniels
whiskey you were told the rap that all
of the behavior he described had been
consensual the posts were written during
the earliest years of you Gers career as
a journalist on Young Turk calm which
today redirects to a website for the
Young Turks so
I hate to do this but we're gonna do it
let's go to Jenks original blog on this
titled semi-pros in Miami and you know
look we're gonna go through it like I
said some of this stuff is very
uncomfortable to do but my job is always
to be 100% honest with you give you all
the facts and then give you my take on
it and discuss of course the fallout
with justice Democrats so he said I live
in Miami now there are uncredited there
are an incredible amount of outrageously
hot women here in fact there are more
beautiful women here than any other city
I have ever seen the only problem is
that after seeing these girls every day
and not being able to have sex with them
after a while you begin to lose your
mind don't get me wrong I hook up a
decent amount defined as at least make
out with a new girl every six to eight
weeks and have sex with a steady girl at
least once a week but it seems there is
a sea of tits here and I'm drinking in
tiny droplets I want to dive into the
whole goddamn ocean the waves keep
pounding you every night on South Beach
and the more luscious the surf and the
more dry you are the more insanity sets
in on Friday night I talked to
approximately 11 different women at a
new club on the beach most of them were
unfairly beautiful and I must admit I
was fairly charming something even
indicated I was cute but alas no results
the madness froze there are two problems
which I will get into greater detail on
later but for now suffice to say there
are one too many semi-professional
 in Miami to the genes that God
gave women one in other places in the US
when I tell girls that I quit law to
become a talk-show host they get excited
because it indicates how I might
actually be an interesting person that
does have that has done something
unusual and hence cool thing with his
life in Miami it is seen as a clear
decrease in earning potential and is
heavily frowned upon I have never seen
girls get so turned off as when I tell
them Miami girl I no longer practice law
this reckoning this reaction is
sickening in its depraved
blatant Asst this happened again on
Friday night when I told what seemed to
a sweet fifth to I think it's both
say what seemed to be a sweet fifth
grade teacher my story she lost all
interest quickly lost her sweet smile
and literally switched seats so as not
to sit next to the man that threw away
such good future earning potential
number two obviously the genes of women
are flawed they are poorly designed
creatures who do not want to have sex
nearly as often as needed for the human
race to get along peaceably and
fruitfully so the first time I read that
I have to admit I'm a little I don't
know what the right word is I'm a little
on the spectrum if you will and I'm a
very literal-minded person so when I
read through this the first time I
thought okay well I don't know that's
like the textbook definition of sexism
to say the genes of women are flawed
there are poorly designed creatures now
I I've spoken to a bunch of people about
this and I have to say that my reading
of this has changed from the first time
I read it and I don't given the total
context I think that's poking fun at
himself he's basically like whining
about how he can't get laid and then
he's saying well I mean look obviously
it's not my fault it's the genes of
women they're flawed and they don't want
to have sex enough like so I think this
is and he described it at the time oh
I'm trying to be politically incorrect
and edgy and stuff but I don't think
this is you know a thesis of his I don't
think this is an actual belief of his
nor do I actually I don't think it was a
belief of his back when this was written
in 1999 when I when I read it when I
read it a second time third time fourth
time I thought no my own literal
mindedness is getting in the way and I
it's not it's not a statement of fact I
think what he's doing is he's he's
poking fun at himself for not being able
to get laid
now some of you might say well Kyle
you're not you're an idiot for not yet
that originally maybe I don't know maybe
I am an idiot for not being able to like
perceive the the satirical nature of
this originally but I didn't perceive it
originally and then when I keep reading
it over and over now I do kind of see it
because again he's whining about how
much he can't get laid
now this to me so this line was the
operative thing that led to a tremendous
backlash obviously the genes of women
are flawed now in my mind and some
people might disagree with this but I
have to be totally honest with you guys
in my mind everything else he said like
oh the Deline about it seems like
there's a sea of tits here and I'm
drinking in tiny droplets there are some
people who may be very very outraged by
that in my mind you remember how I hate
to make this comparison but it's
actually going to make sense so I have
to make this comparison you remember
when Trump got caught with a grand by
the I don't even wait and then
they said afterwards that's just locker
room talk well number one I don't think
that was locker room talk because Trump
said I grabbed him by the quote I
don't even wait so the problem wasn't
the grabbing him by the the
problem was that I don't even wait
because that implies no consent but when
I read what jenk said here a sea of tits
and I'm drinking in tiny droplets and I
want to dive into the ocean to me that
is actual locker room talk you know
that's how young men talk and you might
say that's crass and you might be right
but I don't think that there's anything
there that is unforgiveable by any
stretch of the imagination there were
other things that Janke said that were
also part of this controversy and people
use this to try to say hey recently he
also is showing the same mindset that he
showed back when he wrote these blogs in
the late 1990s and early 2000s and they
point to these Suites the improbable
breasts in Miami are only matched by the
improbable butts this place makes LA
look real hashtag Miami this is from 20
the next one just when I think Miami is
all done it pulls me back in the women
on the island are outrageously almost
unacceptably hot again I think this is
just standard regular guy talk now again
this line here I think is the operative
line that people were very outraged by
and there was a backlash over but upon
me reading at a 2nd 3rd 4th time I now
do think it's kind of satirical and I
don't I don't view it as an actual
belief of his back then nevermind today
there's a zero chance he believes any of
that today
so in the wake of this article being
published justice Democrats and jankier
have split ways here now jankier has
said he's going to still continue to
individually support all the candidates
of justice Democrats but he's going to
do from the outside of the organization
not on the inside and I can give
everybody the mechanics of what happened
so when people on the staff saw these
things that he said the overwhelming
majority of them said basically look it
it's him or us so either he steps down
as a face of the movement because a face
of the movement should have said these
things about women under no
circumstances so it's either him or us
either you know he stays in which case
you need an entire new staff to do all
the difficult infrastructure work or he
goes as a public face of the movement
and the staff stays and we continue
doing all the infrastructure work and
all the work necessary to move forward
now jenk handled this in as mature away
as possible because Jenks said listen i
this isn't about me this was never about
me
this is about the canned
this is about the policies that they're
fighting for so I'm going to he offered
his resignation he offered he said okay
I'm going given the the reaction that
this is causing in the staff this isn't
a hard decision i I will voluntarily
resign and you know you guys can keep
fighting on and I'll support you from
outside the organization the Justice
Democrats statement that announced his
resignation wasn't cordial it was framed
in very venomous way and in a way I
don't agree with they intimated that
Genk was sexist and racist and they said
Genk is part of the patriarchy I don't
agree with that they said that he abused
his power like other officials which
implies that there's some sort of a
parallel or a comparison between Janke
and guys like representative Conyers or
genk and Al Franken I reject that
implication and I reject that comparison
I don't agree with that at all
in a retweet they even implied that his
words and actions quote perpetuate rape
culture I couldn't disagree with that
any more strongly than I do
even if you agree with the harshest
interpretation of Jencks comments they
were made 18 years ago and for over a
decade he's come to be the polar
opposite kind of person in fact jank has
run his company and a newsroom for over
a decade and there have been a grand
total of zero complaints made against
him so I am I am on the board member I'm
on the board of justice Democrats and I
was faced with a decision among the
other board members I'm not the only
person I either override the majority
the overwhelming majority of the staff
in which case I'm undemocratic
or I don't try to override the
overwhelming majority of the staff in
which case on some level on being
spineless I didn't have the power or the
leadership authority to look at the
overwhelming majority of the staff and
say I'm not going to take your concerns
to heart and I'm gonna have jank stay on
nor did jank say listen I don't care I'm
gonna override the will of the
overwhelming majority the staff and I'm
gonna stay on so for this reason of
strong differences strong disagreements
with the staff I'm gonna be stepping
down from justice Democrats now I don't
want people to take this the wrong way I
still with all of my heart believe that
all of those members of the staff are
vital and they're very important and I
respect each and every one of them and
the work that they put in must be fully
appreciated because it really was a lot
of work and it's really stuff that I
don't have the skill set to do on my own
and they bring something very important
to the left-wing movement
it's beyond crucial that each and every
one of us still support the candidates
because the candidates had nothing to do
with any of this
every single one of the candidates has
my support they all still support
Medicare for all and free college and a
living wage and ending the wars and a
new new deal and getting money out of
politics and they weren't even involved
in this drama or the fallout or the or
the very quick decision-making so I want
everybody to know that I'm not just
saying that that even though I'm
resigning from justice Democrats each
and every candidate still deserves our
support still deserves our donations
still deserves our time to actually put
in work at the grassroots level and to
fight for them to get elected so that we
can get our vision implemented basically
what this comes down to is an amicable
split between the media wing of Justice
Democrats and the remainder of the staff
of justice Democrats and I want
everybody to be respectful to all
parties involved here and to understand
that this what's going on right now this
is nothing it's drama that will come and
go within a few days or a week or two
and then we all still have to fight for
a better future for everybody we all
still have to win on the policy issues
that matter and I have full confidence
that every single candidate will fight
for those things so that's pretty much
everything I have to say on the matter
and I hope that all of you even if you
are upset about the departure of genk
and myself from the organization of
Justice Democrats I hope all of you will
do your best to dig down and not be
petty or vindictive about this and to
throw the baby out with the bathwater I
hope you will understand that it truly
is it's it's my wishes and my will and
Jencks wishes and Jencks will that
despite the differences with the
organization of Justice Democrats on the
staff of Justice Democrats the
candidates of Justice Democrats
literally had nothing to do with any of
this and they're still fighting for all
the right policies and they all deserve
our support
boy oh boy do I have a little bit of
news for you here lookie what we have
just as Democrats is now 51 candidates
strong against the oligarchy 51
candidates I blinked and we added over a
dozen more candidates so listen I'm
gonna tell you about three of them here
I highly recommend you go to justice
Democrats calm and read about the rest
of them what we're trying to do with
justice Democrats is take the Bernie
Sanders political revolution and take
over the Democratic Party kick out the
corporatists and have politicians that
are uncorrupted who take no corporate
PAC money and they only represent the
people they will only fight for their
constituents and that's what every one
of these candidates is bringing so every
time I read about these guys I mean it
is I get filled with joy at the prospect
that we have such fantastic candidates
running so I mean think about that add
it over a dozen candidates in this most
recent batch we now have 51 candidates
okay so let me tell you about a few of
them here first we have Dan cannon so
he's running in the ninth district in
Indiana let's watch this video of Dan
here and then we'll come back and
discuss some more sometimes it's the
hands sometimes it's the eyes without
saying a word people tell me they've
never had someone to fight for them
so I do it's why I became a lawyer to be
the voice for the people who do right
everyday work their whole lives and
still gets screwed by a health insurance
company by a bureaucracy that doesn't
care by a government that doesn't listen
I fight to make things right for people
sometimes making history usually making
a difference I never thought I would run
for Congress of a real person who's had
real problems I was raised by a single
mom in southern Indiana dropped out of
high school before I found my way
sometimes I've lived paycheck to
paycheck not a perfect life definitely
not a politician's life but too many
things in this country are broken and
it's time for real people right here in
the heartland to have someone fighting
for them again it's time to make sure no
one has to choose between paying the
rent and pay for medicine time for a
woman just as good as her male
co-workers to get equal pay and it's
time that's special interests with money
stop getting all the breaks that Indiana
working families start getting a few
we're the wealthiest country this world
has ever known and on too many streets
in Indiana you'd never know it
I believe we can afford to start doing
better with real people jobs you can
live on real opportunities
in healthcare that's a right not a
privilege my work has always been face
to face and eye to eye and that's how I
see this campaign we're gonna build a
movement one in the in a small town one
diner one front porch at a time
if you're ready for change I'm ready to
fight
a populist in Indiana I absolutely love
it I couldn't love it any more so the
most amazing fact about Dan is that he
was on the legal team that got us
marriage equality he was on the legal
team that went to the Supreme Court and
won the case on gay marriage that's okay
I can't overstate how awesome that is I
mean this is that is a pivotal moment in
US history that's when we took the next
step in ensuring equality for everybody
and justice you know that's like having
somebody who fought against segregation
who was pivotal in the fight back
against segregation running for office
here we have somebody who got marriage
equality who was on the legal team that
got us marriage equality isn't that
incredible and now he's running for
office he's taking no corporate PAC
money he's running on Medicare for all
he's running on a new New Deal he's
being a populist I I think we can win
these races I really do we just have to
get the word out there that's the point
we have to get the word out there and we
have to raise enough money for them too
because since they don't take any
corporate PAC money they're at a
permanent financial disadvantage and
that unfortunately is a giant factor in
these elections did you know over 90
percent of the time the candidate that
raises the most money ends up winning so
that's we're at a disadvantage in that
respect but when I look at how awesome
these candidates are I really get filled
with hope and I think we can do this
thing okay so that Stan can an amazing
story then we also have here in the 50th
50th district of California Ammar compa
majare now he is an American of Mexican
and Palestinian descent so he has a
really interesting story
his mother is Catholic his father is a
Muslim Palestinian in fact he spent time
growing up
in Gaza and witnessed a war I mean you
want to talk about gaining some life
experience think about what he had to go
through so he's running against
Republican Duncan Hunter now if you know
who Duncan Hunter is when I said his
name you recoiled and you were like I
need a [ __ ] shower after hearing that
Duncan Hunter number one has argued he
wants to stay in Iraq indefinitely okay
right off the bat you are 100% out of
lockstep with the American people who
want out of these unnecessary Wars he
wants to stay in Iraq indefinitely he
floated the idea casually in an
interview of nuking Iran that's like
Sheldon Adelson like yeah we should send
a message and just like Newcombe or so
what this guy is a congressman he's
elected he said yeah maybe we knew Quran
and the third thing about Duncan Hunter
is he somehow managed to find a way to
violate our already weak ask campaign
finance laws and he's under literally
under investigation by the Justice
Department because he so brazenly
violated our campaign finance laws that
takes an extra level of skill and an
extra level of corruption because but
we've legalized bribery already but he's
like no I will still find a way to you
know break the few rules that we have
now again when we talk about justice
Democrats Ammar takes no corporate PAC
money no corporate PAC money raising
small dollar donations is a 100 percent
grassroots populist campaign so it's
almost like you couldn't get a starker
comparison the most corrupt among a
bunch that are already corrupt versus
somebody who says no I'm not even going
to take any corporate PAC money so let
me give you some of Amar's quotes he
says from campaign finance to the way we
conduct elections we have a system that
gives inordinate influence to insiders
major corporations and the politically
connected but that's not how democracy
is supposed to work I will fight for
reforms inside
Democratic Party as well as in Congress
that put people first we need to ask
ourselves whether the Democratic Party
should put the interests of
super-delegates above those of the
American voter we need to explore ways
to limit the influence of super PACs on
both sides of the aisle whether through
a constitutional amendment or by
preventing out of district special
interests from overwhelming our local
election and we should be discussing
issues like term limits so that we have
more representatives and fewer career
politicians okay
so on health care II says the following
quote health care is another priority of
mine if elected I would support
legislation to expand Medicare and move
rapidly towards single-payer health care
I support Medicare for all and would
vote yes every time how do we pay for it
we already do one-fifth of American
dollars which is three point four
trillion dollars last year are spent on
health care
let's make health care our right for all
instead of a privilege for the few 100%
correct
and again I love that because what's he
doing he's flipping the debate you know
how Republicans go Medicare fraud we
can't afford it we can't afford it we
can't afford it
well I've argued for the longest time
because it's true actually we can't
afford not to do it because if we keep
the system as is our health care system
will cost 49 trillion dollars over the
next 10 years Medicare for all over the
same time period 32 trillion dollars you
save 17 trillion dollars if you do
Medicare for all and you cover everybody
no more medical bankruptcies no more
millions of people uninsured no more
45,000 people dying every year because
they don't have access to basic health
care so I love it I love it he's for
Medicare for all he's educated on the
issue and he's a fighter now we move on
to the next one
so the previous two I spoke about their
candidates for the House of
Representatives we have another Senate
candidate and she
is amazing wait until you see this
little clip and her talking about the
four issues that she uses the most
important issues the top issues in her
mind so Deidre Abood is running for
Senate in Arizona of course right now we
have McCain and flake as the senator
from Arizona and both of them will be
out of the Senate shortly but look at
this here's what
Deidre's about
not just to higher education than to
college but you know why we don't look
at more trade schools so he won't wonder
George trade school so he will need to
go to trade schools we need to be
looking at how we can make sure we have
a minimum and how we can empower people
for the next step that works for them no
country is prospered that doesn't have
an educational system that lists of the
population and the United States has a
history of reading one of the first
countries in the world to focus on the
education and now our we are always
stuck out was that no one can have
religious liberty and let everyone has
religious liberty and that has to
include the ability not to have religion
there is no way that the state can
decide which religious interpretation
works because no religious
interpretation covers everybody even if
you just start
these are clearly important because the
reason why we have attacks on the LGBTQ
community the reason why we have attacks
on women's productive freedom is based
on religion isn't it
so refreshing to hear Democrats who
stand for something they believe in
something they're fighting for something
and I have to say I got a little bit
giddy hearing a Muslim woman in hijab
talking about how awesome secularism is
separation of church and state because
that's like the beauty of America right
there and it flies in the face of
genuine bigots on the right who would
take one look at her and assume like you
know all these negative backwards things
but here you have a Muslim woman in
hijab going one of my top four issues is
separation of church and state because
it's the inter tangling of religion and
politics that leads to the oppression of
minority groups like the LGBTQ community
there was for religious reasons we had
people argue against gay marriage today
over 20 states make it so you're legally
allowed to fire a gay person simply
because they're gay well Deidre food is
gonna fight on the proper side of those
issues and then she says I'm top 4 as
you'd Medicare for all free college
separation of church and state and net
neutrality which she by the way defines
as a free speech issue she goes this is
this is a real attack on our free speech
is
now you have odd Pi in the FCC doing the
bidding of the Internet service
providers and giving them carte blanche
so the Internet service providers can
slow down traffic to sites that they
don't agree with or sites that didn't
pay their bribes to them so what an
amazing candidate really an amazing
candidate and all of our candidates are
great again now we have 51 listen we
have no more excuse
we don't have an excuse anymore Bernie
Sanders political revolution is here so
it's time to do something about it
listen go to justice democrats comm
check your district scroll through all
the candidates all 51 look at the
different places where they're running
now we have three senate candidates the

House of Representatives see if one's

running in your state if you live in
Arizona go volunteer for Deidre bood

no more excuse we're gonna come back
here when all the elections happen and
we're gonna get to give ourselves a
report card you know we're gonna get say
okay well we had the candidates that are
representing the things that we believe
in so how did we do in terms of turning
out so now it's on us so we have for the
Senate we have Paul Swearengen running
against Joe Manchin Allison Hartson
running against Dianne Feinstein and now
we have Deidre Abood running in Arizona
so let's do it let's do it by the way to
to donate to the new slate of candidates
and by the way they need it I just over
a dozen candidates and to run 51
campaigns you need a tremendous amount
of money to keep all just the [ __ ]
infrastructure in place to keep the
operation going never mind spending
enough to actually win so we need it we
need the money for sure for the new
slate of candidates which is over a
dozen for the 51 candidates total but if
you want to donate to this new slate of
candidates
the link is gonna be right below the
first link in the video description box
and I highly recommend donating if
you're in Arizona you know or if you're
in somebody's district if they're
running for House representatives give
your time man go go talk to the campaign
see what's up knock on doors if you have
to do phone banking calling if you have
to all that stuff because again now we
have no excuse and we do have a system
that's biased against us in our fight
here
you know we've covered a zillion stories
of how the maitre media just ignores us
they just ignore us
Amy vilela is running to take a seat
after the person's resigning because of
sexual harassment Reuben Cohen he's
resigning he's like I can't run again I
got caught sexually harassing people in
the articles discussing that they didn't
even bring Amy up
she's already in the race she has an
amazing personal story she's fighting
for Medicare for all harder than anybody
cuz her daughter died because we don't
have Medicare for all
can you imagine a male congressman
saying I'm resigning because I'm a I got
caught being a sexual harasser and you
have a female candidate already running
to take them over that seat from the
male candidate and they don't even
mention her and they float the names of
other peopie what about this person what
about that person what the [ __ ] you
talking about why not Amy because she's
gonna fight on these issues that's why
they ignore us
that's why corporate media ignores us
that's why the Democrats ignore us you
know the d-triple-c is trying to snub
all the justice Democrats they're trying
to make them sign pledges like hey by
the way you're not allowed to do a tax
that might hurt that might hurt your
opponent in the general election sign
this thing that says you won't do that
so then you're saying disarm don't
attack the corporate Democrats because
their corporate don't do it cuz it might
hurt no how about they [ __ ] fix their
goddamn positions and then we won't be
able to attack them because they're not
for Medicare for all they're now for
free College kind of [ __ ] is that
it Sam and then they say you have to
spend 75% of your money on [ __ ]
however we dictate you spend it what
well the Democratic establishment you
lost a thousand
seats under Barack Obama your formula
sucks so why the [ __ ] would new
candidates have to follow your shitty
outline which didn't work why would they
do that because they don't care about
winning they care about propping up
corporate Democrats and continuing the
status quo they care about mealy-mouthed
[ __ ] politicians who talk about you
know we should like increase access to
health care why are you [ __ ] using
weasel words why are you saying access
why not say medicare for all
single-payer why are you not yeah well I
think we should increase access and
maybe we should tweak things slightly
while we still serve Wall Street and Big
Pharma and private health Andrew
I'm done with that [ __ ] now we have
no excuse we have 51 Justice Democrats
running that's 51 candidates that are
politicians in the mold of Bernie
Sanders that's exactly what we call for
that's exactly what we wanted when we
looked at the disaster that was the 2016
election where a corporate democrat lost
to a neo-fascist monster who was a
reality star so now no excuse no excuse
get out there get involved let's [ __ ]
do this thing and just so everybody
knows I take no salary for justice
Democrats jank you your co-founder takes
no salary for justice Democrats joi Koch
chakrabarti former top Bernie Sanders
campaign official take no salary for
justice Democrats we I don't want it
because it's not about that it has
nothing to do with me it has to do with
the philosophy that we're pushing for
here we want to make America a thriving
social democratic system that has
Medicare for all has free College has a
living wage does a new New Deal gives
people jobs fixes our country and now we
have the candidates that are fighting
for us that are right on the issues so

video description box we absolutely need

envisioned it would get this big just as
Democrats we have 51 candidate how do
you even [ __ ] keep track of 51
candidate it's [ __ ] crazy how how do
we do that
well turns out there's just as many pee
people out there as us who really care
about this stuff and say listen this is
no-holds-barred son we're going all in
we're gonna throw everything we got at
the establishment because we know we
need populist left candidates we know we
need to fix this system so we can't sit
on our ass anymore because then we won't
be able to sleep at night knowing we
didn't do everything we could have done
well now we are gonna do everything so
get involved get involved in a campaign
make phone calls knock on doors donate
time donate money we got to win this
thing man
we have to win I want to win every
single race I want to win every race so
let's try I can't imagine a better slate
of candidates let's go do it
so it officially happened Republicans
passed their tax bill I want to go ahead
and give you a full breakdown of it here
in as simple and straightforward terms
as possible so you get a sense of the
details of it so first of all it passed
the house 224 to 201 it got zero
Democratic votes and twelve Republicans
actually voted no on it now for those of
you who are a little bit baffled by that
don't be because what happens is
typically Republicans from otherwise
democratic districts in democratic
states sometimes they get elected and
when they're elected they know like oh I
should probably not 100% vote party line
with Republicans because then I'm gonna
get my ass voted out so that's that
explains at least partly explains why
you have 12 Republicans who voted
against it now in the Senate it passed
51 to 48 straight down party lines not a
single Democrat voted for it thank
goodness and every Republican voted for
it obviously John McCain isn't there he
went back home to Arizona he's gay you
know getting treatment for cancer and
the reports are doing too well and he's
on borrowed time at the moment so he
went home to Arizona and every other
Republican voted for it including Susan
Collins who's supposed to be the
moderate one she feigned concern about
certain parts of the bill but then she's
like yeah anyway I'm gonna vote for it
and by the way she also brushed off
criticism of the vote as sexist she
there's a lot of sexist covers this what
so you're you're doing the mix feminism
trick just like Hillary hide behind your
gender to try to deflect from serious
policy criticisms against you that's
what susan collins is doing thank god
come on you can't criticize my vote
don't be sexist well you know there
there are clearly reasons to criticize
the vote that have nothing to do with
gender and in fact I've all I've seen is
substantive criticisms of Susan Collins
vote so let me first give you the parts
of the bill that you know are either
benign or you could argue they're
they're actually a good thing
so the standard deduction is going to be
raised to $24,000 for couples and
$12,000 for individuals which is a near
doubling from the current levels so
these are provisions that could help
regular people and certainly up front
they could help regular people the child
tax credit will grow from $1,000 to
$2,000 only the first fourteen hundred
will be refundable and access for poor
families they say is not significantly
expanded so in other words they're you
know they're expanding the child tax
credit but not by much so that's all I
got in terms of ones that you could look
at provisions you could look at and say
okay not not terrible but they're
Republicans so clearly they have tricks
up their sleeve and you're about to know
the gigantic downside of this bill so
first of all the popularity of it what
are we looking at I mean this just
passed so in a democracy it obviously
has about 51% right I mean you wouldn't
want a political party pushing policies
that's fundamentally opposed to what the
American people want right the approval
rating is 33 percent only 33 percent of
Americans favor this bill that is very
very unpopular and people have brought
up this criticism to Paul Ryan he just
brushes it aside he's like yeah you know
misinformation something the media fake
news media is spreading fake news and
that's why people don't like it so we're
just gonna brush off the fact that we're
passing a piece of legislation that's
overwhelmingly unpopular in a democracy
in what's supposed to be a
constitutional republic and a
representative democracy
shouldn't that be like one of the most
important things you weigh in
determining whether or not to pass a
piece of legislation like in a world
that made sense that would be the case
right you have politicians who get
together and they go okay let's pass
this legislation [ __ ] we just got a poll
in that's
only 33% of people supported I guess we
got to redo the legislation until it's
something that people at least at least
51% of people like nope
didn't do it so then we moved to another
gigantic portion of the bill that I
don't think has been talked about enough
in all of my readings that broke down
the bill prior to its passage I didn't
see almost any discussion of this the
individual mandate in Obamacare is
repealed which basically gets rid of the
glue that holds together Obamacare
because when you don't have the
individual mandate you don't have enough
people in Obamacare you don't have
enough funding to you know pay for
people when they need care so the
individual mandate even though to be
fair it's the one provision of Obamacare
that when you break it down piece by
piece that the American people say yeah
we're not really sure we're in favor of
that one if you get rid of that the rest
of it basically falls apart but that's
why they did it and according to I think
it's the Congressional Budget Office or
according to independent analyses of
this provision it's going to result in
number one higher premiums for people
number two 13 million uninsured people
so they just you know in the blink of an
eye they just go yeah let's kick
thirteen million people off of their
health insurance
not good not good
and then also again up front this bill
cuts almost everybody's taxes you're
about to see in the long run that's not
the case at all
but even whatever amount you might save
in taxes up front that might be more
than made up for in the fact that your
premiums are going to increase for your
health insurance you know and depending
on it depends which analysis you read
but it's about 20% there's gonna be
about a 20% increase which offsets some
of the upfront cuts okay what else do we
have well this bill eliminates the
alternative minimum tax which is a two
hundred and fifty billion dollar cut for
the rich so for those of you who don't
know the alternative minimum tax is
basically this rich people have a
[ __ ] incorporations they have a team
of lawyers to try to figure out how to
weasel out of paying their taxes and
they use them so the alternative minimum
tax makes it so that lets say a rich
person finds a way to get their tax rate
all the way down to fourteen percent
let's say on income they somehow made it
so that they could chip away and get
their income tax down to fourteen
percent well the alternative minimum tax
says no you're gonna have to pay at
least twenty five percent so again rich
individual the tax the marginal tax rate
would be thirty nine percent they get a
team of lawyers to chip that all the way
down to fourteen percent by using all
the loopholes but the alternative
minimum tax goes no you can only deduct
up to twenty five percent you're still
gonna have to pay at least twenty five
percent on your income well they got rid
of that they got rid of the alternative
minimum tax so now if you get a team of
lawyers to get your tax rate down to
fourteen percent so be it you pay
fourteen percent which again two hundred
fifty billion dollar cut for the rich
and this has to be made up for somewhere
and where are they going to shift the
burden it ain't to other rich people
it's to you they'll shift the burden
onto you and then on top of that they
just add to the deficit again we'll get
to that in a little
it then you have massive a massive
corporate tax cut this is really the
crux of the bill this is where most of
the cuts go so the top rate goes from 35
percent to 21 percent and it saves
corporations 1.3 trillion dollars over
ten years 1.3 trillion now I'm sure you
could already tell like that's a
ridiculous thing because corporate
profits are at record highs right now
they're not struggling there are no
where near struggling it's the opposite
they're thriving and they get a cut the
corporate tax rate from thirty five
percent to twenty one percent but when
you get to the history of it it's even
worse so in 1952 the corporate tax rate
accounted for thirty three percent of
all federal tax revenue today the
corporate tax rate or corporate tax is
bringing less than nine percent of
federal revenue so again that tax burden
is going to shift some where
corporations used to pay thirty three
percent of federal taxes now they pay
less than nine percent and the
Republicans just made it so they're
gonna pay even less than that so now
corporations are not bringing in a
significant chunk of the federal tax
revenue they're gonna shift the burden
onto you
which leads to the next fact here all
households earning less than seventy
five thousand dollars a year which by
the way is the overwhelming majority of
the American people they're gonna see
higher taxes by 2027 so over a decade
the people middle class and poor people
less than 75-thousand working people
they will see a tax increase an increase
now it's funny because you see honestly
chumps who've fallen for the Republican
tax scam who have tweeted at me where
they're like they liar your lawyer about
the tax rate going no I'm not lying
every end
pendant analysis says that that when you
extrapolate a decade out the the taxes
on people making $75,000 a year or less
it goes up but then they say we're but
upfront it gets cut
but isn't it curious how all the tax
cuts for the rich and for corporations
permanent all of them permanent but just
so happens for the middle class and the
poor not permanent there's a sunset
provision on it so when they say all
will come back you know that's the thing
we're gonna come back and make it
permanent for the middle class well then
why didn't you already do it you have
the numbers you have the overwhelming
numbers in the house you have the
majority in the Senate you guys say hey
we're all about cutting taxes for middle
class and poor people so why didn't you
do it so why didn't you make those every
middle-class tax cut every poor tax cut
permanent why didn't you do that why
didn't you do it Ted Cruz likes to go
around and say all I care about is
cutting tax for the middle class and the
poor I don't care about cutting taxes
for the rich okay so why didn't you make
the rich tax cuts the one with the
sunset provision and all the taxes for
the middle class and the poor the ones
that are permanent they didn't do they
did the opposite why because they're
[ __ ] liars and they're just serving
their corporate donors they're serving
the rich they're serving the corporate
donors there's no question about it it's
not a hard one to deduce it's crystal
clear
every cut for you dad sorry it runs out
sometime but maybe at some point
hypothetically in the future we'll fix
that but for the rich I we made a
permanent now god there's such liars
okay furthermore there's a 2% cut in the
top marginal tax bracket right now it's
about 39% that's gonna drop to 37% so
it's even a cut for not just corporate
profits but for personal income they
take the top rate from thirty nine
percent to thirty seven percent but even
that that's not even the total picture
because there's a what's called a
pass-through tax cut to 30 percent so
what
that means is individuals can register
almost like it's an individual whose his
or her own corporation and what they can
do is register as an LLC themselves and
then the tax that they would play pay if
they do that is 30 percent so really for
a large number of people that are
supposed to be in that top marginal tax
bracket their cut is going from 39
percent to 30 percent so that's and
that's even significantly lower than the
Bush tax rates the Bush tax rates thirty
five percent was the top rate under Bush
by the way blew a giant hole in the
deficit because of the rich tax cuts and
of course the two wars that he put on
the national credit card but so think
about that they say oh look we're only
doing a small cut from 39 percent to 37
percent but then they turn around and
say but we're gonna do a pass-through
tax cut where if a rich individual rich
person registers as an LLC they get to
pay 30 percent not 39 percent not 37
percent but 30 percent more the estate
taxes exemption is doubled from 5.5
million to 11 million so what that means
that an even smaller share of the
ultra-rich are gonna pay the estate tax
and even those who do pay it will pay
substantially less than under the
current law so the estate tax already
applies to I think it's point O 2
percent of the American people because
you have to have a net worth of 5.5
million dollars or more but now they're
saying no we're gonna make that 11
million because you know people who had
7 million dollars were so oppressed by
the estate tax and by the way this is
one of those issues where the
Republicans do their [ __ ] framing
and their marketing or they say no it's
not the estate tax it's the death tax
more ha ha ha and they get regular
people [ __ ] farmers and like Arkansas
or some [ __ ]
to go oh [ __ ] I die I want to pass my
money to my kids I'm against the death
tax but no it only applies the reason
it's the actual name is the estate tax
is that it only applies to people
with [ __ ] estates so again it took it
from 5.5 million and net worth for it to
apply to you it's kicked all the way up
to 11 million so now I don't even know
what is a point oh one percent of
society that it's gonna apply to these
guys they are just one hundred percent
the corporatist party the ultra-rich
party they just into its to a comical
extent alright more the Tax Policy
Center finds that the top 1% of
taxpayers are earning eighty two point
eight percent of the benefits from the
cuts by 2027 so when you extrapolate out
for a decade in totality eighty two
point eight percent of the benefits are
going to the top one percent nobody can
tell you this is not a tax bill that's
totally geared towards doing the bidding
of the rich and corporations nobody can
tell you that that fact right there is
pretty much all you need to know and
then of course the final fact which
exposes the unbelievable hypocrisy of
the Republicans is that this bill is
going to add one point four trillion
dollars to the deficit now notice
something the Republicans always used to
shriek about the deficit non-stop in
fact part of the Tea Party wave was that
they were say odd to deficit the [ __ ]
deficit we gotta fix it oh my god look
at this crazy Democratic president in
the deficits going up so they use that
as like one of their main defining
issues as like we're the party of fiscal
responsibility they say they are when
they're campaigning we got to get this
deficit down you know we don't want to
leave a burden on our our grandchildren
what's wrong with those what kind of
monsters are we but now every Republican
except for the twelve in the house but
the overwhelming majority of Republicans
in the house and every Republican in the
Senate just said I'm yes I increase the
deficit by one point four trillion what
happened guys I don't know what happened
see it's a trick
it's a trick they will scream about the
deficit only when they're trying to make
a case against programs that help you so
if you're talking about health care if
you're talking about education they'll
go oh are you kidding me and this is
their next trick cuz they're gonna come
back
their next legislative movies they'll
come back and go oh now we got to tackle
the deficit so let's cut Social Security
and Medicare and Medicaid you just added
1.4 trillion of the deficit you just did
it you just chose to do it and now
you're gonna try say we have to cut it
for you know middle class and poor
people we have to now we have to do cuts
why because they don't care about the
deficit they never cared about the
deficit it's a trick it's a ploy it's a
scam to try to stop the government from
doing what the people want it to do from
helping regular people working people
but whenever it's to do endless war and
whenever it's to serve their corporate
donors and the rich then they don't care
about deficits at all yeah well I don't
give a [ __ ] loot the Treasury rate it I
don't give a [ __ ] I don't care you paid
my campaign contributions so I'm gonna
do your bidding and what's been really
fascinating is seeing how like there's a
few writers who apparently had totally
drunk the kool-aid of the Republicans
who are right-leaning writers and they
wrote these panicked articles like I
don't understand why the Republicans are
over this it adds one point fortunately
the deficit this is crazy it's like yeah
you [ __ ] naive fool you didn't
realize this that they've been playing
you all along every goddamn step of the
way they and the Republicans across the
board are calling for more war save Rand
Paul not a single one of them said hey
maybe bombing Syria's gonna is
unaffordable nobody said that nobody
said that cuz honestly it's more about
what are your values they value serving
the rich they value serving corporations
they value endless war so then the
deficits will [ __ ] come into their
mind at all it's only once for you yeah
we can't afford [ __ ] Medicare for all
you kidding me it's so expensive I don't
want to give [ __ ] kids right now
right now but
Kratts were like we're put chip
children's health insurance program
funding which gives healthcare and a
nine million kids put that in this tax
bill they're like no what what and then
they'll turn around and say we can we
know the money you're adding 1.4
trillion to the deficit to serve the
rich and you can say we don't the money
well then you don't have the money for
the tax cuts for the rich oh no we have
the money for that even though we don't
they're so shameless they're completely
and utterly shameless this bill is
abysmal and I'm just I just want
everybody to know this is important so
you know log this in the old memory bank
give this a like on YouTube or if you're
if you're watching it through a link on
Twitter favorited on Twitter like it on
Twitter's you can come back and check
this out when it happens hear me now
quote me later there's gonna be another
giant economic crash and that by the way
is everybody's fault but this is the
Republicans are putting that crash into
overdrive they're gonna make that crash
come much much sooner because history
shows every time you cut taxes for the
rich you cut taxes for corporations and
you deregulate you have what's called a
boom bust cycle so everything takes off
we go oh my god the good times are never
gonna end this is amazing and then BOOM
everything implodes that's why there was
the Roaring Twenties
why do they call it the Roaring Twenties
every oh my god the market oh look at
this just so great [ __ ] corporate
profits everywhere and things are going
[ __ ] wonderful and then oh my good to
great to prison so it happened when we
did in the nineteen teens and 1920 same
thing deregulation cut taxes for the
rich boom the Great Depression it
happened after Reagan Reagan came in
there same thing cut taxes for the rich

with sargon of akkad
again my favorite anime crossover I
don't know what Adam a with that last
part means but Sargon and I have
probably done like four or five hangouts
where we we talked about a lot of stuff
so you can go check those out there's
a lot of them some on his channel some
on my channel you know I for the longest
time I would have said Sargon really got
a bad rap from people because a lot of
people kind of tarred him as being like
all right and I always kind of defended
him and said no when you talk to him he
says like he's for universal health care
is for a living wage he's for ending the
wars and stuff but I do think I mean you
asked him but I do think that in recent
times he has shifted more right-wing
like I think he's done a lot of
defending of President Trump which I
find pretty much unconscionable and I
don't know how a guy as smart as him can
do that but again you ask him and see
where he describes himself politically
but in my mind he seemingly has shifted
to the right you know in the past few
months or whatever but he's still a nice
guy we've been friendly with each other
all throughout okay let's see I got some
more super chat questions here I want to
talk about some other stuff too and I'll
get to that but I will do your your
super chat questions as much as possible
Kyle have you ever been approached by
fans in real life if so how do you feel
about it yes I have it's a little weird
at first but then it's you know it's
it's cool I guess you just have to like
digest the fact that there are gonna be
people who talk to you who they
basically know you already and they're
like your friend already but you don't
know them so it's a little bit of a
weird dynamic early on but as soon as
you digest the fact that these people
are basically like your friends and you
just don't know them yet then it's you
know it's a much easier thing to digest
and by the way thanks everybody for for
doing the super chat stuff I really
appreciate that day neurosis Unum as the
last one oh [ __ ] I just missed one of
the super chats guys I'm sorry somebody
uh ROFL gator just sent ten bucks thank
you okay so while you guys like let the
Souper chat roll in and stuff I will
talk about some other
stuff that I wanted to get to today so
first of all let's talk a little bit
about the Republicans having to lie to
pass their tax bill I saw Paul Ryan did
a speech on the House floor where he's
like you know talking about how it's
time to give the people back their money
and there's no way to describe that it's
have to complete another lie I mean
that's what it is according to the
Congressional Budget Office everybody
who makes $75,000 a year or less will
see a tax increase within the next
decade so when they say oh this is for
regular people this is for working
people that's just a flat-out lie and
what annoys me is that the Democrats
seem pretty ineffectual and just
rejecting that and and you know
basically saying you're wrong and I'm
not gonna let you get away with that and
I think they should I think they should
make that like a big part of fighting
back against this tax bill now it looks
like it's gonna pass it already passed
the house it's supposed to be up in the
Senate tonight but apparently asked to
go back to the house and they have to
revote on it because of some obscure
provision about how if it adds more than
1.5 trillion dollars to the deficit
which this will by the way you have to
have a yeah they have to revote on it
because they had to tweak something I
guess I don't know but Bernie's trying
to make that stick where apparently you
would need 60 votes in the Senate to get
it passed which they don't have which
would be amazing if somehow they got
that to stick but the idea is if you add
more than 1.5 trillion dollars to the
deficit in a piece of legislation you
need a supermajority to get it through
but it's amazing how every time any
Republican sells this they have to lie
and that really gets under my skin and
it's really frustrating because it's
almost like they overwhelm you with
[ __ ] so much and they say so many
things that are not true that the
Democrats let a lot of untrue things
just slide but that would be thing
number one where I'd say no I'm not
gonna let them get away with this and
say that this bill is good for regular
people when it raises taxes on regular
people have
the country makes $30,000 a year or less
so if you're talking about raising taxes
on people that make seventy five
thousand dollars a year or less
you're talking about the overwhelming
majority of the American people and you
see that strategy to the strategy of
lying to get [ __ ] done you saw that with
Ajit PI - he was just another clear
example of this where everything he
argued was like no no I'm the one who's
in favor of net neutrality and you know
everybody who's against me is not in
favor of net neutrality and of course
that's total [ __ ] because as you all
know I don't need to explain it to you
guys but the ISPs the Internet service
providers now can slow down speed to
websites that they don't like and that's
[ __ ] crazy that's crazy they can they
can basically try to take money what's
the word extortion is it extort money
extract money whatever the [ __ ] the word
is they can basically try to take money
they demand like a bribe hold them for
ransom and say hey if you want to be
part of this better package well then
you know you got to pay us X amount per
year and basically the way we roll
Khanna explains it the the way the
Internet's gonna work with in the coming
years now because of the destruction and
their neutrality it's gonna be more like
cable which is a crazy thought because
you know you have to buy different
packages for cable oh I want the sports
package okay I want HBO I want Showtime
I want and think about that for the
internet like oh no I guess I can't
afford the package that has Twitter but
I guess I'll get the one that has
Facebook like that's what can happen now
as a result of this and so since nobody
would be in favor of that you can't win
an argument and win a popularity contest
pushing for that idea Hajjah podge his
lies and he's like no I'm in favor of
net neutrality even though I'm the one
destroying that neutrality so it's a
really pathetic situation where one of
the two political parties has to
flat-out lie to get everything they want
past and it's so disingenuous that you
can't even regular people have a hard
time debating it and you see a lot of
people duped by the misinformation on
and the media doesn't do a good job
breaking it down and it just basically
you poison the well you ruin the debate
because half the debate they're just
being disingenuous liars and I always
like to try to not assume bad intent
like I try to give people the benefit of
the doubt and you know say hey if
there's another explanation other than
lying like maybe they just don't know
maybe they're just wrong and you know
they read something that was convincing
even though it wasn't true but with guys
like Paul Ryan and Ajith PI you know
they're [ __ ] lying they're lying and
they know they're lying so that was one
of the things that I wanted to bring up
another thing let's check in real quick
on the super chat okay I don't see any
more super shots well do i if I click
this thing manage moderators
participants pop-out chat toggle toggle
timestamps hmm I just want to make sure
that if you guys hit me with super chats
I see them all I don't want to miss any
I know you identify as a social democrat
how do you feel about politicians who
are further to the left like Jeremy
Corbyn or the Socialists in Seattle
that's a great question Keith Martinez
asked that question so I actually like
it when there are politicians to the
left of me because you're never gonna
get everything you want anyway like
you're never gonna get everything you
want if you're Jeremy Corbyn or if
you're Kshama Sawant who you're talking
about Keith in Seattle
that's a politician in Seattle who's a
socialist since they're never gonna get
everything they want what's good about
having people to the left of me elected
is that they frame the debate and they
argue for a further left-wing position
and then maybe the negotiation position
you know the compromise position becomes
what I prefer so in other words if you
have a right winger and then you have
the left being people who are like
Kshama Sawant or Jeremy Corbyn to the
left of me where they're probably like
post-capitalist I would say although I'm
not sure they'd have to tell you exactly
what they believe but I know they're to
the left to me but okay so maybe the
compromise position becomes the on I
don't know you pick an issue
vacation time you have them one of them
arguing for two months off a paid
vacation every year the conservative
position is go [ __ ] yourself no time off
and then the compromise mission becomes
a month off everybody get some month off
per year so that's why I think it's good
to support people politicians to the
left of you because they're never going
to get everything they want anyway and
they'll fight for those further left
positions and then maybe the compromise
position ends up being a Social
Democratic position which is where I
fancy myself that was a great question
Keith mister slug King take my money you
big Seltzer sellout Thank You mr. slug
King by the way Keith and mr. slug King
donated five dollars there thanks guys
while more of these roll in I'm gonna
talk about a few other things that I
wanted to bring up so Jill Stein Jill
Stein is being investigated in the and
by the way for those of you I don't know
if the lighting on my face is changing
or whatever but I literally have on WWE
in the background right now Smackdown I
don't know but I don't know how many of
you were WWE fans but for those of you
who are curious if you like Smackdown or
Raw better I think I like Smackdown
better you know I'm old school I
remember the days when it was Mondays
and Thursdays you had Raw on Monday
Smackdown on Thursday but apparently
people were saying that like it was
never alive on Thursday they always
recorded it on Tuesday and released it
on Thursday which is why now they do
Monday and Tuesday I don't know I like
I'm old-fashioned I like it the Monday
and Thursday split and I like it it
would be cool if they did Monday live
and then Thursday live but I guess they
can for logistical reasons that would be
my guess but I'm not a hundred percent
sure anyway that's one song in the
background so if you see my face
changing because of the lighting it's
because there's stuff going on on the
screen that's right behind me where was
I Jill Stein okay so Jill Stein is being
investigated in the in the whole Russia
thing that's going on right now I think
it was a Republican who lumped her in as
part of this uh-huh
at least that's what I read I'm not sure
which Republican it was but it was a
Republican who decided oh we
to investigate Jill Stein because of
Russia now I'm struggling to figure out
what even theoretically they're trying
to argue about Jill Stein like so what
exactly are you saying
are you saying that she got in the race
because Vladimir Putin wanted her to get
into the race to be a spoiler to make
Donald Trump win is that the argument
genuinely don't know I'm asking because
that sounds so utterly ridiculous that
it it's [ __ ] laughable because first
of all which establishment pundit didn't
think that Hillary was gonna win in a
landslide that was like the the
mainstream position was Hillary's gonna
win in a landslide I don't even know why
we're concerned about this my guess
would be that you know a guy like a guy
like Putin probably thought the same
thing so but so what's he gonna do oh
just in case it's close let me run let
me you know back a third party candidate
will happen apparently he did a pretty
shitty job cuz Jill Stein God what less
than 1% of the vote or something like
that so I like what are they doing man
and when so they point to this dinner
that she had it she was at some event
Aarti event and Vladimir Putin was the
keynote speaker at this arty event and
Michael Flynn was seated at the table I
think with Vladimir Putin and Jill Stein
was there too now Jill Stein went on a
podcast that the intercept does and with
Jeremy Scahill
and she explained everything about that
day she's like okay so I was at this
event for RT she literally went into so
much detail as to explain what she ate
at that event
she said Vladimir Putin said absolutely
nothing to her there was a language
barrier they don't [ __ ] speak the
same language
so what happened was all he did was he
went around the table and shook people's
hands she said the most in-depth
conversation she had that night was with
somebody who was from the German
government or something like that or
somebody who formerly worked for the
German government so what exactly is
claim that's being made here in this
Russia investigation that there's some
sort of [ __ ] corrupt dealings going
on behind the scene between Jill Stein
and Putin or Putin wanted Jill Stein to
throw the election in order to give it
to Donald Trump I and it's stunning that
people there are many people who get mad
if you call the current climate
McCarthyism you know there was this
amazing in fact I'm gonna pull it up now
Glenn Greenwald wrote a great article
where he spoke about all the mistakes
that the media has been making recently
in the Russia thing and he's basically
saying look they're not mistakes they're
they're likely on purpose because all
the mistakes are made in the same
direction and it's always to try to make
it seem like the Russia thing is like
huge and oh my god the bombshells right
around the corner and oh my god this is
the bombshell oh my god collusion has
been proven but then they had to retract
a whole bunch of stories because they
keep [ __ ] [ __ ] up okay I typed Glenn
Glenn Wald Glenn Greenwald media
yeah US media so the title of the
article is the US media suffered its
most humiliating debacle and ages and
now refuses all transparency over what
happened and in this article he
describes so he gets into the the
WikiLeaks thing how I think it was CNN
who was like oh my god we proved
collusion between the Trump and the
Russians because Donald Trump jr. got
the DNC emails from WikiLeaks before
they even released them to the public so
there it is there's the collusion
because they say WikiLeaks is a tool of
the Russian government not true and they
say oh my god WikiLeaks colluded with
Donald Trump jr. so therefore the Trump
campaign colluded with Russia well it
turns out no it wasn't WikiLeaks that
sent him those emails it was some random
person who they don't even know who it
is
from some random email they sent it to
Donald Trump jr. and it was after the
WikiLeaks emails have been released they
[ __ ] up the date on the email they
said it was September 4th in reality was
September 14th so and the mistakes are
always in the same direction that's the
thing that seems like really nefarious
about this but he provides a list in
this article of just some of the stories
that were like oh my god bombshell on
the Russia thing that had to be
retracted so Russia hacked into the US
electric grid to deprive Americans of
heat during winter by the way reading
that headline alone you should be like
really that's what that's what [ __ ]
Vladimir Putin spending his time doing
let me hack into the US electric grid
what an anonymous group proper not
documented how major US political sites
our Kremlin agents that turned out to be
[ __ ] WikiLeaks has a long documented
relationship with Putin that was
[ __ ] these are all the ones that are
the ones that were admitted where they
were like yeah we [ __ ] all that up
there's a secret server between Trump
and a Russian bank that has been
discovered not true Artie hacked c-span
and caused disruption in this broadcast
not true Russians hacked into a
Ukrainian artillery app Russians
attempted to hack election systems in 21
states links have been found between
Trump Ally Anthony scaramouche II and a
Russian investment fund under
investigation so those are just the ones
that they had to like retract or fix and
a panel on MSNBC discussed the
Republican tax bill and their refusal to
fund chip which is the Children's Health
Insurance Program but what's telling
about this clip is that the host
Stephanie ruhle is kind of ignorant on
the overarching issue so let's watch and
then I'll explain last night
late-night host Jimmy Kimmel made his
return to Jimmy Kimmel Live and he
brought along a very special guest his 7
month old son come one was out last week
while his son underwent a second heart
surgery during his return he made an
emotional plea to protect a children's
health insurance program known as chip
that Congress let expire in October chip
is the Children's Health Insurance
Program it covers around it covers
around 9 million American kids
overwhelmingly Democrats and Republicans
supported it until now now chip has
become a bargaining chip it's on the
back burner while they work out their
new tax plans I don't know what could be
more disgusting than putting a tax cut
that mostly goes to rich people ahead of
the lives of children I want to bring
back my panel Steve and Eddie why don't
they have money for this this seems like
such in America voted for bipartisanship
they voted because they felt like
President Trump was not an ideologue and
he would be pragmatic help me understand
why there wouldn't be the money for this
well there's kind of cruelty and
callousness that kind of rule debate but
who does that win for I don't know who
says right on man don't help the kids
that's what I just can't figure out you
think about what senator orrin hatch
said on the floor in the Senate that we
are broke we don't have the money and we
know that the estate taxes in the tax
plan is actually more expensive than
ship what we have here is definitely and
I and I see the emotion what we're
running here is a value deficit we talk
about monetary deficits but we have a
value deficit in this country what do we
value what do we cherish how do we
extend to our fellows dignity and
standing and the most vulnerable among
us children
but what is the Republican rationale one
of Roy Moore's points I think it was Roy
Moore loves children Doug Jones loves
abortion if it is the party of Family
Values in order to be a family that
includes my children each one who wants
greater power help me the Republican
roundtable says let it ride the
hypocrisy in the rot or worthy of
discussion the meanness the cruelty but
this is very simple to understand and it
gives me no pleasure to say I've spent
my life in the Republican Party is
better to say this this party has
demonstrated a complete incapacity to
govern period and I think that there
will be a tsunami come 2018 that wipes
you're not answering my question I want
to understand who is the body that's
saying this isn't a good political move
we don't have the money they have the
money when they want the money part of
what I'm trying to say is that there is
there is it hierarchy of concern we
don't have the money because we're busy
giving money to our donors we don't have
the money because we're governing for
the top one percent the top wins a great
guy Steve Wynn who raises money for the
RNC the grand pooh-bah over there is
like yep get the kids who's the person
who says let's not do this they don't
care
period well the government is corrupted
it's corrupted it is not about regular
people it is not about that vulnerable
child this tax bill is a payoff corrupt
from A to Z to the special interest
constituencies one thing that Jimmy
Kimmel said was wrong
rich people aren't benefiting from this
faceless multinational corporations are
benefiting from this they've even taken
rich people out of the equation as
beneficiaries of the of the programs so
this is a button paid for corrupted
institution and the American people were
violet
they've assigned it a 15 16 percent
approval level and there's good reason
for that but there's no understanding
here other than the broad understanding
of the magnitude of the corruption and
this is for corporate America this is
why they don't have the money because
they're giving a corporate tax cut okay
I have a lot to say about this so first
of all a quick correction this is for
rich people and for corporations it's
not just for corporations and rich
people are excluded no it's for rich
people and corporations if you look at
all the different tax cuts that are part
of this proposal they overwhelmingly go
to the rich and corporations but overall
those two gentlemen on the panel there
are mostly right there's ain't yeah it's
corruption they're serving their donors
that's what's happening and they don't
care they don't care about the side
effects of this and Oh whoop so we
didn't fund a children's health care
program whatever who gives a [ __ ] so
they're largely right about it but what
I find absolutely stunning is that the
host here Stephanie ruhle she seems to
genuinely be shocked by their answer she
keeps asking why isn't there money for
this
why isn't there money for this she says
it over and over and I don't understand
where's them why don't we have money for
this I can't believe who's sitting back
and going you know what don't worry
about the kids and then they give an
executive an example of a Republican
mega donor it's like he seems like a
nice guy Stephanie anytime you have a
bill like this which overwhelmingly
serves the rich and corporations and
screws over everybody else in the
country if you make seventy five
thousand dollars a year or less your
taxes are getting raised what's going on
is corruption what's going on is
legalized bribery your especially when
it comes to the issue of health care if
you trace back why are we doing policy X
Y or Z you're gonna find big pharma is
profiting
you're gonna find health insurance
companies are profiting you're gonna
find healthcare product manufacturers
are profiting we'll get Tom Price
invested $300,000 of his own money
representative Tom price and then
proposed bills that increase the profits
of those companies you are 100% of the
time gonna find rich people and
corporations profiting you're also 100%
of the time gonna find politicians
taking campaign contributions from Big
Pharma from for-profit health insurance
companies and then they're gonna do
their bidding so I honestly think it's
somewhat indefensible that you have a
host on what's supposed to be the
liberal Network who apparently is
stunned that um corruption legalized
bribery doing the bidding of your donors
in corporate America and the rich
instead of the American people why I
never I'm why why don't we have the
money for this why don't we have the
money I got to show you guys two
headlines because just so you know
anytime they they say wait we don't have
the money for this which literally
senator Orrin Hatch made that case on
the floor of the Senate he said listen
chip the children's health insurance
program sure I mean I'd like to help
those people but I'm not gonna help
people who can't help themselves and we
don't have the money he's talking about
sick kids he's gonna I don't want to
help people who can't help themselves
in other words pull yourself up by your
bootstraps you sick kid but hey we don't
have the money we don't have the money
funny you seem to have money for this
this is a 1 billion dollar new US
Embassy in London 1 billion dollar 1
billion dollar you could have built a US
Embassy for [ __ ] who knows 5 million
you spent 1 billion dollars they always
have the money when they want it they
always do
now that's just a billion we're talking
about how about this next one
there was a u.s. fighter jet program the
new f-35 the program cost over a
trillion dollars point number one is the
old f-35 worked perfectly fine point
number two is for the longest time this
f-35 the new one couldn't even fly
properly but overall in the lifetime of
the program over a trillion dollar was
the trillion dollars was spent on a new
fighter jet we always have the money
when we want it nobody ever says hey
listen we got nine hundred military
bases around the world those bases cost
a hundred billion dollars a year to
maintain I think maybe we should cut
those bases by 50% so we can save 50
billion nobody says that nobody says
that nobody says that nobody says that
nobody's ever said hey I'm not sure we
can afford the 80 billion dollars a year
we give to big banks in corporate
welfare I'm not sure we can afford that
no hey listen I want to give Exxon Mobil
four billion dollars a year in a
corporate welfare check to help them
with the research and development we
can't afford it
we can't [ __ ] afford it we can't
afford what are we gonna do nobody
whenever it's a program for the rich for
corporations for the military-industrial
complex
buh-buh-buh-buh-buh blank check
[ __ ] blank check whenever it's
college whenever it's healthcare
whenever it's a safety net program for
poor people
whenever children's health insurance ah
we don't have the money we don't have
and host on MSNBC the best you're gonna
get from the host on MSNBC and I don't
want to [ __ ] on this conversation too
much because at least the people on the
panel had the answer but it's just
stunning to me she doesn't get it the
host on MSNBC is whoa I can't believe
they don't have the money for this
program in other words she actually
believes them when they say hey we don't
have the money for it like she hears
that and she's like well I guess that
seems pretty reasonable I guess we don't
have the money for it obviously we have
the money for [ __ ] sick kids
clearly we have the money for Sick Kids
100% we have the money for sick
everybody did you know that with just
the increase in military spending this
year just the increase in military
spending this year so not the total
military budget which is over seven
hundred billion dollars but just the
increase which is anywhere from fifty to
a hundred billion dollars you can fully
fund Bernie Sanders free college program
I mean think about that people will
argue we don't have the money we don't
have the money for free college
meanwhile the cost of free college in
total is less than just the increase in
the military budget for this year
they're [ __ ] full of [ __ ] and they're
liars because they're corrupt do you
understand that now also with Medicare
for all you know what they're right is
expensive you know how much it costs
over the next 10 years to do Medicare
for all 32 trillion dollars that's a lot
there's a T in that [ __ ] 32 trillion
but what they don't tell you is if we
don't do it our current system will cost
49 trillion over the next 10 years so
that means there would be a net savings
of 17 trillion dollars if we do Medicare
for all but they still have the nerve to
tell you we can't afford it we can't
afford it no we can't afford our current
system we can't afford a rapacious
unnecessary for-profit cash sucking
middleman to be there anymore that's
what we can't afford but don't worry all
you have to do is out of the words we
can't afford it
if you're a corporatist and you're a
plutocrat and the liberal network hosts
will go out there and say you know gosh
man it would be nice if we had health
care for kids but hey they say we they
can't afford it I wonder why they say
they can't afford it and then she'll ask
43 times hey why can't they afford this
listen
Stephani the answer is always corruption
the answer is always legalized bribery
the answer is always to follow the money
and see who's getting their bidding done
the bidding of the American people is
never done
because we don't have big money donors
we don't have lobbyists on our side so
the chances of a politician doing the
bidding of a grandma from Cleveland
versus the Koch brothers or Sheldon
Adelson or a big-money donor there's no
chance they're gonna look out for the
four regular people so that's what you
should be talking about all the [ __ ]
time I think her ignorance on this is
fairly inexcusable that's what you
should be talking all the time you
should be talking about the corruption
because that's the main driving factor
in our politics how else could we have a
system where 80% of Americans want a
minimum wage increase and we don't get
it
ninety three percent want a universal
background check for gun purchases
because we have a mass shooting every
other week and we don't get it only 17
percent still want to be in Afghanistan
but we're still in Afghanistan I haven't
seen a poll on chip but I'd imagine if
you polled the American people probably
over 90 percent of people like yeah I'm
for health insurance for kids but we
don't get it our infrastructure has a
great of d+ paul the american people ask
them if they're happy with the
infrastructure integrated E+ I'm curious
what their [ __ ] response will be it is
crystal clear the American people want
us to be a social democracy instead
we're a corporate plutocracy kleptocracy
and you need to be the cop looking out
after this and calling out the [ __ ]
but instead you have to inquire
repeatedly because you don't understand
the most basic facts about the way our
politics function it's really sad
thankfully the people on the panel
straightened you out but now now you
know it now you should talk about it
endlessly how we are amazingly corrupt
whenever they say we don't have the
money we do have the money but they just
don't want to prioritize those things
that would look out for regular people
and they don't give a [ __ ] if it means
hey maybe some kids don't get their
health insurance or health care and
maybe they die they don't care they do
not care
Doug Jones has defeated Roy Moore in the
special election in Alabama for US
senator of course Jeff Sessions is
Attorney General he was a senator from
Alabama so they needed to fill his seat
and you had doug jones who's you know
kind of a standard run-of-the-mill
establishment Democrat
I think his voting record will end up
being quite a bit like Joe Manchin for
example but you had him versus the worst
person on the planet that might not be
an exaggeration so Roy Moore of course
was accused had there multiple
allegations of him effectively being a
pedophile I think there was one 16 year
old who said that he literally assaulted
her in a car but then there's another
allegation of a 13 or 14 year old where
he took her out to the woods he picked
her up outside of a hearing that her mom
was at when he was a judge took her out
to the woods tried to get her to touch
his penis and stuff you've heard all
this and we discussed all this before so
no need to go into further detail here
about those allegations but he's accused
of being a pedophile even if you say hey
it's allegations put them all aside
nothing's been proven yet he was a judge
who was removed twice from the bench
because he refused to follow the
Constitution he kept the Ten
Commandments up in his court house and
in the front you know the front lawn of
the of the court house and yeah the feds
said you can't do that
we don't live in a Christian theocracy
this isn't the Christian Saudi Arabia we
live in a secular country it you have to
take it down you have to abide by the
Constitution and take it down he didn't
do it this is also a guy who said in the
past that he thinks homosexuality should
be illegal he also said that he thought
Sharia law has already taken over was it
Illinois so it's so funny on the one
hand he's like oh we got to stop the
Sharia law from taking over but then the
other hand he's like so I can implement
my Sharia law Muslim Sharia bad
Christian Sharia
good so he's just a really really shitty
guy and of course he we already knew
that he was planning on voting for if he
were to what if he won and then he got
seated he was gonna vote for Trump's tax
bill and of course that you know blows
up any semblance of him like looking out
for the little guy I'm going there to
bust up the establishment no you're
gonna vote with the establishment that
tax bill raises taxes on everybody
making $75,000 a year or less so it he's
just as bad as it gets like really
really really bad and though Doug Jones
might let us down in many respects
there's no denying that he's way better
and those were your options so Doug
Jones won I think that's a great thing
he won by almost two percentage points
and this is actually a really big deal
because it's the first time since 1992
that Alabama elected a Democratic
senator now listen he he won by almost
two points but the guy was a pedophile
so in my mind I I genuinely believe that
if more wasn't a pedophile than he would
have won all the other odious things
about him people would have overlooked
or they would have flat-out agreed with
so I mean the they already elected Jeff
Sessions and Jeff Sessions is one of the
worst senators in the country by far in
a way so it's good that doug jones won
but it's kind of crazy that you know you
still had 48% of the voters vote for a
pedophile who has one of the most odious
records i've ever seen so let me go
ahead and show you here the exit poll so
you get a sense of the demographics of
this race because this is really
incredible this is from the washington
post 32 or excuse me 23 percent of white
men voted for jones just 23% seventy
four percent of white men voted for Roy
more white women not barely any better
32 percent of white women voted for
jones which means 65 percent voted for
more
but then look at this black men and
black women 92% of black men voted for
Jones 7% voted for more I'm actually
surprised it was even 7% who the hell is
that 7% 97% of black women voted for
Jones 3 percent voted for more so there
was a lot you know made on Twitter about
how think a black family in Alabama for
keeping a Roy Moore out of the Senate
there's some truth to that I mean these
numbers are overwhelming and here's
another really interesting fact when you
look at the turnout in this special
election usually turnouts for special
elections are low the turnout for this
one was pretty high but what happened
was I think about 93% of the people who
turned out for Hillary Clinton in the
last election turned out for Doug Jones
in this election so that that's amazing
that you know for a presidential race
it's usually way higher turnout here you
almost had all the people who turned out
for the presidential race turnout for
this special election for the Senate
seat but in terms of more only 49% of
the people who voted for Trump turned
out for more so in other words you kind
of had like a little bit of a perfect
storm for the Democrats and that their
turnout was almost as high as if it was
a presidential election and you had half
the Republicans stayed home you know for
whatever reason they might say well
Moore's gonna win it anyway so what the
[ __ ] doesn't matter or me personally I
don't really care about this one because
I don't want to pull the lever for a
pedophile for whatever the reason is
that's a big part of it the Democrats
turned out in in droves and you had half
the Republicans who voted for Trump
stayed home and didn't vote for more now
what are the bigger lessons to take away
from this election though that's an
interesting question I think Charles
Barkley actually broke it down pretty
well on CNN Berkeley by the way he's of
course from Alabama and he campaigned
for Doug Jones so let's take a look at
what he had to say
basement hey listen if any other man had
eight women accusing him of sexual
harassment talking about how he really
enjoyed slavery he thinks people who are
[Music]
homosexuals to go to jail
they wouldn't even been in this election
this was more of a referendum onus to
sit the state of Alabama and I'm just so
proud I'm just so proud of my state I
love my state we got some amazing people
here yeah we got a bunch of redneck and
a bunch of ignorant people but we got
some amazing people here and they rose
up today you know they're you or one of
many prominent African Americans from
Alabama who don't currently live in
Alabama who came and campaigned over the
weekend there was some question over
whether that would that would backfire
obviously it did not the African
American vote really turned out in very
strong numbers you must be feeling
pretty good about the effort that you
made this weekend well number one it
wasn't just about me was about everybody
down here let me tell you something I've
been in Alabama for the weekend
campaigning with doug jones all run more
commercials was he's against abortion
he's against gay marriage and he talks
about god those are not three good
enough reasons to be in the Senate we
got a lot of more important stuff health
care we got to improve our public school
system we got to improve our roads I'm
just so proud of my state they rose up
today last question for you Charles
what's your message for President Trump
tonight as an Alabamian as somebody who
helped deliver the state to doug jones
what do you want president Trump to take
away from this evening well this is a
wake-up call for Democrats your
Democrats and I told mr. Jones this and
I love Doug they've taken the black vote
and the poor vote for granted for a long
time it's time for them to get off their
ass and start making life better for
black folks and people who are poor
they've always had
votes and they have abused our votes and
this is a wake-up call we got in a great
position now but this is a wake-up call
for Democrats to do better for black
people and poor white people that
analysis in my opinion was spot-on
what he's saying is Democrats need to
start serving their base again that
they've taken their base for granted but
here you have a situation where in
turning out the vote there was a lot of
attention paid to the Democratic base so
black people clearly and he also says
poor white people as well and that is
supposed to be the Democratic base it's
supposed to be you know blue-collar
workers you supposed to be middle-class
people poor people people of color you
know people who aren't in power who
aren't elites people who need the
government to craft policy in a way that
helps out regular folks or at least
gives them a fair shot and doesn't rig
it in favor of the rich but what's
happened with the Democrats for such a
long time now the Republicans are so
extreme and so insane they're backwards
on all the social issues but then
they're also 100% corporatists so the
Democrats have said well where they
where's our base gonna go where you
gonna go you're black you're poor but
you know you're a white poor family
you're people of color where you gonna
go there's nowhere for you oh you're
gonna go for the Republicans so
therefore hey I'm gonna lurch to the
right be corporatists like the
Republicans just to a slightly lesser
degree and not serve my base not push
for policies that's gonna help them and
then what the [ __ ] are they gonna do
they're gonna have to show up anyway
well Charles Barkley is saying no serve
your goddam base I mean politics 101 is
you don't abandon your base but politics
101 for the Democrats for the longest
time has been abandon your base I mean
look at the strategy just in the last
election 2016 with Hillary Clinton
you had Chuck Schumer on the sunday
shows openly talking about that saying
listen we don't for every blue-collar
vote that we're gonna lose with our
basically neoliberal strategy
it's okay because we're gonna pick up
two suburban suburban votes from
basically upper middle-class families so
that's him just bragging about our
brilliant strategy is to abandon our
base abandon people of color abandon
poor white people and we think that'll
work out cuz where is it where they
gonna go where those people gonna go
well what they're gonna do is not
[ __ ] show up to the polls or they're
gonna vote for a third party option and
then you're going to turn around and
scold them when they do so as if it's
their fault no it's your fault for not
serving those people in making them what
a [ __ ] vote for you so I I can't
agree with him any more than I do he's
saying Democrats take their base for
granted and they need to focus on their
base and then they have to [ __ ] do
something about it and that gets to the
next point so Roy Moore was a uniquely
shitty candidate I mean again you saw
very high african-american turnout one
of the reasons for that is because Roy
Moore literally is a slavery apologist
now you might say but come on that's you
know Kyle left-wing commentator going
over the top with it no that's he said
hey wouldn't it be better off if we got
rid all the amendments after the 10th
well that means who women can't vote
equal protection under the law is gone
and the repealing of slavery is gone so
that's not it's not like oh I'm I'm
misinterpreting it or misrepresenting it
no that's what he said then there was
also the comments at an event where he
said hey even when we had slavery at
least the country had a direction and
families were strong are you kidding
that's the old [ __ ] coded language of
bigots that's what they do they say uh
and I've heard this in the context of
segregation as well Jim Crow where
they're like well you know families were
strong when we had segregation and black
people were over there and white people
over here hey we might say that's not a
good thing but at the same time the
families were strong so now there's been
the destruction the black family maybe
one of the reasons of that is cuz we
don't have segregation anymore now they
won't say that last part but they
heavily imply it they want you to take
that that away from it they want you to
go man a black family were better off
before what would different before oh
man
we were separate and of course this is
all just mental gymnastics and jiu-jitsu
to try to justify and rationalize the
fact that these people are bigots and
they want they don't want to treat
people equally so yeah maybe that's one
of the main reasons african-american
turnout was so high you had a literal
slavery apologist on top of other stuff
being a pedophile it mean you go down
the list but maybe the biggest point
here is this Charles Barkley says every
commercial I saw of Roy Roy Moore I'm
against abortion I'm against gay
marriage I'm I'm I'm for God I love God
you know he's a theocratic then he goes
we got more important issues to worry
about that's that those aren't good
reasons we got health care we got to
worry about education infrastructure we
got to rebuild these roads we got to
give people jobs and there it is right
there see look again Roy Moore was
uniquely shitty because he's a [ __ ]
accused pedophile slavery apologist
among all the other [ __ ] that's terrible
about his record but like take Trump for
example when Trump campaigned yeah he
was an [ __ ] on many of the social
issues but there was even though he was
lying and it was just [ __ ] rhetoric
at the time there was economic populism
he tied into it he tied in economic
populism he spoke against NAFTA he spoke
against TPP he spoke about keeping jobs
in the US and rebuilding the country and
stop wasting the money overseas in the
wars and he contradicted himself a lot
and the other [ __ ] he said was [ __ ]
crazy and there's no doubt about it and
he's shooting from the hip and he's
amateurish and you can go down the list
of the shitty things about him but yes
there was an element of economic
populism in his rhetoric when you tie in
the social backwardness with the
economic populism that can get the
republicans to turn out for you but when
you're just focusing on the social
backwardness hey man that's not enough
that's not enough
so you're an accused pedophile but all
you have to say in your ads is abortion
is bad and I'm against it gay marriage
is bad and I'm against it and isn't
[ __ ] god wonder
you know these Republican based voters
they're [ __ ] struggling too poor
white people are struggling too so like
there's a lot of poor white people in
Alabama that reliably turnout for
Republicans if all you're talking about
is abortion in the social issues they
might agree with you on that stuff but
they're also going my [ __ ] cousin
just lost his job and he's got no
[ __ ] money you know hey I haven't had
a raise in 25 years what's going on here
you gonna help me out or not help me out
every rhyme or isn't speaking to those
concerns he's not speaking those
concerns at all because he doesn't
actually believe in helping those people
he believes in being a [ __ ] Theo crap
so here you have Doug Jones come along
and again Doug Jones is gonna disappoint
us in many ways because he's a mansion
style Democrat Doug Jones come along and
yeah he actually will talk about those
issues it's in fact in his in his speech
after he won you know what one of the
things he said was when he's immediately
before I even get to Washington they
need to fund the chip program that's the
Children's Health Insurance Program
which by the way to give Hillary Clinton
credit on something which is rare on
this show she was instrumental in
getting chip in place one of the very
few positive things about her record but
that's what Doug Jones was saying he's
like okay fun the [ __ ] chip program
let's do it and then you wonder well why
is it that this came deep red Alabama
the Democrat one because the other guys
in accused pedophile he's a slavery
apologist and all he spoke about was the
socialist you see didn't offer people
anything on the economic populism front
anything he said bad economics was the
opposite not economically populist
economically elitist and look here's
here's my overall conclusion and this is
one that you know the centrists are
gonna [ __ ] go nuts when they hear me
say something like this but it's true
let's say Doug Jones ran exactly the
same campaign he did with two
differences he's for Medicare for all in
free college he would have won by 10
points not one not one or two
now again you see people centrist and
neo liberals hear that and they've
broken they melt down
but I've already seen it you have people
on Twitter Joe Manchin was already out
there saying well this is a win for the
radical Center radical Center [ __ ] out
of here
no it's a it's a win for the anti
pedophile vote is what it is but if he
were to be more economically populist
Doug Jones I think he would have won by
more now again you say well how can you
make that argument where's your evidence
to back that up
there's plethora of evidence and I
brought it up repeatedly for example in
the primary the 2016 primary bernie
sanders beat hillary clinton by a mile
and a half among people who describe
themselves as conservative democrats so
all the exit polls when they hey how do
you describe herself you liberal
democrat you moderate are you
conservative democrat it throughout the
midwest
people said oh i'm a conservative
democrat and they destroy he destroyed
hillary clinton among conservative
democrats now how's that possible
because Bernie's literally not more
conservative than Hillary he's to the
left of Hillary so it's a matter of
definitions and labels so how can
somebody say I'm more conservative but
you didn't vote for the more
conservative Democratic candidate
Hillary Clinton easy because people
don't [ __ ] think about labels they
don't really know about labels they say
what they think they are but at the end
of the day when you sit people down and
go hey I'm in favor of free college I'm
gonna favor Medicare for all I'm in
favor of a living wage I'm a favor of a
new New Deal I'm in favor of ending the
corruption those are things that cut
across party lines it's not it's not
hard to sell the idea of somebody I
think you should have a raise and I
think you should have health care that's
not a hard idea to sell so it's pure
fiction that in the minds of the
establishment they think well you have
to run a centrist II neo liberal II
right-wing Democrat in the deep red
states cuz that's the only way you're
gonna win nope
pure fiction pure fiction ideas like
Medicare for all free college living
wage new New Deal they cut across party
lines and again labels are something we
have you know when you think about these
issues forget the labels another example
of this is you had Bernie same
Peter's doing a town hall in the heart
of Trump country in West Virginia people
who [ __ ] voted for Trump and he got
them to cheer his agenda of
medicare-for-all free college living
wage I mean think about that a roomful
what's up [ __ ] welcome to the jungle
we go suck you balls
watchin write the background of this
Knicks Lakers ESPN oh [ __ ] yeah turn it
on also but I have to keep going back
and forth between CNN and then this
because the whole because there's an
Alabama special election going on right
now there's so much attention on that
[ __ ]
yeah it's cuz Jeff Sessions was the
senator from Alabama and now Jeff
Sessions is the Attorney General so they
got to fill that seat so it's Roy Moore
who's a pedophile fundamentalist
Christian versus insert anybody else
somebody who's not a pedophile hmm what
do I do here someone tweeted something
that was like oh it was that one guy
that you retweet her like can clip in
store and see an Alabama for like to
like just watch this all unfold yes he
went as a journalist for TYT lmao it's
crazy um but one of his things was like
something about Roy oh he saw a lady at
a bar and asked her about maybe the
other candidate or some [ __ ] and then
she was like I don't know anything about
him and then someone wrote in the
comment like does it matter some [ __ ]
like that like like like who cares what
are you like yeah so that's two like
there's so yes there's there's two
points to make about that in the case of
this election you do have somebody who's
a Christian fine he was removed Roy
Moore was removed twice from his job as
a judge in Alabama because he refused to
take down the Ten Commandments from his
courtroom look like dude you're and it's
what's so funny these are the same
people who pretend like they love the
Constitution meanwhile that's totally
unconstitutional to do that like you
can't do that with this isn't we don't
govern ourselves by [ __ ] Christian
biblical law like it's not the way this
country works so he refused to do that
he got removed as a judge twice for
doing that he said in the past he thinks
homosexuality should be illegal
he said God's law should override man's
law
I mean there's [ __ ] multiple
allegations of him you know
molesting [ __ ] 13 year olds 14 yes
and [ __ ] so like that's it's true like
this is one of those instances where
yeah you go one guy's a [ __ ]
pedophile fundamentalists and the other
guys literally anybody else it's like
okay that person's better so go vote for
him but you know it's everyday it's also
true though that if Roy Moore wins which
he might win one of the reasons is this
guy Doug Jones is all he has is he's not
Roy Moore going for him so in other
words like like there was there was an
account that was [ __ ] on Democratic
Socialist in Alabama who basically said
like listen I'm not I'm not gonna vote
in this election I'm not gonna vote for
Doug Jones because he's not for a $15
minimum wage or medicare-for-all and so
people were [ __ ] on that guy like
like boo [ __ ] you [ __ ] like what the
[ __ ] wrong with you but it's like no
why don't people say hey Doug maybe you
should be four or $15 minimum wage and
Medicare for all you can get this guy's
vote like it's always there's always
like shaming of people on the far left
who say no I kind of have very strict
standards I go by and I think to defend
those people a little bit that [ __ ] on
those people I think in their mind
they're saying well you know what he'll
lose voters if he goes for $15 minimum
wage or Medicare for all he'll lose
those voters in the middle but my whole
point then the point I've been trying to
make for so long is that's simply not
the case that's it because like take
Bernie Sanders for example he was going
to West Virginia and given town halls in
rooms full of Trump voters like
literally everybody in the room was a
trump voter and he made a room full of
Trump voters in West Virginia give a
standing ovation to Medicare for all and
a living wage and free college so it's
like the idea that like well obviously
you're gonna lose moderate voters if you
push for these ideas that's just not
true
like I know a lot of people think it's
true and they think that when I go after
doug jones and say oh you're not roy
more that's
you have going for you they interpret
that as me like [ __ ] on the guy when
a reality that's me saying like no dude
you can be a lot better if you do X Y &
Z because at the end of the day if I'm
in Alabama like I just said I'm voting
for Doug Jones there's no question about
it because because Roy Moore is that
[ __ ] bad yeah but the point is
instead of [ __ ] on the people who
say I'm not gonna bother to go vote why
don't you [ __ ] make them want to go
vote you know what I mean like make them
want to go vote yeah you know like you
for example you don't vote a lot like
sometimes you vote sometimes you don't
but like if like let's say for example
it was like I don't know if you voted in
this last election but if it was Bernie
Sanders I guarantee you you would have
voted yeah yeah exactly because you
because you go okay I know exactly what
that dude stands for and I know he's
gonna help me and I know he's gonna help
me I know he's gonna do the right thing
but that battle also have a platform to
get at Hillary and be like yo can you do
this I mean like it takes a lot more
which I mean is is sort of a cop-out but
it takes a lot more work to try and
start reaching out and like shoot like I
don't know joining a group to get
someone to like where do you even go
about doing that like okay here you go
was his name the dude running against
them Doug Jones Doug Jones like like if
I'm a gif I want him to be for something
woah how do I do that you know oh you're
saying had it like literally how you get
in contact with him or you're saying my
admit may say these things that both of
those things like well yeah I can want
him to like a certain thing but it's
just like to the latter question I have
an answer for the second part of that
which is you're their boss you're their
boss like and so like what you think
improves your law it would improve your
life for the government to do that's
what the government should be doing you
know what I mean like yeah it goes to
that bigger picture of like my wife
saying she won't shop at Hobby Lobby
because they don't like support this and
that and I'm like your dollars not gonna
make a [ __ ] difference whether or not
they're you know but I guess if
everybody has that suppose your wife
would argue it's the principle of the
thing yes that I'm not gonna [ __ ]
support this organization that's trying
to take away you know woman's ability to
get [ __ ] birth control through their
health insurance like I'm not going
and I think what she's doing is she's
saying she's acting on the principle of
if everybody acted like me in this
situation that Hobby Lobby wouldn't
exist anymore and everybody would be
better off you know I mean yeah so but I
you know I as a co-founder of Justice
Democrats a group that's primary the
corporate Democrats to try to get
Democrats actually believe in something
that are gonna fight for something i
100% understand the mindset of the
people like again i don't agree with
that person who said i'm not even gonna
bother to vote because of doug jones is
not good enough I don't agree with that
person but it's a similar to like a
Hillary Donald type of thing or a lot
yes it's very similar that it's very
similar to that that's exactly what this
is but you know I I understand that if
I'm in Alabama and those are my only two
choices you're gonna just be grudging I
would be grudgingly vote for Doug Jones
and say okay I don't like that that's
the point is if Doug Jones doesn't even
have to be good in this instance like
I'm gonna suck it up and and I would
vote for him but like at the same time
whenever people go after Doug Jones from
the left to try to hold them accountable
and make him be for better things like
stop people need to stop [ __ ] on
those people who are like no I really
want this guy to [ __ ] to help improve
everybody's life and they're like oh we
[ __ ] [ __ ] I guess you like ROI
more like no that's not what they're
saying not saying they like ROI more
they're saying that [ __ ] Doug Jones
needs to be serious here you saw that
you saw Charles Barkley was campaigning
for Doug I saw your tweet um and he was
just like stop stop acting like idiots
just I'm a big fan of Charles Barkley
like even though you said he
contradicted himself like in the
sentence right after it oh no he didn't
contradict himself
I was joking around and saying like oh
he then went on to say and I just mean
did he actually say that or not me
that's the thing I made it up but he
said it exactly because that's how like
Charles Barkley said when he was
campaigning
come on Alabama we need to show to the
world that were not a bunch of idiots
and I said they say I'd like that's a
good I like that style of campaigning
because he's just [ __ ] talking and
just being normal but then he goes on to
say I made up the next part I said he
goes on to say what the [ __ ] is wrong
with y'all do I need to take my belt off
hey you
see it saying that I won't resent saying
it and I was just like I respect them
for saying that ya know I like that what
did you I mean like people outside of
Alabama just have this perception of
Alabama people they're just like their
dumbest like they're not smart um
they're they're racist you know like all
this [ __ ] mm-hmm and if this guy wings
it's just gonna put the stamp of
approval on that [ __ ] and what's so
funny is that I I would imagine if you
talk to one of those people one of the
right-wingers in Alabama who's gonna
vote for Roy Moore I would imagine that
in their mind they're thinking like
we're voting for a guy who's gonna bust
up the establishment and help us like
that's how they're thinking like all
this guy he's he's just loud to me like
he's just like me I think it's more like
we're gonna do this because everybody
wants us to vote for the Democrat guy
yeah yeah yeah yeah that's a huge part
of it right like doing it to rebel
against what everybody wants yeah like
there's this big and they have that
thinking mindset of just like a child
where it's just like I'm being told not
to do this I'm gonna do it yeah it's the
mindset of like elections have been won
on the idea of I can't wait to trigger
the liberals like trigger their stupid
libs like I triggered you are you mad
it's like well yeah we're mad but like
now we're [ __ ]
it's like it's like they vote for
[ __ ] I saw a tweet about this it was
funny like they vote for face Ripper
monkey and then they're like I can't
believe the monkey ripped off my face
hey [ __ ] face Ripper monkey would you
expect and when liberals were like don't
do it don't do it it's like with a hot
stove somebody puts their hand on a hot
stove and they're like look at the
Liberals like and we're like don't don't
do that that's not a good idea and
they're like [ __ ] you and then they do
it I just have this perception of
Alabama people that I feel like if I
were to meet someone from Alabama which
maybe I have maybe haven't they they'd
be exactly what I think they are just
someone who's not like smart uneducated
whereas I think when we go abroad people
have that perception of like Americans
and just like that same Alabama mindset
but from what
seen my people I've spoken to like
they've they've heard that Americans are
nice like we could sort of flip that I
guess maybe because America is bigger
than Alabama I think your your first
point was right that people around the
country look at Alabama like oh you guys
are some backwoods Hicks [ __ ]
but then people in the world like people
in France look at people from the US
like you guys are some backwoods Hicks
[ __ ] yeah even if you're from
like California or some [ __ ] they look
at America like like you know like
[ __ ] America yeah yeah it's a lot
it's a lot of weird [ __ ] man that goes
into like what makes a Republican from
Alabama Republican from Alabama I mean a
lot of it's probably like that was like
the hub of slavery in America like that
was literally the hub of slavery yeah it
was like the biggest slave market and so
you have I don't know a culture that was
kind of rooted in fundamentalist
Christianity and racism and it's you
know the room just goes to like
education right yeah that's a huge part
of it is like I mean if you were to go
to like an elementary school in Alabama
like it's not the same [ __ ] as like they
don't school in New York you know like
you're not are you think they're
learning about Martin Luther King jr.
and like all this [ __ ] like you're
making me talk about black people you're
making a great point because I remember
I think all the way back in like 2014 I
covered a story on secular talk about in
this case it was the textbooks in a in a
public school in Texas I think it was
and no they don't teach it they don't
teach it at all like like it's taught in
most of the rest of the country they
teach it like you know War of Northern
Aggression as opposed to the Civil War
yeah and they're not teaching it they're
you know they're teaching I think the
story I covered was they almost totally
avoided the New Deal and FDR because
that was like you know the Social
Democratic president who's viewed is
like one of the best presidents in US
history and he took us out of the
depression and all that they ignore that
and they go to Reagan and talk about how
Reagan is the best and Reagan is
wonderful and it's like yeah they'll
they'll [ __ ] they'll try to teach
creationism alongside evolution and act
like like hey some people think this
some people think that in fact Roy Moore
he covered the story the other day he
was talking about how he says drive-by
shootings are done because we teach kids
evolution like oh they think they come
from animals so they act like animals
yeah so it's it's a lot of it has to do
with education a lot of has to add
cultural reasons a lot of has to do with
religious fundamentalism yeah it's just
a weird brew of things and think about
how bizarre it is that like Donald Trump
is is like a [ __ ] like a demigod to a
lot of these people to like Republicans
in Alabama like that's their boy like
they donít Trump is like like coach the
more novices from them yeah then that's
the point is like Donald Trump you won't
talk about
he's like an elitist rich dude born with
a silver spoon in his mouth from New
York like you know how they always scoff
it god damn cultural elites look down
their nose at us in New York so I guess
that [ __ ] battle Trump you're
describing Donald Trump that's what he
is like he was a dude that came he's
like financially well-off came from a
rich dad [ __ ] hand to everything his
entire life went bankrupt seven times
[ __ ] is a big-time adulterer and
philanderer
you know like it was it was in Playboy a
bunch of times like this is the guy that
if Barack Obama had the same resume as
Donald Trump went bankrupt seven times
appeared in a few softcore porn so to be
fair he wasn't but like you know was a
shady [ __ ] businessman refused to
release his tax returns like all those
things if Obama did that I mean they
they had to make [ __ ] up about Obama to
try to make him seem even more far in an
evil like oh he was born in Kenya yeah
yeah I tried getting a more like a
practical level like if Donald Trump
were to go into just like a random bar
in Alabama like not being the president
yeah super rich guy from New York I feel
in a weird way he'd he'd get the
attention from the people in the bar and
they'd sort of like him just because you
know they felt maybe because I don't
know this is my perception that they're
not very smart in Alabama that they
would just be like maybe we're gonna get
some money from this guy and then like
they'd sort of befriend him just because
like he
looked wealthy and all this [ __ ] whereas
like a normal newer person come in there
they might not [ __ ] with him that much
is because like yeah we're not gonna get
anything from from this guy don't I
don't like the way he rubs off on me
well Bill Maher made an interesting
point about that he's like everybody
from New York has a friend that's like
Donald Trump he's the guy who you're
talking about him with something and
then he'll be like listen I know a guy I
could get you an amazing deal you go see
my guy I'll give you his number he's
amazing like everybody knows that guy in
New York but in New York we more brush
that guy off because we know he's just a
[ __ ] he's a [ __ ] con artist he's
just a guy who's a joke feels insecure
tries to be friends with people but he's
not really friends with anybody but he
tries to act like he's friends with
people and I know people I can get you
things like but but in that time in
desperate times we've been in those I've
been in those situations where I'd lead
it maybe a guy or some [ __ ] I'm just
like I gotta hit up this person and see
if his [ __ ] connect could come through
so it's like and just four times use you
sometimes have no one really to turn to
and you're like there's always that guy
and that could be that guy that's a
metaphor for the country you know it's
those desperate times people are
struggling and they're like let's roll
the dice on this [ __ ] because we know
what Hilary's gonna give us that's the
same old [ __ ] but to your point about
the people in Alabama and maybe you're
right that if Trump were to walk into a
brand Ambala not being the president
random dude but instead of looking at
him like oh he's a [ __ ] elitist from
New York like they might look at him
like oh I kind of want to be like him
he's wearing a suit
and he's [ __ ] he he's telling people
what to do
and they'll look at that like I like
that he's boss over here yeah he's just
like me you know in a weird way that was
a tweet story had just how they want to
be that was a tweet storm I read the
other day on the show after the election
there's this dude who's a gay
mexican-american who grew up in rural
Oklahoma around almost all white people
and he did it was a tweet storm saying
why he thinks Donald Trump won and it
was brilliant because he laid out
everything he laid out like you know how
people feel like poverty if they're in
poverty in Alabama they feel like it's
some sort of moral
failing on their part like I must be a
bad person on some level that I don't
make a lot of money like I failed so
when they look at Donald Trump they
don't see a guy who's rich because he
like got a handed down from his daddy
and because he exploited the [ __ ] out of
people when he ran his businesses they
look at that guy is like [ __ ] he must be
really moral and really smart because
he's rich so that's what I that's what I
could be if it wasn't for all these
[ __ ] Mexicans and black people
holding me back yeah that's how they
that's the thought process you know and
whether it's conscious or here's a
different question but on some level
that's how they're thinking that you
there's a twitter user named JP Brammer
and he's a an LGBTQ mexican-american who
grew up in Oklahoma and in fact I think
it was a rural Oklahoma he said he
mostly lived around white people so
that's an interesting situation to be in
if you're an LGBTQ mexican-american
growing up around mostly white people in
rural Oklahoma I mean that's Wow
that's got to be an eye-opening
experience but somebody sent this to me
on Twitter and I apologize for not
remembering who's the one who sent it to
me but he did a tweet storm after the
election that broke down Trump's appeal
in a way that I think is honestly the
most accurate and spot-on attempt to
discuss the the Trump phenomenon so let
me show you what he said here he starts
off by saying so I'm a mexican-american
from a poor rural mostly white town in
Oklahoma missing from this debate how
poor whites see themselves so let's
pause just to reflect on the fact that
you usually get two camps when it comes
to hey why did Trump win one camp says
and this is usually the people who are
more tied in with establishment
Democrats and more on the side of
Hillary Clinton they usually say it was
just the racism and the bigotry and the
sexism and the xenophobia that's what
that's why he won and notice that's kind
of a convenient argument for them
because then they get to blame Trump
winning on the inherent shittiness of
everybody who voted for him so it
absolves them of not winning over the
people they needed to win over because
you go
and then whatever their [ __ ] bad
people anyway their shitty people so
what we gonna do so that's the one piece
of the puzzle is she's racist and sexist
and bigots and all that but then the
other piece of the puzzle and this is
you know people who are more more Bernie
supporters would say well no it's not
that it's that he did do
anti-establishment rhetoric he did rail
against trade he did say he was gonna
look out for workers all he did was talk
against TPP in the rallies in the
during the end of the election at the
end of the election in the Rust Belt and
then guess what he won the Rust Belt
anyone the presidency even though he
lost popular vote so it was the economic
populism which is why you won well I
think JP Brammer does a good job here so
he's gonna say and this is an argument
that I've made it's both things some
plenty of people voted for him because
he's a bigot and they agreed with those
bigoted policies but then there are many
people who overlooked his bigotry and
said I think he might bust up the
establishment which I want somebody to
do and I think he might look out for my
job and protected from being outsourced
there are people who voted for Obama
twice that then voted for Trump you
can't just call them races and sexes and
bigots because they're not that's not
true but the answer is both
so it's both of those things is why
Trump won some people voted for the
anti-establishment reason some people
voted because he's a bigot I mean David
Duke he's like yeah he hates brown
people too so - I well JP Brammer puts
this even more in perspective he
continues quote if you're wondering how
poor exploited white people could vote
for a dude with a golden elevator who
will [ __ ] them over here's how they
don't see themselves as poor they don't
base their identity on it they see
themselves as temporarily embarrassed
millionaires this stigma against poverty
is incredibly strong it is shameful to
be poor to not have the comforts of the
middle class so they pretend that they
aren't poor they are willing to lie to
make it seem like they aren't poor they
purchase things to make it seem like
they're not in my town wealth wasn't
associated with greed but with hard work
and inherent goodness you are blessed if
you have material wealth when they see
Trump they don't see an extortionist who
is rich because of the very conditions
that keep their own communities in
poverty they see someone who worked hard
and was justly rewarded with wealth most
men especially think they could - they
too could be Trump were it not for the
unfair obstacles put in their way white
men who don't consider themselves
successful enough
so many excuses for their failures the
idea that immigrants are the reason they
are poor and not wealthy like Trump is
so appealing it takes all the shame and
blame away and here we have a man who
they think tells it like it is and is
willing to name the things stealing
prosperity out of their hands
if these people saw themselves as an
exploited class of people if American
culture didn't stigmatize poverty so
much it might be different but America
has so entangled wealth and goodness and
poverty with moral deficiency that they
can't build that identity they won't
Trump is rich and so according to
American criteria he is also wise fair
moral deserving strong clever he has to
be capitalism and the American Dream
teach that poverty is a temporary state
that can be transcended with hard work
and cleverness to fail to transcend
poverty and to admit you are poor is to
admit you are neither hard-working nor
clever its cultural brainwashing so if
an exploited class of people don't want
to admit they're exploited and they
blame themselves for their oppression
what manifests xenophobia hatred of
anyone who is different queer people
people of color these people are eroding
the goodness of America and if they
would just stop just stop ruining
America then the perfect design of
America could work again and deliver
prosperity I'm telling you as someone
who has spent almost his entire life in
this environment that if you think
cities are a bubble good god but the
reality is of course that these people
are indeed exploited and they are
victims even while they victimize others
victimized us how you balance those
realities and what conclusions you reach
to improve the lives of both well I'm
not smart enough to have the answer yes
you are smart enough to have the answer
because that was a brilliant brilliant
tweet storm there and it takes that last
missing piece of the
puzzle that I haven't vocalized I have
been put it into words and expressed it
maybe at times I have in other stories
but this really put a front and center
and I had the lightbulb effect I went oh
that's right that's the final little
missing piece which is the stigma of
poverty and you see this across the
board in the u.s. it's definitely really
heavy in Republican circles if you're
poor you're a bad person to them that's
your fault
that's your oh you're you're poor I
don't care the other facts that go
hand-in-hand with that what that shows
is a sign of immorality it shows that
you're not a hard-working decent
American this is why they cut all the
social safety net programs and they feel
totally fine in doing that because they
think well that money those people don't
deserve that money they don't deserve it
this is a handout this is not in attempt
to alleviate extreme poverty that's
that's in existence because of the
nature of the system that exploits them
and [ __ ] them over no they view it as
we're giving these people and unfair
hand up and we're breeding dependence
for them to stay on these programs and
it it chips away at their moral fiber
and if they're not wealthy it's because
they're not good people and we look at
rich people and we go oh that must be
because they're they're a genius they're
clever they're intelligent they're the
most moral they know the most stuff I
mean look at how even a guy like Mark
Cuban who's not smart he's just not
smart but they treat him like ah mark
Mark Cuban couldn't figure out [ __ ]
net neutrality you know he said dude you
don't want big government [ __ ]
control in the inner the [ __ ] you
talk about so he's with
he's the only person in the country who
agrees with algid pie cuz he's not that
smart he didn't figure I he's not that
smart but because he has a lot of money
people go oh is more Cuban gonna run
against Donald Trump but the foot why
what are you talking about or the rock
the rock who's a movie star by the way I
like the rock so nothing against the
rock personally but the idea that when
we know nothing about what his policy
beliefs are the idea that the media
would say well I know the rock should
run against why why because he's rich
he's a megastar
and he's rich and you know him he must
be good he's got a shitload of money
must be good the goldman sachs [ __ ]
over the entire country these are people
it's been proven that they would sell
packages to unsuspecting clients that
were full of the toxic subprime
mortgages they knew that these packages
were [ __ ] and that eventually the that
they would tank but they sold it to
people and said hey you know you need to
get on this because you're gonna make a
lot of money if you get involved with
these packages here if you invest so
unsuspecting people did that because
they thought goldman sachs were experts
and they got hosed
so goldman sachs committed fraud they
knew this product was shitty they sold
it as if it was good they made money off
those people and they don't see the
problem is and you still have the CEO of
goldman sachs lloyd blankfein
public figure everybody he's uninvited
on CNBC yay tell us what you think about
x y&z Steve minuchin Gary Cohn people
from Goldman Sachs in the Trump
administration writing the tax plan
writing the tax plan controlling our
government policy in what world does it
make sense that these people are proven
frauds and criminals but now polite
society shoes Moo look Goldman Sachs you
must be an expert talk to me because
they're rich because they're rich if
you're rich or moral I don't care how
you got the money I don't care about the
backstory I don't give a [ __ ] if you
exploited everybody in their mother in
the process I don't give a [ __ ] it
you run but like you know Walmart for
example or something where they keep
their [ __ ] workers on starvation
wages they don't pay a living wage they
don't pay a living wage if they make
billions in profits they pay people less
than they can live on but if you're the
CEO or something Hillary was on wall
much Walmart's board but they treat her
Oh Hillary Clinton tell me about things
you know stuff
she was exploiting the [ __ ] out of
people we have an economy that feeds off
the exploitation of poor workers and
even middle-class workers you're
exploiting these people some of the
hardest-working people I know are in
poverty
I know people who work two jobs three
jobs they sleep [ __ ] five hours a
night four hours a night not to get up
super old bust ass bust ass they work
harder than any [ __ ] CEO I've ever
seen but they make one you know they
make the CEO makes eighty times more
than they do hundred times more three
hundred times more how could that be
because the system is built on
exploitation but deep in American
culture is this notion if you're poor
it's your fault pull yourself up by your
bootstraps but if only Americans would
understand it's not your fault say are
there some people who are lazy and
choose to be lazy and so they don't make
a lot of money I'm sure I'm sure there's
some out there but the overwhelming
majority of people are doing their
absolute best to keep their head above
water and it's the nature of the system
that keeps them down because it's not a
system that's fair it's not a system
that's a meritocracy the fundamental
idea in the minds of these poor people
who voted for Trump is the country's
already a meritocracy so he made it to
the top of it so we got to respect him
because he knows stuff we don't he has
to be brilliant and clever and the most
moral but no well you don't understand
is the system isn't anywhere near a
meritocracy power
Hylton is massively rich how did she get
that she's a genius know the [ __ ]
inherited wealth Donald Trump's dad was
worth 400 million dollars
he slides and says I got a small loan of
a million dollars first of all small
loan of a million ours I know people who
would die for a small loan of a million
dollars but second of all that was
before his dad died when his dad died he
got way more than that born with a
silver spoon in his mouth he went
bankrupt I think it was over seven times
all these are bankrupt bankrupt bankrupt
bankrupt have you ever gone bankrupt No
so at least in one sense you're a much
better businessman than Donald Trump
so the notion of being wealthy meaning
you're more moral you're more clever
it's just objectively not true there are
many billionaires who are [ __ ] idiots
there are and there are many people who
are super poor who are geniuses there's
many people who are super poor who are
more hard-working than some CEO who sits
on his ass look at what happened with
Wall Street they bankrupted their
companies crash the world economy then
they got bailed out they got bailed out
and then they paid bonuses to the people
who made the decisions that bankrupted
their companies and crash the economy so
see how it's rigged you do well here's a
bonus here's a tremendous amount of
money you crash the economy and you
bankrupt your company here's the money
anyway so there's no way you can look at
the system and say oh this is [ __ ] a
meritocracy this they're the smartest
they're the that's why they have all the
money no no they rigged the process big
business bought the government they
rigged the process in their favor
against the middle class and against the
poor but if you are infected with that
ideology well obviously Trump is
brilliant because he's he won he won at
this game because he's the most clever
he's the most moral he's the most
intelligent well you just been had
you've been took because that's not true
so he
you have a guy who's thrived on
exploiting you he Donald Trump committed
fraud with Trump the Trump University he
called it a university it wasn't a
university he promised you would make
people out of money it did make people a
lot of money he had people who were
known con men teaching the class people
who were it had gone to prison for being
con men they did classic tricks up
selling oh I know you paid however much
to get in here five hundred dollars but
now you got to pay another five hundred
if you really want the secrets its
exploitation its fraud he literally had
to pay out millions of dollars because
it was fraud and some people think all
this guy's a genius who's just harder
working than ever no he's a billionaire
exploiting people alleged billionaire
exploiting people so that's a great
point
so Trump's appeal yes there are the
people who love Trump because he's a
bigot and he was kind of open about that
there are people who love Trump because
they thought he would be
anti-establishment and bust up the
system that's definitely part of it as
well
they thought hey maybe I'll keep my job
in the country because he's talking
against trade and all that but then the
other piece of the puzzle is there are a
lot of people who look at a guy like
Trump and because of the cultural
brainwashing that anybody who's rich has
to be the hardest-working has to be the
most moral has to be the best because of
that cultural brainwashing and the fact
that Trump acts like that's the case I
am the most tremendous unbelievable they
fell for it hook line and sinker and if
there was some sort of class class
consciousness and if people understood
everybody who's middle class and poor
struggling and it's time for us to come
together to fight the rich if they
understood that then there's no way he
would have gotten elected the oldest
trick in the book is rich elites hitting
the middle class against the poor and
usually it's middle class white people
against poor people of color it doesn't
have to be but oftentimes that's the
case or it's even poor white people
against poor people of color
and you escape goat you say oh those
[ __ ] immigrants are the reason that
you're you're in trouble for the [ __ ]
Muslims are the reason there these are
the people holding you back and then
they run out the back door with all the
money blame people who have no money and
no power run out the back door with all
the money rig the rig the economy in
their favor
and then all the while sell to you know
I'm at this top position in society
because I worked so hard and I'm so
moral and clever and genius and
brilliant it's all [ __ ] it's time
for working-class people middle-class
people poor people to band together and
to realize the same policies would help
us all Medicare for all living wage free
college strong unions ending the wars
reinvesting in our infrastructure at
home those things help everybody so it's
time to sell that vision and to break
free of the cultural brainwashing that
led people to believe well obviously
Trump's a genius because he's rich
he's not and that's the truth
let me show you how shameless the
Republicans are Ryan eyes push for
entitlement reform in 2018 they just
finished saying they weren't gonna do
this they just finished saying that we
covered the story of Bernie calling out
the Senate Republicans you know and
Marco Rubio for example like no no
listen up we're not gonna do that and
the reason why we're not going to I mean
listen I have a mom and my mom wouldn't
let me come back home to Florida and go
in the house if I go after the Social
Security and the Medicare so no another
Republican was like Bernie there's no
secret plan here we don't have Medicare
and Social Security mentioned in this
budget bill so I don't know why you're
fear-mongering
I mean if we want it to do it we could
do it now we're going through Budget
Reconciliation which means you only need
fifty one votes to pass our tax plan so
if we wanted to cut Medicare and Social
Security why wouldn't we just do it now
these are the arguments that they made
but Bernie's response was listen you're
not that dumb you're terrible for the
American people but you're clever with
it you're sly with it in how your
[ __ ] people over so Bernie's argument
was you know you're gonna do you're
gonna pass this tax cut bill which adds
any anywhere from one trillion to one
point four trillion dollars to the
deficit so you're liars by the way about
oh-oh-oh so much we spend within our
means you gotta live within our means
and you're getting [ __ ] dumping all
this debt our grandchildren debt all the
debt oh and then when they think
nobody's looking anyway pass that bill
that adds a trillion to one point four
trillion to the debt what happened I
thought you were fiscal conservatives
fiscal Hawks and you have discipline no
you and you wanted to add even more to
it but then Bernie laid out as soon as
they passed that they're gonna turn
around in a little bit and go up the
[ __ ] deficit do you guys believe this
look at this
anyway we need to get this house in
order so we have to we don't have a
choice we have to cut Social Security
and Medicare and they won't phrase it
like that what they'll do is they'll say
we have to reform it
that's a reform we're not cutting it
we're reforming it we're saving it
that's another one that you say we're
saving it so what they want to do some
of their ideas are hey raise the
retirement age but raise it for people
who are 55 and under now so in other
words people some people are
grandfathered in to the way Social
Security works
but then we [ __ ] over everybody who's
below a certain age that's their trick
[ __ ] yeah chuckles everybody who's below
certain age or they're gonna try to like
semi-private eyes and remember Bush
tried and I think it was 2004 to
privatize social Social Security and
Medicare so they want to try something
similar to that there'll be a heavy onus
on or you know they'll focus on private
accounts to one extent or another
because what they want to do is take
that money and turn it over to their
friends on Wall Street who give them
campaign contributions and they want to
invest it in the marketplace well that's
just so that their Wall Street cronies
can get a cut of your money and also
let's face it how volatile of an idea is
that can you imagine putting this money
that supposed to be guaranteed into a
casino capitalist market place where
there's peaks and valleys and it goes up
and down and what it's not like we
haven't we had a [ __ ] Great
Depression we had a Great Recession
we're in a bubble right now and you want
to take everybody's you know retirement
money and just [ __ ] it gamble with it no
we don't want that but they're gonna do
that and they're gonna hide behind the
idea
no we're saving the program because it's
unsustainable right now but that's
nonsense that's they say it's
unsustainable but then you crunch the
numbers on it it turns out it's totally
solvent until like twenty thirty eight
and then even after twenty thirty eight
it pays out like eighty-five percent of
its benefits you know all you would need
to do to fix Social Security forever
it's just raised the cap on
the money that's taxable so right now
you're only taxed for Social Security on
your first I think it's a hundred and
fifteen thousand dollars so that means
that let's say there's a let's say
there's a dentist that makes one hundred
and fifteen thousand dollars he pays the
exact same amount in Social Security tax
as Mitt Romney who makes fifteen million
dollars a year the same amount exact
same amount of tax because it's only
your first like a hundred and fifteen
thousand dollars that you're taxed on
for Social Security if you just get rid
of that cap
well then Mitt Romney would pay way more
in Social Security tax it be the same
percentage but it would be way more
money because he has fifteen million not
one hundred and fifteen thousand so then
that's it
Social Security's taken care of but
they're not considering that at all
that's an idea of Bernie's push before
that's an idea that other actual
progressives have pushed before they're
not considering that at all
that's not at all they're saying no
let's raise the retirement age and let's
like semi privatize this thing Oh God so
but Paul Ryan is even more upfront about
it he had a moment of honesty on a radio
show this week here's what he said quote
we're gonna have to get back next year
we're gonna have to we're going to have
to get back next year at entitlement
reform which is how you tackle the debt
and the deficit health care entitlements
such as Medicare Medicaid are the
biggest drivers of the debt so we spend
more time on health care entitlements
because that's really where the problem
lies fiscally speaking I find it amazing
that people actually talk about the
mainstream media talked about Paul Ryan
like he's some sort of intellectual
she's not some sort of intellectual he
has the same answer to everything
Oh cut the programs that help regular
people because you know that's where the
problem lies
fiscally speaking and the media's like
huh oh he said fiscally speaking oh he's
so smart what an intellectual he's the
guy who never got out of his eyen rand
phase that's what he is in in like high
school or college year
many white boys go through a nine ran
phase where they come up with this
worldview this vision this philosophy
actually selfishness is a good thing
greed is a good thing but most people
you know get out of that phase not Paul
Ryan Paul Ryan still in that phase the
biggest problem is health care spent
what are we gonna do entitlements by the
way you know why they're called
entitlements because you're entitled to
it cuz you paid into the program and
then you're gonna get out of the program
which is why entitlements I'm in a good
word because it has the feeling of it's
like something you didn't earn no you
did earn it it's called entitlement
because you are entitled to it but
that's why the real terminology should
be earned benefit because it doesn't
even have the feeling of oh you're
getting something you didn't earn it's
an earned benefit program you paid into
it your whole life you're gonna get out
of it but what they're trying to do is
say no you paid into it but you're not
gonna get out of it you're gonna get out
of it a lot less than what you're
supposed to get out of it and then just
the notion that it's the big drivers of
the debt man I mean come on it's the big
drivers in the debt what are we gonna do
they never would ever say that about
areas where we actually waste money the
United States spends more on military
spending than the next nine biggest
spending countries combined and most of
those countries are our allies the
amount of money we spend on the military
we have the largest military ever
created in human history and Paul Ryan
he doesn't say we need to cut that in
fact he's in favor of raising that he
wants to spend even more on our empire
but when it comes to [ __ ] health care
for grandmas and grandpas and when it
comes to money so that you can survive
when you're in your old age we gotta cut
that's the biggest drivers of the debt
why haven't you said hey maybe we spend
a hundred billion dollars a year to
maintain nine hundred military bases
Paul Ryan why wouldn't you say at the
very least you know I think we could get
by with 450 military bases we don't need
900 I think we could say fifty billion
dollar
up front just like that why haven't you
said that why haven't you said you know
ExxonMobil
they get a four billion dollar corporate
welfare check every year it's a giant
subsidy from the taxpayers to exxon
mobil and we say oh we're giving it to
them for research and development they
need to do research and develop why do
they need money for research and
development they're one of those
profitable corporations in the world why
are you not saying hey we need to get
rid of the corporate welfare for exxon
mobil we give eighty billion dollars a
year to the big banks why are you not
saying Oh what are we doing here why are
we giving money the big banks I thought
you were a pure capitalist it turns out
you're in favor of socialism but only
when it's further rich and when it's for
the corporations so what you really are
is a corporatist that's what you are why
are you not trying to cut that I mean
the amount of money the Iraq war seven
trillion dollars it's gonna cost when
all is said and done seven trillion
dollars again he has nothing to say
nothing to say about the fact that we're
still in Iraq we're still in Afghanistan
were in Syria Pakistan Yemen Somalia
Libya and now there's one more what's
the other one Niger so there's eight
countries that we're in he's not saying
oh come on the military spending I mean
it might be the biggest driver of the
debt nope would never say it because the
money by the way there's discretionary
and non-discretionary spending so in
other words they have theirs
those are two separate categories for a
reason so Medicare and Social Security
is viewed as well that's kind of over
here in its own thing now why would they
do that well they do that because again
earned benefit programs you paid into it
you're getting out of it so that's money
that's coming right back to you now what
they want to do is they want to take
that money and slash left and right not
give you back your own money but the
money that doesn't come back to you they
want to keep paying that out when you do
massive Wall Street bailouts
that money's going into into literally
for bonuses to some CEOs bank account
even though he bankrupted the [ __ ]
company but they're bailing him out now
are you gonna see that money you're not
gonna see that money you do see the
money for Social Security or Medicare
you don't see it in that situation
do you see the money when it [ __ ]
blows up over some innocent families
house in Syria when we attack you don't
see that money guess what when you spend
money on bombs it goes kablooey and
blows up and then you don't get that
money back he wants to keep that money
that's fine spend that blank check for
that but social Social Security Medicare
that we gotta cut they just pushed a tax
bill that adds up to one point four
trillion to the deficit and they're
doing that by getting rid of the estate
tax which applies to the richest point
two percent of people by getting rid of
dividends taxes so they're slashing
taxes for rich people and corporations
they're raising taxes on the middle
class and the poor according to the CBO
Congressional Budget Office everybody
who makes $75,000 a year or less you're
gonna get your taxes raised over the
next decade so they're adding to the
deficit raising taxes on regular people
and they want to turn around and cut
your Social Security and Medicare it's
unreal these guys are [ __ ] pirates
man they're pirates they're waging a
class war they can you imagine being so
disgusting and brazen that you just
supported a bill that adds one point
four trillion dollars to the deficit and
now you turn around and go the [ __ ]
deficit why is the deficit so high I
guess we have to cut programs for
regular people you just pushed the tax
bill that cuts taxes for the rich
massively here's an idea you want to
address the deficit and the debt
stop cutting taxes for the rich stop
stop stop stop stop stop stop if you
just don't do that
the deficit in the debt would be much
better off but no there's well that's a
given we have to cut taxes for the rich
and corporations obviously [ __ ]
obviously but they'll avoid are we gonna
do we got to cut health care Social
Security and Medicare we got to cut that
preys in listen if you're somebody who
votes Republican or voted Republican
there's one thing I want you to know
that's not debatable this is it's not a
question it's not like wow what's your
opinion on said matter they're not
looking out for you if you're a regular
person if you're middle-class if you're
poor if you're upper-middle class [ __ ]
95 percent of the American people maybe
99 percent they marry people they don't
care about you they don't care about you
in any way that's what I want you to
know that's what I want you to know so
there are some people out there who
think for whatever reason they were
raised in a family that's Republican or
they don't follow the news closely or
whatever but there are some people out
there who think no the Republicans
really are the party of the little guy
they're the party of the average Joe and
they think that for a variety of reasons
and propaganda that's been pervasive for
a long time like for example many of
these people think oh the Republicans
want to cut my taxes they want to cut my
taxes so the Republicans want me to keep
more of my money the Democrats want to
take more of my money
therefore the Republicans are the party
is looking out for me there are people
who believe this guy's I just want to
let you know that well I want those
people are know I'm speaking directly to
those people you've been had you've been
took you've been played for a chump the
good news is you don't have to keep
falling for it because now you know the
information now you know that according
to the Congressional Budget Office when
you look at the tax bill it raises taxes
on people making $75,000 a year or less
by the way so there's all the tax cuts
for the middle class there's a sunset
provision on it and it runs out you know
where there's not a sunset provision
taxes for corporations in the rich
those are permanent yours hey we'll give
you a little boost up front but then we
raise your taxes you see what the
doing so I just want you to know they
don't care about you
they despise you they're not looking out
for you but now you know that so don't
don't get fooled by their nonsense and
let's be clear this isn't me saying the
Democrats are good they're not they're
not good to a large extent their
corporate sellouts as well but just know
the Republicans are even worse they're
even worse they're more grotesque and
they want to go further and screwing you
over and doing the bidding of their rich
donors so don't get fooled don't don't
get fooled by it now there's no excuse
I've given you all the information this
is what they want to do every program
that you rely on you know you need your
money let's face it you need your money
if you're in the middle class you got
bills to pay well just know the
Republicans want to cut every program
that helps you and also raise your taxes
so just keep that in mind the next time
you go vote
the Democratic Party unity and Reform
Commission wrapped up recently and the
results are interesting so first of all
probably the most important issue that
they resolved is that they're calling
for effectively reducing the number of
super-delegates by 60% but then also
requiring that the remaining
super-delegates vote in line with their
respective states so what they're what
they're trying to do is effectively get
rid of super-delegates but they didn't
get rid of them in a more at least
they're not calling for getting rid of
them and named so it's effectively
reducing the number of super-delegates
sixty percent and then requiring the
remaining ones to vote with their
respective states listen if it was up to
me I would have said just get rid of the
super-delegates I don't know see I mean
it's a step in the right direction but
there's almost this is exactly the kind
of half-measure nonsense that you would
expect when half the panel is
establishment Democrats you know it's
like well we're gonna well take a step
in the right direction because god
forbid we go 100 percent in the right
direction I mean let's not be silly here
let's keep everything in perspective and
at least remain a little bit shitty no
just go all the way what the [ __ ] what
are you doing so again I don't want to
[ __ ] on that too much because it is I
mean if they're effectively tying the
hands of the super-delegates and thereby
eliminating them then we shouldn't
complain too much so it is a good thing
but I'm just saying it why wouldn't you
just go all the way and totally
eliminate them it just seems weird and
it seems like you know it's almost like
you're doing the right thing effectively
but in name you're doing the wrong thing
so it's almost like you're inviting
people to in the grassroots to say why
you [ __ ] you why are you still hanging
on to them why are you still keeping
them by name the Republicans don't even
have super-delegates the Democrats have
super-delegates super-delegates are by
definition on democratic so again what
they're trying
do is say we're gonna make them
democratic now we're gonna eliminate 60%
of them and require the remaining ones
to vote as there's told to vote by the
people but it's just why the [ __ ]
half measure even though it's a step in
the right direction another thing there
they want is to require absentee voting
and mandatory vote counts and caucuses
so this is these are just unquestionably
good because absentee votes in a caucus
one of the big problems with caucuses
people point out is if you can't be
there physically well then you don't get
to participate you have to be there
physically and you know the timing
doesn't mesh with some people and it's
difficult and as you know this country
we don't take voting we don't treat
voting the way it should be treated most
places it's a national holiday where you
get off so you can go vote here in the
US we don't it's not a national holiday
so it's almost like they're trying to
suppress the vote just by virtue of the
way the system works so what they're
calling for is no four caucuses now
because by the way they control the
caucuses they don't control the
primaries that's the way it works but
for so for the caucuses which they
control they're saying we want absentee
voting and mandatory vote counts and
caucuses because before I know it sounds
weird but we didn't have mandatory vote
counts and caucuses before which is like
what that's strange
so that's a step in the right direction
they also want to encourage States to
allow same-day party and voter
registration in primaries now again they
don't control the primaries so they
can't even really do that but we all
know the horrendous state of affairs it
because in the in the last primary for
example in New York if you wanted to
vote let's say you're an independent or
let's say you're a Republican but it's
the Democratic primary and you want to
vote for Bernie Sanders
well you're [ __ ] because you would
have had to switch your party like six
months before the election like what
it's insanity it's it's biased on
purpose in favor of the establishment
Democratic candidate that's what that is
and listen I
have anecdotal stories that show how
devastating a rule like that is my
brother-in-law was a registered
Republican Bernie Sanders came along
he's like I want to vote for this guy
well guess what it was too late for him
to switch parties so he wasn't able to
vote in the Democratic primary boom
there's a vote for Bernie down the drain
when I went to go vote for Bernie in the
primary I'm standing in line somebody
comes up and says hey listen I don't
remember if I'm registered as an
independent or a Democrat but I'd like
to cast a vote here well they looked it
up he was registered as an independent
that was overwhelmingly likely another
guy who was gonna vote for Bernie
Sanders to be fair I don't know for sure
but you know all the statistics show
Bernie did amazingly among independents
but when you shut the independents out
of the process you make it much more
likely the establishment Democrat is
gonna win and then when you also make it
so that you would have to switch parties
six months before the race nobody's
gonna remember to do that nobody knows
that so that's it this is a direct
attempt to try to get states like New
York which were so horrendous on this
front they're saying listen we want you
to do same-day party and voter
registration and primaries now since
they don't control the primaries how are
they gonna try to get them to do that
they're gonna dock their delegates if
they don't do that so in other words
they could try to incentivize them to do
that and that's what that is they're
gonna try to incentivize them to do
same-day party and voter registration so
that's definitely a good thing and then
also they want to create in Ombudsman
Council that's always a funny word that
I have troubles like to quote
impartially review and address any
complaints or recommended or recommend
improvements around questions of
fairness neutrality and transparency at
the party this was a big issue you had a
lack of transparency with how the DNC
money is spent you had you know a
billion dollars spent and it was flushed
down the toilet because you lost to the
biggest monster and most disliked
candidate in US history Donald trum
and the DNC's doesn't show how the money
spent so well how are we supposed to fix
the problem how are we supposed to move
in the right direction how are we
supposed to win if you don't allow
budget transparency and allow people to
say oh ok you did that now that's a
[ __ ] mistake and we shouldn't go down
that road by the way remember the the
Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee letter that we discussed
recently where the d-triple-c is trying
to make candidates force them to unify
they say oh you can't push any you can't
use any arguments that are gonna harm
them harm us in a general well they also
are mandating that's like 75% of the
funds go to TV ads well see this is the
problem because you guys have this old
model that you use in order to win
elections but your models have sucked
from the year 2000 and onward you don't
know what you're doing you're terrible
at it
all these Democratic strategists get
together in a smoke-filled back room and
they go well we know how to win we're
gonna run further to the right and we're
gonna force the money to be spent on
things that are ineffective and so what
they're saying here is we need to create
a council that overlooks that can
address complaints recommend
improvements and it makes sure that that
the DNC is being fair the DNC is being
neutral in a primary and also there's
transparency and budget transparency so
we know what the [ __ ] money is being
spent on so they recommended the
creation of an ombudsman Council to do
exactly that so listen at face value
everything we go through here there's
many things that are a step in the right
direction and to be fair a big step in
the right direction but there is going
to be we are going to run into a
roadblock here because there's still a
month's long complicated process ahead
before a final vote on these changes in
2018 so the way it works is the the
unity and Reform Commission came up with
these recommendations they have to send
it to like the rules and bylaws
committee the rules and bylaws committee
sends it back to the unity and Reform
Commission then the Union Reform
Commission can either accept or reject
the changes that the
bylaws committee recommended and then
and then after that it gets sent for a
vote for the entire DNC to vote over 400
members 447 members get to vote on it at
the DNC now this is a reason to be you
know optimistic about what's gonna
happen but at the same time there's a
chance the the bylaws committee waters
it down of course there's a chance that
they said no we the two extreme too far
and by the way I don't think these go
far enough I think you can go much
further I mean again I don't know just
eliminate the super delegate rid of them
get rid of them but no oh just a
reduction whatever I mean I think
there's a chance the bylaws committee
waters it down but then they send it
back to the Unity Reform Commission the
Unity Reform Commission can reject the
recommendations from the bylaws
committee but then the real hurdle is
the DNC itself because what are you
gonna do you're gonna send it to the
same DNC that voted not that long ago to
keep taking corporate money any group of
people that you take a vote on such a
crucial issue and they they go the wrong
way why should the [ __ ] should we trust
their judgment why should we trust their
judgment and then what will happen is if
you get the rejection of these changes
well we're right back to [ __ ] square
one about a tired old party that's still
hanging on to corporatism still hanging
on to neoliberalism and clintonism and
is not willing to learn from its
mistakes and is doomed to fail again so
we have to wait and see how it plays out
we also have to be objective and fair
about what's happened to this point
what's happened to this point if you
want to grade it c-plus maybe be I mean
that's my assessment of it looking at
what they've done so far but the
question is will that go all the way and
will these reforms be implemented if
these reforms as they are here are
implemented okay okay you know I'll say
step in the right direction not good
enough but step in the right direction
and overall you pass but if it's watered
down and then it goes through or it
doesn't well then you know [ __ ] you even
more Democratic Party uh you know it's
amazing how many people that are in
power still don't get it with the
Democrats there's this mindset and I see
[ __ ] like this all the time on Twitter
too by the way this mindset of like they
try to shame voters like with the Doug
Jones and Roy Moore thing like there's
an attempt to shame voters like Oh
what we're not good enough for you you
do realize the onus is on you to get the
votes it's not that the people are
failing a democratic politician if a
democratic politician doesn't win is
that the Democratic politician failed
two people and didn't sell a vision to
get the votes to win so this effectively
this flipping of the democratic process
and the way it's supposed to work this
idea that you fall in line or else well
no how about the politician falls in
line and does the bidding of the people
and then there's this wacky idea out
there that well if the politician
listens to the people well then they
can't win what kind of [ __ ] is that so
in other words if a democratic
politician is for you know a living wage
people were [ __ ] on a Democratic
Socialist who said listen I might not
even vote for Doug Jones and then they
asked him why he goes he's not for uh
he's not for a $15 minimum wage and he's
not for Medicare for all
and like Dave Weigel was [ __ ] on him
wouldn't a logical response to be to say
[ __ ] Doug Jones you should really come
out in favor of $15 minimum wage in
Medicare for all isn't that the logical
response and what are gonna do [ __ ]
stupid Lefty haven't we been through
this before
[ __ ] trying to shame people on the
Left haven't we been through it and when
what happens then you lose so how about
instead of trying to shame them and
repeat the same thing over and over you
do a fifteen dollar minimum wage and you
do Medicare for all but
they turn around and they go no we can't
do that because then we lose the
moderate voters except you don't you
don't you keep losing when you don't
come out in favor of a $15 minimum wage
and Medicare for all so how about you
try to come out in favor of it and guess
what
about 80% of voters want to raise the
minimum wage 60% of voters want a
medicare-for-all system including more
Republican support Medicare for all then
don't when you look at the last election
Bernie won among self-described
conservatives you would say no wait a
second Hillary's more conservative so
she probably won can serve more moderate
voters conservative voters no look at
the results in every primary across the
board Bernie Sanders won among
conservative voters he did a town hall
with Chris Hayes in West Virginia in a
room full of Trump voters they gave him
a standing ovation for Medicare for all
free college and living wage so stop
with the [ __ ] bogus assumptions just
stop because you're wrong you're just
wrong instead of shaming a random
democratic socialist in Alabama how
about you say oh wow there's a lesson to
be learned here
hey maybe Doug you come out in favor of
these overwhelmingly popular policies
and then you win for sure guys it is
still a race in Alabama right now it's a
[ __ ] coin toss as to who's gonna win
this election
when one of the guys is a paedophile one
of the guys there's countless stories of
him preying on underage girls by the way
putting that aside
he's also was removed as a judge twice
for refusing to obey the Constitution
because he kept the Ten Commandments up
in his courtroom so here you a radical
theocratic maniac who's promising to get
into the Senate and vote for Donald
Trump's giant tax cut for the rich bill
that raises taxes on the middle class in
a world that made sense this guy would
be polling at 3% but he might win he
might win do you not see how it's not
just that you have the
public and based voters in Alabama are
too far gone that's not the only
conclusion here it's also wow you must
be failing miserably as the Democrat Joe
Doug Jones can clip enstein brilliant
journalist he's in Alabama right now he
tweeted last night he's at a bar
speaking of voters he asked one I think
it was a young African American lady Oh
are you gonna are you interested in
voting in this election what do you
think of Doug Jones she's like I don't
know I mean I guess I like the guy but I
don't know anything about him other than
he's not Roy Moore that's the Democratic
Party in a nutshell right now we're not
Trump we're not Trump we're not Roy
Moore we're not really more wonderful
but what are you for what are you for
have you tried that I mean that you
tried the strategy the entire [ __ ]
2016 election we're not Trump we're not
Trump and by the way have I mentioned
Russia
we're not Trump Russia we're not Trump
we're not Trump but what the [ __ ] are
you for when all you talk about is what
you're against that's at people's
reaction okay I got a year against that
and then like you do half the argument
you do the other half the argument we're
not that guy go on that's it we're not
that guy okay so I got a little bit
off-topic there but nonetheless here we
are decent changes for the Democratic
Party unity and Reform Commission but
let's actually get them [ __ ]
implemented and if you don't get them
implemented then don't [ __ ] [ __ ] and
moan and whine when you can't get the
Democratic base to vote for you
politics 101 is you don't abandon your
base you don't abandon your base you
don't abandon your base Republicans
never do that Democrats the entire party
is based on that it's the entire party
is based on that oh say things sometimes
in primaries that they might like and
then here we are in the general anyway
I'm totally a centrist and I'm totally
in favor of tax cuts for corporations
and listen I'm so moderate hey I don't
even know how I feel about the gays I
mean
you know what I mean let's should we
need gradual incremental reform Jesus so
let's get these changes implemented and
if you don't don't [ __ ] complain for
a second I don't want to hear a peep
about how you're crying cuz the left for
us cuz you got to earn the vote you have
to earn it
what's up [ __ ] so I just tried to do
a live stream before just like a random
shooting the [ __ ] kind of live stream
but come to find out live streaming is
not as easy as you might think it is so
I'm thinking we all go to the back end
of the YouTube channel you click two or
three buttons and boom you're live it
turns out that's wrong wrong wrong so I
tried that and then it hits me with
you've got to get this thing called OBS
and so then I got OBS and then I go to
do the test run and it's like not
showing me and it's a massive lag and
then it also says who are you want to do
with other encoding options and I'm like
what the [ __ ] does encoding even mean
and then it says something about Google
Hangouts I'm like why are you talking
about Google Hangouts now I'm trying to
do a YouTube livestream and I just got
this thing OBS that I thought would let
me do a YouTube livestream it's just
nothing's [ __ ] easy
it's like it's like a life it's so easy
when you're sitting there and looking at
somebody else's life you're like oh I
know how to fix that person's situation
dude listen all you got to do is and
then you give them the advice but then
when it's your own you're like what the
[ __ ] do I do here you would think like
something as simple as live streaming on
YouTube say will you just click a
[ __ ] button and you go it's like no
you there's [ __ ] keys and codes and
you got a [ __ ] approve it through
three bureaucratic boards
so anyway I decided to I decided to do
it the old-fashioned way which is just
tweet that I want to talk to you and
have you ask me questions so that's what
I did and now we're gonna go through
some of the questions here how's that
sound
do you even lift bro from regular dude
uh yes I do
I used to lift a lot bro
but now I've been I've been slacking for
years I've been slacking I feel like
most people go through this is made up
but I feel like most people go through a
gym phase you know in their 20s at some
point or their late teens and then
they're they stick with that for a while
and then after a while they're like what
am i doing I'm just lifting heavy [ __ ]
so I've been out of the gym game on the
regular basis for a while every now and
then I get a burst of oh I'll do it for
whatever 2 months or whatever then you
fall off but to answer your question I
do even lift bro and also I got it we
got to try to get a thing going I mean I
don't know how many of you guys would
want to join me but we were talking
about this on Kyle and Koren we got to
give give each other the the feedback
and the and the mental boost and the
positive reinforcement to start on
January 1st with some of this stuff cuz
I'm down for that
I like to draw a clean line okay now
we're in 2018 and then 28 from here on
we're not [ __ ] around guys we're
gonna everybody's gonna we're gonna have
a good diet we're gonna work out you
know however many days a week whatever
you can have in your schedule but that's
what I'm gonna do January 1st It's A
Wrap son I say that but then by January
14th I'll be like anyway let's pretend
like January 1st didn't even happen
we're done mm-hm Leon asks Leon is
Nintendo he does all the kyln corn
everybody go file but follow him on
Twitter and by the way just so everybody
knows if you do follow him you get the
Kyle and corns like a little bit earlier
just so you know that's because that's
you know they are released on secular
talk but they are pre released if you
will from Leon so he asks who are the
top 20 right-wing [ __ ] on Twitter in
your opinion good googly moogly I don't
know Leon that's a tough question now
you're asking specifically about Twitter
here which actually makes the question
harder because then some are kind of
eliminated right some right-wing
[ __ ]
eliminated because it's not like
michaelsavage the right-wing radio host
is on twitter at least I don't think he
is so I don't know but I do know that
Ben Shapiro is a dick you know I read a
great takedown in fact you know what
while we're here while we're on my
Twitter feed let's go let's go find it I
tweeted it earlier today let's see sorry
phone's going off here you go so this
guy Nathan J Robinson he wrote a great
article one on ben shapiro another one
lessons from Chomsky the one on Chomsky
it's brilliant and it puts into words
thoughts about Chomsky that I've had but
I haven't really been able to express so
you know Chomsky was a big influence on
me I read a lot of his stuff and Nathan
J Robinson really kind of explains to me
almost why I like Chomsky and so I
recommend this article lessons from
Chomsky and current affairs so check
that out if you have the time it's a
long read but I thought it was worth it
sorry for the lag e speed here this is a
shitty um this was a shitty laptop
lessons from Chomsky very very good
piece but he also wrote the cool kids
philosopher and this is about Ben
Shapiro now as I said in the tweet here
I disagree with and I'm confused by
certain parts here and there in this
article but overall it is a [ __ ]
vicious and pretty good and accurate
takedown of Ben Shapiro now I'm gonna
warn you guys up front you have to get
over the almost
the self-righteous smug indignant tone
of the guy who wrote it but because he
wrote it it's almost like he's writing
to people who are already inclined to
agree
so if you're already inclined to agree
then you're gonna digest this article
easily but if you're not then it's gonna
it'll feel you know it feels a little
gross at times because of how he phrases
it like here let's just read the first
part here it's easy to laugh as some of
us do at the phrase conservative
intellectual like right there people
some people are already gonna be like
well [ __ ] this guy but I mean I tend to
agree with them on that point when the
most prominent public spokesman for
their rights ideas include Miley
innopolis charles Murray and Dinesh
D'Souza one might conclude that the
movement does not have anything serious
to offer beyond feminism as cancer black
people are dumb and Democrats are Nazis
those are as I understand at the central
intellectual contributions of Milo
innopolis Marion to suit and D'Souza
respectively so like you get the sense
that he's a little bit flippant in in
like how he's introducing it here but
this is a long read but when you get
into the meat of it it's actually
anything but that he's anything but like
super flippant he really really died sex
Ben Shapiro and you know what he is
because basically the gist of it is
listen he talks really fast and he
himself is kind of smarmy and smug and
condescending and he uses a lot of like
logical fallacies as he gets into in
this piece
but there when you really dig deep
there's nothing there's no there there
like he has some really unbelievably
shitty and odious ideas that it's
amazing that he's even having this
moment where he's like really popular so
anyway check that out if you get the
time but I want to show you the other
Ben Shapiro tweet that I had the other
day because again this is one of those
moments where I think unmasks
Shapiro for what his ideology is it's an
old tweet it's from 2010
but it it really just [ __ ] shows what
this guy's all about and how he might
try to put some layers over it today and
might try to add a little more nuance to
his take today but look at this look at
this Israelis like to build Arabs like
to bomb crap and live in open sewage
this is not a difficult issue hashtag
settlements Rock are you [ __ ] kidding
me that's one of the dumbest tweets I've
ever read in my life
can you imagine typing that and thinking
you make sense and then somehow get
getting a movement that thinks you're
some sort of genius so I'm sort of a
brilliant thinker
hashtag settlement rock so in other
words yeah when we you know when
Israelis occupy the Palestinians
illegally under international law when
they do brazen land grabs it doesn't
count it doesn't count when we violate
international law doesn't count it's
totally cool because you know we're
inherently superior they're inherently
inferior and you know the Arabs they
like to bomb crap and live in open
sewage this is like the definition of
bigotry I couldn't if you you couldn't
have a computer give you a better tweet
that's just like here this is what
bigotry looks like so and then also just
players Arabs like to bomb crap right so
that's what he says there what do we
have here oops u.s. bombed Iraq Syria
Pakistan Afghanistan Libya Yemen Somalia
in 2016
why did the u.s. drop 26,000 171 bombs
on the world last year it doesn't count
doesn't count it doesn't count when
Israelis violate international law it
doesn't count when the u.s. violates
international law it doesn't count when
we kill civilians doesn't
but you know those [ __ ] Arabs those
Arabs and you know how they are a
[ __ ] violent bomb and [ __ ] and living
living in open sewage and in that
current affairs article there's such a
great point they're like it's funny how
this this guy who thinks he's such an
intellectual if he were to see somewhere
like a story about how there are
Palestinians living in open sewage it's
like he pawns that off to the inherent
nature of somebody who's Arab as opposed
to I don't know maybe the fact that
they're under occupation and there
aren't that many supplies that are
allowed into Gaza and you know they've
kind of been starved from the outside by
the Israelis and like hey maybe it's not
like they're choosing to live in open
sewage for the ones who are you [ __ ]
jackass but anyway I'm sorry Leon I'm
not gonna get into the top 20 um I had a
little voice crack there it's like I'm
still a boy in puberty I'm not gonna get
into the top twenty shitty conservatives
but I will tell you Ben Shapiro nowadays
is kind of high on my list steven
crowder has always been high on my list
too because steven crowder he thinks
Hitler's a liberal
[Music]
oh it's not Stephen like that uh Stephen
like this steven crowder Hitler is
liberal let's see unbelievable look from
his own website in case you think that's
his own video in case you think we're
straw Manning here this isn't all his
own website louder with Crowder myth
busted actually yes Hitler was a
socialist liberal I'm steven crowder and
I defy anything I don't like as being
liberal yeah anything that's bad that's
ever happened is the fault of the
Liberals yeah I'm so young and edgy and
cool I'm adult enough to be able to
acknowledge the [ __ ] people who are
on the Left who are monsters look at
Steven Crowder look at what he does he's
he's fundamentally incapable of
admitting that any you know historical
barbarian any obviously negative
character in history is a right-winger
because he's has to protect I have to
protect my sweet sweet right-wingers
it's part of my narrative is part of my
narrative I can't ever admit fault on my
side which is why you're a [ __ ]
jackass and it's amazing and by the way
dude chill with the I mean okay now I'm
being a dick but it he's I'm telling you
he's got issues look at this look at
this steven crowder in dress I'm not
just saying this to be a douche although
I am being a douche but steven crowder
finds an excuse every two and a half
weeks to dress up as a woman and look
man I mean I kind of feel bad for the
guy in one sense because he obviously
has some sort of deep-seated issue where
like he he's like trans on some level
like he wants to be a woman on some
level but he doesn't he's so invested in
acting like transgenderism doesn't exist
her it's some sort of mental disorder or
something
that he he would never allow himself to
be happy and then become trans but I
swear I've seen how and even his own
fans have noticed this and been like she
had Manuel I you keep doing this you
keep you keep finding excuses to dress
up like a woman
so look I'm not dude I believe in
freedom you can do whatever the [ __ ] you
want to do but I just find it weird
because it strikes me like he's kind of
being like those Republican politicians
who are super anti-gay and they run on
family values and you know they act like
they act like being gay is evil and
wrong and terrible and immoral and then
they get caught blowing some dude in a
New Jersey Turnpike bathroom well that's
what happens I mean Crowder strikes me
as he bashes transgenderism all the time
but somehow there's a thousand pictures
of him dressed as a woman online so I'll
leave it at that I'll let you guys draw
your own conclusions but yeah I don't
know there's something going on there I
I think there's something going on there
but anyway so a ben shapiro steven
crowder some of the worst right-wingers
on twitter joe walsh is pretty bad he's
a former congressman and he says stupid
[ __ ] all the time but i don't know i
don't know about all the worst ones on
twitter there's a bunch of shitty ones
oh here we go look at this Drizzy drew
by the way he does the secular talk
animated series so if you go follow him
you will get those sooner just so you
know if you go follow him you'll get
those sooner so that's so these are
little tricks of the secular talk trade
if you want to like get the secular talk
animated early you want to give Kyle out
of context early you follow
Drizzy drew you could copy it from right
here and you follow Leon Nintendo okay
let's see what else we got oh I didn't
even answer his question the ass man
test marry Boff kill me I think it's
will say [ __ ] marry kill right what
why'd he put Boff is that a
typo or do I not know the cool new lingo
Jennifer Lopez Kim Kardashian Beyonce
okay sorry Jennifer Lopez I'm gonna have
to kill you mm-hmm and the reason the
reason I say that j.lo and her prime is
like a 1 for me okay but she's older now
she still looks amazing
but she lost that defining [ __ ] like
flawless booty in my opinion I mean
she's still absolutely gorgeous
drop-dead gorgeous but she had that like
no-holds-barred like famous ass world
famous ass it was so nice but now it's
like smaller and she's older and she's
more fit now than she is thick you know
what I mean
so Jennifer Lopez gonna have to get rid
of you sorry I'll marry Beyonce just
because she seems like her I don't know
if she seems like a really good person
she doesn't seem like an obviously
shitty person
um I feel like me and her would get
along on a lot on a lot of stuff like
politics wise probably but maybe not I
don't know Kim Kardashian Kim Kardashian
[ __ ] Beyonce kill well go with that no
no wait what did I say
a Beyonce marry I'm sorry Jennifer Lopez
kill Beyonce marry because I think we'd
get along the best and Kim Kardashian
[ __ ] okay what are your thoughts on the
Laurier University TA story okay so
that's for those you who don't know
that's um a a woman who actually hold on
one second I want to respond to this
text real quick
okay um where was I
what are your thoughts on this Laurie a
TA scandal sorry I'm pouring a drink in
the background here well your thoughts
on the Laurier University ta story so
what happened with that is there was a
basically like an assistant teacher who
played a clip of a debate on gender
pronouns in a class that was on grammar
and I guess the like the brass at the
school figured out about it or heard
about it because one student complained
or something like so I guess the
principal or whoever called
his teacher's assistant into their
office and then they kind of like told
her like this is not acceptable you
can't play that clip and she's like why
can I not play it because it was a
debate between Jordan Peterson and
somebody else about the use of gender
pronouns like you know and they
basically said to her listen this is
like you're debating something that's
not debatable this is like debating
climate change it exists to try to teach
the other side of it is not it's not
legitimate it's like trying to teach
both sides of evolution well there's
really not two sides of evolution so no
you can't do that so I don't agree on
this one with the principal because I
think that the issue that they were
debating actually was debatable because
it's not so Jordan Peterson I disagree
when he says oh I'm no I'm not gonna
call trans people by what they want to
be called so that's just you being a
dick that's not like a free speech issue
I mean you have the right if you want to
to call somebody who's a transgender
woman a man or something like you could
do that but you're just a dick you're
not it's not like you're some sort of
brave hero or something like oh I'm
gonna be a dick to this person who's
already experienced a lot in their life
and or going through a lot it's like wow
okay
but there are other issues in the in the
in the pronoun realm that I think are
open
for debate like like Z with X I and
stuff like using that as some sort of
like oh you need to call this person by
that because they don't want to be
affiliated with like either gender so
you call them Z well no that's not like
it appears to me like Society has not
said okay we're all down with that so
it's almost like it's kind of made up
very recently so I think of course it's
still debatable
so if that's what they were what she was
showing in class and by the way the the
teacher's assistant said I don't even
agree with Jordan Peterson I just
thought that this was good to get the
class interested so that we can then go
on to talk about gendered pronouns and I
don't think she's wrong about that I
actually agree with the principles the
principle on the broader question the
broader question being you know hey are
some things not debatable well the
answer is of course you're not going to
teach both sides of math like Oh teach 2
plus 2 equals 4 and 2 plus 2 equals 22
that's [ __ ] that's false equivalence
that's relativism it's just nonsense the
same thing with climate change same
thing on a bunch of issues that I think
the right would insist are debatable
even though they're not debatable but on
this one I actually think there's a
discussion to be had and then it gets
the whole Jordan Peterson thing gets
even more complicated because Jordan
Peterson like okay so I think he's
overrated and he has some really goofy
ideas he thinks porn is terrible and bad
for people and he's he's religious and
you know all this stuff and he's a dick
when he says I'm not gonna call trans
people by their you know their preferred
pronoun but then also he was fighting
against like this arbitrary human rights
code or something in Canada that said
like I don't I don't want to [ __ ] up the
story so I hope I'm being totally
accurate without presenting this but it
was like in the Human Rights Code that
so guess what everybody the US just
recognized Jerusalem as the capital of
Israel Trump is also gonna move the US
Embassy there which is really game set
match on this issue so what does that
mean well if the two-state solution was
almost dead before now it's just 100%
dead you know but it's beyond a pipe
dream at this point and for the longest
time when other progressives had already
kind of abandoned the idea of the
two-state solution and they said no
there needs to be one state with equal
rights because that's the only thing at
this point that's possible I held on to
the idea of the two-state solution for a
longer time than many progressives but
now even I'm off it because it's not it
is just so obviously and clearly a lie
to continue to perpetuate the status quo
and have permanent occupation and
apartheid so it's dead it's dead it's a
hundred percent dead this is the nail in
the coffin now under a two-state deal
what would have happened is Jerusalem
would be split with East Jerusalem being
the capital of an independent
Palestinian state but now you have Trump
saying Jerusalem is the capital of
Israel and then people go as far as to
say the undivided capital of Israel why
would they say undivided in other words
what they're saying is it's ours it's
all ours
these Palestinians can go [ __ ]
themselves
and by the way hashtag the resistance
Chuck Schumer totally agrees with Donald
Trump on this the top Democratic leaders
are like right on I'd see that again I
don't want I don't want to be labor this
point but I feel like I'm doing it
because I'm responding to the people who
are belaboring this point but the reason
why corporate Democrats don't shut the
[ __ ] up about Russia Russia Russia
is because it's an issue that's easy
that allows them to not talk about any
positive vision that they have so -
Russia Russia Russia Russia Russia oh my
god the president is basically a
Manchurian Candidate
he's a Putin puppet he's a foreign agent
you know he's beholden to a hostile
actor foreign actor they talk about that
because they want to distract from the
fact that they kind of agree with him
and the Republicans on many issues it
was there were a few Democrats who
crossed over to deregulate Wall Street
just recently we covered that story it
well if you agree on deregulating wall
street then where why are you where are
you drawing the differences between you
and the Republicans oh I know Russia
uh Trump's beholden to Russia or
something anyway I'm gonna now vote with
him on deregulating Wall Street ah Trump
Russia Trump Russia Trump Russia
oh he just declared Jerusalem the
capital of Israel I totally agree with
him on that one Oh
Russia Russia Russia oh my god isn't the
Russia thing crazy Oh Trump she's bombed
Assad and the Syrian government even
though they're fighting Isis I agree
with him on that one so you do see the
trick that's being played damn of
corporate Democrats they're not talking
about medicare-for-all they're not
talking about free college they're not
talking about a living wage they're not
talking about ending the wars they're
not talking about ending the drug war
they're not giving you a positive vision
as to what they want to do for the
country they're saying Russia Russia
Russia and then secretly agreeing with
Trump on incredibly toxic and odious
parts of his agenda but I no no I'm I'm
the crazy one and I'm the one that's all
you know I'm the one that somehow
wrapped up in hysteria that seems to me
like the opposite is true and by the way
I support what Muller's doing and that
he's using this issue as a gateway to
take down Trump administration officials
for corruption and financial crimes I'm
100% on board with that but what I'm
talking about is democratic messaging
there's a reason why they're only
talking about Russia because it's easy
and it's safe and it means they don't
have to talk about all the other issues
to improve your life because they don't
really believe in fighting on those
issues they kind of agree with the
Republicans a sad percentage of the time
so hashtag the resistance is totally
with them on this so this is a slap in
the face to all Palestinians and it
exposes the peace process for the farce
that it is and listen it's illegal under
international law is what it is what
they're doing is totally illegal the UN
says no that's not the case they go we
don't care only the US can call like a
press conference and just casually
announce that yeah international law we
don't we disagree the [ __ ] that's not
that's not a thing you could just be a
yeah no that's not that's our on the
table the whole idea of the law just is
supposed to be blind equal protection
under the law it's supposed to apply to
everybody equally but the US Trump
called a press conference to say yeah
international law some international law
we disagree and then of course what's
gonna happen now there is definitely
gonna be a violent backlash because now
it's proving that diplomacy hasn't
worked that is proven that is proven
that this is the the trick that's been
played on the Palestinians all these
years hey come on why don't you just
negotiate directly with Israel and then
you'll be able to get your you know the
answer you want and the outcome you want
that's good for everybody so then they
go to go and do that and Netanyahu and
the Israeli government go no we disagree
with every single one of the things that
you want there is no middle ground here
and we're not going to do any of the
things that you propose and then
Palestinians go okay well I guess I'll
go to the international community then
when they go to the international
community
Israel turns around goes oh how dare you
go behind our backs international
community why don't you do direct
negotiations with us do we just talk
with you and you said no then they go to
the international community the US and
Israel block any attempt to really fix
this problem and then every now and then
there will be a bubble up of violence
that comes to the surface there will be
a disproportionate reaction from the
Israeli
that Massacre civilians and children
like what happened in Gaza in 2014 I
think it was 80% or more civilians who
were killed
Israel bond hospitals they bomb the only
power plant in Gaza they bombed schools
so when there's violence you know it's
met with disproportionate violence and
of course people go hey that's immoral
don't use violence then when they try to
go to direct negotiations as Rios know
we're not gonna agree to anything you
say then they go to the international
community Israel in the u.s. block it
and round and round around we go and
then now they're saying oh now we're
just gonna declare that a key portion of
what would be part of the peace
negotiations where there would obviously
have to be a deal over Jerusalem where
you'd split it up
no we're declaring that that's our quote
undivided capital and then again when
there's now when there's a violent
backlash they're gonna go off oh my
goodness who could have seen this coming
[ __ ] everybody with the brain cuz it
turns out when you walk into somebody's
house and you say this is mine now get
the [ __ ] out
turns out they get mad they get mad and
they say I'm gonna let you steal
everything I know that's mine and then
what I'm just gonna walk away into the
sunset no they're gonna there's gonna be
a violent backlash because they're gonna
say you're taking our what is ours so
it's unbelievable that we just announced
it so casually like yeah I know we and
Trump had the nerve and this is the most
disgusting part of it all in my opinion
and you know Israel is gonna do the same
line here they go oh we're announcing
that Jerusalem Jerusalem is the
undivided capital of Israel but
understand that this is not in any way
an attempt to undermine the peace
process this is an attempt to get a fair
deal for both Israel and Palestine are
you kidding me there's something that's
even more insidious about somebody who
is your enemy but pretends to be your
friend that's even
more insidious than somebody who's just
like I'm against you and I'm gonna let
you know upfront and that's what the US
is doing here and that's what Israel's
doing here as they spit in the eye of
all Palestinians they Jack their
territory this is illegal under
international law this legitimizes about
two hundred thousand illegal settlements
in occupied East Jerusalem so they steal
your [ __ ] and then they go what what no
no this isn't in any way me trying to
you know do something that's not fair on
your behalf I want a fair deal for
everybody
it's so [ __ ] weaselly and slimy and
the rest of the world goes that's some
[ __ ]
every other country is like what are can
you stop with this nonsense but now
we're in a position where what do you do
what do you do in this situation I mean
honestly the only hope is the EU
basically saying okay we're not going to
stand for this anymore and now we're
gonna do an official boycott we're not
interested in products coming out of
Israel definitely products coming out of
you know the occupied territories we're
gonna do an official boycott basically
all of the EU hopping on board with BDS
would be I don't know the only way to
put a sufficient amount of international
pressure where eventually you get some
sort of solution and at this point I
don't know what the solution would be i
outside of a one-state solution for the
longest time i supported a two-state
solution because palestinians seem to
indicate if the options are you know
nothing or having an independent
Palestine along the 67 borders they'll
take the independent Palestine along the
67 borders but at this point if they're
just saying that's not that's not
happening ever so you need a one state
deal with equal rights for Palestinians
to stop permanent apartheid but then in
that situation you're still dealing with
you know a hundred years or more of
insane you know oppression and unequal
treatment
and so it's not it's not gonna be easy
it's almost like a desegregating the
South kind of thing so what do you do I
don't know that you use would have to
apply pressure and even then the the
terms of such a deal are difficult to
wrap your mind around and fathom because
we all knew the terms of what a deal
would be if it was a two-state deal
roughly along the 1967 borders you know
split up Jerusalem but now it's like
we're right back to square one and they
got to figure something out and it I
mean it's all on the EU to do it because
the u.s. is just gonna 100% back Israel
no matter what it did under Obama now
it's doing it under at least under Obama
there was the symbolic like these
illegal settlements are not okay it was
a non-binding resolution it was just
totally symbolic but now you know the
trouble administration's like yeah we
don't care we don't care whatever Israel
wants whatever Netanyahu and the
far-right wants so EU step up sign on to
BDS that's all I could think of really
that could even begin to unravel and try
to fix this situation and even then it's
a pain in the ass and who knows how
it'll get resolved but just so you know
who is Trump serving here with this
decision well to answer that question
let me show you a clip of one of the
people who's most excited by this greens
to all of our partners and John Hagee
ministries and Christians United for
Israel across America today is an
historic day today President Donald
Trump has recognized the city of
Jerusalem as the capital of the state of
Israel this has never been done before
by a u.s. president president Trump told
me when last we spoke
regarding the embassy that he would not
disappoint us speaking of the
evangelical community and today he has
kept that promise president Truong
has made a bold and courageous stand
that will be remembered in history
forever like President Harry Truman who
made a bold and courageous decision to
recognize Israel at statehood president
Trump has stepped into political
immortality what he has done today will
be eternally celebrated this shows the
world that Jerusalem as the capital of
Israel is not up for negotiation and
America is and shall always remain a
loyal ally of Israel I encourage every
person to express your support to the
president for keeping his promise and
for standing with Israel America's only
friend in the Middle East god bless each
and every one of you
he said Donald Trump stepped into
political immortality by doing this
that's John Hagee he's a fundamentalist
evangelical in the United States he
wrote a book where he said 2014 is the
beginning of the apocalypse because of
the blood moons he wrote a book thing
end times is gonna start in 2014 this
guy he literally believes Jesus will
come back and you know Massacre Jews in
Israel and usher in end times by the way
under Biblical prophecy that land has to
all be Israel so that that's why he
supports this that's why he supports
yeah whatever ethnically cleanse
Palestinians kick them off their own
land we don't care about them because
according to the Bible that land is all
Israel's and then that allows Jesus to
come back and usher in end times so
these are the people
the evangelical fundamentalist far-right
Bible literalists who have been pushing
Trump all along hey this is what you
have to do about Israel don't worry
about the Palestinian you got to be a
good friend of Israel how do you be good
friend of Israel well you gotta say hey
Jerusalem is the undivided capital of
Israel don't look the other way when
Netanyahu goes on his [ __ ] purging
campaigns and bombs women and children
so this is religious lunatics saying we
need to fulfill Bible prophecy so give
it give it all to Israel by the way the
far right in Israel is ecstatic over
this ultra-orthodox fundamentalist Jews
are ecstatic over this there's a group
in Israel that called for Obama to be
assassinated in the street in 2015 that
did a press statement the other day and
they were like we love what Donald Trump
is doing here this is a great thing that
Donald Trump is doing so this is Donald
Trump caving to extreme ultra
fundamentalists with Christians and Jews
and trying to fulfill Biblical prophecy
and letting them do whatever they want
because that's his base that's his base
right there so this is this is who's
happy about this and again now you're
gonna take a region that's already a
volatile region that's already on fire I
mean look at what's happening in Syria
and you're gonna virtually guarantee
more fighting new fighting bubbling up
of tensions 100% because it turns out
when you steal somebody's [ __ ] they get
kind of mad so couldn't have done
anything worse than this this is as bad
as it gets on that issue and I mean I
guess the only thing that some people
would consider an upside is that okay
well at least now we're done pretending
the two-state solution as a thing and
that this was my
awakening on that to my argument had
always been hey listen if a two-state
solution is a pipe dream I can only
think of one thing that's a bigger pipe
dream which is a one state solution but
now what they're saying is it's not even
it's not ambiguous that you even under a
very administration that's tough on
Israel in the US which haha laughs along
with me
you're never gonna roll back all these
advancements I mean all the land that
Israel's on post 1967 is illegal under
international law but now you're talking
about you know recognition of the two
hundred thousand or more settlers who
are uh you know who are illegally
occupying in East Jerusalem so it's just
it's so far gone now that well some
people would say hey at least we're done
with that you know delusion and we could
all agree it's a one state solution with
equal rights in this matter of fighting
and for and implementing that but make
no mistake about it this is a giant
mistake it's to appease the far-right
fundamentalists and it's illegal and it
will lead to violence
Halla everybody means you got another
episode of Kyle encore in here first of
all everybody go give corn some love on
Twitter because he just came back from a
holiday party to make sure that you
lovely people got a full dose of Kyle
and corn if people are trying to hate on
me this morning because I put out a
tweet about you know your fans are mean
on me man
I mean sometimes they're cool sometimes
they're not but I put a tweet about
because when I used to grow up when I
used to grow I used to grow and I grew
up I played on fields that had mad geese
[ __ ] on it yeah like I did too
sure yeah yeah everybody like you play
soccer football and there's [ __ ]
everywhere
yep there wasn't someone going around
cleaning up all that geese [ __ ] so I
must have just like eventually sank in
there yeah it's like it's just part of
the grass after a while exactly so my
dogs go out in my backyard I have like
this um cuz they're not trained well
enough where they could just go roam in
my backyard or not I'm gonna lecture
fence all that [ __ ] so I just let them
out of my backyard on this um I hope I'm
up to this attachment and skulls I don't
know 50 feet 75 feet yeah and they just
roam around my backyard and they just
take a [ __ ] whenever they want usually
I've been going out there and picking up
all their crap and I take a plastic bag
and it fills up with all their pool I
usually go like a week later it's all
there poop mm-hmm but lately I just been
lazy and I just been like [ __ ] it you
can leave it I'm just gonna leave it
because I feel like it's your backyard
right it's my backyard but I feel like
I've heard that manure or manure
whatever it's pronounced yeah is um is
good for the grass and it's like a
natural fertilizer
I mean if it's your own property you eat
it over the [ __ ] you want to do you
could have a bear [ __ ] back there if you
want but that's my pocket liquor [ __ ]
bag yeah you can if you want that's why
people were giving you [ __ ] because you
said that or no no because my grandma
was all [ __ ] oh you know because I
read that tweet I was like I don't get
what he's saying like III saw the first
line I was like I get what you're saying
about the geese [ __ ] but then like as I
kept reading it I like lost the the
thought like I didn't see the line of it
I
to do that when I was back in the day
when I was like I used to right say um
because I would want to get into college
basketball uh-huh and out like right to
college basketball coaches or college
basketball programs and I would I would
try and write the [ __ ] myself
but then my sister was like I think she
was an English major so she's really
good at writing and knows punctuation
where's the put commas and all that [ __ ]
I don't know where to put any of that
stuff so I would be like I have really
good content but I never know how to
like you know make it see yeah sure
exactly so like I guess the content of
my tweet was good but the punctuation
Allah [ __ ] wasn't good but so should I
go to the tweet now I'm gonna go to the
tweet and see what you see yeah well and
also the iPhone [ __ ] me up because the
iPhone because of the eye thing have you
had that um error or no if you come
across that I think my phone
automatically updated one night so it
went away but I did have that problem
for like a little bit was just in the
plane okay so here we go your tweet was
if no one oh I know why they were
ripping on you if no one every picked up
you wanted to say if no one ever picked
up the geese droppings from the soccer
fields I used to play on do I really
have to pick up the dog poo from my
backyard I'm going to skip today yeah I
don't mean they were probably ripping on
you because of the grammar but someone I
respect the girl that's just someone
tweeted at me some chick and just wrote
hashtag Granberg but I don't understand
what you just said that's from Jacob and
then hey what does your wife have to say
about this that's pretty funny
geese droppings did you play soccer a
Maybury high school how to get that one
I don't know what's made very high
school and then hashtag grammar was from
Milla Han shot at the Milla Han that's
pretty funny yeah no I get what you're
saying man I get what you're saying so
how was this uh how was this party that
you were at you were just telling me it
was at top
off which I'm jealous if it was a top
golf because I want to play top golf and
I [ __ ] everybody up at top golf because
you got it I wish you were there
it's got like Oh for those you who don't
know it's like it's like a points game
with golf like at a driving range where
if you hit it in a certain space you get
certain amount of points yeah [ __ ]
lights up and it's like cool looking out
in the driving rain it's like a regular
driving range yeah but the like certain
areas you can hit it to light up and you
get points depending on how far you
drive it and yeah accurate you drive it
it's really cool it is cool there's none
around me or else I would go to that
[ __ ] yeah I think there's one I think
they open one up in New Jersey okay it
might be the closest to New York but
they have drinks there they have food
there do you have any of the food or no
I had the drinks extra would drink
Corona Corona you went beer yeah one
beer um had a couple vodka sprites okay
couple shots there was like hot cuz damn
keeps growing it was a couple shots
tequila shots and then there was also um
like these hot chocolate shots and
because we were outside it was cold
oh it has to be free yeah so like I
guess they had this someone always
discovers this one drink that like
everybody likes or whatever and it was
like this hot chocolate type shot you
know remember those old chocolates I
don't know if they're old but it came
like a green wrapper and it was a like a
chocolate and I had like a little green
line through it it was called like Andes
or Ames or something like that that's
what they said like it tastes like those
things exactly like it it was probably
delicious right it was it was pretty
good yeah isn't that weird how you ever
had those drinks where someone's like
they go to the bar and the Hellmuth is
duck and pepper shot or let me get the
Willie root beer doctor am shot and it
tastes identical to like what a drink
would like what so
tastes like there's something yes I've
had delicious drinks like that but
here's my problem I never [ __ ]
remember what they're called in fact I'm
gonna text my friend I I had at like
their wedding destroyed they were having
this drink and they were like oh you
should try this I bet you'd like it and
they said it to me and I was like I'm
not gonna like that [ __ ] and then I
tried it and I was like this is the most
delicious drink I've ever had in my life
was it on the more candy side or like
more soda side
I feel like vanilla II or something okay
it was like a mix of like an
after-dinner drink and her Anna and
something else it was I'm just gonna ask
how else to get the answer and then I'll
tell everybody and then I am
recommending this [ __ ] to everybody
who's listening right now because you
will [ __ ] love it yeah that sounds
like fun man you got did you have
anything to eat when you were there no
they had some appetizers chicken
dumplings that sounds good what else do
they have meatballs and then they had
some chicken mashed potatoes like hors
d'oeuvres type of stuff I'm not the
biggest wall fan are you a big meatball
fan or no no I don't really get down
with the meatballs like mama balls are
too heavy mmm like you know what sucks
you eat like meatballs and then like
three hours later you burp and it's just
like that's the grossest [ __ ] taste
ever I'm simple like when I go to a
wedding want am NOT a fan of just like
cheese like the cheese is when they put
out like that stuff Oh like the
antipasto yeah yeah I'm a big big fan of
pot stickers Oh pot stickers are [ __ ]
from heaven staple is delicious how are
you with crab cakes mmm I mean no right
they're always better than I expect them
to because I don't really taste the crab
but I don't love them but you try it
like you're okay to try it I wouldn't
like I had it I've had it and it's it's
always it's always you know what it's
like it's like the movie snakes on a
plane it's better than I expected but
like yeah I expected it to be the
grossest thing ever and then it's just
like mediocre and I'm like okay but I
don't have that unless
like I would only eat some [ __ ] like
that if I am starving
true yeah because I saw them and they
sort of look like potato latkes a little
bit because it looked like potato
emotional delicious bangin those are
unbelievably delicious bangin first time
I had it was in like grade school
somebody brought him in and I ate them
and I was like what the [ __ ] is this
this is the most huge thing I've ever
had you're like I mean your whole show
was secular and you grew up in a
secularist
area where there was Jews Catholics but
did you know I mean like you knew Jewish
people growing up right like you went to
bar mitzvahs and stuff like that of
course you'd be so surprised because
like my wife is from an area when I
first met her we went to a diner by her
house and I was like oh we'll go to the
diner like they must have like just like
a matzo ball soup or something like that
he don't but like not even they don't
she was like like what's that like
what's matzo below one didn't even know
what matzo ball soup with was with and
then ii had to start thinking of like oh
yeah there was a couple jewish people in
my grade but like outside of New York
there's not that many Jewish people that
like people grow up with they don't know
Bar Mitzvahs so first of all when the
numbers are astonishing actually there's
not that many Jews in the world like oh
really it's written no in fact I'm gonna
look it up now because I wanna because
the numbers I remember being blown away
by it
which is crazy because they have their
own like [ __ ] state you know I think
like when you think of the big religions
everybody the probably the main ones
everybody goes Christianity Islam
Judaism and then you throw in like
Hinduism and Buddhism you know but a so
but here you go I don't know that's not
the right answer hold on I'll find it
[Music]
but it's a lot smaller than well let me
just type in size of religions but I was
gonna say our area that we grew up in it
is a much higher concentration of Jewish
people in the New York area
the
there is in most other places around
anywhere else yeah like there are there
are other places where there are a
decent number of Jewish people but there
are like some like where's like none
order welfare does people because they
moved from New York probably in
California in some places too but like
in the middle of the country you don't I
don't think there's almost any mm-hmm
you know okay so let's say Christianity
the biggest religion in the world 2.4
billion Jesus Christ literally Jesus
Christ Islam second-biggest 1.6 billion
then you have secular they say 1.1
billion Hinduism 1.15 billion Buddhism
376 million oh wow
Judaism 14 million total Wow
so that's surprising isn't it because
because that's cadet and that's just us
being biased by the perspective the
context where we grew up
because we grew up around a lot of
Jewish people a lot of Christian people
but like Catholics probably mostly but
also maybe some Protestants people who
just weren't religious and then it was a
mix of races to Hispanic black white but
that's just us being biased by our
context there are some places in the
country where you go there's no black
people you know there's there's no Jews
it was like what is this so yeah I'm not
I'm actually not crazy surprised to come
to think of it as to the response of
your wife because it's like where she's
where she is from there just weren't
like okay there were a few Jewish people
you know not that many by us
I guess the smallest minority around us
at least as far as I remember is
probably like Asian would you agree like
I feel like we had not as many and when
I say Asian I mean like Chinese
specifically like it wasn't Chinese or
Japanese people there's a decent number
of Indians so South Asian mm-hm but not
I don't recall Chinese do you growing up
no not really just like it's evil like 1
or 2 I remember yeah
but yeah that's interesting stuff man
but but the Chinese or Japanese would
still be they'd still fall in that
Christian Catholic category no I think
um
[Music]
Shinto is I think it's Shinto is the big
all they have their own in Japan let me
let me double check that that's
interesting I didn't know the hominin
religion in Japan I don't know why
Shantou public yeah ocean tow and
Buddhism are the two major religions in
Japan and then in China if they're
non-religious in fact it's like
literally and I don't even agree with
this it's like it's like it's on paper
it's a communist country they don't
really act like one
they act more like a hyper capitalist
country but I think they have like
almost state-enforced atheism so no it
almost sound like a good thing right I
don't know no because you're forcing
people like I'm an atheist but I want to
just give people the freedom to be
whatever the [ __ ] they want to be my
understanding is that in China they
actively like oppress all religious
beliefs because their view is that that
can that like threatens the power of the
state you see what I'm saying
mmm so religion in China okay let's see
what they say this is the all trusty
Wikipedia China has long I love how
Wikipedia can be super accurate but then
like right after an incident happens it
could be super inaccurate yeah like um
Austin Rivers I know in the NBA he I've
got into a confrontation with someone on
the sidelines or something like that and
was like cursing out and right after
that happened someone to is a copy your
page and change his profile picture it's
like a trash can
oh [ __ ] but it's just like people go to
this website to look for accurate
information and then at the most
important time when you go to that
website to look for the most accurate
information it's most likely when that
[ __ ] is gonna be most inaccurate
that's that actually happened with Steve
minuchin who is the Goldman Sachs guy
who Trump picked to be in his
administration I think it was Treasury
secretary who picked him for
I looked him up to learn more about him
on Wikipedia when I when he got picked
and it said it said named Steve minuchin
occupation Satan funny if you were at a
regular time to look at that I'm sure
his occupation would have been right it
would have been like secretary whatever
the [ __ ] he does but like the time when
you were searching him was probably when
he was like hot or probably when a lot
of [ __ ] was going on about him so some
went on there and [ __ ] changed his
[ __ ] okay so I'm not getting a good
answer here the government formally
formally recognizes five religions
Buddhism Taoism Islam Protestantism and
Catholicism
they don't recognize Judaism in China no
they say the government only formally
recognizes five religions and I don't
even know what that means formally
recognizes but then there's this other
site but this sounds like [ __ ]
travel China guide.com
it sounds fake they say according
according to the latest survey eighty
five percent of Chinese people have
religious beliefs or had some religious
practices and only fifteen percent or
real atheists I'm not sure
so I'll just plead ignorance on this I'm
not sure but my understanding was in the
past and this could be wrong that China
was kind of like state sanctioned
atheism if you will but yeah I don't
know whatever by the way we have an
answer for my drink amaretto and ginger
ale that [ __ ] sounds good amaretto is
what like I don't know but it's
delicious I think that's the
after-dinner drink amaretto but it was
delicious I mean again going holy [ __ ]
yeah there's some drinks that just works
so well together yeah and then there's
others we spoke about this already but
the fruity drinks where you could have a
lot of them and then you don't even
realize like oh [ __ ] I had too much to
drink
cuz you have like six [ __ ] you know
hi-c cherry [ __ ] fruity fruity
McDuck's and then you drink it you're
like oh wow this is tasty and then you
die yep that was this hot chocolate shot
that was just like how many did you say
hot chocolate one the good amount you
brought you have water
next to you you're probably thirsty is
[ __ ] cuz you got that no I got butter
snap pretzels the opposite of water and
I still got my Dustbuster from last week
oh nice
don't start spraying it you'll get in
trouble I don't have my drink I usually
have a drink that keeps me awake but I
have a drink this time I had the sour
gummy worms right before I came on
sticking with our tradition the trollee
kind yeah I know I was like the
store-brand one whatever the CVS store
brand was it was delicious
those are good but you know the brand
troll yeah I had those two they're
pretty good too but I really like the
store brand more I just saw that um CVS
bought out some health like there's
definitely back door shady [ __ ] going on
with CVS yeah that's not good it's like
they made a deal with Aetna but like for
billions like crazy billions like I
heard on the news it was like CVS like
they try to say it on some like just
like right before Colbert show was about
to start it was like CBS buys whatever
for twenty nine point five billion
dollars next up Stephen clip I was like
whoa I feel like that should be a bigger
story because we don't have like that's
gonna lead to an even shittier health
care system I mean we have like we
already have a shitty health care system
because we have health insurance
companies that are [ __ ] people over
and instead of moving towards a Medicare
for All system we're just like now we're
just having these shitty health
insurance companies get even bigger and
more shittier so I mean this is like
with net neutrality too there's a
similar thing going on these companies
are just like the Internet service
providers are just some markets only
have like one option when it comes to an
Internet service provider so they give
the shittiest [ __ ] service ever
and then now you've given them more
power like you know with it with net
neutrality they could speed up sites and
slow down sites and [ __ ] and like
it's almost just like when you control
everything you can just like have a
senior product because I need something
extra we'll send somebody to help you
out next Thursday we what
so let's talk a little bit about Sam
cedar Sam cedar just got fired from
MSNBC he was a contributor there now you
know I'm pretty sure I don't need to
even add all these caveats but
nonetheless I will I'm not a big fan of
MSNBC in fact I think in recent years
they've become absolutely terrible
they're basically the propaganda arm of
the Democratic Party Fox News is the
propaganda arm of the Republican Party
in CNN you know carries water for the
establishment across the board for the
Democratic Party and the Republican
Party and they do their old school
neutrality bias but you know MSNBC they
suck their bed and it's you understand
that it's not the same thing as MSNBC
does not have a progressive bias or a
liberal bias or a left-wing bias because
if you're a news outlet and you are
conservative or you're liberal or you're
anywhere on the spectrum that's fine you
can have an ideological perspective but
my beef with MSNBC is that they're the
Democratic Party apologists so in other
words when the Democrats go right-wing
and when they're massively corporatists
MSNBC is there to pretend like that's
not the case and to say no no this is as
far left as you can go is just standard
Democrat line so I'm not a big fan MSNBC
now Sam cedar you know he's part of the
t whitey Network on part of the TYT
Network we've both been for years even
though that's the case I've had a grand
total of zero conversations with Sam
cedar I have you know no relationship or
line of communication with him
whatsoever and you know truth be told he
kind of in the last year or so has gone
after Jimmy Dore quite a bit now Jimmy
Dore is
is a friend of mine he's also part of
the TYT Network and you know Sam cedar
has basically said about jimmy dore he
he opposes the fact that in his mind
jimmy dore has done a full false
equivalence between Hillary Clinton and
Donald Trump and you know Jimmy couldn't
bring himself to vote for Hillary
Clinton and he votes if we continued to
argue against Hillary Clinton even after
the primary so I think Sam took issue
with that and he has repeatedly and
aggressively gone after Jimmy door so
all this being said basically what I'm
trying to do is set the table here and
say I don't really know the guy I don't
really know if I like him he's been a
little douchey to a friend of mine Jimmy
Dore and I think he's kind of
mischaracterized some of his arguments
but the reason he got fired was complete
and utter [ __ ] so here's why he was
fired this is a tweet of his from 2009
don't care regarding Polanski but I hope
if my daughter has ever raped it is by
an older truly talented man with a great
sense of I'm not even gonna try to
pronounce that Meese on scene I have a
feeling that the scene is pronounced
weird because it's you know my song-song
or whatever the [ __ ] but anyway what
he's doing here is he's mocking people
on the Left who were defending child
rapist Roman Polanski so I mean and it's
actually pretty obvious because I'm not
sure there's a single person on earth
who would want to see their daughter
raped so like to say I hope if my
daughter is raped like the guy who does
it has talent
it's obviously satire and Sam you know
did a segment where he spoke about how
I'm being attacked by people on the far
right and they're mischaracterizing this
tweet
and here's the rest of the context at
the time that this tweet was sent out
there was some sort of a [ __ ]
petition or list or whatever to allow
Polanski back in the country and not
arrest them and all that [ __ ] so Sam is
attacking those people who are flippant
about a child rapist but MSNBC said we
don't care we don't want it we don't
want to hear any dissent or any trouble
or any rumblings online about how we're
defending somebody who said something
that we don't like so we're just gonna
[ __ ] it just you know close your eyes
cover your ears just say go away fired
Sam go away the person who's responsible
for bringing this tweet back up to try
to smear Sam is this guy Mike Serna
[ __ ] this guy is a clown of a human
being I mean he's he's an absolute joke
he's a you know far right-wing guy he
was big-time on the Trump train and he's
just a weirdo he's like semi conspiracy
theorist obvious idiot so here's the
part of this that gets under my skin
more than anything else I tweeted this
so Sam cedar gets fired over a joke but
idiot far right wingers like Serna vich
portray themselves as anti PC police
snowflake fighting free speech warriors
[ __ ] you Mike you [ __ ] loathsome
smear merchant because that's what he is
either he's an idiot
and he didn't realize that this wasn't a
joke or he realized that but he didn't
care and he wanted to smear him to get a
left-winger fired
so that tweet encapsulates exactly how I
feel about this the same people who
cloak themselves in the Constitution in
the First Amendment and shriek from the
rooftops
that all they care about their so
principal than all we care about is free
speech and in the fridge change of ideas
and then the second they think they can
get somebody on the left for something
taken out of context that they find
offensive
they like cackling hyenas over a carcass
they call for this person to get fired
it is as hypocritical as could possibly
be now the plot thickens
Cassandra Fairbanks see right here the
tweet that was at me Cassandra Fairbanks
she's a interesting character she
supported Bernie Sanders in the primary
then she went full-on Trump train
afterwards now listen if you're somebody
who supported Bernie and then you
couldn't bring yourself to vote at all
in the general election I I can
understand that I don't agree with you
but I get where you're coming from if
you're somebody who voted for Bernie and
then said even as far I'm gonna vote for
Gary Johnson okay I think is a little
weird but I still kinda see where you're
coming from if you voted for Jill Stein
I definitely see where you're coming
from I'm in New York I voted for Jill
Stein now I said a million times if I
wasn't in New York if I was in a what
could be a swing state I would have
sucked it up and voted for Hillary but
bottom line is if you went from voting
for Bernie to nobody I get it if you
went from voting for Bernie to Jill I
get it if you went from voting for
Bernie to Gary Johnson I barely get that
one but I still kind of get it if you
went from going to Bernie to sucking it
up and voting for Hillary I get it but
if you went from Bernie to Trump I don't
get it you're just wrong you just like
went to an ideology that's like the
polar opposite because even the most
charitable interpretation of Trump's
campaign would be okay maybe he's a
little bit economically populist like he
won't do trade deals but at the same
time he says he wants to lower wages he
literally said that in debate in a
debate that wages are too high and then
of course there's the open imperialism I
mean you know Trump was calling for
taking out their families which means
killing civilians in the Middle East on
purpose talking about killing of
families of Isis he opened
called for torture so there's no like to
go from Bernie to Trump is like what
it's just it's just like really really
really dim and it shows you're not
really a deep thinker but anyway she
said oh look the left finally cares
about free speech now that it's a joke
about pedophilia I find by the way that
multiple right-wingers came at me with
this when I tweeted against Serna [ __ ]
and it's [ __ ] hilarious because it
does it doesn't doesn't take much for me
to prove these idiots wrong I have
segments where I defended my LOI
innopolis free speech
I have segments defending ben shapiro
and steven crowder in fact i make a
point of doing segments defending the
speech of people i disagree with
why because i'm principled and because i
actually care about this issue i don't
want people d platform i don't want
people censored i don't want people
fired over jokes you know i don't want
even if they have genuinely odious
opinions so i tweeted back at her here
we go again hi Cassandra here's the the
left me defending my low speech I
defended across the board now you send
me your defense of left wingers on free
speech grounds by the way haven't heard
back from her yet by the way Paul Joseph
Watson also you know became at me
originally and said well I understand
why MSNBC fired him the joke and he put
that in quotation marks was about child
rape well to Paul Joseph Watson's credit
he's by the way the prison planet guy
who's in affiliate with Alex Jones he
did flip and he he tweeted support for
Sam cedar after I showed him the context
number one that it was a joke but also
said to him look even if it wasn't a
joke the whole point of caring about
free speech which Paul Joseph Watson you
know he makes a big thing about that he
says it's like a defining feature of his
ideology the whole [ __ ] point of it
is to defend people who you personally
find odious it's so easy for all of us
to just [ __ ] go out there when we
agree with somebody and talk about free
speech free speech free speech the real
test of your principles is are you going
to apply
in the tough situations and then by the
way for Cassandra to say oh look the
left finally cares about free speech now
that it's jokes about pedophiles
actually no Cassandra the ACLU which is
generally regarded as a pretty left
organization they've defended in court
neo-nazis they're defending milo in
court right now
you know glenn greenwald same thing
super consistent on his stance with
speech
TJ kirk consistent on his stance with on
free speech you know even a guy like
janky augur of the young turks he's done
segments defending ben shapiro and when
there were people on the social justice
warrior authoritarian left trying to get
ben shapiro to not speak at a college
Genki ogre did a segment saying no i
don't agree with that um so it's just
not true when they tried oh now you care
about his speech no I've cared about it
all along which is why I did segments
defending my law why I always make a
point to defend people who I despise
they on the other hand do not with the
exception of course of Paul Joseph
Watson who originally was kind of on the
fences if not against Sam cedar and then
we flipped him by showing him the
context of it now it gets even funnier
look at this Mike Stern of itch blocked
me when he read my tweet that absolutely
owned his punk ass this one okay he saw
this tweet and insta block insta block
and then look at this next one here look
at this I reported this tweet for
targeted harassment do not reply to it
friends it's what they want they play
the victim reported as reported as it's
harassment of me and inciting harassment
are you [ __ ] kidding me
so in other words I attack this guy for
being a little snowflake snowflake Serna
[ __ ] are your feelings hurt are you
twig
do you need a safe space I attack was
being snowflake and then he instantly
proves my point
by the way I've literally blocked zero
people on Twitter I've literally
reported zero people on Twitter and the
number of people I've gotten fired over
a joke zero mic Tsarevich instant
instable locked me and then instantly
tried to get me if banned from Twitter
or suspended simply for calling him an
idiot right winger and a loathsome smear
merchant and for accurately pointing out
that he's the right wing PC police he's
a social injustice warrior he is a
snowflake by the way that's the new
that's the new name for Mike Serna [ __ ]
snowflake Serna [ __ ] snowflake
sorowitsch he gets so sad when you
called him out on his hypocrisy and he
literally got a lefty fired for a joke
he got somebody fired for an
out-of-context joke from 2009 I don't
want to hear another [ __ ] word from
these hypocrites on the far right about
free speech or the First Amendment and
by the way to be clear I understand that
this is not about the legal the legality
of the First Amendment this isn't an
actual this isn't actually about the law
that's clear I understand that everybody
understands that because MSNBC has a
right to fire or hire anybody they want
for whatever reason or non reason they
want but it's about defending the
principle of it so this isn't about the
the legality of it it's about the
principle of it but the I've never seen
such bigger hypocrites and you know to
go back to the Cassandra Fairbanks one
for a second here let's say for a second
it was true that I was a hypocrite and I
had never defended right-wingers for
their speech
her answer in this in that situation is
still oh I guess I I want to be an equal
and opposite hypocrite because look
she's saying oh look the left finally
cares about free speech now that it's
but jokes about pedophilia but has she
said anything in favor of Sam cedar
saying hey look I think the left are
hypocrites on this but I just want
everybody to know I support Sam cedar
here because he got fired over and out
of context joke and that's [ __ ] up
nope she didn't say that at all so even
if it were true that I was a hypocrite
which obviously it's not cuz I've done
countless segments defending the free
speech of right-wingers what she's
saying here is a non-response what she's
saying here is I like being a hypocrite
as well just from the other angle so by
the way on Twitter hashtag snowflake
Serna [ __ ] like let's get this going
here and MSNBC shame on you shame on you
for capitulating just because some
idiots on the fringes of the Internet
are making hypocritical arguments and
taking [ __ ] out of context shame on you
for saying I don't want to have any
problems ever for any reason whatsoever
so I'm just gonna cover my eyes cover my
ears and say just fire him get rid of
Sam get rid of him
so um MSNBC should [ __ ] hire Sam
cedar right back immediately and again
you're talking to a guy I really have no
opinion of cedar haven't spoken to him
ever he's kind of been douchey to jimmy
dore i think he kind of is
mischaracterizing some of his arguments
whether that's on purpose or not
whatever but he shouldn't have been
fired for what he said what he said was
a joke and it was taking it taken out of
context and by the way even if he did
say something that would genuinely load
some I still don't think he should get
fired
I mean MSNBC has had on as contributors
literal roman polanski
[Music]
apologists and I think that's absolutely
odious and disgusting that they have
that opinion but by the way I still I'm
not gonna go out of my way to what try
to get those people fired I don't give a
[ __ ] they're [ __ ] and they're
[ __ ] rape apologists just like Serna
[ __ ] look at this one by the way how
ironic is it that this [ __ ] [ __ ] who
has [ __ ] like this in his past that he
said is trying to get other people fired
because he's offended by their jokes
have you guys ever tried raping a girl
without using force try it what what try
it Mike
try it it's basically impossible
date rape does not exist are you [ __ ]
kidding me so this is by the way an
opinion that's absolutely disgusting and
odious now am I gonna try to put
together a [ __ ] petition to get this
idiot fired from whatever dumbass
ventures he's engaged in right now but
you know whoever has employed this [ __ ]
am I gonna you know pile on and try to
get this guy fired from whatever he's
doing no because I'm not a load some
clown like he is I'm not trying to muck
up outrage to paying somebody's
livelihood over their head this guy look
this is a genuinely disgusting opinion
and he is literally a rape apologist
this is the definition of being a rape
apologist so you know what I'll do about
this I will call him a rape apologist
I'm not gonna start a petition to try to
get him fired I'm not gonna [ __ ] try
to ruin his life because he's a douche
but again cuz I'm consistent on [ __ ]
like this and these guys are not so Mike
Serna [ __ ]
hashtag snowflake Serna [ __ ] he's
feeling to her Twiggy needs a safe space
snowflake Serna [ __ ] not another
[ __ ] word about free speech or the
First Amendment not another [ __ ]
Cassandra Fairbanks not another [ __ ]
word you are hypocrites it's absolutely
disgusting it's pathetic and MSNBC
should hire Sam cedar back immediately
so there was a big story that broke late
last week about General Michael Flynn
who was a top trump official of course
and then he was fired he pled guilty to
robert muller and is willing to talk to
get a deal so this should absolutely
blew up online social media was on fire
over it and this is I think a big story
now yet again everybody is framing it as
a continued part of the Russia Gate
story but you're about to see how it
pretty clearly is not that it's robert
muller effectively going after Trump and
his administration for corruption
now they recently did this with Madoff
or they were able to get him he's a
pretty openly corrupt scumbag willing to
take money from whoever and do their
bidding in the government he had proven
ties to pro-russia elements in Ukraine
he was more than willing to do their
bidding now with Flynn I actually
thought the first announcement
announcement meant when Muller got
metaphor I thought that was going to be
Muller saying we got Flynn because Flynn
there is just a plethora of evidence
that he's probably the most corrupt of
the people in the Trump administration
who are all part of this fiasco well now
it looks like they got Flynn and they
flipped Flynn and it's gonna be
interesting to see what he has to say
and who he's giving up to try to protect
his own ass so this is getting really
interesting now let me give you the
specifics of this case and you'll see
why this isn't just a Russia story this
is much bigger than that so this is from
BuzzFeed busts a little bit of BuzzFeed
news
they say it was Kushner who told Flynn
to make calls about Israel UN vote
source says hmm that's interesting
the
president son-in-law prompted the
December 22nd 2016 call to Russia's
ambassador that is the focus of Flynn's
guilty plea Friday Jared Kushner
president Trump's son-in-law called
Michael Flynn in December 2016 and told
him to call members of the UN Security
Council in an effort to stop a vote on a
resolution critical of Israeli
settlement policy according to a person
who was present in the room when Flynn
took the call
Flynn then called Russia's then
ambassador to the United States to seek
his assistance and later lied to the FBI
about having done so according to
documents filed in federal court Friday
by Special Counsel Robert Muller that
explained Flynn's guilty plea of lying
to federal agents okay so this didn't
happen originally they said well this
was when Trump was a candidate turns out
that was misreporting it didn't happen
when Trump was a candidate this happened
when Trump was president-elect Trump so
in other words there's no crime
whatsoever when you have you know an
administration that's incoming being in
contact with world officials wherever
they may be in whatever country they may
be a part of and the crime wasn't that
the crime was apparently that Flynn lied
about making those phone calls after the
fact
so really the cover-up is the actual
crime here but let me continue and give
you more information because there's
more stuff that I think is very telling
according to the chargesheet Flynn on
December 22nd 2016 asked kis Lee act to
use Moscow's status as a permanent
Security Council member to delay or
defeat the pending resolution and
subsequently lied about those
discussions with the FBI it's unclear
why Flynn would have lied but there are
laws that could criminalize such
behavior behavior such as the Logan Act
a scarcely enforced law that prohibits
unauthorized unauthorized citizens from
negotiating with foreign governments
that have a dispute with the United
States in the run-up
to the vote both Flynn and Kushner
called several officials of Security
Council member states in order to block
or delay the resolution Flynn personally
called foreign ambassadors on the
Security Council including
representatives of Uruguay and Malaysia
okay so the issue in question here is a
UN resolution non-binding UN resolution
that condemns Israel for their illegal
settlements so Flynn at the behest of
Kushner calls all these different
governments at the UN and says listen I
want you to vote this way on this for
Russia they said we want you two to come
out on the side of Israel we don't want
you to condemn their illegal settlements
and by the way Russia didn't do that
Russia said we are going to condemn
Israel's illegal settlements so they
didn't they didn't do it but they were
calling not just Russia a bunch of
different governments to say that and
again the issue they were doing it over
was Israel now you get the sense when
you listen to everything in mainstream
media about this that they frame this as
solely a Russia scandal but this isn't
Kushner telling Flynn to call other
countries at the UN to try to get them
to vote a certain way on Russia
sanctions for example this has nothing
to do with Russia policy-wise it has to
do with Israel so it's not that Flynn
and the Trump administration are doing
the bidding of Russia which again is
what all the coverage implies on this
it's that they're doing the bidding of
Israel but it's a it really is genuinely
astonishing how whenever somebody's our
ally full pass full 100% pass where I'm
gonna talk about that angle of the story
you know a point I've made repeatedly in
the midst of this Russia hysteria is
well you want to talk about collusion
and you want to talk about corruption
how about the fact that Donald Trump
opened up about eight new businesses in
Saudi Arabia while he was campaigning to
become president Trump when he became
president Saudi Arabia paid his hotels
two hundred and seventy thousand dollars
first stays at the hotel that costs
nowhere near two hundred and seventy
thousand dollars you want to know why
they're giving him that much money
because it's [ __ ] pay-to-play
corruption and then lo and behold Donald
Trump approves a weapons deal that's
worth a hundred and ten billion dollars
to Saudi Arabia so you want to talk
about collusion you want to talk about
corruption how about the fact that he's
100% sold out to Saudi Arabia and we
know as a matter of fact that when he
was campaigning he blamed them for 9/11
he said repeatedly I think it's their
fault then why'd you just give them over
a hundred billion dollar weapons deal
could it be because you have eight new
businesses registered there could it be
because you just took two hundred and
seventy thousand dollars from them at
your hotel and they're paying you to do
favors for them but nobody says there's
a Saudi Arabia
you know scandal going on now nobody
says there's an Israel scandal going on
now when the administration says Jared
Kushner tells Flynn
don't let them criticize Israeli
settlements now let me ask you a
question why would Kushner do that it's
almost like he has an open line of
communication to Netanyahu or somebody
in a top position in the Israeli
government and they told Kushner hey go
to try to block the UN from doing this
it's almost like that's exactly what
happened but nobody is saying hey we
need more evidence on that we need to
dig deeper into that they're all framing
it from the Russia angle how can you
frame it from the Russia angle when they
ask multiple countries Russia was just
one of the countries and Russia didn't
even vote the way you wanted them to
vote how can this be framed as a rush of
scandal it makes no [ __ ] sense now
imagine for a second the the story was
flipped and it was they were trying to
get the UN to do something in terms of
Russia policy well then everybody would
be saying that's it we got to find the
recording of the phone call that Kushner
had with the top Russian government
official because this is the collusion
that we're talking about from the
highest levels
they're doing the bidding of the Russian
government but when that's the case with
the Israeli government [ __ ] crickets
nothing now by the way let me be clear
about something the reality of the
situation is this isn't when they were
campaigning this is when they were this
is when it was the incoming
administration this was president-elect
Trump in his administration so in other
words what that means is whether or not
I like it
none of this stuff is really illegal you
know we might not like that the incoming
administration is already kind of
getting involved in in the international
political scene or even if they were
already getting involved like directly
in the national political scene we might
not like it and I might despise the fact
that there are oh they say are seemingly
doing Israel's bidding directly and
trying to influence other countries in
that in that direction but I don't I
don't think there's a crime there you
know I don't I just think it's [ __ ]
gross and [ __ ] up now where there are
crimes for sure it's already been proven
that Michael Flynn and this is likely
the reason why he flipped not just
because of this because I'm sure they
held this over his head like why'd you
lie to us about having connections with
with other countries as you're the
incoming administration why'd you lie to
us about making phone calls to people at
the UN so they're gonna hold that over
his head but also it's been proven
Michael Flynn took over $500,000 from
the government of Turkey and in return
for that what did he do he pressured the
administration he pressured Donald Trump
to snub the Kurds and not arm the Kurds
and not back the Kurds from taking back
cities that were held by Isis so do you
understand that is very important in
other words everybody in the
administration by the way Democrat and
Republican seemingly agreed okay our
number one ally in the region is the
Kurds we know they're not jihadists
they're fighting against jihadists and
this is why we've given them
humanitarian aid we've armed them in
certain circumstances and
we back then fighting Isis well guess
what Turkey despises the Kurds they
always have they always have because
there's a separatist Kurdish movement in
Turkey
so they view Kurd the courage as
terrorists so we're allies with turkey
turkey always hated that we were backing
the Kurds in the fight against Isis they
despised it so what would you do if your
turkey in that circumstance I don't know
let me pay somebody from the incoming
government five hundred thousand dollars
or more and get him to pressure people
in the administration mr. almond general
so you got to take my word seriously on
military affairs he gets in there he
pressures Donald Trump and other people
in the administration we're not gonna
arm the Kurds I think it's a bad idea
really why do you think it's a bad idea
they're fighting Isis a new phone who
dis I don't know but don't arm the Kurds
well lo and behold you trace it back he
took over five hundred thousand dollars
from the Turkish government so by the
way that's this kind of thing that
people are afraid of with Russia and
that everybody's talking about with
Russia like oh my god Russia's buying
influence in the government the only
difference is there's not there's no
evidence there yet that there's a direct
line from the Russian government you
know to the Trump administration and
they're doing the bidding there's a
chance that is the case with Flynn
because he's obviously totally corrupt
and willing to do [ __ ] like that he
already did it but in the case of Turkey
the evidence is already there that he
100% did the bidding of a Turkish
Turkish government and pushed them in a
direction policy-wise and in the case of
Turkey it's particularly egregious in
the case of Israel it's bad but in the
case of Israel that we have no evidence
of the Israeli government giving money
to Jared Kushner or to Michael Flynn to
do their bidding as far as we know it
was just phone calls and they say hey do
this for us and then they do it but when
you have a quid pro quo and he's taking
money from the Turkish government then
guilty we got him and by the way there's
another story that it wasn't just that
he was there were they gave him over
five hundred thousand dollars to try to
push the administration to not arm the
Kurds it's also I just learned about
this the other week he they wanted him
to kidnap a Turkish preacher who now
lives in America Gulen remember when
there was the attempted coup in Turkey
well air Dewan blame that
on a guy named Gulen and that guy lives
in the US he thinks that oh that you
know this guy was trying to overthrow me
and he would become the leader of Turkey
whether or not that's true or not I
genuinely don't know but they wanted
Michael Flynn to kidnap this guy in the
middle of the night in the US and send
him to Turkey again for a tremendous
amount of money so they know that stuff
about Flint they could hold that over
Flint's head and say listen son you're
going to jail for a really long time and
so when you put Flint in a corner like
that it's like okay I'll give you I'll
give you whoever you want for whatever
reason you want and it looks like what
he's doing is he's giving up kushnir and
what he's saying is I was ordered by
Kushner to contact Russia to contact
Uruguay to contact Malaysia to contact
other people at the UN other countries
at the UN and to try to get them to go
against the resolution condemning Israel
for the easily illegal settlements and
again the crime in that respect is not
that the new administration is
contacting people from other countries
leaders of other countries that's that's
not the crime in that in that part the
crime is that the crime is that they
tried to cover it up and he didn't tell
the FBI about it if he was just open up
front about it and said yeah we were
when we were the incoming administration
we made the phone calls that might be
you know not cool but that's not
something that's a crime it's a crime
when you tried to cover it up and you
weren't truthful with the FBI after the
fact so the cover-up is worse than the
crime in that respect but there are
other crimes that they have them on that
are way worse which are what I just
described that the turkey situation for
one and let me be crystal clear about
something and I've maintained this all
along if you want to frame the Russia
narrative as Donald Trump and his
administration are incredibly corrupt
and they're willing to do the bidding of
foreign governments yes as has been
proven but specifically in the case of
Donald Trump there's evidence of him you
know having mafia connections true
there's evidence of him doing the
bidding of Russian oligarchs true the
one aspect of the Russian narrative that
I think isn't true because there's no
evidence of it is that Donald Trump is
committing treason and and he's Putin's
puppet is another way they they phrase
it because here's the reality of it he
hasn't done the bidding of the Russian
government policy-wise in any respect in
fact he's done the opposite there's been
so much pressure on him over this Russia
hysteria that across the board he is
like for example Congress passed an
increase in sanctions on Russia Trump
obviously vetoed it right because here's
a guy who's in the potty who's a Putin
puppet wrong he signed it so we increase
sanctions on Russia now people say oh my
god but you didn't implement those
sanctions that's actually not true there
was a delay in implementing them but
they implemented them so let's get our
facts straight on that it's not accurate
to say oh we didn't implement the
sanctions furthermore if there was gonna
be a deal with Russia obviously right
front and center would be the Exxon
angle to the deal
there's a multitrillion-dollar oil deal
that Russia had with Exxon now Obama I
think they had approved it but then they
axed it as soon as stuff went to [ __ ]
with Crimea well guess what Trump comes
in and he picks Rex Tillerson the former
CEO of Exxon Mobil to be Secretary of
State
so everybody myself included goes
[ __ ] they're gonna they're gonna do
the bidding of the Russian government
they're gonna approve that oil deal
guess what they didn't approve the deal
so if the oil deal that's at the heart
of the corruption scandal with the
Russian government specifically didn't
happen and the sanctions have been
increased and Trump bombed Assad who's
Russia's top Ally you do realize for
there to be a deal with the Russian
government the Russian government has to
get something out of it right so that's
why the narrative of specifically
talking about the Russian government
makes no sense and there's the added
angle of putting all the corruption and
everything aside what's the what are the
proper
policies to do with Russia well I would
argue I don't want to escalate with them
further so I don't want to add more
sanctions on top of them I don't want to
bomb the Syrian government
I wouldn't approve the oil deal but
that's a slightly different part of this
but in other words I would want to
de-escalate with them but now because of
the Russia hysteria Trump is in a
position where even if he does
deescalate with them then everybody's
gonna paint him as Putin's puppet even
further and they're gonna say well
that's that's obvious proof of your sold
out to him so Trump is massively
incentivized now to be more hawkish and
be more aggressive and escalate further
with Russia so that's what Democrat
that's the this pickle the Democrats are
now in the implication of their
arguments that he's such a Putin puppet
is that now the only way to prove you're
not is to escalate further and increase
tensions and move us closer to World War
three now again I do think Trump has
deals with foreign governments all over
the world I mean he his his products are
made in at least 12 different countries
so is he doing favors for those
countries and because he has personal
business dealings with him absolutely
and so he's already in violation of the
emoluments clause there's no doubt about
that and in terms of Russia yes I think
he does have ties to Oleg arcs there and
he's doing their bidding I just don't
think that it goes as far as Putin and
doing Putin's bidding cuz he hasn't done
Putin's bidding but his policies have
not helped Putin so again I think this
is being misreported as a Solia russia
scandal if anything it's more of an
Israel scandal because they were trying
to get the policy that Israel wanted but
even that I don't think is true because
there's really no violation of the law
there so it's it's not a that aspect of
this is not a scandal the real scandal
is yes Amana Ford was massively corrupt
yes Flynn is massively corrupt I don't
deny that fleeing in an instant would do
you know the bidding of any foreign
government as he proved he did with
Turkey so all that is true and but we
need to stick to what the facts say and
right now the
facts are this is more of a turkey
scandal than a Russia scandal and it's
more of an Israel scandal than a Russia
scandal but again even on the Israel
well hello everybody yo hey y'all doing
I'm not gonna eat this week oh I've said
it's disgusting so sorry to everybody if
it's disgusting oh you're saying eating
on during the podcast yeah I thought you
meant eating in like in general like
you're not gonna eat anything I'm done
eating forever all right so you'll be
gone in a week although I have a
tendency even when I'm like talking to
people of importance um to talk with my
mouth full but I feel like if I do this
like as I'm talking I'm sort of I'm sort
of like yeah yeah you know it's weird
because I'm super specific about the
things that piss me off or like it's
it's really weirdly like detailed like
if somebody's chewing in an obnoxious
way but it's like over the top of a
noxious and its really loud mouth noises
then I don't mind if it's like almost
like they're rubbing it in your face
like yeah I'm eating and it's gross like
and even if you eat things that are have
like a crunchy noise like a loud
crunching noise where like a carrot or
something like I know cackles like if
you're eating a cackling hyena know if
you so like that doesn't bother me if
it's but if it's like almost like I hear
it but you're trying to hide it then
yeah like it or if it's like mmm almost
I got like a moist sound to it like a
wet [ __ ] let's yeah then I'm at a
toes or some [ __ ] yeah yeah like and
it's weird because some and I think it
depends on my mood too you know you know
I would try and different things I would
try and eat like potato chips in class I
think oh that's hard and it's hard
because you try and eat like chewing
with your mouth closed
yeah but but you you still hear the
sound of like the chip like breaking in
your mouth yeah and you know that like
ask people around you it can you hear
that yeah I could still hear that
speaking of that I actually should talk
about this right up front so Leon who
makes the Kyle out-of-context videos
yeah he he messaged me the other day and
he's like is it true that Pringles taste
like the original Pringles taste like
McDonald's fries and I was like no
that's not true he just randomly asked
you that's yeah so let me ask you like
what what comes to your mind when I say
that is your gut reaction like no or I
would have to have them because I
haven't had regular Pringles in a while
and I almost feel like cause you're
telling me that they taste like
McDonald's french fries I'm sort of like
yeah they do taste like McDonald's
french fries and I'm starting to
remember the taste so yeah I don't think
they I do that today I tested it today
oh really yes that conclusion is a
little bit but but here's here's the
curveball I'm gonna throw at you I
generally don't like original Pringles
that much but I love McDonald's fries so
it's weird like I see it I see it like I
taste it like yeah they're they're
similar but I don't know like on the
hierarchy of chips
I feel like Pringles is solidly at the
bottom for me like I believe in it I
mean it is a chip but it's not like a
it's not like a you know you think of
chips you don't think of Pringles
they're trying to do their own thing
like look with can and it's like oh okay
you're like a little different it's like
remember viento of Vienna fingers yes
like that's a cookie but I don't think
yeah I don't think of that or Milano's
like that's a cookie but like someone
would say like no that's it's a big
[ __ ] fancy cookie like it is its own
thing yeah yeah does have its own kind
of category it's like I [ __ ] the cookie
corn is not really candy it's like it's
something it's don't like category yeah
but like the Pringles in the hierarchy
like you name any other kind of chip and
I'm like I like that [ __ ] more like yeah
I'm thinking teredo relays Doritos yeah
any any other [ __ ] even like Utz nuts
chips
have you ever had the Dell remember the
deli chips and like the purple bag and
it says like deli and like they're
letters they're youth that used to trick
me so much that if anybody I don't know
if that's just the East Coast thing
those purple chips the ones that said
deli on them you know it's weird some
things are just East Coast and I didn't
know you know what is
I just found out was just an East Coast
thing what when I say Drake's do you
know what I'm talking about of course
yeah they're so they're like those hope
like those only east coast don't tell me
that's only east coast like the devil
dogs actually east coast so I looked it
up and Drake's is a like a bakery
company that started in Harlem and on
the hostess box you would see Drake's
but hostess bought out Drake's and
Drake's was just the East Coast thing so
like nobody in the Midwest that I asked
knew about Drake's okay it is now a fact
that if you're not on the East Coast
you [ __ ] up yeah your life is wack
yeah like you there's no words to
describe how much you [ __ ] up if you
didn't have Drake's
yeah because Lakes was the [ __ ] a
hundred piers how good the East Coast is
like if your [ __ ] is good outside of the
East Coast it'll eventually end up in
the East Coast like chick-fil-a was
popping everywhere else and they were
like we gotta bring this to the East
Coast now was that that puts the stamp
of approval on that [ __ ] you know I
didn't know about this either but
apparently like outside of New York and
actually Chicago - even though Chicago
is different with the pizzas deep-dish
pizza but like there's a lot of places
where you can't get a good slice of
pizza I do yeah outside of New York you
can't get a good slice of pizza yeah and
like the places that people will tell
you good they like preface it that [ __ ]
with like your book yeah this is the
best around here yeah okay cool so the
same way like yeah bagel same thing
can't get an egg sandwich like you know
how you could you know you can't get a
bacon egg and cheese on a roll anywhere
else outside the first thing I did when
I came back to New York was I'd stopped
at that deli in White Plains and got
just like some Mexican ass deli no
offense to Mexicans but like this [ __ ]
is all Mexicans in there and it was just
a bacon egg and cheese on a roll with
some salt pepper ketchup it was like 295
and I was like make sure you scramble
the eggs so there's a deli so they buy
me breakfast what do you go to Dunkin
so you go to like [ __ ] Tim Hortons
like some [ __ ] that is just like like
egg or McDonald's breakfast and you just
get an egg that's fake as well it's not
the same [ __ ] yeah you can't well it's
not like I don't it's not I don't even
dislike the bacon I get cheese from from
Dunkin Donuts or McDonald's but it's not
the same thing yeah no nothing against
it as like a deli like a real deli [ __ ]
like a role that he just pulls out of
the plastic thing he just pops open the
thing and puts his hand in the roll
thing cuts it open so yeah there's this
thing here what are we missing it on the
East Coast cuz there's some [ __ ] we're
missing it like they'll hate us in
California I don't know if you ever had
this but my wife had this and she put me
on to it we went to California it's
called Del Taco
oh I heard about that it's like it's
like a Taco Bell I think there's one
around me though I think there's one in
the on the East Coast
I don't think so yeah oh no no no I'm
thinking of death okay no I tell
frisking it's like a fancy taco I'm
thinking of there's one called bar taco
night oh yeah bar taco is started to
expand outside of New York okay um but
that's like some some fast food Taco
Bell type of [ __ ] everywhere soccer
balls everywhere yeah yeah um in and out
it's not on the East Coast yet that's
right in a now it's not but I have to
say I know a bunch of people who went to
California and they're like listen I
can't wait to have this burger I've
heard amazing things the pictures of
in-and-out burgers are like on another
level gorgeous but then they have it and
they're like five guys is way better
yeah it's it's it's one of those things
where it's like you don't have a
in-and-out burger a lot so you want to
be like this [ __ ] is better but I think
Five Guys burger is better and Five Guys
fries are better which puts them way
over the top
what's the other one the other way check
Shake Shack
okay Shake Shack there's a Shake Shack
in Cross County in Yonkers right yep
yeah okay so I ate that that wasn't good
but Five Guys was still better than that
now you're buggin you're buggin oh I'm
not we're gonna can't agree on it let's
launch a war in the comment section here
all right so a Meyer you need to do a
poll on your [ __ ] I'll do it because you
can do ya do
Twitter poll just do well do five guys
in and out Shake Shack you think we
should know though I know this because
we already but it's like you gotta throw
in and out in there that's that but I
got like I got like five people son
that'll just be like don't eat it's not
even like you're you're buggin if you
try they're not open-minded they're not
they haven't if they're on some [ __ ]
like I can't wait to have this burger
it's gonna be the best thing ever and
then they had it and they're like five
guys is way better
no cuz here's the thing it's almost not
even a debate like Shake Shack
I'm almost trying to say don't even put
that in the debate because people have
had the debate to not even put Shake
Shack in that category with in and out
and five guys because it's on a
different level it's like they try to
say the Shake Shack is gourmet no yeah
that's why shakes my words right Shake
Shack yeah sha ck right yeah yeah as
opposed to like some like Xers don't hit
me with the [ __ ] like you got to be a
hundred
I can't tweet some [ __ ] out with a typo
alright check it
are you checking it now you check it
well okay so she this is did you get
this picture I sent you I did that's not
great oh my god you look like the tip of
a penis are you are you checking sick
sick or no you check it I'm typing it in
on on Twitter
I don't want microphone making noise
okay Sh a ke Sh ACK okay and now five
guys is easy to spell Five Guys five
guys it's just a regular and then all
five guys in and out of IV e G Uys no
it's not five it what it is spelled it
spelled 5 f 5 ee not like the number 5
oh yeah okay that's fine and well then
turn it out is in - n mm-hmm
- out so in - space n no no no - yeah
just the letter n yeah
okay let's change the poll length what
do you think wins before you um do that
[ __ ] well I know that if people are
right five guys wins but then again -
hold on I'm not being fair because I
actually haven't had in and out I've had
Shake Shack I've had five guys in my
mind I liked five guys better
don't go mad all of them I feel like I'm
a burger connoisseur I'm not saying the
shake I'm not saying I didn't like the
Shake Shack one I love the Shake Shack
on and in fact when you go over all
restaurant like when you judge it based
on that you might have to go Shake Shack
just because their options are off the
chain like their options are crazy you
walk in and you're like this is perfect
like all the options have it just right
is it very simple but in terms of just
the burger I'm 100% going five guys okay
the bonnet Shake Shack is way better -
it's like a potato bun is way better I
don't know how you I know five guys good
with Shake Shack people have had the
conversation to not even put that in the
conversation with five guys and in and
out okay it's up we just we just sent it
out there I'm nervous
five guys let's go five guys I love you
five guys it's my Shake Shack well a lot
of people aren't gonna have Shake Shack
so that might not win it all depend
that's true there's a big West Coast
contingency - right that can [ __ ]
sway this [ __ ] also but not for nothing
it's almost split evenly between like
California Texas and New York so I got
everywhere covered okay son I tweeted
something like yesterday it was and it
blew up like I was a week go viral and
like the numbers on this [ __ ] thing
or ridiculous OD because I see all your
[ __ ] but I wasn't
I haven't been active on social too much
you ready for this besides today let me
tell you these knows I'm looking at the
tweet right now let me tell you these
numbers mm-hmm the number of impressions
it had six point six nine million what
that's the number of impressions so
that's like I think the number like it
showed up on that many feeds I guess
that's what impression means a number of
the number of retweets 53,000 I didn't
even see this 10s
like what the number of pictures you did
for some three to four thousand yeah it
was my dick no it's um Time magazine
tweeted Norway is the happiest country
in the world what's the secret and then
I said I see that tweet I quote tweeted
it and I said I can't believe that a
wealthy country with free health care
and education high wages a strong middle
class and nearly a month paid vacation
time by law is happy and that should you
two took off [ __ ]
crazy I saw that see I didn't see that
it that it blew the [ __ ] up like that I
think what happened was like you get so
since my accounts verified I get to see
when other verified accounts do [ __ ]
with it like if they like a tweet or
retweet as we drove and like what
happened is it looked like a bunch of
just like random ass people like
somebody who's like a writer somebody
who's like a local [ __ ] reporter you
know you go down the list of like kind
of minor like celebrities but they have
like 5,000 followers each about like
people like that kept retweeting it and
then it just kept getting [ __ ] pumped
into feeds that had like 5,000 or 10,000
followers and then all a bunch of their
people retweeted it just kept was like
[ __ ] wildfire it's by far and away
the biggest tweet I ever had I think the
one before this was not didn't hit
10,000 now we're talking 104 thousand
lights that's [ __ ] crazy
that's [ __ ] wild I know I'm
fascinated by that [ __ ] I'm so light
because like at my last job someone from
like the [ __ ] neighborhood or some
[ __ ] next to me tweeted something that
like that went viral and it had like
crazy amount of like likes and retweets
and I asked my ex bosses I was like can
I go like interview this dude cause that
must be [ __ ] crazy experience to go
from get in like one like it's an all of
a sudden you just got like however many
is stupid them out and they were like
all like they didn't give a [ __ ] about
it and I was like [ __ ] you guys man it's
like it's cool to hear about that [ __ ]
cuz you're one thing just like went
through so many eyeballs across the
whole [ __ ] world well I looked it up
I was like trying to wrap my mind around
that number six point six million
impressions and it goes up like it's
going up fast like if I look at this in
a day it'll go up another like two
million at least that's the trend so far
but like it's bigger than I think the
population of Colorado so like it's like
everybody in Colorado basically looked
at my tweet is what is how I interpreted
that that's [ __ ] definitely want the
news like in Norway definitely imagine
there's like a local news station in
Norway oh yeah
like I'll tell you about that these are
tweet is that are they talking Norway
probably I was me and my friend were
doing an offensive accents all week and
it was pretty funny
like I'd tweet him it or tweet him I'd
audio him on the iPhone oh yeah three
o'clock in the morning like this mug
from Africa and then I would I'd switch
it up and throw throw like Indian accent
in there together after a while right
what's that they all start to blend
together after a while yeah it's hard
like you got it you know what I notice
I'm better at accents if I do them like
at it out of nowhere I think of doing
one and then I do it but if I stop and
think about it for a little bit then I
can't do it mm-hmm like I have to you
have to hit me with like okay do
Scottish okay last let me tell you my
Scottish accent but if I stop and think
about it for three minutes you come back
I won't be able to do a Scottish accent
yeah it'll just be like a [ __ ] it all
goes to the same thing I used to have
that [ __ ] with um Christopher Walken
like it's not good cuz I'm doing right
now actually he's not bad that's pretty
good but like that's pretty good I
struggle with individuos yeah who would
you do I struggle with individuals oh
yeah you tell me to do individuals all
struggle I could I could do like places
like I could do different but I don't I
don't know if I have any individual ones
is that from you think you just heard
someone like say that accent one time I
think but you've heard it enough where I
was like I think I could copy that you
know like you hear Irish person talking
off you're like it yeah like I think I
could maybe do but you can never do it
long-term like I can't do it like if you
tell me to talk to you for three minutes
and an accent I can't do it I could talk
to Mike in ten seconds yeah because it
starts to get like exposed
like that doesn't really you'll miss big
one like you'll miss big words that
you're supposed to do sir a certain way
and you don't do it right and it's like
this is probably this is all falling
apart yeah
damn they should [ __ ] send you
something in the mail for having the
[ __ ] tweet that I mean think about a
postcard imagine like but they like
[ __ ] SuperDuper celebrities tweet
anything and it gets way more than this
that's very true you know like Kim
Kardashian's like hi I was in the mall
it's like [ __ ] 3.2 million retweets
like what the [ __ ]
yeah that's absurd how much [ __ ] that
they [ __ ] I mean it's just
fascinating that something could spread
like I was fascinating I was at the mall
and I was walking into Cole's I think or
something like that and there was like
five high school kids just like random
looking kids walking out of the store
like joking and they were like dabbing
and like just being like high school
kids they're just like just be like
[ __ ] kids and like one glasses on and
one just had like shaggy air and I said
to my wife I was just like it's just
[ __ ] wild there's so many people in
the world like yeah
like those are five kids right there
yeah I'll just if they have parents they
all have lots of stories yeah yeah and
like aunts and like they're in Kohl's
with us right now walking out like they
know about dabbing and they know about
like I was just like there's just so
many [ __ ] like there's so many
overwhelming yeah it's overwhelming yeah
even driving like if you're just like in
traffic just looking at like all the
different cars all the cars all the
different people in the car just going
through [ __ ] that you're going through
yeah it is an overwhelming thought like
how many how many people are going
through some really [ __ ] [ __ ] up
times right now - that's the crazier
yeah you look around and there's some
old dude is like 48 years old and you're
so it's time for ad pocalypse 2.0 on
YouTube everybody now
the first one as I've stated repeatedly
never really ended it just got less
shitty there was a brief period there
were we were on a blacklist secular talk
was on a blacklist
where we made no money even though we
had you know over five hundred thousand
views a day
nothing David Pakman was also on the
black list by the way they claim there's
not a black list they're reserved on
your block list there was a time where
they shut down all adds to our channel
but the bounce-back was hey we're making
absolutely nothing to well now it's a
sixty percent cut so be happy that you
at least got 40 percent that's where
we've been at and you guys have saved
the day by the way thank you so much
to all the patrons you have no idea how
much it means to me and how important it
is that you know you guys who are living
your life working going about your
business you care enough if you enjoy
this content to just throw like two
bucks a month or way I mean that means
so much it took me from not being able
to sleep because our entire business
collapsed in a day to saying oh okay
we've stabilized we've stabilized so
thank you to each and every one of the
people who support their show and I mean
that from the bottom of my heart um
now you now ad pocalypse is getting
worse so this is from reuters google
broadens takedown of extremist YouTube
videos it all hinges on what they mean
by extremist doesn't it alphabet inks
Google is the last in the last few
months has begun removing from YouTube
extremist videos that do not depend anat
depict violence or preach hate YouTube
said on Monday a major policy shift as
social media companies face increasing
pressure from
governments so they say YouTube terms
already banned terrorists from using it
so I've noticed that when you have the
word terrorist in a title instant
demonisation Isis instantly monetization
usually Israel Saudi Arabia instant
demonization sometimes we're able to
skirt the algorithms by you see those
weird letters I post in the titles
sometimes that effectively skirts the
algorithms and it stays monetized or at
least it stays monetized for a longer
period of time than it would have if I
didn't do that trick but sometimes they
catch on to it and they get rid of it
but they say the new policy keeps out
videos quote uploaded by others that
militants would likely try to distribute
if they could have accounts ok so do you
get that they're saying anything that
could potentially radicalize people
gonna get rid of it well let me ask you
guys a question
I've covered countless stories I just
did it this week of US drone strikes
that massacred civilians can that
possibly radicalize somebody yes 100% if
you're somebody let's say you know
somebody or your family was killed in a
drone strike and I'm covering a story
that explains the details of that and
how much the establishment does not care
in the US it's baked into the cake yeah
we kill civilians collateral damage
whatever it is what it is theoretically
can that story put somebody over the
edge and they become a militant yeah
yeah does that mean I shouldn't cover it
no it's a fact and I'm gonna cover it
because it's true did 99.99 I'm saying
the people who watch that are just
getting educated on what their
government is doing and also it makes it
so that they could potentially stop the
government from doing it we could fight
you try to stop the government from
doing so as massive potential upsides
but YouTube can technically look at that
look you're talking about drone strikes
that the US did that could radicalize
somebody sorry we're gonna we're gonna
have to take your video down we're gonna
and by the way though there's multiple
layers so just the first layer is D
monetization that's just the
first layer but then you get to you know
there's this scary new thing where
there's like protected mode and they put
people on and but then there's also a
mode where they try not to let your
go into the shared videos as much and
try not to ever promote your videos even
if it's relevant to what the keywords
people usually search for so there's
many layers of like de-facto censorship
and look in some instances nobody's
denying that there aren't actual hateful
videos on youtube like neo-nazi stuff or
you know Isis propaganda and stuff but
my arguments always been listen they're
not I totally get the D monetizing that
100% get it if they're literally like we
are in Isis and we want to be happy yeah
you could do monetize that no problem
but the idea of even pulling it down is
like why are you acting under the
assumption that when people look at that
video that they're automatically going
to want to join Isis when the
overwhelming majority people gonna look
at that like they would look at a
documentary on Hitler and they go oh you
guys are horrendous and we hate
you so the scrambled always sensor or D
platform or hide stuff it Det that's not
an instinct that makes sense man it
really does not alright let me give you
more they also say quote inflammatory
religious or supremacist content is
demonetised
so again now you're getting into where
do you draw that line supremacist
inflammatory religious or supremacist
content so that includes Isis obviously
al Qaeda what if it's just a very
conservative Muslim preacher what if
it's a very conservative Christian
preacher we cover Rick Wiles on this
show Rick Wiles the other day he was
saying how you know the left and the
Communists and the Muslims are the new
Nazis and they're coming to kill
Christians that's not true and that
could radicalize somebody should his
stuff be pulled down should his stuff be
pulled down that is supremacist content
inflammatory religious content when is
it just what is it supremacist content
when it comes to white supremacy like
okay neo-nazi sure what about somebody
niel Confederate what about somebody
who's just a run-of-the-mill racist
far-right person where do you draw the
line where do you draw it it there's now
they're inching that line more and more
towards I'd err on the side of caution
we want anybody to criticize us so just
hide as much stuff as possible D
monetize as much stuff as possible and
they also claim this my favorite part
quote their new policy does not affect
news clips or educational videos about
terrorism but YouTube will not always
have an easy time distinguishing experts
said on pointing to tactics such as
overlaying extremist commentary on news
footage to get around censors so in
other words if I'm talking about Isis
and I run some b-roll of Isis you know
talking or something on CNN that could
be demonetized and they're just lying
here when they say the new policy does
not affect news clips or educational
videos about terrorism I just tweeted
about this the other day one of the
shows recently we covered US tax dollars
funding the abuse of Palestinian kids
because that's a big story and it's true
human rights organizations are the ones
who wrote about this and that's why I'm
talking about it
we covered a story from ABC I think it
was a BC of the ROE hanga Muslims in my
am are fleeing I'm covering the how
they're starving and nobody cares and I
did commentary on that
what else did I cover oh the defeat of
Isis in Syria how series like a look
with the last town fell now they're just
scattered in the desert yay so I covered
all those every single one of those
stories perfectly newsworthy every
single one of those stories I am the
person advocating for peace I am on the
side of being a good person demonetized
every one of them and then they say they
have the nerve when I bring this up to
them to say well you know you gotta
submit it for a review but now recently
this is the new trick they're doing on
my channel at least I should probably
talk to david pakman jimmy dore humanist
reports see if they're experiencing the
same thing as me now the default thing
when i uploaded is demonetised soon as
it hits the airwaves does matter what
it's about like I did the Twitter D
verifying people story instant D
monetized
sinn I have to submit a review and
shocker look at that you need to have
over a thousand views first before they
you know they allow the review to happen
because there's a bandwidth problem too
many people are submitting it they say
well you gotta have over a thousand
views and when you submit it for reviews
I submitted the the Twitter D
verification one for review they said no
this is correct we're not gonna ver but
we're not gonna monetize this why I'm
talking about Twitter D verification how
is that what's wrong with that it
is arbitrary and I look what they need
to do is they need to have entire
channels have the ability to to say you
know what this entire channel monetize
cuz we know this isn't hateful even if
you don't agree with me and many people
don't but they were even saying on
Twitter look I don't agree with Kyle but
you should be monetize this is
crazy so and again here's my question do
you really want tech giant oligarchs to
be the ones deciding what constitutes
free speech and what doesn't what's
acceptable and what's not acceptable
mark zuckerberg my run for
president should he be controlling
should he have a say in what news his
real news or not real news if he might
run for president these these are the
same people who would have said back
during the lead up to the Iraq war
you're not allowed to say that Saddam
doesn't have weapons of mass destruction
that's wrong so maybe D monetize that
hide that call it fake news you say the
DNC was rigged well that goes against
the mainstream narrative so we're gonna
hide that too that's the same as some
 Alex Jones says about frogs
being gay or Sandy Hook being a an
inside job or conspiracy theory or
whatever don't trust the Silicon Valley
oligarchs don't believe me take the
Twitter example after Peter douche about
that you know Peter douches Peter douche
was a parody account that mocked Peter
Dow the most pathetic corporate Democrat
in existence it said in his bio
I am a parody account
his name was Peter douche not Peter down
on the site did nothing but mock
corporatists and neo liberals they
pulled him down he was like this has to
be some sort of mistake applied to get
back no it wasn't a mistake we're
pulling you down you're gonna trust
those same people
those people do it for Twitter but then
there's people who do it for Facebook
people do for you too you're gonna trust
them to determine whether or not my
video should or shouldn't be monetized
 you the whole channel should be
monetized cuz everybody knows I'm not
preaching hate you could disagree with
me ain't preaching hate and then
the final thing I want to bring up about
this is look at this this is from Kevin
journalist Kevin Rothrock okay
it says cheering Google News decision to
D rank RT and Sputnik it's part of the
company's ongoing crackdown against
offensive sites here are some other
apparent targets so Google said the
other day look we're done with our tea
and Sputnik what we're gonna do is
basically hide their stuff so even if
you do a search that's relevant where
there's an article on RT or Sputnik
about it you have nothing to do with the
Russian government or anything like that
you know we covered a story from RT
recently about I don't know what what
was it like a robotic sex doll or
something or some man in Denmark who was
arrested for having sex with a doll that
looked like a child or something like
that
that was a story from RT totally factual
you know normal story to talk about well
now they're saying all RT and Sputnik
content hide it so even if you search
for something relevant it's harder to
find it so D rank it ok well because
they say oh it's got it's fake news it's
Russian propaganda are you gonna hide
everything from CNN and MSNBC and ABC
and NBC and CBS for pushing the Iraq war
lie for literally calling torture
enhanced interrogation cuz Bush the Bush
administration said that called enhanced
arrogation we don't agree that is
torture they followed them like servile
puppy dogs are they fake news for
pushing fake news endlessly no because
by definition our mainstream outlets are
fine you know what what's not fine by
definition our alternative outlets
what's my proof look at these numbers so
oh yeah Google should prioritize stuff
well look at what fell here WSHH WSHH i
don't know who they are admittedly fell
by 67% AlterNet fell by 63% because they
say their fake news just like Alex Jones
Global Research fell by 62% Consortium
news these are all left-wing news
outlets fell by
47% Socialist Worker org fell by 47%
Media Matters which is even relatively
you know establishment II because they
do carry water for the Democratic Party
they fell by 42% common dreams fell by
37% International viewpoint 36 percent
Democracy Now fell by 36 Democracy Now
they're saying his fake news like Alex
Jones WikiLeaks fell by 30 percent truth
out fell by 25 percent counterpunch 21
percent traffic way down because Google
is de prioritizing them the intercept
fell by 19% the intercept fell by 19%
okay look man here's the bottom line
usually these outlets myself included we
I don't I hate asking for money
or support because I just want you to
enjoy this I don't want you to ever feel
like you're watching it's like guys he's
asking me to do cuz I would hate
that too of course of course but a lot
of these outlets men they're if you
support independent media if you support
support alternative media they need you
now more than ever
throw a couple bucks there their way you
know and whether it's me Jimmy Dore
humanist report david pakman Tim black
whoever you support donate to their
patreon help them out because right now
things are so unstable and they're
unstable on purpose because the powers
that be want to use so-called fake news
to hide pushes push aside and not
compete with all the outlets that are
not doing the bidding of the
establishment now listen of course
they're they're doing it to news outlets
on the right to I don't agree with the
news outlets on the right I don't think
their stuff should be hidden or
demonetized I don't agree with them but
I also think it's when they try to
pretend like we are the same as Alex
Jones you know what I mean that's
disrespectful and that's incorrect and
that's wrong and bottom line is we need
you now more than ever because if this
is I don't trust YouTube anymore at all
I don't trust them I simply don't trust
them I don't trust Twitter I don't trust
Facebook but I mostly don't
trust YouTube so understand there's
going to be absent flows in this thing
and alternative media independent media
needs your support because it feels like
an all-out onslaught on us
we have another five new Justice
Democrats for you I don't know why I'm
speaking like that so these people just
like all the other candidates that we've
introduced I think are absolutely
awesome I'm gonna give you some
specifics here some quotes about them
I'll show you some ads but this is
really exciting so first we have Breanna
Westbrook she's running in Arizona's 8th
district and she is a superstar I know
that the guys were super impressed with
Breanna so she wants to implement the
people's platform she's for automatic
voter registration she's for college for
all she's for a $15 minimum wage a wall
street tax listen to this quote from her
because you're gonna notice a theme here
and the theme is very aggressive and
populist left so she says quote we must
stop prioritizing corporate profits and
ensure health care for every American
through a single-payer system the time
is now right now the Affordable Care Act
Obamacare was a step in the right
direction in many regards but they are
an inherent flaw in Obamacare is clear
as long as those seeking to maximize
corporate profits are allowed to
determine how health care coverage works
there will always be sick people who are
forced to make some of life's most
difficult choices okay so that sounds
like me that sounds like me going on a
rant about the incentive structure
problem within our current health care
system that's exactly the point she's
making here that the cancer within the
system the virus or the disease within
our system is the for-profit private
health insurance companies and I've
often said you know how the Republicans
you screw about death panels under
Obamacare oh my god death panels death
panels they already exist the death
panels are the for-profit
insurance companies because they have an
incentive to not give out care as much
as possible not pay out on claims and
this is why medical bills is one of the
top causes of bankruptcy in the country
because how do they make more money by
denying more claims so they try to
weasel out of paying for care in any way
possible
and this is exactly what Briana
Westbrook is pointing out isn't it
refreshing to hear somebody running for
office saying something that you don't
hear many people say this is like an
open secret how broken our health care
system is and the exact dynamics of it
are almost never brought up by
politicians well now Briana's here and
she's saying no let me tell you exactly
what the problem is and this is why we
need to fix it now she's running against
representative Trent Franks
for those of you who know who that is
you just probably recoiled you're like
Oh Trent Franks because this guy is out
of his mind we've covered multiple
stories on this guy in the years that
secular talk has been around because he
often makes news for how stupid he is so
first of all he's against stem-cell
research you know not a [ __ ] n you want
to cure diseases that's sorry we can't
do that because I have in extreme
opposition to any abortion reproductive
health care at any level again stem-cell
research which is clearly anti science
voted no on the reauthorization of the
Violence Against Women Act huh
so don't get mad when when we call you
anti woman because exactly what you are
the Violence Against Women Act is a very
important piece of legislation it has a
sunset provision on it so every now and
then needs to be reaped every time all
the reasonable people vote for it Trent
Frank said no now why did the
Republicans try to stop it this time
around from being reauthorized they said
yeah you know we support the Violence
Against Women Act but it you know this
time around they added a provision that
said we also want to protect LGBTQ women
and
Native American women and we think that
goes too far what I'm not kidding
very important piece of legislation sets
up a domestic abuse hotline so when
something like that's happening oh my
god I need help you call it I mean he
voted no we voted no okay inconceivable
but that's what he did he also voted for
the Patriot Act say bye-bye to your
constitutional rights he supports a
constitutional amendment to ban gay
marriage
he's not just a standard douchebag
Republican on the issue of gay rights he
wants to go above and beyond and put it
in the Constitution that we can never
have gay marriage he voted to ban the
EPA from regulating greenhouse gases so
I don't want the EPA to do environmental
protection he voted YES on slashing
Medicare and Medicaid with the Ryan
budget he voted YES on most of the
outsourcing deals including CAFTA and
the free trade deal with Singapore for
example this guy thinks Isis is working
with Iran to nuke America so apparently
he has no clue how the Middle East works
you know he doesn't get that Iran is a
Shia isis is fundamental as sunni
they're fighting each other no they're
working together I don't know they're
Muslims so they're bad enough and
they're working together and his
probably the grossest story about him he
said on TV by the way that abortion is
worse than slavery so anyway it goes
without saying
Brianna needs to destroy this lunatic so
let's put a priority on that now the
next justice Democrat candidate this guy
has an amazing story his name's Colin
Allred he's running in the 32nd district
of Texas he played in the NFL for five
seasons what played in the NFL for five
seasons then when he was done with that
you know what he did
he went back to law school so he's in
law school I guess Danny went to the NFL
was there for five seasons said he lived
his dream got out went back to law
school and then became a civil rights
attorney what an amazing person that's
ridiculous I've never heard a story like
that before in my life and of course as
a justice Democrat taking no corporate
PAC money for Medicare for all free
college living wage you go down the list
really really impressive guy then we
have Jenny Marshall who's running in
North Carolina's fifth district and we
got a little bit of everything so I just
told you the amazing backstory of Colin
Allred well Jenny Marshall you know what
she does she's a public schoolteacher
she's a teacher and she works with labor
unions as an organizer as well so
working-class person wants to fight for
the people listen to some of her points
here she says quote ban for-profit
prison systems which lobby for laws to
arrest jail and detain in order to keep
prison beds full repeal the failed war
on drugs and eliminate mandatory
minimums which produced disparities
between the sentences of black and white
people ban fracking and eliminate the
EPA fracking loophole for oil and gas
companies and again as a justice
Democrat no corporate PAC money met for
Medicare for all free college living
wage you name it so all these candidates
are absolutely stellar and then for the
last two candidates here I'm gonna shut
the [ __ ] up and I'm gonna let you guys
take a look at what they're about in
their own words in this race I am
fighting to get corporate power out of
politics and to get representation for
this district that responds to
constituents needs instead of two big
donors and their PAC donations
I am Derrick crow I'm running for
Congress in the 21st District of Texas I
got into this race because I think
people deserve a representative that
seriously addresses the challenges that
they face in their future and in their
present
and I don't believe our current
representation does that we need people
in Congress who understand that the
influence of money in politics apart are
hurting their ability to represent their
constituents people deserve to know that
they are participating in an actual
representative democracy not an auditor
so when most people want a policy and it
doesn't violate other people's rights
then we're gonna get that policy enacted
into law hi I'm Derek crow I'm running
for Congress in the 21st District of
Texas I'm not taking any corporate PAC
money and that's why I need your support
please donate today
[Music]
i'm brent welder i'm sick and tired of
big corporations calling the shots in
washington i'm running for congress to
change it I won't accept one penny of
corporate PAC money for my campaign
because I want to work for the people of
Kansas third District not Wall Street
CEOs here in the third congressional
district voters saw through Donald Trump
but Republican congressman Kevin Yoder
continues to ignore us and keeps voting
for Trump's corporate Washington agenda
my wife Christie and I our labor lawyers
we've spent our careers fighting the
biggest readiest corporations and now
that we're parents the future of our
country has taken on a whole new
importance we met as community
organizers fighting block by block for
higher wages and health care for all I
went on to work around the country with
Barack Obama Bernie Sanders and the
first Iraq war veteran elected to
Congress last year I worked with
national democratic party leaders to
pass the most progressive platform in
history to make America work for
everyone we need fundamental change in
Washington I'll fight to raise the
minimum wage to $15 an hour because no
one who works full-time should live in
poverty all vote to wipe out corrupt tax
loopholes for giant corporations and
billionaires instead of cutting
insurance for 22 million people all work
to get every woman man and child in
America the same health care that
Congress gives themselves the big
corporations and CEOs are going to be
gunning for me in this campaign I need
your help your energy and your
enthusiasm let's show the corporations
and billionaires their millions of
dollars are no match for you that
America already is great and now we're
coming to clean up Washington once and
for all
[Music]
you know what's incredible let me make
an embarrassing admission here like I
know because I look at the polls and I
cover the stuff all the time
that there are more people out there
that agree with us than disagree with us
you know 61% of the American people want
Medicare for all
61% also want to legalize marijuana 58
percent one free college I think 60
percent want to raise taxes on the rich
only 17% as of 2013 still wanted to be
in Afghanistan that's an indication that
all these you know wars of aggression
the American people don't want him so I
know that there are more people with us
than against us but when we started the
Justice Democrats thing it's all
theoretical to a certain extent when you
look at the numbers on the page but then
when you put it out there and say okay
guys let's let's do this let's let's
have you guys become candidates and then
we're gonna fight to take over Congress
here take over the Democratic Party make
the Democratic Party you stop taking the
big money
let's have Bernie sander style
politicians elected when you say it it's
one thing when you see it in action it's
another thing and you go holy [ __ ] there
are so many people out there who would
make amazing politicians because they
actually care if they care about the
people and for us the proof is in the
pudding and it's it's in the recipe of
how we're doing this thing so when we
say no corporate PAC money and when we
say listen we don't want big donor money
we want small dollar donations from
regular people from a lot of them so
that we can stay competitive but we want
to make it so that people are guaranteed
to be beholden to the people they're
supposed to represent when we say that
you know it gives you the reassurance
and it gives you the trust ones last
time you trusted
politician but but when you bake it into
the cake that hey this is these are the
rules and then they abide by those rules
well then you actually can trust them
and what you see is that there are so
many people that are just like Bernie
Sanders who are out there who want to
make a difference who want to fight for
the right things and then if you know
it's really overwhelming when you read
about all them or when you watch their
ads like those right there and it gives
you hope and it lets you know that
there's power in numbers and we can
actually do this thing we can actually
do it but again the biggest downside is
that we are at an institutional dis
event disadvantage and that disadvantage
is in what's called the money primary
which is whoever raises the most money
is taken the most seriously can run the
most ads can get their name out there
more and they're more likely to win all
of our opponents are flush with
corporate money billionaire money and
that does give them a distinct advantage
so like all these candidates that we
have are amazing people but will we get
the word out there enough you know will
we be will we be able to make it spread
like wildfire like it should and it's
tough because you have you know not only
national media against you because they
try to not cover this as much as
possible you know but you're downplayed
and ignored like Politico and they said
Bernie Sanders style of Democrats are
giving the Hillary wing a pass what are
you talking we've done the exact
opposite from the day the election ended
but they just they run with the
narrative that you know they pretend is
the case even like local media outlets
oftentimes don't give us the coverage
that we deserve so that means it's
simply a matter of you guys it's
basically on the internet and you guys
to you know spread it through
word-of-mouth to donate time to donate
money small dollar donations to get us
into the endzone because I want to be
able to do the endzone dance when this
is all said and done and say I see I
[ __ ] told you man I
told you that we could do it so by the
way this new slate of candidates here if
you want to donate to them it's Jade M's
dot us slash for the win
Jade M's dot us slash for the win they
had a goal I think the goal was 15,000
or 17,000 or so in 24 hours which in the
context of these races you know that's
they're just getting started there but
it's the least we could do we're trying
to help them out as much as possible
they're amazing candidates and bottom
line is the revolutions here it's
happening right now so it's just a
matter of are we gonna are we gonna
follow through you know are we gonna
follow through and we're out to prove
something we're out to prove that the
the uncorrupted populace left always
beats the right and we're out to prove
that when you make the Democratic Party
what it's supposed to be all along they
can win and like I said a million times
we have more allies outside the party
than inside the party but that's okay
because we're doing a hostile takeover
the party and we understand that their
independence who are agree with us on
policy but want to stay outside the
party by all means we're still your ally
if you're in the green party if you're
in Democratic Socialist if you're
whatever however you want to try to fix
the system and get the proper policies
implemented like Medicare for all living
wage so on and so forth we're with you
but the wheels are in motion okay so now
we need you more than ever
I'll say it one more time Jay Dems dot
slash for the win these people are
amazing and it would be I mean how great
will it feel if we win these races I
want to have that feeling I want you to
have that feeling with me so let's go do
it
the New York Times has a stunning piece
of investigative reporting about a man
named Bassam Rizzo so he's from Iraq and
he lived in the US for nearly a decade
he was in Michigan and he studied
engineering at Western Michigan
University and he worked at a
telecommunications company so just like
a normal dude you know who you might be
your coworker or something in the US but
as happens with so many people his his
parents got sick and he decided well
look I feel guilty I kind of I want to
move home to take care of them and what
he did is he basically started part two
of his life she was in the u.s. for an
extended period of time
you know dated women from here lived a
100% american-style life and he goes
okay I'm gonna go back to Iraq I'm gonna
take care of my parents because they're
sick and he ended up when he was back in
Iraq ended up marrying his wife
Miata they had two kids and they bought
a place that was right across the street
from bossiness brother so his brother
and his brother's wife lived right
across the street from him their names
are Mohan odd and aza and they lived in
the countryside of Iraq perfectly lovely
place
they also have an his brother also has
an 18 year old son Najib but times got
shitty after a while because what
happened is Isis took over right by them
so Isis basically controlled their
territory I mean they were more isolated
in remote because they were in the
country but yes Isis took over the area
they were technically under Isis control
and they said they didn't know what to
do like okay I guess we have to sit and
wait it out because the ISIS wouldn't
let them leave so you have to kind of go
about life and sit and wait it out and
you know for them they were far enough
away from where Isis was centralized
that
they still lived a relatively modern
lifestyle where they would you know they
speak about how they make [ __ ] they're
not a religious family they would make
Chinese fried rice and eat that they
make pizza and they had a swimming pool
in the backyard and stuff and you know
they had some run-ins where beseems
brothers son Najib was wearing like
jeans and a shirt that had English on it
and so they they punished him they gave
him like ten lashes or something and
then you know so after that they're like
okay we're just gonna stay inside as
much as humanly possible we want to go
outside at all because of what's going
on so they basically I had to sit there
and wait it out and basically hope that
the u.s. or the coalition forces or the
Iraqi government defeats Isis and takes
their their region back but throughout
this whole period bossom he's just a
regular dude and he like for example he
would he would read he'd go online at
night and he would look at sports cars
cuz he just loves sports cars should be
looking at BMWs and all these different
cars and he'd do it till all hours in
the morning while everybody else in his
house is sleeping but so one night he
was done doing that shuts the computer
down goes upstairs it goes to sleep next
to his wife and then he wakes up in the
middle of the night cuz he heard a
really loud noise and he tasted blood
there was a giant drone strike on his
house wasn't just on his house was on
his his brother's house to everybody was
dead everybody died his family died now
one of his kids when Isis took over he
was studying in Mosul but he was able to
escape to Kurdish territory just like
right when Isis took over so one of his
kids was alive but far away so what
happens is everybody's dead his house is
destroyed boston's houses
droid he's he has no clue what happened
by the way
broken pelvis broken ribs just he almost
died - he was pulled out of the rubble
taken to the hospital they don't have
the stuff that they need to take care of
him because again the hospital is in
Isis territory so he has to apply
through an Isis bureaucracy to try to
get out to get the care he needs
they reject him his whole family just
got wiped out he needs like more surgery
he's an excruciating pain Isis is like
no we're not gonna we're not gonna
approve you to leave Isis territory well
so he then goes on Facebook he posts
about what happened what happened is a
US drone strike hit his house and his
brother's house and killed everybody and
he said I'll never forget this and his
post basically went viral in the region
so people he knew called in favors and
Isis allowed him okay we're gonna let
you go to leave territory to go to
whatever hospital I think in Turkey it
was to get treatment and so there was
this long he had to drive through Isis
territory and you know he said because
his pelvis was broken he had all these
broken bones there were times where
there's areas where they could get taken
out at any second by an RPG so the
drivers going like 100 miles an hour and
they're bumping all over the place and
he said the pain was so excruciating
that you couldn't believe it
he's got broken bones and they're going
100 miles an hour over bumpy roads I
mean you can't he just the thought of it
is it just sends chills down your spine
but so he gets out he gets to Turkey
he gets the care he needs he meets up
with his his son who wasn't there you
know the son knows what what happened
the horrendous story and this guy fought
the fight of his life
to try to clear his name and clear his
family's name and get answers from the
US government as to why they droned his
place and the New York Times uncovered
some very disturbing facts about US
drone strikes and so what they found was
now by the way this guy hit every
bureaucratic roadblock in human history
he went to like the US Embassy in Turkey
to try to get answers they said no we
can't help you here but we can send you
to this other place he went to the other
place
the guy said I'll help you then he
tapped he didn't hear back from the guy
he email them four or five times it
started not even showing up in the guy's
mailbox so he's back to square one he's
so he is he's losing his mind over this
every day he wakes up thinks about his
wife and his family that they got
murdered in cold blood and it was from a
drone strike and he wants answers
well after appealing long enough and
fighting long enough he finally learned
with the help of the New York Times that
he his property was close to property
that when the war in Iraq was at its
peak in the mid-2000s the US had set up
a base that was there that was close to
him now they abandoned that base when
there was the original drawdown in Iraq
there was a brief period where Isis had
come taken over that base but they also
weren't there for that long they moved
out of there relatively quickly so the
base was empty for years but in the
minds of the US and US intelligence they
thought oh well the base is still run by
Isis and then they did intelligence
gathering around
bassam's house and his brother's house
and they said well since we
didn't see women outside a lot we think
that's a sign that Isis is there since
every now and then we see activity where
a man will go and open a gate for a car
to drive in just opossums friends coming
over to for dinner and stuff like that
they go well that's we assumed it was
Isis so simply based on those two things
yeah we didn't see women outside so we
thought it's Isis we saw some guys open
the gate and we saw it was Isis they
thought Isis was still in control that
base and so they were living in that
house there you know what they did they
said it's a bomb factory it's an Isis
bomb fact she made it up
it's an Isis bomb factory that's what it
it's an Isis bomb factory they had a
YouTube video posted saying here's US
forces taking out an Isis bomb factory
they had it posted now over time they
pulled it down because all the comments
underneath were people from this area of
Iraq going I'll never forget what you
did to my family this is possums house
these were people were innocent you guys
murdered in cold blood
for years the u.s. denied it denied it
denied it then the New York Times
unveiled that basically what the US does
is whenever there are reports on the
ground of OU civilians were killed they
don't go by those reports because they
say oh you could be liars they try to
match up their own records of where they
bombed with credible reports to try to
say okay these are how many civilians we
took out well what did the New York
Times find out quote one in five of the
coalition strikes we identified resulted
in civilian death a rate of more than
thirty one times that acknowledged by
the coalition it is at such a distance
from official claims that this may be
the least transparent war in recent
American history while some of the
civilian deaths we documented were a
result of proximity to a legitimate Isis
target many other many others appear to
be the result simply of flawed or
outdated intelligence that conflated
civilians with calm
in in this system Iraqis are considered
guilty until proven innocent those who
survived the strikes people like Bassam
remain marked as possible Isis
sympathizers with no discernable path to
clear their names and what they would do
is they would every time bossom wrote
about this they would respond to say no
we don't even have a record of that
attack on file here because they say any
attack that occurred 30 meters or 50
meters outside of where the attack was
we didn't do that attack they say
there's no evidence of us did that
attack there's no reason the evidence
the coalition forces did that attack so
in other words it's a system of he's
guilty until proven innocent he says he
had a file with him his wife their
pictures his history his work experience
in America repeatedly brought them to
the US I'm innocent and what he wanted
was his name cleared for years they said
no I don't know we don't know you're
talking about we even do that strike I
don't know what you're talking about
well again the New York Times through
their fantastic work here they found
that there's 31 times the death rate
from drone strikes and this is in Iraq
they say in western Mosul where the
there were drone strikes that were even
heavier they even look into that they
weren't it so it's probably way more
than 31 times but they have this
basically this fake system of fake
accountability in the US where they
pretend we're talking about with that
airstrike I don't know what you mean so
he was looking for an explanation the
explanation was insufficient then they
say okay maybe since it became too
obvious and now reporters are on
Boston's case ok the governor the the
government has to try to make it right
the military has to try to make it right
so what do they do they call bossom in
and they say ok you know we're we feel
horrible about this we're gonna offer a
monetary reward so bossom is thinking
okay well let's see the to each house
I mean their $500,000 for the house then
how much do you put on to the value of
each life that was lost so five hundred
five hundred thousand for the houses how
much does my are are my kids worth how
much is my wife worth he's like there's
no number that makes this okay but
nonetheless they give him an offer they
say we'll give you $15,000
he said I'm not I can't accept that this
is insulting and he left and to this day
you know now his story is a sad story
a template of what happens in situations
where there's us drone strikes where
they kill civilians this is this is the
system this is how it looks he's guilty
until proven innocent he repeatedly
proves that he's innocent they deny it
for years finally they say okay I guess
we'll offer you a reward they offer him
$15,000 by the way that's even above
what the legal limit is as of right now
the legal limits 2,300 dollars for one
of these situations well between this
story in Iraq and the drone memo
remember the internal drone memos that
were released where they found that 90%
of drone strikes get the wrong target
between those two things hey maybe it's
time to do away with these drone strikes
because there there's ample evidence
that they don't help they make things
worse you're killing way more civilians
there's no justice you get the wrong
people than even when the people have
overwhelming evidence proof that they
didn't do it you denied as long as
possible so I think it's time to move
past these drone strikes because they're
doing more harm than good
they're simply doing more harm than good
and Noam Chomsky calls it the world's
biggest terrorist program because again
there's no accountability we have
coverage stories of people who are
former drone operators who came clean
who said look the whole culture is
beyond rotten you have people who are
drunk when they operate the drones who
are high on cocaine when they operate
the drones they talk about it like it's
not real human beings they talk about
how hey we're cutting the grass we're
killing fun-sized terrorists that's a
direct quote from one of these people
who was a former drone operator he says
other operators have spoken about this
yeah were fun-sized terrorists little
little terror is little kids that's what
they call them fun sigh they don't be
terrorists eventually anyway just kill
them is this what we want to do is this
how we want to be as a country the
problem is that as we mascar civilians
we have the nerve to even tell ourselves
these pretty little lies we need to face
reality there needs to be justice and we
need to stop with this because it's not
working and it's ruining lives just ask
Bassam Rizzo
hello everybody what's up um
me and corin almost uh well it wasn't it
wasn't really corn it was it was me uh
my skype was not acting right
and um it was being a pain in the ass my
[ __ ] is never act all right
yeah um so i think it like automatically
updated which is a little weird like
wouldn't do you expect them to like ask
you or some [ __ ]
yeah there's probably a point of no
return where i've gotten so many
messages on my laptops it's just like do
you want to update do you want to update
install this install this that after
like 40 [ __ ] times saying no it's
probably just like [ __ ] you [ __ ] you
we're doing this [ __ ] with or without
you so that's what happened i logged on
and my skype like didn't work at first
and then i restarted the computer and
clicked the skype and it looked like it
updated and i was like what the [ __ ] is
this but i nearly had a heart attack
because the call recorder that we that
we use for this didn't pop up usually i
set it so that whenever i log into skype
that automatically pops up that call
recorder and when it updated it didn't
pop up and i was like oh [ __ ] but
knowing me i don't know how to fix that
[ __ ] so what's the first thing i do i'ma
restart it so restarted it came back on
it wasn't working i was like oh no and i
was like all right just restarted it one
more time
i restarted i restarted it again and
then it didn't work but then i called i
was like let me call him anyway and see
if anything happened so i called you and
then boom it popped up with the call
recorder thing and it was like it was
like have to update yada yada and i was
like okay so now i gotta update this
[ __ ] too
clicked on the update for that the
update for that was over in like 30
seconds it was just like boom boom done
that's the best one [ __ ] just works it
did hit me with a password though oh and
i was like no
but then i got it on the second one and
it was i was like thank god i got on the
second one but then updated and now now
it's working seemingly working like it's
supposed to it's a good feeling when
when [ __ ] just updates like when you
push update and it just does what it's
supposed to do yeah and then maybe it
hits you with one like hey
you want to restart your computer like
you're like can i do it in an hour or
two yeah i actually hate that one
because i always feel like
like [ __ ] you don't know what
i'm in the middle of right now like
that's why sometimes it blesses you it's
like you want to do it later tonight oh
okay you're right with the yeah it gives
you the option yeah sometimes i need you
with the automatic and you're like
[Music]
that one's bad yeah i feel like pcs are
worse than with that than mac max is
like nice to you
yeah it's not now
but pcs are like you're just boom starts
doing it i've had updates
on a computer
that i needed for the show
that had mad clips on it that i was
going to do for the show and it they can
it starts updating like five minutes
before the show
and i'm like [ __ ]
so you were like when this is done it's
gonna reset like you were nervous that
this [ __ ] get lost so like i go to turn
on the computer that has all the clips
for the show that day needing it for the
live show
and then when i go to turn the computer
on it's doing updates oh it's going slow
and i got five minutes until i'm on air
and i'm like [ __ ]
that's happened before you know what
pisses me off
when you're working on mad [ __ ] and then
you'll get like an error message or not
responding and your computer will freeze
and then your laptop will hit you with
like a do you want to report this to
like mac or windows yeah and it like is
that about like do you think there's
like you can actually rep like because i
think one time i might have hit like
yeah [ __ ] it i'm gonna report this [ __ ]
then didn't do [ __ ] does it didn't do
anything yeah i get i i think i clicked
that once too and nothing happened it's
like if your internet frozen is all
[ __ ] up how is it going to report
your error message if you're if you have
no internet yeah
yeah
like who the [ __ ] are you reporting it
to anyway it's not like there's some
dude sitting you know
in like india who's like how can i help
you
that doesn't happen
you heard about facebook's um new policy
thing they were trying to do no no what
happened
so supposedly you can
upload your
like selfies and your nudes to facebook
oh i did hear about that oh my god that
was so funny
they're like
what for everything else there's [ __ ]
algorithms that like they're like oh we
use algorithms to figure [ __ ] out
because algorithm algorithms is the only
way to deal with like so much of this
stuff because we got so many people on
facebook and then for nudes they're like
we can we can look at that if you want
like what happened to algorithms dude i
thought you were into algorithms what
happened
they're like they'll put a water stamp
on it or something like that to make
sure that no one can upload it again
yeah but they just need a creepy ass
dude named ted sitting in [ __ ]
washington state beating off to look at
your pictures first
you're like oh my news will be safer if
i show them to ted only oh man i don't
know how they thought of that and
someone was like
that'll work that's a good idea
that'll work you can market that well
people really like that and then did you
see the amazon thing the amazon thing
was
uh it's a new uh service where they drop
your package off inside the house for
you
i
my mind just went very dirty when you
said they dropped your package off
well they let they okay so they
will open your door they have a key for
your place open your door and put the
package inside
so in other words you're giving amazon
access to your [ __ ] house
i'm
i don't know in a weird way i'm sort of
okay with that oh no [ __ ] that man in a
weird way a giant multinational
corporation access to your house so they
can just go in there
i feel like you have to trust every
[ __ ] delivery thing associated with
them is totally legit
that's true
but i feel like if they somehow
like signed up to be a delivery driver
and has all all their background
information
now now i'm second guessing
because they could text their boy and
just be like yo i got the key to this
person's house even if even if they do
it like with the drones or some [ __ ] i
don't want some weird ass machine
logging data about my place into the
it's just not no just no
and the onion was mocking this and they
did an article
um and the title was popular new uh
amazon
um feature comes to your house and just
kills you
[Laughter]
it's true
yeah they get away with whatever they
want yo man i gotta bring it up right up
front no more [ __ ] around louisike
you gotta tell me what you think about
all this
because for everybody who doesn't know
coryn is the biggest louis c.k fan i
mean i love louis c.k but you you were
the number you were talking about him
before anybody was talking about him and
you went you saw him how many times you
see him live once twice so he came to
um the college i went to suny cortland
back when i was
i think so i transferred there so i was
a junior so my junior year he came there
um before he was even bigger that was
sort of before he blew up or like right
around like yeah lucky louie or some
[ __ ] on hbo
which i hadn't even watched but i just
heard i was like oh [ __ ] it's something
to do i think it was a friday night or
something like that um
and uh
he was like making jokes like he made a
joke about like hitler and like the
holocaust and all this stuff and i was
like all right he's he's like taking
he's on chances yeah yeah yeah but he
was he was like funny and then i started
following a little bit more um
i i saw him at radio city music hall
he was funny um
i've i've watched like
looking back on it
he's a funny dude because he he like he
just thinks differently you know he put
like
he would think outside the box and put
himself in situation like he'd be in a
regular situation but think about it
differently well i always found that
whenever he was talking about a topic it
would be like
i i would go oh that's that's ob that
you're right like you that's a good
point and it made me laugh like i always
feel like he would say something and it
would just clarify something for me and
i'm like yeah that's true that's true he
has a lot of jokes like that
but it's very easy to see looking back
now like
all the topics he spoke about stuff
stuff like some of the stuff that you
cringed on like when he spoke on
you'd be like ooh
why would he go there you know and now
it's like okay like what for example i'm
curious gave you the cringe
i mean
like one of his biggest jokes was like
bag of dicks you know like suck on a bag
of dicks or something like that which is
like funny yeah it was funny
um
he did a lot of like
like masturbation jokes you know he'd
take the microphone and like turn it
over or whatever like that and like but
so you're saying you think that was like
subconscious like him kind of almost
like letting his kinks seep out while
he's on stage that he's got the these
kinds of weird sexual issues or no yeah
i think so and and now they have people
like
the name of his new movie was like i
love you daddy it's just like you know
like i don't know apparently that's
about like
his daughters or whatever the rumors i
thought were always dressed in there or
something
yeah i don't know man he's it like
like you look back on these things and
even his tv show louis you know i would
watch it and
like when i first watched it jerking off
when you turned it on
he's on screen just beating off
i would watch it and i thought to myself
like this show is weird like you know
like it's it's strange and it's dark and
yeah i never watched his cartoon and i
never watched his tv show
on fx i never yeah never watched it all
i know all i've seen of him that i
really like is his stand-up
and i've i've seen almost all of his
stand-ups like his big ones and i liked
him all right yeah i've never seen his
other stuff
yeah so his other stuff is different
distinctly different you're saying it's
not like his stand up because yeah but
it's weird because that you you listen
to people and you read stories
and people critiquing the show and stuff
and they're like that's you know it's
it's he's on a different level it's very
the show's great it's brilliant and
you watch it and you're like
it's it's just weird you know and like
now looking at it it's like
that was weird okay and like
when you thought back like that it was
weird you'd have other other people
experts telling you like no he's a
genius and he just thinks differently
and you're like no it's weird well yeah
when someone it's funny how when
somebody blows up that does happen like
somebody will blow up and you know all
of a sudden everything they do is
categorized as like genius right yeah oh
my god you're so amazing it's like well
no that i don't think that thing was
amazing particularly but overall you
know again i only know his standups
that's my limited kind of experience
with louis c.k but i always thought he
was brilliant and kind of an outside of
the box thinker
um
but yeah the uh
you i'm it's interesting that you think
the like his uh his jokes
in some way like kind of let his kink
slip out where he because he did talk a
lot about weird stuff from time to time
um
[Music]
but yeah so when i first read i did you
read the article or no did you have the
general idea yeah i read it okay so
like
to me the art the article seemed pretty
clear that like or at least it heavily
implied
that he would at it like he asked these
girls if he could beat off and then he
just started beating off like he didn't
wait for a response
um
so it's i actually saw some people
defending him and their
basically their defenses
i think assumed that the women had said
yes
but i don't know why where they're
getting that from because the article
seemed to me to indicate that they were
definitely like no but then another
point that people make is the power
dynamic when he was doing it when he
worked on the chris rock show or
something
and like there was somebody who was a
staffer who was working like underneath
him
who he asked if he could beat off in
front of him and then he was working on
this other thing where patricia arquette
and david arquette were like the
directors or producers or some [ __ ] or
creators of something
and
he has somebody who worked underneath
him and then they that person was like
no and then went to patricia arquette
and david arquette and told them and so
you know when people asked them like hey
is did
did is this true what like the rumors
and they're like yeah he did like ask
some
random person who was working under him
if he could beat off in front of him but
it's weird the different um
like and then there's one where he just
did it on the phone yeah like he was
like lowering the shades they said yeah
the phone one is i think super unethical
but that's not illegal though the one
where he did it where he's doing it to
the he's asking and it's somebody who
works underneath him you can't do that
but that again is not illegal the one
where he just asked and then they didn't
say yeah and he started doing it isn't
that like borderline illegal if that's
exactly how it unfolded because they
were apparently two comics right they
worked with that were working with him
at some fast like colorado or something
or whatever and the bar was closed but
they wanted to drink and louis made it
seem like casually like hey
you know come on hey we'll just have
some drinks in my room and he invited
both of them and they said that they got
the vibe of like it's professional thing
and it's just we're gonna go have some
drinks and there's two of them and one
of him and then he just asks like
but i don't get i mean like i would
never question someone you know making
the allegations i
highly believe it happened
but even if like me
if i'm in the room with like someone i
idolize like if i'm in the room with
i don't know
kobe bryant yeah like yeah like kristaps
porzingis or kobe bryant and like
he's like
yeah you want to come up to my room
after after the game man and just chill
be like [ __ ] yeah man you got like
whatever we'll play video games and he's
like yo you mind if i jerk off in front
of you i'd be like
what the [ __ ] like i don't care if he's
kobe bryant i don't care if he's the
[ __ ] pope or like what
you just
i'd leave the room or like i'd be like
this guy is sick yeah i would too the
only cat the only point i've heard to
counter that is basically people saying
like number one you they literally could
have been in shock when it was happening
so you don't know what to do but then
also the second thing is when it's when
he's your colleague and he's more
powerful than you
it and he
knows more people in their social circle
it's almost like you're afraid of
retribution or revenge and what he can
do if you don't just kind of grit your
teeth and bear the awkwardness of that
moment
but if you but if you but i know i agree
with you i would leave too like it's not
a question if somebody starts beating
off
but even that argument like
the [ __ ]
two stories would just outweigh each
other they'd be like all right louis ck
you tell your story and it's like they
came back to my room and they were just
being weird and they were asking me to
beat off and then it's like all right
you tell your story and it's like he
pulled out his dick and asked us to
start master you'd be like you seem like
you're telling the truth yeah i don't
you know that's the other thing about
this is
what a weird [ __ ] kink man and that's
that i spoke about that when the when it
first leaked i did a sep you know
separate video just talking about it on
uh my channel and
you know it it took me this long i'm
[ __ ] 29 years old it took me this
long until i realized that oh hold on
i get it apparently there are some
people who exist
that
apparently the whole thing that gets
louis ck off
is when it looks like somebody's
uncomfortable and not a willing
participant like that's what gets him
hard is like when somebody
is looking like whoa what's going on
here i'm not happy with this i'm not
comfortable with this like that whole
vibe is the thing that makes him horny
which is a creepy [ __ ] thought yeah
you know
which in a way you describing that right
now is almost like
his comedy in a sense that awkwardness
and that weirdness was getting him off
in a way you know
ah Louie Louie what have you done son
what have you done
the reason I'm recording for you guys
from 2006 as a YouTube commentator once
said hilariously is because there's no
show until Monday and I didn't want to
wait until Monday to discuss this I'm
also gonna get into the the Roy Moore
stuff not in this video I'll do a
separate video for that but don't worry
I haven't missed that story there's a
lot a lot of sexual assault stories that
leak on the same day it was kind of
strange but I want to I want to talk
about this louis c.k thing for a second
so louis c.k there have been rumors
about louis c.k for a while apparently
you know in hollywood and comedy circles
it's been like an open secret for a
while that he's got you know some creepy
stuff going on and now the there was a
story in The New York Times that came
out that was basically um you know
giving details and putting faces to the
accusations so people you know finally
came out and spoke about exactly what
the deal is so I'm not gonna get into
the details if you guys want you can go
read the The New York Times article
about this at least as of right now
there's I think five different women who
are accusing him of and I don't even
know the right word for sexual
misconduct the sexual assault but just
to give you the Cliff Notes version of
it cuz again we don't need to get into
the specifics apparently his thing
allegedly is he would jerk off in front
of people unwilling participants you
know I think one case it was like he
called somebody into a room for a
meeting when he was a writer on a
different show and he started jerking
off another one is
almost like a Weinstein esque move where
you invite people for you know what they
think is like a business get together
whether it's at I don't know if he did
the Weinstein thing where Weinstein said
oh come to the restaurant and then like
when they show up the people at the
front desk are like oh no he actually
he's up in his hotel room and he wants
you to meet him there I don't know if
Louie CK did that but he met with two
women in his hotel room and apparently
he was like do you guys mind if I like
taking my penis and they're like what
and then he just took it out and started
started jerking off um I don't know I
mean it's a gross conversation because I
don't know how honestly the mechanics of
it work like what does he do we he would
take it out in jerk off and whatnot in
like 20 seconds 30 seconds and then the
women are like what just happened like I
didn't agree to this I'm not okay with
this but yeah apparently that's his
thing his thing is like getting women
alone and according to them there are
unwilling participants and he would just
jerk off in front of them another one
was a phone call he made to somebody who
I think he knew the person's boyfriend
or husband or whatever and it was like a
business call but she heard him like
breathing heavy and then he started
talking about like his sexual fantasies
and he would be jerking off on the other
end of the line and she was like I had
no idea what to do so you know it took
me all this time I'm [ __ ] 29 years
old and like it just hit me the other
day and that's sad because it shows how
slow I am but like now I understand that
like apparently there's a large segment
not a large segment I don't know the
number I have no idea what the number is
but there's a certain percentage of the
population that their whole thing is
that they get off when people are
unwilling participants you know what I
mean like that's louis ck's compulsion
is i want to see that the other person
is uncomfortable and seemingly not
wanting to partake in what's going down
and that's like that's a real it's sad
that's really sad that's really really
sad because how does that happen you
know is it one of those things that I
don't know you're born with and you just
have this thing where the only way you
get your rocks off as if somebody is
seemingly uncomfortable or not partaking
in the the sex act in question or is it
something that you you know you pick up
at some point somehow in your formative
years as a child you have some
experience that leads you to believe
that I don't know people who don't want
to partake or somehow sexy or more
attractive to you I don't know what it
is but that like so it strikes me in the
case of louis c.k it's a compulsion
thing of course assuming all the
allegations are true now in the case I
like Weinstein that strikes me as almost
like like a power dynamic where it's
exploitative and manipulative and
coercive on purpose like they built it
into some of Weinstein's contracts where
you know they described how I think
they're right well I think I'll Riley
had this in his contract to that like
for a certain number of allegations
there's a certain amount of payoff you
know like if they accuse you of X you
pay out X amount if they accuse you of
why you pay out this amount so it's
almost like for a guy like Weinstein it
was like his whole thing was well look
if you want to play ball in Hollywood
here's the way it works it's almost like
he had like a menu that was like if you
jerk me off you got a c-list role if you
give me the head you get a b-list role
if you go all the way you get an a-list
role and a good point that somebody made
was you're only seeing the people who
rejected him and were offended by that
you know what I mean and we've all heard
the audio and that was a monstrous audio
where he's like trying to basically
almost drag the woman into his hotel
room Weinstein's thing was like oh let
meet me in the restaurant we'll talk
about your career and then when the
people got there the the people at hotel
would say no he's actually in his room
we want you to meet him in his room he
waiting in a [ __ ] bathrobe
you know and he would you know that in
the audio we heard there's
one poor woman who is basically trying
to like drag in and it struck it's a
power dynamic with them where it's like
they're trying to exploit these young
actresses who want to make it and
they're they're using sex they're saying
look if you [ __ ] me you're gonna make it
far basically and you know that there's
a power problem they're like I don't
know what counts as um a bad pick up
versus unethical but not illegal versus
totally illegal you know what I mean
like there's a [ __ ] weird-ass gray
area and even in the case of like Bill
Cosby so I don't I think he's guilty and
I think that because how there's like a
thousand accusers of him and I think
many of them you know were literally
like he just drugged them and raped them
when they were [ __ ] unconscious and
they had no idea that's like rape 101 is
math serial rape but then people other
people muddy the waters cuz there are
people that like had relationships with
him who said oh yeah he he did this to
me like 37 times it's like wait what so
you went out with him once and then he
did this to you and then like you went
out with him again on Tuesday like no if
you stop don't if somebody does that you
you don't go see them again obviously
and in the case of Weinstein again
you're hearing about the ones who didn't
want any of it
how many of them were totally playing
ball the whole time so with Weinstein it
struck me as a power play um with louis
c.k it strikes me as more of a
compulsion than a power play where it's
almost like he knows a lot of his comedy
you see it come out where okay that's
not the right phrasing for this
conversation and a lot of his comedy you
see almost like he's kind of slyly
cleverly in the subtext admitting to all
of how flawed he thinks he is and how
bad he thinks he is and almost like he
knows how terribly wrong this is and
that's the thing is like I think he's
smart enough to realize that this
all terrible but he did it anyway so if
that's the case then the only thing I
could take away from that is it's a
[ __ ] compulsion and that doesn't mean
there shouldn't be any you know
punishment or justice for it of course
there should be but it's a stark and sad
realization when you think like oh there
are people who are otherwise totally
normal and in some way is you know a
superstar he is he's extraordinary in a
way but he had this dark side to him
where you know he was perfect he
apparently couldn't stop jerking off in
front of people who didn't want it so
it's man all these this [ __ ] tidal
wave of sex assault and I was talking to
my friend about it and he's he's
admittedly from like a different
political perspective and outlook on the
world than me and what's funny is his
his take on it is so different it's
almost like he there's so much of this
stuff coming out that his take away is
like it feels super witch-hunt II in his
opinion I don't really agree with him
because like again so the example I just
gave sure I think there are many
instances of like even with Bill
O'Reilly I'm sure some of the people who
are claiming oh he whatever assaulted me
or something sexually assaulted me I'm
sure some of them were like they were in
a consensual relationship with him
now they regret it and now they're
piling onto the list of people who he
actually assaulted kind of thing you
know what I mean so I think that there
are some instances of people muddying
the waters and you know they may have
they may not be okay now with what at
the time was a consensual relationship
and they're kind of piling on and almost
D legitimizing the the real criticisms
and the real accusations against them I
think that exists but I you know I
honestly believe quite different from my
friend who I was talking to about this
that yeah it does look like there's a
kind of a systemic problem
how in the case of guys like Weinstein
and O'Reilly it's using your power to
manipulate and exploit and coerce and
it's almost like pay to play for your
career if you get me off then you get
this far and you know is that something
that's just unethical but not illegal or
is that something that's totally illegal
and how do we address it and in the case
of you know louis c.k here this strikes
me less as a power thing but more of a
compulsion thing but it really it makes
me sad that that's a thing that exists
you know it's a thing that exists the
dudes like it's a dark way to think of
it but like think of you listening right
now whatever you're into sexually I you
know I don't know I I know that [ __ ]
85% of my audiences is males so what
what are you a urine - I don't know
women who are brunettes who have big
tits or whatever I don't know but like
that's the thing that gets you going
it's a scary thought to think that
there's people out there and Louie CK my
PA an example of this of like the whole
thing that gets him going is when a
woman's like no I don't want to
participate and I'm super uncomfortable
and I'm an unwilling participant in this
and then they have the face of like what
are you doing and that's the thing that
gets him hard and gets him off hold man
is that scary thought but yeah I hope
you know I don't I don't even know how
would you bring justice in these
circumstances but I hope all the women
who were who were wrong - were sexually
assaulted I hope there's justice and I
think that many of the accusations
against guys like Cosby and O'Reilly and
and Weinstein are true I don't think all
of them are true but I think that a lot
of them in each case are true
unfortunately the situation with louis
c.k they as well they also could be true
but man it's such a wall it's such a
landslide a tsunami a [ __ ] waterfall
of accusations all at once and it's
almost like we're lifting the veil
this institutional problem because back
in the day I don't want to drag on and
on about this which I'm already doing
but back in the day like you get the
sense that in like seriously like in
1950 1960 like this is everybody was
Weinstein in these situations everybody
and that's a terrible thought
it's a terrible thought that like if
you're a woman in Hollywood the idea was
no the only way you make it is to suck
off fat old ugly men like that's the
only way you can make it it's like what
so there's no it's not at all in temp to
try to be a meritocracy on this front
and you know that's one of the things
Weinstein said by the way and if that
doesn't at all excuse it because it
appears that he genuinely sexually
harassed or assaulted a lot of these
women but one of the things he said was
like oh yeah you know this something
about like I think's have changed over
the years or something to that effect in
other words yeah like in nineteen fifty
every single [ __ ] was doing this
like that's the whole game was okay you
know do sex acts with me and then I'll
try to advance your career
um yes something feels super-wrong about
that like gatekeepers who are old
wealthy powerful men who are like well
this is the way you climb the ladder so
in other words it doesn't matter you
could be the best actress ever but if
you're not gonna play ball in that
respect then with many of these guys you
don't get anywhere back in the day it
was probably almost a hundred percent
today I don't know how high the
percentage is but if you know all these
accusations are true then perhaps it's
more than somebody who's a naive like me
thought it was so and by the way yes I
know there's because there's gonna be a
crowd who screams like innocent until
proven guilty innocent until proven
guilty innocent until proven guilty yes
I know that I [ __ ] know that I know
that I know that that's the way the
justice system works and that's the way
it should work I get it everybody
[ __ ] gets it but that doesn't mean
that we're not allowed to have
conversations about the underlying
issues that doesn't mean that we're not
you know we're not allowed to talk about
these things without adding three
hundred and fourteen hedges and caveats
you know well allegedly allegedly
allegedly we all get it that's [ __ ]
grandfathered into the conversation here
but yeah it's sad because Louie CK I
think is a super talent
comedian but you know he had this dark
side has this dark side he hasn't
responded yet at least as of the point
of me making this video but we'll see if
he does so you know in summation I I
don't know I do think there's a real
problem here in the case of like the
Weinsteins and the O'Reilly it was
almost like they tried to bake it into
the way Fox News function they tried to
with Roger Ailes we know that's the case
they tried to bake it into the way
Hollywood functions and their movies
function where it's almost like well
that's the way it works you have to do X
Y Z to get a job and in the case of
Louie CK it just struck me as more of a
like a really sad compulsion that he
knows is wrong but he perhaps you know
exercised anyway so don't worry we'll
get to the Roy Moore thing next because
they're Roy Moore the Roy Moore thing is
there's another layer to the Roy Moore
thing and it's the hypocrisy and I think
that's the thing that pisses me off more
than anything you know like louis c.k if
all this stuff is true what he did is
horrendous but there was a lot of like
hints that he knew it was wrong but he
was doing it which makes it like
terrible compulsion with Roy Moore I
mean he'd go whew thousand miles an hour
down the [ __ ] hypocrisy slide so we'll
talk about that in a little bit but
louis c.k in the words of somebody who's
very powerful at the moment said boom
everybody right as I was about to upload
the segment on louis c.k we get this he
just released a statement he says I want
to address the stories told to the New
York Times by five women named Abby
Rebecca
Dana Julia who felt able to name
themselves and one who did not these
stories are true at the time I said to
myself that what I did was okay because
I never showed a woman my dick without
asking first which is also true what I
learned later in life too late is that
when you have power over another person
asking them to look at your dick isn't a
question it's a predicament for them the
power I had over these women is
they admired me and I wielded that power
irresponsibly I have been remorseful of
my actions and I've tried to learn from
them and run from them now I'm aware of
the extent of the impact of my actions I
learned yesterday the extent to which I
left these women who admired me feeling
badly about themselves and cautious
around other men who would never have
put them in that position
I also took advantage of the fact that I
was widely admired in my and their
community which disabled them from
sharing their story and brought hardship
to them when they tried because people
who look up to me didn't want to hear it
I didn't think that I was doing any of
that because my position allowed me not
to think about it there is nothing about
this that I forgive myself for and I
have to reconcile it with Who I am which
is nothing compared to the task I left
them with I wish I had reacted to their
admiration of me by being a good example
to them as a man and given them some
guidance as a comedian including because
I admired their work the hardest regret
to live with is what you've done to hurt
someone else but I can hardly wrap my
head around the scope of hurt I brought
on them I'd be remiss to exclude the
hurt that I've brought on people who I
work with and have worked with whose
professional and personal lives have
been impacted by all of this including
projects currently in production the
cast and crew of better things baskets
the cops one Mississippi and I love you
daddy I deeply regret that this has
brought negative attention to my manager
Dave Becky who only tried to mediate a
situation that I caused I brought
anguish and hardship to the people at FX
who have given me so much the orchard so
much the orchard who took a chance on my
movie and every other entity that has
bet on me through the years I brought
pain to my family my friends my children
and their mother I have spent my long
and lucky career talking and saying
anything I want I will now step back and
take a long time to listen so you know
I'm sure people will pick this apart a
million ways and have you know many bone
to pick with it but I think it's a good
statement but then again I'm very biased
because I like louis c.k before all this
came out and you know I mean obviously
if you can't bring this up or ask
anybody involved because it just seems
like next-level impolite but he says he
asked all of them if it's if he could
show them his dick and then you know the
story makes it seem like they they said
no and then he took it out anyway or
they didn't say anything and it was like
super awkward and then he took it out
anyway you know I think a lot hinges on
what their reaction was if he asks and
they say yes and then he does that's a
totally different story than if he asks
and they say no and he does or if he he
asks and they say nothing and they're
just uncomfortable and he does you know
like each one of those situations is
very very different in my opinion but I
think I think his point about the power
dynamic is true and I think that's one
that you know a lot of people overlook
or kind of brush aside but yeah you know
hello everybody welcome to the jungle
whoo welcome to the jungle wait I was
just [ __ ] um thinking like I don't
know how I'll be able to tell if I had
an irregular heartbeat
mm-hm yeah thank you know people like
like a doctor will be like or someone
was diagnosed with an irregular
heartbeat yeah I wouldn't know how to
tell ya cuz you get the palpitations
like I do I get those too well you just
sayin you sit there and be like yeah
yeah I get that too but then half the
time I think oh that's definitely my
heart I'm gonna die in like three
minutes and then the other half the time
I think I like stop and think about I'm
like no maybe that's like my chest
muscle that's like above my heart that's
like fighting off yeah like twitching
basically so could be that it could be
that there's one time I went to the
emergency room cuz I thought I was
having a heart attack did you know I
don't know I feel like it's a story I
should have already told on the podcast
but I guess I didn't yeah I was young
when I was probably how old was I I
guess I was in middle school but it may
have been like ninth grade or something
and I was sitting at home I was eating I
was only one home I think was in the
summer and everybody was out doing
something and I was eating a ham
sandwich in my living room and I felt
like I was having a heart attack I felt
like a sharp pain like right where
heart--it you would feel a heart attack
and I sat there for like three minutes
four minutes I'm like no I can't be I'm
[ __ ] I'm like young this is stupid
there's no way this is a heart attack
don't be stupid Kyle and then i sat
there waited waited waited and then
after like five minutes I was like
that's it I'm having a heart attack I
gotta go because I felt like I was
having a heart attack it was bad like
the pain was horrendous and so the pain
was in your heart cuz I've heard from
people that through our text they feel
that Shin they're armed I think it was
my my like I don't know if it was like
my right
armed in my right chest I've got read
that it was like you feel it on the
opposite side if I don't know if it was
before I had read that you would feel on
the opposite side maybe it was my left
PEC and my left arm but it was like a
sharp pain and I was like oh [ __ ] like
like if you had asked me to just imagine
in my head what a heart attack feels
like I would have imagined exactly what
I felt on that day and so I called my
mom she was at work she didn't were you
in like prime time eating like [ __ ] mode
like what did you first think like I
mean like [ __ ] or had a good diet like
yeah and start dieting good even half
the time until I was like 21 or some
[ __ ] but but I didn't think about that I
just thought like maybe I'm just having
a heart attack like I didn't think about
why or any of that [ __ ] though just like
I'm I think I'm gonna have a heart
attack so I call my mom she didn't
answer she was at work she didn't see
the phone ring or whatever I called her
like two times my sister wasn't around I
don't remember where she was call my dad
my dad didn't answer I'm sitting there
like I'm gonna die and it's gonna be
their fault and there wasn't have missed
calls on their phone yeah but so then I
decided oh I know what I'll do I called
my friend's mom who wasn't working
mm-hmm and so she would be like home I
would always be over my friends house
and she answered and I told her what was
going on she's like why and so she
rushed over picked me up took me to the
emergency room when I got to the
emergency room they give you like a form
they're like fill it out and tell us how
bad your pain is or some [ __ ] it was
like scale of 1 to 10 I put nine like
I'm having a heart attack I wrote on
this [ __ ] thing so anyway they bring
me in I don't remember if they gave me
an IV or not of like [ __ ] morphine or
some [ __ ] I don't remember but they did
do the EKG heart thing or whatever like
they put me on some meter and just
recorded the results and then after like
I don't know maybe I was there for maybe
two or three hours um yeah after maybe
two
for three hours ice I had started
feeling better and then they released me
and I think what it was and people are
gonna laugh but this is apparently this
is not uncommon like maybe it's it's
probably uncommon that people actually
take the step of going the hospital for
it but I think it was like either like
really bad heartburn or just like gas
that was there it was like you know
affecting me where I felt like a heart
attack and apparently what happens with
a lot of young people they'll go to the
hospital there with at least some young
people to go to the hospital thinking
they're having a heart attack
and it turns out being that that's
exactly what happened to me but then
with a lot of old people they will be
having a heart attack and they'll think
it's just heartburn or gas and they
don't go and then they die that's no
good yes it's better to just go if
you're feeling that [ __ ] yeah so I was
yeah that was a weird day man there have
been some points where I'm in like
[ __ ] really bad pain but I don't
think to the threshold everywhere I'm
like I got a I got a like go to the
hospital or dial now and one or some
[ __ ] like there's been times the middle
of the night it's only been like stomach
pains yeah it's not no it's because I've
eaten some [ __ ] like if I was just
eating healthy and all of a sudden I
like in the middle of the night I was
like my stomach was killing I big
something's off
yeah if I know I [ __ ] myself up with
some crazy-ass meal yeah I'm like now
you can't call nobody [ __ ] this
is all on you yeah and stomachs like the
one thing where I think everybody just
deals with it it doesn't matter who you
are everybody's like it's just stomach
[ __ ] it'll pass but like it is bad when
you're going through it you got a wrong
it is [ __ ] your brains out or you're
throwing up or whatever
not even that like like shootings one
thing but then there's a point where
I'll be laying on my bathroom floor in
like a sweat yep like just a cold sweat
yeah where I'm like I don't even care
right now if I just [ __ ] all over my
floor I'm still been there I've been in
that position where you're like I don't
I literally don't care yeah yeah I've
been I've been there I'm like I want to
cut open my stomach and just [ __ ]
take out whatever is [ __ ] me up right
now yeah this I mean medicine is so big
like there are places that don't have
any pain pills and like you know if you
go to like rural third-world countries
and you go to rural areas and
third-world countries and like people
will have like [ __ ] stage 4 cancer
and no way to take the edge off and just
be sitting there like reeling in pain
for hours and hours and hours in every
waking moment it's just horrendous and
I'm like you know I'm feel like I have a
very low threshold for pain
yeah I'm one of those people where like
I become a whiny [ __ ] real quick like
if something's bothering me a little bit
physically like I really quick I feel
like I'd rather die than feel this
[ __ ] pain which admit always it's
amazing to me that there are some people
who aren't like that like there are
people with high threshold for pain I'm
like how do you have that because I know
how quickly it takes me to just like and
by the way I try to think but like if
you break your leg or some [ __ ] you I
mean I'd be in pain but I try to think
that I'd be like cuz I've rolled my
ankle bad before and I tried it like I'm
like now I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm
good I'll walk this off I've broken
bones before and it's the worst thing
ever but do you turn it it's not like
you turn it to like you don't turn it to
a little punk you're just like cry I cry
I mean granted when I broke when I when
I broke bones I was young I was like a
kid but yeah I cried I cried and I cried
and I cried and then I said that
stitches a bunch of times and I cried
for that yeah it's almost impressive
like when cuz I watched Gordon Hayward
[ __ ]
I watched Paul George when he broke is
like they're [ __ ] tough because they
didn't cry they almost like I guess but
that type of injury you almost I think
they almost say those those bad of
injuries you don't you almost don't even
feel it yeah well there's I think
there's a line where if it gets so bad
that it's almost like your brain shuts
off of all the feeling that goes to that
part of your body until you look at it
and yeah and I don't know I think they
have to set that right like they have to
literally while he's still awake go okay
now we're gonna click your [ __ ] back in
place can you imagine that [ __ ] pain
oh my god what I'm under cuz that [ __ ]
would be bad oh yeah I was at the
hospital one time I was there with my
wife she was like she had like some pain
some [ __ ] and his old-ass lady came in
and they like said the same [ __ ] to her
that I think they asked you like ma'am
like what happened she was like I fell
and they're like like how much painting
when she was like a lot of pain I was
like you could probably help that lady
before you help looks like there's some
old-ass lady they just asked her basic
questions like like how much pain you I
was like she's old as [ __ ] and she's in
the hospital like probably just help her
I in a lot of pain yeah you know it's
funny how they had the system like that
like I would imagine I would hope that
if somebody comes into the hospital and
they're like I was a young kid and I
felt like I was having a heart attack so
it's understandable that I they would
hand me the form and say how bad your
pain and I listed a nine then obviously
they take everybody who's a 10 out of 10
before me like I get that but I would
hope that if somebody comes in in their
68 and they they're an old dude and they
look like they got a red face like
they're about to have a heart attack and
they're like oh did that person they
just take right away yeah yeah there's
some [ __ ] like that like when I'm at the
grocery store I've got a good amount of
[ __ ] and someone comes with like two
things I'll be a you got it maybe that's
the right movement that's that's the
right thing to do for sure
there's some things I'm not in a rush or
even like I've been on some [ __ ] lately
where if like the right exit lane is
backed up like a [ __ ]
I'll just skirt in the middle lane for
dumb long and then like skirt over and
cut mad people oh you do that quick
little bump over yeah I would sometimes
if I'm in the right lane I'll I'll be
like yeah you got it man like I know
you're trying to be a dick but I do this
all the time so cut in front of me well
see it's funny because I I I'm I'm the
opposite but I'm consistent with it so
like I've get tight when anybody tries
to cut in front of me at the end but I
don't try to do that to anybody okay
so then me you're allowed something yeah
so and so what I'm like and this happens
all the time like in that one place by
the George Washington Bridge and you're
trying to cross over yeah like that one
[ __ ] where people where everybody exits
and it's like at the end people just
like hop over real quick I'm like [ __ ]
you but again I never try but you know
what sometimes I'm too much of a
hard-ass because you got to be
understanding for people who might not
even know that [ __ ] area and they
their GPS tells them to go that way or
some [ __ ] and then they go that way and
it's like they did you can tell
you in person who [ __ ] up against the
person you like cause you see they'll
give you something if they [ __ ] up
like you'll give you a hand you know yes
something I do that I'll hit them with
like I'll tap my chest and I'll I'm you
know sorry sorry so yeah I'm big on that
if I [ __ ] up then I'm like my bad you
get your right your right one time I was
but recently I was like leaving a
parking lot and somebody like pulled out
in front of me but it did like it's
clear that cars could come from that way
but I just didn't think they were going
to yeah and so they were like yo and
there wasn't we didn't crash or anything
but like I had to slam on the brakes and
and the person was like what do you do I
was like yeah I know you're right my bed
my bed like what I'm going to allow them
to oh yeah I let her I lay was a her I
let her go through it like yeah like
come on you got it I was like yep that's
some things you know but then for that
person
they gotta allow you know like it's got
to be over like if you know you [ __ ]
up and you're allowing them to like
you're right they got they gotta hit you
with something back like respect for you
sitting there and taking this because
yeah I'm right do you know I'm right but
like sometimes they don't give you that
full feeling of like okay but they'll
hit you with like just a little
something to let you know like okay I
see that you get it so it's alright like
you're still trying to be tight but they
hit you with like okay he's being like
you can kind of sense in their [ __ ]
eye or in their yeah their facial
expression that they're like getting it
that I get it so they're like I guess
yeah and if not you [ __ ] pull up next
to them at the light and it's like you
give them that look just like I do that
I I don't get really mad on on driving
but if you are just like if you're
driving on their own like you like
anything you do is okay I mean I just
hang on slow switchin lanes or some [ __ ]
and you're just cutting people off just
on some you don't know what the [ __ ]
going on [ __ ] like not you're being a
dick you're just a bad driver yeah I
don't know what's going on I'll pull up
next to you at the light and just hit
you with some like yeah the ice grill is
always good alright I'll do the like
I'll talk but not to the person just
like talk out loud and they'll know
what's up yeah be like this [ __ ]
[ __ ] right here like you say something
like that then sometimes it's like tell
like they know what
ever you're saying even if like you're
not saying some [ __ ] you could be saying
something the totally different
direction if you pull up next to the car
and you're like this [ __ ] yeah and
they know you look at them they're like
baby heard me say that she yeah that's
true that's true
oh by the way while we were talking
about like [ __ ] stomach pains and [ __ ]
I had a weird dream last night I had a I
had a dream I don't remember most of it
I don't remember like a 95 percent of it
but there's one part I remember where I
think you me and one of our friends was
playing cards but then also showing
everybody your dick and then there was
another part where I think me and rush
limbaugh the right-wing radio host we're
gonna we're gonna play golf but like
we're sitting on a couch before we go
play golf I'm like yo man you ready to
go play and he's like he's got here like
a red face he was like yeah I'm ready
and then he's turns to the side and
starts throwing up and then he starts he
picked up like a garbage can start
throwing up in the garbage can then you
ran out and kept throwing up and I was
like well I guess we're not playing golf
anymore
it's a weird doing in the what was I
doing the Judas plane okay so there was
there was a different part of the dream
before the rush limbaugh part where like
I was playing cards you were playing
cards and our friend was playing cards
and I don't know the other characters
who were involved but then like directly
after that it was like you you
disappeared our friend disappeared and
then it's like cut to me sitting on a
couch a white couch with Rush Limbaugh's
like a look in porno oh my god imagine
it's a turn to do a [ __ ] rush
limbaugh for note see what a like it's
I'd wake up and just want to kill myself
yeah but he started throwing up and I
was like damn it's weird because like I
think the reason he was in the dream is
because he's like a talk show host I'm a
talk show host
he likes golf I like golf and I think
that was the connection that like could
see that yeah that like my brain was
like well you know hey he's a talk show
your talk show host you both play golf
so that's why you're about to play golf
with him yeah it was weird and that's um
I've had some good throw ups before
throw I'll never throw yeah
for me did I throw up and I was it I
felt great after you had like a
projectile joint once right
oh that okay that was a different time I
didn't feel great after that I've only
told up once did you do it okay yeah
throwing up no no I was gonna say I only
felt good once after I did it oh god
they're times I threw up and now it
wasn't like a relief it was just like I
just threw up but I still feel like [ __ ]
yeah yeah that the projectile when I
told the story here before it was New
Year's Eve I took a shitload of shots
and then standing outside with a bunch
of people and I tell them like yo I'm
about to throw up and they're like what
go over there behind the bushes and I
was like nah that one's an open my wife
in college like in bed sleeping while
you were both sleeping ya woke up just
with a whole shitload of like it wasn't
her only role yes or no no I don't think
it was in her face like I feel like you
would wake up from that yeah you have to
go from that yeah I think I just rolled
over and was just like oh no good wow
that's pretty funny though sorry Molly
look at this dusty I'm surprised she
like didn't leave me after that right
after that incident you didn't leave
you're like okay this could work really
really well it's weird how it's just
like you can you you'll consume some
[ __ ] it's good and then you just [ __ ]
throw it up and it's not good yeah yeah
but it's funny how like there was one
time the time that I threw up and I felt
good after it it was some stupid [ __ ]
like college thing and then I got drunk
as [ __ ] and I threw up but then right
after I finished throwing up I felt like
a million bucks I was like oh I feel
amazing now and then what did I do
I went and eat [ __ ] disco fries oh I
know after if you imagine after throwing
up you eat disco fries and it [ __ ] it
like gravy on it cheese on it ketchup
from a [ __ ] cheap-ass diner
wait so disco fries are is that a style
with like the meat and cheese and [ __ ]
on it well and to tell me that curly
fries weren't good and I was like you're
buggin
well.all fries are good all fries matter
hashtag all fries matter there's got to
be some fries that aren't
well there's there's levels but they're
all good like yeah that's true yeah I
mean you could say hey I'd like steak
fries better than [ __ ] waffle fries
or whatever but yeah they're all good
but no the disco fries I had were from
this and I don't know if they're the
same every diner or every place where
you can get disco fries but the one that
I had at this place it was either
regular fries or waffle fries with
cheese melted on top of it and then also
like gravy poured on it like almost like
the turkey gravy this was after you
threw up I would accent Aeneas Lee threw

real quick alright guys thank you for
joining me tonight for a special edition
of the Tim black ignite show I'm very
happy to bring the guests on the show
that has been around for quite a minute
he's been doing this thing he's the ever
popular host producer I would say owner
of the whole damn thing of secondly talk
give it up my friends for Kyle kolinsky
[Music]
appreciate that man without man I will
just tell him I look so much older I
feel like in this like like going okay
like it looks like adds 10 years to my
face but English do you ever hear
somebody say that when they see like
gray hair like oh you look distinguished
no a nice way to tell me I told you man
I got gray in a beard man so I'm making
you look young man so don't you worry
about this is you look good man you know
well I've been dyeing it since the fetus
I've been a teen so I've been fighting
it it's all good fight the fight man
it's look I look ladies and gentlemen my
fault periscope YouTube and Facebook
people welcome welcome to the show guys
thank you for tuning in happy Halloween
that's why I'm wearing this [ __ ] I'm
dressed as a lesbian softball coach it's
a good wood to know sometimes something
sticks and you don't want it to stick I
just gave up after all I'm like all
right you know what you guys got it so
look guys so anybody who doesn't know
Kyle is he's got a very popular YouTube
channel and he's been out there talking
about political commentary also also the
atheist like secular so how could you
let them know briefly like what your
channel is about man yeah sure sure so
when I when it started I probably
focused more well you know I've always
kind of focused more on on politics
actually but you know yes there's a
healthy dose of secularism just a
religiosity thrown in there and
obviously it's a we espouse a
progressive Democratic worldview secular
worldview and other than that it's just
really covering the news and things that
I find interesting pretty much we were
talking right before we came on here in
2008 is when I launched the YouTube
channel but that was just every now and
then I'd do a video just for fun
basically and then no.9 we started the
blog talk radio show and we did you know
I I do that for
- and then there was a break there when
I went to school and I was in the car
business for a year maybe like a year
and a half and then I decided maybe four
years ago now or five years ago now to
try to do secular talk full-time and
then I've been doing it full-time ever
since and I've been fortunate enough to
you know have it work well man give it
up for that man he's been having to work
that's for sure and I so be late man one
of the things he hits the cow story he
stayed with it
you know the main cow like I've seen
great people come and go man and the
only difference is some people stayed
and they fought through the the
downturns and other people gave up man
will you think about that I think you're
right I think showing up is probably the
biggest battle just if you just keep
showing up keep showing up keep showing
up they can't deny you and you know you
you've done that to you really really
worked hard and you got quite a
following and there's something to be
said you've got it from scratch and
there's really something to be said
about that because that's from the
bottom up working hard and basically
earning your stripes my brother my
brother man that's alright I appreciate
that and I bet money we discussed
earlier about you know for you
complimenting me on air I'll make sure I
get that outside but look part of my
success Pal is is bringing on great
people like you man bring it on Lee
can't bring it on Jimmy door you know
having you know people come through they
have a following is that you know on
their own and that helps as well it's my
pleasure to join you great work thanks
man thanks man look look like Kyle was
telling he's told me he was in the car
business for a while
and that that really had me trippin
because I did the car business for about
the same amount of time man what was one
of the turn offs to that business Kyle
for you for me I feel like it was
everything looking back at it because at
the time at the time I was like you know
what this is okay this is good and truth
be told when I'm not into something I
can be the laziest [ __ ] on the
planet am I allowed to curse you yeah
you good man we do monetize that don't
[ __ ] matter
so yeah it's uh I just I was lazy at it
because I didn't really care about it
and I you know I was talking about this
on my podcast with Korn recently how I
feel like I just would be too honest
with people almost where I'm like
whatever what do you want to know about
the car this one's all four-wheel drive
this one's whatever and when you don't
care about something it's hard to sell
it and so if somebody were to watch you
know my show or your show they might go
wow you guys are great people if you
will like we can push our idea as well
and we can argue for our idea as well
but again that's only because we
actually believe in and care about what
we're talking about and we're trying to
make a difference with something when it
was something like the car business I
just didn't care about it so I felt like
I was almost too honest as a salesperson
to a fault where I didn't give people
sometimes in the car business your
salesperson will want you to kind of
give them the salesmanship and walk them
down a path and lead them to the
conclusion that they want to get the car
whereas I was more of kind of like a
take it or leave it kind of dude and
when I look back at it it wasn't you
know I wasn't probably wasn't that
happiest when I was there when I was
doing it because I just and also because
of the money we were talking again
before all affair I was saying how at
the place where I worked we literally
made less than minimum wage the salesman
made less than minimum wage unless you
you pushed a whole bunch of Units out
and the way that they get you on that is
they say like oh don't worry you're
definitely gonna sell enough to make way
more than minimum wage but know some
ways that wasn't it pasted some weeks
that wasn't the case and you walk away
with two hundred dollars before taxes
going on here it's horrible man like but
the only good things about it that I
enjoyed doing my time was people being
excited about getting a new car or a new
to them car you know like I've had
families get that first like minivan and
the kids they're like jumping around and
everybody's happy it's like it's the
next biggest purchase for a lot of
people next to a home you know so I felt
good about giving them what they wanted
but on the back end sometimes like you
said man it was a it was a lot of hassle
you gotta jump cars in the middle of
winner yeah we'll jump thank you they
made us as salespeople palpable when
there was snow for hours on end and
again I'd be like we're not even making
minimum wage you're not paying us hourly
like what you can't do that but they
just do it and then this is one of those
things man that made me like I thought
about this a lot after the fact that
they should have a law that's a no
exception to the minimum wage law I mean
obviously you and I both agree there
should be a living wage not just a
minimum wage there should be a no
exception the minimum wage law they
always try to get people on that whether
it's its waiters you know or whether
it's people who work on Commission and
they succeed and we all know that's
because those industries give money to
politicians and that's a great point man
I like that segue into into an issue
that we both talk about a lot man living
wage grow the thing that gets me cow man
is how many people are there really out
there who don't want a higher minimum
wage I don't get it man we you think
yeah I think well the polls show it's
about 80 percent they want to raise the
minimum wage I think it varies like when
you go if you go $12 versus $15 it
depends how you phrase it and it depends
what number you give people but
according to most most polls even most
Republicans want to raise the minimum
wage so that's one of those issues where
like the American people are pretty
United and the only people that are
against us it's Washington and the
corporations yeah though I mean that's
it's just a shame that that's one of
those things where because some money in
politics we haven't been able to move
forward when everybody already agrees
it's like with with guns too I mean
everybody agrees to do a background
check that's not a controversial thing
like everybody agrees to that 93 percent
and we still don has it and we don't
have it because the corrupting influence
of money ya know I will admit man my
feelings about gun control have changed
a little as I became more educated but
I'm with you on the gun you know on
actual background checks I know most
states do have some form of background
checks but they're like loopholes as you
can get through as far as like the gun
auctions if you go to a you know you
know whatever so it's not as
comprehensive as we like it to be mad
but but yeah I've never met a gun on and
that illegal gun on anyway cuz I met
someone who were illegal um whoever said
I don't want background checks cuz they
got kids too man families they want to
live yeah I always said I'm kind of
moderate on that issue overall gun
control I'm curious so what did you used
to thinking what do you think now where
do you fall on it today I used to think
all of the evil in the world was
primarily behind guns like guns and
that's because of my environment that I
was when I was a young teenager like I
left home when I was 17 man and you know
I've lived in a situation where people
were living the street life and they
were they was you know dealing with
drugs you know living like living
basically like what they could steal
from a department store just doing
anything to get by and I met a lot of
people man who friends who who you know
had issues with their parents ended up
out there and the thing that killed him
was it like you know you know drugs per
se but it was like guns like that's
that's what took a lot of the people I
went to school with and people I met
later so to me guns had always been an
issue it the instrument by which my
friends died but what changed me car was
people on my channel as that got more
involved in you know in a commentary who
started waking me up to some of the
other issues surrounding it so it wasn't
necessarily the gun of course the gun is
the instrument but there are also other
factors and and I think that just sort
of opened me up I had to also think
about single women people living by
themselves in these environments who
need some protection Who am I to tell
them they shouldn't protect themselves
you know if you if your girlfriend is
coming home late and you're out of town
or whatever she might want to you know
she's coming home from waitressing at
2:00 in the morning Who am I to tell her
she shouldn't be able to you know make
sure she's gonna be ok I mean I don't
know if it's a fool I don't know she
could do an actual TJ Hooker or I don't
know man I don't know if she can do uh
if she could protect herself to the
level where I could say she's definitely
gonna be able to take this guy out I
just got to be pretty good but the
option should be there for a law abiding
citizen and
my opinion that if that makes them feel
a little safer Who am I man
yeah Who am I you know I just I just
looked at a different man my sister she
lives pretty far away and she's married
now but when she wasn't these are things
I thought about so yeah man what about
you like you said your moderate what's
what's the matter with me I think when I
was younger I moved I moved left overall
because when I was younger I think I was
fully libertarian on this issue where I
was you know I'd basically make the
point of yeah people don't treat people
who are not criminals the same way you
treat somebody who's a criminal if
they're not going to do something wrong
with it of course and let them let them
have it
but I did start moving left as time went
by because it just struck me as I want
to treat guns the same way that I prefer
to treat drugs and my whole thing on
drugs is I want a legal tax and regulate
them I want to legalize them tax them
and regulate it but a lot hinges on that
last word regulation so if you ask me
like when I leave you lies crystal meth
or I legalize bath salts I'd say no
because that's an extreme version of
those drugs but I think like a you know
like for example instead of having crack
or cocaine available at people we could
have sell adderall over-the-counter I'm
fine with that
so I'm in favor legalizing these things
but you know basically doing it in a way
where it shuts down the black market or
really hurts the black market and gives
people more liberty and freedom and I
feel the same way with guns so in other
words the thought that like I was like
oh I'm obviously in favor of some
regulation is when I realized oh I don't
want you know leave this in Kentucky to
have nuclear weapons or a chemical
weapon or a tank or a grenade launcher
or and then you just go down the list
and then you realize everybody has a
line it's just a matter of where you
draw the line and you know I think it's
reasonable to say obviously fully
automatic weapons people shouldn't have
maybe semi-automatic too but okay it's a
little more debatable on that one but I
just want to treat it like I treat drugs
or like I treat cars where you know I
think there should be background checks
I think there should be testing I think
you should make it a permit system you
should make it so that
it's treated with the responsibility
that it's that it deserves and I think
that if you were to just do basic
regulation like ban high-capacity
magazines and do universal background
checks I think if you just do very minor
things you actually see a really
significant drop in the number of gun
deaths and you know it's a hard
conversation to have to say hey what
number are we okay with you know what I
mean like and what number can we say
okay we'll live with that in society a
certain number of people dealing with
this horrible issue but I mean that is a
real discussion because we with alcohol
for example we all agree like okay we're
gonna have it because we believe in
freedom but yeah some people are gonna
there's gonna be alcohol poisoning and
some people are gonna be alcoholics and
it's the tough thing but you don't take
it away from everybody because of them
so it's just a matter of where are we
gonna draw the line and how much will it
affect the outcome and I'm in favor of
some you know very moderate gun reforms
that I think would help significantly in
terms of taking down that number of over
ten thousand homicides every year in the
u.s. excellent point
I agree I agree with most of it I think
that a it's a very nuanced issue man it
all depends on where you come from
I know people like for instance a part
of what changed my view was knowing
people that grew up with guns like I
didn't grow up that way like we didn't
have guns in the house but you know
being a you know pretty much coming of
age in the eighties early nineties is
when I came out really you know got into
the world you know there were people at
the same time I was taking classes in
school well they'd have gun classes like
I grew up in Maryland I was born in DC
raised in Maryland
closer - DC area and just in there like
30 mile radius you got Virginia in
Northern Virginia Maryland DC all
different you know laws on guns
extremely different laws on guns and
just over the border and DC I mean in
Virginia like I said man it was a
culture of guns like it was a regular
thing it was not you know a criminal
like only guys who wanted to rob people
had guns I mean this is just you know
shotguns for huntin shotguns to protect
your home it's just a regular life so I
had to take that in consideration
my worldview got bigger as I met these
people and and then when I met them and
talk to them they call it a show because
you know I do a call-in show Kyle you
know and and I learned from these people
you know like I don't know what it's
like to live in Appalachia yeah they
call them break it down for a brother
and I'm like okay so I that's what got
me going man but I like you I love you
staying on drugs man like of course
brother don't want crystal meth
legalized cool man who you know like I'm
like legalized cannabis you know I guess
people would say you can't pick the
choose your dress I can't just say
you're not gonna let people have grenade
launchers like you're not gonna let them
have those times a web anti-aircraft
missiles you not gonna let have had that
it's the same thing with drugs you're
not gonna let somebody have crystal meth
or bath salts or something that's Oh
crocodile that's the one that was the
heroin knock off the made people off
like it's okay to regulate that there's
no problem with that
and by the way I might surprise people
because I actually spoke about Oh some
people grew up with guns and stuff I'm
one of those people
even though born and raised liberal New
York I mean my my dad when he was
growing up his dad had like a farm or
something a good two hours north of New
York City and when I was a kid we would
go up there maybe twice a year three
times a year or something and when I was
there when I was a kid he had me
shooting guns I mean I was a little kid
shooting a Ruger 22 at like old bleach
bottle that they poured water in or
something I get it I'm like eh that's
what it's funny I always find it funny
when son there are some people online
who would try to portray me as massively
anti-gun but I always say you're just
you're just not listening to what I'm
saying then because I do have a more
moderate take on it and again I grew up
in a situation like that so I don't want
to treat somebody who's just hunting or
whatever just live in their life the
same way that you would treat a guy like
Dylan roof for having guns or you know a
terrorist it's obvious it's obviously a
not an issue that's black and white
there's a lot of gray area and there's
things we can do to fix the situation
but also maintain as much freedom and
liberty as possible speaking
yesterday we had another terrible mass
shooting at least 26 people were killed
at a church in Sutherland Springs Texas
on Sunday law enforcement confirmed that
there were also many more injuries the
shooter is also dead following a brief
chase
there was a Good Samaritan who got in
his car and basically chased this guy
down and there was a shootout between
the two of them and then it appears like
there was a self-inflicted gunshot wound
on the part of the perpetrator the Texas
governor Greg Abbott said quote as a
state we are dealing with the largest
mass shooting in our state's history so
here's what we know to this point about
the the shooting the shooting reportedly
occurred at the First Baptist Church in
Sutherland Spring Springs Texas around
11:30 a.m. local time this is from Vox
by the way at least 26 people were
killed although it's not clear if that
number will rise approximately 20 others
were injured the shooter is dead
following a car pursuit by local
resident it's unclear if he killed
himself or was killed by someone else
since then I think they've established
that he indeed killed himself the
victims ages range from five years old
to 72 years old First Baptist Church
pastor Frank Pomeroy's 14 year old
daughter and all of his families close
friends were killed in the attack this
is what Pomeroy told houston-based ABC
13 the shooter has been identified as 26
year old Devon Patrick Kelly law
enforcement officials told CBS and NBC
Kelly was previously in the Air Force
but he was court-martialed
and sentenced to a bad conduct discharge
according to the Daily Beast I'm gonna
come back to that in just a second here
local state and federal law enforcement
are on the ground there is no other
threat in the area at the time according
to law enforcement Sutherland Springs is
about 30 miles southeast of San Antonio
it's an unincorporated community with a
population of about 400 according to San
Antonio based Fox 29 the church
regularly post videos of its service
and it shows you know a vibrant
community with parishioners singing
playing electric guitar and talking
about all types of things so I told you
I'd come back and I'd revisit his bad
conduct discharge from the Air Force
he was discharged because he assaulted
his wife and his kid
he's a domestic abuser he was still
legally able to purchase guns Donald
Trump came out after the shooting and
said well I mean look let's don't blame
the gun this is a mental health issue is
what this is and the problem is not guns
the problem is that this guy had a gun
so blame him blame the individual and
guess what according to his own logic he
did the wrong thing because it was the
Trump administration it was the
Republicans who recently signed a piece
of legislation that said if you are - if
you're not have sound enough mind to
control your finances and you're on
Social Security they say you should be
able to have a gun it was under Obama
that he said okay listen if somebody if
we already know as a matter of fact that
somebody is not have sound enough mind
to control their finances they're not
have sound enough mind to control a
firearm well Trump and the Republicans
disagreed and they got rid of that rule
so even according to his own logic of
wobba don't blame the gun per se you
blame but this particular person in the
fact that this person had a gun okay
well you've shown repeatedly that you're
actually okay with people with severe
mental issues having guns in fact you
know the Republicans have been on a tear
attempting to gut Medicaid I mean they
didn't do the Medicaid expansion under
Obama care but that's one fact but in
Trump care and all the different
versions they cut Medicaid for
further well guess what Medicaid is one
of the is not one of the it is the
number one provider of mental health
care in the country so you don't get to
do the tap dance and say oh mental
illness mental illness mental illness
when you are in favor of people with
severe mental issues getting a gun and
you're also not in favor of treating
those mental illnesses because you're
gutting the program that treats them so
this is the tap dance and we go round
and round and round and nothing gets
accomplished even though these shootings
keep happening and by the way let me
show you this chart here because this is
something else this shows us the 5
deadliest shootings in in modern US
history they've all come in the last 10
years and two of them in the past six
weeks so the number one worst mass
shooting just happened in Las Vegas 58
people killed what was it over 300
people injured that just happened and
now you know
a month later 26 people killed in
Sutherland Springs Texas and you go down
the list there there was the one in
Orlando Florida the pulse nightclub
shooting that was in 2016
Virginia Tech 2007 the Sandy Hook 2012
you go down the list there and if it
feels like they're occurring more often
it's because they are and we live in a
country that so corrupt and the system
is so rotten that even when 93% of the
American people say I want a universal
background check a comprehensive
universal background check for gun
purchases we don't get that past we
don't get that into law I mean that's
wild man in what's supposed to be a
representative democracy you would think
that the politicians would represent you
enough where when 93% of you want
something we get it I mean that's a
pretty open-and-shut case is it not but
no we don't get it why because the NRA
pays a tremendous amount of money to
Republican politicians and they block
any and all reform on this issue no
matter how common
sensical it is I mean 93% universal
background check we can't get that 60%
want to ban on high-capacity magazines
we can't get that and by the way you
know how sometimes sometimes it's the
case where you look at a shooting and
you go I don't know what law could have
prevented this because sometimes a law
couldn't have prevented it because the
facts of the matter or just hey the
person didn't have anything messed up in
their background or you know for
whatever reason a specific law wouldn't
have stopped a specific case well this
is one of those cases where a law would
have stopped it you know by the way the
Dylan roof one they didn't complete the
background check on Dylan roof before
they sold him his weapon if we had a
longer waiting period between when he
goes to purchase his gun when he
actually gets his gun perhaps the Dylan
roof one could have been prevented
because he would have failed the
background check in this instance if the
guy is a domestic abuser I mean any
thorough background check that has you
know rules linked to that would go yeah
we're not selling to you because you're
a domestic abuser so this isn't a lot to
ask for man this is not a lot to ask for
to say let's have a background check
let's have rules as to who can and
cannot buy it and then people go well
listen but Kyle that's not gonna work
because then well who's to say that
these people won't go on the black
market and get a gun that way and then
end up doing the same thing yes in some
of those cases but you will prevent many
of these shootings because these laws
deter some people from going that extra
steps some people might not have the
connect to get a gun on the black market
or something like that
so what we're talking about here is is
macro statistics and we live in a
country where over 10,000 people die
every year from homicides from guns we
have over 32,000 that die from gun
violence now that number admittedly
includes homicides suicides accidents so
yes in
you go totally you know full-on
authoritarian and ban all guns you're
not gonna cut that number two like under
a hundred people and I'm not in favor of
banning guns as I've stated a thousand
times but what I am in favor of is
regulation to drastically reduce that
number the over 32,000 gun deaths and
the over 10,000 homicides and there's no
doubt that simple reforms would achieve
that goal I mean we should be treating
guns like we treat cars we should have
you know a permitting system we
obviously should have a universal
background check
you know ar-15s have been using almost
all these shootings why are those still
legal so ban on high-capacity magazines
this is not a lot to ask for you know if
you're somebody who is a law-abiding
citizen and you want a gun for
protection
I'm not I'm nobody to tell you you can't
have that I think you should have that
but that doesn't mean that a guy who was
a domestic abuser and it was on his
record and we knew about it doesn't mean
that that guy should legally be able to
get a gun and if you disagree with that
then you're I think you're just being
stubborn on purpose you're trying you're
searching for a reason to disagree even
though you know it's totally
unreasonable to disagree on that front
so it's just sad man they keep happening
they keep happening and it really is
soul-sucking and soul-crushing
where we I feel every time I see one of
these I feel so utterly and completely
helpless because if we had an instance
where children were massacred at Sandy
Hook okay and then we had an instance
where 58 people were killed
58 in Las Vegas and now we have an
instance here where 26 people are killed
at least and all of those happening and
all those happening very recently
haven't led to any any change any reform
well then you know what that onion
article seems prescient and profound you
know the one that they always tweet out
after a mass shooting
you know it's something along the lines
of there's nothing we can do to stop
this says the only nation where it
regularly happens there's a lot we can
do to reduce the number of these things
reduce the casualty rate but obviously
money needs to not corrupt our politics
because the Republicans are doing the
bidding of the NRA and you also need to
have people who are willing to be
intellectually honest about what the
problem is and many people are not and
then of course the the final point I'll
make here is the difference in reaction
listen when you had it just it's just a
fact that when you look at the reaction
after the Las Vegas shooting 58 people
dead hundreds injured that story
amazingly was pretty much gone in the
media after three days so there's three
days of coverage then it kind of petered
out and and that was that and at first
people were like hey maybe we banned
bump stocks which is the least you could
do because it turns semi-automatic
weapons into fully automatic weapons but
then they even the conversation about
that petered out the Democrats don't
keep the pressure on cuz they're [ __ ]
idiots and they don't know how to be
strong and they don't know how to fight
for what they should believe in and you
know this is an instance where I'm
keeping my eye on it I think the same
thing is gonna happen give it three days
and it'll peter out and the response
from the right when you look at for
example the terrorist attack that just
happened in New York where far fewer
people died and that's not to downplay
it again it's just to state the fact of
the matter I think it was nine people
who died in the terror attack in New
York when you turned on right-wing media
outlets it was wall-to-wall coverage of
that and it was oh my god we have to do
something about it we have to do
something about it now and of course
this is what they used to call for
immigration bans and further extreme
vetting even though we have extreme
vetting and all this stuff but it's
amazing how they go depending on the
identity of the shooter they go on the
offense in one instance - totally plain
defense in the other instance where now
it's like you know they say whoa whoa
whoa what do you mean no
this is I mean this is a lone wolf this
is a guy with a mental illness and this
is not so there's nothing we could do
about this I mean this is basically the
the price of freedom an even [ __ ]
morning joke pointed this out on MSNBC
he said imagine this shooter who went
into a church and killed at least 26
people and shot a five-year-old and a 70
some-odd year-old imagine this person's
name was Mohammed imagine their name was
Mohammed and then think about the
reaction and how quickly people would
want to do something and by the way in
that instance probably do something that
would not directly address the problem
because like for example every time they
talk about solutions to Islamic
terrorism they want to do stuff like
what the so called Muslim ban which
doesn't even put countries like Saudi
Arabia on the list by the way none favor
of a ban it's not a good idea but if
you're gonna try to identify a threat
maybe the place where most of the
attackers on 9/11 came from would be the
number-one place
maybe the [ __ ] you know extremist
Wahhabi state would be the number-one
place but no they're our allies so they
get off the list and then what he gonna
do ban people from [ __ ] use Becca San
when this is the one attacker maybe ever
from Uzbekistan in the US so you know
their solutions are irrational even when
they want to call for solutions in
certain circumstances but it's amazing
how there's no discussion of potential
solutions when it's a white dude with a
gun there's none whatsoever in
right-wing circles and listen man people
say you can't politicize a tragedy
everything's already political and yes
that that includes when there's a Muslim
terrorist attack that includes when
there's a right-wing terror attack that
includes when there's a mass shooting so
it is only perfectly logical after all
these things happen to you know discuss
what to do to try to prevent the next
one from occurring and we're not really
doing that and I don't think anything's
gonna get accomplished and you know in
in far right-wing circles online you
know who they're blaming this on and
Tifa
because there was a joke tweet that blew
up where you know people were talking we
covered this story were left wingers
were kind of mocking and trolling right
wingers and saying on November 4th and
Tifa super soldiers will behead all
white parents in the public square or
something to that effect and it's
obvious jokes and what happened many
right-wing outlets said what they were a
day late but here it is here it is on
November 5th they're killing all these
white people unbelievable antiva terror
terror group it's like it doesn't matter
what the facts are as always go go back
to the narrative here here the facts I
will go back to the narrative facts and
narrative facts narrative doesn't matter
if there's no connection doesn't matter
if it makes absolutely no sense just you
know hey how can I find a way to spin
this to blame it on an Tifa I saw some
call on this guy oh he converted to
Islam zero evidence of that at all even
though the answer in this instance is
literally right in front of our faces
the guy was a domestic abuser obviously
had serious issues and he was still
legally allowed to get a gun oh it's
really sad and this is gonna keep
happening it's gonna keep happening
unless there's a giant offensive from
the Democrats to say no this isn't gonna
happen anymore and here exactly what our
proposals are I love how you know Obama
and Biden they tweeted about this and
they said we need to come up with strong
clear solutions on gun reform
why don't you list them this is the
Democratic diseased is weakness and
vagueness you know like you literally
can go out there after the shooting and
say universal background checks no
exceptions
ban on high-capacity magazines a
permitting system ban on assault weapons
you can list what you think the
solutions are but a legit say we must do
something and then that something gets
watered down so much to the point where
it's [ __ ] nothing we're even the bump
stock bad just the bump stock ban which
prevents semi
max from becoming fully automatics even
that died and it died because the
Democrats are weak and they don't fight
even though this is an opportunity it's
an opportunity to give the American
people what they want and what they
desperately need and deserve it's an
opportunity to fight to stand up for
what your values are supposed to be but
that's exactly the problem when you
don't really believe in anything
then everything Peters out and flounders
away and oscillates in the [ __ ]
atmosphere and just becomes irrelevant
so here we are yet again another giant
tragedy and Congress will continue to
sit around with their thumbs up their
ass
so Donna Brazile who was the the head of
the DNC the interim head of the DNC
after debbie Wasserman Schultz was
ousted after it was found that you know
she was basically cheating and rigging
the primary for Hillary Clinton and
biasing the DNC in her favor Donna
Brazile took over and she was also
seemingly a faithful servant of Hillary
Clinton's campaign there was of course
the big scandal where it was found
through the WikiLeaks emails that Donna
Brazile was leaking debate questions to
Hillary Clinton before the debates when
Donna Brazile was working at CNN so her
hands are not clean in any of this but
she basically wrote a Mia culpa and came
out and said yeah mm-hmm WikiLeaks was
right the Bernie camp was right
everything they thought was happening
indeed was happening and I'm gonna give
you the inside story of it so damn she's
coming clean about the situation that
was happening at the DNC and it's oh
it's worse than even I thought so she
wrote a big article in Politico now by
the way don't get it twisted
I think she's doing this because she has
a book coming out so she wants to like
drop a bombshell here so that people go
buy her book but I don't think that
takes away from the truth of the claims
that she makes in this I think that this
really does back up what the Bernie camp
has been saying all along so she wrote a
big article and it's titled inside
Hillary Clinton's secret takeover of the
DNC when I was asked to run the
Democratic Party after the Russians
hacked our emails I stumbled onto a
shocking truth about the Clinton
campaign now here are some of the the
key excerpts from this article that give
you the specifics she says the Saturday
morning after the convention in July I
called Gary Gensler the chief financial
officer of Hillary's campaign he wasted
no words he told me the Democratic Party
was broke and two million dollars in
debt what ice
dreamed I am an officer of the party and
they've been telling me everything is
fine and they were raising money with no
problems that wasn't true he said
officials from Hillary's campaign had
taken a look at the DNC's books Obama
left the party 24 million dollars in
debt 15 million in bank debt and more
than 8 million owed to vendors after the
2012 campaign had been paying that off
very slowly Obama's campaign was not
scheduled to pay it off until 2016
Hillary for America the campaign and
Hillary victory fund its joint
fundraising vehicle with the DNC had
taken care of 80% of the remaining debt
in 2016 about 10 million and had placed
the party on an allowance if I didn't
know about this
I assume that none of the other officers
knew about it either
that was just Debbie's way in my
experience she didn't come to the
officers of the DNC for advice and
counsel she seemed to make decisions on
her own and let us know at the last
minute what she had decided as she had
done when she told us about the hacking
only minutes before the Washington Post
broke the news on the phone
Gary told me the DNC had needed a two
million dollar loan which the campaign
had arranged no that can't be true I
said the party cannot take out a loan
without the unanimous agreement of all
the officers Gary how did they do that
do this without me knowing I asked I
don't know how Debbie relates to the
officers gary said he described the
party as fully under the control of
Hillary's campaign which seemed to
confirm the suspicions of the Bernie
camp the campaign had the DNC on life
support giving it money every month to
meet its basic expenses while the
campaign was using the party as a
fundraising clearinghouse under FEC law
an individual can contribute a maximum
of $2,700 directly to a presidential
campaign but the limits were much higher
for contributions to state parties and a
party's National Committee individuals
who had maxed out their $2,000 700
contra
and limit to the campaign could write an
additional check for three hundred and
fifty three thousand four hundred
dollars to the Hilary Victory Fund that
figure represented ten thousand dollars
to each of the of the 32 states parties
who were part of the victory fund
agreement three hundred and twenty
thousand and three hundred thirty
thousand four hundred to the DNC the
money would be deposited deposited in
the state's first in the state's first
and transferred to the DNC shortly after
that money in the battleground states
usually stayed in that state but all the
other states funneled that money
directly to the DNC which quickly
transferred the money to Brooklyn wait I
said that victory fund was supposed to
be for whoever was the nominee and the
state party races you're telling me that
Hillary has been controlling it since
before she got the nomination gary said
the campaign had to do it or the party
would collapse quote that was the deal
that Robbie struck with Debbie he
explained referring to campaign manager
Robby Mook it was to sustain the DNC we
sent the party nearly twenty million
dollars from September until the
convention and more to prepare for the
election I at last found the document
that described it all the joint
fundraising agreement between the DNC
the Hillary victory fund and Hillary for
America the agreement signed by Amy
Dacey the former CEO of the DNC and
Robby Mook with a copy to mark Elias
specified that in exchange for raising
money and investing in the DNC Hillary
would control the party's finances
strategy and all the money raised her
campaign had the right to right of
refusal of who would be the party's
communications director and it would
make final decisions on all the other
staff the DNC also was required to
consult with the campaign about all
other staffing budgeting data analytics
and mailings holy [ __ ] I had been
wondering why it was that I couldn't
write a press release without passing it
by Brooklyn well he
was the answer Donna Brazile is saying
the DNC was just another arm of the
Clinton campaign that's how far this one
went
that's worse than even I thought I
thought well okay debbie Wasserman
Schultz is Hillary Clinton's friend and
they love each other and debbie is in an
independent way running things that bias
everything in favor Hillary Clinton
that's what I thought no it's way way
way deeper than that
there was literally a contract a
financial agreement that gives Hillary
control over the entire DNC gives them
control over who's hired and who's fired
gives them control over strategy you
couldn't write a press release with from
the DNC without running it by Hillary
Clinton first and by the way the other
dirty trick and she goes on to say this
and the articles like this is basically
like money laundering for her campaign
so you know there are limits when you're
running a presidential campaign to make
direct contributions to the candidate
there are limits but there's not limits
to or the limits are much higher to
political parties so what does she do
say hey we're basically gonna take over
the DNC keep them on a starvation
allowance pay them as little as possible
and then we get to be the beneficiaries
of the much bigger fundraising that you
can do coming through the DNC oh my god
oh my god oh my god now by the way it is
she goes on and there's a part of the
article where she tells she calls Bernie
Sanders and tells him about this and
she's expecting Bernie to go [ __ ]
nuts and fly off the handle and go are
you kidding me that I mean this is worse
than anybody imagined and all that stuff
he doesn't do that you know what his
first comment
and boy this is telling about the kind
of guy Bernie Sanders is Bernie said how
bad is it so in other words Hillary's
campaign took over the DNC in every
conceivable way rigged the thing from
the top down to benefit her Bernie
realizing that goes how bad is it
donna brazile goes I don't trust the
polls she's not she's up in all the
polls I see a clear lack of enthusiasm
for her everywhere around the country
that I've traveled so in other words
this is Bernie saying okay you rigged it
against me that's messed up but it's
Donald Trump about to be President
because of what you did here is that
what's gonna happen how bad is it when
you rigged the thing from the top down
you push an unpopular candidate on
everybody because you have the levers of
the entire Democratic Party working in
your favor well now you just put
yourself in a potentially a no-win
situation where people are really not
all that excited about you because they
could smell the [ __ ] from a mile
away and they saw there was some [ __ ]
going on so Donna Brazile said look I
don't like it we're in a terrible
situation now but there's a lack of
enthusiasm for her and we got to make
sure Donald Trump doesn't become
president and Bernie said okay you know
you're right he basically swallowed his
pride campaigned for her as tough as he
could but not even the more popular
candidate Bernie Sanders can make
Hillary Clinton appealing enough to win
the election and that is exactly because
Hillary's campaign had total control of
the DNC from early on in the process now
let me tell you what the response is
gonna be to this everybody in the Bernie
camp is vindicated hundred-percent
totally and every step of the way the
corporate establishment the mainstream
media and corporate Democrats it no no
conspiracy theory oh they gave Bernie a
fair shake got confessions
Sage's conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy
I predict they will now flip on a dime
and go from it was a conspiracy it's not
true - well of course it's true but
everybody already knew it so let's get
past it guaranteed guaranteed I put
everything on it guaranteed it's not
happening it's a conspiracy crazy Bernie
bros - well yeah that was happening we
already knew that of course it's
happening shut up about it let's move on
and now we're supposed to believe that
Tom Perez is running this thing legit
when Tom Perez is Obama's guy Obama
wanted Hillary more than anybody worked
behind the scenes to get her to run
convinced Biden not to run because
Hillary was running and Obama gets his
guy the DNC the DNC they purged all the
Bernie supporters and keith ellison
supporters the other day we cover that
story they're still doing it for christ
sake they're still [ __ ] doing it
after your [ __ ] led to donald trump
getting elected Donald Trump is
president because the DNC was an arm a
Hillary Clinton campaign they pushed her
on the American people they rigged the
process we lost because of what you did
and you're [ __ ] doing it again
you're doing it right in front of our
eyes get the [ __ ] out of the way it was
the great philosopher Mystikal who said
move [ __ ] get out the way because
Justice Democrats are coming for you
we're not gonna we're not gonna stand
for this we're not gonna take this you
expect us to lay on the ground in a
chalk outline of ourselves and go well
it's permanently gonna be rigged it how
about no how about we overtake the party
and you know what I now think taken over
the party's gonna be easier than always
button because the the how deep the
corruption goes is so ridiculous that if
you wrote it in a movie plot people
would go come on you're stretching it
that's how bad this corruption is again
the take the Clinton campaigns control
the DNC was so thorough
complete and total that it's more than
even I thought way more than I thought
you couldn't write a [ __ ] press
release without getting Hillary Clinton
to approve it and then they had the
nerve the shameless liars they are cuz
every step of the way when somebody made
that pointer in the campaign what did
they say got conspiracy no of course
we're giving Bernie a fair shot of
course the thing the DNC is not taking
sides what are you talking about
you had so thoroughly taken aside that
the DNC
was the Clinton side it was an arm of
the [ __ ] campaign the fundraising
agreement made it that that was the case
and then furthermore the idea wasn't
even a mutually beneficial agreement
they kept the DNC on a starvation diet
giving them as little money as possible
to just continue operating and
everything else goes to the Clinton
campaign and they get to control every
aspect of the DNC who's hired who's
fired what the messaging is and again
there's unbelievable scumbags with how
brazen they were in their lies cuz this
isn't an issue where it's like hey maybe
they just they weren't meaning to lie
but they said something that was
misleading not on purpose it was 100% on
purpose every time they told you know
we're giving it of course we're giving
everybody a fair shake we're a DNC isn't
bias in favor of Hillary Clinton that
was a brazen lie because they made that
point as they knew they had a joint
fundraising agreement that gave Hillary
control of the entire goddamn party and
by the way what else is the consequence
of this if you are making a deal with
Hillary so that you can continue going
about your business the DNC well how is
why would you do that will you do that
because Hillary has the connections to
Wall Street Hillary has the connections
to Big Pharma hillary has the
connections to corporate America who are
gonna keep funneling money to her
because they know that she's gonna do
their bidding when she's elected so
Hillary has enough money to go yeah sure
will siphon for
million dollars a month or whatever it
is to the DNC that's fine because that
gives me total control of the party and
I'm getting my money through corporate
America so Hillary's whole movement was
based on keeping the Democratic Party
corporate that's the whole point with
her in control it keeps the DNC
corporate and of course her and her
campaign corporate and at this point
there's no distinction between what the
DNC is and what Hillary's campaign was
again Donna Brazile is her hands are not
cleaning this she's the one who you know
leaked questions to Hillary Clinton
before the debates when she was at CNN
and by the way she was fired because of
that she was fired but what this is is a
total and utter vindication of the
WikiLeaks emails excuse me this is a
total and complete vindication the
WikiLeaks emails it's an admission yeah
they're true yes the Bernie camp was
right all along
and yes the control the Clinton campaign
had at the DNC every step of the way was
even more than you imagined and they
have the nerve to tell you it's a fair
process and everything was on the up and
up no it wasn't so don't blame people
for not trusting a goddamn word out of
the DNC we're not gonna donate to the
DNC we're gonna take down the DNC we're
gonna take over the DNC just as
Democrats calm slash fight
big New York Times report came out this
week Clinton campaign and Democratic
Party helped pay for Russia Trump
dossier uh-oh
so they say the presidential campaign of
Hillary Clinton and the Democratic
National Committee paid for research
that was included in a dossier made
public in January that contains
salacious claims about connections
between Donald J Trump his associates
and Russia
a spokesperson for a law firm said on
Tuesday that it had hired Washington
based researchers last year to gather
damaging information about mr. Trump on
numerous subjects including possible
ties to Russia on behalf of the Clinton
campaign in the DNC the revelation which
emerged from a letter filed in court on
Tuesday is likely to fuel new partisan
attacks over federal and congressional
investigations into Russia's attempt to
disrupt last year's election and whether
any of mr. Trump's associates assisted
in the effort the president and his
allies have argued for months that the
investigations are politically motivated
they have challenged the information
contained in the dossier which was
compiled by a former British spy who had
been contracted by the Washington
research firm Fuzion GPS okay so yet
again you do understand what this means
right now this piece is in the New York
Times nobody can argue the New York
Times is more Pro Trump than Pro Hillary
of course they're more Pro Hillary
that's a given there the New York Times
and this is in the New York Times not in
the opinion section this is a piece in
The New York Times saying yes it was
discovered through court proceedings
that remember the the the PP tape
dossier cuz that's what they're
referring to here they're saying yeah by
the way the people who financed that it
was kind of a DNC and Hillary Clinton's
campaign wait wait wait what what whoa
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa hold on
now
guys the Clinton campaign just spent the
last couple months repeating over and
over and over and the Democratic Party
corporate Democrats just spent the last
few months saying over and over and over
Donald Trump colluded with Russia Donald
Trump colluded with Russia Donald Trump
colluded with Russia and you can't do
that in an election and then with this
report we now know that apparently the
Clinton campaign colluded with Russia
they colluded with a former British spy
to get information from Russian
officials on you know dirt on Donald
Trump now listen to me largely
irrelevant as long as the information
we're talking about is accurate as long
as it's true here's the problem and I
expressed this from day one when the PP
tape allegations came out extraordinary
claims require extraordinary evidence
there indeed is no evidence of the PP
tape sorry it's not like I'm soft on
Trump I mean I'm the guy who calls some
terrorist dawn for his repeated claims
of we have to take out their families
and by the way he did his first military
raid its president killed an
eight-year-old American girl increasing
drone strikes by 432 percent he's a
monster so I'm not soft on Trump but
there was just no evidence for the PP
tape now you ready for this how much was
paid by the DNC in the Clinton campaign
to their lawyers okay and this research
firm that did the opposition research is
part of that group with the lawyers they
paid twelve point four million dollars
to them Wow
you know I don't know about you guys but
to me it looks like twelve point four
million dollars is this is a significant
amount of money where you can pretty
much get anybody any unscrupulous person
to tell
you whatever the [ __ ] you want to hear
hey here's twelve point four million
dollars go get me some dirt on Trump oh
well there's see what happened was
somebody had told somebody who somebody
had told somebody that Donald Trump
there's a pee-pee tape and Trump likes
to watch hookers piss on the bed or
something so listen man I said it a
million times I'll say it a million more
in my mind the only thing that matters
is is the information true or not that's
why with the WikiLeaks stuff it's so
important to discuss it because its
internal DNC emails and we learned that
it's true it's true that they rigged the
primary against Bernie Sanders it's a
fact so you can't just say oh it maybe
came from Russia so let's dismiss it no
it is accurate that the DNC emails are
proven so that's why it's important to
discuss it this is an issue where they
just have presented no evidence if it's
true I'll be the first one to come out
here and say you know what I was wrong
there is evidence for it and it is true
but no when you have the DNC and you
have the Clinton campaign paying to get
dirt on Trump they pay twelve point four
million dollars and then lo and behold
they come out with a you know some
salacious information that they think
could sink the Trump campaign ain't know
what the really big giveaway is this is
the part and to be clear I think that's
leaked after the election not during the
election but the biggest giveaway is
that in the article they talk about how
internally the DNC and the Clinton
campaign they said hey nothing seems to
be working
attacking this guy it doesn't seem to be
working so whenever we bring up policy
so his hypocrisy we don't think it works
we don't think that's landing whenever
we bring up his giant character flaws
and how you know much of a loose cannon
he is that doesn't seem to be working
either he's relatively consistent in the
polls no matter what we say so how do we
tank this guy well when you when you
think you're out of options when you've
tried policy attacks you try character
attacks what's next the only thing
that's left is some sort of salacious
bombshell where you think you know it's
so beyond the pale that people will go
oh come on I can't really the P P tape
guy no can't have that so why
it's you know it's just amazing to me
because it does show you that it has
been a case of projection man and it
doesn't matter which candidate you agree
with more disagree with more putting
aside all that stuff just focusing on
this issue the Russia issue listen it's
a fact
like the uranium one deal that's been
getting a lot of press lately people are
mocking others for bringing it up
corporate Democrats are mocking people
for bringing it up you know Chris Hayes
on Twitter like we've entered the that's
the real Russia scandal face but I don't
see anybody actually rebutting it so in
other words for those who don't know we
did a long segment on this the uranium
one scandal is Hillary Clinton and Eric
Holder
were on a committee and Obama signed off
on this by the way on a deal to give
Russia control of 20% of US uranium now
as that was going on the FBI had
significant evidence that Russia was
doing bribes behind the scenes to try to
get this deal approved at the same time
the Clinton Foundation you know Bill
Clinton's going and doing a bunch of
speeches in Russia and Russia has given
a lot of money to the Clinton Foundation
so wow look at that
as Bill Clinton is getting paid off by
Russia and there's other bribery going
on behind the scenes in the US Russian
officials are doing that the committee
approves a deal to give Russia control
twenty percent of US uranium and Obama
signs off on it knowing that the FBI has
a mountain of evidence that how we got
to this place was Russia doing a lot of
bribery and there's a lot of corruption
going on
so people are mocking that as if like
you know hey it's because Democrats are
saying that Russia colluded with Trump
that now people the right is trying to
make an argument that no maybe it was
Hillary that really colluded with Russia
but again I in that story I see the
connections I see the okay that money
went to two Clinton and the Clinton
Foundation and then this committee
approved the deal where Russia gets
control of twenty percent of the uranium
in other words I see it all the way
through to fruition I see the the line
in the logic
progression in the claims against Trump
look it's not like I don't want to see
connections withdraw I just don't see it
because there's but he's done nothing
that's tangibly helped them so the idea
is oh you know Russia's on Trump's team
so a trump will of course this is the
way bribery and corruption works will do
favorable policies to Russia to help
them out ok well what would favourable
policies to Russia be well for example
one of those things would be not
attacking their close ally in Syria but
they have they bombed the the the
fighter jets in the Syrian airport
they've been constantly attacking people
on the side of the Syrian government so
that's Russia does not want that so
they're not doing what Russia wants
furthermore they increase sanctions it's
not just that we already had a
tremendous amount of sanctions on Russia
we did we had around after Crimea under
Obama then we had around after the
election under Obama then Congress
passed even more sanctions and Trump
said all right I guess I'm signing it
and he signed that and then now the
newest thing that they try to pretend
like oh he's helping Russia is that it
took an extra three weeks before they
implemented the sanctions really that's
your [ __ ] claim of how bought he is by
Russia that he delayed an even more
punitive action on them that is now
being implemented so in other words in
the case of Trump I don't see he hasn't
done anything that benefits them so I
don't I don't see how you can make the
claim that he's a puppet of them when
he's doing everything they don't want
him to do so yes I see the line in the
Hillary Clinton example I don't see the
line in the Trump example now by the way
is it possible and is it almost likely
that Trump is like laundering money for
Russian oligarchs yeah that definitely
is possible and that definitely is
likely because Trump has businesses in
12 different countries okay and it's not
like he's not corrupt of course he's
corrupt I used the example of Saudi
Arabia all the time because he
registered 12 new businesses in Saudi
Arabia during the campaign and then when
he gets elected he did a 110 billion
dollar weapons deal with them so maybe
that has something to do with the fact
that he's got close personal ties to
them yes he's in a hundred billion
dollars worth of personal debt mostly
held on Wall Street is that one of the
reasons why he's super subservient to
them and doing whatever they want yes of
course so he is corrupt and he is
corrupt with foreign governments I think
he already violated the emoluments
clause but in terms of the claim of the
Russian government him helping the
Russian government he just hasn't done
it she's sure he's helped Russian
oligarchs I'm sure that's the case
because he's helped so many rich
business people around the world and
like I said he's in business with 12
different countries help them out
another thing is they've paid exorbitant
amounts of amounts of money to his
hotels when they're here and then he
does favors for them policy wise not
Russia but other countries so yes he's
corrupt but I just don't see the line
when it comes to this specific issue of
Russia and now we know there's two
stories about Hillary Clinton and the
DNC in Russia and I see the the line all
the way through
I see the okay you guys approved the
uranium one deal and gave Russia 20% of
control of u.s. uranium I see the line
there I see the line here I see the line
of you know you wanted dirt on Russia so
you worked with the former British spy
who worked with Russian officials who
gave you information remember you guys
said hey you can't take any information
that involves foreign powers you guys
said that about Trump you guys said that
that's why there was such an outcry over
Donald Trump jr. meeting with somebody
who is Russian because you go oh you
can't take information from fart from
foreign governments and foreign people
what are you crazy that's that you can't
do that that's collusion well then by
your own definition that's good this is
collusion because this is you getting a
British spy to do opposition research to
British spy got information from Russian
officials on the so-called PP tape and
by the way you paid twelve point four
million dollars for it so again I think
they're willing to tell you whatever the
[ __ ] you want to hear so look it is a
case of projection sorry it is a case of
projection when it comes to the issue of
Russia you can cry all you want you
could say oh my god you know I disagree
with Kyle because Russia Russia Russia
but every story that's come out about
Russia on the Democratic side where
they're trying to go after
Trump and the Republicans for it they
Jun the next now it's now they've gone
all the way to the bottom and the
argument is Russia is causing us to have
arguments they're sowing discord well as
if we were so [ __ ] peaceful
beforehand like what are you kidding me
there's always been vehement rigorous
debate in the United States people don't
agree we don't agree there are
right-wingers they're left wingers of
course this is the political landscape
but now there's just Saint Bob we
wouldn't be fighting so much if it
wasn't for Russia
that's why Russia's hiring black
activists to go after Hillary Clinton
they point to YouTube channels that have
260 subscribers now they're saying
Standing Rock activists were Russian
agents are you [ __ ] kidding me
so the water protectors are Russian
agents what they're trying to do what
corporate Democrats are trying to do
kill two birds with one stone undermine
every movement to their left everybody
Sanders linked movement undermine them
while at the same time smearing the
right and trying to say hey the only
reason they're in a position of power is
because of a hostile foreign government
Russia that put them there now please
look away even though I approved a deal
where Russia got 20% of US uranium and
look away as we paid to get information
from Russia that would smear Trump
listen man I don't know how many times I
could say it all I want to do is make it
so the Democrats win again all I want to
do is make it so that we fix the country
all I want to do is make it so the
Democrats care about things that matter
Medicare for all free college living
wage ending the wars ending the drug war
new New Deal you go down the list raise
taxes on the rich that's what I'm trying
to do but when the Democrats are making
the argument Russia Russia Russia and
then it turns out information like this
comes out and it shows that they're just
doing projection and it's a hacky
argument you're making yourself look bad
I'm trying to I'm trying to stop that
and make you principled so god it's just
so pathetic
and then they'll dig their hole deeper
you know denier a tan
in the Peter dows and the [ __ ] you
know Hillary Clinton wing of the party
they'll keep digging and keep digging
and keep digging and Maxine Waters now
calling for an investigation into which
Russians were tweeting in her district
like they'll just keep digging their
hole deeper and it will make the
American people's eyes roll over in fact
I'm not gonna spoil it now but there's a
story we're getting to later in the show
poll numbers that prove my point it's
not even just that the American people
are tired of the Russia Russia Russian
nonsense Democratic voters are tired of
it so let's put it all to rest put it
all to rest and move on and focus on the
issues

KJ you're garbage now you are your host
[Music]
we'll do it live
we'll do it live look it do it live
[ __ ] thing hello everybody today we
are gathered here for a debate the
subject of this debate is very broad but
it's a debate at the very heart of
American politics liberal versus
conservative left-wing vs. right-wing
our debaters tonight represent some of
the youngest and most articulate voices
on these positions Kyle kolinsky is the
host of secular talk a YouTube channel
with over 370 thousand subscribers and
over three hundred thousand views on a
typical day he's also the co-founder of
Justice Democrats a political action
committee devoted to kicking corporate
Democrats to the curb and unifying the
Democratic Party as a social democratic
party with a progressive agenda
razörfist is the owner and operator of
the rageaholic a youtube channel with
over a hundred thousand subscribers
devoted not only to politics but also to
video games movies professional
wrestling and any other subject strikes
his fancy he's appeared on Steven
Crowder's show louder with Crowder
defended Trump's wall in a very popular
video and has long been a force forceful
and eloquent voice for the right debates
can often be the lowest form of
discourse because all too often the
concern among viewers becomes less about
which argument is better or which
position is more logically sound but
rather this who won mentality other
personality one personality triumphing
over another is not a good way to
measure ideas against one another so
I'll caution all of you watching this to
not allow yourselves to fall into this
trap look at this debate not so much as
a contest between two people but as a
platform where ideas can be compared and
contrasted in what will hopefully be a
respectful manner tonight's debate will
cover a wide range of issues Trump
gun control the wall not the Pink Floyd
album the electoral college single-payer
health care and more will be opening up
the stream labs about halfway through
for 20 minutes
so that you and our audience can also
pose questions to our debaters or just
leave us a tip to let us know that you
appreciate this discussion
but before we can debate any specifics
specific issues we have to learn some
basic definitions the words conservative
and liberal mean different things to
different people
so in order to avoid confusion I'll
start this debate off by asking Kyle for
his definition of liberalism razörfist
will then be given a chance to refute
Kyle's definition and put forth his
criticisms of liberalism razörfist will
then be given the same opportunity to
find conservatism and Kyle that so
without further ado drunken peasants is
now bringing to you what we hope will be
an interesting and poignant debate
between two people that I personally
respect hopefully they're up to the task
not only of entertaining you but
informing you and helping you see the
world from a new and interesting
perspective but they can only do that if
you the audience is willing to set aside
preconceptions set aside whether you're
a liberal or a conservative and you know
just open your mind I'd ask you to
forget about all your political
positions and remove yourself from your
own ego and simply absorb what's
transpiring in front of you this is my
recommendation to you I can't actually
make you do it so as discussed a moment
ago we're gonna begin with Kyle kolinsky
Ben you can go ahead and take me off of
a full screen at this point so we're
gonna be with Kyle kolinsky of a secular
talk Kyle are you are you ready to start
or both are you ready to start actually
sure sure let's do it ready to rock and
roll and and may I say just off the bat
it's good to make your acquaintance Kyle
nice to meet you too man don't let me
like you this early on because then I
can't argue as vociferously there you go
okay so on my mark I'm gonna be doing
i'ma be doing timekeeping duties here so
on you're gonna be given Kyle five
minutes to elucidate your personal
definition of liberalism or
progressivism or however you choose to
identify sure what it means to you and
why you think it's the correct lens
through which to view the world all
right I'm gonna also give you a warning
when you're coming up towards the end of
third
second mark I'll probably just shout out
30 seconds okay let you know that you're
coming out on your time I'd encourage
both of you to try to use as much of the
allotted time as possible if you run out
of things to say I mean that that's just
the way it is but try to use your full
time all right so with that Kyle I'm
going to yield the floor to you and that
question okay
well mark okay well I'm gonna let you
down on this one because I'm not gonna
be going on for five minutes but
nonetheless I proceed liberalism okay
well let me just say first and foremost
I'm not sure that's the best descriptor
that I would use for myself I would
choose to describe myself as populist
left or a believer in social democracy
but broadly speaking when I think of
liberalism I think of not believing in
tradition for traditions sake and
believing in progress so saying that yes
the government in many circumstances can
be used in order to try to ameliorate
social ills and bring about a better
future
unfortunately TJ you can clock me out at
one minute all right okay I'm gonna go
ahead and reset if you want razörfist
you got five minutes to respond okay
look I take not one issue with
particularly you know classic liberalism
it I find the very same cultural
permissiveness of OG liberalism makes up
the self-same rudiments of many of the
more like libertarian philosophies that
i stridently adhere to
I only bridle when that philosophy then
opted to subvert the electorate through
whether through unelected Supreme Court
justices for example or whatever or
voice itself on the citizenry through
the government's inevitable threat or
application of force like really my
opposition to modern-day liberalism
progressivism neoliberalism whatever you
want to call it can be summarized by an
willingness that I've observed in the
left to acknowledge a fundamental truth
that government is fundamentally force
and absolutely nothing else government
is not compassion government is not
large yes the government isn't money how
the government does not have a red cent
that it doesn't take from you or I all
the government has its basest essence is
the threat of force every government
program no matter how beneficial
detrimental or innocuous exists entirely
because underlying its perspective
implementation is an invisible gun press
to your temple which is why I think the
most valuable thought exercise one can
employ and I'm gonna kind of steal this
from Penn Jillette because I think he
made a good point is to ask yourself
like okay I'd like for the government to
do that but am i okay with pointing a
gun and another human being and forcing
them to do that because when you ask
that question I think it brings your
cherished beliefs under harsh
illumination and impels you to sort of
reexamine and a lot of times it may even
bring you farther to the left for
example having examined some of the more
ghoulish aspects of especially the late
term variant I find abortion utterly
repugnant on a personal moral level but
by the same token I cannot ethically
reconcile aiming a gun at another human
being and forcing them not to imbibe in
a readily available medical procedure
you know ergo I say hands off abortion
more to the point well it would be
wonderful for each of us to a man to
have medical care health insurance and a
big-tittied nurse to blow me
dawn-to-dusk
you know it ain't okay to point a gun in
someone's face and forcibly compel them
to do so and make no mistake that's the
end result if you don't pay taxes pay
your fine don't pay your fine you have
to pay your interest don't pay your
interest go to court don't go to court
bench warrant then the cops show up and
then you get to see the barrel of the
gun
charity is charity philanthropy is
philanthropy government is fundamentally
force and I've kind of wracked my brain
load these many months for many an hour
to comprehend how the same slacked of
his left that perpetuated the hands up
don't shoot fiction have any difficulty
whatsoever discerning the fact that
government is not only force but all too
elephant a an utterly unmoderated
application of it so
yeah that that would be what I have to
say on the subject of our my opposition
to modern progressivism all right so I'm
gonna open it up to a more freeform
discussion here and just you guys okay
good I want to say about that we'll
start it off with Kyle cuz I'm sure you
take issue with some of the things that
were said just now oh yes oh yes okay so
that was about four or five minutes of
denying the social contract is what you
just did
you're basically regurgitating the
talking points that 14-year olds
spew after they read a nine Rand book so
we by saying oh government is forced
that's all it really comes down to
that's a gross oversimplification and
what you're basically doing is saying
but it's all the same it's all the same
so when the government does Medicare for
example and saves the lives of people
who need health care and are over the
age of 65 when the government builds
roads and bridges when we have
firefighters and police what you're
doing is you're saying well look
ultimately at the end of the day
government equals force so all that
stuff I'm gonna lump into the same
basket and say it's it's useless or it's
not doesn't fit in my ideology or my
philosophy but what I would what I would
submit to you is literally every single
modern nation on the planet has a
government and the question is not are
we gonna have government or not is it
going to be an anarcho-capitalist
society or not the question is what size
government should we have so in other
words if you want to debate what kind of
tax rate we should have how much the
government should or shouldn't be
involved in somebody's life that's a
legitimate debate it is not at all a
legitimate debate to try to pretend like
these anarcho-capitalist talking points
are a form of valid argument where you
lump everything into the same basket and
say government equals forest therefore
let's just disregard it and pretend like
we don't need it well if you don't need
it you know what go ahead and move to
the tundra in Siberia and let me know
how that works out for you and then
before you know you'll be begging to
come back to civilized society where yes
we have government and the question is
to what extent do we have government but
here's the great irony
you argue for the social contract and
argue that when the government saves
someone's life then that's a laudable
experience but by the same token when
someone dies due to inadequate
healthcare from socialized medicine
which does happen socialized medicine
countries which are very near very
nearly happens to people in countries
with flat-out single-payer health care
systems where where they wind up with
healthcare complications due to
exorbitant wait times over healthcare
that's funny how that social contract
simply erodes and only works one way
well that what you just said is [ __ ]
that's not true I would argue further
I'm sorry what what you said is not true
so first of all every single country is
like rationing is this big thing the
people on the right like to point you oh
my god rationing health care and
single-payer systems every single
country rations care the question is how
do you ration it and how do you
prioritize it in the u.s. we do what's
called a wallet biopsy so the richer you
are the more likely you are to get good
health care in other countries they and
single payer countries they they ration
based on need so elective procedures so
yes if you want to [ __ ] chin surgery
or you want something that's elective
you might have to wait a little bit and
you know what that's totally fine
because the person who needs a
gallbladder surgery right now is gonna
get that gallbladder surgery and it's
always hilarious to me when I listen to
people like you talk about single-payer
health care and then you go and talk to
somebody who lives in a single-payer
system it's night and day they tell you
know I love our system and we think what
you do is crazy and by the way while
we're at it allow me to say that 45,000
people die every year in the US because
they don't have access to basic health
care that number in Canada and Norway
and Denmark and Iceland Sweden is zero
yeah and that's and that's invariably
what you'll fall back on but more people
have access it's true that's why I think
your thing is true providing access is
not the same thing as providing care you
know we're eating the number of people
who have access to character unless you
have a magic Harry Potter wand to
increase the number of doctors and
nurses overnight in a system that no
longer places ample incentives on
actually becoming a doctor welcome
threats all you did was give the entire
nation access to interminable wait times
I mean does it broaden coverage we
disagree the people in Canada tis
disagree the people in Norway disagree
apparently they have that magic Harry
Potter wand because they're making it
work right now and our system is not
working which which is actually not
factual because in 2013 alone in Canada
across all 12 major medical disciplines
average wait times swelled like an
improperly diagnosed neck tumour from
nearly ten weeks to eighteen and a half
weeks and I mentioned these improperly
what did I just tell you the wait times
are for elective procedures they're not
for necessary procedures they have now
and here's why I mentioned the
improperly diagnosed neck tumour because
I can I can use an example that's
actually very public and was very public
on our format YouTube prominent
philosophy youtubers stefan molyneux had
a tumor on his neck oh yes philosophy
YouTube or the very serious thinker
stefan molyneux oh please continue so
very relevant to this discussion you're
the one who mentioned they tell him they
tell him don't worry it's benign wait
three more months dude sitting near with
a shotput
in his jaw they're playing the smooth
jazz music for him over the phone and
asking him to please stand by for a
quarter of a goddamn here ten months
pass he finally gets airfare to the
states and gets it lanced off by one of
our inferior american doctors who by the
way takes one look at it says that [ __ ]
ain't benign and puts him on chemo
treatments he should have been taking in
Canada for the last year socialized
medicine quite nearly killed the dude
okay so ready that's one example you
ready for my example there's somebody
named Bob somebody named Steve somebody
named Jeff somebody named Chris somebody
named Barbara somebody named Susan there
are and this is a Harvard study I'm
quoting from youready quote 45,000
people die every year from lack of
health coverage and furthermore if you
want to talk about the Veterans
Administration suite do you want to talk
about specific cases let's talk about
specific cases there is a woman this is
under our private health insurance
system you know how people love to say
under Obamacare there are death panels
guess what they're right there are death
panels they're called private insurance
companies because what happens is they
try to find any way possible to wiggle
out of paying for your care because if
you have a private health insurance
system
you want to maximize profit as much as
possible that's the way it works you're
for profits so hey how do we make more
money deny as much care as possible
there was a woman who had skin cancer
and her insurance company said we're not
gonna pay out on your claim she's like
why this doesn't make any sense they
said well we look back into your past
and we found that you had acne she's
like what that doesn't make any sense
you're not gonna pay for my skin
treatment because I had acne they go
well you say it's acne we say it was
cancerous skin lesions and you had a
pre-existing condition so now we're not
gonna pay out and guess what she died so
you want to you want to sit here and
shoot anecdotes all day we could shoot
anecdotes all day but honestly I don't
give a [ __ ] about anecdotes because
anecdotes are anecdotes for a reason
they ignore them the macro picture and
the macro picture is from the Harvard
study not Kyle speaking here the Harvard
study quote 45,000 people die every year
from lack of health coverage in the US
that does not exist in Canada or Norway
or Sweden no matter how many shitty
little stories you come up with to try
to pretend like single-payer systems or
monstrous when they're actually
objective hold on we're gonna be able to
revisit this subject when there is a
welcome to the Corin eating candy
experience I'm going through all my
Halloween candy this is literally like
every week now it's you know you have
some sort of candy like skittles or some
[ __ ] and you show everybody it's funny
what um I started eating the lifesavers
that I have in the candy basket because
I bought the wrong kind
wait pause lifesavers the whole life
savers no they make like a gun the gummy
ones the chewy ones are good the regular
ones are just irrelevant if you're
buying life savers stop and grab
grandmas my life savers yeah yeah like I
have this butterscotch candy in my purse
and I also have some life savers
yeah well butterscotch I used to [ __ ]
with I used to like butterscotch
how about caramel nips you remember
caramel nips I remember girls caramel
nibs you just couldn't wait to bring up
women's either nips no um what are
caramel nips caramel nips well we I
don't know if I'm thinking of the right
one but there's like so there's one
thing that's like a sucking candy pause
that's caramel like caramel flavored and
then there's another one that like it's
like you eat it's like a little chewy
candy and you eat it and it's caramel
there was Werther's okay so I'm thinking
of that except it's basically the better
version of that like caramel nips are
like I don't [ __ ] with those and they
had like cream in the middle no no no
cream in the middle on the one I'm
talking about you know what I'm talking
about right with the cream on the
outside I do mom in the cream on the
inside yeah and I when you said
Werther's I definitely remember
Werther's and workers reminds me of like
the shitty version of caramel nips like
caramel nips just tastes like delicious
caramel sucking candies but the
Werther's is like it just doesn't taste
good
it just takes much to like Werther's and
Werther's was the cheap ass version of
the caramel nips the caramel nips were
the bangin ones were good man they were
good and that's some [ __ ] that was like
my mom [ __ ] I'd be like mom do you have
one of those things and she'd be like
here I'd be like this is it's crazy you
remember what the like the old-school
grandma candy was that strawberry
looking [ __ ] y'all like it looked like a
fig strawberry and had the green room on
top that she was alright though
no those were bangin yeah that would be
the only bangin one in the grandma's
old-school candy [ __ ] you know what's
super irrelevant from the grandma candy
shed is the the the ones that are like
white with the red swirls on it like the
mint one white with like peppermint yeah
I guess peppermint yeah yeah yeah I
guess that's what it would be like yeah
that's that's like nine that's like like
1908 like that just goes back it's like
that's prehistoric and who even made it
like why did anybody make that and think
like this is gonna be profitable and
this is gonna sell but I mean I guess
I'm wrong is everyone granite that's one
saying that [ __ ] was stood the test of
time like that [ __ ] is in every Fridays
and every Applebee's that that Candy's a
[ __ ] staple like yeah but it shouldn't
be it's [ __ ] up man
that thing is like there was a candy
Mount Rushmore peppermints would be on
that [ __ ] I'm going out and saying that
[ __ ] I can't agree with that that no bug
trapper minces been there since like
since like 16 like Jesus was the in
peppermints like but that's why it's so
bad like what are you also gonna put
licorice on your Mount Rushmore a candy
maybe this licorice buns though it's
buns but like it may as well have called
it like leather candy it tastes like
leather
and all the presidents on Mount Rushmore
like they were good as president it
doesn't have to be a good candy to be on
Mount Rushmore it just has to be like
some [ __ ] that would actually no that's
not a good point because they talk about
Mount Rushmore and like when they talk
about putting athletes like if there was
an athletes of Mount Rushmore mm-hmm
it's obviously the best athletes who
would you put on the Mount Rushmore
that's tough but I don't want to get off
the top the candy one because I handy
well okay so first of all on the actual
Mount Rushmore is Theodore Roosevelt
George Washington Thomas Jefferson
Abraham Lincoln
the one don't when I don't I didn't know
was Theodore Roosevelt I didn't I didn't
remember that he was on yet you know
that was that was the one who was in the
wheelchair
should know but those L know that's FDR
FDR is the one that's like look you did
or some really fucked-up [ __ ] like
Japanese internment and and lo yeah like
he did some fucked-up [ __ ] but he also
gave us the New Deal and he was so
popular and kept getting reelected that
when he died Republicans passed term
limits and said well you can cuz FDR
kept getting re-elected we didn't have
our limits back then but FDR was so
popular he kept getting reelected than
when he died the Republicans were like
we got to put it into this because if
they elect another dude like that will
never get elected so they came up with
term limits I I have a soft spot for FDR
FDR is the best in terms of economics
that the US has ever had but obviously
back then there's no excuse for it but
back then on social issues they just
weren't right yet like they were you
know like he presided over he was
president and segregation was still
happening in the south and on the one
hand you can't blame him for hat for
that existing being on the you at that
time yeah but on the other hand it's
like it still existed when he was
president you know which is like okay
that's [ __ ] up Japanese internment is
inexcusable you know so yeah so let me
ask you a question so those four
presidents that are on Mount Rushmore is
it Democratic Republican on both sides
agreed upon like yeah I [ __ ] with that
dude or like can there be a case on both
sides like I don't really [ __ ] with him
I mean you could disagree with it I want
to say yes a yes is the answer to your
question from like the layman's
perspective like yeah of course like
most people are gonna go yet Thomas
Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln George
Washington but like if you really want
to look at it critically of course you
could criticize like a [ __ ]
you know like Jefferson had raped his
slaves
that's Odie of course that's [ __ ] up
like so but anyway back to the candy one
licorice now you can't put licorice on
the cable that's what I was home so if
you bring it through different like
genres like sports if if someone was
like alright Michael Jordan's on there
Muhammad Ali's on there yeah sure like
Babe Ruth or some [ __ ] like that like
people would be like is there somebody
better than Babe Ruth there's gotta be
right or like Jackie Robinson
but is there's probably somebody better
than Jackie Robinson too in terms of
getting on there I mean maybe because
he's such a historic figure because he
was the first black player yeah
but in terms layer wise I'm sure there's
someone probably better but then again
it's not like Wheaton neither one of us
know his stats like maybe he was really
on some [ __ ] I mean if he's the one
black dude in a league full of white
dudes
you got [ __ ] like Babe Ruth
doing their little pitter-patter around
the bases yeah well yeah I mean like he
was probably way better than them just
because like black people are just more
athletic then like racist I mean like
but it's true no so it's funny because
there's a debate about this but I'm
pretty sure oh [ __ ] that was my elbow
I'm pretty sure that [ __ ] hurt yeah a
little bit I heard an interesting
explanation from it about it though by
from an expert and he's a historian and
he said that basically what happened was
so like back in the day when there were
a bunch of like Irish immigrants Italian
immigrants Jewish immigrants to the US
there was a time when like basketball
was like all Jewish or mostly Jewish and
you know if you were to stop at that
point in time and ask people they'd be
like well of course it's the Jewish
people playing basketball they're like
better at that basketball that's like
that's just who they are that's how
they're born they're just better at that
they're more physically active and just
better at that but then like it's time
went by you know basically the argument
is when people are in a more
economically tough situation one of
their few there aren't as many outs of
that situation one of the few ways to
get out of that situation is to get good
at being an athlete and so that would
explain why like black people are
disproportionately poor in the US and so
one of the ways that they get out of
that situation is to spend a lot of time
playing that sport like you know how
there's like at every in every project
around the country there's you know
basketball courts so you could spend
like your whole all your youth
and that's an opportunity to be one of
your outs to get out of poverty
basically the argument was and with
boxers it was another thing so like with
boxers now a lot of boxers are black
right hmm but back you know hundreds of
years ago when there were people you
know people were coming here from
Ireland and Italy and there were Jewish
immigrants and stuff and like they were
mostly the boxers so it was like whoever
was the economically disadvantaged group
at that time disproportionately went
into the different sports and then they
dominated the sports you know so in
other words so in other words the
argument is it's not it's not like
genetics it's not like they're just
better athletes it's that they're raised
in a situation where that's one of their
outs so more of them go down that path
and then when more of them go down that
path
more of them end up in the professional
leagues basically that makes sense I
also like not even being racist but like
some people say it's tied to like
slavery you know like that they were
doing that's why that guy what's his
name Jimmy the Greek or what is
something the Greek I fired the the
sports host who said that Jericho did a
football game oh I did not know you know
about that there's there was an
announcer I think it was in like the 80s
or maybe there early 90s there's this
announcer somebody the Greek I forget
his first name I think it is Jimmy the
Greek that sounds it might maybe I think
it might be Jimmy - great - but for some
reason it only sounds like 80% right but
anyway he was like he said that in the
middle like a football game and they
then he got he got fired because people
were like you can't [ __ ] like that's
[ __ ] racist as [ __ ] but yeah some
people think that's the case but again I
this ain't the same story and I was just
talking about I think he tried he he
gave the counter-argument to that - and
basically what he said is so like the
point that the Jimmy the Greek I was
making was like slave masters basically
bred black people and like had the
strongest black person mate with the
biggest black woman and then basically
the idea is you create bigger stronger
slaves as the generations go by and so
they could do more work for you and so
you know some people think hey that's
why the leagues are
nominated by African Americans is that
African American cities but like the
counter-argument to that is the point I
just made about how it's always just the
economically disadvantaged that end up
going into that situation but also I'm
not even sure exactly what his
counter-argument to that was but does a
lot of white people in poverty to that
like aren't you know crushing it in
basketball leagues or something like
that or well aren't you well I like MLB
how black is the MLB for example not a
lot not a lot about people in them you
know there you go if the argument is oh
they're just athletic they're just
superior athletically then they'd
probably be in that situation too but I
don't know I don't know um by the way
they named the guys that fatty is
Russell I think his name is who's this
the guy who was who was basically saying
oh you know what he said he said that
about the the slave point that when you
have them like a slave master who's
breeding you like you're not gonna be
incentivized to work harder you know
what I mean so like in other words if
you breed the bigger stronger dogs with
each other then the next dog is gonna be
bigger and stronger his point is humans
aren't dogs and if you're if you breed
slaves and then you get a bigger slave
it's not like that slave is gonna work
harder for you because a guy can still
be big and say I'm gonna work harder
yeah [ __ ] you you know what I mean yes
that was this counter-argument to that
but yeah I don't know it's weird I mean
you could see the culture like obviously
nature plays some you know amount of
influence in who goes into what field
you know LeBron James is LeBron James
for two reasons number one because he is
[ __ ] just naturally gifted like a
[ __ ] and number two because he
works his [ __ ] ass off so there's
obviously like a mix of both things
there but yeah there's like a half the
amount of like a lot of it is what kind
of a thing you're raised it like when
you look at golf is overwhelmingly
disproportionately white because you
know it's it's a sport that costs a lot
of money to be involved in so it's not
like it's an out
poor kids because you know just said a
club just cost a couple hundred bucks if
not a couple thousand bucks calling this
the same way yeah it cost like $20 to
$100 to play every time you play golf
and so that's why you see the sport is
still overwhelmingly you know there's
Vijay Singh there's Tiger Woods and
there's Harold Varner the third who are
not why of another third is definitely
even if he's black he's not black yeah
so it's interesting like how society and
cultural leads to who plays certain
sports yeah there's a lot like oh
another good point for boxing now like
you know other the Klitschkos are big in
boxing they're Russian and again the
idea was well disadvantaged put from a
lower economic class they're here
they're like okay we could fight so then
they start doing that so I don't know
it's a common greg there too um they
said he came out yes fight and all is
cherish yeah all right so it's it's
weirdness interesting anyway well okay
how do we get off the Mount Rushmore of
candy where were we on that well so I'm
trying to figure out if even if the
Candy's bad if it withstood such a long
like timeframe oh well you know like if
you do that you might have to put up
licorice and I'm not okay with that
if we can't put up licorice man like you
know what goes up there above licorice
is the old school Hershey's bar the
Hershey's chocolate bar just a plain ass
Hershey's chocolate bar because that was
so [ __ ] yeah that was some [ __ ] dudes
were probably eating in like 1906 in
fact I'm gonna look up well that cotton
candy might have to be up there too then
cotton candy but that's like barely
sandy or peanuts like peanuts are not
handy [ __ ] that [ __ ]
peanuts can be a candy to some people
well what is that a snack it's got a
fall in a category it's not a candy
that's got yeah I say like smack not
Cracker Jacks that's a snack Hershey's
founding and I'm typing in 1894 Jesus I
I nailed it I said eighteen or something
for I said somebody was eating Hershey a
Hershey's bar like a regular Hershey's
bar damn that seemed long last time in
like 1906 or some [ __ ] and yeah
1894 I'm looking at the facts on it
right now
founder Milton s Hershey everybody named
Milton back then Milton Bradley Milton
Hershey
it's funny how names go in and out of
like yeah you name someone Milton now
and that [ __ ] is getting made
fun oh yeah they're names it just like
they go in and out you know Barbara try
finding a woman named Barbara nowadays
it's impossible Asst Phyllis Phyllis
eeeh hell no there's no Phyllis Doris
Ruth Doris Margaret yeah don't exist
what about the dudes names hmm
Marie Marie there's no Marie's grandpa
my grandpa was buried there
no one's named Marie now my grandma's
name was all de al da Alda there's a
grocery store any name Aldi oh really
Aldi hey yeah Harvey or there Harvey's
Harvey Wharram Boris is like not even
American barely I was gonna say Charlie
but they're still Charlie's even though
that's old school name yeah Charlie's
around Bedwin no Edgar and Edwin yeah
those are gonzo Kyle I don't feel like
Kyle's like common you know it was
always kind of like a lower level dude
name like no Kyle will always be around
Kyle's like the Hershey kiss of [ __ ]
names
that's like John John never goes away
was Kyle in the Bible or anything like
nah Kyle's an Irish name oh really
yeah it's like you're not gay I was like
no Kyle's there Kyle could be on the
Mount Rushmore of [ __ ] names
that's like John [ __ ]
all that's gets of our context cuz we
risk because of the society we grew up
in you know like that there's a lot of
John's and [ __ ] like all those names are
like [ __ ] biblical names like
judeo-christian names John Paul Peter
yeah true that's all like good little
[ __ ]
Sarah Julia Sarah's always kind of
common that would be on the Mount
Rushmore sarah has to be on the Mount
Rushmore of names for women Jennifer you
up at at Jennifer up there right I mean
it's so common
I see Jennifer so [ __ ] common
Stephanie Stephanie's common that's so
common we're just going through names
right now we're so stupid
really man let's just say names I bet
you everybody listenings like why the
[ __ ] are you guys just saying names
right now there should be a Mount
Rushmore for everything Bay way yo the
sports one that was a good point you
brought up you said Muhammad Ali he's
definitely going on yeah and then there
was Jordan Jordan is definitely going on
but then you get into an argument of
like okay but what about Bill Russell
you know you could say well believe it
was easier back then but then at the
same time he won like 11 rings yeah so
it's like well what do you he wants so
many more than Michael like how many
would he have had two one for us to say
he goes up there over Michael you know I
mean okay you have to win 18 before
we're like you know what put Bill
Russell instead of Michael it's true and
we're also yeah a product of like yeah
Michael Jordan's error of course yeah
but it just goes to show you that you
put Bill Russell like an
african-american dude in that whole
Jewish league and he's just [ __ ]
demolished everybody he did [ __ ]
everybody up man that's like I'm trying
to think like if you put like a
Dominican dude in a dance contest like
back in 1950 with like all white people
that dude like people would be like what
this dude is doing some [ __ ] that out
like how does his body move like that
well I think the first reaction is this
everybody just gets dismissive so like
Democratic donor Tom Steyer launched a
campaign to try and impeach Trump so
this guy's a billionaire Democratic
donor and I want to take a look at the
video here and then we'll come back and
discuss he's brought us to the brink of
nuclear war obstructed justice at the
FBI and in direct violation of the
Constitution has taken money from
foreign governments and threatened to
shut down news organizations that report
the truth if that isn't a case for
impeaching and removing a dangerous
president then what is our government
become I'm Tom Styer unlike you I'm a
citizen who knows it's up to us to do
something
it's why I'm funding this effort to
raise our voices together and demand
that elected officials take a stand on
impeachment a Republican Congress wants
impeach the president for far less yet
today people in Congress and his own
administration know that this president
is a clear and present danger who's
mentally unstable and armed with nuclear
weapons and they do nothing
join us and tell your member of Congress
that they have a moral responsibility to
stop doing what's political and start
doing what's right our country depends
on it ok so everybody who's familiar
with the show knows that I've done
segments about potential Trump
impeachment for a while now and I always
had a little bit of a contrarian take
where as mainstream Democrats and people
who are part of hashtag the resistance I
think are pretty short-sighted and they
make bad arguments for impeachment and
then also I think there's almost no
thought that goes into the fact that
pence is almost exactly as bad as Trump
is so to me it seems like you're
spending a lot of political capital to
get nothing accomplished so okay you get
rid of Trump and then you get pens and
pencils all most equally a disaster so
you just wasted all this political
capital and you have nothing to show for
it because if
anything pence can get a draconian
agenda through and he doesn't get the
same kind of media attention because
he's not doing bombastic mean tweets so
Trump does the bombastic mean tweets
gets the ire of the media and fails at
getting through that draconian agenda by
and large whereas pence I think would be
more effective at doing it and he has
better relationship with Republican
Congress people and senators and he can
spin his in a way that you know
the media would would go down more
easily so that was that was my take on
impeachment for a long time now I've
I've moved from being against it to just
being confused and agnostic because
there is one key issue now that I think
is such a big issue that impeachment
should be on the table and that issue of
course is the fact that we might we
might literally go to war with North
Korea now that's not hyperbole in fact I
have a story later on in the show today
coming that talks about it's so serious
that in the government there are
whispers now where people are told hey
if you have any assets in South Korea
get them out so people in the government
top administration officials are
whispering to their friends look I'm
just gonna tell you right now any assets
you have in South Korea get them out
because this is the closest we've ever
been people really don't have any idea
as to how bad it is and now the the u.s.
is preparing to put nuclear bombers back
on 24-hour alert like there's a lot of
creepy going on and it looks like
Trump is just I mean I don't know what's
holding him back actually I I I might
know what's holding him back there was
another report that said mattis is the
only one in the administration that's
saying whoa whoa whoa pump your brakes
let's not necessarily go to war yet so
it might just be only Madison the
administration and everybody else is
saying let's do what are we waiting for
let's attack North Korea so being that
that's
the case even though I think pence is a
war hawk he is even though I think he's
in neocon he is I don't know if pence
would have his finger on the button in
the same way that Donald Trump would
have his finger on the button when it
comes to North Korea and pence is not as
impulsive as Donald Trump is when it
comes to North Korea so yeah now it
appears to me that all things being
equal and understanding that pence might
even get through a more draconian agenda
through Congress and be more successful
at it that one issue is just it's
lingering and it's an issue that should
really keep you awake at night that
nobody's driving the ship and it is like
all the chest puffing you see on
Twitter and every every other day Trump
is threatening to attack North Korea
only one thing will work only there's
just like you only one thing will work
all the presidents have failed in North
Korea only one thing will work we've
tried for a while did it they haven't
listened only one thing will work well
what's that one thing he means war so
since that's the case man it's hard to
just sit by idly while you know a
president is letting you know that
they'll concoct some story and
do another offensive war and then what
happens when you do an offensive war
against North Korea I mean a bunch of
idiots on the far right and neo-cons who
might support this might think what
would you mean with just to beat them
and that's it no you launched on North
Korea North Korea immediately launches
on South Korea and Seoul hundreds of
thousands if not millions of people are
in danger in South Korea
not only that but they might have the
ability to reach a US territories like
Guam is another one so given that that's
the reality of it and given the Trump
appears to not really give a that's
a scary thing man an impeachment might
might be a legitimate option you know
now in terms of what issues you use
exactly to do it well that's where it
becomes a little more murky and one of
the things I don't like about
all the Democratic campaigns to try to
impeach Trump is that they it's almost
like they take a smorgasbord of reasons
and they just vaguely throw them at you
but like if you're gonna actually do
impeachment you can't just say hey
here's like four or five reasons that
kind of sort of maybe where he can maybe
be impeached you have to pick one and
actually get facts on those issues
actually get evidence to prove your case
and then bring it so in other words you
can't like he did in this thing like a
mentally unstable that's not it that's
not enough you can't just say I in my
opinion he's mentally unstable because
what the does that mean that any
Democratic president a Republican you
can say we think they're mentally
unstable and it's just like that
doesn't that's not a standard of proof
that makes sense
so you have to come correct if you're
gonna do this so I don't even think you
can necessarily use the issue of North
Korea as the you know the tool to
impeach even though that would be the
main driving reason in my mind behind
why you maybe should do it I think the
thing that you have the the best chance
of getting him on if they were to go
down this path is we're now a permanent
war state so according to the
Constitution the US the Congress needs
to approve war they need to approve war
and what's happened
post 9/11 in the era of the war on
terror is that we have sent troops
virtually everywhere and we do it under
the guise of oh don't worry it's okay
because that authorization for the use
of military force that was passed under
bush applies now even though many of the
places where we've sent troops are not
even going after al-qaeda like al-qaeda
was the original oh we have to get
terrorists terrorists meaning al Qaeda
cuz they attacked us on 9/11
well then al Qaeda kind of branched down
there like well also I guess the Taliban
cuz the Taliban is in is in Afghanistan
and then they've kind of shrugged and
went well I mean I guess we could just
add Isis onto that list without getting
a new authorization for use of military
force because Isis was a branch of al
Qaeda that broke off from al Qaeda so
it's still technically
under it but then they just keep it okay
al-shabaab okay Boko Haram okay any
 group that we don't like we say
you know what close enough we got the
authorization for use of military force
and they don't even care that we're now
in Iraq Afghanistan Syria Pakistan Yemen
Somalia Libya like all these different
countries it's not like we have an
authorization for the use of military
force for each one of those countries
which is what you would have to do under
the Constitution so what you could do is
you could say what the Donald
Trump's got troops every way he's got
troops everywhere we got him in
Niger the are they doing in Niger
that's what one just got killed there
and that's there's this big scandal
about how he's treating the the widow
and the Congress person who was there
for the phone call when he called this
poor woman who lost a loved one but I
mean the real scandal is what the
are we doing there what are we doing
there we just kind of like everybody's
axe I guess we're there what do you mean
we're there that's not the are we just
that you know far down the stream of
where an empire like it whatever
we are it's okay doesn't matter what the
 we are it's fine it's totally fine
we could be anywhere we want we're in
 the Congo Papua New Guinea who
gives a I'm gonna question it
doesn't even the media is not even
saying what our well to be fair there
are some people and we're gonna get to
that story a little bit later but
there's only question I've seen we have
this giant media apparatus in the u.s.
I've only seen one question of what are
we doing there so you can say hey you
don't have the ability Congress did not
approve military actions in all these
places so on that we're gonna impeach
you but guess what in order to use that
as your argument you're also indicted
Obama for example you know every
president well every president post bush
meaning Bush Obama and Trump I mean
that's what they do they say we could
just go anywhere we want because the war
on terror bro like that's their argument
so if you do that then what you're doing
is you that's a precedent I agree with
by the way to say hey you need to get
Congress to approve you to go to this
place in this place in this
place if you're so inclined to go there
but then you have to be objective and
stick to that standard and the next time
there's a Democratic president and they
try to continue you know the war on
terror and our empire and have troops
everywhere you need to say
now we're gonna impeach you and they're
not gonna do that and you know they're
not gonna do that because everybody
wants to sleep under Obama when he like
my thing for sleep sleep sleep because
he was doing the same in terms of
sending our troops everywhere and very
few people even batted an eyelash so ok
whatever we're in seven different places
it is what it is know that if not not it
is what it is that is an impeachable
offense because you did not go through
Congress as you're supposed to under the
Constitution for those things another
thing you could do you could say hey
he's Oh still he's president as the NSA
is still spying on everybody
unconstitutionally I mean we're talking
about something that is clearly a
violation of your protection from
unreasonable search and seizure a
violation of your right to privacy and
that still exists under Trump we got to
get rid of it but again then that's an
argument you should have also used
against Obama for impeach but then you
didn't but I think the one of the main
ones that there really is an ironclad
case is yes the emoluments clause
because that I mean Trump yes he's a
businessman
yes he's his own products are made in
like twelve different countries he does
business with twelve different countries
at least and there is a mountain of
evidence of corruption where you have
foreign governments giving him money
hoping to get favors in return I mean
just one example Trump opened up twelve
new businesses in Saudi Arabia during
the campaign and then lo and behold look
at that he approves a gigantic weapons
deal with Saudi Arabia now that he's
president furthermore Saudi Arabia and
Qatar they've they've paid trumps hotels
a ridiculous amount of money way more
than they actually spent when they
stayed in those hosts at those hotels
because they're using that as an avenue
where they say what do you mean no we're
just paying for the hotel but they're
really legal bribes so again Trump can
approve the weapons deal too
so that's a foreign government giving
him money through one of his businesses
under the guise of hey this is
legitimate business it's a legitimate
business it's a foreign
government paying you money and then you
turn around and you do favors for them
using US policy and giving them giant
weapons deals so and those go on and on
by the way there's a thousand examples
of Trump whether it's from South Korea
or Turkey or you name it favors being
done because of corruption
so he's pay to play corruption all day
long not just with corporations which of
course with that too but with foreign
governments and that violates the
embodiments Clause of the Constitution
so you can build a serious case based on
that but again point has to be made if
it was Hillary Clinton in office she
also violated the emoluments Clause from
 day one and nobody would have
been in favor on the Democratic side of
impeaching Hillary over violation of the
emoluments clause which she most
certainly did with the Clinton
Foundation and them taking money from
foreign governments and then doing
favors for those foreign governments so
but look at this point I'm curious to
see what you guys think because I used
to be on the side of you're just wasting
your time and wasting political capital
if you're trying to impeach Trump
because pence is gonna be just as bad as
he is
and he's probably gonna be even more
successful at getting these horrible
policies through so I wouldn't even
bother wasting time and effort spending
political capital for that reason when
you're supposed to save up your
political capital so that you know you
go after you can go for policies that
matter Medicare for all free college
living wage you can pressure the
out of the Republicans and said they
want to blow it on something like
impeachment when you're gonna get the
same kind of guy in office at the end of
it anyway so what's the point but now
because of the North Korea situation and
the fact that I literally believe
there's now over a 65% chance we're
gonna offensively attack North Korea now
because of that I think I don't know man
might we might have to by any means
necessary kind of you might have to
get this guy out of office so I don't
know man but then again there's also the
outside chance that pence would be just
a standoff
North Korea I mean I don't think that's
the case because you get the sense that
a lot of the escalation from Trump is
due to literally his personality and the
fact that he's so impulsive and that
when you know North Korea the North
Korean dictator Kim Jong hoon does the
we will rain fire down on America and
 whereas Obama blew it off and was
like okay because that guy's a
 net he's you know he's not gonna
offensively attack us that's a
ridiculous idea
that's something Obama knew that's
something Bill Clinton knew that's an
you know Trump I don't know if he knows
it or doesn't know it but I do know that
when he hears that he views that as like
a threat to his masculinity and a threat
to his fragile ass ego so then he fires
back like we will ray and fire and fury
down on you so it's a tin-pot dictator
talking to Trump and Trump in turn
reacts like a tin-pot dictator and yes
we're on the brink of war so if
that's the case and I think it is then
yeah maybe the peach mints necessary so
I don't know curious to see what you
guys think but I just want everybody to
understand how dangerous the threat
really is because we really are on the
brink of war and wolf a war with North
Korea would be a crime it would simply
be a crime
so President Bush got a lot of credit
yesterday because he gave a speech and
he went after Trump without even saying
his name so democratic Twitter lost it
and started saying things like he's our
ally and he's reasonable and he's on our
side now and oh this is so brave and so
courageous we're gonna watch a good
chunk of his speech here and then I want
to come back and talk about it but what
people focused on in the speech the
people who praised it were a few little
comments that he made here and there
that yes we're going after Trump without
mentioning his name but what's amazing
to me is I watched the entire speech
about 16 or 17 minutes and it's all of
george w bush's old beliefs sprinkled in
with like saying hey white supremacy is
bad and people lost their over it
and we're giving him fawning heaping
praise so let's watch it and i'm gonna
give you the full context this is about
a four or five-minute clip here but
you're gonna get the full context of
what he really said in the speech and
then we'll come back and discuss we have
seen insolvency economic stagnation
youth unemployment anger about
immigration resurgent ethno-nationalism
and deep questions about the meaning and
durability of the European Union America
is not immune from these trends in
recent decades public confidence in our
institutions has declined our governing
class has often been paralyzed in the
face of obvious and pressing needs the
American dream of upward mobility seems
out of reach for some who feel left
behind in a changing economy discontent
deepened and sharpened partisan
conflicts bigotry seems emboldened our
politics seems more vulnerable to
conspiracy theories and outright
fabrication we've seen our discourse
degraded by casual cruelty
at times it could seem like the forces
pulling us apart are stronger than the
forces binding us together argument
turns too easily into animosity
disagreement escalates into
dehumanization too often we judge other
groups by their worst examples while
judging ourselves by our best intentions
for getting the image of God we should
see in each other we've seen nationalism
distorted into nativism forgotten the
dynamism that immigration is always
brought to America we see a fading
confidence in the value of free markets
and international trade forgetting that
conflict instability and poverty
following the wake of protectionism
we've seen the return of isolationist
sentiments forgetting that American
security is directly threatened by the
chaos and despair of distant places
where threats such as terrorism
infectious disease criminal gangs and
drug trafficking tend to emerge first
America must harden its own defenses our
country must show resolve and resilience
in the face of external attacks on our
democracy and that begins with
confronting a new era of cyber threats
America has experienced a sustained
attempt by a hostile power to feed and
exploit our country's divisions
according to our intelligence services
the Russian government has made a
project of turning Americans against
each other this effort is broad systemic
and stealthy it's conducted across a
range of social media platforms
ultimately this assault won't succeed
but foreign aggressions including cyber
attacks disinformation and financial
influence should never be downplayed or
tolerated it's a clear case where the
strength of our democracy begins at home
we must secure our electoral
infrastructure and protect our electoral
system from subversion the second
category recommendations concerns the
projection of American leadership
maintaining America's role in sustaining
and defending an international order
rooted in freedom and free markets our
security and prosperity are only found
in wise sustained global engagement in
the cultivation of new markets for
American goods we become the heirs of
Martin Luther King jr. by recognizing
one another not by the color of their
skin but by the content of their
character this means that people of
every race religion ethnicity can be
fully and equally American it means that
bigotry or white supremacy in any form
is blasphemy against the American creed
[Applause]
bullying and Prejudice in our public
life sets a national tone provides
permission for cruelty and bigotry and
compromises the moral education of
children the only way to pass along
Civic values is to first live up to them
so there you have it you can see the
parts where many Democrats started
coming on themselves and going oh yes he
says bigotry is bad and he says white
supremacy his bed came out against
bullying Oh feels so good
he went after Trump hero courageous
bravery now understand am i downplaying
the fact that he said those things no I
think it's good I think it's good when
anybody says specifically hey here are
the evils I'm referring to and these
things need to stop so anybody making
that point is welcome to make that point
the problem with this speech is
everything else that came hand-in-hand
with it because everything else that
came hand-in-hand with it it's the
reason we got Trump so let's go through
some of the points he makes he starts by
mentioning well nowadays our politics is
vulnerable to conspiracies quote can
and outright fabrication whereas when
you were president that wasn't the case
you literally pushed falsehoods that got
us into war with a country that didn't
attack us
you said Saddam was responsible for 9/11
turns out he wasn't turns out he wasn't
working with Osama bin Laden then you
said he had weapons of mass destruction
turns out he didn't and now you're gonna
go up there and have the nerve to say
our politics is vulnerable to
conspiracies and outright fabrication
and you're directing that at Trump now
is it true that politics under Trump is
vulnerable to conspiracies and outright
fabrications of course he's buddy-buddy
with Alex Jones he lies about all
the time
non-stop but so did you and you lied us
into an offensive war against the
country that didn't attack us the UN
said this is an illegal war you cannot
do it you did it anyway
minimum 200,000 people died in Iraq
minimum 200,000 civilians we're still
there today you started the war on
terror that got rid of due process that
got rid habeas corpus you did indefinite
detention Guantanamo Bay is still open
you opened it up there's the NSA and the
Patriot Act which is now responsible for
totally obliterating the Constitution
you don't have a protection from
unreasonable search and seizure anymore
are you kidding me they're spying on
everything you do we live in a
surveillance state and you are gonna go
up there and you have the nerve to talk
about conspiracies and outright
fabrication when your administration's
biggest failure was based on that then
he goes on to talk about bullying uh you
know we got to be against bullying and
bigotry remember when you in the
campaign floated the rumor that John
McCain fathered quote an illegitimate
black baby so they did this thing called
push polling in the south where they
would call people the bush
the Bush campaign will call people in
the in the Carolinas and talk about it
and ask this question would you be more
likely or less likely to vote for John
McCain if you found out he fathered an
illegitimate black child the idea was to
smear McCain using racism and bullying
to try to get elected how quickly people
forget the bar for reasonable and
courageous has to be more than this
person doesn't agree with Trump cuz
Democrats are at the point now where if
Charles Manson utters a bad word about
Trump they'll go see even Charles Manson
I don't give a what Charles Manson
says I don't give a what George
Bush says he is a war criminal if one
war criminal doesn't like another war
criminal that doesn't mean the other war
criminal is suddenly good then and
here's the part where okay he says the
argument he's making is okay okay let's
stop the bigotry and stop the white
supremacy Wow
so bald George so bald that's like the
lowest bar ever of course no bigotry no
whites privacy of cars oh my god how the
 do people fall for this but
then he goes on to talk about how
oh and now there's a rising tide against
free trade and there's a rising tide of
isolationism which is the pejorative
term by the way for non-interventionism
so in other words he's smearing the idea
of us not going to offensive wars and
having nine hundred military bases
around the world that costs a hundred
billion dollars a year to maintain as
our infrastructure crumbles
he's smearing that he's saying oh
there's a rising tide of an anti
free-trade sentiment people want to do
protectionism Oh protectionism so bad
you know what that means right what he's
saying is hey I still love NAFTA even
though it brought it absolutely crushed
the American middle class I'm in favor
of the TPP that's what this means I'm in
favor of continuing to outsource good
American jobs I mean I'm in favor of
continuing to crush American
manufacturing that's what all that means
when he talked about ah you know there's
a rising tide of anti-free trade
sentiment and isolationism and so in
other words same old George Bush same
old George Bush
let's keep outsourcing American jobs
let's keep doing foreign wars let's keep
the Empire going and then of course he
has to slip in a healthy dose of
Russia's bad Russia undermining us
attacking us I mean what are we gonna do
let me ask you what do you want to do
George what do you want to do is the
same thing I always ask anybody who buys
in and goes right down that we the slide
of the Russian conspiracy with them you
know they used Pokemon go to sway the
election they got black youtubers that
had two hundred and sixty subscribers to
say mean things about Hillary so what's
your solution George what's your
solution we already have sanctions on
Russia out the wazoo
countless sanctions on them what's the
only next step what's the next step what
is there left to do do you want another
war is that what you want is that what
you want I'm asking you I don't know I'm
asking you because we've already
sanctioned them out so then what's left
I don't know let's keep our Russia
divided us right because we weren't
 divided before you know Russia
get spent a couple hundred thousand
dollars in facebook ads and somehow
fahren money all God that in that
affects our election and it makes it so
that people are beholden to the foreign
governments but when Goldman Sachs
spends money in our system and when Wall
Street does it and when the big banks
don't know that no no that's totally
fine that's totally reasonable mean my
Republican buddies in the corporate
Democrats we're totally cool don't look
this way when we do the bidding of oil
companies and big farm and health
insurance companies in Wall Street but
Russia Russia has spent a couple hundred
thousand dollars whereas Wall
Street spends millions if not billions
of dollars don't look at that Russia
Russia Russia Russia's corrupt our
democracy listen the argument he's
trying to make and this is why this is
so infuriating is that Trump is
an aberration he's the problem and if we
just get rid of Trump everything is fine
so in other words go right back to the
shitty place we were in before Trump and
everything's fine
wrong George everything is fine for you
everything is not fine for the minimum
200,000 Iraqis you killed everything is
not fine for the people who got
Orchard everything's NOT fine for the
middle class who got obliterated
everything's NOT fine for the economy
when there was a subprime mortgage
crisis in a Great Recession everything's
NOT fine for our infrastructure which
had a great of d-plus everything is not
fine for outsourcing everybody's job
everything's NOT fine for the half of
Americans who make $30,000 a year or
less but the argument he's making is
Trump is a cancer get rid of Trump
everything's fine I'll accept Mitt
Romney as president I'll accept Jeb Bush
or Marco Rubio or Hillary Clinton as
long as we keep the status quo going
everything's fine well no that's not
true
Trump is an absolute horror and a
monster and so is the
establishment but you want to use the
argument the Trump is bad to prop up the
establishment and every argument you're
making here proves that he even went as
far as to say we need to maintain
America's role in defending order around
the world and freedom and free markets
that is nothing but an outright argument
for continued American Empire these guys
are not mad at Trump because he does
stuff like drone strikes that Massacre
civilians approves raids that kill
civilians these guys aren't mad at Trump
for deregulating the wall street even
more and signing preposterous executive
orders that are gonna taint the economy
screw over people these guys aren't mad
at Adam at Trump for getting rid of
Obamacare through executive orders and
driving a stake through its heart
they're not mad at Trump for that
they're mad at Trump because he's not
politely continuing the American Empire
they're mad at Trump because sometimes
he says some protectionist stuff even
though don't worry he's not actually
protectionist Jorge which is something
you'll love he's still trying to slip
provisions of the TPP into his
renegotiation of NAFTA but the fact that
you have a former president who was a
horrendous president going out there and
still talking about the US needs to
defend freedom and free markets defend
freedom that
we have to do Jorge like we did under
your administration as you gave the
Saudi King smooth hand jobs walking in
the Rose Garden
so we prop up theocracies and
dictatorships but you have the nerve to
say the US needs to continue to defend
freedom but we weren't defending freedom
in the first place where we defending
are we defending freedom for the
Palestinians when you give weapons to to
Israel is that what we're doing when we
are on the side of continued illegal
occupation and settlements and apartheid
is that what we're doing
[Music]
there's nothing brave about this there's
nothing Courageous about this yes white
supremacy is bad wow what a hero
thank you George
thank you but everything else it's the
same old george w bush
let's outsource more jobs let's
deregulate more free markets let's
continue the American Empire let's do
more offensive Wars
let's escalate further with Russia
another nuclear nation pure hakham to
listen to that and think oh man he's so
good now he's part of the resistance
this next article that I want cover with
you is New York Times becoming a parody
of itself
this is limousine elite liberalism 101
the Democrats are at their weakest point
since the 1920s they can't afford to
spurn Wall Street I wasn't kidding when
I said there's like a parrot New York
Times being a parody of itself imagine
thinking that by the way Douglas Schon
writes this article and shocker he
worked in the Clinton administration Wow
Democrats are at their weakest point
since the 1920s they can't afford to
spurn Wall Street have you considered
that maybe they're at their weakest
point because they haven't spurned Wall
Street okay let's try to keep our calm
as we go through some of this piece many
of the most prominent voices in the
Democratic Party led by Bernie Sanders
are advocating wealth redistribution
through higher taxes and Medicare for
all and demonizing banks and Wall Street
pause perhaps that's why he is literally
the most popular politician in America
but I digress memories and politics are
short but those policies are vastly
different from the program of the
party's traditional center-left
coalition under Bill Clinton that
coalition balanced the budget
acknowledged the limits of government
and protected the essential programs
that make up the social safety net
President Clinton did this in part by
moving the party away from a reflexive
anti-wall street posture it's not
popular to say so today but there are
still compelling reasons Democrats
should strengthen ties to Wall Street as
the party has left behind that version
of liberalism it has also found its way
to its weakest electoral position
nationally and at the state level since
the 1920s Hillary Clinton's lurched to
the left
probably cost her Midwestern states that
Barack Obama had won twice and led to
the election of Donald Trump okay pause
I [ __ ] told you so I told you they
were gonna do this Hillary Clinton runs
a corporatist centrist sellout
establishment campaign she gets beaten
by Donald Trump and their conclusion was
it wasn't corporate or centrist /
right-wing enough it needed to be more
in favor of the status quo
you don't want Donald Trump bludgeoned
Hillary over the head with the fact that
she gave those speeches to Goldman Sachs
remember that according to this jackass
the problem was she wasn't close enough
to Goldman Sachs
she wasn't close enough to Wall Street
she didn't give enough you know $600,000
speeches or $300,000 speeches or
whatever they were that's the problem
according to this guy and notice how he
fudged the facts I'm gonna read this one
more time he says as the parties left
behind that version of liberalism Bill
Clinton's version and has also found its
way to its weakest electoral position Oh
nonsense it's been with that ideology
that they're now at the weakest position
this guy acts like Bernie Sanders was
the last democratic president who was
elected and that it was under Bernie
Sanders that we had the loss of a
thousand Democratic seats
it wasn't Bernie Sanders it was Obama it
was President Obama guess who lost a
trump it wasn't Bernie Sanders it was
Hillary Clinton so your version of
liberalism you're a democratic party
that you want is the one that already
exists and it's been wiped out from
coast to coast and you're fudging the
fact and saying oh it's these goddamn
populist leftist who believe in Medicare
for all and whatnot well if that's so
unpopular why is it pullet [ __ ] 60%
and why do even more Republicans support
it than don't support it I don't know if
he's lying or if he's just the world's
biggest idiot but let's continue
Democrats should keep ties with Wall
Street for several reasons the
first is an ugly fact of politics money
maintaining ties to Wall Street makes
economic sense for Democrats and keeps
their coffers full in the 2016 election
the Center for Responsive for responsive
politics reports employee employees and
companies in the securities and
investment industry donated more than 63
million dollars to the Democratic Party
pause again that's the problem
he's not making connections when they're
right in front of him hey Democrats
raised a shitload of money from Wall
Street oh my god they lost well I guess
the problem is they didn't raise enough
from Wall Street no the problem is they
raise money from Wall Street it's one of
the biggest problems and then to bring
it up like this is the problem with neo
liberals and corporatists they never
question the framework of the system if
something already exists we must
rationalize it and work within that
context no this is why Bernie Sanders is
the most popular politician in the
country he dares to question the
fundamental underpinnings of the way our
society works and he goes this could be
[ __ ] so when he says a money is just
a fact of life what are you gonna do man
this is what our politics is run on it's
an ugly fact so he calls it an ugly fact
so presumably he's saying man isn't it
[ __ ] up the money seems to run our
politics but then he goes on to say well
I guess we got to give in to that and
try to sell out more no the answer is
let's try to get money out of the system
let's try to get clean elections and
before you give me that [ __ ] tripe
of oh no it's you know it's just that'll
never happen that's exactly what people
said about women getting the right to
vote before they had the right to vote
that's exactly what people said about
ending segregation in the south before
we ended segregation in the south so
spare me your ignorant possible
arguments because that's been made a
thousand times before and every time
it's been wrong with enough pressure and
enough of a movement behind it of course
we can get it accomplished and by the
way that is the answer to get our
politicians to be more accountable to us
and not to be accountable to
corporations and Wall Street is to get
the money out of the system and have
clean elections by law for the 2020
election some of the parties strongest
potential presidential candidates
senators Cory Booker Kirsten Gillibrand
and Kamala Harris as well as Duval
Patrick the former Massachusetts
governor should not be
dismissed simply because of their
current or past Wall Street ties if
voters really hated ties to Wall Street
and financial elites Republicans would
not enjoy such a commanding electoral
position or have elected a New York
plutocrat president most voters major
problems with President Trump stem from
his performance not from his wealth or
connections to Wall Street pause again
he's deliberately fudging the facts one
of the main reasons Donald Trump won is
he portrayed himself as more
anti-establishment and more anti status
quo than Hillary Clinton
remember how everybody's he's kind of
populist because he was kind of populist
when he's railing against TPP and he's
railing against NAFTA as he did he's
railing against outsourcing jobs as he
did when he says I'm gonna rebuild our
infrastructure why are we wasting all
this money overseas in these wars as he
did those are populist positions so in
other words how many times did he say in
the campaign I'm so financing my
campaign I'm so now by the way that's
not true he didn't actually do that but
when he argued that people heard that
and they go oh [ __ ] maybe he's not
beholden to the billionaires maybe he's
not beholden to the elites so that's one
of the main reasons Trump won if the
establishment GOP that really was open
about his close ties to Wall Street was
popular perhaps Mitt Romney would have
won but he didn't and he didn't because
it was too obvious
whereas Donald Trump did run a populist
campaign even though that was just a
veneer and he's selling out like
nobody's business
but that was one of the main reasons why
he won and notice I'm he's like well the
Republicans are you know they're winning
so obviously you can't be Wall Street
ties can't be the big the big thing
notice man Republicans run is
unapologetic Republicans Democrats run
as a Republican light when you give the
American people the option of Republican
or Republican light they always choose
Republican but when you give them the
option of a Republican or a populist
leftist the populist leftist wins and
also this guy's on you know he's not
giving enough credit to just how much
Republicans lie so you know yes a
Republican who in an election
talks about how he's gonna cut
middle-class taxes and so I want you to
keep more of your money the Democrats
don't that's a lie that he's saying that
but that's a message that can [ __ ]
win it resonates it's that's also a
version of fake populism so maybe
Republicans win when they talk about
that stuff and not when they go out
there and brag and say I'm super
connected to Wall Street Donald Trump
did not do that and that's one of the
main reasons why he won a second reason
Democrats should keep ties to Wall
Street despite what the Democratic Left
says America is a center-right
pro-capitalist nation a January Gallup
poll found that moderates and
conservatives make up almost 70% of the
country while only 25% of voters
identify as liberal even in May 2016
when senator Sanders made redistribution
a central part of his platform Gallup
found that only 35% of Americans had a
positive image of socialism compared
with 60% positive of capitalism okay
herein lies the biggest lie of this
piece now let me again be fair and say I
don't know if he's lying or if he's just
super ignorant or if he's an idiot
but what does his poll say here
his poll is about what labels so you
talk somebody and you've all experienced
this I've experienced this you talk
somebody with yeah you know I'm a I'm a
center-right kind of guy a moderate a
moderate I'm kind of conservative I'm a
centrist um so yes when you pull the
American people and you ask them about
labels it turns out that at the moment
being a centrist or being moderately
conservative it turns out that that's
more in vogue and people would label
themselves as that but guess what what
he doesn't tell you is people who
describe themselves as conservative who
voted in the Democratic primary in the
Midwest overwhelmingly voted for Bernie
Sanders what so it turns out people
don't know dick about labels and they
call themselves conservatives but when
they listen to Bernie Sanders rail
against Wall Street and rail against the
elites and talk about medicare-for-all
and talk about free college
and talk about raising taxes on the rich
they go I agree with all that so hold on
you describe yourself as conservative
but you agree with all Bernie Sanders
proposals that exists in the world and
it exists in the u.s. in large numbers
in large numbers
furthermore this could be on purpose
that he's using the more obscure polls
the vague pulse that reference labels
without showing that the American people
have any [ __ ] clue what the labels
are guess what when you go to the
specific policy issues which is what
really matters here 60% of the American
people 61% actually want a Medicare for
All system even more Republicans want it
then don't 58 percent of the american
people want free college Wow
80 percent of the American people want
to raise the minimum wage only 17
percent of the American people still
want to be in Afghanistan and that was
as of you know 2013 or something so
we're years beyond that numbers probably
like [ __ ] 10% now of the American
people that say okay sure let's stay in
Afghanistan 58 percent of the American
people want to legalize marijuana you go
down the list the American people if you
go by the issues they are unquestionably
populist left not a doubt about it but
he cites the vague misleading obscure
poll that subsets with [ __ ] labels
which is the lowest form of discourse
you can really have how would you
describe yourself I'm a nice guy that's
what I am uh eighty-nine percent of men
describe themselves as nice men what the
[ __ ] does that mean doesn't mean
anything are you actually nicer are you
not same thing with this
I'm not moderately conservative I do
love Medicare for all in free college
and a living wage and all these things
are populist left but I'm definitely
conservative it doesn't mean anything
so we citing these numbers that don't
mean anything when you go issue for
issue the American people are populist
left and he does not address that fact
okay and finally he says this was
evident to Democrats in the 1990s from
1996 to 2000 for example Democrats led
the way on two key economic legislative
victories first the Telecommunications
Act of nineteen
six deregulated the the communications
and cable industries increased growth
and enhanced market competition second
the financial services Modernization Act
of 1999 removed regulations placed on
financial institutions by bureaucrats
and expanded opportunities for Wall
Street to engage in mergers and
acquisitions adding wealth to the
retirement accounts and other investment
portfolios of millions of middle-class
Americans [ __ ] if the party is going
to have any chance of returning to its
position of influence and appeal
Democrats need to work with Wall Street
to push policies to create jobs heal
divisions and stimulate the American
economy this is like again remember I
introduced this story by saying the New
York Times is The New York Times being a
parody of itself with their limousine
liberalism look at what he's championing
as democratic accomplishments these are
some of the biggest Democratic failures
in modern history the Telecommunications
Act that deregulated the communications
and cable industry that's what led to
the consolidation that we have like
[ __ ] five mega corporations that
control the narrative in mainstream
media everybody hates the mainstream
media and they hate the mainstream media
because there's a consolidation of power
you have wealthy elites hiring people
that push their narrow worldview and
he's bragging about this say remember
when Bill Clinton did that man what a
success it was to deregulate the cable
industry and make it so that wealthy
elites control more of the narrative
he's bragging about that and then he
goes on the financial services
Modernization Act of 1999 you know that
is massive gigantic tremendous
deregulation which in part led to the
Great Recession in 2008 and and is
continuing to lead to the bubble that
we're in right now because we never
recovered from all the mass deregulation
going back from Reagan Reagan Bill
Clinton George W Bush Obama to an extent
to but mostly Reagan Clinton and W Bush
do you regulated the [ __ ] out of the
American economy and ever since then
what have we had giant boom-bust cycles
there was a period when glass-steagall
was implemented you know after the or
during the Great Depression what
happened we had a steady financial
system and steady banking slow but
consistent growth second you got rid of
those regulations I mean you had giant
boom bust cycles over and over and over
we're still going through them now it's
because of deregulation like this and
he's bragging about it and he's saying
well this wasn't it great when the
Democrats did these things that crash
the economy and ruin people we've had a
slow decline of the middle class in
America for the past 40 or 50 years and
this guy saying let's go back to the
good old days in the 1990s when Bill
Clinton was continuing that war on the
middle class and by the way most of the
good things that happen under the
Clinton ministration you can credit to
the tech boom oh we had a balanced
budget yeah cuz there was a giant tech
boom so this guy he's got no clue the
[ __ ] he's talking about he's ignorant or
he's a liar and if the Democrats go down
this path as they're poised to do they
will get obliterated which is why
justice Democrats is the answer where
the Bernie wing where the populist wing
of the Democratic Party no corporate
money no PAC money no [ __ ] ties to
Wall Street justice Democrats calm slash
fight
Bernie Sanders and Ted Cruz had a debate
last night where they spoke about the
Donald Trump slash Republican tax plan
that they're now in the process of
crafting the details and attempting to
pass and Bernie answered a question from
a trump supporter in the audience and
this is a special clip in my opinion
because Bernie breaks it down in his
answer and then it appears like he
breaks this poor man's brain senator
Sanders
over my lifetime all we've seen is more
government and more expenses cutting
taxes from top to bottom or bottom to
top however you view it then we'll give
some relief to the burdensome expenses
all Americans face why would you not
want a tax cut across the board for all
Americans well I do want a tax cut for
the middle class and working families
but when the top one-tenth of 1% now
owns as much wealth as the bottom 90%
when you have a handful of people with
incredible wealth and power no I'm
afraid that I will not support tax
breaks the billionaire's know I don't
know if you were there when President
trouble you there when President Trump
came to Pennsylvania I was yeah
and President Trump was touting as I
understand that the repeal of the estate
tax something that senator Cruz supports
that's why he was there correct let's
talk about the repeal of the estate tax
the only people who benefit from that
are the top two-tenths of one percent
ninety nine point eight percent of the
people who would not pay a nickel in
estate taxes senator Cruz will tell you
about all the farmers and the ranches
well Ted there are 80 of them in the
United States the overwhelming majority
of beneficiaries of this estate tax the
Trump was supporting our people like the
walton family do you really believe that
the wealthiest family in America should
get a tax break of up to fifty billion
dollars that the Koch brothers should
get a tax break of up to thirty billion
do you think that makes sense I did say
all Americans
well do you think that the wealthy
should not get tax breaks I did say all
Americans okay well I happen not to
believe that the Koch brothers need a
tax break oh that was embarrassing I was
hard to watch and Bernie's face at the
end says it all because he built he made
this ironclad argument basically you
know painting a picture and an accurate
one at that that lets this guy know
listen if you don't agree with me on the
next point you will expose yourself as
the world's biggest rube you will be
chump number one in front of the eyes of
the nation millions of people watching
this right now and then he explains okay
so what the Republicans do is they use
this idea and they'll they'll say it but
they're lying tax cuts for the middle
class and the poor they'll say that but
then when you look at the details of
their play and they're really talking
about cutting taxes for the rich and
then he says what do you want like the
walton family to get what do you say
like another fifty billion dollars and
by the way some of the taxes that we're
talking about cutting here and in one
case eliminating the estate tax yes it
would give the richest people in the
country billions more dollars billions
more dollars so we're talking about
people who are already so rich they have
no clue what to do with all their money
they're so rich that the amount of
wealth that they have literally
threatens the stability of governments
that's how [ __ ] rich they are when
you're a multi billionaire you have the
ability to purchase elections that's
what this is we live in at oleg Archy so
he says you know these people already
billionaires you are gonna support tax
cut to give them billions of dollars you
think that they deserve billions more
dollars and then by the way another
point Bernie didn't bring this up at
this point of the debate but he brought
it up at a different point in the debate
and even one of the questioners brought
it up they said hold on ted cruz i
thought that you were one you know
you're big on hard work pull yourself up
by your bootstraps
so then why on earth are you not for the
estate tax because this just creates
more paris hilton's this just makes it
so that if grandpapa did all the work he
can pass on bill
of untaxed dollars to the spoiled brat
kid who's never done anything so then
every argument you've ever made against
welfare for example shut the [ __ ] up
because you're undermining that argument
you say aw come on we can't give these
poor people enough money to get food for
their kids and to pay the light bill
gross are you kidding me we can't give
people an extra couple hundred dollars a
month that makes them lazy but somehow
giving spoiled brat kids multi-billions
of dollars doesn't make them lazy and
you're in favor of that it's almost like
Ted Cruz is doing the bidding of his
donors it's almost like it's more about
being a puppet to corporations so Bernie
goes down the list and he says is that
what you want you want to give billions
of dollars more to people who are
already billionaires I did I did say all
Americans and then Bernie paused and you
saw his face like [ __ ] he's like really
so you think people who are billionaires
you want to give them more billions of
dollars I did I did say cut taxes for
all Americans you know what Sam he could
have said anything there Bernie could
have said anything
he said let's he get a state of the
actual fact not just for the US but for
the world I think most of these people
live in the u.s. though the richest
eight people I think it is or six people
I forget if it's six or eight they have
more wealth than the bottom 50% of the
world combined
so like eight people more than like 3.5
billion people combined so Bernie could
have said oh you want to give everybody
a tax cut you want to give the people
who have more than half the world
combined more money do they need that
that's what they need they need more
money when [ __ ] Flint Michigan
doesn't even have clean water our
infrastructure gets a grade of D we got
45,000 people dying every year because
they don't have access to basic health
care you want to give them more money
billions dollars more money
he what he was said he would have said
the same thing because he broke his
brain
it's his brain is just like malfunction
cannot think Bernie making logical
points cannot rebut just restate thesis
I did I did say cut tax for everybody
Bernie could have said if if one person
had all the money in the world and
everybody else had nothing you really
want to cut taxes for that one person
who has all the money in the world
they'd say I did say all people that is
what I said god damn it
stupid liberals can't even understand
that when somebody's got all the money
in the world they deserve more of all
the money in the world and everybody
else else can kick rocks kick rocks the
thing is anything instead of saying or
phrase anyway that's just disheartening
because that's a guy who's just drunk on
fox news where it doesn't matter what
logical point you make he's made he's
his mind he's made up his mind as me it
doesn't matter what you say that's it
doesn't matter what you say that's one
of the guys who doesn't matter if a
republican was running on a platform of
I will rape your grandmother he'd say
goddamn liberals don't even understand
that raping a grand mom can be a noble
thing
god damn liberals so there are people
who are too far gone that guy's one of
them just so everybody knows and I also
love the because it's it means nothing
when they say this [ __ ] like when he
started off as his question he's like
senator Sanders we've had more
government and more regulations more
taxes what does that mean we've we've
had more government and more regulation
and more taxes okay so which taxes are
you referring to go ahead go ahead buddy
you tell what taxes are you refer we've
had more taxes was that mean we've had
what got what regulations are you
talking about
we've had more government what does that
mean what does that mean please tell me
what specific things are you referring
to cuz they just say [ __ ] they just say
[ __ ] in their own bubble it's like I
think this does this make sense doesn't
even matter if it make sense I'm just
gonna say and you saw Bernie's face then
- he's like [ __ ] is this talking about
like I feel bad for the guy because he
has no idea that Bernie's policies would
help him a lot more but then the other
part he doesn't feel bad for the guy
because there are people who once you
explain it to them and they they sit
down they'll go man that does kind of
make sense like when Bernie was in the
room with all the Trump voters in West
Virginia he argued for Medicare for all
and free College in a living wage and a
room full of Trump voters in West
Virginia gave him a standing ovation so
those people are examples of Republicans
who are not beyond help these those are
people who voted for Trump because they
thought he'd be more anti-establishment
than Hillary Clinton and he thought they
thought Trump would fight the trade
deals to keep their jobs in the US
that's why those people voted for Trump
this is a guy who voted for drums just
because Trump's the Republican and I
vote for the Republicans no matter what
under any circumstance I don't even care
about the details of the facts that's it
I'm just gonna vote for Republicans
because that's what I do I just vote for
Republicans
so you know Bernie you tried man you
tried and also again and this was a
theme throughout the debate I
unfortunately don't think Bernie stress
this point enough because he needs to in
order to really make the Democrats case
ironclad but every time Bernie said
actually yeah I'm totally fine with
cutting middle-class taxes and taxes for
poor people Ted Cruz would then strawman
Bernie and say no you want to raise
taxes for everybody and Bernie would say
no you know I want to cut taxes for
middle-class people and poor people but
he didn't stress that point enough and I
feel like that's what one of the only
arguments that Republicans have to
pretend and they are pretending because
they don't actually do it like they're
the the party of the little guy the
average Joe I've experienced that myself
firsthand or I talk to people who vote
Republican and they genuinely believe
that Republicans are the part of your
working people and I'm like
flabbergasted like what on earth makes
you say that and that's the only point
they have they say well you know
Republicans want me to keep more of my
money Democrats don't probably's want to
raise my taxes
Republicans want to lower my taxes
Democrats want to raise my taxes now
again that is factually not true not
true at all when you look at the tax
proposals from Democrats and Republicans
going back decades now it is 100% of the
time the case that the Democrat would
cut taxes more for the bottom 90% of
Americans and then depending on which
Democrat you talk about some of them
would raise taxes for the top 10% some
of them raise taxes for the top 5% some
of them raise taxes for the top 1% okay
but for 90% of the American people under
every Democratic proposal your taxes get
cut more and inevitably and invariably
everybody who says the Democrats want to
raise my taxes are people who are part
of that bottom 90% who would benefit
from Democrats tax plans and the
Republicans all they've done is
marketing 101 that's it so they've
marketed themselves as we are the party
of tax cuts we are the party of tax cuts
we're the party of tax cuts and Ted Cruz
said multiple times in that debate hey I
want to cut your taxes I want to cut the
middle class taxes and Bernie did an ok
job but he didn't really hammer the
point home enough that what Ted is
saying is not accurate based on the plan
so he's saying to you you I am using
words coming out of my mouth to tell you
that I'm in favor of middle-class tax
cuts but when you actually go to what is
written on paper and what they want to
become law that is not true in fact they
net raise taxes on middle-class and poor
people one of the ways they do that is
they lessen the number of brackets from
like seven brackets I think to three so
the bottom bracket goes from like 10% to
12% that's an increase of 2% for the
bottom [ __ ] bracket that's raising
taxes on the middle class on the poor
and they get rid of the salt deduction
for example which makes it so that you
can deduct your state and local taxes in
certain states they say no we're gonna
get rid of that which is a net tax
increase on about 30% of the middle
class so you know Bernie they good job
but oftentimes what happens is and look
he's guilty this I'm guilty of this too
sometimes because it's a hard thing when
Ted Cruz is spewing you know countless
[ __ ] every
minute like every minute there's like
eight lies and what he's saying it's
hard to keep up with all of it but he
didn't do as good of a job rebutting the
specific points of Ted Cruz he just when
they went to Bernie oftentimes in the
debate he would go to almost like his
stump speech on the problem okay here's
the 1% has the money and all that stuff
which is all true but you know I would
like it if there was a direct rebuttal
of all Ted Cruz's points because Ted
Cruz kept stressing I want to cut
middle-class taxes even though that's
not true the plan does not cut
middle-class taxes and he kept straw
Manning burning and saying you want to
raise people's taxes and every now and
then Bernie would say no I want to cut
taxes for middle-class and poor people
but it wasn't enough to really get it
through the minds of a lot of people and
I mean I think the main point is they're
presenting such different pictures of
reality it's just it just becomes a
matter of who you trust more if
somebody's already inclined to trust Ted
Cruz more than Bernie Sanders and
there's no way that they're gonna leave
that debate thinking Bernie Sanders won
because they already think Ted Cruz's a
straight shooter even though he's not
Bernie Sanders when you actually [ __ ]
fact check of course Bernie's telling
the truth about everything and Ted Cruz
is making [ __ ] up but a lot of people go
into it with their confirmation bias so
they'll leave going yeah Ted Cruz won so
that was an interesting clip nonetheless
you have Bernie Sanders really breaking
that guy's brain because he makes a good
point the guy that doesn't know how to
compute it he's like oh yeah I'll say I
said cut everybody's taxes but he's like
really you want to get fifty billion
dollars more to the Walton family when
six of them have more money than the
bottom 50% of Americans combined think
about that
six people have more wealth than half of
Americans combined do you want to give
them billions of dollars more he's I got
yet could cut taxes he thinks in bumper
stickers Bernie broke that guy's brain
Halla everybody I'm just showing him get
taken off the court right now in a
stretcher me and corn are watching
opening night for the NBA and was his
name's Brandon Hayward right Gordon
Gordon Hayward yeah okay well that guy
just got his [ __ ] rocked OD and first
off no one should name their son Gordon
my friend texted me and told me it
looked like Sid Vicious back in the day
in WWF when he snapped his leg jumping
off the top rope trying to like kick I
remember that yeah his leg was like it
turned into the [ __ ] spaghetti dude
it was just yeah it was right disgusting
is that what happened here looked
exactly like that it was bad man but
he's face on the court was like they
have um there's an account
do you know barstool I do yeah so I
follow them on Instagram and they were
like we're not going to show you what
happened but like they they did the
video right above Gordon and like just
the reaction of the Cavs bench this [ __ ]
just like cleared people were just like
oh like everybody's face was like ah and
what happened I heard LeBron was
involved in the play right no no I think
I didn't really see the play I sort of
um just watched the injury which was
weird
um I think he went up for an alley-oop
or something and just came down from
like high off the ground like it just
landed bad and his leg just went in
every which direction
could you imagine waiting all season
excited to get out there and then that
happens
I can't ma'am it's it was bad do it like
it's just like and like I can't watch
that squirmy [ __ ] like that like I don't
mind it but something about that I can't
watch it
it seems so fake that for me I almost
could I watched it because it's it
doesn't seem real like I'm looking at it
like alright no one's like supposed to
look like that so I can I can I'm
looking at it I can't do it I can't
watch it I could stomach it maybe in a
movie where I know it's fake but in real
life no I can't see it I know but to me
it's just it like it is real it's really
really really like is OD broken yeah but
it's just gonna you think
no no never broken Issei that's why I
have well and you just know the feeling
of like that so when you look at
something and it's out of place you're
like oh in a way I almost feel like it's
it's better to to break your [ __ ] like
that and have it heal then like tear
your ACL and MCL and all that stuff well
I don't know apparently that's one of
the worse to get over right if you like
an Achilles or torn Achilles well yeah
torn but like a break if it's a clean
break it can it can heal better than
like some some tear or something like
that or yeah a muscle tear is harder to
you than a bone snap or whatever like
they say when you sprain your ankle
really bad it's almost it almost would
be better if you broke her ankle cuz
like the spraining is just it's just
lingering around forever and ever I
didn't know that but that does that's
crazy I mean there's no science behind
that oh I thought there I thought there
was science behind maybe like the torn
like a ligament or something is really
hard to like they have to go in and
surgically repair something doesn't heal
itself
mm-hmm like I know with a bone you you
set it you put the casts on it and it'll
heal
yeah but I don't think that's some
things need to be surgically repaired
they can't like they don't heal on their
own yeah I mean I don't know what it is
I don't know if it's a ligament or
something like that but people have had
like knee injuries and like Achilles
injuries and [ __ ] and like you need to
like and like back injuries act like
fuse plates together and [ __ ] yeah back
surgery I heard is the worst yeah cuz
it's hard to recover from it people yeah
all you everybody knows like the old man
with the bad back like that's a [ __ ]
every there's so many of them yeah just
dudes real like yeah hurt my back in 89
and [ __ ] you know ever since then
they just it just doesn't look the same
or feel the same but all the like strain
we put on her back now like when we when
I'm shoveling the driveway or something
like that and I'm fine it just like
picking up mad snow and then just like
throwing it off to the side like I think
of like my dad who's got a bad back now
[ __ ]
yeah but like when he was my age he was
probably beats in that [ __ ] too yeah
it's just
age man your body just like slowly falls
apart it's just crazy songs to think
that like I can do all that now and it's
like I'll shovel my
driveway and layman are gonna be reading
and you can't not even a tea but like
year 65 or something just like in a lot
of pain because all of the [ __ ]
shoveling I did when I was younger
this is weighing on me now I always
think a trump when we talk about these
things because says he's 71 and
overweight and he's still like limping
around I mean for 71 like he doesn't
look like old old I said the same thing
I don't think he looks like he's 71 but
I think a lot of that has to do with
number one actually the orange color of
his face everybody makes fun of it but
like that makes it look like radiant
like it makes him look more alive there
are yeah you look more health like it
was like a vibrant color yeah so people
are let's be healthy or whatever and
then the hair the the the blonde hair
that's an old white man trick when you
hit a certain age and your shoes are
definitely gonna be white and you can't
keep dying at Brown because it'll look
too fake you die alike like blonde and
you're like what do you mean like you
know like and people will look at it at
first glance from a far away it'll be
like is this is hair white or is it
there's a blonde then you get closer
like oh it's blonde and he just doesn't
look horrible because I mean his hair
looks horrible night I don't think this
is a color thing I think cuz of the
[ __ ] way it's well there was a black
again someone did a segment on it one
time that like there was a there was
some special hair treatment something
that was like station to floor below I'm
in the Trump Towers that they thought he
was getting like these hair plug
treatments or something like that cuz
like it was some illegal [ __ ] that the
guy was doing and like it was like
stringing hair together and and somehow
like Trump's hair looks exactly like
what the guy was doing and he was like
in his building
did you see during the campaign when he
like had a woman on stage and he was
like pull my hair go ahead feel it
doesn't feel bad right it feels because
he knows like people make fun of it or
someone Jimmy Fallon did that corny ass
oh god and that pictures going down a
history of like him laughing with Trump
and pulling his [ __ ] hair but I want
to get back to the injuries what's the
worst injury you ever had um I'd
probably just say like a like a bad
sprained ankle
really that's yeah he man you're lucky
you escaped childhood without you
weren't an accident-prone kid I guess I
was accident-prone kid but most people
have spoke
into happy but I don't really do crazy
[ __ ] like it no but you play sports yeah
that's all it takes right there I'll
give you a few examples I'll give you a
few stories of people who we know who
and I could say I won't say the last
name but one of them's Andrew a kid
Andrew you probably the first one you
think of is the one that I'm talking
about I'm thinking of like Andrew
Jackson though he went to high school
after the genocide he went to art school
and he was like hey guys so anyway that
that kid he was on our soccer our soccer
team when I was a kid and he was a beast
and he was like the number one scorer on
the team and there's one day when he was
we were going to like practice or a game
or something and he went to go shut the
door he was grabbing something out of
the car and then he shut the door with
one hand and his other hand was still in
the car
and he just broke his hand she was like
oh you were there for it I was there
when it happened but they just
immediately rushed him to the hospital
oh my god yeah
it was [ __ ] creme burr that and he
had a cast on I remember him having a
cast song for a while and then the
things that happened to me I think I've
told some of these stories before on the
podcast but I'll tell you again our
friend my friend Mike and your friend
Mike when me and him were kids we were
like best friends and we would hang out
all the time and we used to play hockey
like in my basement we would like run
around and [ __ ] shoot little hockey
ball roller hockey ball around in the
basement and he he took the stick back
on one point and just I don't know if it
was my writer or I or my left eye they
did a good job doing the the stitches
cuz you can't even see it now you could
barely see it now but hit the corner of
the stick hit my eye hit the side of my
eye and let the huge gash and then they
had to do stitches and the doctor said
if it was like an inch closer to my eye
that I would be like blind in one eye
it would imagine you have to go through
your whole life with a patch on your eye
or with the [ __ ] fake eye yeah what
your whole life would be so different Oh
totally is even though like you'd be the
same person people would just be like
that dude as a glass eye yeah I don't
know I don't know if I'd be the same
person because I feel like you probably
wouldn't be as confident um yeah I feel
but I feel like I'm I'm very I'm
perceptive of how people are perceiving
me like I can tap into what I think
you're thinking in a social situation
and if I get the feeling that like I'm
putting people off simply by me being
there
I just won't want to be anywhere else
really you know what you guys are kind
of right like you know and I'd feel like
you said I'd lose a lot of confidence
and and all that stuff I would just be
totally different that's a good trait to
have that that sense of like when you're
having a conversation worse man some
really curse yeah and I'll give you it's
funny you mention X I was gonna tell the
story today on the podcast anyway that
relates to this so somebody had to come
and take care like you know whatever the
heater the AC for me and just to get it
like prep for the winter or whatever and
to do I know the dude he's a nice
student stuff but he's like a big-time
Republican like I could tell from little
things he had said here and there
whatever and he knows what I do but he's
never checked it out so he doesn't know
like everything I think or whatever so
what extent yeah yeah but like I always
in a situation like that since I just
want it to be over like let's get it
over with whatever you you know you got
to take care of you do your thing
here's the money we're done here you
know like I just don't I don't want to
make it I don't want to argue I don't
want anything weird to have it sounds
like air-conditioned prostitutes and
then he sucked my dick numb kid so
anyway he started like talking a little
bit at one point about something
political and I just tried it like I
hate feeling in any way like a sellout
or like I'm betraying myself or my
values and stuff yeah but like I just
wanted the [ __ ] exchange to end so he
was like he's like yeah NFL huh
I'm like yeah yeah NFL man who's your
team he's like I don't even really watch
yeah I'm like I'm like yeah I don't I
don't either man and he's like yeah yeah
but you know now I won't even watch even
more like if I turn off I flip through
it on the station I won't even stay
there for three seconds I'll go as fast
as I can so that I don't count as a
viewer for their thing and I was like oh
yeah yeah man I hear you
and then I was like referring to it
negatively because of like Ealing [ __ ]
because of the problem and I wasn't
about to be like well you know what man
that's like free expression and what
they're doing is they're protesting
police brutality and whether or not you
agree with them this is America and they
have a right to yada yada ya I wasn't
gonna get into I want to get into it so
I was just like yeah yeah yeah and if
there were like four or five different
things like that they were like he would
sprinkle it into the conversation and
you know like we were talking he we were
talking about I think Harvey Weinstein
and then he was like you know yeah
Hollywood's exposed you know like all
these people who were big-time antitrump
and then you see that they were doing
like sexist you know sexual assault and
stuff and I was like oh yeah man like
the first thing that popped in my mind
when he said that was I wanted to be
like Bill O'Reilly Roger Ailes [ __ ]
every man on fox news like who are you
kidding
Donald Trump himself like you're saying
anti Trump Donald Trump himself grab him
by the [ __ ] I don't even wait but I was
like you know I don't want to deal with
it I don't want to deal with it so I was
just like yeah yeah anyway I was like
change the topic and stuff and but
anyway my point is that's I hate I
almost end times like that I hate that
quality that I have where I'm perceptive
to what other people think of me
because at a time like that if I didn't
have that I would just be like nah man
no like Kaepernick's right next question
you know what I mean yeah but then that
leads to a fight or like that's my point
and I wanted to get whatever I wanted to
get it over with like okay look you're
here to do X Y & Z uh you know I am a
paying customer here let's go through
this boom boom we're done here
like I wanted it to be over but still
somebody who was less perceptive who had
a lower ability to sense how others are
thinking or feeling emotionally they
would just be like they might have been
like nigh disagree and then still kind
of kept it moving you know what I mean
yeah I guess it's more so on that guy
for not picking up the cues it's like
hey this like this guy doesn't want to
talk to me let me just do my job and get
the [ __ ] out of here yeah it's not that
anyone I talked to him I didn't want to
talk about that [ __ ] oh you know like I
didn't want to talk about that [ __ ]
don't give me don't ya that's not get
into politics you know
especially when he's gonna I'm gonna
disagree with him on everything like I
remember he had to do do a job when like
right I think it was a day or two after
Trump gave his speech to the RNC and he
was like would you think of Trump speech
and I'm like I was like well it was
different
yeah I said something like that right
something like that you can't assign a
thing to it and he's like he's like I
think it was one of the best speeches
ever given by any president ever change
man and you you wonder like how does
Trump helping that [ __ ] guy you know
like he's not yeah he's probably losing
his health insurance because of Trump
but he's just [ __ ] worships him yeah
there's no way that he is actually
helping that guy he's probably hurting
him in so many ways by the way that I'm
mad at myself today because I was trying
to keep with our tradition and have my
sour gummy worms before I came on air
yeah but I was like I was full and then
I was like I'm not gonna do it let me
just not do it because I don't feel
better I won't eat that [ __ ] and I'll
feel better later and then as the time
got closer and closer to us doing the
podcast I saw on Twitter somebody like I
thought it was like a sign man I don't
believe in that [ __ ] at all but somebody
had tweeted a picture like gummy worms
or gummy bears and I was like oh you
[ __ ] so I was like that's it
that's my sign to go do it but then I
looked at the clock and the spot right
near me was closed and I was like oh so
you sort of wanted them more yeah
exactly so last minute I was like well
this is terrible because I was like
picturing sitting here talking to you
chewing on a gun a gummy worm every now
and then that's why I got these joints
right here skis they're not my favorite
I know I know but this is what we have
in our Halloween basket whatever's there
you're probably in so many [ __ ] Kit
Kats and Reese's and [ __ ] skittles
edge we can't come soon enough because
I'm going through like the whole [ __ ]
like Bowl my wife got mad at me she's
like I listened to the podcast last week
and like you were chewing your candy and
it was so disgusting like I'm sorry if
I'm doing that pisses people off out
there
thank you today she she texts me on my
drive home we usually get a we usually
get home around the same time she was
like I'm stopped to the gas station and
I can't my car's not starting when I was
like five minutes away the gas stations
like two minutes from my house I was
like I'll be right there thinking like I
don't know what the [ __ ] I'm gonna do
like I don't know how to fix that [ __ ]
and Satan to your point I had first
assumed it was like her battery and then
like some commercial came on my car like
as that was happening was like like
phone battery or something like said the
word battery and I was like it's deaf
yeah remember the other day when I said
to you like I want Wendy's and then you
just text me a picture of a bag of
Wendy's and you had just eaten Wendy's
house that [ __ ] and I was like that's
another sign but then I didn't get into
Wendy's no I asked I was like what are
you gonna do you're like nothing I'm too
lazy to move man I'm not getting that
even though I want it badly so son I go
to the gas station my weight off your
story my bad no she's parked at the
putting air in her tire cuz she hurt one
of her tires gets low and she was like I
pushed this like button which it usually
is to start the car and usually turns
green and it's orange so I looked down
at her shifter and she's in Drive but
the car is all so that's why it wasn't
starting so like she'd been waiting for
like him or and I was just like put it
in park Oh
[Music]
remember from that's so funny remember
from back in the day I would I would be
driving and our friend Jimmy would just
throw the [ __ ] neutral without me
knowing and then I'd be like well it's
not working the car's not working I
don't understand it needs like he'd
laugh and then you put it back in Drive
and I'm like you [ __ ] [ __ ] don't
do that [ __ ] yo sometimes when you're
like calm the other day so I have a
Wrangler in it in a like when you're in
Drive you can pop it over to like that
Tektronix [ __ ] or whatever you know what
I'm talking about
semi automatics I mean yeah well yeah I
have that too sure and and I I ought it
like I accidentally hit it into that
thing and I didn't know what the [ __ ] to
do like I'm trying to go fast and it
wasn't going yeah like I
moved it down and it brought me into
gear one and I was like pushing the
thing and it wasn't letting me push it
back into drive and I was like on the
main highway so I was shook for a little
bit so I would kept just [ __ ] with it
and eventually it got back into Josh oh
hello everybody um Kyle and Koren here
uh Koren just took 30 minute nap before
the show I like how he told me earlier
he's gonna work out and then you know
son I'm about to have some of these as
my performance enhancer so maybe in like
20 minutes that might be sugar going
yeah I just had it's now become a
tradition I didn't want it to become one
but it became one now I have sour gummy
worms every day of our podcast like
right before our podcast that's not a
bad idea yeah I sort of have some type
of junk food or something last week I
think I had like six beers I liked how
we were talking about how we're dieting
like six episodes ago and then it just
slowly kind of tapered off and now I'm
like so anyway gummy worms and you're
like so I pounded six beers and I'm
gonna have skittles so I'm always tell
me I work because um they have well
first I have all this little candy now
because we went Halloween candy shopping
that's what I'm saying so I went outside
and my neighbor was like oh like you
know first Halloween cuz we have a house
now sorry from chewing and talking don't
give a [ __ ]
um so he was like it you know the
neighborhood's pretty popular a lot of
kids come around and do Halloween
Chisinau so I told my wife I was like we
should get in the spirit like we should
put some [ __ ] on our house and like get
some candy and like do it up you know
like we're an actual legit family people
yeah like we're humans yeah like we're
normal like I don't want to be that
house that you know always on Halloween
yeah you remember those houses that's me
yeah the shit's shut off it doesn't look
like I'm anywhere like I disappear yeah
and as a kid you know exact but that
stays with you for like for ages like
because even when I'm older and I'll be
driving like through my cuz my parents
lived in her apartment complex and you
know they like the apartment buildings
were the mean people are at ya and there
was one house that was in our apartment
complex it was so random it was just a
random house mhm that like I guess they
owned that property before the apartment
complex was built and they were like
we assumed that they were evil like it
could be the nicest lady in there just
like I don't want to put [ __ ] on my
house for Halloween but even growing up
to this day we're just like that's that
house like yeah you were scarred and so
now you're like [ __ ] you I'm gonna I'm
definitely gonna have that [ __ ] well you
know like the houses that we're dark you
know you remember the houses that gave
you like [ __ ] pennies or gave you
like once or twice like if your yeah and
you're opening your door on Halloween
you gotta know that giving out pennies
is just like what I like it when people
put out the thing but everybody abused
it if you do that if you put out the
thing everyone else everyone like people
are somewhat reasonable we're like
they'll take like they'll take more than
it says to take like usually they leave
a sign like please take one or something
and then people take like four and
that's still like they're not taking the
whole [ __ ] but they're taking just
enough where it'll run out quick enough
where you're like I'm not even gonna do
that yeah my mom used to be that person
she would put the basket out and I'll be
like mom you know people just come by
and just take the whole thing and then
we don't have any can't you know like my
mom's good my mom opened the door and be
like hey I'm I think I poured some your
mom gave me candy like when I walked in
the house like she was like oh hold on
and like went around the corner and got
like a basket that she was handing out
and like brought it to me inside the
house and I was just like that's what's
up like you're into it like that's
awesome yeah I don't know why I remember
that but I think that was Halloween I
was at your house one time that's got it
gots gotta be and it's gotta be
old-school like from when we were young
young
no not even I think it was when you were
in your crib and um like it wasn't
fairly that long ago and I remember
walking in and it was Halloween I think
and that's like she's giving out candy
on another day get you the basket shell
I think she'll like comment on all the
little kids like outfits and stuff like
a near Batman and you're a pirate and
you're it's like you know classic he's
like classic person who opens your door
on Halloween classic nice lady [ __ ] does
she throw anything on for
she might I mean she might do like um
you know whatever little [ __ ] angel
thing or whatever mask or whatever just
at work cuz I think it worked at her job
they get into it but outside of that I
don't think you remember you remember
well I don't know I used to do this but
I would always dress up some holidays I
would get into it I think I was like an
M&M one year or like do something that
was an actual costume but then other
years I would go trick-or-treating was
just like a jersey on or some ship yeah
sort of when I was older I guess yeah
and you leave it to the people who went
to their door like that's not a costume
we're not giving you candy and you're
just like [ __ ] you [ __ ] I went out of my
way to bring on your doorbell and you're
gonna be like a costume policeman oh
that's funny
by the way the weather here is still
like summer so I don't know what yours
is like right now but it doesn't hate
you
it doesn't feel like it's October I feel
like our weather here it's weird it's so
weird because I see this in with sports
games now too if it's like 85 and sunny
here in a in about two days New York
gets the same exact weather so like so
today it was like a little colder and a
little rainy and then like in two days
like me go be like mmm it's like super
sunny in two days always see everyone I
know from New York like oh it's like a
summer day we're going to this I'm like
I had that already two days ago I used
to hate the change of seasons now I like
it
cuz I'm I really want to I get tired of
like 80 90 degree weather it get just
gets too hot and now I want like 55 60
and it usually is that temperature at
this time of year but it just hasn't
been recently which is kind of annoying
so it doesn't feel like it's Halloween
like we're talking about Halloween
because Halloween's right around the
corner but it doesn't feel like it's hot
it's about to be Halloween yeah well
that's like um I think we've had a
couple Christmases where it's like a
little like warmer well yeah I was just
saying how I let me ask you what your
perception of it was because my
perception of it was maybe there were
only two years or three years of my life
that it didn't snow at least a little
bit at one point or and
in New York in the winter mm-hmm like I
feel like it's only been two or three
times in my life where it just didn't
snow all winter and then there are other
times where it snowed like a little bit
and then there are other times where it
was like a blizzard or two you know like
what's your perception of it do you
remember times when there it didn't snow
all winter in New York I think it snowed
more times than it didn't snow that yeah
I memories not that good where I'm sort
of just like yeah it's always just been
cold and snowy for you know like
Christmas or something like that you
know yeah it's all most most of the time
I think I looked it up one day it was
like on average I'm not gonna know I'm
not even gonna try to give a number but
it was like on average we get a certain
amount of snow per year but that it's
not as much as like you would think
mm-hmm so it's like sometimes we just
don't get snow like I remember one year
me and my dad it was when I was like
early on in college but me and my dad
like would play golf all winter it was
like [ __ ] 35 degrees out there we're
playing golf because there's no snow on
the ground and we were like the only
people on the course but it was just
cold as hell it was cold as [ __ ] but you
bundle up and you're fine yeah yeah you
know but yes well I always think about
the people I don't I think I was in
California one year for Christmas I mean
I was just like it was hot as [ __ ] and I
was like this is this is weird
yeah like this doesn't feel like a
holiday like that I used to think I like
the Oh gimme 72 not seven excuse me give
me like eighty degrees every day but as
I got older now I don't like the heat as
much and I prefer like 65 degrees maybe
70 degrees man yeah not that I don't
like I don't mind having a degree
weather or like and all that stuff but
choose me when I've known that my whole
life
oh yeah bull there's supposed to be a
little brick when you're going cheap
you're treating like you just become
accustomed to all these like weathers
for these signature holidays that when I
was in California and it was like 80 90
degrees or maybe it was Florida or
something like that and I was just like
this doesn't feel like this just doesn't
feel like Christmas like yeah or you
know not like it just felt strange to me
you know because
it's like I wear as I don't like the Sun
setting them I don't like the Sun
setting early yeah you guys now the one
who gets darker earlier and it's like
this is just stupid it's like you're
being punked by the world sure it's like
Oh ready you can now you have the time
now to go do [ __ ] and then you look
outside it's like it's 436 and it's dark
yeah and it just feels something I hate
that and then I hate going to work when
it's still like darkish out and I'm
driving and it's like starting to get
lighter oh I'm just like this this
doesn't seem this doesn't seem this
doesn't seem yeah like there's we're
still going on a clock that we were
using back in like 1700 yeah you know
like you got to wake up but that how
about no we don't have to how about
everybody makes their [ __ ] clock
start at 10 o'clock in the morning now
would [ __ ] get a little hour extra
sleep not as many people will be sleep
deprived oh so nice well so anyway so
back to my candy real quick so um so the
neighbor was like yeah we get
trick-or-treaters it's pretty popular so
I was like we should get some candy so
one my wife said this week and we're
going to like carve a pumpkin mm-hmm
I've never done that before in my life
and she was so shocked by that woman
when I was a kid we used to paint him we
used to paint pumpkins yeah I think I
painted a pumpkin yeah like I think
maybe my dad might have carved it and
then me and my sister painted it really
yeah I've never once liked like so they
said there's a whole process you can
find a logo and then you like you you
pin it like you dot out what you want
yeah like cut it out with a knife or
something like that I was like
fascinated by that only I wouldn't let
you do that [ __ ] you cut off your
fingers said he was gonna get um like
some automatic like things like the fun
in that [ __ ] know what projects mad long
to do it probably knows yeah I wish I
you know the holidays when you're
younger that they're they're cool like
it gives you a thing to look forward to
like I used to love Christmas morning
was like oh here's a bunch of [ __ ]
presents it's like [ __ ] thank you and
there's my mom when I was
kid used to do on on Easter is it so
hilarious that like they try to pretend
like and that's the day Jesus was born
and then this is the day Jesus died
meanwhile like on Easter it became a
holiday that had to do with a bunny like
oh here's bunny
it's like wheat one I thought this they
tried they like they give now those
holidays have become so like I'm not
right for it consumeristic commodified
whatever the word is for it it's like
it's so yeah corporate and modern and
how they do it it's almost like the this
the religious part of it is just such a
tiny part of it to the extent where you
don't even have to be [ __ ] religion
like Christmas now is not even it's not
a religious thing it's just everybody
celebration like over 90% of Americans
celebrate Christmas even though like 70%
of Americans or Christian or whatever
the [ __ ] the number is you know but like
the presents on Christmas were crazy and
if you think about it really is a way to
make like little kids like spoiled
little [ __ ] oh there's a [ __ ]
crazy spider on my desk oh [ __ ] that
[ __ ] just crawled right across it was
like white oh I don't know keep your eye
out for that [ __ ] you know it's like
white all right if it comes back out you
saw my skittles
well that's creepy as [ __ ] yeah it just
came right across if you run away
randomly I'll know why if you're running
from the computer people like
arachnophobia yeah I hate spiders
but I'll suck it up if I have to and
kill one if it's me oh yeah for sure
I'll get my Bruce Lee on this [ __ ] yeah
but no but to your point I remember I
think even like with churches or like
when went on the High Holidays for like
Hebrew school and stuff like that a lot
of the people just go because it's just
a way to like socialize with people like
they don't like the religious [ __ ] is in
the background all yeah of course
exactly is so secularized now that like
christmas is just like here kids have a
bunch of [ __ ] presence and we know
that'll make you happy so now you'll
like this day so that's what it was for
christmas but then for Easter when I was
a kid I may have even liked Easter more
because Easter was my mom would hide
little Easter eggs around the house and
then put like treats in them like
jellybeans writers like what jellybeans
or chocolate but she would
I did all around the house and then my
sister would do Easter egg hunt we did a
search for where she put the eggs
oh [ __ ] I found one behind the TV and
you would go [ __ ] crazy because I'm a
little like whatever six-year-old kid
like did you um did you ever wanted you
believe in Santa Claus
oh I got a good story about that I got a
good but you want to ask your second
question first and then I'll guess what
well yeah my way well my second question
was if you did when like did you did
someone tell you that Santa Claus wasn't
real cuz I never I was Jewish I didn't I
never you knew from the jump did that
[ __ ] is [ __ ] not that I didn't I
didn't really know from the jump I just
didn't think about Santa Claus like that
you know like to me I didn't it was no
real or fake it's just like I didn't
[ __ ] with Santa Claus so so I got a good
story so when I was young I for like I
guess when you're like a really really
little kid you don't you just believe
whatever they tell you and they're like
if Santa Claus is real or whatever but
then as I got older and I wasn't that
old I must have been like seven or eight
or something like that maybe a little
older I really don't remember but I was
I remember one Christmas I was looking
at porn yeah that was a little later on
I got to that eventually I was looking
at the the glass so you leave out milk
and cookies that's like a classic thing
yeah and for Santa but I remember that
one Christmas morning I'm looking at and
I'm like something right here cuz I
noticed that around the edge of the
glass where somebody took a sip of it
there was like remnants of the cookies
it was like little crumbs so the person
ate the cookie like a [ __ ] Savage
left this crumbs on the lips and then
drank some of the milk so you saw the
lip outline with the crumbs
okay and it sounds I'm like I negative
[ __ ] I knew my dad I knew my dad always
had some gross [ __ ] like that at dinner
like he would eat like a savage and then
he would drink whatever his drink was
and he put his
last down and even when I was a little
kid I'd be looking at the glass it would
be disgusting like the remnants of the
food in his lip mark on the glass you
see likes [ __ ] macaroni and cheese
[ __ ] on there like leftover crumbs from
like some [ __ ] chicken cutlets or
some [ __ ] and we just looked disgusting
and when I was a kid I used to look at
it like why don't you just [ __ ] wipe
your lips before you drink it like I was
just sickened by it yeah so I noticed
that on the glass on the milk glass I
was like and then I was walking through
I'll never forget I don't know how old I
was but I was walking through CVS with
my mom and I I just asked her I'm like
Santa's not real right and she was like
caught off guard like she wanted to lie
and keep the [ __ ] thing going yeah
but I hit her with it so out of the blue
that she was just like yeah yeah he's
not and then I think she asked me like
how'd you like how did you what happened
who told you or something and then I
told her the thing about the glass she
was like damn so I figured it out
because I noticed that weird thing and
then also you think that's what if you
like do you think there was any chatter
like I feel like that's such a big it
was before there was any chatter a
hundred percent or there was any chatter
honest I just feel like that's such a
big like mystery secret that like every
kid should as soon as they start being
able to talk and like think it should it
should be debunk you know like yeah but
here's the thing about that and this is
one of the reasons why I think religion
is really bad is that like I was and I
remember being confused at one point
between they would teach you even in
like liberal Catholic you know Sunday
school or whatever's called or us it was
like after school on a certain day it
wasn't Sunday school but it was like
religious teaching like even in the
[ __ ] liberal version of teaching it
there's like one creepy ass teacher who
tries to teach you like Adam and Eve
[ __ ] is like real and then when we got
to when we started learning a little bit
about like evolution or like a teacher
touched on it or something I
remember being like we I was told in
this other [ __ ] that it was Adam and Eve
now I'm being told that we evolved from
smaller [ __ ] things and there was a
moment of confusion and then I realized
okay well the the other [ __ ] is [ __ ]
so like but anyway my point is that once
you're taught to [ __ ] in that realm
from from when you're young and then
you're also taught the [ __ ] of Santa
it's like it doesn't seem that crazy
because you already told that some dude
walked on water that's such a good ass
point like we can't even come to
consensus like we still have people that
don't think like the Holocaust happened
and she likely yeah if we can't come to
consensus on like if the world is flat
or round yes yeah yeah so it takes a
while for a lot of people to learn that
[ __ ] and by the way my bad cuz we got a
little bit of a lag or like a little bit
of cutting in and out on your end so if
I talk over you that's why oh my bed ya
know am i bad I didn't [ __ ] hear you
but I got it now oh I got a new one
today guys oh that's no yo that's fancy
this one's fancy yeah that's the one
that they have in the bottle they're
like do you want water do you want I
just got it at the CVS so really yeah I
got a [ __ ] juice on the ground I like
how he just randomly walked away like
it's okay thousands are weird my water
uh-huh was on the ground by the door I
don't even know why oh I think I turned
the light on and I put it on the ground
because that was a weird spot for it to
republican congresswoman Marsha
Blackburn released a long ad announcing
her re-election campaign so let's have a
little laugh together and check it out
the United States Senate
it's totally dysfunctional and it's
enough to drive you nuts and that's why
I've decided to do something about it
I'm Marsha Blackburn I'm a hardcore
card-carrying Tennessee conservative I'm
politically incorrect and proud of it so
let me just say it like it is the fact
that our Republican majority in the US
Senate can't overturn Obamacare or will
not overturn Obamacare it's a disgrace
to many Senate Republicans act like
Democrats or worse and that's what we
have to change here in Tennessee I
fought my own party to stop a massive
job-killing state income tax and we
stopped it we won I know the left calls
me a wing nut or a knuckle-dragging
conservative and you know what I say
that's all right bring it on I'm 100%
pro-life I fought Planned Parenthood and
we stopped the sale of baby body parts
thank God I shoot scaped have a
concealed carry permit for the gun that
I do pack in my purse I believe our
government spends too much grows too
much and is bankrupting our children's
future I believe in president Trump's
immigration ban and I'll fight with him
every step of the way to build that wall
I stand for hundreds of millions of
honest Americans who work hard and they
play by the rules and I stand for the
greatest country the world has ever
known
I stand when the president walks in the
room and yes I stand when I hear the
star-spangled banner
a great tennessean who wasn't so
politically correct himself once said
one man with courage makes a majority
well courage comes in both genders and
I'm running for the US Senate
because I'll fight every day to make our
Republican majority act like one too
much is at stake America needs a
conservative revolution and leaders who
are willing to fight in it I'm Marsha
Blackburn that's why I'm running for the
US Senate and I would be honored to have
your vote
[Music]
make the pain stop dear God make the
pain stop so there's a so many parts of
that that are interesting to me
I like how she repeatedly calls herself
politically incorrect as she's making
the most politically correct ad I've
ever seen in my life
that's like textbook generic Republican
[ __ ] like you have the cheesy [ __ ]
music in the background and you're going
through all your dumbass talking points
I shoot skeet the [ __ ] does that have to
do with being a congressperson I'll tell
you what it has to do with being a
congressperson nothing but the reason
you say it is because you are being
politically correct to appease to your
base and you're doing it in the most
menial preposterous silly ways so as you
got your corny ass music in the
background and you talk about the [ __ ]
you do to just try to make people have a
Pavlovian response and vote for you you
say I'm politically incorrect by being a
hundred percent politically correct to
try to get votes in the most generic way
imaginable
so please you're not so these people
think I'm like oh I'm some sort of bold
iconoclast no you're not you're a
standard run-of-the-mill douchebag
Republican and by the way this is
exactly this is the congresswoman who
CNN would have on to debate Bill Nye
about climate science cuz you know
Marsha Blackburn chants genius on
climate science no she reads [ __ ]
Koch brothers and ExxonMobil talking
points and goes out there and does their
bidding so yeah I have zero love or
respect for Marsha Blackburn she's a
she's a hilariously silly person and she
built she belongs nowhere near power but
I just find it funny that uh the cheesy
musics playing in the background she's
talking about shooting skeet she's like
I'm politically incorrect then maybe you
would have not run the cheesiest ad ever
of your [ __ ] shitty music and talking
about shooting skeet okay
and then so here's the there's a
controversy over this and the
controversy is as follows
she says in that ad as you just heard I
stopped the sale of baby body parts
being done by Planned Parenthood now
here's a reality about that not only is
that a lie that's a malicious defamatory
lie so of course she's talking about
that so-called sting video it was a
far-right group that went into making
these videos trying to show Planned
Parenthood has some sort of genocidal
organization what was really happening
was there was the sale of fetal tissue
for research purposes - like you know
cure diseases now it is totally legal to
take fetal tissue and put it towards
research purposes to cure diseases and
the money that was discussed was about
shipping costs you're not allowed to
make a profit on selling fetal baby
parts for obvious reasons so the
so-called sale was just the discussion
of shipping costs to get the fetal parts
the fetal tissue to the lab to research
to cure diseases but of course these
people are malicious liars and they took
everything out of context and they made
it seem like you know Planned Parenthood
was selling baby parts for profit and so
in steps congressman Marsha Blackburn
who says I stopped the sale of baby
parts but that is totally miss stating
the facts of the situation and it's a
defamatory lie because again you're
feeding into this narrative this untrue
narrative that's been proven false a
thousand times over that Planned
Parenthood is selling baby parts it's
just not correct in fact there were
lawsuits over this and guess what the
people who made the video lost the
[ __ ] lawsuit Planned Parenthood you
know there was lawsuits involving
Planned Parenthood people who made the
video and people who made the video lost
the lawsuit because they lie and they
take [ __ ] out of context to try to make
a look
like Planned Parenthood's a genocide
organization and then by the way you
also have [ __ ] crazy far-right
terrorists who go in there and shoot up
Planned Parenthood's because they see
videos like this so it's a malicious lie
that leads to literal terror attacks and
congresswoman Blackburn goes out there
and repeats it and goes oh yes no I
stopped I stopped the sale of baby parts
well the sale of baby parts wasn't
[ __ ] happening there was discussion
of cost to get transportation so that
the fetal tissue could be used to
research curing diseases that's what was
told to the people at Planned Parenthood
they were lied to
and then the tape was taken out of
context to make it look like they were
talking about the sale for profit so she
lies repeats the lie a lie has been
proven in a court of law and guess what
as a result of this she was run she was
buying ads for this to run on Twitter
Twitter was like we're not gonna run
this [ __ ] ad we're not gonna run this
because you're [ __ ] this is this is a
brazen disgusting lie and we're in we
don't have to run whatever ad you tell
us to run we could decide we're a
private company we could say no we don't
want to run this because there's a lie
in there if you take out the part that's
alive and we'll run it and by the way
that's exactly what they said
take out the parts that that's the
brazen lie and then we'll and then we'll
run so it was taken down here I want to
read you what CBS says about this
Republican representative Marsha
Blackburn Senate campaign announcement
ad has been blocked by Twitter over a
statement the abortion rights opponent
makes about the sale of fetal tissue for
medical research Blackburn who was
running for the seat being opened by the
retirement of Tennessee senator bob
Corker okay so let me just pause for a
second um she's not running for
re-election in Congress she's running
now for bob Corker seat in the senate
cuz bob Corker stepping down anyway
let's continue boasts in the end that
she stopped the sale of baby body parts
a twitter representative told the
candidates vendors on monday that the
statement was deemed an inflammatory
statement that is likely to evoke a
strong negative reaction all right let
me pause no Twitter no that's not how
you describe it you don't describe it as
an inflammatory statement that is a lie
to evoke a strong negative reaction
because [ __ ] everything is an
inflammatory statement that's likely to
invoke a strong negative reaction in
this highly politicized world that we
live in so no that's not the reason why
you're pulling it down the reason why
you're pulling it down is what I just
stated that it is a malicious proven
defamatory lie that's the reason you're
taking it down don't water down your own
cause here and that's exactly what
they're doing oh it's an inflammatory
but no there's a million [ __ ]
statements that are inflammatory I'm
inflammatory on Twitter every day I'm
sure your inflammatory on Twitter every
day I say things that evoke a strong
negative negative reaction every day I'm
sure you do too so but that's not the
reason why one would take it down one
would take it down because it is a
literal defamatory lie that's a proven
lie that she's repeating and expecting
no consequences all right let's continue
Twitter said the Blackburn campaign
would be allowed to run the rest of the
video if the flag statement is omitted
while the decision keeps Blackburn from
paying to promote the video on Twitter
it doesn't keep it from being linked
from YouTube and other platforms okay so
in other words what they're saying is
Twitter's arguing look you want to pay
us to run the ad we're not going to run
the ad since it has that in there and we
have the right to make that choice to
make that decision but that doesn't mean
that you can't link to the YouTube video
or something on Twitter doesn't mean you
can't link to somewhere else that has
the video and put it in a tweet so
they're saying this is by no stretch of
the imagination censorship of course you
can you know link to it on Twitter
we're just saying you want to pay us to
run the ad we're not gonna run the ad
because it doesn't meet our standards
because there's a [ __ ] proven lie in
there that you know was in a court of
law
proven to be a lie so that's that's
what's happening here
now even having said all that I do think
this is a little scandalous because so
as you know and as I just made crystal
clear I'm not mincing words at all it is
a lie it's a proven lie it's a
disgusting lie it's a defamatory lie
it's as bad as it gets and should there
be accountability for it yeah I mean if
the [ __ ] if a pharmaceutical company
tries to sell a pill
and they say oh this cures cancer and it
doesn't cure cancer well guess what some
somebody's getting in trouble you can't
run that ad that's why every time you
see an ad on TV for a pill the side
effects may include diarrhea little so
they do all that because the FDA says
you have to list the side effect you
have to be accurate about it so but for
some reason for politics no you say
whatever the [ __ ] you want but then you
could just brazenly mislead people so
here at least we have a situation where
a private companies going no we're not
gonna [ __ ] let you come out here in
line but at the same time this does you
know open a can of worms this is a
slippery slope because then now you can
have nitpicking over any [ __ ]
political ad you know there are a
thousand ads that Donald Trump ran and
Hillary Clinton ran and every candidate
ran where they go well you know that
part right there's not true you know
you're stretching here here you're not
you're omitting an important part of the
picture and if you nitpick yes you could
basically find that everything is just
chock-full of lies
so I mean look if I'm Twitter as much as
it [ __ ] pains me because I know that
everything she's saying there is a lie
especially that literal defamatory lie I
still run the ad because I mean Annie
you show me definitely any Republican ad
I will immediately point out four or
five lies in the end and that's not an
exaggeration like I said they're you
they can't make a case without [ __ ]
lying so what you gonna do ban all
Republican ads banned seventy percent of
Democratic ads I just it just strikes me
as yes at the end of the day it is de
facto censorship even though this is a
case where you're like censoring and
there is a [ __ ] good reason so even
though it pains me I probably would run
the ad if I was in charge of Twitter but
let's also I just want everybody also
get the facts out there because don't
like I don't want people to make it look
like it's an open-and-shut case I'm like
oh it's just Twitter censoring
conservative voices really is
why they [ __ ] ran every other
Republican ad that has bought time no
it's not [ __ ] just censorship of
Republicans that's nonsense it's
nonsense to try to portray this as a
black-and-white issue and like oh they
just want to shut down and conserve no
it's got nothing to do with that or I'll
say would have censored every
conservative ad no this has to do with
there is a literal defamatory lie that
we know is a lie that's in there and
they say no we're not gonna be
responsible for spreading your malicious
garbage and again they can still link to
a different you know to YouTube or
anywhere else where the ad is you can
still link to that on Twitter so they're
gonna because here's what's happening
already Marsha Blackburn is playing the
victim
you know she's oh you're just wanna
center because I'm a strong conservative
woman and that is garbage that's the
same kind of like know how we talk about
mik feminism where you know it's fake
feminism like oh I guess you don't want
to vote for Hillary Clinton simply
because she's a woman this is a case of
Republicans doing make victimization
like oh I guess you don't want to run my
ad with multiple proven disgusting
defamatory lies I'm such a victim no
you're not a [ __ ] victim spare me
you're not a victim I would have run
your ads but I would have understood as
I'm doing it that there's a question as
to whether or not I should be running
them because for [ __ ] sake there is a
defamatory lie in there so I don't know
it's a difficult issue it's not a black
and white case but there you have it
I hope what happens is she actually
takes out that part and then fine
Twitter runs the ad but yes when
something is like proven in a court of
law to be a lie and you just repeat it
casually it would be nice if there were
[ __ ] consequences when there's that
big of a lie
now wouldn't there be
so if you guys remember it was just a
few days ago that in the Q&A
one of the questions was you know how do
we prevent the mainstream media from
basically railroading justice Democrats
and all efforts from the populist left
to reform the Democratic Party and make
it actually represent the people and my
response to that question was look it's
I don't even care if they attempt to
railroad us because in the process of
doing that they're only gonna make us
stronger because they're gonna [ __ ] on
us and in the process of [ __ ] on us
certainly Millennials but probably most
people would realize this smells
disingenuous and this looks pathetic so
the more they talk about is like ooh
look at look at how naughty and bad
these populist left wingers are and
they're they keep snubbing the
responsible centrist neo liberals and
that only help us and not only make us
grow and so my point was the real thing
we need to fear is indifference so in
other words if they just don't if
there's just no conversation about us
they don't cover us they don't talk
about us they pretend we don't exist
that's the real danger because that's
their best tool to try to suppress us oh
oh yeah I don't see anything I don't
hear anything they don't exist it
doesn't doesn't mean anything doesn't
matter well turns out perhaps I'm a
little too honest because it looks like
the establishment has been taking my
advice and they said whoa we're we
should shut the [ __ ] up and act like
these people don't exist so there's a
few stories that came out within the
past week week or so that it just is
this mentality personified it's just
exactly the thing that I said we need to
make sure doesn't happen
and it really is stunning and it's
really got me pissed off on another
level so first let's go over to the hill
and see what they have to say not
necessarily about the populist left and
justice democrats but about youtube okay
so it says online right fumes after
YouTube ad crackdown alright so right
there incredibly misleading and simply
wrong it's not just the right that's
like oh my god
YouTube and there D monetization it's
affecting us and it's horrible
no no you've seen me scream about it
with my hair on fire you've seen Jimmy
door do the same thing you've seen David
Pakman do the same thing because it is
drastically affecting us we don't count
though we don't count see what they're
trying to do they're trying to set it up
as no no don't worry don't worry about
the YouTube thing and the D monetization
thing because I mean that's really only
affecting people who are really
genuinely hateful and you know then
[ __ ] Nazi channels and white
nationalists and whatnot and Richard
Spencer like people say oh you don't
even worry about that it's the right
complaining about it that's an attempt
to make a normal audience go oh okay
there's whiny [ __ ] right-wingers but
it's not that's not true okay let's see
what they have to say YouTube is in hot
water with conservative users and
creators with the Google owned video
giant accused of discriminating against
the right as YouTube takes ads off
content that it says violates the Terms
of Service
last month YouTube quietly made moves to
remove advertisements on certain types
of content that it says is not
consistent with its Terms of Service
YouTube doesn't serve ads on D monetize
videos meaning big hits to the bottom
line for conservative YouTube
personalities YouTube says that its
efforts are aimed at cracking down on
hate speech but conservative and
right-wing video creators say they're
frustrated by the changes every part of
that is incorrect so far it's not just
conservatives it is 100% independent
voices and populist left voices I've
told you guys a thousand times
crushed us there was a week where we
made nothing and then after that week
it's not like ad pocalypse stopped we
still have a permanent 60% cut to our
revenue and the ads that we do get are
in like a second-tier lower level ad
it's a it's a shittier kind of ad that
doesn't pay nearly as well and it's
absolutely affecting me and it's
affecting Jimmy Dore and humanist Report
and David Pakman and you go down the
list of the left-wing channels it's 100%
affecting them because YouTube's
algorithm is so [ __ ] stupid
that it doesn't distinguish
differentiate hey this person like when
I was speaking about the the mass
shooting in Vegas and you know I came
out really against it I don't like the
murder of 59 people and the injuring of
over 500 and I called for reasonable
solutions to try to fix it nope doesn't
matter doesn't matter if you talk about
that and you say this is a horrendous
thing that counts as hate speech so the
fact that you're discussing it
demonetised
okay well that's weird then why isn't
you know the the nightly news on NBC and
ABC and CBS why aren't they demonetised
they spoke about that same thing and
they didn't even come up with
constructive solutions they just spoke
about it hey this is what happened so
what the [ __ ] is that about
I point out this is such a great example
of how [ __ ] up this system is I
covered a Human Rights Watch report that
said the u.s. killed civilians in Syria
okay - gave the number of civilians many
children were included in it so I
covered a Human Rights Watch report and
said hey this is what's actually
happening with your money in your name
this is what your government is doing
wouldn't it be great to stop this and
not kill civilians D monetize D monetize
so agreeing with a human rights group is
worthy of D monetization according to
YouTube's dumbass algorithm it is so
they don't distinguish they don't
differentiate between you know being a
neo-nazi and calling out neo-nazis and
saying hey that's bad and that's wrong
so it really is
an attempt to defund news and politics
and the broader picture here is TV used
to get all the ad money YouTube has
become so massively popular that YouTube
was starting to eclipse TV then look at
that news and politics on YouTube
defunded they leapfrog us and give money
to YouTube TV which is the same [ __ ]
old media outlets that you could have
watched on regular TV that are now on
YouTube and wow they ended up with the
money again it's almost like they're
trying to crush independent content
creators and it has nothing to do with
their political affiliation if their
right wing left wing or whatever so this
is simply an incorrect factually
inaccurate ad from the hill and it is
what is it erasing left-wing voices
you're gonna notice a theme here now
let's go to the next one so right wing
watch came out with what they're
considering like an investigative report
here it's beyond me why they call it
that but it says white supremacy figured
out how to become YouTube famous ok so
right off the bat you could say yeah
there are some people who are you know
maybe hardcore white nationalists who
have a voice now that they didn't have
previously but look that's the that's
what you're gonna get with a free and
open platform you're gonna get good
ideas that spread or you're gonna get
shitty ideas that spread you're gonna
get good news that spreads and you're
gonna get [ __ ] Alex Jones Infowars
garbage and it spreads that's just par
for the course that's not totally
inaccurate the point that ok maybe some
white supremacist or white nationalists
have blown up on YouTube of course that
happened but there are also a lot of
good voices to counter that that have
risen up as well there's no mention of
those voices but I'm not at the point
yet where I'm pissed off with this now
let's start reading the piece YouTube is
home to a seemingly endless variety of
videos that reach all kinds of viewers
and is creeping up on TV as the
most-watched video platform in the
United States but as John Herman
documented in The New York Times
Magazine last month political punditry
on YouTube is vastly dominated dominated
by right-wing talkers some of the site's
most notable right-wing political stars
include the always camera-ready men and
women at the info war studio frequently
shirtless 4chan Muse how I don't even
know how to say that I'm gonna
try and by the way never [ __ ] heard
of him an elaborate cosplay cartoon
character mr. de portent although these
figures differ vastly in format and tone
their messages are aligned exclusively
towards the hard uncompromising right
and have been increasingly influenced by
their even more extremist counterparts
on YouTube so they're saying the right
is quote dominating YouTube where's the
data for that notice they give no
numbers they give no facts they give no
information they just say it that the
rights dominating YouTube right
dominating you to everybody you
mentioned of every right-wing outlet you
mentioned and they mentioned the biggest
one there Infowars TYT alone beats them
all now you could you could agree or
disagree with you it doesn't matter but
they absolutely obliterate everybody
there I obliterate most of the people on
that list so too progressive channels
crush all the right-wingers you just
named but you're doing a piece about how
the right quote dominates YouTube
I think tu IT has something to say about
that I think I have something to say
about that I think Jimmy Dore has
something to say about that
I think humanists report has something
to say about that I think Tim Black has
something to say about that I think
David Pakman has something to say about
that that is complete and utter nonsense
but I haven't even gotten to the worst
one yet
okay so that stuff got me super pissed
off because hey I'm a I'm a left-wing
political commentator I do news in
politics we've been affected
horrendously by this ad crackdown the D
monetization ad pocalypse or race to us
act like we don't count and make
otherwise normal people go yeah I guess
it's not that big a deal cuz it's
apparently only right-wing voices who
are affected because that's what you
know that's what these articles say you
ready for the biggest erasure of them
all take a look at this Bernie backers
give dem incumbents a pass in 2018
what
the Sanders Clinton schism isn't
plaguing the party in Senate races so
far
instead it's Republicans still facing
intra-party heat there it is there it is
that is [ __ ] unbelievable justice
Democrats
we're running 16 candidates so far 16
Paula Swearengen who's running against
Joe Manchin had one of the biggest
reddit you know ask me anything ever
we're running 16 candidates were gaining
in popularity from the grassroots you
guys we've raised millions of dollars no
core for money no PAC money just from
you millions of dollars
we're aligned with our revolution people
for Bernie Democratic socialists fight
for 15 you go down the list of populist
left activists brand-new Congress
National Nurses United there is unity on
the populist left fighting for all of
the ideas that we know are the right
policies that the American people
already agree with Medicare for all free
college ending the wars new New Deal
money out of politics and the drug war
we're fighting for these things day in
day out you're fighting for these things
day in day out you're the reason that
Congress went from what 70 people
backing Medicare for all to a hundred
and eighteen you're the reason for that
you're the reason you're the reason now
Democratic senators are coming out for
Medicare for all and what are those I
there's no there's no Democratic Civil
War Bernie backers aren't primary
Hillary people not only are we doing it
I literally have no idea how we could
have done more
we've done everything from the day the
2016 election was over till today you
have done everything in your power to
fight back against neoliberal
corporatist centrists who are Republican
Lite who agree with the Republicans on
deregulation and tax cuts for the rich
and endless wars and so-called free
trade deals that outsource good American
manufacturing jobs you've done
everything in your power to fight back
against these people you are primary
knees people and you're doing it to try
to save the country and get the right
policies implemented and what the [ __ ]
does Politico say Bernie backers give
dem incumbents a pass in 2018 the
Sanders Clinton schism isn't plaguing
the party in Senate races so far instead
it's Republicans still facing
intra-party heat where primary enseña
ters we're primary and congressman there
are people who are running at the state
and local level there's a Bernie backed
candidate just won a mayor's race the
other day they're erasing you they are
erasing left-wing voices in the same way
the establishment just magically
magically erased myself david pakman TYT
Tim black humanist Report you go down
the list jimmy dore left-wing political
commentators on youtube in the same way
they just said you don't exist you don't
exist you weren't massively hurt by the
youtubes d monetization you don't exist
you don't count for whatever reason
here's my [ __ ] rationalizations you
don't mean anything even though your
numbers are even stronger than the ones
on the right the right is dominating
YouTube in the same way they [ __ ]
erased us from existence with their
shitty articles that's the same way they
just erased you and all the hard work
you've done to try to get this country
back on the right track we can't let
this stand I'm more motivated now than
I've ever been before
this reinvigorates me because I want to
make it so that they're denying us as we
are metaphorically digging their
political graves you want to keep them
up fine keep denying me keep denying us
when we're [ __ ] number one on YouTube
in news and politics keep T YT is number
one on for news and politics on YouTube
denied they don't exist though the right
dominates you to be dominated as we I
want justice Democrats I want us to win
every single race we're in so we can
[ __ ] rub it in their face and go say
it again
what happened what happened Oh Bernie
backers gave Hillary Clinton people a
pass by [ __ ] routing them and
defeating every single one of them and
fighting and winning on Medicare for all
and free college and a living wage what
happened oh we gave them a pass by
absolutely owning them and destroying
them and fixing [ __ ] America yeah we
gave him a pass that's what it is we're
giving dem incumbents a pass by primary
Ingush it out of them and scaring the
pants off of them but this is their
strategy don't cover them see no ever
evil hear no evil pretend they don't
exist and then maybe it'll go away you
done [ __ ] up cuz you pissed us off
more now you pissed us off more now guys
support left-wing causes groups
candidates you agree with cuz you're our
only hope is if we all get together and
we all fight for these things cuz the
establishment will never recognize you
will never recognize us will never give
us our due apparently are much larger
YouTube show than other right-wing
YouTube shows doesn't count for variety
reason I don't know he's not sexy enough
he doesn't call for [ __ ] ethnic
cleansing and purging the country of all
immigrants he just talks about health
care all day not sexy enough doesn't
count doesn't count
Louise Bernie Sanders supporters who are
fighting that they don't count they
don't count there
pushing for immensely popular policies
and they're trying to fix the Democratic
Party in fix the country they don't
count for a variety of reasons so make
them eat their own words and their own
shitty articles okay
make them do it justice Democrats calm
slash fight justice Democrats dot-com
slash fight if they're not gonna cover
us and they're not gonna get the word
out to people who would support us if
they knew we existed then we have to do
it just as Democrats dot-com slash fight
make your donation today let's make them
eat their words
let's win every [ __ ] race we're in so
we can come back and laugh about this
article Bernie backers give dem
incumbents a pass by beating all of them
wouldn't that be a great addition to
that title let's make it happen
holla holla holla here welcome to the
kyln quorum podcast today I will be
speaking with the white Malcolm X how
much is the one you know is it the Wi-Fi
or is it not honest not the Wi-Fi think
it was my I think I unplug my headphones
been there done that and now the new
iPhone has a like a USB cord that it
comes with like an adapter yeah you were
talking about the headphones last time
you hate that you wanted them to just
put your phone jack in there sucks yeah
I'm used to I I never used the
headphones on my old iPhone so like me
plugging it right into the thing where
the charger goes in it didn't bother me
I was like whatever I don't care
wait you had the adapter you didn't have
the adapter no no so I'm talking about
when I had the iPhone 4 oh I had an
iPhone 4 forever because that's that
dude who doesn't like to change like now
I have iPhone 7 I probably will get rid
of it in the year 2026 and that might
not be an exaggeration so like I believe
when they came out with like the first
like iPod yeah I had the mini the iPod
mini like the first iPod mini did you
have a color one or no no just the
regular silver one cuz like once they
started coming out with the color ones
those well they first came out with that
Mac computers back in the day remember
when they had those shits and it was
like a different colored ones yeah
yeah I never got one of those but like I
think one of my friends maybe had like
the the turquoise one or the orange one
those would have been the only colors
they made for for the old Mac computers
yeah you remember they had like the
colored computers hmm yeah I think I do
but didn't they come in a whole bunch of
different colors I feel like they did
but the only ones I could remember was
like it's like a turquoise blue and an
orange one I don't I can't
I don't can't picture like and I
remember the old old old Macs when Mac
was like not even Mac yet like the Apple
computers yeah like when the keyboard
was connected to the actual computer
yeah yeah I remember those I feel like
we use them back in school like way way
way back in the day
yeah those were the ones we played like
Oregon Trail and all that [ __ ] oh yeah
and I got dysentery and died I had or
clock cholera or some [ __ ] I had the
iPhone 4 and I never used like I'm I'm
not that person that like you know
listens to podcasts sorry I'm getting a
phone call I gotta turn that [ __ ] off
what is your ringtone sounded like a
like a old like hippopotamus or
something like that
oh you heard the thing I thought I heard
like ah alright I think it's just like
no it's I got the normal ringtone thing
but I think it's just uh maybe it comes
into our call like that Oh maybe cuz I
got the call on my iPhone and we're
talking on a Mac and so it linked up and
hit the [ __ ] number Oh corner of the
screen and I was like what the [ __ ] is
this Oh anyway I was gonna say I had
that iPhone 4 I'm not that kind of
person that like usually listens to like
podcast and [ __ ] on my phone and I just
started doing that more recently but I
used to have an i the the headphone plug
that like I didn't use that on my iPhone
4 so for me to plug it straight into the
charger port thing didn't bother me I
was like whatever it's same [ __ ] sure
wait so what do you so do you have the
port at the bottom of the 7 you do right
you could just plug in that head right
see that see that oh you don't have a
plug it in I plug it right into the
charger thing okay I got the same thing
yeah you always had that no I used to
have a little circular thing and I could
plug in any type of headphones no no I
know no I know but I thought you were
saying you didn't realize you could plug
you know that you had headphones now
that would plug directly into that thing
- charger thing well I need the adapter
that came with the phone yeah the thing
yeah the headphones that our on a
[ __ ] wire that plug right into this
is that the adapter thing you're talking
about
no the adapter thing I'm talking about
is like a tiny little thing that like I
could plug into my like the end of the
regular headphone has like has like the
I don't know has like a pointy looking
thing huh that plugs into this tiny
little adapter that plugs into the phone
oh so you didn't get so when you bought
your iPhone 7 it didn't come with the
headphones that connected strong the
charger thing mine did oh I just bought
seven and with it came headphones that
plug directly into that no see even well
okay so that's why you were so mad is
because it day didn't even it's not like
they gave you an option of here here's
headphones at work no it was headphones
here's an adapter plug your adapter into
your headphones oh wow why do I like
automatically get that with my iPhone
and you didn't I don't know they sort of
hooked you up cuz the eight they must
have reverted back or some [ __ ] I don't
know I have no idea but that's weird but
anyway you were just watching the the
Yankee game
yeah I'm still watching I got it in the
background of our laptop right now so if
I look like I'm looking at you with like
a cockeyed lazy eye it's because that's
good look at the Yankee game directly
behind the screen okay I don't watch
baseball so catch me up on what exactly
is happening is it so baseball is
usually boring as full yeah three hours
long and it's just usually like just a
bunch of boring this and if you are
following Oh turn the DoublePlay
so yeah usually it's boring because if
someone is a star player they only bat
like four times a game so if you're
trying to watch this then they only come
up to bat every whatever so innings but
this is um
the Yankees make this is technically the
playoffs so the Yankees made the
playoffs because they won the wild-card
mm-hmm
it's like you could win your division
but then you can also win the wildcard
so every other team that doesn't win
their division battles to win the
wildcard so the ink is won the wild card
but then they they implemented this new
rule a couple years ago with the top two
teams play each other to decide who
plays in like a series mm-hmm it's sort
of sounds complicated it's really sort
of stupid and complicated so this is a
one game playoff to decide who will
actually play in like a series against
Cleveland okay but it's not for they're
not eliminated if they don't win no if
they lose they're eliminated yeah this
is [ __ ] yeah so the first inning
they were down three nothing oh [ __ ] and
then dude came up in the bottom of the
first inning and hit a home run so they
tied at three three so it's for four
right now is pretty exciting hey what
inning is it third inning okay
oh that's pretty early in the game is
real early in its highest glory what are
they playing on the west coast or
something
another plane in New York really damn
that's weird what time the game start
8:30 a 8 o'clock New York time okay yeah
um what so what's the deal with all the
NBA trades I heard there were big moves
that happened recently
yo Melo is in OKC now so he's with
Russell Westbrook and who else Paul
George is with OKC okay um Chris Paul
went to the Hornets he was back in the
day he was there right no he was with uh
New Orleans yeah I'm sorry did I say
Hornets I meant Houston Rockets oh he
went okay yeah he so he I was right he
was with yep um white Howard's on the
Hornets now with who Anthony Davis still
no no Anthony Davis won New Orleans New
Orleans Hornets New Orleans pelicans Oh
New Orleans pelicans they don't exist
anymore little Charlotte okay yeah they
brought them back okay they're like
random players and then weights on the
Cavs now any weight on the Cavs and
Albert they got the old heat back at the
in Cleveland now yep pretty much Chris
Bosh still has like crazy heart problems
and he's just like probably dying to be
playing basketball somewhere is he yeah
he's just dead he's no he's not dead but
he's uh he's he is like a heart problem
and he doesn't play right now
and where's melot melot is Houston
he's OKC okay sorry yep and he's doing
this thing now they call him hoodie Melo
because he had like some videos of him
playing and like the local gyms back
home and the offseason where he wears a
hood so like his whole [ __ ] now is like
he wears a hood when he plays and that's
like his whole like mantra type of thing
it'd be like if you did your show and
always wore like a like a blue coat on
like Thursdays or something like that
and just everybody knew it was like oh
no Kyle wears a blue coat on Thursday
you should do some [ __ ] like that I wear
t-shirts pretty often over my coat but
people are like don't people where it's
like every Monday they know they're
gonna tune in and see you know like
you're secular talk shirt
like that or people were talking I did a
Q&A for 500,000 subs and one of the main
questions was like can you show us your
legs and it's like you [ __ ]
have seen it like there I've there
videos of me on the chat like there was
one I put up my golf swing from way back
in the day and people saw my my legs
yeah there's a picture I put up I think
from 88 like you were teeing up a putt
and you could see your legs like I mean
you have legs yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah the one where it was like from high
school and you see my legs yeah here
I'll try to show people now but I got
wires and [ __ ] they probably don't they
probably are like yeah watch he's
paralyzed you can't move his [ __ ] on his
own and I got shorts on so calm down I'm
not naked for all you who are wondering
sometimes that [ __ ] is crazy though you
see that in I don't know if I seen it in
movies or just in real life but like
someone to be running or doing something
and all of a sudden they'll just like
take their leg off and you're just like
whoa like means like take their leg off
like you don't expect that the person
was like an amputee or something like
that so I guess people have a right to
be questioning because they've never
really seen legs often your legs
well FDR went while he was president
right then people didn't know that he
was in a wheelchair for a while mm-hmm
like he was always in a wheelchair and
people didn't know they just because
every time they saw him it was like with
me like I was just always sitting that's
I'm saying I know a kid here in Chicago
he played in a basketball league I
played in and when we started playing in
the league he healed like a full set of
hair and everything was good and all the
pictures that he was taken in and like
his Instagram pictures you could see his
hair um and then towards the end of the
basketball league maybe like a couple
years later he started losing his hair
and one day he came into the gym because
he can't play ball with a hat on
and I think he owns like his father
owned a car dealership or something like
that so he doesn't work in a
professional type like setting where
he'd have to you know not where I had or
you know show is show the top of his
hair so he came to the basketball game
one of the last years I was
they are playing in the league and he
had to take his hat off and he had like
shaved his head and it was like bald but
he was still trying to figure out what
the look was like if he was gonna shave
his head or keep it totally bald and
then going forward all the pictures he
was posting or with a hat on so people
just probably assumed that he still had
his hair so then when you took it off
everybody's like what the [ __ ]
yep nobody like in outside reality world
who saw him probably just suits still
assumed he had hair yeah he didn't it
was a shock every time he took his hat
off [ __ ] is this yeah some people look a
lot better with that on them with the
head off yeah 100% I before I was
married I would go to there was a
shallow girl that I just remembered it's
just we were at a bar one time I think
it was Mickey Spillane
she was talking to a guy and I think I
overheard it and she was just like like
take your hat off like let me see if you
have hair and I was just like you're so
like like who says that like why would
you even say that that is a little blunt
but in her defense I mean if you're a
girl and you're about to date a guy
you're gonna want to know like what his
situation is up top yeah I guess I
respect it I mean you're not dating a
guy but like you still you can't have a
conversation with the guy and then
eventually like he was hitting on her
you think oh I mean who goes just like
hold on here
take off your that's good that's like if
a guy's talking to a girl he's like what
pause excuse me turn around let me see
your ass is your ass nice enough to
continue this conversation you guys do
that please turn around and it's like
okay anyway what were you saying we can
proceed on this conversation now that'd
be so weird that's like um don't like
math professors do that as some [ __ ]
like you have to like like solve some
equation before they I mean like oh they
do that for big job interviews like for
really big tech companies that are yes
yeah they'll I ask you like some
preposterous ly hard question and you
can yeah yeah so I would hate that [ __ ]
I had a friend I think you know him but
he
he was interviewing with Google or
something like [ __ ] like that
yeah and they I don't know if they like
tapped his phone or he got a survey to
his phone to like answer like to pass
this test and answer these certain
questions um that's a little weird if
they've literally like I don't know if
they tap something right to his phone
well no they definitely sent something
to his phone because he said he was in
an uber or something like that and got
like this random survey or questionnaire
from Google that he had to answer and
pass the test I think prior to his job
interview or something like that or
maybe like the second round of a job
interview which to me is crazy
yeah they don't work in there well yeah
there's some you know probably probably
Apple does that too I bet Google does
that Apple does that any any big tech
company where it's like a really high
paying job and you do like really high
level [ __ ] thinking about this before
like can you blame them because
ultimately any job interview if I'm
going there and I'm interviewing just
one time like you you can't [ __ ]
decide if you know yeah it depends what
the job is I'd imagine four jobs like
that they just want to really really
highly competent people in the field so
if they ask you a really difficult
question in that field then yeah that's
a fair game but I wouldn't want to put
myself in that position yeah like where
they ask a question where it's like you
have to not it's almost like you have to
also on top of getting the answer right
and having the ability to get the answer
right it's almost like you have to
suppress any nervousness you might have
at that point in time and you know what
I mean yeah it's just a very difficult
thing but job interviews in general I
mean when I went through a job interview
I think I had to write out like answers
to a question and had to be like
grammatically correct and there had to
be punctuation and I was just like [ __ ]
man like that's tough like so it was
like it's almost like they give you they
put roadblocks in your way just to see
if you will get past the roadblocks just
to see if you're obedient enough to
listen to them when you're hired
yeah you know what I mean yeah it's like
here do all
menial nonsensical things and if you
complete these menial nonsensical things
well then you can work for us because I
know that now when I tell you do
anything you're gonna do it go get
coffee go do this go do that and it's
like okay you know what I mean so it's
like yeah be servile okay here I'm being
that way all right you're on it yeah
yeah I don't like this I don't like that
I mean the job interview outside of the
actual job interview when you sit down
with your boss like so say you go into
the offices and it's like conversation
part of it
the conversation part of it it should be
nothing the whole job interview and and
I've had to hire people for my old job I
hired basketball trainers the job
interview should be when you are sending
the emails to them to set up the job
interview to see like how fast they
respond to how quick they answer their
phone calls I bet people weigh that sure
I bet people way that I mean they'd be
silly not to yeah you know because when
I sit down and talk with them I'm
already I already have in my mind like
all right this dude wrote back to me
within an hour you know he you know he
said he gets off work at 4:00 he was you
know he was here 15 minutes early like
all the [ __ ] that's pretty rude to the
interview is all the [ __ ] that I've
already plugged into my mind like I like
yeah I don't care what he says right now
because he was here on time he did
everything properly to be in this pot
right now yeah you know it is almost
certain extent it's almost like a
popularity contest
you know it's like all right can you get
the balls to like you if you can and
that's probably for most jobs for those
high-level tech jobs and we were talking
about it probably is a lot more of a
meritocracy and based on you know
competence in whatever field it is or
what are the specifics of that field are
yeah for most jobs it's probably just a
likability contest and I mean that is
kind of [ __ ] up too though when you
think about it because if it's a
likeability contest then that means
there's somebody who might be really
good at the job but not very personable
might get [ __ ] yep
you know yeah that's not cool man that's
not cool
yeah it sucks I mean we spoke about this
[ __ ] like you can't you can't figure out
what someone's like after speaking with
them for one time you know I remember
one time back in the day you might
remember this friend of mine I won't say
his name but he he was selling [ __ ]
kitchen utensils
like selling these [ __ ] kit boxes of
kitchen utensils and they were
supposedly like really good kitchen
utensils or some [ __ ] feel like I know
who was but you probably did we'll talk
better all fair I just don't like give
people random shouts if they don't want
it but yeah um but I was like I could do
that [ __ ] cuz it was easy enough like
okay you just sell these things every
now and then and whatever you make a
hundred bucks or whatever the [ __ ] it
might be every time you sell it and so I
went to this thing where they have like
a big-ass job interview and you narrow
it down so they were like maybe 15 or 20
people there to start with and I went
there and I was wearing my [ __ ] suit
and [ __ ] I don't know how old I was
probably to be like 17 18 or some [ __ ]
and and then so they narrow it down I
end up being one of like two or three
people that gets it and so now I got the
job of selling these you know utensil
things and I just never sold it I was
like I'm not gonna I don't feel like it
like it was so weird just a bizarre
[ __ ] thing but anyway the point of
